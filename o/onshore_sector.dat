Nevertheless, correlation with deep marine isotope stages is tentative and relies on relative dating as absolute dating techniques are difficult to apply. Here, we present for the first time an early Quaternary, high-resolution benthic stable isotope record from the <b>onshore</b> <b>sector</b> of the Netherlands, taken from borehole Noordwijk.

40|$|The Vlora Bay is {{a roughly}} north‐west–south‐east‐oriented tectonic {{depression}} {{located at the}} collision zone between the Apulian Foreland and the Albano‐Hellenic Chain in south‐western Albania. The bay exhibits a triangular‐shaped geometry, {{which is the result}} of different tectonic phases that occurred mostly between the end of the Neogene and the Quaternary. The bay consists of two distinct physiographic sections: a shallow water marine offshore area and a recently emerged <b>onshore</b> <b>sector.</b> Along the <b>onshore</b> <b>sector,</b> Pleistocene clastic sediments filling the Pleistocene Vlora Basin crop out due to the recent uplift phases. The sedimentological and stratigraphic organization of the Vlora Basin deposits and the role played by Quaternary tectonic structures in their deposition are the main topics of this paper. A detailed field survey, supported by a geoelectrical survey, reveals a series of unconformity‐bounded stratigraphic units deposited in two north‐west–south‐east‐oriented subbasins. The two subbasins are separated by an intrabasinal, fault‐bounded, pre‐Quaternary morpho‐structural high and are mainly filled by shallow marine to continental deposits. A detailed structural analysis shows different tectonic phases affecting the area during the Pleistocene. Additionally, the geophysical survey facilitates the reconstruction of the deep structure of the basin and provides a better definition of the basin margins. Based on both geological and geophysical data, a tectonostratigraphic evolutionary model is proposed for the Vlora Basin Pleistocene sedimentary infill. This model consists of three phases of sedimentation that were essentially controlled by fault activity and by the progressive uplift of the area...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to perform a cost benefits analysis of the wind power sector in Germany, with the horizon of 2030. Various costs and benefits stemming from the expansion of wind power are inferred from literature review and studying the peculiarities of the German case. The magnitude of governmental support is calculated by applying the Weibull distribution of wind at different zones across Germany and power curves of 5 modern wind turbines, as specified by the law. A number of sensitivity analyses is performed on the main inputs for onshore installations. Under the baseline assumptions, the <b>onshore</b> <b>sector</b> is found as non-beneficial to the society, without a visible improving trend for the future. While the offshore sector does not {{reach a point where}} the benefits would start overweighing the cost until 2030, the overall trend look much more promising.

40|$|Two {{years of}} data from the coastal {{measurement}} station at Skipheia in Norway have been analysed to characterise the atmospheric turbulence intensity (TI) in the wind. In addition to consider all data at 70 meters in one, two direction sectors have been chosen to represent onshore and offshore conditions. The turbulence intensity has been investigated in terms of atmospheric stability, seasonal variations, diurnal patterns and measurement height. Additionally, the results are compared to predictions for TI given by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) through the Normal Turbulence Model (NTM). Previous work has found NTM to be incompatible with coastal and offshore measurements, and {{this is also the}} case in the current study. For Skipheia, TI in the offshore sector was observed to be slightly less than in the <b>onshore</b> <b>sector,</b> and the diurnal TI pattern more pronounced in the latter. In addition, differences in TI between the two sectors are more distinct in summer than in winter.

40|$|Offshore {{wind power}} (OSW) {{plays a key}} role within the UK {{strategy}} for a transition towards a low-carbon economy, offering vast potential for establishing a high-tech manufacturing industry. Previous experiences in the <b>onshore</b> <b>sector</b> (OWP) suggest the UK might fail in fully capturing these macroeconomic benefits. In this work, we investigate the history of UK renewable policies, comparing its national strategy to those of other major OSW-export countries. Through the use of a numerical general equilibrium model, we quantify the macroeconomic impacts under three scenarios: a baseline, which relies on previous estimates and foresee limited local content; a ‘contamination’ scenario, where the UK content reaches the same levels of OWP; and a ‘non-myopic’ scenario, where investors expect governmental support to decrease or disappear, replicating a common path of past renewable policies. We identify the UK as a FDI-oriented country. Our results suggest that increasing the share of locally-sourced capital goods in OSP to OWP-level could generate larger income and employment effects in the UK economy. We find that under forward-looking investors the economic benefits are significantly lower than the case of myopic agents. Our results show an inherent conflict with stated purposes of UK policy for OSW. JRC. B. 3 -Territorial Developmen...|$|E

40|$|Shear wave {{velocities}} (VS) {{are defined}} in the uppermost 1 - 2 km of the Campi Flegrei caldera through the non-linear inversion of the group velocity dispersion curves of fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves extracted from ambient noise cross-correlations between two receivers. Noise recordings, three months long, at 12 seismic stations are cross-correlated between all couples of stations. The experiment provided successful results along 54 paths (inter-stations distance), of which 27 sampled a depth greater than 1 km. VS contour lines are drawn from 0. 06 km b. s. l. to 1 km depth b. s. l. and show difference between the offshore (gulf of Pozzuoli and coastline) and the onshore areas. At 0. 06 km b. s. l., the gulf of Pozzuoli and the coastline are characterized by VS of 0. 3 - 0. 5 km/s and of 0. 5 - 0. 7 km/s, respectively. Such velocities are typical of Neapolitan pyroclastic soils and fractured or altered tuffs. The inland shows VS in the range 0. 7 - 0. 9 km/s, typical of Neapolitan compact tuffs. Velocities increase with depth and, at 1 km depth b. s. l., velocities lower than 1. 5 km/s are still present {{in the gulf and}} along the coastline while velocities higher than 1. 9 km/s characterize the eastern sector (grossly coincident with the Neapolitan Yellow Tuff caldera rim), the S. Vito plain and the area between Solfatara and SW of Astroni. Such features are much more evident along two cross-sections drawn in the offshore and <b>onshore</b> <b>sectors</b> by integrating our VS models with literature data. Our models join previous noise cross-correlation studies at greater scale at depths of 0. 7 - 0. 8 km, hence the picture of the Campi Flegrei caldera is shown up to a depth of 15 km. VS of about 1. 7 km/s, corresponding to VP of about 3 km/s (computed by using the VP/VS ratio resulted in the inversion), are found at depths of 1. 1 km, in the centre of the gulf of Pozzuoli, and at a depth of about 0. 7 km b. s. l. onshore. An increment of VS velocity (1. 9 - 2. 0 km/s) is locally observed onshore which might be attributed to a layer of tuffs and tuffites interbedded with thin lava beds, according to the correlation of VS with stratigraphies in the deep drillings of S.

40|$|The Gulf of Patti and its <b>onshore</b> <b>sector</b> {{represent}} one of {{the most}} seismically active regions of the Italian Peninsula. Over the period 1984 – 2014, about 1800 earthquakes with small-to-moderate magnitude and a maximum hypocentral depth of 40 km occurred in this area. Historical catalogues reveal that the same area was affected by several strong earthquakes such as the Mw = 6. 1 event in April 1978 and the Mw = 6. 2 one in March 1786 which have caused severe damages in the surrounding localities. The main seismotectonic feature affecting this area is represented by a NNW–SSE trending right-lateral strike-slip fault system called ‘‘Aeolian–Tindari–Letojanni’’ (ATLFS) which has been interpreted as a lithospheric transfer zone extending from the Aeolian Islands to the Ionian coast of Sicily. Although the large-scale role of the ATLFS is widely accepted, several issues about its structural architecture (i. e. distribution, attitude and slip of fault segments) and the active deformation pattern are poorly constrained, particularly in the offshore. An integrated analysis of field structural geology with marine geophysical and seismological data has allowed to better understand the structural fabric of the ATLFS which, in the study area, is expressed by two major NW–SE trending, en-echelon arranged fault segments. Minor NNE–SSW oriented extensional structures mainly occur in the overlap region between major faults, forming a dilatational stepover. Most faults display evidence of active deformation and appear to control the main morphobathymetric features. This aspect, together with diffused continental slope instability, must be considered for the revaluation of the seismic and geomorphological hazard of this sector of southern Tyrrhenian Sea...|$|E
40|$|The <b>onshore</b> <b>sector</b> of the West Iberian Margin (WIM) was {{the locus}} of several cycles of magmatic {{activity}} during the Mesozoic, the most voluminous of which was of alkaline nature and occurred between 70 and 100 Ma. This cycle {{took place in a}} post-rift environment, during the 35 ° counter-clockwise rotation of Iberia and initiation of the alpine compression. It includes the subvolcanic complexes of Sintra, Sines, and Monchique, the volcanic complex of Lisbon and several other minor intrusions, covering an area of approximately 325 km 2. Previous cycles were tholeiitic and transitional in nature, occuring around 200 Ma and 130 - 135 Ma, respectively. New LA-ICP-MS U-Pb, 40 Ar/ 39 Ar, K-Ar and Rb-Sr ages on several intrusions distributed along the onshore WIM are presented, which combined with previously published data allows us to constrain the duration of the Late Cretaceous alkaline cycle to circa 22 Ma (94 - 72 Ma) and define two pulses of magmatic activity. The first one (94 - 88 Ma) occurred during the opening of the Bay of Biscay and consequent rotation of Iberia and clusters above N 38 ° 20 ′. The second pulse (75 - 72 Ma) has a wider geographical distribution, from N 37 ° to N 39 °. This final pulse occurred during the initial stages of the Alpine orogeny in Iberia that {{led to the formation of}} the Pyrenees and Betics and to tectonic inversion of the Mesozoic basins. Isotope and trace element geochemistry point to a sublithospheric source for the alkaline magmatism that clearly distinguishes it from the previous cycles which had an important lithospheric mantle component. Also, it allows the discrimination between the two different alkaline pulses in terms of trace element abundance and residual mantle minerology. It is speculated that these differences might be the result of distinct magma ascent rates due to either more or less favourable tectonic settings that avoided or allowed the interaction with metasomatized lithosphere and equilibration with K rich minerals like amphibole and/or phlogopite...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 The {{relationship}} between intrinsic fish quality (fish condition before handling), production efficiency, product price, and the optimal management of commercial "wild" fisheries was explored in four companion papers. The optimal management plan-consisting of quotas and harvest schedules - would maximize the discounted net industry revenues (NPV) given a minimum biomass level. The first paper used information on biological changes in Pacific whiting and corresponding production yields to model a vertically integrated fishery from harvest through processing. The seasonal, nonlinear, bioeconomic programming model incorporated stock dynamics with the interactive economic effects of intrinsic fish quality, the harvest schedule, and the quota allocation between heterogeneous user groups. NPV was maximized when the intraseason timing of harvest {{coincided with the}} seasonal improvement in fish quality that follows spawning and migration. NPV was only marginally affected, however, by the quota allocation. The second paper employed processing-level surimi data to estimate the effect of production and policy-controlled variables on quality characteristics. Hedonic equations were then estimated to obtain the implicit price of each characteristic in distinct markets. Implicit prices were also estimated for grade, production location (onshore, at-sea), and production date. Results indicated that (1) species and the time between processing and harvesting both significantly affected the characteristics, (2) color and gel strength attributes had the largest price effect, and (3) market conditions can diminish the price effect of production-controlled factors. The third paper defined a theoretical model for managing commercial wild-caught fisheries. The model demonstrated that a delay in harvesting can increase NPV and stock size through improvements in intrinsic fish quality that positively impact production yields, fish size, and product price. In the empirical application, improved yields, heavier fish, and higher prices increased NPV by 38, 6, and 25 percent, respectively; multiplicative effects accounted for the remaining 31 percent. Sensitivity analysis in the final paper found that the optimal allocation to the <b>onshore</b> <b>sector</b> was inversely related {{to the size of}} the recruiting cohort due to current capacity constraints (relative to the average annual harvest). In addition, the policy objective(s) and interseason variability in intrinsic quality influenced NPV and the optimal management plan...|$|E
40|$|The onshore {{resource}} {{conflicts that}} have {{erupted in the}} Eastern states of Australia highlight the deep need for axiomatic structural change in public resource ownership frameworks. Much of the conflict that has arisen stems from {{the failure of the}} state, as owner, to give proper regard to the social and environmental concerns relevant to the expansion of onshore resource development. The underlying rationale for vesting resources in the state is to ensure they are managed {{for the benefit of the}} community as a whole. The implied sumption is that public benefit obligations are met through state administration because this is the most effective means of reinjecting the financial gains of resource exploitation back into the community. This article argues that the dramatic social and environmental impacts associated with a transitioning <b>onshore</b> resource <b>sector</b> have fundamentally altered this perspective. In this environment, the public interest obligations of the state transcend efficiency imperatives. In a modern public resource framework the state can only properly comply with its core public interest obligations where the social and environmental concerns of impacted communities regarding onshore resource development are effectively managed. This structural realignment coheres with the emergence of a more attuned and environmentally engaged communitarian network. This article draws upon social obligation jurisprudence, including land ethics, the public trust doctrine and the doctrine of propriety, to argue that the public ownership of resources has always been qualified by strong communitarian obligations. Responding to these obligations in a timely and effective manner has, in the context of onshore resource expansion, become a public interest imperative. This is apparent not only from the growing formal importance of social licencing protocols in resource development projects but also, at a more fundamental level, in the normative drive towards ecological progression and improved structural consistency between human and natural law...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The energy {{debate is}} {{characterized}} by the consideration of a great variety of arguments. However, nowadays, a certain consensus is reached when demanding the necessary coexistence of different generation sources in the energy mix, in order to guarantee the supply, hold the costs or reduce the CO 2 emissions. Considering this framework, the use of renewable energies seems to be obvious: they are abundant, domestic and their contribution to the fight against the climate change is unquestionable. The ocean, covers a 75 % of the earth’s surface, represents a huge reserve of solar and gravitational energy, still to be exploited, estimated in a minimum value of 25. 000 GW. The waves, tides and winds of the seas that border the north coast of the Iberian Peninsula are rough and offer a huge kinetic energy potential. Furthermore, Galicia benefits from its consolidated shipbuilding and maritime tradition and port infrastructures, its experience in the <b>onshore</b> wind energy <b>sector,</b> {{as well as from the}} available industrial resources and technologies. By analysing previous reports, the present paper aims to identify the Galicia potential for the use of renewable marine energies, specifically coming from waves, tidal streams and offshore winds, and provide monitoring tools for the surveillance of critical elements, as well as for R&D funding sources.

40|$|The {{economics}} of {{offshore wind energy}} are (currently) less favorable than for onshore wind energy {{and there is a}} strong need for significant cost reductions in order to become competitive with fossil fuel sources. As about 70 % part of the electricity cost is determined by the initial investment costs, we explored the ranges of possible cost reductions of offshore wind farms until 2020. The investment costs of offshore wind farms mainly consist of the wind turbine, the foundation, internal and external grid-connection and installation costs. For each of these components we analyzed technological developments and cost reduction trends in the offshore wind sector itself, but also in the <b>onshore</b> wind energy <b>sector,</b> the offshore oil and gas sector, and the high-voltage submarine transmission of electricity. Cost reduction trends where either quantified using the experience curve concept, or based on expert judgments. Main drivers for cost reduction appear to be design improvements and upscaling of wind turbines and the development and high utilization rates of purpose-built installation vessels. Other factors are the reduction of steel prices, technological development of HVDC converter stations, standardization of turbine and foundation design, and economies of scale for wind turbine and tripod foundation production. We conclude that under different growth scenarios investment costs of offshore wind farms may decline in the range of 25 - 40 % until 2020...|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} {{research on}} the hinge zone between northern Sicily and its Tyrrhenian off-shore has been carried out, by means of structural, seismological and statistical analyses. The main structural features of the area are represented by both NWSE to W–E striking right-lateral and N–S to NE-SW striking leftlateral fault systems, responsible of uplifting (restraining) and subsiding (releasing) zones. Within this hinge zone the seismicity is mainly located between 10 and 20 km of depth and clustered according to {{the orientation of the}} outcropping fault systems. The brittle strain partitioning related to a right-lateral simple shear zone has been reconstructed in the <b>onshore</b> <b>sector,</b> while in the offshore the structural setting has been inferred from morpho-bathymetric and geological maps of the southern Tyrrhenian basin. Moreover, in this latter zone, a new seismological study has been carried out on a part of 2002 seismic sequence (more than 600 events), using a database obtained by merging the CSI 1. 1 catalogue of INGV and new data recorded by 7 three-components stations of a temporary network installed by INGV. These seismic events, occurred between September and December 2002, have been relocated using an eight layered velocity model optimized for the southern Tyrrhenian. The focal mechanisms of 40 events have been determined. The Coulomb stress changes related to the main event have been also calculated. The general geometric characters of the whole set of investigated parameters well fit the simple shear deformational style reconstructed of the onshore study zone. Moreover, both focal mechanisms and principal stress components of about 100 events of 1992 - 1993 Pollina seismic swarm (Eastern Madonie Mts.) has been also carried out. The main focal mechanisms typologies and stress axis trends show a good agreement with the seismogenic volume anisotropy required by the seismotectonic model. This model is also supported by the high resolution tomographic results of the more shallow structures in the Pollina area, and by the study of two recent minor seismic sequences affecting the northern Sicilian sector (2010 - 2012) in the Caprileone area (Messina) and in the Isola delle Femmine offshore (west of Palermo). In this last sector high resolution morphobatimetric (multibeam) data highlight the presence of very young morphological features related to the ENE-WSW and NNW-SSE trending structural systems, probably responsible of the recent events...|$|E
40|$|The inner Northern Apennines (western Tuscany and Tyrrhenian basin) is {{characterized}} by a relatively thin continental crust (similar to 20 - 25 km), high heat flow (> 100 mW m(- 2)), and the presence of relevant tectonic elision of stratigraphic sequences, a setting known as Serie Ridotta. These features are normally ascribed to an extensional deformation that affected the back-arc area above the subducting Adria plate since the Early-Middle Miocene (similar to 16 Ma). However, various geophysical studies image the continental crust to be currently affected by W-dipping thrust faults (and associated basement uplifts) that have not been obliterated by this claimed long-lasting extensional process. These observations raise the question whether the thrusts are older or younger than the continental extension. To address this question we have reprocessed and interpreted the deep seismic reflection profile CROP 03 /c that crosses the <b>onshore</b> hinterland <b>sector,</b> and investigated the structural setting of some of the Late Miocene-Pliocene hinterland basins (Cinigiano-Baccinello, Siena-Radicofani, Tafone, Albegna and Radicondoli basins) that are situated at the front or in-between the basement uplifts. The analysis of field structures and commercial seismic profiles has allowed the recognition that both substratum and basins' infill have been intensely shortened. These findings and the architecture of the basins suggest that the latter developed under a contractional regime, which would have started around 8. 5 Ma with the onset of the continental sedimentation. This compressive stress state followed an earlier phase of continental extension that presumably started at similar to 16 Ma (with the blocking of the Corsica-Sardinia rotation), and thinned both the continental crust and sedimentary cover producing most of the Serie Ridotta. The main phases of basin shortening are bracketed between 7. 5 and 3. 5 Ma, and thus overlap with the increase in the exhumation rate of the metamorphic cores at similar to 6 - 4 Ma determined through thermochronological data. We therefore propose a correlation between the basin deformation and the activity of the nearby basement thrusts, which would have thus shortened a previously thinned continental crust. This chronology of deformation may suggest a geodynamic model in which the back-arc and hinterland sector of the Northern Apennines was recompressed during Late Miocene-Early Pliocene times. This evolution may be explained through different speculative scenarios involving a blockage of the subduction process, which may vary between end members of complete slab detachment and stalled subduction...|$|R

This research is conducted as there are several flaws or weaknesses in analyzing risks in the onshore plant. These weak points caused the risk analysis done previously seems relatively not effective since there is still accident happened in the plant. Therefore, this research was carried in order to search out what are the challenges that contribute to the existence of those flaws. This research was also done to determine the types of risks that have high possibilities to take place in undesirable future condition as well as investigating the types of risk analysis practiced by the personnel in analyzing these risks. The scope of this research is not over than the states of Pahang and Terengganu in the East Coast region of Malaysia. By referring to the previous academic sources, the term “risk” itself could brings either positive of negative definition. In the nature of risk, there are sequences of risk attitude when dealing with risk. The major types of risk attitude are risk averse, risk neutral and risk acceptance. The sources also discussed on the operations of the oil and gas plant as well as the types of risks identified that related to those operations. The most important parts of the information are the knowledge of the types of techniques used to analyze risk such as FMEA and HAZOP as well as the challenges that have been identified in conducting risk analysis in other industries generally. The type of sampling method used in this research was the simple random sampling which is the most suitable method to choose the targeted samples. By thorough discussions on the findings, there are five major types of risks exist in the onshore oil and gas plant which are fire, explosion, gas and equipment or machinery risks as well as maintenance risk. There are more than one type of risk analysis technique practiced in the plant such as the HAZID, HAZOP, FMEA, fault tree analysis and the HIRARC.

40|$|The Netherlands has {{the goal}} to have 14 % {{of the total}} energy {{production}} in 2020 generated in a sustainable way. In order to achieve this goal, onshore wind turbines {{need to have a}} combined capacity of 6000 MW and the offshore capacity needs to be increased to 4450 MW. The onshore wind industry is however quite saturated. Experts forecast that the onshore energy target will not be achieved {{due to the lack of}} space and heavy conflicts with local residents. Even if the target can be achieved, there is little to no space left for more large wind farms. Fully dedicating and shifting the wind energy development to the offshore sector is not without risk. Social cost benefit analyses show a wide array of different outcomes for the construction of large offshore wind farms. The net results range from losses of 5 billion euros to profits of 12 billion Euros. The Dutch government has decided to continue research and development of Dutch offshore wind projects. However, instead of completely focusing on the offshore <b>sector,</b> new potential <b>onshore</b> wind solutions could be investigated as well. The small wind turbine industry is also part of the <b>onshore</b> wind <b>sector</b> and has been well developed over the past decades. Over millions of small- and micro turbines are part of the onshore wind industry across the world. Small wind turbines are integrated into buildings or used as wind batteries. One new potential application could be to use the space along highways to install small wind turbines. Both the natural wind as the turbulence created by traffic could feed the generators to provide electricity to the grid or local applications such as street lighting or electric charging stations in the future. The report investigates the feasibility of this new concept by using the Prins Bernardweg Zaandam to Bolswarderbaan highway in the Netherlands as a virtual case study. The case study analyzes how and if the concept can be constructed and explores the impact of possible implementation. A combined technical-, stakeholder-and social cost benefit approach comprise the most essential components to make a careful assessment and recommendations. Multiple experts and stakeholders participated in interviews to provide expertise and validate information used in the analyses. The technical analysis showed that using the conventional vertical axis wind turbines from Windside grant accurate, reliable data to be used in the study and no inescapable technolocial barriers to turn up. An important unknown factor remains how the windside turbines affect the air resistance for ongoing traffic. Even though experts indicated that the effect is most likely in the favor of the traffic participants, if the project turns out to increase fuel usage the project cannot be launched. This was the main outcome from the stakeholder analysis, where both representatives from Rijkswaterstaat as the ANWB indicate a no go when drivers face additional travelling costs by driving on a highway filled with wind turbines. When this is not the case, the stakeholder analysis showed that there are no stakeholders who are likely to seriously threaten or influence the project in a negative way. All critical stakeholders can be convinced to support the project or stay neutral. These outcomes would have paved the way for the concept of wind turbines along the highway, if it was not for the social cost benefit analysis showing excessive negative social costs. Even in a best case scenario the net value of the project over the course of time touches a negative amount of over 700 million euros, with costs of over 3600 euro per Mwh. The preceeding answers the research question: To what extent can the concept of converting traffic turbulence and regular wind to useful energy be implemented in the Netherlands? The answer is that the concept can be fully implemented, but at as for now excessive costs. It should not be implemented yet on a medium- or large scale. Implementing the concept on a small scale could be worthwhile to investigate several matters. First, the effect of traffic passing wind turbines should be investigated. This knowledge can be used to inspire highly customized wind turbines which could potentially be cheaper and more efficient. The research is also needed to replace the assumptions made by the report with empirical evidence. Secondly, the potential reduction of both noise pollution and blinding effects by a row of wind turbines need to be researched. When these effects are substantially positive the use of wind turbines along highways might yet become interesting again. Third, the complete potential of wind capacity along all the highways in the Netherlands needs to be mapped. This provides an indication of the extra capacity that could be installed onshore using this method. In the future this capacity could be called upon when other options turn out to have a more negative net value, or the net value of this concept changes to an acceptable value. The last recommendation is to expand the concept to researching the installment of wind turbines along railroads.
