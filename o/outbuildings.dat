5|$|By 1924, {{there was}} {{distinct}} pressure on {{space in the}} halls of residence, and it was clear that more rooms were needed. The existing halls were full and so South Stoneham and South Hill were extended by covering their <b>outbuildings.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{property}} {{associated with}} the tavern contains three other buildings. A two-story garage, modeled after old carriage house/stable buildings, with a side-gable roof, gabled front dormer, and clapboard siding matching the tavern's in width and color, stands at {{the west end of}} the driveway, southwest of the tavern. It was built during the summer of 2003. Two small frame sheds, each a single-story structure of gable-front form with a saltbox or leanto roof, the south slopes shorter than the north ones, stand north of the garage behind the house. Little historical information on these is available. They appear to date from the early to mid-twentieth century but may be older. The south <b>outbuilding</b> includes a chimney vent. When the present owners acquired the property the <b>outbuilding</b> contained a tin sink. The present owners have heard that at one time the south <b>outbuilding</b> was a laundry/summer kitchen. Nothing is known about the north <b>outbuilding's</b> historic use. However, the north <b>outbuilding's</b> interior walls are covered with one-inch thick tightly-seamed boards and has a small chimney vent. This may indicate the <b>outbuilding</b> was used as a meat house/smokehouse at one time.|$|R

5|$|The castle {{was built}} {{to the east of}} the fourteenth-century town on a {{slightly}} raised location. The area enclosed within the castle's outer walls was about 2.8ha (7acres), but with <b>outbuildings,</b> other ancillary constructions and orchards, the total area has been estimated to be at least 8ha (20acres). The walls were constructed with rubble faced with ashlar, and even without their former polished facings the walls are about 3m (10ft) thick.|$|E

5|$|A Roman road {{passed through}} Oakhanger {{although}} no traces of it remain today.

The village contains four Grade II listed buildings, including Oakhanger Farmhouse and its three <b>outbuildings.</b> Oakhanger also has one pub, The Red Lion. St Mary Magdalene's Church was built in 1873 and the former Royal Air Force station, RAF Oakhanger, still retains its space domes in the village, although the station is now privately run.|$|E

5|$|During Gage's {{administration}} political tensions rose {{throughout the}} American colonies. As a result, Gage began withdrawing {{troops from the}} frontier to fortify urban centres like New York City and Boston. As the number of soldiers stationed in cities grew, {{the need to provide}} adequate food and housing for these troops became urgent. Parliament passed the Quartering Act of 1765, permitting British troops to be quartered in vacant houses, barns, and <b>outbuildings,</b> but not private residences.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2005 {{purchase}} of the original Colross site by a real estate development company, an archaeological excavation was undertaken between March and June that year {{at the behest of}} the city of Alexandria. Archaeologists uncovered an underground domed brick cistern and evidence of slave <b>outbuildings,</b> in addition to the foundations of the estate's peripheral walls and several ancillary structures. The excavation of the Colross site resulted in 79 condominium buyers abandoning their purchase agreements because of the delay in construction of a luxury Monarch Condominium project.|$|E
5|$|George Mason {{began to}} build his home, Gunston Hall, likely {{beginning}} in 1755. The exterior, typical of local buildings of that time, was probably based on architectural books sent from Britain to America {{for the use of}} local builders; one of these craftsmen, perhaps William Waite or James Wren, constructed Gunston Hall. Mason was proud of the gardens which still surround the house. There were <b>outbuildings,</b> including slave quarters, a schoolhouse, and kitchens, and beyond them four large plantations, forests, and the shops and other facilities that made Gunston Hall mostly self-sufficient.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the courthouse building, the public square contains several <b>outbuildings</b> and sites that are also historic in nature and considered contributing properties to the Oregon Commercial Historic District, including a sculpture by Lorado Taft and a cast-iron fountain. The courthouse joined the Register in 1981 and was included as a contributing property to the historic district in 2006. After initially joining the Register the structure underwent a careful restoration. The courthouse no longer serves as the primary judiciary center for the county; its successor is located directly across the street.|$|E
5|$|King Caesar’s grandchildren, {{the sons}} and daughters of Gershom B. Weston, then {{inherited}} the house which by that time was in disrepair. They soon sold it to Frederick Bradford Knapp, former Superintendent of Buildings at Harvard College, in 1886. Knapp established the Powder Point School for Boys, a preparatory school, and converted Ezra Weston’s farm into athletic fields and the <b>outbuildings</b> into classrooms and gymnasiums. The King Caesar House was designated as the headmaster's house. The Powder Point School for Boys ceased operation in 1926 and the Knapp family sold the property in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire was}} caused by a hunter's illegal fire that got out of control, and it was named for its {{proximity}} to the Rim of the World vista point, a scenic overlook on Highway 120 leading up to Yosemite.

A total of ten injuries from the wildfire were also reported, but no firefighters were killed during the suppression efforts which cost more than $127 million (2013 USD).|$|E
