5|$|Antbirds are monogamous, mate for life, {{and defend}} territories. They usually lay two {{eggs in a}} nest that is either {{suspended}} from branches or supported <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch,</b> stump, or mound on the ground. Both parents share the tasks of incubation and of brooding and feeding the nestlings. After fledging, each parent cares exclusively for one chick.|$|E
5|$|The {{great grey shrike}} is able {{to detect}} flying {{bumblebees}} up to 100 metres away; once captured, the sting is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles and wiping the abdomen <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch.</b> The European honey buzzard follows flying bees back to their nest, digs out the nest with its feet, and eats larvae, pupae and adults as it finds them.|$|E
5|$|The {{power station}} {{is on the}} A85 road, about 8 km or 5 miles west of Dalmally, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> of Loch Awe leading to the River Awe, which is the outflow from the loch, at its NW corner. There is a {{seasonally}} open Falls of Cruachan railway station nearby.|$|E

50|$|The {{false rue-anemone}} (Enemion biternatum) is similar. It has single flowers {{that are always}} white and usually have 5 sepals. They appear {{individually}} in leaf axils <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branching</b> stem.|$|R
50|$|Echium plantagineum is {{a winter}} annual plant growing to 20-60 cm tall, with rough, hairy, {{lanceolate}} leaves up to 14 cm long. The flowers are purple, 15-20 mm long, {{with all the}} stamens protruding, and borne <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branched</b> spike.|$|R
5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata is {{classified}} in the subgenus Amanita of the genus Amanita, according to the systems proposed by Cornelis Bas (1969), and Rolf Singer (1986). It was one of 49 Amanita species included in a 1998 molecular phylogenetic analysis intended to help clarify natural groups and phylogenetic relationships within the genus. In the cladogram, A.rubrovolvata is <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> next to a cluster of species including A.pantherina var. lutea, A.gemmata, A.farinosa, and A.sinensis. These results were comparable to those published in later phylogenetic analyses (1999, 2004, 2010) that have included A.rubrovolata {{as part of a}} larger dataset.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} 1929 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> from Wembley Park to Stanmore {{to serve a}} new housing {{development}} at Canons Park, with stations at Kingsbury and Canons Park (Edgware) (renamed Canons Park in 1933). The government again guaranteed finance, this time under the Development Loans Guarantees & Grants Act, the project also quadrupling the tracks from Wembley Park to Harrow. The line was electrified with automatic colour light signals controlled from a signal box at Wembley Park and opened on 9 December 1932.|$|E
5|$|Runcorn {{railway station}} is <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> of the West Coast Main Line and {{provides}} frequent {{services to the}} Liverpool Lime Street, Birmingham New Street, and London Euston stations. The A533 road passes through the town from the south, crossing the Runcorn Gap over the Silver Jubilee Bridge, the lowest bridge crossing of the River Mersey. The Manchester Ship Canal runs alongside the Runcorn bank of the River Mersey; the Bridgewater Canal terminates in the canal basin in the town centre, as the staircase of locks leading down to the ship canal was filled in many decades ago.|$|E

50|$|This species flowers {{during spring}} and early summer; the peak months are from October to December. The flowers are {{produced}} en-masse <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branched</b> raceme. The sepals, petals and column are usually white or cream, and the labellum is usually yellow, though white, apricot and orange coloured forms are sometimes encountered.|$|R

5|$|A 1996 {{molecular}} {{analysis of}} 38 Suillus species used the sequences of their internal transcribed spacers to infer phylogenetic relationships and clarify the taxonomy of the genus. The {{results indicate that}} S.spraguei is most closely related to S.decipiens. The species S.granulatus and S.placidus lie <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> sister to that containing S.spraguei. These results were corroborated and extended in later publications that assessed the relationships between Asian and eastern North American isolates of various Suillus, including S.spraguei. The analysis supported the hypothesis that Chinese and U.S. S.spraguei and S.decipiens were each other's closest relatives, and the clade that contained them could be divided into four distinct subgroups: S.decipiens, U.S. S.spraguei, China (Yunnan) S.spraguei, and China (Jilin) S.spraguei.|$|E
5|$|In July, {{the diet}} {{switches}} increasingly to fruit. The protein needed for egg-laying {{and for the}} chicks to grow is replaced by fruit sugar which helps the birds to fatten for migration. Aphids are still taken while they are available, since they often contain sugars from the plant sap on which they feed. Blackcaps eat {{a wide range of}} small fruit, and squeeze out any seeds <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> before consuming the pulp. This technique makes them an important propagator of mistletoe. The mistle thrush, which also favours that plant, is less beneficial since it tends to crush the seeds. Although any suitable fruit may be eaten, some have seasonal or local importance; elder makes up {{a large proportion of the}} diet of northern birds preparing for migration, and energy-rich olives and lentisc are favoured by blackcaps wintering in the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|Later inhabitation of Southcote was {{discovered}} at Anslow's Cottages {{south of the}} Kennet, where excavation suggests that a Bronze Age waterfront was made <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> of the river. A 1991 report by the Historic Buildings and Monuments Commission for England—now known as English Heritage—detailed the discovery of fragments of twined basketry at Anslow's Cottages, showing that eel or fish traps were used on the river near Southcote. Archaeological findings of timber structures adjacent to the trap suggest that it dated from the eight or ninth century. Later discoveries, made in the 1980s during gravel extraction in the area, also uncovered evidence of a landing stage or jetty on the river channel.|$|E

50|$|Calochortus tiburonensis is a {{perennial}} growing from a bulb to 10-60 cm in height {{with a single}} leaf. It produces anywhere from 2 to 7 erect flowers annually <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branching</b> stem. The ciliate, light yellow-green petals are streaked with purplish-brown. When mature, ovaries form capsule full of small, dark brown seeds.|$|R
5|$|The family uses {{a number}} of {{techniques}} to obtain prey. The majority of antbirds are arboreal, with most of those feeding in the understory, many in the middle story and some in the canopy. A few species feed in the leaf litter; for example, the wing-banded antbird forages in areas of dense leaf-litter. It does not use its feet to scratch the leaf litter, as do some other birds; instead it uses its long bill to turn over leaves rapidly (never picking them up). The antbirds that forage arboreally show {{a number of}} techniques and specialisations. Some species perch-glean, perching <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> watching for prey and snatching it by reaching forward, where others sally from a perch and snatch prey on the wing. In both cases birds will hop through the foliage or undergrowth and pause, scanning for prey, before pouncing or moving on. The time paused varies, although smaller species {{tend to be more}} active and pause for shorter times.|$|E
5|$|Until 19 August {{the weather}} was {{unsuitable}} for photography. Because Frances and Elsie insisted that the fairies would not show themselves if others were watching, Elsie's mother was persuaded to visit her sister's for tea, leaving the girls alone. In her absence the girls took several photographs, two of which appeared to show fairies. In the first, Frances and the Leaping Fairy, Frances is shown in profile with a winged fairy close by her nose. The second, Fairy offering Posy of Harebells to Elsie, shows a fairy either hovering or tiptoeing <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch,</b> and offering Elsie a flower. Two days later the girls took the last picture, Fairies and Their Sun-Bath.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} a {{courtship}} flight conducted above the trees. The pair fly on a strongly oscillating path with one bird ascending {{while the other}} is descending, both calling constantly. After display, the birds land <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branch</b> for a mating ritual which starts with locking bills, followed by the female hanging upside-down for a variable period of time, and then copulation while the male holds the female's neck. The flight and mating rituals have been recorded for three-coloured and red-throated parrotfinches, and may be typical for the genus. The nest is built with fresh grass blades, and is domed with a side entrance. It is always hidden in thick foliage, but can be at any height from the ground. The normal clutch is four spherical whitish eggs. Chicks are naked and have pinkish skin; the distinctive gape has blue nodular spots technically termed as papillae or tubercles at {{the upper and lower}} corners, and the yellow palate has a ring of five black spots. Most young estrildid finches beg for food with their wings held against the side, but juvenile parrotfinches lift the wing on the side away from the feeding parent. This behaviour may restrict competition for food from other nestlings.|$|E

40|$|Let M be {{a compact}} {{manifold}} and f a self-diffeomorphism of M. For a hyperbolic at-tractor Λ of f, Williams systematically reduced the attractor (Λ, f |Λ) to the inverse limit system (Σg, σg) for some Anosov endomorphism g <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>branched</b> manifold K. Furthermore, for expanding attractors, he even reduced topological conjugacy of attractors to shift equiva-lence of the corresponding maps g’s. Anosov endomorphisms represent models of hyperbolic attractors in this sense. However, {{we show that}} the later reduction does not hold for general hyperbolic attractors. In this dissertation, we will prove the following Theorem 1 Let a be a hyperbolic toral endomorphism. If f is sufficiently C 1 close to a, then f is shift equivalent to a {{if and only if}} f is topologically equivalent to a. As a corollary, we have Theorem 2 For general Anosov endomorphisms, inverse limit equivalence cannot imply shift equivalence.
