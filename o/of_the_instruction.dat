5|$|Final Fantasy IXs {{release was}} delayed {{to avoid a}} {{concurrent}} release with then rival Enix's Dragon Quest VII. On October 7, 2000, a demo day for the North American version of Final Fantasy IX {{was held at the}} Metreon in San Francisco, California. The first American release of the game was also at the Metreon; limited edition merchandise was included with the game, and fans cosplayed as Final Fantasy characters in celebration of the release. In Canada, a production error left copies of Final Fantasy IX without an English version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> manual, prompting Square to ship copies of the English manual to Canadian stores several days later.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Baxter {{heard that}} the New South Wales University of Technology {{was looking for a}} {{professor}} of chemical engineering. He applied, and was offered the job. Baxter and his family packed their belongings and sailed to Australia on the ocean liner Orcades, arriving in Sydney on 16 January 1950. They bought a house in Enfield, where Baxter would reside {{for the rest of his}} life. At the time the university was located in temporary accommodation on the grounds of the Sydney Technical College campus in Ultimo. Baxter became the head of a new School of Chemical Engineering that was created on his arrival, but he initially had only one full-time staff member as most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> was carried out by part-time staff. Although he had no previous teaching experience, he turned out to be a good, well-organised lecturer, and he worked closely with his first postgraduate students, whose research was into fields that Baxter had been involved with in England.|$|E

25|$|At the {{commencement}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction,</b> the teacher either prepares {{a plan for}} the autumn term's teaching in collaboration with the students or informs the students of such a plan. In the later phases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction,</b> the teacher and the students plan the work together. The teacher and the students regularly discuss the instruction given. Instruction in the individual classes is co-ordinated with a view to achieving a coherence between the different subjects and a suitable distribution of the student's workload.|$|E

25|$|Much {{emphasis}} {{was placed on}} education, as early training was regarded as the key to future success. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> was conducted in Guaraní, which was still the prevailing language of the country, but Spanish was also taught.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1962, {{the first attempt}} to use the {{notation}} to describe a complete computer system happened after Falkoff discussed with Dr. William C. Carter {{his work in the}} standardization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> set for the machines that later became the IBM System/360 family.|$|E
25|$|Each timing {{pulse in}} a {{subsequence}} could trigger up to 5 control pulses. The control pulses were the signals which did the actual work <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction,</b> {{such as reading}} {{the contents of a}} register onto the bus, or writing data from the bus into a register.|$|E
50|$|Under these circumstances, {{whenever}} <b>the</b> first <b>instruction</b> in a basic {{block is}} executed, <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> are necessarily executed exactly once, in order.|$|R

25|$|Unconditional {{branches}} {{update the}} program counter {{with a new}} address computed {{in the same way}} as conditional branches. They also save the address <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> following the unconditional branch to a register. There are two such instructions, and they differ only in the hints provided for the branch prediction hardware.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} jump instructions. These all perform the same operation, saving the address <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> {{following}} the jump, and providing the program counter {{with a new}} address from a register. They differ in the hints provided to the branch prediction hardware. The unused displacement field is used for this purpose.|$|E
25|$|The college-operated Primary Schools {{could no}} longer meet the Secondary School needs; therefore, {{additional}} Primary Schools under Navy operation were begun in late 1943. These were set up as full Navy bases. A reservoir of military personnel trained in the ETP was now available, so all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> was by Petty Officers or Marine Sergeants.|$|E

25|$|The later Pentium MMX {{also added}} the MMX {{instruction}} set, a basic integer SIMD instruction set extension marketed {{for use in}} multimedia applications. MMX {{could not be used}} simultaneously with the x87 FPU instructions because the registers were reused (to allow for fast context switches). More important enhancements were the doubling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> and data cache sizes and a few microarchitectural changes for better performance.|$|E
25|$|After {{the move}} to Maxwell, the {{practice}} of requiring students to fly actual missions as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> process was discontinued for safety reasons. Plans for a composite school group were suspended by the Chief of the Air Corps because of a service-wide shortage of personnel and aircraft, and attempts to have demonstrations by existing combat units were mostly unsatisfactory. The demonstration group was not authorized until August 1939 and was utilized {{for less than a}} year before classes were suspended.|$|E
25|$|The Block II AGC {{also has}} the mysterious and poorly {{documented}} EDRUPT instruction (the name may be a contraction of Ed's Interrupt, after Ed Smally, the programmer who requested it) which is used a total of once in the Apollo software: in the Digital Autopilot of the Lunar Module. At this time, while the general operation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> is understood, the precise details are still hazy, and it {{is believed to be}} responsible for problems emulating the LEM AGC Luminary software.|$|E

25|$|INDEX: Add {{the data}} {{retrieved}} at the address {{specified by the}} instruction to the next instruction. INDEX {{can be used to}} add or subtract an index value to the base address specified by the operand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> that follows INDEX. This method is used to implement arrays and table look-ups; since the addition was done on both whole words, it was also used to modify the op. code in a following (extracode) instruction, and on rare occasions both functions at once.|$|E
25|$|Conditional {{branches}} {{test whether}} the {{least significant bit}} of a register is set or clear, or compare a register as a signed quadword to zero, and branch if the specified condition is true. The conditions available for comparing a register to zero are equality, inequality, less than, {{less than or equal}} to, greater than or equal to, and greater than. The new address is computed by longword aligning and sign extending the 21-bit displacement and adding it to the address <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> following the conditional branch.|$|E
25|$|She {{was allowed}} to leave the formal school system {{at a young age}} and {{subsequently}} spent several winters in Paris studying art. In 1896, Heaton began to study at the Art Students' League, on West 57th Street in New York City. The League was established 20 years earlier by strong-minded young men in rebellion from the conservative nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruction</b> at the National Academy of Design. By the time that Mary entered, the school was booming, with over 1100 pupils studying in sex-segregated day and evening classes, studying sketch art, sculpture, and painting.|$|E
50|$|The {{execution}} process {{carries out}} <b>the</b> <b>instructions</b> {{in a computer}} program. <b>Instructions</b> express <b>the</b> computations performed by the computer.
