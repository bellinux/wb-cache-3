5|$|At {{the start}} of the race, all the cars lined up on the grid per FIA race procedure. As Charlie Whiting signalled the green light to start the {{formation}} lap, a full field of twenty cars set off as normal for a single lap before forming the starting grid. At the banked Turn 13, the entrance to the pit lane (and the turn that was the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controversy),</b> all teams that ran Michelin tyres returned to their pits, leaving just six cars from the three Bridgestone teams (Ferrari, Jordan, and Minardi) to start the race.|$|E
5|$|Battersea Council {{grew tired}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controversy.</b> A new Conservative council {{was elected in}} November 1909 amid talk of {{removing}} the statue. There were protests in support of it, and the 500-strong Brown Dog memorial defence committee was established. Twenty thousand people signed a petition, and 1,500 attended a rally in February 1910 addressed by Lind af Hageby, Charlotte Despard and Liberal MP George Greenwood. There were more demonstrations in central London and speeches in Hyde Park, with supporters wearing masks of dogs.|$|E
5|$|Clinton {{controversially}} issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on {{his last}} day in office on January 20, 2001. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother, Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons. Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican James Comey, who found no wrongdoing on Clinton's part. Some of Clinton's pardons remain a point of controversy.|$|E

After an enlarged edition of the book was published as Lives of Game Animals, Seton was ironically awarded the Burroughs Medal in 1927, a prize named after the venerable naturalist who had once so criticized Seton's work.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, Pastafarians in Crossville, Tennessee, were {{permitted}} to place a Flying Spaghetti Monster statue in a free speech zone on the courthouse lawn, and proceeded to do so. The display gained national interest on blogs and online news sites and was even covered by Rolling Stone magazine. It was later removed from the premises, {{along with all the}} other long-term statues, as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> over the statue. In December 2011, Pastafarianism was one of the multiple denominations given equal access to placing holiday displays on the Loudoun County courthouse lawn, in Leesburg, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Old Court {{chief justice}} John Boyle {{resigned}} {{to accept a}} federal judgeship. The General Assembly decided to speed the reconciliation of the two sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> by naming New Court partisan George Bibb as Boyle's replacement. Old Court justices Mills and Owsley resigned, hoping to clarify the situation further. They were immediately reappointed, but the Senate refused to confirm their appointments. The governor appointed George Robertson and Joseph R. Underwood, who were both confirmed by the Senate.|$|E

5|$|The Fritz Pollard Alliance, a {{non-profit}} organization closely allied with the NFL on civil rights issues, announced its support of a name change in 2015 after repeated attempts {{to discuss the issue}} with the team owner and representatives. An attorney for the Alliance, N.

5|$|The book {{is divided}} into 12 chapters, with a prologue, an epilogue, {{acknowledgments}} and sources. Chapters deal with various topics, including {{an overview of the}} biggest oil producing countries, an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> over Talisman Energy's involvement in Sudan, a critical analysis of some ethical funds, a case about inconsistencies in Greenpeace activism, a rebuke of the cancer controversy in Fort Chipewyan, the implication of Middle-Eastern regimes in the anti-Oil sands movement, and a critical analysis of the green jobs arguments.|$|E
5|$|The footage shows Jamal and Muhammad {{crouching}} {{behind the}} cylinder, the child screaming {{and the father}} shielding him. Jamal appears to shout something {{in the direction of}} the cameraman, then waves and shouts {{in the direction of the}} Israeli outpost. There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes out of focus. When the gunfire subsides, Jamal is sitting upright and injured and Muhammad is lying over his legs. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face. This cut became the basis of much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> over the film.|$|E

5|$|The {{reasons for}} {{piercing}} or not piercing are varied. Some people pierce for religious or spiritual reasons, while others pierce for self-expression, for aesthetic value, for sexual pleasure, {{to conform to}} their culture or to rebel against it. Some forms of piercing remain controversial, particularly when applied to youth. The display or placement of piercings have been restricted by schools, employers and religious groups. In spite <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controversy,</b> some people have practiced extreme forms of body piercing, with Guinness bestowing World Records on individuals with hundreds and even thousands of permanent and temporary piercings.|$|E
5|$|This working {{definition}} {{has since}} been widely used by astronomers when publishing discoveries of exoplanets in academic journals. Although temporary, it remains an effective working definition until a more permanent one is formally adopted. It {{does not address the}} dispute over the lower mass limit, and so it steered clear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> regarding objects within the Solar System. This definition also makes no comment on the planetary status of objects orbiting brown dwarfs, such as 2M1207b.|$|E
5|$|While Darwinian {{evolution}} {{never became}} an issue for northern Presbyterians as most accommodated themselves {{to some form of}} theistic evolution, the new discipline of biblical interpretation known as higher criticism would become highly controversial. Utilizing comparative linguistics, archaeology, and literary analysis, German proponents of high criticism, such as Julius Wellhausen and David Friedrich Strauss, began questioning long-held assumptions about the Bible. At the forefront <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> in the PCUSA was Charles A. Briggs, a professor at PCUSA's Union Theological Seminary in New York.|$|E

5|$|After 1999, {{the only}} member of the Keating Five {{remaining}} in the U.S. Senate was John McCain, who had an easier time gaining re-election in 1992 than he anticipated. He survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press. McCain subsequently ran for president in 2000 and became the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. During the 2000s, several retrospective accounts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> reiterated the contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target. Glenn's inclusion in the investigation has been attributed to Republicans who were angered by the inclusion of McCain, as well as committee members who thought that dropping Glenn (and McCain) would make it look bad for the remaining three Democratic Senators.|$|E
5|$|After {{participating}} in Canada's Olympic summer camp before the season, Iginla again set new personal highs in 2001–02 when he registered 52goals and 96points. This season elevated Iginla to superstar status. He earned the Art Ross and Maurice Richard trophies as the NHL's leading point and goal scorer, respectively. He was also awarded the Lester B. Pearson Award as the league's {{most valuable player}} as voted by his peers, and was a nominee for both the Hart Memorial Trophy and the King Clancy Memorial Trophy. The Hart Trophy voting proved to be controversial: Iginla tied Canadiens goaltender José Théodore in voting points, but received fewer first place votes than Théodore. However, one voter, rumoured to be from Quebec—Théodore and the Canadiens' home province—inexplicably left Iginla off his ballot. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controversy</b> that followed, the Professional Hockey Writers Association changed the rules on how its members voted for the award to prevent a recurrence.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Eric Morley {{organized}} the Festival Bikini Contest, a beauty contest and swimwear advertising opportunity at that year's Festival of Britain. The press, welcoming the spectacle, {{referred to it}} as Miss World, a name Morley registered as a trademark. The winner was Kiki Håkansson of Sweden, who was crowned in a bikini. After the crowning, Håkansson was condemned by Pope Pius XII, while Spain and Ireland threatened to withdraw from the pageant. In 1952, bikinis were banned from the pageant and replaced by evening gowns. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>controversy,</b> the bikini was explicitly banned from many other beauty pageants worldwide. Though some regarded the bikini and beauty contests as bringing freedom to women, they were opposed by some feminists as well as religious and cultural groups who objected to the degree of exposure of the female body.|$|E
