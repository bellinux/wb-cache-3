40|$|In {{response}} to sanitary crisis, risk management {{has become a}} central issue for food producers and distributors in Europe. Organisational responses to sanitary risks usually implying traceability have been conceived by firms. One of the main tasks here is to deal with coordination of the different operators of a food chain. The European Union has developed a regulatory framework with the Regulation 178 / 2002. This regulation sets a mandatory traceability considered as a risk management tool. Traceability that was considered as a private initiative has therefore become an obligation with this regulation. This paper tries to evaluate if {{the problem of the}} operators coordination on specific traceability practices that any private organisational of a food chain had to face is solved with the strict application of the Regulation 178 / 2002. For that, the analysis characterises the mandatory traceability and the <b>operators</b> <b>responsibilities</b> set by the regulation. The coordination task and the problem of trust that it contains is then described. The analysis shows the limits of the mandatory traceability in this context and suggests a solution. traceability, risk management, food safety, Agribusiness, Industrial Organization, I 18, K 32, Q 18.,...|$|E

A nuclear accident like the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster would have dire economic consequences in heavily populated India as did the 1984 Union Carbide Bhopal disaster, the world's worst industrial disaster, covered extensively in Dominique Lapierre's 2009 prize winning book Five Past Midnight in Bhopal.|$|R

DERs can provide services to both Distribution System Operators (DSOs) and Transmission System Operators (TSOs). The conventional fit-and-forget approach that many DSOs follow may need to change to perform more active operation of the system {{as well as new}} roles. The roles of TSOs and DSOs will be evolving in kind as more DERs start to change load and generation patterns in distribution grids. With increasing penetration of DERs, the coordination between system operators will expand, in terms of information exchange, monitoring and analytic capabilities, computation of prices of electricity services, forecasting, scheduling and activation of resources, as well as system <b>operator</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> DSOs and TSOs must be able to monitor and engage resources as well as study and share information in a timely manner to enable efficient markets and reliable system operations. This paper explores the current and future relationship between the TSO and DSO with a focus on the European and US liberalized power sectors. The coordination between TSOs and DSOs is of utmost importance for the grid to obtain the full value from services provided by DERs such as, but not limited to, firm capacity, congestion relief, loss reduction, reactive power, voltage control and frequency reserves. Examples and recommendations for future coordination between the TSO and DSO will be examined and presented, as well as new interactions with market parties, such as DERs aggregators or directly with DERs owners. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In this study, a {{laboratory}} experiment {{was designed to}} investigate {{the relationship between the}} pupil dilation and multitasking performance by using eye and head integrated human-in-the-loop (HITL) system. Thirty-six university students joined in this study as participants, and they were asked to do several different tasks simultaneously and give correct response in time according to the dynamic system change. The primary task domain is a process gauge monitoring task, which simulates <b>operator</b> <b>responsibilities</b> in the control room of oil and gas refinery plants. Two different operation interfaces were designed for the primary task to identify the interface influence on human multitasking performance. The secondary task was Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB), which is consisted of three tasks, system monitoring, target tracking, and dynamic resource management. During the experiment, participants need to keep moving their eye and head to switch among four tasks; an eye-head integrated tracking system was introduced to continuously record participants' pupil change and visual scan path during the entire experiment time. Also, participants experienced two levels of complexity (low and high) scenarios during the experiment. NASA-TLX was applied to measure participants' workload when facing to the different operation interface and complexity scenarios. For exploring the pattern of pupil changes, the fractal dimension analysis was used as a tool to measure if their pupil dilations have any self-similar features in different condition. Analysis of the data revealed overall multitasking performance was highest in low complexity by using Visual Thesaurus overview display. Moreover, a positive correlation was found between the performance and fractal dimension of pupil dilation. This finding suggested eye-tracking data could be a potential valid source to identify the performance level in the multitasking environment...|$|R

40|$|Human {{activities}} {{have increased in}} such a way that there now exists the danger that some global balances will be disturbed. As a result, there is today a widespread effort to get precise knowledge about these balances themselves as well as about the consequences of possible disturbances in these balances. Because of their magnitude, these problems are inter-related with other problems. Additionally, effects which were considered earlier to be side effects become important. All this means that for the treatment of these problems a systems approach seems necessary. This paper recommends use of the general concept of material accountability for the analysis and treatment of these problems. This has already been proposed by different groups. The reason it is emphasized here is that the material accountability concept has proven extremely valuable in the establishment of the IAEA safeguards system for nuclear material in the peaceful nuclear industry. It is especially the organization of this system in the plant <b>operator's</b> <b>responsibility</b> (generation and reporting of source data for material balance) and in the safeguards authority's responsibility (verification of these data by means of independent measurements) which allowed the acceptance of this system on a broad international scale and which GROSSO MODO could serve as an example for any future global monitoring system. In the first part of this paper, examples for balances existing in nature are given: oxygen, carbon dioxide, radiation balance of the earth atmosphere system. Models for these balances and their disturbances as well as the respective measurements are reported. In the second part we have tried to explain why the treatment of these problems necessarily leads into the field of systems analysis. Special reference is made to the problems outlined in this paper. As an example for this kind of approach and for an existing global control system, the IAEA safeguards system and the mathematical models developed in the course of establishing that system are sketched in the third part. In the fourth part, the economic implications of material accountability are described using the input-output approach; for the example of sulphur it is demonstrated in which way the consequences of constraints [...] e. g. in the form of emission standards [...] can be analyzed. The paper ends with a schematic representation of the complex interrelations between the basic concepts: material accountability, verification by means of measurements, and economic implications...|$|R
