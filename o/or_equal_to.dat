Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b.|$|E

40|$|A brief outline {{about the}} theory of {{planetary}} waves is given and a review of space-time analysis, mainly at the 500 mbar pressure level, is presented. This analysis gives evidence that broad spectral bands of two types of waves exist within the troposphere: ultralong waves with zonal wave numbers M <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 4 and periods tau <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 5 days, propagating mainly to the west, and synoptic scale waves with M <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 3 and tau <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> <b>to</b> 10 days, propagating mainly to the east. These waves are generated by internal turbulent processes within the atmosphere and are quasi-persistent with lifetimes of several periods. It is shown that solar activity cannot generate planetary waves of significant amplitudes, and that the observed 'Sun-weather effects' can be interpreted {{within the framework of}} these internally generated planetary waves without any trigger mechanism from outside the atmosphere. It is suggested that a better knowledge of these persistent ultralong waves may help to improve long range weather forecasts...|$|R
5|$|It {{is unclear}} whether new {{elements}} will continue {{the pattern of the}} current periodic table as period 8, or require further adaptations or adjustments. Seaborg expected the eighth period to follow the previously established pattern exactly, so that it would include a two-element s-block for elements 119 and 120, a new g-block for the next 18 elements, and 30 additional elements continuing the current f-, d-, and p-blocks, culminating in element 168, the next noble gas. More recently, physicists such as Pekka Pyykkö have theorized that these additional elements do not follow the Madelung rule, which predicts how electron shells are filled and thus affects the appearance of the present periodic table.
