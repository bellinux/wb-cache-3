After two weeks Lennon asked {{to sleep in a}} separate room, saying he could only meditate when he was alone, but walked down to the local post office every morning to see if he had received a telegram from Ono, who sent one almost daily. Cynthia found out about these secretive trips much later, saying: [...] "I had thought our magical interlude with the Maharishi would be the making <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>marriage</b> – but in reality it just presaged the end". Paul Saltzman later published a book of photographs, The Beatles in Rishikesh, showing Lennon deep in thought, and Cynthia's confused expression. Despite the alienation from Lennon, she later spoke about her time there, saying: [...] "I loved being away from the fans, hordes of people, deadlines, demands and flashing cameras".|$|E

"I {{think the}} {{explanation}} is," [...] replied the Minor Poet, [...] "that as regards, let us say, {{the most natural}} business <b>of</b> <b>our</b> life, <b>marriage,</b> <b>our</b> natural instincts alone are brought into play. Marriage--clothe the naked fact in what flowers of rhetoric we will- -has {{to do with the}} purely animal part <b>of</b> <b>our</b> being. The man is drawn towards it by his primeval desires; the woman by her inborn craving towards motherhood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why is it," [...] sighed the Philosopher, [...] "that in {{the most}} serious {{business}} <b>of</b> <b>our</b> life, <b>marriage,</b> serious considerations count for next to nothing? A dimpled chin can, and often does, secure for a girl the best of husbands; while virtue and understanding combined cannot be relied upon to obtain her {{even one of the}} worst." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite right, Sir Patrick, {{as to the}} facts. I own, however, {{that your}} {{commentary}} on them surprises me. I have the highest opinion <b>of</b> <b>our</b> Scottish <b>marriage</b> law. A man who has betrayed a woman under a promise of marriage is forced by that law (in the interests of public morality) to acknowledge her as his wife." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 2011, {{the couple}} celebrated their 45th anniversary. Later, Parton said, [...] "We're really proud <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>marriage.</b> It's the first {{for both of}} us. And the last." ...|$|E
2500|$|John McCain {{would later}} say, [...] "My marriage's {{collapse}} was attributable {{to my own}} selfishness and immaturity more {{than it was to}} Vietnam, and I cannot escape blame by pointing a finger at the war. The blame was entirely mine." [...] Carol McCain later said, [...] "The breakup <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>marriage</b> was not caused by my accident or Vietnam or any of those things. I don't know that it might not have happened if John had never been gone. I attribute it more to John turning 40 and wanting to be 25 again than I do to anything else." [...] McCain's biographer Robert Timberg believes that [...] "Vietnam did play a part, perhaps not the major part, but more than a walk-on." [...] According to Carol, her husband's five-year captivity in Vietnam had left him wanting to [...] "make up for lost time", and John put it this way: [...] "I had changed, she had changed ... People who have been apart that much change." [...] Ross Perot later said, [...] "After he came home, he walked with a limp, she [...] walked with a limp. So he threw her over for a poster girl with big money from Arizona [...] and the rest is history." ...|$|E

[...] Unless there is a particularly good reason, I hope that you will not abandon him. [...] As to my Zhangsun clan, many of them enjoy high salaries and high positions on account <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>marriage,</b> not because of their great virtues, and therefore they can crumble easily. [...] In order to preserve the Zhangsuns, I hope that you will not put them in powerful positions, and that they would be satisfied with seeing you at imperial gatherings the first and 15th day of each month. [...] During my lifetime, I made no contributions to the people, and I should not harm them in my death. [...] I hope that you will not build a tomb to cause the people to labor and the empire to waste resources. [...] Make a hill my tomb, and only use brick or wooden implements in the tomb. [...] I hope that Your Imperial Majesty will continue to be close to honest men and stay away from those lacking virtues; that you will accept faithful words and reject wicked flattery; that you will decrease labor and stop hunting. [...] Even as I go into the underworld, if these things happen, I will have no regrets. [...] It is not necessary to summon the sons and daughters back here; if I see them mourn and cry, I will only be saddened.|$|E

60|$|I {{have told}} how I loved Margaret and how I came to marry her. Perhaps already unintentionally I have {{indicated}} the quality <b>of</b> the injustice <b>our</b> <b>marriage</b> did us both. There was no kindred {{between us and}} no understanding. We were drawn to one another by the unlikeness <b>of</b> <b>our</b> quality, by the things we misunderstood in each other. I know a score of couples who have married in that fashion.|$|R
60|$|I {{had heard}} of it, at the time <b>of</b> <b>our</b> betrothal--when the <b>marriage</b> {{settlement}} was in preparation. The mother and daughter had each a little income of a few hundreds a year. The exact amount had escaped my memory.|$|R

60|$|So {{we talked}} {{as well as}} my sufferings would allow. We talked of how we first had met, of how Otomie had been vowed to me as the wife of Tezcat, Soul of the World, of that day when we had lain side by side upon the stone <b>of</b> sacrifice, <b>of</b> <b>our</b> true <b>marriage</b> thereafter, <b>of</b> the siege of Tenoctitlan and the death <b>of</b> <b>our</b> first-born.

60|$|W.A.--Why, I {{first told}} her the nature <b>of</b> <b>our</b> laws about <b>marriage,</b> and what the reasons were {{that men and women}} were obliged to enter into such {{compacts}} as it was neither in the power of one nor other to break; that otherwise, order and justice could not be maintained, and men would run from their wives, and abandon their children, mix confusedly with one another, and neither families be kept entire, nor inheritances be settled by legal descent.|$|R

I cannot ask you today to share with me this struggle, but it is my right on you not to stop me from jihad in the way of Allah. Moreover, you should not ask me about my activities with other Mujahideen, and let trust be full between us. A full trust between a man and a woman, a woman who, at the age of 18, gave her full life to Allah and Da'wah.

"Emilie, in marrying the Count de Laville, made a match {{somewhat}} {{above her}} own rank; for the Lavilles were a wealthier {{and more powerful}} family than that of Charles de Moulins, her father. On the other hand, I was, although of good birth, yet inferior in consideration to De Moulins, although my lands were broader than his. Consequently we saw little <b>of</b> Emilie, after <b>our</b> <b>marriage.</b> Therefore my being with Marie would, in no way, increase {{the warmth of the}} welcome that she and Philip will receive. I may say that the estrangement was, perhaps, more my fault than that of the Lavilles. I chose to fancy there was a coolness on their part, which probably existed only in my imagination. Moreover, shortly after my marriage the religious troubles grew serious; and we were all too much absorbed in our own perils, and those <b>of</b> <b>our</b> poorer neighbours, to think of travelling about, or of having family gatherings.|$|R
40|$|After the 1970 - 71 school year, my {{wife and}} I were weary of {{teaching}} as {{are so many other}} teachers in June, and so we. sought relaxation by traveling to Fairbanks, Alaska, in our Toyota. The route taken by the Davidsons in this novel duplicates that route. Observations of the landscape are meant to be accurate although colored by my moods. In characterization, however, most is fiction. Each character is drawn from a composite. He or she is based on observations taken from many people I have known who have had some function or occupation in common. For example, the personalities of the girls 2 ̆ 7 physical education teachers are based on features I have observed in both male and female physical education teachers but not in any one in particular. In addition, the relationship between John and Kris is not a picture <b>of</b> how <b>our</b> <b>marriage</b> was, but <b>of</b> how it might be for any young couple who meet after growing up in both physically and emotionally divergent worlds...|$|R
