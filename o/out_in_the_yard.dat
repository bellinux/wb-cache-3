25|$|It was {{a period}} of {{violence}} from 1978. In March 1979 the Olinga home was robbed though the temple was undisturbed and there was a suspicious accident where Olinga's car was rammed and forced down a hill by a troop transport vehicle, where he was robbed and left for dead, and Olinga's son George was disappeared for a week by soldiers of Amin. Death threats perhaps simply because of his prominence came to Olinga from his home town. Meanwhile, after President Amin fled in April the religion began to re-organize - there was the re-opening of the Bahá'í House of Worship again, and the beginning of reforming the national assembly in August. Neighbors and a garden servant boy bore witness mostly by hearing events of the execution of the Olinga family. On the evening of Sunday, September 16, 1979, the birthday of one of Olinga's daughters and planned as a day of a family reunion of which a few could not arrive in time, after 8pm local time five soldiers entered Olinga's home while one stood guard at the household gate and killed Olinga, his wife, and three of their five children. Trails of blood went from the kitchen {{to the back of the}} house and one of the children had been hurt and roughly bandaged before the family was executed. Enoch himself was killed <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> where he had been heard weeping after perhaps witnessing his dead family in the very same house he had joined the religion in. The news was conveyed initially by the garden servant to a member of the national committee that had been appointed and then to a 79-year-old pioneer, Claire Gung, who called internationally. Ultimately news reached the Universal House of Justice while it sat in session on the 17th. All the dead were buried in the Bahá'í cemetery on the temple grounds on the 25th while civil war and terrorism continued. The funeral included hundreds of Bahá'ís who could make the trip and several members of the government of Uganda.|$|E
2500|$|Domovye are masculine, {{typically}} small, bearded, {{and sometimes}} covered in hair all over. According to some traditions, domovye {{take on the}} appearance of current or former owners of the house, sometimes with tails or little horns. This belief is commonly held to be a remnant of the pre-Christian cult of ancestors which is also reflected {{in some of the}} titles of the domovoi (e.g., dedko, dedushka [...] "grandfather"). There are tales of neighbors seeing the master of the house <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>yard</b> while in fact the real master was asleep in bed. It has also been said that domovye can take on the appearance of cats or dogs. The domovoi is more often heard than seen and his voice is said to be hollow and harsh.|$|E
2500|$|On 23February 1876, {{a private}} in the Royal Marines serving on board Endymion was court-martialled {{on a charge}} of insubordination; he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years' imprisonment.

This caused two windows to fall out of a building in Scale Lane, Hull, injuring two passers-by. On 14 August, a fire broke out at a timber yard in Hull. Crewmen from , Endymion and [...] assisted the Hull police in fighting the fire. Nine days later, crewmen from Endymion gave assistance at another fire at a timber yard in Drypool. John Moresby took command of Endymion on 29September 1876.|$|E

5000|$|The sodium cooled system gave other unique {{attributes}} to the U.S. Navy vessel: the phrase [...] "Blue Haze" [...] was {{often associated with}} the boat as Cherenkov radiation, a blue glow visible on a dark night outboard of <b>the</b> reactor compartment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea water surrounding the hull caused by the decay of radioactive sodium-24 (24Na) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary system over essentially its first half-life (15 hrs). This harmless glow from a secondary effect made for many a dockside conversation. There was only one coolant leak ever noted, and that was during fitting <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>yards.</b> However <b>the</b> superheaters suffered from tube sheet welding cracks which allowed high pressure steam to leak into the low pressure primary system and react with the sodium to form sodium hydroxide and H2 (potentially explosive). Hydrogen also has a small capture cross section which formed 3H as a free gas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> primary system. This complicated system operation since 3H is radioactive, would mix with the H2 from Na-H2O reaction {{and had to be}} contained.|$|R
