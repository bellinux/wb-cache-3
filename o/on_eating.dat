All animal products, including eggs and dairy products (but not fish), were generally prohibited during Lent and fast. Additionally, it was customary for all citizens to fast prior to taking the Eucharist. These fasts were occasionally for a full day and required total abstinence.|$|E

25|$|Proteins are {{essential}} food substances, contained in {{foods such as}} vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, meat, fish, poultry, dairy products and eggs. With reduced ability to eat a large volume of food, gastric bypass patients must focus <b>on</b> <b>eating</b> their protein requirements first, and with each meal. In some cases, surgeons may recommend use of a liquid protein supplement. Powdered protein supplements added to smoothies or any food {{can be an important}} part of the post-op diet.|$|E
25|$|Plants make {{cholesterol}} in {{very small}} amounts. Plants manufacture phytosterols (substances chemically similar to cholesterol), which {{can compete with}} cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption. When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, in place of cholesterol, they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the GI tract, an important protective mechanism. The intake of naturally occurring phytosterols, which encompass plant sterols and stanols, ranges between ~200–300mg/day depending <b>on</b> <b>eating</b> habits. Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets have been produced yielding upwards of 700mg/day.|$|E

25|$|According to Canon Law, Roman Catholics are {{required}} to abstain from meat (defined as all animal flesh excluding water animals) on Ash Wednesday and all Fridays of Lent including Good Friday. Canon Law also obliges Catholics to abstain from meat on the Fridays of the year outside of Lent (excluding certain holy days) unless, {{with the permission of}} the local conference of bishops, another penitential act is substituted. The restrictions <b>on</b> <b>eating</b> meat on these days is solely as an act of penance and not because of a religious objection to eating meat.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{law of the}} Urapmin {{was characterized}} by many rules about religious behavior and an elaborate taboo system, focused especially <b>on</b> <b>eating</b> and land use, as well as regulating what could be touched and who could know what information. According to Urapmin tradition, Afek gave ownership of the wild (sep) to the motobil (nature spirits), who themselves gave ownership of the villages (abiip) to humans. Natural resources, including streams, large trees, hunting ground, and game {{were believed to be}} owned by the motobil, and humans could only use what they were given permission to respectfully.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the commercially}} {{available}} prescription diabetes foods {{are high in}} fiber, complex carbohydrates, and have proven therapeutic results. Of primary concern is getting or keeping the animal eating, as use of the prescribed amount of insulin is dependent <b>on</b> <b>eating</b> full meals. When no meal is eaten, {{there is still a}} need for a basal dosage of insulin, which supplies the body's needs without taking food into consideration. Eating a partial meal means a reduction in insulin dose. Basal and reduced insulin dose information should be part of initial doctorclient diabetes discussions in case of need.|$|E

25|$|Newton's Hertford was a {{relatively}} spartan College, having received no real endowment. Meals were simple and cheap, and the principal insisted <b>on</b> <b>eating</b> the same as everyone else. Students were expected to work hard, and, where Newton found the University's education lacking, he supplemented it with disputations within the College. Newton allowed gentlemen-commoners to matriculate at the College, but they paid double fees for the same accommodation and food as the others. They were originally allowed to wear their coloured gowns and tufted caps, but Newton eventually made them wear the ordinary black gown. Thus, many a well-to-do family sent their sons to Hertford College to instil in them some disciplined education, unlike the privileged wining and dining had by gentlemen-commoners in other colleges.|$|E
25|$|Care {{should be}} taken when {{consuming}} oysters. Purists insist <b>on</b> <b>eating</b> them raw, with no dressing save perhaps lemon juice, vinegar (most commonly shallot vinegar), or cocktail sauce. Upscale restaurants pair raw oysters with a home-made Mignonette sauce, which consists primarily of fresh chopped shallot, mixed peppercorn, dry white wine and lemon juice or sherry vinegar. Like fine wine, raw oysters have complex flavors that vary greatly among varieties and regions: salty, briny, buttery, metallic, or even fruity. The texture is soft and fleshy, but crisp on the palate. North American varieties include: Kumamoto and Yaquina Bay from Oregon, Duxbury and Wellfleet from Massachusetts, Malpeque from Prince Edward Island, Canada, Blue Point from Long Island, New York, Pemaquid from Maine, and Cape May oysters from New Jersey. Variations in water salinity, alkalinity, and mineral/nutritional content influence their flavor profile.|$|E
25|$|The school {{continues}} to maintain strong discipline with a strict {{set of rules}} and regulations. Disciplinary measures {{are based on the}} Raffles Online Discipline system, introduced in 2011 and adapted from the Year 5 - 6 Section. Prior to the present system, student records were maintained based on a demerit point system, with Reformative Work Order and detention sessions for repeat offenders. These systems are primarily targeted at petty offences. Current school rules include prohibitions <b>on</b> <b>eating</b> and possessing sweetened drinks outside the canteen, physical activity in school uniform (as opposed to PE attire), and changing in class. The discipline framework is administered by the Discipline Master, in collaboration with the RIPB, for Year 1-4 students, and the Assistant Department Head (ADH) for Discipline for Year 5-6 students. For more serious offences, all male students are liable to receive corporal punishment in the form of caning if necessary.|$|E

500|$|Timothy Jay argues, citing Leach, {{that the}} use of animal epithets as insults is partly down to taboos <b>on</b> <b>eating</b> pets or {{unfamiliar}} wild animals, and partly down to our stereotypes of animals' habits, such as that pigs [...] "are dirty, fat, and eat filth". [...] Jay further cites Sigmund Freud's view that obscenities that name animals, such as cow, cock, dog, pig, and bitch, gain their power by reducing people to animals.|$|E
500|$|Passover {{has special}} dietary rules, the most {{important}} of which is the prohibition <b>on</b> <b>eating</b> leavened bread or derivatives of this, which are known as chametz. This prohibition is derived from [...] Utensils used in preparing and serving chametz are also forbidden on Passover unless they have been ritually cleansed (kashered). Observant Jews often keep separate sets of meat and dairy utensils for Passover use only. In addition, some groups follow various eating restrictions on Passover that go beyond the rules of kashrut, such as not eating gebrochts or garlic.|$|E
500|$|Starved {{generated}} controversy {{even before}} its premiere.

The National Eating Disorders Association called for a boycott of the show and claimed that Diageo (makers of Tanqueray) and Nautilus agreed to pull their advertising. Schaeffer responded to the controversy, saying [...] "there is some difficult stuff to watch. But I know my spirit and intention are good." ...|$|E
