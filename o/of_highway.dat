On August 18, {{the designation}} {{was added to}} a new section <b>of</b> <b>highway</b> between Crescent and US-64 (now State Highway 164) in Covington. Nearly a year later, the route was extended southward again. The State Highway Commission lengthened SH-74 through Goldsby and Purcell to SH-19 in Maysville on July 1, 1937. The section <b>of</b> <b>highway</b> from Covington to US-60 in Lamont was added on April 14, 1941. On June 5, 1945, it was extended further south to SH-29 in Elmore City (at the time simply named Elmore).|$|E
5|$|At that time, the {{connecting}} link status <b>of</b> <b>Highway</b> 148 through Pembroke itself was revised, {{and the current}} signed terminus of the highway is now Mackay Street, which was formerly Highway 41.|$|E
50|$|The first Board <b>of</b> <b>Highways</b> Commissioners was {{appointed}} by the provincial government in 1912, and the first Department <b>of</b> <b>Highways</b> was established in 1917.

5|$|Ohio had {{completed}} the stretch <b>of</b> <b>highway</b> between I-70 to just before the SR7 interchange by 1976, but due to budget deficiencies work did not resume in Ohio until 1981. Construction of the bridge linking the two portions <b>of</b> <b>highway</b> {{was scheduled to be}} completed by 1981, but construction did not begin until that year. After a 3.3-cent-per-gallon (0.87-cent-per-liter) fuel tax increase, Ohio was able to fund the project again. Bids for construction work on the remainder of the Ohio portion of the freeway were solicited in 1981, with an estimated construction time of 37months for the stretch between I-70 and the bridge.|$|E

5|$|SH-34 {{has always}} been a lengthy highway, {{starting}} with its commissioning in June 1931, when it was a border-to-border highway stretching from Texas to Kansas. Most of SH-34 has followed the same basic corridor since its inception, {{with the exception of the}} portion <b>of</b> <b>highway</b> north of Woodward. The southernmost portion <b>of</b> <b>highway,</b> connecting it to Texas, became solely SH-6 in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Around 1959, M-43 was {{shifted to}} bypass Grand Ledge. The former route through town was {{retained}} {{as a state}} highway, designated Bus. M-43. M-43 was extended from its eastern end in Lansing in 1962 along a section <b>of</b> <b>highway</b> that was formerly part of US16 on Grand River Avenue; the extension to Webberville was made when the I-96 freeway opened that year. Through the Lansing area, M-43 was rerouted off Michigan Avenue downtown. This former routing was renumbered M-143.|$|E

Intense sundowner winds caused the fire to spread rapidly during evening and nighttime hours during its first three days.|$|E
50|$|The pace <b>of</b> {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>highways</b> {{has always}} been rather slow {{up to the present}} days. The first 100 km <b>of</b> <b>highways</b> on the territory of today's Czech Republic were completed in 1975, 500 km in 1985 and 1,000 in 2007. Funding for the construction <b>of</b> <b>highways</b> was radically reduced after the crisis in 2008 due to draconian budget cuts and is currently gaining momentum rather slowly for various reasons.|$|R
50|$|On July 1, 1989 the Department <b>of</b> <b>Highways</b> {{underwent}} another change, {{combining the}} Department <b>of</b> <b>Highways</b> and the Transportation Planning Office {{to become the}} agency {{as we know it}} today—the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT).|$|R

5|$|Cheap {{gasoline}} encouraged automobile ownership, {{which provided}} a substantial revenue source to the government, {{leading to the}} rapid expansion <b>of</b> <b>highway</b> development.

5|$|During the 1936 fiscal year, {{preparations}} {{were made}} for the upcoming merger of the Department of Northern Development and Department <b>of</b> <b>Highway,</b> which occurred on April1, 1937. The town of Bancroft {{was chosen as the}} location of the first operations centre for the new Central District of the department. Consequently, it was decided to extend Highway28 to the town along the remainder of the Burleigh Falls Road.|$|E
5|$|Early roads {{existed in}} the place of FM 1528 by 1936, and a short section <b>of</b> <b>highway</b> between SH 27 (now SH 24) and Klondike was {{designated}} as Loop 39 in 1939, and FM 1528 was designated in 1949. The route of the highway has been altered since its designation, including rerouting due to the construction of Cooper Lake.|$|E

This arrangement would stay in place until 1976, when the Sechelt Queen was transferred on a permanent basis from BC Ferries to the Ministry <b>of</b> <b>Highways</b> fleet.

5|$|In 1678 a local innkeeper, John Barnes was hanged {{after being}} found guilty <b>of</b> <b>highway</b> robbery.

5|$|In 1999, the {{granular}} pavement section <b>of</b> <b>Highway</b> 2 {{south of}} Watrous was tested {{with a cold}} in-place recycling or “CIR” method to rehabilitate highways. This CIR process is a cost-effective method which recycles the top surface of a road. This pulverized material is mixed with asphalt emulsion and spread and compacted back onto the highway surface. This surface is then recovered with a new seal dependent on traffic volume.|$|E
