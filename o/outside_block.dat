In 1998, after further calls to remove the cross, some 300 smaller crosses were erected by local activists near the large one, leading to further protests and heated exchanges.

40|$|In {{this article}} I {{examine how the}} {{performance}} sensitivity of CEO compensation {{is related to the}} level and turnover of <b>outside</b> <b>block</b> ownership. Separating firm performance into firm-specific (Skill) and exogenous (Luck) components, I find that pay sensitivity to Luck increases with blockholder turnover, whereas pay sensitivity to Skill increases with blockholding size. Furthermore, when blockholder turnover is higher, CEO pay increases more with positive Luck but does not decrease as much with negative Luck; also, excess CEO compensation is larger. Thus, the rent accruing to CEOs via asymmetric pay sensitivity to Luck is partly explained by short investment horizons of large shareholders.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the interaction}} between legal shareholder protection, managerial incentives, and outside ownership concentration. Legal protection affects both the expropriation of shareholders and the blockholders incentives to monitor. Because of this latter effect and its repercussion on managerial incentives, outside ownership concentration and legal shareholder protection can be both substitutes or complements. This holds irrespective {{of whether or not}} the large shareholder can reap private benefits. Moreover, better legal protection may exacerbate rather than alleviate the conflict of interest between large and small shareholders. In the extended framework with monetary incentives, ownership is fully dispersed when legal shareholder protection is strong. Otherwise, <b>outside</b> <b>block</b> ownership is optimal and is a substitute to legal protection when the law is of intermediate quality, while it is a complement when the law is poor. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{find that}} units {{are more likely}} to adopt poison pills at the time of a spinoff if their parents have anti-takeover {{provisions}} in place. In addition, the probability that a spinoff unit adopts a poison pill is negatively related to <b>outside</b> <b>block</b> ownership, but positively related {{to the size of the}} unit, institutional ownership, industry takeover activities, and relative industry market-to-book ratio. Units that adopted poison pills elicit a strong negative market response at the time of the spinoff, which implies that investors may believe the pills could prevent the units from being acquired. Despite the initial negative market response, abnormal long-run returns are higher among units that implement poison pills before the spinoff is executed than among units that do not. Moreover, we find that the units' adoption of poison pills does not reduce their likelihood of being acquired, which suggests that the pills may be intended to increase bargaining power rather than prevent takeovers, and could explain the more favorable long-run abnormal returns. Spinoffs Poison pills...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the relation}} between a firm's equity capital structure, managerial and <b>outside</b> <b>block</b> ownership, and firm value based on a unique and hand-collected sample of 545 observations on 174 Swiss firms over the period from 2002 to 2005. While previous papers concentrate either on managerial ownership or on blockholdings, which can, but need not be, managerial, this article distinguishes between the two and investigates their relative importance. This distinction {{turns out to be}} important. I find the probability that a firm has a dual-class structure to be positively related to managerial ownership, the ownership of the single largest shareholder, and inside blockholders more generally while negatively related to the ownership of 'true' outside blockholders such as listed companies, mutual and pension funds. Moreover, I present strong evidence that the aim of the dual-class structure is to secure the largest shareholder's and, more specifically, inside blockholders' control over the firm. Most importantly, I find evidence that these inside controlling shareholders take advantage of the dual-class structure by extracting private benefits of control. ...|$|E

40|$|In this research, we find {{statistically}} significant positive abnormal returns around takeover announcements for combined firms. The cumulative average abnormal returns for combined firms are 4. 62 % over the event-window [- 20, + 20], {{which suggests that}} takeovers create shareholder wealth (synergy motive). In addition, we {{examine the impact of}} ownership structure in target firms on the abnormal returns to shareholders of combined firms. We show that management shareholdings have a significant negative impact on the returns to shareholders of combined firms (entrenchment). Institutional shareholdings and <b>outside</b> <b>block</b> holdings have a significantly positive influence on the abnormal returns to shareholder of combined firms. These results suggest that monitoring by large institutional shareholders and other outside shareholders increase the abnormal returns to shareholders of the combined firm. Furthermore, competition between bidders increases the abnormal returns to shareholders of combined firms. Competition between bidding firms might signal to high valuation bidders the availability of high, non-firm-specific synergistic gains. The positive relation between the market-to-book value of the target and the returns to shareholders of the combined firm indicate that the target firm has large growth opportunities, which will increase the value of the combined firm...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we address the {{question}} whether insider ownership affects corporate performance. Evidence coming from studies dealing with Anglo-Saxon countries is rather inconclusive, especially because it seems that results are significantly affected by endogeneity. Economically, {{this is due to}} the fact that in these countries insider ownership seems to be mainly driven by management's compensation contracts. We argue that Germany is different in this regard, as insider ownership often is related to family control, stock-based compensation is less widespread and the market for corporate control is less developed. Starting from this presumption our data allows to make an unbiased observation as to whether insider ownership affects firm performance. Using a pooled data set of 648 firm observations for the years 2003 and 1998 we find evidence for a positive and significant relationship between corporate performance as measured by stock price performance, market-to-book ratio and return on assets and insider ownership. This relationship seems to be rather robust, even if we account for endogeneity by applying a 2 SLS regression approach. Moreover, we also find <b>outside</b> <b>block</b> ownership as well as more concentrated insider ownership to have a positive impact on corporate performance. Overall the results indicate that ownership structure might be an important variable explaining the long term value creation in the corporate sector.

40|$|It is {{important}} to understand what influence managers to provide voluntary information to outside investors and whether the information provided by management is perceived to be credible by outside shareholders and stakeholders. Using the annual reports of 155 Malaysian listed companies, this study investigates the competing effects of information costs and ownership structure on the extent and perceived credibility of corporate voluntary disclosure during the period when public listed companies in Malaysia faced new corporate governance regulation. Results of this study provide evidence that management does not perceive their voluntary information to have sufficient signalling potential to create competitive disadvantage for their company. Findings from the study also indicate that higher percentage of <b>outside</b> <b>block</b> holder ownership has the potential to strengthen corporate transparency. However, the return-earnings relation revealed that the extent of voluntary disclosures does not give sufficient confidence to analysts and outside investors in evaluation of their stocks. Corporate disclosure has been subjected to calls for transparency as part of the corporate governance movement, in particular among companies in the East Asian countries. Disclosure of voluntary information, in particular is a sensitive management decision which can reveal proprietary information to user groups such as shareholders and also competitors who can act on the information disclosed to the competitive disadvantage of the disclosing companies (e. g.

40|$|I {{examine the}} market {{reaction}} to merger announcements {{and the long-term}} post-merger stock price performance of newly merged firms. For a sample of 484 acquiring firms completing mergers between 1993 and 2000, the average value-weighted abnormal announcement date return (market-adjusted) is a statistically significant - 1. 02 %. On average, this reaction is more negative for firms with "good governance. " Specifically, a governance index comprised of three governance variables is significantly negative in a multivariate regression of announcement date abnormal returns. Comp is the percentage of CEO salary consisting of equity incentives (including stock options and restricted stock grants), InsideOwn is {{the percentage of the}} firm owned by officers and directors, and InstOwn is the percentage of the firm owned by large <b>outside</b> <b>block</b> shareholders. Value-weighted calendar-time portfolios consisting of the full sample of acquirers exhibit significant abnormal returns of 9. 12 %, 33. 84 % and 55. 8 % for the 12, 36 and 60 months following the merger, respectively. This overperformance is limited to the value-weighted portfolios. There is calendar-time evidence of abnormal performance for some subsamples on a risk adjusted basis. However, when compared to a control group, abnormal performance is limited to large glamour acquirers on a 12 -month horizon, large cash acquirers on a 36 and 60 -month horizon, and small focusing acquirers on a 60 -month horizon. Multivariate analysis of long-run returns reveals that use of equity and corporate diversification are associated with lower post-merger performance. With regard to governance and long-run stock returns, there is also evidence that suggests higher levels of incentive compensation for CEOs is associated with more successful merger transactions for long-term investors...|$|E
