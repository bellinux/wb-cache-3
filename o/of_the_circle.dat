5|$|The {{excavation}} {{revealed that}} {{the location of the}} stones was not their original prehistoric position. The original location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> was identified as existing a few feet to the west, under the adjacent hedge. The original circle had either eight or possibly nine sockets for stones and was oval shaped. The perimeter of the ring was defined by V-shaped ditches on its eastern and western perimeters. The maximum axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> would have been approximately 20 feet (6.5 metres), making it considerably smaller than the size proposed by the Piggotts.|$|E

5|$|The same {{algebraic}} equations can {{be derived}} {{in the context of}} Lie sphere geometry. That geometry represents circles, lines and points in a unified way, as a five-dimensional vector X = (v, c'x, c'y, w, sr), where c = (c'x, c'y) is the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> and r is its (non-negative) radius. If r is not zero, the sign s may be positive or negative; for visualization, s represents the orientation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> with counterclockwise circles having a positive s and clockwise circles having a negative s. The parameter w is zero for a straight line, and one otherwise.|$|E

Kanyenke agrees and reveals that he knows about John's relationship with Nonahkee. He tells him that he would not have chosen John as her husband, but he accepts it because he knows that she decides who she loves.|$|E

Stairs from the east and west, aligned with the apse, used to lead up to the ambon.

5|$|A {{number of}} these circles {{were built in the}} area around modern Dorset, {{typically}} being smaller than those found elsewhere. Most of these Dorset circles are made of sarsen stone, although the Rempstone circle is unique in being made from local sandstone. The southern half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> has been destroyed, with five upright and three recumbent stones remaining extant. Having been damaged by eighteenth century clay workings, the monument is at present situated within dense woodland. In 1957, a possible avenue of stones leading to the circle was discovered by ploughing but subsequently removed. Local folklore holds that the stones arrived in their position after being thrown at Corfe Castle by the Devil.|$|E
5|$|Although Exmoor {{witnessed}} {{the construction of}} a large number of monuments during the Bronze Age, only two stone circles survive in this area, the other being Porlock Stone Circle. The Withypool ring is located on the south-western slope of Withypool Hill, on an area of heathland. In diameter it measures 36.4 metres (119 feet, 6 inches) across. Around thirty small gritstones remain as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle,</b> which may originally have held around one hundred; there are conspicuous gaps on the northern and western ends of the monument. The site was rediscovered in 1898 and subsequently surveyed by the archaeologist Harold St George Gray in 1905.|$|E

5|$|As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> {{around the}} prince, however, Gaveston also became {{entangled}} in {{conflicts between the}} King and his son. These difficulties first materialised in a dispute between treasurer Walter Langton and Prince Edward. The case enraged King Edward {{to the point where}} he banned his son from court, and banished several men from the prince's household. Though the two were reconciled at a later point, the King still prevented Gaveston from rejoining the prince. This matter was settled before 26 May 1306, however, the date when Gaveston was knighted, four days after the prince. Later that year Gaveston was once more in trouble, when he and twenty-one other knights deserted a Scottish campaign to attend a tournament. An arrest order was sent out for the deserters, but, at the insistence of Queen Margaret, they were all pardoned in January 1307.|$|E
5|$|Burst {{time offset}} (BTO) – the time {{difference}} between when a signal is sent from the ground station and when the response is received. This measure is proportional to twice {{the distance from the}} ground station via the satellite to the aircraft and includes the time that the SDU takes between receiving and responding to the message and time between reception and processing at the ground station. This measure can be analysed to determine the distance between the satellite and the aircraft. As a result, one can define a circle on the Earth's surface the points on whose circumference are equidistant from the satellite at the calculated distance, and in turn this circle can be reduced to arcs by eliminating parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>circle</b> that are outside the aircraft's range.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as to}} take advantage of the touch screen, 3D has vastly unique controls when compared to other games in the Metal Gear series. While the game has been heavily criticized for these control changes, use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Circle</b> Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much of the control issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second analog stick, adding ZL and ZR buttons for aiming and attacking, and allowing the face buttons to be used in a manner more in line with all other releases in the Metal Gear series.|$|E
