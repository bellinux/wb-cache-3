5|$|All the {{interesting}} cases of homotopy groups of spheres involve mappings from a higher-dimensional sphere <b>onto</b> <b>one</b> of lower dimension. Unfortunately, the only example which {{can easily be}} visualized is not interesting: there are no nontrivial mappings from the ordinary sphere to the circle. Hence, π2(S1) = 0. This is because S1 has the real line as its universal cover which is contractible (it has the homotopy type of a point). In addition, because S2 is simply connected, by the lifting criterion, any map from S2 to S1 can be lifted to a map into the real line and the nullhomotopy descends to the downstairs space.|$|E

5|$|L.A. Noire was {{developed}} for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and later ported to Microsoft Windows. Windows copies of the game are distributed on two DVD discs, while Xbox 360 copies are distributed on three; the PlayStation 3 version fits <b>onto</b> <b>one</b> Blu-Ray Disc. A total of 16 cases—the game's form of missions that advance the game's narrative—were removed from {{the final version of}} the game as they would not have fit on one Blu-ray Disc; while five of these cases were later released as downloadable content, eleven cases from the departments Bunko and Burglary were completely removed.|$|E
5|$|The Incredible Hulk was {{released}} on Blu-ray and DVD on October 21, 2008. It includes behind-the-scenes featurettes, audio commentary, deleted scenes, and an alternate opening. The film was number one in sales when released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 21, 2008, in the United States (having been available in the United Kingdom since October 13). There are widescreen and fullscreen single-disc editions; a three-disc special edition; and a two-disc Blu-ray package. The first disc contains an audio commentary by Leterrier and Roth, while the second comes with special features and deleted scenes, and the third with a digital copy of the film. The Blu-ray edition compresses {{the content of the}} first two DVDs <b>onto</b> <b>one,</b> while the second disc contains the digital copy.|$|E
5|$|The {{use of a}} wing-forward was a {{distinctive}} feature of New Zealand play. Instead of having eight men in the scrum as was normal elsewhere, seven men were usedthe missing man, the wing-forward, instead fed {{the ball into the}} scrum then held <b>onto</b> <b>one</b> of their hookers while the ball progressed through the scrum to their half-back. With the wing-forward bound {{to the side of the}} scrum, the opposing half-back would then have to manoeuvre past him to tackle the player with the ball. This increased the amount of time the half-back would have in possession of the ball before his opposite could tackle him.|$|E

5|$|Wise asked Harold Michelson {{to be the}} film's {{production}} designer, and Michelson was put to work on {{finishing the}} incomplete Phase II sets. The designer began with the bridge, which had nearly been completed. Michelson first removed Chekov's new weapons station, a semicircular plastic bubble grafted <b>onto</b> <b>one</b> {{side of the bridge}} wall. The idea for Phase II was that Chekov would have looked out toward space while crosshairs in the bubble tracked targets. Wise instead wanted Chekov's station to face the Enterprises main viewer, a difficult request as the set was primarily circular. Production illustrator Michael Minor created a new look for the station using a flat edge {{in the corner of the}} set.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{the usual}} product {{development}} cycle, which grows a concept into a final product, {{most of the}} development work in Rare Replay was in converging 30 games across six platforms <b>onto</b> <b>one</b> disc. The engineering challenge lay in the quantity of games and platforms being emulated rather than the emulation effort itself. Rare worked in close collaboration with Microsoft, who were secretly developing the Xbox One's backward-compatibility features, which Rare ultimately used in Rare Replay. The Microsoft team helped prepare Rare's nine Xbox 360 games for the release. Their discontinued online services were not restored for the compilation. On Rare Replay design, lead designer Paul Collins added that the Snapshot challenges were built to encourage players to sample all of the games, and that the rewind feature was to help all players finish the games without quitting in frustration. The compilation's opening musical number was a compromise from the original vision: a musical history of the company's oeuvre, as told through small musical introductions to each Snapshot. The final opening was intended to evoke players' memories of Rare properties, and includes several Easter eggs.|$|E
5|$|When Nao {{received}} news Card {{had arrived}} in Saigon, he inspected the equipment which now included a new battery and a redesigned bomb. Again, Nao decided to set off the bombs during {{the early hours of}} May 2, so that he and his fellow operative could escape safely and avoid inflicting casualties on the local population. But due to illness, Cay declined {{to take part in the}} operation, so Hung had to replace him. At around 9am on May 1, Nao rushed to Hung’s home, where the latter was given a hand grenade and was notified of an upcoming operation without much detail. At 6pm, after Nao had finished unloading the bombs <b>onto</b> <b>one</b> canoe, he and Hung traveled down the Saigon River in two separate canoes, towards the commercial port district. Both men than pulled over in the Thu Thiem area, to avoid detection from South Vietnamese authorities by intermingling with the local workers who lived there. While waiting for the right time, Nao briefed Hung on the objectives of the operation, which was to sink the largest American ship at the Saigon Port, and promptly report the results back to headquarters.|$|E

5|$|With the {{breakthrough}} of third wave ska into the American mainstream by late 1996, the Daddies seemed poised for commercial success, landing {{a spot on}} a well-publicized national tour with popular ska bands Reel Big Fish and Let's Go Bowling. Although the band were mainly playing ska shows at the time, they soon began drawing a sizable following for their swing material when the coincident success of the film Swingers and its featured band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy started drawing public and media attention towards the formerly underground swing revival movement. When fans regularly began approaching the band's merchandise table asking which of their albums contained the most swing, the Daddies realized they lacked an album fully representing their swing side, prompting the band's manager to convince them to compile all of their swing songs <b>onto</b> <b>one</b> CD until {{they could afford to}} make a new album, using their available finances to record several bonus tracks for inclusion. The result, , became an unexpectedly popular item as the band went on tour, reportedly selling as many as 4,000 copies a week through their Northwest distributors.|$|E
