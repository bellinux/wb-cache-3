In this study, {{the upper and lower}} bounds of the <b>overall</b> false alarm <b>probability</b> and <b>overall</b> detection <b>probability</b> are derived as functions of the bit-error probabilities (BERs) of the CR-FC links.

500|$|Suppose {{we start}} with one {{electron}} at a certain place and time (this place and time being given the arbitrary label A) and a photon at another place and time (given the label B). A typical question from a physical standpoint is: 'What is the probability of finding an electron at C (another place and a later time) and a photon at D (yet another place and time)?'. The simplest process to achieve this end is for the electron to move from A to C (an elementary action) and for the photon to move from B to D (another elementary action). From {{a knowledge of the}} probability amplitudes of each of these sub-processes – E(A to C) and P(B to D) – then we would expect to calculate the probability amplitude of both happening together by multiplying them, using rule b) above. This gives a simple estimated <b>overall</b> <b>probability</b> amplitude, which is squared to give an estimated probability. [...] But there are other ways in which the end result could come about. The electron might move to a place and time E where it absorbs the photon; then move on before emitting another photon at F; then move on to C where it is detected, [...] while the new photon moves on to D. The probability of this complex process can again be calculated by knowing the probability amplitudes of each of the individual actions: three electron actions, two photon actions and two vertexes – one emission and one absorption. We would expect to find the total probability amplitude by multiplying the probability amplitudes of each of the actions, for any chosen positions of E and F. We then, using rule a) above, have to add up all these probability amplitudes for all the alternatives for E and F. (This is not elementary in practice, and involves integration.) But there is another possibility, which is that the electron first moves to G where it emits a photon which goes on to D, while the electron moves on to H, where it absorbs the first photon, before moving on to C. Again we can calculate the probability amplitude of these possibilities (for all points G and H). We then have a better estimation for the total probability amplitude by adding the probability amplitudes of these two possibilities to our original simple estimate. Incidentally the name given to this process of a photon interacting with an electron in this way is Compton scattering.|$|E

40|$|Wireless energy {{harvesting}} {{can improve the}} performance of cognitive wireless sensor networks (WSNs). This paper considers radio frequency (RF) {{energy harvesting}} from transmissions in the primary spectrum for cognitive WSNs. The <b>overall</b> success <b>probability</b> of the energy harvesting cognitive WSN depends on the transmission success probability and energy success probability. Using the tools from stochastic geometry, we show that the <b>overall</b> success <b>probability</b> can be optimized with respect to: 1) transmit power of the sensors; 2) transmit power of the primary transmitters; and 3) spatial density of the primary transmitters. In this context, an optimization algorithm is proposed to maximize the <b>overall</b> success <b>probability</b> of the WSNs. Simulation {{results show that the}} <b>overall</b> success <b>probability</b> and the throughput of the WSN can be significantly improved by optimizing the aforementioned three parameters. As RF energy harvesting can also be performed indoors, hence, our solution can be directly applied to the cognitive WSNs that are installed in smart buildings...|$|R
