In response to these evolutions and anticipating on fast changing IT-technologies, Flanders Environment Agency has developed {{a set of}} next generation tools for <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology.</b> These tools are flexible, open and integrate all major components of the water system (principle toolbox). Rather than just providing a set of tools, the toolbox is integrated into existing information systems by the latest technologies using open standards and web protocols. Currently, the toolbox is used to establish a regional hydrological model set for Flanders. This large scale model will produce information on the hydrological status (runoff, subflow, infiltration, soil storage, etc.) at any location in Flanders. Furthermore, an interactive web-application of the toolbox was developed to enable hydrological modelling through the internet.

40|$|Abstract The use {{of remote}} sensing {{information}} in <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology</b> is relatively limited, but specific examples can be cited for determining precipitation, soil moisture, groundwater, snow, surface water and basin characteristics. The application of remote sensing in hydrology can be termed operational if {{at least one}} of two conditions are met: (a) the application produces an output on a regular basis, or (b) the remote sensing data are used regularly on a continuing basis as part of a procedure to solve a problem or make decisions. When surveying the various operational applications, simple approaches and simple remote sensing data sets are the most successful. In the data-sparse developing countries, many operational remote sensing approaches exist (out of necessity) that may not be needed in developed countries because of existing data networks. To increase the use of remote sensing in <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology</b> in developed countries, pilot projects need to be increased and information services must be improved.

40|$|International audienceThe {{end users}} of {{hydrological}} models may be justified for being {{tired of the}} excessive uncertainty of these models, not to mention their simplistic approximations and crude modelling. The ever-increasing sophistication of model parameter fitting is simply a smoke-screen that hides the models' lack of physical basis, their scale dependence, and their inability to fit widely diverse behaviours. More generally, we have to admit a lack of qualitative improvement in hydrological modelling in recent times. In fact, <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology</b> may have suffered for some time from ignoring the advances in theoretical hydrology, which have, in contrast, greatly stimulated the nonlinear sciences. For instance, {{more than a century}} ago fractals were considered as geometrical monsters, whereas decades ago river networks became classical fractal objects, and rainfall and discharges are now classical examples of multifractal fields. These hydrological characteristics are still often ignored by <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology,</b> whereas they explain not only its current limitations, but also how to overcome them. To illustrate these problems, this paper focuses on the fact that hydrological fields are most likely singular with respect to measures of time and volume. This would not only explain the ubiquitous scale dependence of hydrological observations, but would also give the possibility to transform them into scale-independent quantities. The upscaling of a rainfall time series from an hour to a year is therefore discussed in detail, and enables us to quickly introduce other examples...|$|R

40|$|The {{reliable}} {{estimation of}} hydrological variables (e. g. soil moisture, evapotranspiration, surface temperature) {{in space and}} time is of fundamental importance in <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology</b> to improve the forecast of the rainfall-runoff response of catchments and, consequently, flood predictions. Nowadays remote sensing can offer a chance to provide good space-time estimates of several hydrological variables and then improve hydrological model performances especially in environments with scarce ground based data. The aim of this work is to investigate the impacts on the performances of a distributed hydrological model (Continuum) of the assimilation of satellite-derived soil moisture products and Land Surface (LST). In this work three different soil moisture (SM) products, derived by ASCAT sensor, are used. These data are provided by the EUMETSAT’s H-SAF (Satellite Application Facility on Support to <b>Operational</b> <b>Hydrology</b> and Water Management) program. The considered soil moisture products are: large scale surface soil moisture (SM OBS 1 - H 07), small scale surface soil moisture (SM OBS 2 - H 08) and profile index in the roots region (SM DAS 2 - H 14). These data are compared with soil moisture estimated by Continuum model on the Orba catchment (800 km 2), {{in the northern part of}} Italy, for the period July 2012 -June 2013. Different assimilation experiments have been performed. The first experiment consists in the assimilation of the SM products by using a simple Nudging technique; the second one is the assimilation of only LST data, derived from MSG satellite, and the third is the assimilation of both SM products and LST.

40|$|The compilation, collection, analysis, and {{simulation}} of UPRP streamflow and water-quality information were undertaken {{in order to}} assess the expected levels and variability of {{the quantity and quality of}} the surface waters in relation to the meteorology and hydrology of the area [...] the intended objectives of the project [...] and the modes of system operation. Under the two major phases of the study, important aspects which were examined were the availability and adequacy of the data base, and the applicability of modeling schemes to simulate the observed properties of the data. The major objective in the <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology</b> phase was to test the applicability of <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology</b> in a tropical environment. A stochastic model was fitted to the streamflow data of the extended UPRP inflows in order to serve as a generator of synthetic monthly streamflows which are used as inputs to operational studies of the project. As an initial requirement, the historical record was augmented by means of regional estimation techniques and a statistical data augmentation scheme. The percent deviation method of data augmentation was selected and applied, based on the results of a comparison of four augmentation methods. Two normalizing transformations were applied on the augmented-historical data in order to express them as statistical variables amenable to synthesis. These were the logarithmic transformation and Harter's table interpolation scheme. A time series analysis applied on the normalized data prescribed the adoption of the separate-monthly Matalas model for synthesis. The application of the model yielded synthetic streamflows which satisfactorily reproduced the correlation coefficients, means, and standard deviations of the augmentedhistorical monthly flows. Model extensions and refinements were recommended in order to surmount model limitations. In general, the applicability of <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology</b> in a tropical environment has been demonstrated. The quality of the UPRP surface water was characterized in order to provide background information which is essential in determining the suitability of the water for fishery development in the reservoir, for irrigation, and for domestic and industrial use. The Pantabangan reservoir was characterized in terms of observed patterns of temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity. An annual cycle was observed which exhibits intermittently disturbed and moderate stratification in the wet season, full circulation and isothermal condition during the cool, windy, and dry months, and a short warm period favorable to stratification prior to the heavy rains. Atmospheric reaeration was identified to be the major contributor of dissolved oxygen to the reservoir water. The application of the Markofsky-Harleman predictive model for reservoir temperature and dissolved oxygen emphasized the need for substantial data on the hydrology, meteorology, hydrodynamics, and water quality in the reservoir which are required as model inputs. The best agreement between observed and predicted temperature and DO was obtained for cool, windy, and dry months of December to February. Limitations in the input data and in the assumed parameters were observed. The available and collected water-quality data in the reservoir and streams of the UPRP indicated a salinity level as low as or less than 100 ppm in the headwaters to as high as 300 ppm in the outflows from the irrigation service area. The surface water is essentially the alkaline-bicarbonate type. The heavy runoff during the wet season produces a dilution of the TDS, but causes the conveyance of considerable amounts of sediment to the reservoir and river channels. An approximate salt balance for the project area yielded estimates of net amounts of salts leached from the area per season...|$|R

40|$|An {{existing}} non-parametric {{method for}} using meteorology probability forecasts in <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology</b> builds {{a sample of}} possibilities for the future, of climate series from the historical re-cord, which is weighted to agree with selected forecasts of meteorology probabilities. It concen-trates on isolated event probabilities {{rather than on the}} entire probability distribution of various variables. It sometimes assigns the same weight to all climate series in selected categories, re-sulting in the same relative frequency for those climate series. This results in a discontinuity in the probability distribution at interval boundaries. By changing to a parametric approach, one determines entire probability distributions that match available forecast meteorology probabili-ties. This allows a continuous distribution of probability across a variable, allowing more mean-ingful interpretations for all values of the variable, such as avoiding too much probability in the tails. However, a parametric method is difficult to apply when multiple variables are considered because the assumption of a distribution(s) further constrains the matching of probabilistic mete-orology forecasts. The existing non-parametric method provides useful elimination of conflict-ing probability constraints until a feasible solution exists. The non-parametric method can b...|$|R

40|$|Because the {{distribution}} of soil and vegetative moisture is essentially unknowable at operationally useful temporal and spatial scales, hydrologists interested in quantifying actual evapotranspiration (ET) use potential evaporation (E 0) to quantify ET’s upper limit. ET is then estimated by scaling down from E 0 using simple vegetation-related coefficients or land-surface models. This paradigm underpins much of <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology,</b> including streamflow prediction, water management in municipalities and agriculture, and other decision-making enterprises that rely on real-time quantification of surface water availability. This widespread use of E 0 motivates a need for measures that rely on physically appropriate forcings, that yield accurate results at time and space scales relevant to operational goals, and that avoid extraneous modeling uncertainty or the omission of key sources of variability. The primary goal of our study is to meet this need To understand the sources of variability of E 0, a mean-value, second-moment uncertainty analysis is applied to a 30 -year, CONUS-distributed dataset of daily synthetic pan evaporation derived from the “PenPan” model, a combination equation that mimics observations from US Class A evaporation pans. For drivers, we use six North American Land Data Assimilation System variables: temperature, specific humidity, station pressure, wind speed, and downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation. The variability of E 0 is decomposed across various time scales into contributions from these drivers. We find that, contrary to popular expectation and much hydrologic practice, temperature {{is not always the}} most significant driver of temporal variability in E 0, particularly at sub-annual time scales. Instead, depending on the region and the season, one of four drivers (temperature, specific humidity, downwelling shortwave radiation, and wind speed) dominates across different regions of CONUS. Temperature, specific humidity, downwelling shortwave radiation, and wind speed must together be examined, with downwelling longwave radiation as a secondary input. If any variable may be ignored, it is atmospheric pressure. While temperature generally dominates in the northern continental interior, parameterizations based solely on temperature should be avoided over large areas and at sub-annual time scales. Our results have clear implications for modeling E 0 in <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology</b> or as a metric of climate change and variability; not least in assisting land surface modelers find a balance between parameter parsimony and physical representativeness.

40|$|Reliable {{estimation}} of hydrological soil moisture state is {{of critical importance}} in <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology</b> to improve the flood prediction and hydrological cycle description. Although {{there have been a}} number of soil moisture products, they cannot be directly used in hydrological modelling. This paper attempts for the first time to build a soil moisture product directly applicable to hydrology using multiple data sources retrieved from SAC-SMA (soil moisture), MODIS (land surface temperature), and SMOS (multi-angle brightness temperatures in H–V polarisations). The simple yet effective local linear regression model is applied for the data fusion purpose in the Pontiac catchment. Four schemes according to temporal availabilities of the data sources are developed, which are pre-assessed and best selected by using the well-proven feature selection algorithm gamma test.

40|$|Increased {{automation}} {{and use of}} computer-aided {{decision support}} systems are attractive options for hydrologic forecasting agencies faced with growing product complexity and institutional resourcing pressures. Although the hydrologic literature has been nearly silent on the roles of expertise and automation in forecasting, other disciplines such as meteorology have had decades of open discussion on the topic. To address the lack of dialogue in hydrology on automation, this article seeks to contextualize relevant findings from similar disciplines, including meteorology, psychology, decision support systems, and interface design. We predict which aspects of <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology</b> have the greatest chance for successfully increasing automation in the near future. Some applications have employed higher levels of automation, notably flash flood forecasting which requires rapid response times, and extended prediction which requires heavy emphasis on uncertainty quantification. Short-range flood forecasting may be more challenging to automate and traditionally has been less automated than other types of forecasts, partly because of existing practices of interfacing with meteorologists and water system operators, and the difficulties in modeling human impacts on the water cycle. Overall, we suggest that the design of computer-aided decision support systems for forecasting systems should consider three factors: (1) processes change under automation and people may require new roles; (2) automation changes the way people behave, sometimes negatively; and (3) people may not have accurate perceptions {{of the quality of}} the automated guidance. Seven lessons learned from automation in meteorology are highlighted and translated into a hydrologic forecasting context, leading to a set of recommendations for how to make best use of expertise in increasingly automated systems...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Early {{warning and}} {{monitoring}} {{activities in the}} field of <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology</b> – and any other natural hazard management field – are crucial in order to limit damages to life and assets caused by extreme natural events. Statistics show that hydro-meteorological events both on a global and a local scale are increasing in their number of occurrence as well as in their intensities. Decision makers such as operational hydrologists must be enabled to quickly and comprehensively overlook an on-going situation, to go more into its details and then take further actions in collaboration with crisis management groups based on the information they have. Thus, more than ever, real-time data from different measurement networks and sources have to be compiled, processed and presented in real-time to these decision makers. The scientific, cartographic challenge is to deliver automated, real-time visualizations in consideration of sound cartographic rules and standards. In this paper, the conceptualization of a web-based cartographic real-time information system is presented. Based on this concept, a prototype has been tested that integrates acquisition, processing and visualizations of real-time hydro-meteorological data in different ways, depending on the chosen timeframe and level of detail. Besides monitoring visualizations, data are retraceable using visualizations that clearly stress the course of the event and the data’s spatio-temporal character. Further visualizations and functionalities are provided that allow for putting real-time data in relation to a broader historical context. Data are instantaneously retrievable from a data archive, classified and visualized in order to learn from former events and experiences...|$|R
40|$|In <b>operational</b> <b>hydrology,</b> {{estimation}} of predictive uncertainty of hydrological models used for flood modelling {{is essential for}} risk based decision making for flood warning and emergency management. In the literature, there exists {{a variety of methods}} analyzing and predicting uncertainty. However, case studies comparing performance of these methods, most particularly predictive uncertainty methods, are limited. This paper focuses on two predictive uncertainty methods that differ in their methodological complexity: quantile regression (QR) and UNcertainty Estimation based on local Errors and Clustering (UNEEC), aiming at identifying possible advantages and disad vantages of these methods (both estimating residual uncertainty) based on their comparative performance. We test these two methods on several catchments (from UK) that vary in its hydrological characteristics and models. Special attention is given to the errors for high flow/water level conditions. Furthermore, normality of model residuals is discussed in view of clustering approach employed within the framework of UNEEC method. It is found that basin lag time and forecast lead time have great impact on quantification of uncertainty (in the form of two quantiles) and achievement of normality in model residuals’ distribution. In general, uncertainty analysis results from different case studies indicate that both methods give similar results. However, it is also shown that UNEEC method provides better performance than QR for small catchments with changing hydrological dynamics, i. e. rapid response catchments. We recommend that more case studies of catchments from regions of distinct hydrologic behaviour, with diverse climatic conditions, and having various hydrological features be tested.

This paper focuses on the methods predicting model residual uncertainty that differ in methodological complexity: quantile regression (QR) and UNcertainty Estimation based on local Errors and Clustering (UNEEC). The comparison of the methods is aimed at investigating how well a simpler method using fewer input data performs over a more complex method with more predictors. We test these two methods on several catchments from the UK that vary in hydrological characteristics and the models used. Special attention is given to the methods' performance under different hydrological conditions. Furthermore, normality of model residuals in data clusters (identified by UNEEC) is analysed. It is found that basin lag time and forecast lead time have a large impact on the quantification of uncertainty and the presence of normality in model residuals' distribution.
