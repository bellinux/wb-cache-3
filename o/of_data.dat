The course curriculum is organized around four basic themes; the first involves exploring data and covers 20–30% of the exam. Students are expected to use graphical and numerical techniques to analyze distributions <b>of</b> <b>data,</b> including univariate, bivariate, and categorical data. The second theme involves planning and conducting a study and covers 10–15% of the exam. Students {{must be aware of}} the various methods <b>of</b> <b>data</b> collection through sampling or experimentation and the sorts of conclusions that can be drawn from the results. The third theme involves probability and its role in anticipating patterns in distributions <b>of</b> <b>data.</b> This theme covers 20–30% of the exam. The fourth theme, which covers 30–40% of the exam, involves statistical inference using point estimation, confidence intervals, and significance tests.|$|E
