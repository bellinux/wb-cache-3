5|$|Several {{figures in}} Eisenhower's administration, {{including}} Secretary of State John Foster Dulles {{and his brother}} CIA Director Allen Dulles, had {{close ties to the}} United Fruit Company. The Dulles brothers had worked for the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, and in that capacity had arranged several deals for the UFC. Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith would later become a director of the company, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These personal connections meant that the Eisenhower administration tended to conflate the interests of the UFC with that of U.S. national security interests, and made it more willing to <b>overthrow</b> <b>the</b> Guatemalan government. The success of the 1953 CIA operation to <b>overthrow</b> <b>the</b> democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran also strengthened Eisenhower's belief in using the agency to effect political change overseas.|$|E

5|$|Árbenz's {{enactment}} of Decree 900 in 1952 provoked Truman to authorize Operation PBFORTUNE, a covert operation to overthrow Árbenz. The plan {{had originally been}} suggested by the US-backed dictator of Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García, who {{said that if he}} were given weapons, he could <b>overthrow</b> <b>the</b> Guatemalan government. The operation was to be led by Carlos Castillo Armas. However, the US state department discovered the conspiracy, and secretary of state Dean Acheson persuaded Truman to abort the plan. After being elected president of the US in November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower was more willing than Truman to use military tactics to remove regimes he disliked. Several figures in his administration, including Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and his brother and CIA director Allen Dulles had close ties to the United Fruit Company. Undersecretary of State Bedell Smith later became a director of the UFC, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant.

The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.|$|E
