5|$|<b>Oxytocin</b> (OXT) {{deficiency}} generally causes few symptoms, {{as it is}} only {{required at}} the time of childbirth and breastfeeding.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism is made on blood tests. Two types of blood tests {{are used to}} confirm {{the presence of a}} hormone deficiency: basal levels, where blood samples are taken–usually in the morning–without any form of stimulation, and dynamic tests, where blood tests are taken after the injection of a stimulating substance. Measurement of ACTH and growth hormone usually requires dynamic testing, whereas the other hormones (LH/FSH, prolactin, TSH) can typically be tested with basal levels. There is no adequate direct test for ADH levels, but ADH deficiency can be confirmed indirectly; <b>oxytocin</b> levels are not routinely measured.|$|E
5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located at}} the base of the brain, and intimately connected with the hypothalamus. It consists of two lobes: the posterior pituitary, which consists of nervous tissue branching out of the hypothalamus, and the anterior pituitary, which consists of hormone-producing epithelium. The posterior pituitary secretes antidiuretic hormone, which regulates osmolarity of the blood, and <b>oxytocin,</b> which causes contractions of the uterus in childbirth and participates in breastfeeding.|$|E
5|$|The lateral {{hypothalamus}} contains orexinergic neurons {{that control}} appetite and arousal through their projections to the ascending reticular activating system. The hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland through {{the release of}} peptides such as <b>oxytocin,</b> and vasopressin, as well as dopamine into the median eminence. Through the autonomic projections, the hypothalamus is involved in regulating functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, breathing, sweating, and other homeostatic mechanisms. The hypothalamus also {{plays a role in}} thermal regulation, and when stimulated by the immune system, is capable of generating a fever. The hypothalamus is influenced by the kidneys – when blood pressure falls, the renin released by the kidneys stimulates a need to drink. The hypothalamus also regulates food intake through autonomic signals, and hormone release by the digestive system.|$|E
5|$|The vital {{nature of}} coping {{with the lack of}} {{resources}} available in international emergency medicine may be seen in the proportion of scientific articles that grapple with the topic. Of the top 27 articles identified by a review of the international emergency medicine literature from 2010, 14 were classified as dealing with the practice of emergency medicine in resource-constrained environments. A new dimension of thought is that of the isolated subject of technology for trauma care as published in the World Journal of Surgery by Mihir Shah et al. Topics covered included the use of the Broselow tape as the best estimate for children's weight, green bananas as an effective treatment for diarrhea, and misoprostol as a potential alternative for postpartum hemorrhage when <b>oxytocin</b> is not available.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxytocin</b> {{produces}} antidepressant-like {{effects in}} animal models of depression, and {{a deficit of}} it {{may be involved in}} the pathophysiology of depression in humans. The antidepressant-like effects of <b>oxytocin</b> are not blocked by a selective antagonist of the <b>oxytocin</b> receptor, suggesting that these effects are not mediated by the <b>oxytocin</b> receptor. In accordance, unlike <b>oxytocin,</b> the selective non-peptide <b>oxytocin</b> receptor agonist WAY-267,464 does not produce antidepressant-like effects, at least in the tail suspension test. In contrast to WAY-267,464, carbetocin, a close analogue of <b>oxytocin</b> and peptide <b>oxytocin</b> receptor agonist, notably does produce antidepressant-like effects in animals. As such, the antidepressant-like effects of <b>oxytocin</b> may be mediated by modulation of a different target, perhaps the vasopressin V1A receptor where <b>oxytocin</b> is known to weakly bind as an agonist.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxytocin</b> is {{marketed as}} a pheromone. <b>Oxytocin</b> in spray form is sold under the brands Attrakt and Connekt. <b>Oxytocin</b> is not {{absorbed into the}} skin when used topically, however it may be inhaled {{in a manner similar}} to perfume applied to skin. <b>Oxytocin</b> sprays for {{insufflation}} are also sold but often with little or no <b>oxytocin</b> at all.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxytocin</b> is {{typically}} remembered {{for the effect}} it has on prosocial behaviors, such as its role in facilitating trust and attachment between individuals. Consequently, <b>oxytocin</b> {{is often referred to}} as the “love hormone". However, <b>oxytocin</b> has a more complex role than solely enhancing prosocial behaviors. There is consensus that <b>oxytocin</b> modulates fear and anxiety; that is, it does not directly elicit fear or anxiety. Two dominant theories explain the role of <b>oxytocin</b> in fear and anxiety. One theory states that <b>oxytocin</b> increases approach/avoidance to certain social stimuli and the second theory states that <b>oxytocin</b> increases the salience of certain social stimuli, causing the animal or human to pay closer attention to socially relevant stimuli.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{learning}} and memory functions are impaired by centrally administered <b>oxytocin.</b> Also, systemic <b>oxytocin</b> administration can impair memory retrieval in certain aversive memory tasks. However, <b>oxytocin</b> {{does seem to}} facilitate {{learning and}} memory specifically for social information. Healthy males administered intranasal <b>oxytocin</b> show improved memory for human faces, in particular happy faces.|$|E
25|$|Nasally {{administered}} <b>oxytocin</b> {{has been}} reported to reduce fear, possibly by inhibiting the amygdala (which is thought to be responsible for fear responses). Indeed, studies in rodents have shown <b>oxytocin</b> can efficiently inhibit fear responses by activating an inhibitory circuit within the amygdala. Some researchers have argued <b>oxytocin</b> has a general enhancing effect on all social emotions, since intranasal administration of <b>oxytocin</b> also increases envy and Schadenfreude. Individuals who receive an intranasal dose of <b>oxytocin</b> identify facial expressions of disgust faster than individuals who do not receive <b>oxytocin.</b> Facial expressions of disgust are evolutionarily linked to the idea of contagion. Thus, <b>oxytocin</b> increases the salience of cues that imply contamination, which leads to a faster response because these cues are especially relevant for survival. In another study, after administration of <b>oxytocin,</b> individuals displayed an enhanced ability to recognize expressions of fear compared to the individuals who received the placebo. <b>Oxytocin</b> modulates fear responses by enhancing the maintenance of social memories. Rats that are genetically modified to have a surplus of <b>oxytocin</b> receptors display a greater fear response to a previously conditioned stressor. <b>Oxytocin</b> enhances the aversive social memory, leading the rat to display a greater fear response when the aversive stimulus is encountered again.|$|E
25|$|The {{peripheral}} {{actions of}} <b>oxytocin</b> mainly reflect secretion from the pituitary gland. The behavioral effects of <b>oxytocin</b> {{are thought to}} reflect release from centrally projecting <b>oxytocin</b> neurons, different from those that project to the pituitary gland, or that are collaterals from them. <b>Oxytocin</b> receptors are expressed by neurons {{in many parts of}} the brain and spinal cord, including the amygdala, ventromedial hypothalamus, septum, nucleus accumbens, and brainstem.|$|E
25|$|Addiction {{vulnerability}} Endogenous <b>oxytocin</b> {{can also}} impact on drug effects and susceptibility to develop Substance use disorder. Endogenous <b>oxytocin</b> concentrations can directly impact on drug effects. Additionally, bilateral interactions with numerous systems, including the dopamine system, Hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis and immune system, can impact on development of dependence. The {{status of the}} endogenous <b>oxytocin</b> system might enhance or reduce susceptibility to addiction through its interaction with these systems. Individual differences in the endogenous <b>oxytocin</b> system based on genetic predisposition, gender and environmental influences, may therefore affect addiction vulnerability. <b>Oxytocin</b> {{may be related to}} the place conditioning behaviors observed in habitual drug abusers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxytocin</b> has {{peripheral}} (hormonal) actions, {{and also}} has actions in the brain. Its actions are mediated by specific, <b>oxytocin</b> receptors. The <b>oxytocin</b> receptor is a G-protein-coupled receptor that requires magnesium and cholesterol. It belongs to the rhodopsin-type (class I) group of G-protein-coupled receptors.|$|E
25|$|It {{has also}} been shown that {{testosterone}} directly suppresses <b>oxytocin</b> in mice. This has been hypothesized to have evolutionary significance. With <b>oxytocin</b> suppressed, activities such as hunting and attacking invaders would be less mentally difficult as <b>oxytocin</b> is strongly associated with empathy.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} shown that <b>oxytocin</b> {{differentially}} affects males and females. Females who are administered <b>oxytocin</b> are overall faster in responding to socially relevant stimuli than males who received <b>oxytocin.</b> Additionally, after the administration of <b>oxytocin,</b> females show increased amygdala activity in response to threatening scenes; however, males do not show increased amygdala activation. This phenomenon can be explained by looking at the role of gonadal hormones, specifically estrogen, which modulate the enhanced threat processing seen in females. Estrogen {{has been shown}} to stimulate the release of <b>oxytocin</b> from the hypothalamus and promote receptor binding in the amygdala.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen {{has been}} found to {{increase}} the secretion of <b>oxytocin</b> and to increase the expression of its receptor, the <b>oxytocin</b> receptor, in the brain. In women, a single dose of estradiol {{has been found}} to be sufficient to increase circulating <b>oxytocin</b> concentrations.|$|E
25|$|Social {{behavior}} and wound healing: <b>Oxytocin</b> is also thought to modulate inflammation by decreasing certain cytokines. Thus, the increased release in <b>oxytocin</b> following positive social interactions {{has the potential}} to improve wound healing. A study by Marazziti and colleagues used heterosexual couples to investigate this possibility. They found increases in plasma <b>oxytocin</b> following a social interaction were correlated with faster wound healing. They hypothesized this was due to <b>oxytocin</b> reducing inflammation, thus allowing the wound to heal more quickly. This study provides preliminary evidence that positive social interactions may directly influence aspects of health. According to a study published in 2014, silencing of <b>oxytocin</b> receptor interneurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of female mice resulted in loss of social interest in male mice during the sexually receptive phase of the estrous cycle. <b>Oxytocin</b> evokes feelings of contentment, reductions in anxiety, and feelings of calmness and security when in the company of the mate. This suggests <b>oxytocin</b> may be important for the inhibition of the brain regions associated with behavioral control, fear, and anxiety, thus allowing orgasm to occur. Research has also demonstrated that <b>oxytocin</b> can decrease anxiety and protect against stress, particularly in combination with social support.|$|E
25|$|Cardiac effects: <b>Oxytocin</b> and <b>oxytocin</b> receptors {{are also}} found in the heart in some rodents, and the hormone {{may play a role in}} the {{embryonal}} development of the heart by promoting cardiomyocyte differentiation. However, the absence of either <b>oxytocin</b> or its receptor in knockout mice has not been reported to produce cardiac insufficiencies.|$|E
25|$|In the hypothalamus, <b>oxytocin</b> {{is made in}} magnocellular neurosecretory {{cells of}} the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, and is stored in Herring bodies at the axon {{terminals}} in the posterior pituitary. It is then released into the blood from the posterior lobe (neurohypophysis) of the pituitary gland. These axons (likely, but dendrites have not been ruled out) have collaterals that innervate neurons in the nucleus accumbens, a brain structure where <b>oxytocin</b> receptors are expressed. The endocrine effects of hormonal <b>oxytocin</b> and the cognitive or behavioral effects of <b>oxytocin</b> neuropeptides {{are thought to be}} coordinated through its common release through these collaterals. <b>Oxytocin</b> is also produced by some neurons in the paraventricular nucleus that project {{to other parts of the}} brain and to the spinal cord. Depending on the species, <b>oxytocin</b> receptor-expressing cells are located in other areas, including the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis.|$|E
25|$|Also a {{significant}} positive correlation between plasma <b>oxytocin</b> levels and RD personality dimension was found by researchers in New Zealand. Considerable evidence from animal studies has shown <b>oxytocin</b> {{to be involved in}} the processing of social information and the regulation of social affiliative behavior. Results from studies measuring plasma <b>oxytocin</b> levels in patients with a diagnosis of major depressive episode according to DSM III-R has shown decreased <b>oxytocin</b> levels in these patients and lower RD scores on the TCI, leading to an assumption that lower reward dependence leads to depression.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxytocin</b> is a peptide of nine {{amino acids}} (a nonapeptide) in the {{sequence}} cysteine-tyrosine-isoleucine-glutamine-asparagine-cysteine-proline-leucine-glycine-amide (Cys–Tyr–Ile–Gln–Asn–Cys–Pro–Leu–Gly–NH2, or CYIQNCPLG-NH2); its C-terminus has been converted to a primary amide and a disulfide bridge joins the cysteine moieties. <b>Oxytocin</b> has a molecular mass of 1007Da, and one international unit (IU) of <b>oxytocin</b> {{is the equivalent of}} about 2g of pure peptide.|$|E
25|$|The <b>oxytocin</b> peptide is {{synthesized}} as an inactive {{precursor protein}} from the OXT gene. This precursor protein {{also includes the}} <b>oxytocin</b> carrier protein neurophysin I. The inactive precursor protein is progressively hydrolyzed into smaller fragments (one of which is neurophysin I) via a series of enzymes. The last hydrolysis that releases the active <b>oxytocin</b> nonapeptide is catalyzed by peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase (PAM).|$|E
25|$|Uterine contraction: Important for {{cervical}} dilation before birth, <b>oxytocin</b> causes contractions {{during the}} second and third stages of labor. <b>Oxytocin</b> release during breastfeeding causes mild but often painful contractions during the first few weeks of lactation. This also serves to assist the uterus in clotting the placental attachment point postpartum. However, in knockout mice lacking the <b>oxytocin</b> receptor, reproductive behavior and parturition are normal.|$|E
25|$|Affecting {{generosity}} {{by increasing}} empathy during perspective taking: In a neuroeconomics experiment, intranasal <b>oxytocin</b> increased generosity in the Ultimatum Game by 80%, {{but had no}} effect in the Dictator Game that measures altruism. Perspective-taking is not required in the Dictator Game, but the researchers in this experiment explicitly induced perspective-taking in the Ultimatum Game by not identifying to participants into which role they would be placed. Serious methodological questions have arisen, however, {{with regard to the}} role of <b>oxytocin</b> in trust and generosity. Empathy in healthy males {{has been shown to be}} increased after intranasal <b>oxytocin</b> This is most likely due to the effect of <b>oxytocin</b> in enhancing eye gaze. There is some discussion about which aspect of empathy <b>oxytocin</b> might alter – for example, cognitive vs. emotional empathy.|$|E
25|$|Studies in autistic {{disorder}} and Asperger syndrome have shown results, where lower <b>oxytocin</b> levels and lower RD scores {{were reported in}} these children leading to their abnormal social behaviors. The direction of the effect i.e. whether reduced <b>oxytocin</b> leads to decreased affiliation or vice versa has not been clearly established. Recent animal studies would, however, suggest that changes to <b>oxytocin</b> lead to changes in behavior.|$|E
25|$|Nasal administration: <b>Oxytocin</b> is a peptide that is {{effectively}} {{distributed to the}} brain when administered intranasally via a nasal spray, after which it reliably crosses the blood–brain barrier and exhibits psychoactive effects in humans. No serious adverse effects with short-term application of <b>oxytocin</b> with 18~40nbsp&IU (36-80nbsp&mcg) have been recorded. Intranasal <b>oxytocin</b> has a central duration of at least 2.25nbsp&hours {{and as long as}} 4nbsp&hours.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxytocin</b> and {{vasopressin}} are {{the only}} known hormones released by the human posterior pituitary gland to act at a distance. However, <b>oxytocin</b> neurons make other peptides, including corticotropin-releasing hormone and dynorphin, for example, that act locally. The magnocellular neurosecretory cells that make <b>oxytocin</b> are adjacent to magnocellular neurosecretory cells that make vasopressin. These are large neuroendocrine neurons which are excitable and can generate action potentials.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxytocin</b> {{has long}} been used as the {{standard}} agent for labor induction, but does not work well when the cervix is not yet ripe. Misoprostol also {{may be used in}} conjunction with <b>oxytocin.</b>|$|E
25|$|Maternal behavior: Female rats given <b>oxytocin</b> antagonists {{after giving}} birth do not exhibit typical {{maternal}} behavior. By contrast, virgin female sheep show maternal behavior toward foreign lambs upon cerebrospinal fluid infusion of <b>oxytocin,</b> which they would not do otherwise. <b>Oxytocin</b> {{is involved in the}} initiation of maternal behavior, not its maintenance; for example, it is higher in mothers after they interact with unfamiliar children rather than their own.|$|E
25|$|Feeding: A 2012 paper {{suggested}} that <b>oxytocin</b> neurons in the para-ventricular hypothalamus {{in the brain}} may {{play a key role}} in suppressing appetite under normal conditions and that other hypothalamic neurons may trigger eating via inhibition of these <b>oxytocin</b> neurons. This population of <b>oxytocin</b> neurons are absent in Prader-Willi syndrome, a genetic disorder that leads to uncontrollable feeding and obesity, and may {{play a key role in}} its pathophysiology.|$|E
25|$|To {{help with}} breastfeeding: <b>Oxytocin</b> is {{sometimes}} prescribed for mothers to stimulate breast milk production {{to help with}} feeding their baby. However, women receiving intranasal <b>oxytocin</b> per day before breastfeeding produced only slightly more milk after two days.|$|E
25|$|Sexual activity: The {{relationship}} between <b>oxytocin</b> and human sexual response is unclear. At least two uncontrolled {{studies have found}} increases in plasma <b>oxytocin</b> at orgasm – in both men and women. Plasma <b>oxytocin</b> levels are notably increased {{around the time of}} self-stimulated orgasm and are still higher than baseline when measured five minutes after self arousal. The authors of one of these studies speculated that oxytocin's effects on muscle contractibility may facilitate sperm and egg transport.|$|E
25|$|To induce labor: An {{intravenous}} {{infusion of}} <b>oxytocin</b> {{is used to}} induce labor and to support labor in case of slow childbirth if the <b>Oxytocin</b> Challenge Test (OCT) fail. It is unclear whether a high dose {{is better than a}} standard dose for labor induction. It has largely replaced ergometrine as the principal agent to increase uterine tone in acute postpartum hemorrhage. <b>Oxytocin</b> is also used in veterinary medicine to facilitate birth and to stimulate milk release. The tocolytic agent atosiban (Tractocile) acts as an antagonist of <b>oxytocin</b> receptors; this drug is registered in many countries to suppress premature labor between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation. It has fewer side effects than drugs previously used for this purpose (ritodrine, salbutamol, and terbutaline).|$|E
25|$|Breastfeeding {{releases}} beneficial hormones {{into the}} mother's body. <b>Oxytocin</b> and prolactin hormones relax {{the mother and}} increase her nurturing response. This hormone release can help to enable sleep. Breastfeeding soon after birth increases the mother's <b>oxytocin</b> levels, making her uterus contract more quickly and reducing bleeding. Pitocin, a synthetic hormone {{used to make the}} uterus contract during and after labour, is structurally modelled on <b>oxytocin.</b> Syntocinon, another synthetic oxytocic, is commonly used in Australia and the UK rather than Pitocin.|$|E
25|$|Drug {{interaction}} Impact on {{effects of}} alcohol and other drugs: According to several studies in animals, <b>oxytocin</b> inhibits the development of tolerance to various addictive drugs (opiates, cocaine, alcohol), and reduces withdrawal symptoms. MDMA (ecstasy) may increase feelings of love, empathy, and connection to others by stimulating <b>oxytocin</b> activity primarily via activation of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, if initial studies in animals apply to humans. The anxiolytic Buspar (buspirone) may produce some of its effects via 5-HT1A receptor-induced <b>oxytocin</b> stimulation as well.|$|E
25|$|Milk {{ejection}} reflex/Letdown reflex: In lactating (breastfeeding) mothers, <b>oxytocin</b> acts at the mammary glands, causing milk to be 'let down' into subareolar sinuses, {{from where}} it can be excreted via the nipple. Suckling by the infant at the nipple is relayed by spinal nerves to the hypothalamus. The stimulation causes neurons that make <b>oxytocin</b> to fire action potentials in intermittent bursts; these bursts result in the secretion of pulses of <b>oxytocin</b> from the neurosecretory nerve terminals of the pituitary gland.|$|E
