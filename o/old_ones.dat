5|$|Compared to the 1st and 2nd centuries, the 3rd and 4th centuries saw {{much greater}} {{fortification}} activity, with many new forts built. Later Roman fortifications, both new and upgraded <b>old</b> <b>ones,</b> contained much stronger defensive features than their earlier counterparts. In addition, the late 3rd/4th centuries saw the fortification of many {{towns and cities}} including the City of Rome itself and its eastern sister, Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Ulceration episodes usually occur about 3–6 {{times per}} year. However, severe disease is {{characterized}} by virtually constant ulceration (new lesions developing before <b>old</b> <b>ones</b> have healed) and may cause debilitating chronic pain and interfere with comfortable eating. In severe cases, this prevents adequate nutrient intake leading to malnutrition and weight loss.|$|E
5|$|As a ceratopsid, Achelousaurus {{would have}} been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, {{downwards}} swept tail. Its very large head, which would have rested on a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual teeth. In the tooth sockets, new teeth grew under the <b>old</b> <b>ones,</b> each position housing a column of teeth posed on top of each other. Achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).|$|E

5|$|Controversy {{occurred}} at York Park when, {{in a game}} between St Kilda and Fremantle, the final siren was too quiet to be heard {{by any of the}} umpires; play was restarted in error, and in the subsequent confusion St Kilda levelled the scores. After a protest, the AFL Commission convened and overturned the result, awarding Fremantle the victory. The stadium's sirens have since been replaced, and the <b>old</b> <b>ones</b> will be put on display at the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery.|$|E
5|$|In the late-1930s it {{was decided}} to replace the pump and the centrepieces of the fountains. The new centrepieces, {{designed}} by Sir Edwin Lutyens, were memorials to Lord Jellicoe and Lord Beatty, although busts of the admirals, initially intended to be placed in the fountain surrounds were placed against the northern retaining wall when the project was completed after the Second World War. The fountains cost almost £50,000. The <b>old</b> <b>ones</b> were presented to the Canadian government and are now located in Ottawa's Confederation Park and Regina's Wascana Centre.|$|E
5|$|In this period, {{there has}} also been {{widespread}} cosmetic changes to stations, including the restoration of historical murals, the incorporation of new artwork and improving the lighting. The renovations on Line B have been met with criticism for destroying parts of the line's historical patrimony, which dates back to the 1930s. The appearance of the network's signage has also been changed and the new signs have been gradually replacing the <b>old</b> <b>ones</b> since November 2014.|$|E

5|$|Many foreign {{visitors}} to Iran {{of the time}} had commented on their pitiful situation. Traveller A.V.W. Jackson noted that Zoroastrians lived in constant fear of persecution by Muslim extremists and their lives were in danger whenever the fanatical spirit of Islam broke out, {{such as the one}} witnessed by him in Yazd. According to Edward Browne, the wall of Zoroastrian houses had to be lower than that of the Muslims and prohibited from marking their houses with distinctive signs. Zoroastrians were forbidden from erecting new houses and repairing <b>old</b> <b>ones.</b>|$|E
5|$|The emperor penguin's dark plumage fades {{to brown}} from November until February (the Antarctic summer), before the yearly moult in January and February. Moulting is rapid in this species {{compared}} with other birds, taking only around 34days.

New feathers then push out the <b>old</b> <b>ones</b> before finishing their growth.|$|E
5|$|Blood-C was {{designed}} to share only thematic similarities with earlier Blood projects. CLAMP was brought on board to both design the characters and help create the scenario. It featured several new elements to the Blood franchise, such as being primarily set within a high school environment. The Elder Bairns were inspired by the Great <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> from H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and modeled after traditional Japanese monsters. Its bloody violence, a stylistic choice following the series' themes, resulted in censorship in Japan and eventual blacklisting in China. The series has received mixed to positive reviews from journalists.|$|E

5|$|The bulk of {{information}} about Lōʻihi comes from dives made {{in response to the}} 1996 eruption. In a dive conducted almost immediately after seismic activity was reported, visibility was greatly reduced by high concentrations of displaced minerals and large floating mats of bacteria in the water. The bacteria that feed on the dissolved nutrients had already begun colonizing the new hydrothermal vents at Pele's Pit (formed from the collapse of the <b>old</b> <b>ones),</b> and may be indicators of the kinds of material ejected from the newly formed vents. They were carefully sampled for further analysis in a laboratory. An OBO briefly sat on the summit before a more permanent probe could be installed.|$|E

5|$|The {{origins of}} the {{survival}} horror game {{can be traced back}} to earlier horror fiction. Archetypes have been linked to the books of H. P. Lovecraft, which include investigative narratives, or journeys through the depths. Comparisons have been made between Lovecraft's Cthulhoid <b>Old</b> <b>Ones</b> and the boss encounters seen in many survival horror games. Themes of survival have also been traced to the slasher film subgenre, where the protagonist endures a confrontation with the ultimate antagonist. Another major influence on the genre is Japanese horror, including classical Noh theatre, the books of Edogawa Rampo, and Japanese cinema. The survival horror genre largely draws from both Western (mainly American) and Asian (mainly Japanese) traditions, with the Western approach to horror generally favouring action-oriented visceral horror while the Japanese approach tends to favour psychological horror.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the emperor}} held supreme power, he more often sought {{the advice of}} his cabinet and other ministers before making {{decisions}} and when revoking them. He often assembled leading officials for debates or discussions on policy, known as court conferences (tingyi 廷議). Various issues were debated at these gatherings, such as installment of new emperors, enfeoffment of nobles, the establishment of new ancestral temples, reforms to the state religion, the monetary or tax systems, management of government monopolies on salt and iron (when they existed during Western Han), the introduction of new laws or the repeal of <b>old</b> <b>ones,</b> complex lawsuits, or whether or not to declare war on a foreign country or accept peaceful negotiation. Although the emperor could reject the decisions reached by his court conference, he did so at the risk of alienating his leading ministers. More often than not, he was forced to accept the majority consensus of his ministers, whose individual opinions were equally tallied regardless of their standing or salary-rank.|$|E
5|$|Cracks are linear {{openings}} {{that form}} in materials to relieve stress. When an elastic material stretches or shrinks uniformly, it eventually reaches its breaking strength and then fails suddenly in all directions, creating cracks with 120 degree joints, so three cracks {{meet at a}} node. Conversely, when an inelastic material fails, straight cracks form to relieve the stress. Further stress {{in the same direction}} would then simply open the existing cracks; stress at right angles can create new cracks, at 90 degrees to the <b>old</b> <b>ones.</b> Thus the pattern of cracks indicates whether the material is elastic or not. In a tough fibrous material like oak tree bark, cracks form to relieve stress as usual, but they do not grow long as their growth is interrupted by bundles of strong elastic fibres. Since each species of tree has its own structure at the levels of cell and of molecules, each has its own pattern of splitting in its bark.|$|E

5|$|Elephants {{usually have}} 26 teeth: the incisors, {{known as the}} tusks, 12 {{deciduous}} premolars, and 12 molars. Unlike most mammals, which grow baby teeth and then replace them with a single permanent set of adult teeth, elephants are polyphyodonts that have cycles of tooth rotation throughout their lives. The chewing teeth are replaced six times in a typical elephant's lifetime. Teeth are not replaced by new ones emerging from the jaws vertically as in most mammals. Instead, new teeth grow in {{at the back of}} the mouth and move forward to push out the <b>old</b> <b>ones.</b> The first chewing tooth on each side of the jaw falls out when the elephant is two to three years old. The second set of chewing teeth falls out when the elephant is four to six years old. The third set is lost at 9–15 years of age, and set four lasts until 18–28 years of age. The fifth set of teeth lasts until the elephant is in its early 40s. The sixth (and usually final) set must last the elephant the rest of its life. Elephant teeth have loop-shaped dental ridges, which are thicker and more diamond-shaped in African elephants.|$|E

Following Prue's death and the closure of the portals, Kyra initially plans to leave, but Ben convinces her to help the students of Knox Academy, a school for magic. Prue, while {{under the influence of the}} Old One Heremus, had previously attacked the campus and turned the students and faculty into hosts for demons.|$|E
5|$|Many actin-related {{molecules}} {{create a}} free barbed end for polymerization by uncapping or severing pre-existing filaments and using these as actin nucleation cores. However, the Arp2/3 complex stimulates actin polymerization {{by creating a}} new nucleation core. Actin nucleation is an initial step {{in the formation of}} an actin filament. The nucleation core activity of Arp2/3 is activated by members of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family protein (WASP, N-WASP, WAVE, and WASH proteins). The V domain of a WASP protein interacts with actin monomers while the CA region associates with the Arp2/3 complex to create a nucleation core. However, de novo nucleation followed by polymerization is not sufficient to form integrated actin networks, since these newly synthesized polymers would not be associated with pre-existing filaments. Thus, the Arp2/3 complex binds to pre-existing filaments so that the new filaments can grow on the <b>old</b> <b>ones</b> and form a functional actin cytoskeleton. Capping proteins limit actin polymerization to the region activated by the Arp2/3 complex, and the elongated filament ends are recapped to prevent depolymerization and thus conserve the actin filament.|$|E
