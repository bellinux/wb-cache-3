25|$|Not many Michelia {{species have}} so far become horticulturally or {{economically}} important, apart for their wood. Both subgenus Magnolia and subgenus Yulania include species of major horticultural importance, and a change of name would be very undesirable for many people, especially in the horticultural branch. In Europe, Magnolia even {{is more or less}} a synonym for Yulania, since most of the cultivated species <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>continent</b> have Magnolia (Yulania) denudata as one of their parents. Most taxonomists who acknowledge close relations between Yulania and Michelia therefore support the third option and join Michelia with Magnolia.|$|E
25|$|Numerous Paleoindian {{cultures}} occupied North America, {{with some}} arrayed around the Great Plains and Great Lakes {{of the modern}} United States of America and Canada, as well as adjacent areas to the West and Southwest. According to the oral histories {{of many of the}} indigenous peoples of the Americas, they have been living <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>continent</b> since their genesis, described by a wide range of traditional creation stories. Other tribes have stories that recount migrations across long tracts of land and a great river, believed to be the Mississippi River. Genetic and linguistic data connect the indigenous people of this continent with ancient northeast Asians. Archeological and linguistic data has enabled scholars to discover some of the migrations within the Americas.|$|E
500|$|Like Daniel Webster, James Wilson, and Joseph Story before him, Lincoln {{argued that}} the Declaration of Independence was a {{founding}} document of the United States, and that this had important implications for interpreting the Constitution, which had been ratified {{more than a decade}} after the Declaration. The Constitution did not use the word [...] "equality", yet Lincoln believed that the concept that [...] "all men are created equal" [...] remained a part of the nation's founding principles. He famously expressed this belief in the opening sentence of his 1863 Gettysburg Address: [...] "Four score and seven years ago [...] our fathers brought forth <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>continent,</b> a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition {{that all men are created}} equal." ...|$|E

500|$|The tension over Nicaragua soon abated, but the May 1895 {{death of}} Secretary Gresham, who like Bayard had favored {{cooperation}} with the British, led to increased disagreement over the Venezuela issue. [...] Cleveland appointed Richard Olney {{to take over the}} State Department, and Olney soon proved more confrontational than his predecessor. [...] Olney's opinion, soon adopted by Cleveland, was that the Monroe Doctrine not only prohibited new European colonies, but also declared an American national interest in any matter of substance within the hemisphere. [...] Olney drafted a long dispatch {{on the history of the}} problem, declaring that [...] "to-day the United States is practically sovereign <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>continent,</b> and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition..."

500|$|In July 1895 new Secretary of State Richard Olney (succeeding Gresham, {{who died}} in office {{at the end of}} May) sent a {{document}} to London which became known as [...] "Olney's twenty-inch gun" [...] (the draft was 12,000 words long). The note reviewed the history of the Anglo-Venezuelan dispute and of the Monroe Doctrine, and it firmly insisted on the application of the Doctrine to the case, declaring that [...] "today the United States is practically sovereign <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>continent,</b> and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition." [...] At this point the President and the Secretary of State as well as the US public [...] "had been brought to believe that Britain was in the wrong, that the vital interests of the United States were involved, and the United States must intervene." [...] The note had little impact on the British Government, partly because Joseph Chamberlain, at the Colonial Office, thought it possible that the colony had a major gold-bearing region around the Schomburgk line, and partly because the Government rejected the idea that the Monroe Doctrine had any relevance for the boundary dispute. A reply to Olney's note directly challenged his interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine, declaring that ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{honestly}} thought after Ligonier that we {{were beginning}} {{a new era of}} cooperation and Orthodox unity <b>on</b> <b>this</b> <b>continent.</b> For {{the first time since the}} early years of our presence in the Americas, it seemed there was a common vision, or at least a common goal of working together, not just for the sake of working together, but toward a canonically proper end of a unified Church. For me, the chance to sit down with brother bishops, many of whom I had never met, was a great and awesome experience. What made this experience great and awesome, besides just getting [...] together, was that [...] there was a purpose. Often we had gotten together in the past, but just for social purposes or anniversaries, celebrations, etc. This time it was for the good of the Church.
