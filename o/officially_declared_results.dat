5000|$|For {{the local}} {{government}} elections held on 7 May 1989 a number of East German opposition groups co-ordinated their activities to evaluate {{the fairness of the}} process, through simple observation at the polling stations and counting. The implausibility of reported election results in East Germany was nothing new, but the mood of openness openness and the increase in citizen dissatisfaction with the system supported a move to identify and publicise what was done. Although observation and analysis took place across the country, the election monitoring undertaken by citizens in the Berlin quarter of Weißensee was particularly detailed, due in part to Evelyn Zupke's careful organisation of it and in part to the number of people participating in the exercise. In contrast to other towns and districts, in Weißensee there were observers at virtually every polling station. Of the 66 polling stations only one operated unobserved. [...] This was the polling station at the prestigious Weißensee Arts Academy where, as Zupke later observed, the opposition groups had no contacts. [...] "Students did not belong to the opposition circles" [...] ("Studenten gehörten nicht zum oppositionellen Milieu."). [...] Elections in the German Democratic Republic were organised according to a [...] "Single list" [...] system. Voters were given a piece of paper listing the officially approved candidates and could endorse it by placing their voting slip in the appropriate ballot box. For voters not wishing to endorse the candidates listed there was a separate ballot box {{at the far end of}} the polling station. This was intended to discourage people from voting the wrong way, but it also made it relatively easy for observers to count the votes, independently of any <b>officially</b> <b>declared</b> <b>results.</b> In Zupke's apartment there was a parallel counting station operated by the Peace Circle. [...] Actual results were communicated by the opposition groups to western media, as a result of which the election details were reported widely in West Germany.|$|E
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{problems}} of radiological and economic efficiency of decontamination procedures as a measure of eliminating radioactive contamination in scarcely populated residential areas of Fukushima Prefecture (Japan). The objective of the research was to identify and compare with <b>officially</b> <b>declared</b> <b>results</b> the real effects of the decontamination measures on improving the radiation situation and reducing radiation doses for the population in Fukushima region. There was another objective of estimating the expected decontamination expenditure for these territories and the economic efficiency of this measure in accordance with the official international recommendations. The results of such kind of survey for Japan and actual values of the prevented doses due to the decontamination have not been published before. The key objective of this research was to assess the need for decontamination in sparsely populated areas of Fukushima Prefecture taking into account relatively low radiation background in these areas and significant associated financial losses. The initial data for the research have been taken from the Environment Ministry (Japan) reports on the restoration progress in the NPP area. The data on the current radiation situation in Japan have been taken from the Japan Nuclear Regulatory Commission Internet publications. A mathematical modeling of the radiation situation in remediation territories near Fukushima- 1 NPP was carried out in the research taking into account the simultaneous impact of several natural and anthropogenic factors. This mathematical model is described in the article. Some empirical dependencies obtained after the Chernobyl accident were also used in it. As the results of the research, the estimated values of actual, predicted and prevented by the decontamination and the resettlement measures doses to residents in one specific Fukushima prefecture municipality were presented. The total and average financial costs per unit of prevented exposure dose for different emergency measures scenarios were estimated, including longterm and short-term evacuation and decontamination. The estimated values of the decontamination and the resettlement effectiveness were presented based on the comparison of the public costs and benefits. The author goes on argue that radiological effectiveness of the decontamination measures was very low. He noted that the measures were inconsistent with the principles of cost optimization in the world radiation protection standards. However, at the same time, the decontamination measures made it possible to prevent possible high costs to the government, and some positive social effects were finally achieved. </p...|$|E
50|$|These {{results were}} disputed by Col. Chardigny, the Chief of the Military Inter-Allied Commission of Control sent by League of Nations, who <b>officially</b> <b>declared</b> that <b>results</b> are not valid, {{as most of}} the Lithuanians, Jews and Belarusians boycotted the elections, and there was use of {{military}} force. As a result of electoral malpractice such as not asking for a valid voter identification, noted by delegates from the League of Nations, the elections were not recognized. On 13 January 1922 the Council of the League of Nations issued a statement that the elected parliament was not a legal representative of the local population.|$|R
50|$|Under the {{provisions}} of the Referendum Act 1975 there was a total of 68 counting areas across the United Kingdom in which counting took place locally. Once the counting areas had <b>officially</b> <b>declared,</b> their <b>results</b> were then relayed by the returning officers to the Chief counting officer Sir Philip Allen who later <b>declared</b> the final <b>result,</b> In England there was a total of 47 counting areas which were made up of the then county council areas of England along with Greater London and the Isles of Scilly. In Wales there was just 8 counting areas which were also made up by the then county council areas. In Scotland the then 12 administrative regions were used as the counting areas with Northern Ireland acting as a single counting area. This meant that of the counting areas the Isles of Silly with 1,447 eligible voters had the smallest electorate and was also the smallest geographically and Greater London with 5,250,343 eligible voters had the largest electorate and Highland in northern Scotland was the largest geographically with 127,925 eligible voters.|$|R
50|$|Tyson was {{the aggressor}} for {{nearly the entire}} fight, {{constantly}} getting the better of Thomas with his power punches. Tyson was nearly {{able to get the}} victory in the first round. With about 40 seconds left in the round, Tyson staggered Thomas with a left hook-right hook combination. With Thomas' back now against the ropes, Tyson delivered an 8-punch combination in an attempt to get the knockout victory, but Thomas was able withstand Tyson's assault and survived the round without being knocked down. Thomas was able to rebound and last another four full rounds with Tyson, using his left jab to keep Tyson off-stride while clinching Tyson whenever Tyson came close. The fight would come to an end with a minute remaining in round 6. 30 seconds into the second minute, Tyson was able to catch Thomas with a left hook that clearly hurt the challenger. Tyson would follow this with a relentless 15-punch combination that dropped Thomas to the canvas {{for the first time in}} his professional career. Before referee Carlos Padilla, Jr. could reach the count of 10, Thomas' trainer Angelo Dundee entered the ring causing Padilla to stop the fight and <b>officially</b> <b>declare</b> the <b>result</b> a technical knockout victory for Tyson.|$|R
