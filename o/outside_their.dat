5|$|There {{are also}} social {{differences}} {{between males and}} females. Females typically have many affiliates and bond strongly with other females both within and <b>outside</b> <b>their</b> core areas, but do not affiliate with individuals outside the community range, except during mating season. Males, on the other hand, are more solitary, interact with {{only a couple of}} conspecifics, have weak social bonds with other males, and rarely associate with others <b>outside</b> <b>their</b> core group. Furthermore, field studies suggest that only females play a role in communal home range defense. Males may scent-mark and remain relatively silent, but otherwise show little involvement during disputes.|$|E
5|$|After BC {{became a}} Canadian {{province}} in 1871, Crease devoted {{the next few}} years to fighting for judicial independence—specifically the right of judges to live <b>outside</b> <b>their</b> districts. In 1881 the BC Supreme Court, including Crease, ruled in the Thrasher case that the province's attempts to regulate judges were unconstitutional. This decision was overturned two years later by the Supreme Court of Canada.|$|E

5|$|China before westernization {{was another}} society that {{segregated}} men from women.

5|$|In fact, {{during the}} 1950s, many {{families}} would intentionally hang gandingans <b>outside</b> <b>their</b> houses so other neighbors could easily hear them play.

5|$|After {{four and}} a half months of {{research}} in Spain, Littleton visited the site of his war-time service in Naples. He was surprised to find seven small glass factories there. On a later visit to the island of Murano, he visited more than fifty glass factories. He was fascinated by the little demonstration furnaces that some of the factories placed <b>outside</b> <b>their</b> walls. The furnaces would be staffed by a couple of the factory's glassblowers, who would perform their craft for tourists. His meeting with Sala and his Murano experiences stimulated his interest in making glass art in a private studio.|$|E
5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight avoidance. These rodents forage {{in relatively}} open habitats and reduce their activity <b>outside</b> <b>their</b> nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E
5|$|California {{sea lions}} have a {{polygynous}} breeding pattern. From May to August, males establish territories {{and try to}} attract females with which to mate. Females are free to move in between territories, and are not coerced by males. Mothers nurse their pups in between foraging trips. Sea lions communicate with numerous vocalizations, notably with barks and mother-pup contact calls. <b>Outside</b> <b>their</b> breeding season, sea lions {{spend much of their}} time at sea, but they come to shore to molt.|$|E

5|$|Do-Ashiayana Manzil was a {{portable}} wooden house {{used by the}} Mughal emperors during their visits <b>outside</b> <b>their</b> capital. This was a double storied house built with a platform supported over 16 pillars, of 6 yards height. Pillars were 4 cubits in height joined with nuts and bolts which formed the upper floor. This functioned as a sleeping quarter for the king and also for worship and holding Jharokha Darshan, and considered it an emulation of Hindu practice.|$|E
5|$|Following the arming of the Italian ironclads Duilio and Dandolo with 100-ton guns, the British feared an Italian {{attack on}} Malta, as the ships could fire on Malta's batteries, {{destroying}} them {{one after the}} other, while keeping <b>outside</b> <b>their</b> guns' range. To prevent this, the British requested that four 100-ton guns be built. Two of these were installed in Malta, and Cambridge Battery and Rinella Battery were built specifically to house these guns. Construction of the batteries began in 1878 and they were complete by 1886. The gun at Rinella still exists.|$|E

5|$|In April 1942, the German Commanding General in Serbia, General der Artillerie (General) Paul Bader, issued orders giving unit numbers C39 to C101 to the Pećanac Chetnik detachments, {{which were}} put {{under the command}} of the local German {{division}} or area command post. These orders also required the deployment of a German liaison officer with all detachments engaged in operations, and limited their movement <b>outside</b> <b>their</b> assigned area. Supply of arms and ammunition was also controlled. In July 1942, Mihailović arranged for the Yugoslav government-in-exile to denounce Pećanac as a traitor. His continuing collaboration ruined what remained of the reputation he had developed in the Balkan Wars and World War I.|$|E
5|$|Judges in a High Court are {{appointed}} by the President of India {{in consultation with the}} Chief Justice of India and the governor of the state. High Courts are headed by a Chief Justice. The Chief Justices are ranked fourteenth (in their state) and seventeenth (<b>outside</b> <b>their</b> state) in the Indian order of precedence. The number of judges in a court is decided by dividing the average institution of main cases during the last five years by the national average, or the average rate of disposal of main cases per judge per year in that High Court, whichever is higher.|$|E

This means that the person {{on top of the}} list will get the seat unless the voter alters the ballot.

40|$|There is no {{question}} that divorce is prevalent in our society today. This paper discussed a study about the effects divorce has on an adolescent girl 2 ̆ 7 s communication with adults outside of her family. The hypothesis was that divorce negatively effects a child 2 ̆ 7 s communication with adults <b>outside</b> of <b>their</b> family. The two methodologies used to conduct this study were Narrative Analysis and Q-sort. The ten participants for the Narrative Analysis method were asked whether they thought their parents divorce effected their communication with adults <b>outside</b> of <b>their</b> family, and whether the effect was negative or positive. They were also asked to give examples of their communication in relationships they had with adults <b>outside</b> of <b>their</b> family. From these ten narratives a Q-sort statement sheet was developed containing thirty statements stated from the Narrative Analysis. The twenty participants that participated in the Q-sort method ordered the thirty statements from what they saw to be most true to least true based on their personal experience in communicating with adults <b>outside</b> of <b>their</b> family after divorce. This study concluded that divorce does in fact effect a child 2 ̆ 7 s communication with adults <b>outside</b> of <b>their</b> family; however, whether or not those effects are positive or negative were questionable according to the participants in this study. Recommendations for future research are discussed...|$|R
