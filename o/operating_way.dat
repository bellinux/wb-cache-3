When a refuge chamber is in refuge state, carbon dioxide scrubbing is an important function of the environmental control system in chamber.

30|$|Sometimes the BMC {{abattoir}} {{can only}} absorb {{a fraction of}} cattle at a time, <b>operating</b> <b>way</b> below its full capacity. This quota limits the number of animals farmers can offload, and thus, it becomes even more costly to transport very few animals to Lobatse instead of a truck full of cattle to capitalize on economies of scale and maximize returns. Further compounding this problem for transport owners is the limited amount/absence of goods to carry back to pastoral areas after offloading cattle at the abattoir instead of trucks returning empty. This situation in turn hurts the BMC, as it becomes less efficient {{and in the process}} incurs high overhead costs per unit of throughput due to low supply of slaughter animals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{years have}} shown a growing {{interest}} {{in the concept of}} cognitive radios (CR), able to access portions of the electromagnetic spectrum in an opportunistic <b>operating</b> <b>way.</b> Such systems require efficient detectors able to work in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments, with little or no information about the signals they are trying to detect. Energy detectors are wildly used to perform such blind detection tasks, but quickly reach the so-called SNR wall below which detection becomes impossible. Cyclostationarity detectors are an interesting alternative to energy detectors, as they exploit hidden periodicities present in man-made signals, but absent in noise. Such detectors use quadratic transformations of the signals to extract the hidden sine-waves. While most of the literature focuses on the second-order transformations of the signals, we investigate the potential of higher-order transformations of the signals. Using the theory of higher-order cyclostationarity (HOCS), we derive a fourth-order detector that performs similarly to the secondorder ones, while being less complex. Performance comparisons between fourth-order, second-order and energy detectors have been performed through simulations to demonstrate the interest of the fourth-order detector. I...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we would like}} to present a {{possible}} <b>operating</b> <b>way</b> to survey and model a very complex architecture, integrating different kinds of instrumentation and modeling methods. In particular {{we would like to}} convoy the attention on a possible measure and data elaboration procedure that allows collecting and post-elaborating data in a short time in order to both extract classical architectural products, such as sections and profiles, and to build complete and accurate 3 D models. The necessity is to structure multi-data source procedure buds inside a five years project (still in progress) with the goal to survey and three-dimensionally model the Main Spire of Milan Cathedral. It is a very complex “object ” and, for this reason, it can be considered a very challanging and useful test field for the new 3 D survey technologies and, in particular, for the various “real-based ” modeling methodologies. In the paper are described the survey workflow and the relative elaboration steps, focusing on the problems and justifying the key choices. 1. 1 The study case 1...|$|E
30|$|Recent {{years have}} shown a growing {{interest}} {{in the concept of}} Cognitive Radios (CRs), able to access portions of the electromagnetic spectrum in an opportunistic <b>operating</b> <b>way.</b> Such systems require efficient detectors able to work in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) environments, with little or no information about the signals they are trying to detect. Energy detectors are widely used to perform such blind detection tasks, but quickly reach the so-called SNR wall below which detection becomes impossible Tandra (2005). Cyclostationarity detectors are an interesting alternative to energy detectors, as they exploit hidden periodicities present in man-made signals, but absent in noise. Such detectors use quadratic transformations of the signals to extract the hidden sine-waves. While most of the literature focuses on the second-order transformations of the signals, we investigate the potential of higher-order transformations of the signals. Using the theory of Higher-Order Cyclostationarity (HOCS), we derive a fourth-order detector that performs similarly to the second-order ones to detect linearly modulated signals, at SNR around 0 dB, which may be used if the signals of interest do not exhibit second-order cyclostationarity. More generally this paper reviews the relevant aspects of the cyclostationary and HOCS theory, and shows their potential for spectrum sensing.|$|E

40|$|Após considerações iniciais sobre inteligência, um estudo comparativo entre inteligência biológica e inteligência {{artificial}} é feito. Os especialistas em Inteligência Artificial são de opinião que inteligência é simplesmente uma matéria de manipulação de símbolos físicos. Neste sentido, o objetivo da Inteligência Artificial é entender como a inteligência cerebral funciona em termos de conceitos e técnicas de engenharia. De modo diverso os filósofos da ciência acreditam que os computadores podem ter uma sintaxe, porém não têm uma semântica. No presente trabalho é ressaltado que o complexo cérebro/mente constitui um sistema monolítico, que funciona com funções emergentes em vários níveis de organização hierárquica. Esses níveis hierárquicos não são redutíveis um ao outro. Eles são, no mínimo, três (neuronal, funcional e semântico) e funcionam dentro de um plano interacional. Do ponto de vista epistemológico, o complexo cérebro/mente se utiliza de mecanismos lógicos e não-lógicos para lidar com os problemas do dia-a-dia. A lógica é necessária para o processo do pensamento, porém não é suficiente. Ênfase é dada aos mecanismos não-lógicos (lógica nebulosa, heurística, raciocínio intuitivo), os quais permitem à mente desenvolver estratégias para encontrar soluções. After brief considerations about intelligence, {{a comparative}} study between biologic and artificial intelligence is made. The specialists in Artificial Intelligence found that intelligence is purely {{a matter of}} physical symbol manipulation. The enterprise of Artificial Intelligence aims to understand {{what we might call}} Brain Intelligence in terms of concepts and techniques of engineering. However the philosophers believed that computer-machine can have syntax, but can never have semantics. In other words, that they can follow rules, such as those of arithmetic or grammar, but not understand what to us are meanings of symbols, such as words. In the present paper it is stressed that brain/mind complex constitutes a monolithic system that functions with emergent properties at several levels of hierarchical organization. These hierarchical levels are non-reducible to one another. They are at least three (neuronal, functional, and semantic), and they function within an interactional plan. The brain/ mind complex, which transform informations in meanings, deals with problems by means of both logical and non-logical mechanisms; while logic allows the mind to arrange the elements for reasoning, the non-logical mechanisms (fuzzy logic, heuristics, insights) allows the mind to develop strategies to find solutions. The model for construction of the "intelligent machine" is the <b>operating</b> <b>way</b> of the brain/mind complex, which does not always use logical processes. The role of information science in Artificial Intelligence is to search for knowledge itself (virtual knowledge), rather than to simply attempt a logico-mathematical formalization of knowledge...|$|E
