25|$|The {{design of}} the Bretton Woods System was that nations could only enforce gold {{convertibility}} on the anchor currency—the United States' dollar. Gold convertibility enforcement was not required, but instead, allowed. Nations could forgo converting dollars to gold, and instead hold dollars. Rather than full convertibility, it provided a fixed price for sales between central banks. However, there was still an open gold market. For the Bretton Woods system to remain workable, it would either have to alter the peg of the dollar to gold, or {{it would have to}} maintain the free market price for gold near the $35 per ounce <b>official</b> <b>price.</b> The greater the gap between free market gold prices and central bank gold prices, the greater the temptation to deal with internal economic issues by buying gold at the Bretton Woods price and selling it on the open market.|$|E
50|$|Long An Province {{implemented}} price reforms under Chinh's {{leadership in}} 1977. The province {{bought and sold}} sugar and peanuts at prices higher than the <b>official</b> <b>prices,</b> thereby giving farmers an incentive to sell and increasing the quantity available for sale (farmers were previously unwilling to sell at the low <b>official</b> <b>prices).</b> The surplus purchased was not sold on to the central state to avoid losses (selling at <b>official</b> <b>prices</b> after buying at higher prices), but to a trading company in Ho Chi Minh City that in return provided the province with consumption goods that {{would otherwise have been}} distributed by the central state. This was a violation of rules and the provincial leadership was ordered to discontinue the practice.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a planned-economy monetary model of China. A money supply equation links changes in broad money to government transactions evaluated at <b>official</b> <b>prices.</b> The demand for real money balances by consumers equals the nominal {{demand for money}} deflated by an unobserved true price index. The model explains money demand as the divergence between the then <b>official</b> and true <b>price</b> indices. Changes in the money supply are explained by government transactions, while money demand is explained by real income and the anticipated true rate of inflation. The true rate of inflation is 2. 5 times the official rate. Copyright 1987 by Ohio State University Press. ...|$|R

50|$|The Baltic states housing bubble is an {{economic}} bubble involving major cities in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. The Baltic States had enjoyed a relatively strong economic growth between 2000 and 2006, and the real estate sectors had performed well since 2000.

50|$|Under the new dual structure, OPEC {{was neither}} {{vertically}} or horizontally integrated {{and was not}} able to take over the entire oil sector from the oil companies. The temporary fear of an oil shortage during the 1970s helped to hide this consequence. In addition, relations between producing countries of the Persian Gulf and previous concessionary companies induced an “artificial” vertical integration. These relations included long-term contracts, discount of <b>official</b> <b>prices,</b> and phase-out clauses. Free markets started to become prevalent in 1981 after the trade in oil switched from being a sellers’ to a buyers’ market.|$|R

The crisis peaked in 1990 when the first measures of an IMF structural adjustment program were carried out. While the program was not fully implemented before the war, key measures such as two large devaluations and the removal of <b>official</b> <b>prices</b> were enacted. The consequences on salaries and purchasing power were rapid and dramatic.

40|$|It is {{not unusual}} for {{reforming}} socialist economies to relax wage controls without hardening budget constraints on enterprises or freeing consumer goods prices. This policy can be dangerously destabilizing. While higher wages permit workers to purchase more of some goods, they also tend to exacerbate shortages and to breed waste and corruption. Beyond a certain level, economywide wage hikes will worsen worker welfare, regardless of whether deficit goods are strictly rationed, sold randomly at <b>official</b> <b>prices</b> to queuing workers, or offered to workers by "insiders" only at black-market prices. However, the form of allocation does influence the levels of output and welfare. Copyright 1992 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|R
