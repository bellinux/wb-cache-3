5|$|The {{flooding}} {{caused by}} Irene damaged more than 471,000acres (1,900km²) of sugar cane and 39,000acres (158km²) <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> plantations. Irene's rainfall also flooded tobacco fields. Throughout the country, Irene's rainfall damaged 27,336houses and caused the total loss of 730. 13hospitals were also affected to some extent. 154sectors of Havana lost power {{due to the}} storm.

5|$|After {{weakening}} to {{a tropical}} depression on November23, Marco re-strengthened to {{a tropical storm}} on the following day. Marco tracked northwestward while fluctuating in intensity before finally weakening and dissipating on November26. Despite not making landfall, Marco produced heavy rainfall in Cuba, Hispaniola, Central America, and Jamaica, which caused significant flooding in some areas. In Honduras, 4,000homes were destroyed, 40bridges washed away, nearly 50,000acres <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> and fruit plantations flooded, and nine deaths were reported. Flooding also effected other Central American countries, albeit effects were less severe. Heavy rainfall was reported in Cuba, although flood damage is unknown. Marco contributed to an ongoing flood in Jamaica and caused three additional fatalities in the Dominican Republic. Overall, Marco caused 15fatalities and approximately $8.2million (1996USD) in damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{implications}} of crop diversity are at {{both local and}} world levels. Global organizations that aim to support diversity include Bioversity International (formerly known as International Plant Genetic Resources Institute), the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative, and the International Network for Improvement <b>of</b> <b>Banana</b> and Plantain. Members of the United Nations, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development 2002 at Johannesburg, said that crop diversity {{is in danger of}} being lost if measures are not taken. One such step taken in the action against the loss of biodiversity among crops is gene banking. There are a number of organizations that enlist teams of local farmers to grow native varieties, particularly those that are threatened by extinction due to lack of modern-day use. There are also local, national and international efforts to preserve agricultural genetic resources through off-site methods such as seed and sperm banks for further research and crop breeding.|$|E
30|$|Determining banana’s {{ripening}} stages {{is becoming}} an essential requirement for standardizing the quality <b>of</b> commercial <b>bananas.</b> In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network architecture which is designed specifically for the fine-grained classification <b>of</b> <b>banana’s</b> ripening stages. It learns a set of fine-grained image features based on a data-driven mechanism and offers a deep indicator <b>of</b> <b>banana’s</b> ripening stage. The resulted indicator can help to differentiate the subtle differences among subordinate classes <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> in ripening state. Experimental results from 17, 312 images <b>of</b> <b>bananas</b> in different ripening stages show that our deep indicator achieves an accuracy superior significantly to state-of-the-art computer vision-based systems both in rough- and fine-grained classification of ripening stages no matter the bananas bear or not severe defects.|$|R

5|$|The outer rainbands of {{the storm}} first began {{affecting}} Guatemala and southeastern Mexico late on June 1. In Mexico, the peak 24-hour rainfall total was 4.96inches (126mm) in Huixtla, and across southeastern Mexico, the rainfall led to above normal levels in many rivers. An automatic surface station in Puerto Madero, Mexico recorded sustained winds of 36mph (58km/h) with gusts of 53mph (85km/h) shortly after landfall. In most locations, damage from the storm was minor, limited to downed light posts, some damaged roofs, and a brief power outage. However, winds and rains from the storm caused moderate to severe crop damage in the mountain range of southern Chiapas. About 35sq.miles (90km²) <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> crops were destroyed, with about 4sq.miles (10km²) of coffee damaged. The passage {{of the storm}} also resulted in damage to cocoa beans, mango, coconut, and other vegetables, with crop damage totaling about 200million pesos (2007MXN, $55million 2007USD). As {{a result of the}} crop damage, the government of Mexico provided 108million pesos (2007MXN, $10million 2007USD) in financial aid to the affected farmers.|$|E
5|$|The storm dropped heavy {{rainfall}} while crossing the Lesser Antilles. In Martinique, the highest 24‑hour total was 26.8inches (680mm) in Fourniols, which was twice the average rainfall for August. Additionally, {{the capital city}} of Fort-de-France reported 13.4in (341mm). There, the rainfall broke all records for durations up to 24hours; about 1inch (26mm) fell in 5minutes, and in one hour a station reported 6.02inches (153mm). The rainfall caused flooding and mudslides, as well as rivers exceeding their banks; several bridges collapsed during the storm, and many homes were washed away. During the passage of the storm, sustained winds on the island reached 67mph (108km/h), with gusts reaching 99mph (160km/h) in the Caravelle peninsula. Throughout the country, the storm destroyed 186homes and left 700people homeless. The passage of Dorothy left heavy crop damage on the island, totaling 32millionfrancs (1970FRF, $5.8million 1970USD); a total of 3.75mi² (9.72km²) <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> crop was destroyed, and 2.16mi² (5.6km²) of sugar cane was destroyed. Damage on the island totaled 190millionfrancs (1970FRF, $34million 1970USD).|$|E
5|$|This system {{developed}} as a tropical depression just offshore {{the west coast of}} Africa on September6. The depression strengthened into a tropical storm later that day, shortly before passing south of the Cape Verde Islands. Further intensification was slow and halted by late on September7. However, about 48hours later, the storm resumed strengthening and became a Category1 hurricane on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Still moving westward, the system reached Category4 intensity before striking Guadeloupe on September12. There, the storm brought 1,200deaths and extensive damage, including the destruction of approximately 85%–95% <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> crops, the severe damage dealt to 70%–80% of tree crops, and the roughly 40% of the sugar cane crops ruined. Martinique, Montserrat, and Nevis also reported damage and fatalities, but the impacts at those locations were not nearly as severe as in Guadeloupe.|$|E

Along the Caribbean coastline of Honduras, about 1,000shanty houses were destroyed. Overall, Marco caused nine fatalities in the country. In the Pacific and northern regions of Nicaragua, numerous houses washed away in the floods. In addition, Nicaraguan civil defense authorities reported two fatalities. Further north in Guatemala, at least one death occurred, and flood waters damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes. Swollen rivers in Costa Rica flooded several towns and numerous banana plantations.|$|E

In November, the Jamaica Labour Party sought J$3.2billion (US$51.8million) in additional funding to repair roads damaged by Hurricanes Ivan, Dennis, Emily, and Wilma. The following month, the Jamaica Agricultural Society received J$5.5million (US$88,266) from the Japanese embassy to assist 500farmers in Portland Parish. The long-term effects of Dennis were limited, with nearly every economic sector returning to normal within a few months. The only exceptions were exports <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> and coffee crops, {{both of which were}} still recovering from Hurricane Ivan in 2004. Overall implications to the nation's gross domestic product were negligible, merely flat-lining growth rather than causing decline.

5|$|The Cold War {{split the}} {{temporary}} wartime alliance against Nazi Germany, leaving the Soviet Union and the United States as two superpowers with profound {{economic and political}} differences. The USSR was a Marxist–Leninist state led by its Communist Party of the Soviet Union, which in turn was dominated by a leader with different titles over time, and a small committee called the Politburo. The Party controlled the press, the military, the economy and many organizations. It also controlled the other states in the Eastern Bloc, and funded Communist parties around the world, sometimes in competition with Communist China, particularly following the Sino-Soviet split of the 1960s. In opposition stood the capitalist West, led by the United States, a federal republic with a two-party presidential system. The First World nations of the Western Bloc were generally democratic with a free press and independent organizations, but were economically and politically entwined with a network <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> republics and other authoritarian regimes throughout the Third World, {{most of which were}} the Western Bloc's former colonies. Some major Cold War frontlines such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Congo were still Western colonies in 1947.|$|E

5|$|The mantapa is {{the hall}} where {{groups of people}} gather during prayers. The {{entrance}} to the mantapa normally has a highly ornate overhead lintel called a makaratorana (makara is an imaginary beast and torana is an overhead decoration). The open mantapa which serves the purpose of an outer hall (outer mantapa) is a regular feature in larger Hoysala temples leading to an inner small closed mantapa and the shrine(s). The open mantapas which are often spacious have seating areas (asana) made of stone with the mantapa's parapet wall acting as a back rest. The seats may follow the same staggered square shape of the parapet wall. The ceiling here is supported by numerous pillars that create many bays. The shape of the open mantapa is best described as staggered-square and is the style used in most Hoysala temples. Even the smallest open mantapa has 13 bays. The walls have parapets that have half pillars supporting the outer ends of the roof which allow plenty of light making all the sculptural details visible. The mantapa ceiling is generally ornate with sculptures, both mythological and floral. The ceiling consists of deep and domical surfaces and contains sculptural depictions <b>of</b> <b>banana</b> bud motifs and other such decorations.|$|E
5|$|Latin American {{novels that}} explore {{political}} themes, but {{that do not}} centre upon the rule of a particular dictator, are informally classified as “not quite dictator novels”. For example, Libro de Manuel (A Manual for Manuel, 1973), by Julio Cortázar, is a postmodern novel about urban guerrillas and their revolutionary struggle, which asks the reader to examine the broader societal matters of language, sexuality, and the modes of interpretation. In the Time of the Butterflies (1994), by Julia Álvarez, {{tells the story of}} the Mirabal sisters, whom patriotism transformed from well-behaved Catholic débutantes to political dissenters against the thirty-year dictatorship of the Trujillo régime in the Dominican Republic. The novel sought to illuminate the officially-obscured-history of the deaths of the Mirabal sisters, not to determine what happened to them, but to determine how the Mirabal sisters happened to the national politics of the Dominican Republic. In the mock-diary “Intimate Diary of Solitude” (third part of El imperio de los sueños 1988; Empire of Dreams, 1994), by Giannina Braschi, the protagonist is Mariquita Samper, the diarist who shoots the narrator of the Latin American Boom in revolt against his dictatorial control of the fictional narration. Moreover, in Braschi’s most recent work “United States of Banana” (2011), the Puerto Rican prisoner Segismundo overthrows his father, the King of the United States <b>of</b> <b>Banana,</b> who had imprisoned him for more than a hundred years in the dungeon of the Statue of Liberty, for the crime of having been born. The story of Distant Star (1996), by Roberto Bolaño, begins on 11 September 1973, with the coup d’état by General Augusto Pinochet against Salvador Allende, the President of Chile. The writer and professor of literature Raymond Leslie Williams describes the aforementioned novels as not-quite-dictator-novels, which are reminiscent of the genre for being “acutely and subtly political fiction” that addresses themes different from those of the dictator novel, which cannot be divorced from the politics of the stories, and so each “can be read as a meditation on the horror of absolute power”.|$|E
