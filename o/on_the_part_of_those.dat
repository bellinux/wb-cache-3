5|$|The {{first edition}} of this work, {{published}} in 1861, was received so favourably that the author has felt bound to bestow his utmost care upon a minute and thorough revision of his book, {{in the hope of}} bringing up the information it contains to the existing state of knowledge. In this endeavour he has been assisted as well by Canon Lightfoot, to whom he is indebted for that section of the third chapter which treats of Egyptian versions of the New Testament (pp. 319-357), as also by much unsought for and most welcome help, especially <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> scholars who are named in p. 164, note. Without wishing to speak harshly of writers who are not very scrupulous in such matters, he has always thought it became him to borrow from no quarter without making a full and frank avowal of the fact. The author will be much rejoiced if this new edition shall be judged not less worthy than its predecessor to become a text book in Universities and Theological Celleges.|$|E

25|$|In the 1870s–90s, {{large-scale}} socialist, nationalist, agrarian {{and other}} political movements of great ideological fervor became established in partitioned Poland and Lithuania, along with corresponding political parties to promote them. Of the major parties, the socialist First Proletariat was founded in 1882, the Polish League (precursor of National Democracy) in 1887, the Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia and Silesia in 1890, the Polish Socialist Party in 1892, the Marxist SDKPiL in 1893, the agrarian People's Party of Galicia in 1895 and the Jewish socialist Bund in 1897. Christian democracy regional associations allied with the Catholic Church were also active; they united into the Polish Christian Democratic Party in 1919. The main minority ethnic groups of the former Commonwealth, including Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Belarusians and Jews, were getting involved in their own national movements and plans, which met with disapproval <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Polish independence activists who counted on an eventual rebirth of the Commonwealth or {{the rise of a}} Commonwealth-inspired federal structure (a political movement referred to as Prometheism).|$|E
25|$|The next 140 {{years were}} marked by an {{inability}} to take action <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> responsible {{for the maintenance of}} the drainage scheme. Once completed, it came {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Commissioners of Sewers, and routine maintenance did not take place. In 1811, the Commissioners pinned their hopes on the proposed Bristol to Taunton canal, which would have crossed the drain by an aqueduct, which would have included a new clyse at a lower level than the Dunball outlet, but the canal project came to nothing. The banks continued to slip, and the peat continued to rise up in the bottom of the drain. They asked Robert Anstice to produce a report on the condition of the drain in 1816, but it was 1818 before the report was produced and highlighted the poor state of repair of the system. They also asked for a report on ways to make the bridges wider, but nothing came of it. Ten years later, they commissioned another report, but the local landowners took matters into their own hands and asked Josiah Easton to inspect the drain.|$|E
25|$|Resolving the {{statutory}} conflict {{in this way}} allows the disparate-impact prohibition {{to work in a}} manner that is consistent with other provisions of Title VII, including the prohibition on adjusting employment-related test scores on the basis of race. See §2000e–2(l). Examinations like those administered by the City create legitimate expectations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who took the tests. As is the case with any promotion exam, some of the firefighters here invested substantial time, money, and personal commitment in preparing for the tests. Employment tests can be an important part of a neutral selection system that safeguards against the very racial animosities Title VII was intended to prevent. Here, however, the firefighters saw their efforts invalidated by the City in sole reliance upon race-based statistics. If an employer cannot rescore a test based on the candidates' race, §2000e–2(l), then it follows a fortiori that it may not take the greater step of discarding the test altogether to achieve a more desirable racial distribution of promotion-eligible candidates— absent a strong basis in evidence that the test was deficient and that discarding the results is necessary to avoid violating the disparate-impact provision. Restricting an employer's ability to discard test results (and thereby discriminate against qualified candidates on the basis of their race) also is in keeping with Title VII's express protection of bona fide promotional examinations.|$|E

500|$|American {{historian}} Lawrence Henry Gipson {{wrote of}} Abercrombie's campaign that [...] "no military campaign was ever launched on American soil that involved {{a greater number}} of errors of judgment <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> in positions of responsibility". Many military historians have cited the Battle of Carillon as a classic example of tactical military incompetence. Abercrombie, confident of a quick victory, ignored several viable military options, such as flanking the French breastworks, waiting for his artillery, or laying siege to the fort. Instead, relying on a flawed report from a young military engineer, and ignoring some of that engineer's recommendations, he decided in favor of a direct frontal assault on the thoroughly entrenched French, without the benefit of artillery. Montcalm, while concerned about the weak military position of the fort, conducted the defense with spirit. However, due in part to a lack of time, he committed strategic errors in preparing the area's defenses that a competent attacker could have exploited, and he made tactical errors that made the attacker's job easier.|$|E
500|$|In July, Clark held {{another set}} of congressional {{hearings}} on the issue, attracting widespread media coverage. The hearings were tense with Clark, Kennedy, Javits, and testifying medical observers frequently clashing with Mississippi Senators John Stennis and James Eastland (both staunch segregationists), and Mississippi Board of Health officer A. L. Gray. Kennedy called child psychologist Robert Coles to testify on poverty's effect on children in the Mississippi Delta. One North Carolina doctor described [...] "an unwritten policy <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who control the State to eliminate the Negro Mississippian either by driving {{him out of the}} State or starving him to death." [...] When Stennis and Eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state, he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves, to which none accepted. On the second day of proceedings Secretary Freeman and Senator Javits got into a shouting match, with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities' opinions, declare an emergency, and immediately supply food to the region. He remarked, [...] "We {{seem to be able to}} send airplanes to the Congo in a terrible hurry. We first heard of the desperation point of poor Mississippi Negroes 18 months agoand we are still hearing that there is starvation in Mississippi." [...] Kennedy openly expressed his frustration with Johnson administration officials' perceived inability to understand the extent of the Delta's problems and other bureaucratic complications, saying, [...] "It seems to me we are floundering around a great deal." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{equivalent}} term [...] "awakening" [...] {{has also been}} used in a Christian context, namely the Great Awakenings, several periods of religious revival in American religious history. Historians and theologians identify three or four waves of increased religious enthusiasm occurring between the early 18th century and the late 19th century. Each of these [...] "Great Awakenings" [...] was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, {{a profound sense of}} conviction and redemption <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.|$|E
2500|$|Keble claimed {{this same}} {{tendency}} was apparent in [...] "the surly or scornful impatience often exhibited...when Christian motives are suggested, and checks from Christian principles attempted {{to be enforced}} on their public conduct". Furthermore, there had been [...] "observable a growing disinclination, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> bound by VOLUNTARY OATHS, to whatever reminds them of their obligation; a growing disposition to explain it all away". People who thought of such conduct lightly were [...] "indulging or encouraging a profane dislike of God's awful Presence; a general tendency, as a people, to leave Him out of all their thoughts".|$|E
2500|$|Also, as Schippman {{observed}} (loc. Cit. Boyce, 1975:462), {{even during}} the Sassanid era (226–650 CE) {{there is no evidence}} that the fires were categorized according to their sanctity. [...] "It seems probable that there were virtually only two, namely the Atash-i Vahram [...] and the lesser Atash-i Adaran, or 'Fire of Fires', a parish fire, as it were, serving a village or town quarter" [...] (Boyce, 1975:462; Boyce 1966:63). Apparently, it was only in the Atash-i Vahram that fire was kept continuously burning, with the Adaran fires being annually relit. While the fires themselves had special names, the structures did not, and it has been suggested that [...] "the prosaic nature of the middle Persian names (kadag, man, and xanag are all words for an ordinary house) perhaps reflect a desire <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who fostered the temple-cult [...] to keep it as close as possible in character to the age-old cult of the hearth-fire, and to discourage elaboration" [...] (Boyce, 2002:9).|$|E
