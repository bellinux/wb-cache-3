40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} attitudes of {{teachers}} towards the introduction <b>of</b> the <b>multicultural</b> education within the curriculum {{reform of the}} regional system {{of education in the}} Czech Republic. The thesis then deals also with the course of implementation <b>of</b> the <b>multicultural</b> education in practice and with attitudes of teachers towards further training in this area. Since teachers are the key persons involved in the implementation of education policy, their attitude is crucial for successful implementation <b>of</b> the <b>multicultural</b> education. The methodology is based on the qualitative data analysis obtained from interviews with teachers. There are three main theoretical resources followed in this thesis, belief systems of Paul A. Sabatier, the theory of street-level bureaucracy of Michael Lipsky and multicultural education theories. Teachers have positive attitudes to the multicultural education. But some have their own prejudices against other ethnic groups. Although teachers understand positively their autonomy in the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>multicultural</b> education in practice, they express the need for certain rules in the implementation <b>of</b> the <b>multicultural</b> education. The absence of clear rules and adequate support in practice brings problems with the implementation. Based on these findings, the [...] ...|$|R

25|$|According to {{international}} relations scholar Michael Foley, paleoconservatives press for restrictions on immigration, a rollback <b>of</b> <b>multicultural</b> programmes, the decentralization {{of the federal}} policy, the restoration of controls upon free trade, a greater emphasis upon economic nationalism and non-interventionism {{in the conduct of}} American foreign policy, and a generally revanchist outlook upon a social order in need of recovering old lines of distinction and in particular the assignment of roles in accordance with traditional categories of gender, ethnicity, and race. Practitioners of this philosophy identify themselves as the legitimate heirs to the American conservative tradition.|$|E

For the two teachers, the story takes an emic perspective as Antonio, living within a Chicano culture, must find his own identity as he analyzes and questions his own connections to the culture's various ideologies, cultures, and viewpoints throughout the narrative.|$|E
