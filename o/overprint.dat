5|$|The Irish Free State (Saorstát Éireann) overprints debuted on 11 December 1922. This is a three-line <b>overprint</b> using a {{sans-serif}} typeface and {{was done}} by Thom, Harrison and the Government Printers. The last overprinted stamps were the Waterlow & Sons re-engraved King George V 2/6, 5/- and 10/- values that appeared in 1934 and were overprinted in 1937 for use in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Between 1922 and 1983 Oifig an Phoist, the Irish Post Office, {{a section}} of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (P), issued all postage stamps in the 26 {{counties}} of Ireland. During this time they employed some of the following companies to <b>overprint</b> or print the stamps: Dollard, Thom, Irish Government Printers, Waterlow and Sons (London), De La Rue and Co., Bradbury Wilkinson and Co., Ltd., (London), Harrison and Sons Ltd., (London) and Irish Security Stamp Printing Ltd.|$|E
50|$|In philately, private <b>overprints</b> or {{commercial}} <b>overprints</b> are <b>overprints</b> applied to postage stamps, postal stationery or revenue stamps by {{anyone other than}} the official stamp-issuing entity. These <b>overprints</b> have principally {{been used as a}} security measure, however, propaganda and commemorative examples are also known. When <b>overprinted</b> for security purposes, they serve a similar function to perfins. It is important to distinguish between private <b>overprints</b> and private cancellations.|$|R
50|$|<b>Overprinting</b> {{is known}} to be a common source of new genes in virus genomes. <b>Overprinting</b> can be {{detected}} bioinformatically by comparison of codon usage statistics between the original and putative <b>overprinted</b> gene; in most cases the <b>overprinted</b> gene is more phylogenetically restricted and is less likely to match the codon usage distribution found in the genome overall. <b>Overprinted</b> genes that exhibit these properties more strongly tend to be evolutionarily more recent.|$|R

5|$|Two {{distinct}} overprints were made, {{before and}} after the formal independence of the state on 6 December 1922. The Provisional Government of Ireland (Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann) overprints were initially issued on 17 February 1922, with eight low-value and three high-value stamps overprinted by Dollard and four by Thom. This <b>overprint</b> is composed of the four words Rialtas Sealadach na hÉireann and the numeral date 1922 arranged in five lines of seriffed text. The unoverprinted stamps remained valid for postage in Ireland until 31 March 1922.|$|E
25|$|In around 1904, a 3d {{postage stamp}} {{depicting}} King Edward VII was issued {{with a local}} Revenue <b>overprint.</b> From 1904 to 1912, some of the contemporary definitives depicting King Edward VII or pictorial scenes were also issued overprinted REVENUE by De La Rue, with the <b>overprint</b> being identical to that used on the 1899–1902 issue. In around 1912–13, postage stamps became valid for fiscal use, so the issue of separate revenue stamps became unnecessary. Postage stamps remained valid for fiscal use until 1926, when a law was passed limiting their use for postal purposes only.|$|E
25|$|Malta's first revenue stamps {{were issued}} on 9 August 1899, and this issue {{consisted}} of the ½d, 1d, 4d, 1/- and 5/- values from the 1885–86 postage definitive issue depicting Queen Victoria locally overprinted Revenue at the Government Printing Office in Valletta. A number of <b>overprint</b> varieties, including double and inverted overprints, are known on this issue. On 17 November 1899, four values from the same set were issued overprinted REVENUE (in capitals) by De La Rue in London, and eight further values from the contemporary definitives depicting Queen Victoria or pictorial scenes were issued with this <b>overprint</b> in 1902.|$|E
50|$|All swine duty stamps were {{stamp duty}} {{revenues}} <b>overprinted.</b> <b>Overprints</b> exist on both numeral formats, and on both decimal stamps. There {{are a number}} of variations in the font of the <b>overprints</b> used.|$|R
5000|$|In 1879, Queen Victoria {{revenues}} were <b>overprinted</b> INSURANCE in blue. These are rare and <b>overprints</b> are also known inverted. Various King Edward VII postage stamps were also <b>overprinted</b> for {{various types of}} revenue: ...|$|R

25|$|In 2005, the Central Bank of the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea issued {{commemorative}} 200, 500, 1000 and 5000 won {{notes to}} celebrate the 60th anniversary of the foundation of North Korea. It consists of an <b>overprint</b> on its regular issue notes.|$|E
25|$|To travel, each ticket {{had to be}} {{validated}} in {{a yellow}} machine on the platform. The ticket defined the type of passenger and trip as tickets do now. On validation, an <b>overprint</b> was added, giving the tramstop code, time and date of validation and the point of validation.|$|E
50|$|Stamps {{owned by}} {{commercial}} entities have sometimes privately <b>overprinted</b> {{the backs of}} their purchased stamps. These <b>overprints</b> are usually made as control marks or accounting information. Such <b>overprinting</b> does not invalidate a stamp unless it shows through the front.|$|R
50|$|Around 1945, King George V {{stamp duty}} {{issues from the}} 1920s were <b>overprinted</b> CONTRACT NOTE. These are very rare as limited stocks were {{available}} for <b>overprinting.</b> Later various King George VI postage or stamp duty stamps were similarly <b>overprinted.</b> Similar <b>overprints</b> were issued on Queen Elizabeth II revenues in 1956, and these remained in use until the 1970s. Various provisional surcharges were also issued.|$|R
5000|$|As {{with the}} {{adhesive}} stamps, the first provisional stamped envelopes were also <b>overprints</b> on U.S. stock. There were eight different U.S. envelopes that were <b>overprinted</b> [...] "CUBA." [...] and [...] "1c. (or 2c.) DE PESO.". By {{the late summer}} of 1899, the U.S. had furnished Cuba with its own Columbus design to replace the <b>overprints.</b> Likewise the first (and only) postal cards of the U.S. administration were a 1¢ U.S. Jefferson card <b>overprinted</b> with [...] "CUBA.-1c. de Peso." [...] and a 2¢ U.S. Liberty card <b>overprinted</b> with [...] "CUBA.-2c. de Peso.".|$|R
25|$|Postage stamps of Pakistan {{are those}} issued since Pakistan's {{independence}} in 1947. Pakistan Post has issued more than 600 sets and singles totalling more than 1300 stamps. Immediately after {{the independence of}} Pakistan in 1947, the new Pakistan government was preoccupied with setting up the government so British Indian stamps continued in use without an <b>overprint</b> as was the practice in other countries.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes the {{district}} office's <b>overprint</b> included a number designating the suboffice {{for which the}} stamps were intended, and occasionally suboffices applied their own handstamps. Larger offices had several different designs of handstamp in use; Mexico City used five different devices to handstamp the stamps of 1856, each with a different appearance, while {{the district}}s of Guadalajara, Guanajuato, Puebla, Querétaro, and San Luis Potosí each had three devices.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s or early 1960s {{they had a}} local printer <b>overprint</b> “INDEPENDENT RAKIURA” on eight values of some earlier New Zealand postage and health stamps. There were also eight {{different}} values from one penny to £1 overprinted on these stamps as well as having their original values blotted out with small black circles. These were sold to collectors with the proceeds helping to refurbish the Rakiura Museum.|$|E
50|$|Private <b>overprints</b> {{have been}} used to express {{political}} opinions, or to commemorate events by creating collectors' items in cases in which the <b>overprinted</b> stamps cannot be used. For instance, German sympathisers in the Sudetenland privately <b>overprinted</b> Czechoslovakian stamps with swastikas before the annexation, and in Italy, after the fall of Mussolini and his establishment of the Italian Social Republic, stamps of the King were <b>overprinted</b> with fasces by Fascist sympathizers.|$|R
5000|$|Beginning in May 1894, {{the designs}} of North Borneo were printed in {{different}} colours, with [...] "LABUAN" [...] either engraved into the vignette or <b>overprinted.</b> On 24 September 1896, the 50th anniversary of the cession was marked by <b>overprinting</b> [...] "1846 / JUBILEE / 1896" [...] on the <b>overprinted</b> North Borneo designs. Additional <b>overprints</b> appeared through the 1890s. In 1899 many types were surcharged with a value of 4 cents.|$|R
5000|$|The first Bechuanaland Protectorate {{postage stamps}} were {{produced}} in 1888 by <b>overprinting</b> stamps of Bechuanaland (some <b>overprints</b> of British stamps and some issued {{specifically for the}} colony) with [...] "Protectorate". In 1889 a ½-penny stamp of Cape of Good Hope was <b>overprinted</b> [...] "Bechuanaland / Protectorate.".|$|R
25|$|The new highest {{denomination}} 10,000 CFP franc banknote (83.8 euro) {{issued on}} 1 October 1986, {{was the first}} one that was not overprinted with a city name. The 500 franc banknote, issued in 1992, and the 1000 and 5000 franc banknotes, issued in 1995, are also without the <b>overprint.</b> The designs of the 500, 1000, 5000 franc banknotes did not change till 2014, when new designs and sizes were introduced.|$|E
25|$|Interformational sulfides; So-called serp-serp ore {{which is}} {{developed}} off a thrust pinchout, or via remobilisation of massive sulfide along a shear surface or thrust which drags ore {{up off the}} contact into the serpentinitised komatiite. Serp-serp ore may, in some cases, be similar to interspinifex ore, the diagnostic spinifex textures often absent due to thermal erosion or metamorphic <b>overprint,</b> and can only be determined as such by comparison of chemistry of the ultramafics above and below.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of {{independence}} in August 1947, the country inherited a divided (east and west) postal system established by the British rulers. The new system started operating under the modified Post Office Act no VI of 1898. The post office {{was part of the}} joint Department of Posts and Telegraph of the Ministry of Communications. Though the Office of the Postmaster General became operational at Lahore from 15 August 1947, the newly formed government was too preoccupied with establishing itself, therefore British Indian stamps continued to be used without an <b>overprint</b> as was the practice in other countries.|$|E
25|$|On 1 October 1947, the {{government}} released its first stamps, being from the 1940s British India series of King George VI stamps <b>overprinted</b> {{with the word}} Pakistan.

50|$|British stamps <b>overprinted</b> M.E.F. (Middle East Forces) {{were used}} from 1943 to 1948 after {{the area was}} {{captured}} by the British during World War II. From 1 July 1948 stamps <b>overprinted</b> B.M.A. TRIPOLATANIA were used. From 6 February 1950 to December 1951 the stamps were <b>overprinted</b> B.A. TRIPOLITANIA.|$|R

25|$|In early May 1948, the Jewish {{provisional}} government, {{known as}} Minhelet Ha'am, {{did not have}} its own postage stamps ready, so it used existing labels, both JNF labels, which otherwise have been printed since 1902 for fundraising purposes, and local community tax stamps. The JNF labels were given a Hebrew <b>overprint</b> meaning postage (doar), (as shown in the picture), whereas local community tax stamps were not given overprints. The JNF stamps were printed from May 3 to 14, 1948, their sale ended on May 14, 1948, with remaining stocks ordered to be returned and destroyed. Use of these stamps was tolerated until May 22, 1948. The Mandate's postal rates remained unchanged during this period.|$|E
500|$|Collecting and {{identifying}} the overprints {{can be an}} arduous task as there are numerous variations in the <b>overprint</b> settings. Feldman states [...] "the complex details of plating, shading, <b>overprint</b> colours, accurate measurements, to mention a few, often discourage even the most enthusiastic collector". Three specialised books, or catalogue chapters, (Freeman & Stubbs, Munk and Meredith), issued within five years of issue have concentrated on this topic and Meredith is regarded as unequalled.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Hawaii <b>overprint</b> note was ordered from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing on 8 June 1942 (all were made-over 1934-1935 bills). Issued in denominations of $1, $5, $10, and $20, only the $1 was a silver certificate, the others were Federal Reserve Notes. Stamped “HAWAII” (in small solid letters on the obverse and large letters on the reverse), with the Treasury seal and serial numbers in brown {{instead of the usual}} blue, these notes could be demonetized {{in the event of a}} Japanese invasion. [...] Additional World War II emergency currency was issued in November 1942 for circulation in Europe and Northern Africa. Printed with a bright yellow seal, these notes ($1, $5, and $10) could be demonetized should the United States lose its position in the European or North African campaigns.|$|E
