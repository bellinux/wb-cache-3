40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{critically}} examine and reformulate T. H. Marshall's concept <b>of</b> industrial <b>citizenship,</b> and apply the reformulated model to a case study of the UK. Design/methodology/approach: Marshall's conceptualisation <b>of</b> industrial <b>citizenship</b> is criticised for neglecting the rights of unions as collective rights and for treating industrial citizenship as an aggregation of individual rights. Subsequent attempts to use the idea <b>of</b> industrial <b>citizenship</b> are similarly flawed. A case study of changes to industrial citizenship in the UK in the 1980 s and 1990 s is used to develop the new model and provide evidence in support of it. Findings: An alternative conceptualisation <b>of</b> industrial <b>citizenship</b> is presented that outlines collective and individual powers, obligations, liberties, constraints, immunities and liabilities. This model is illustrated using examples from the Conservative governments' industrial relations legislation of the 1980 s and 1990 s. Originality/value: Discussions and applications of T. H. Marshall's concept <b>of</b> industrial <b>citizenship</b> are few and far between. The paper proposes an original re-conceptualisation specifying the collective rights of unions in the British regime <b>of</b> industrial <b>citizenship.</b> This new concept <b>of</b> industrial <b>citizenship</b> is then applied to the radical changes in industrial relations legislation in the UK in the 1980 s and 1990 s...|$|R
