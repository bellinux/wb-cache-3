5|$|Frankenstein, MD is {{presented}} as an educational webseries presented by medical students (and later doctors) Victoria Frankenstein and Iggy DeLacey from the fictional Engle State University. Each episode generally consists of Frankenstein experimenting with cutting-edge medical technologies or theories, often using DeLacey or her childhood friends Eli Lavenza and Rory Clerval as subjects. Dr. Abraham Waldman serves {{as an adviser to}} Frankenstein, usually acting as a foil and reminding her of the impracticality <b>or</b> <b>perceived</b> impossibility of her experiments and theories.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, President Obama {{signed into}} law the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which {{contained}} in it the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, the first addition to existing federal hate crime law in the United States since Democratic President Bill Clinton {{signed into law}} the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996. The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act expanded existing federal hate crime laws in the United States to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual <b>or</b> <b>perceived</b> gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.|$|E
5|$|Nationalist {{movements}} {{in some countries}} and regions, notably Guatemala, Indonesia and Indochina were often allied with communist groups, <b>or</b> <b>perceived</b> in the West to be allied with communists. In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s; additionally, the Soviets saw continuing losses by imperial powers as presaging the eventual victory of their ideology. Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence.|$|E
5|$|The tremolo call—sometimes {{called the}} “laughing” call—is {{characterized}} by its short, wavering quality. It often uses this call to signal distress or alarm caused by territorial disputes <b>or</b> <b>perceived</b> threats. It emits a tremulous series {{of up to}} 10 rather high notes (hu)-heheheheheheha. It also uses the tremolo to communicate its presence to other loons when they arrive at a lake, often when they are flying overhead. It is the only vocalization used in flight. The tremolo call has varying three levels of intensities that correlate with a loon’s level of distress, and the types are differentiated by increasingly higher pitch frequencies added to the call.|$|E

5000|$|Uh-oh ( [...] , [...] ) is a {{ubiquitous}} interjection or {{expression of}} dismay in the English language, usually said {{in anticipation of}} something bad about to happen, with the sly admittance of guilt that one may have caused something bad to happen, <b>or</b> <b>perceiving</b> that something bad has already happened. The speaker often gives vent to the expression immediately upon learning <b>or</b> <b>perceiving</b> of something that presages disaster. It is an expression usually acquired very early in life, typically {{as early as the}} toddler stage. It is one of only a few words or phrases in American English commonly pronounced with a glottal stop.|$|R

5|$|Australia's {{working class}} culture also {{influenced}} {{that of the}} AIF. Approximately three-quarters of AIF volunteers {{were members of the}} working class, with a high proportion also being trade unionists, and soldiers frequently applied their attitudes to industrial relations to the Army. Throughout the war there were incidents where soldiers refused to undertake tasks that they considered demeaning or protested against actual <b>or</b> <b>perceived</b> mistreatment by their officers. These actions were similar to the strikes many soldiers had taken part in during their pre-enlistment employment, with the men not seeing themselves as mutineers. The protests which occurred in 1918 over the planned disbandment of several battalions also used similar tactics to those employed in industrial disputes. Historian Nathan Wise has judged that the frequent use of industrial action in the AIF led to improved conditions for the soldiers, and contributed to it having a less strict military culture than was common in the British Army.|$|E
5|$|Lured by {{numerous}} incentives {{such as food}} coupons, better housing and other benefits, they were received coldly by the Armenians living in the Republic upon their arrival. The repatriates spoke the Western Armenian dialect, instead of the Eastern Armenian spoken in Soviet Armenia. They were often addressed as aghbars ("brothers") by Armenians living in the republic, due to their different pronunciation of the word. Although initially used in humor, the word went on {{to carry on a}} more pejorative connotation. Their treatment by the Soviet government was not much better. A number of Armenian immigrants in 1946 had their belongings confiscated upon arrival at Odessa's port, as they had taken with them everything they had, including clothes and jewelry. This was the first disappointment experienced by Armenians; however, as there was no possibility of return the Armenians were forced to continue their journey to Armenia. Many of the immigrants were targeted by Soviet intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Interior for real <b>or</b> <b>perceived</b> ties to Armenian nationalist organizations, and were later sent to labor camps in Siberia and elsewhere, where they would not be released until after Stalin's death.|$|E
5|$|Following the Battle of Dogger Bank, the Admiralty saw {{the need}} for {{dedicated}} battlecruiser squadrons in British waters, and earmarked Australia to lead one of them. On 11 January, while en route to Jamaica, Australia was diverted to Gibraltar. Reaching there on 20 January, the battlecruiser was ordered to proceed to Plymouth, where she arrived on 28 January and paid off for a short refit. The docking was completed on 12 February, and Australia reached Rosyth on 17 February after sailing through a gale. She was made flagship of the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (2nd BCS) of the Battlecruiser Fleet, part of the British Grand Fleet, on 22 February. Vice Admiral Patey was appointed to command this squadron. In early March, to avoid a conflict of seniority between Patey {{and the leader of}} the Battlecruiser Fleet, Vice Admiral David Beatty, Patey was reassigned to the West Indies, and Rear Admiral William Pakenham raised his flag aboard Australia. British and Allied ships deployed to the North Sea were tasked with protecting the British Isles from German naval attack, and keeping the German High Seas Fleet penned in European waters through a distant blockade while trying to lure them into a decisive battle. During her time with the 2nd BCS, Australias operations primarily consisted of training exercises (either in isolation or with other ships), patrols of the North Sea area in response to actual <b>or</b> <b>perceived</b> German movements, and some escort work. These duties were so monotonous, one sailor was driven insane.|$|E

50|$|Humans {{experience}} stress, <b>or</b> <b>perceive</b> {{things as}} threatening, {{when they do}} not believe that their resources for coping with obstacles (stimuli, people, situations, etc.) are enough for what the circumstances demand.
