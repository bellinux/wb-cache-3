5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} grows anxious as the premiere of the PBS TV {{documentary}} The Office: An American Workplace draws near. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) combines an unflattering appraisal of himself from an early newspaper <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> his blunt self-assessment that he is unlikely to remain employed at Dunder Mifflin for very long after it airs, and decides {{it is time to}} pursue his dreams of stardom. After many fruitless calls to dismissive talent agencies, he finds himself at the dual talent agency/real estate office run by Carla Fern (Roseanne Barr). Carla agrees to represent Andy, who is thrilled that he only has to pay $5,000 for the privilege.|$|E
5|$|When Ronald Reagan's {{administration}} {{took power}} in 1981, the export restrictions {{put in place}} by the Carter administration were slowly relaxed. At first, the FX program continued as normal, but a number of events eroded the value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> limit the F-5G's potential sales. The signing of the 1982 US-PRC Joint Communiqué was a major agreement on arms sales, which continued blocking sales of the F-5G to Taiwan. By this point the Taiwanese had started their own light-fighter project, the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo. In signing the Communiqué, the U.S. was signaling that Taiwan would not receive modern aircraft, therefore the Ching-kuo became Taiwan's primary focus. As a result, the F-5G's sales potential remained unestablished.|$|E

25|$|Arguably, {{concurrent}} {{logic programming}} {{is based on}} message passing and consequently {{is subject to the}} same indeterminacy as other concurrent message-passing systems, such as Actors (see Indeterminacy in concurrent computation). Carl Hewitt has argued that, concurrent logic programming is not based on logic in his sense that computational steps cannot be logically deduced. However, in concurrent logic programming, any result of a terminating computation is a logical consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> <b>and</b> any partial result of a partial computation is a logical consequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> the residual goal (process network). Consequently, the indeterminacy of computations implies that not all logical consequences of the program can be deduced.|$|E
