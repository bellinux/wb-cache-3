To the authorities, counterintelligence was a fundamental line of defence.

5|$|The first {{recordings}} {{were made}} during the European leg of Garbage's Version 2.0 world tour. After listening to the orchestral demo, the band worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> and tempo. Garbage used a portable studio {{from a number of}} European cities to record material for Arnold, keeping in touch by phone as he produced the song's string arrangement in London. Since the strings carried the structure of the song, they had to be finalised and recorded before Manson could sing her parts. Arnold recorded the strings with a 60-piece orchestra in one day at London's Metropolis Studios.|$|E

5|$|During the Cold War {{the future}} park area {{was used as}} a {{training}} ground for Cuban exiles training for missions in Fidel Castro's Cuba. Elliott Key in particular was used by the Central Intelligence Agency as a training area in the early 1960s in preparation for Bay of Pigs invasion. The largest facility was Ledbury Lodge, the only hotel ever built <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>key.</b> As late as 1988 a group of Cuban exiles were arrested when they tried to use the key for a mock landing. Farther north, exiled Venezuelan president Marcos Pérez Jiménez kept a house on Soldier Key until he was extradited in 1963.|$|E
5|$|In FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, {{defending}} team {{players are}} allowed to stay <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> for an unlimited amount of time. In American professional basketball, defending team players are also prohibited from staying in the key {{for more than three}} seconds, unless a player is directly guarding an offensive player. If a player surpasses that time, the defending team will be charged with a defensive three-second violation, which will result in a technical foul where the team with the ball shoots one free throw plus ball possession and a reset of the shot clock. In all cases, the count resets if the shot hits the rim or if the player steps out of the lane.|$|E

The Finisterre Range {{campaign}} began on 17 September when the 2/6th Independent Company was air-landed in the Markham Valley. The company defeated a larger Japanese force at Kaiapit and secured an airstrip which was used to fly the Division's 21st and 25th Brigades in. Through aggressive patrolling the Australians forced the Japanese out of positions in extremely rugged terrain and in January 1944 the division began its attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> Shaggy Ridge position.

Following this success the Japanese withdrew from the Finisterre Range and Australian troops linked up with American patrols from Saidor on 21 April and secured Madang on 24 April.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. IBM PC {{keyboard}} has 104 keys, {{while the}} PC keyboards for most {{other countries have}} 105 keys. In an operating system configured for a non-English language, the keys are placed differently. For example, keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to release space for Ñ/ñ; similarly those for French or Portuguese may have a special key for the character Ç/ç. Keyboards designed for Japanese may have special keys to switch between Japanese and Latin scripts, and the character ¥ (Japanese yen or Chinese yuan currency symbol) instead of \ (backslash, which may {{be replaced by the}} former in some typefaces and codepages). Using a keyboard for alternative languages leads to a conflict: the image <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>key</b> does not correspond to the character. In such cases, each new language may require an additional label <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>key,</b> because the standard keyboard layouts do not even share similar characters of different languages.|$|E

40|$|Extensive {{parametric}} {{data were}} obtained from pigeons responding on variable-interval schedules arranged on three, two, and one response keys. Number of responses <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>keys,</b> <b>the</b> time spent responding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>keys,</b> and <b>the</b> number of reinforcements obtained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>keys</b> were measured. Response rates on each key were an increasing function of <b>the</b> reinforcement rate <b>on</b> that key, and an inverse function of <b>the</b> reinforcement rate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other <b>keys.</b> In terms of preference, both response and time-allocation ratios undermatched ratios of obtained reinforcements, {{and the degree of}} undermatching was consistent both within, and between, two- and three-schedule data. When absolute response-rate data were analyzed according to Herrnstein's (1970) quantitative account, obtained values of assumed constants were not consistent either within or between conditions. However, a power-function modification of Herrnstein's account fitted the data well and provided similar exponent values to those obtained for the undermatching of preference ratios...|$|R
