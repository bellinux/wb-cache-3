5|$|After {{reaching}} Australian waters, Sydney {{spent most}} of her time on fleet exercises and training cruises. In 1938, the cruiser was one of several RAN units prepared to respond to the Munich crisis, but all ships stood down after the potential war was averted. From 17 to 19 April 1939, Sydney was one of eight warships involved in a joint forces trade protection exercise off the south-east Australian coast. In early August 1939, Sydney was in Darwin, prior to visiting the Netherlands East Indies. However, in response to the events which prompted the start of World War II, Sydney was ordered to sail to Fremantle <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing,</b> where she arrived on 22 August.|$|E
5|$|The {{occupation}} of Czechoslovakia by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany in March 1939 convinced Huggins that war was imminent. Seeking to renew his government's mandate to pass emergency measures, he called an early election {{in which his}} United Party won an increased majority. Huggins rearranged his Cabinet <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing,</b> making the Minister of Justice Robert Tredgold Minister of Defence as well. The territory proposed forces not only for internal security {{but also for the}} defence of British interests overseas. Self-contained Rhodesian formations were planned, including a mechanised reconnaissance unit, but Tredgold opposed this. Remembering the catastrophic casualties suffered by units such as the Newfoundland Regiment and the South African Brigade on the Western Front in World War I, he argued that one or two heavy defeats for a white Southern Rhodesian brigade might cause crippling losses and have irrevocable effects on the country as a whole. He proposed to instead concentrate on training white Rhodesians for leadership roles and specialist units, and to disperse the colony's men across the forces in small groups. These ideas met with approval in both Salisbury and London and were adopted.|$|E

25|$|After Catherine's {{death in}} 1796 the new ruler, Tsar Paul I ordered that his father, Peter III, be reburied {{in a grand}} ceremony. Alexei Orlov was ordered to carry the Imperial Crown {{in front of the}} coffin. Orlov was briefly {{suspected}} of having been one of the assassins of Paul I. Orlov left Russia during the reign of Paul I, but returned to Moscow after his death and the accession of Tsar Alexander I. Orlov commanded the militia of the fifth district during the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806-7, which was placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing</b> almost entirely at his own expense.|$|E
25|$|On 9 April 1940, Storm was {{guarding}} the approaches to Bergen, a restricted naval port, and was under orders to fire at any intruder. Reports of foreign warships moving against Norway had motivated the naval commander in Bergen, Rear-Admiral Carsten Tank-Nielsen {{to put his}} forces <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing.</b> Lieutenant Pettersen had suggested to Admiral Tank-Nielsen placing his vessel at the outer line of the restricted area, with further forces closer to Bergen. Before reaching the area covered by Storm, any intruders would have to pass a line of small patrol boats {{with the task of}} identifying incoming ships and reporting back to Tank-Nielsen. By 22:00 on 8 April, Storm was in position to defend the Bergen approaches.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shock of}} peace, though not so abrupt {{as that of}} war almost four years previously, took some getting used to. Ticonderoga and her sister ships {{remained}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> full <b>war</b> <b>footing.</b> She continued patrols over Japanese territory and sent reconnaissance flights in search of camps containing Allied prisoners of war so that air-dropped supplies could be rushed to them. On 6 September - {{four days after the}} formal surrender ceremony aboard [...] - Ticonderoga entered Tokyo Bay.|$|R
50|$|In 1662, Ming loyalist Koxinga and his {{followers}} laid siege to the Dutch outpost, and eventually established the Kingdom of Tungning. Under {{the terms of the}} surrender, Koxinga took over all the Dutch leases. <b>On</b> <b>a</b> constant <b>war</b> <b>footing,</b> and denied maritime trade by the hostile Dutch-Qing alliance, the Kingdom of Tungning intensively exploited these lands to feed their vast army. This resulted in a number of brutally suppressed rebellions by the indigenous population and a gradual weakening of Middag.|$|R
5000|$|In 1936, an Information and Propaganda Committee {{was created}} within the Home Ministry, which issued all {{official}} press statements, and which worked {{together with the}} Publications Monitoring Department on censorship issues. In 1937, jointly with the Ministry of Education, the Home Ministry administered the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement, and the Home Ministry assisted in implementation of the National Mobilization Law in 1938 to place Japan <b>on</b> <b>a</b> total <b>war</b> <b>footing.</b> The public health functions of the Ministry were separated into the Ministry of Health in 1938.|$|R
25|$|Roosevelt came {{to place}} great value on Donovan's insight. Following Germany's and the USSR's invasions of Poland in September 1939 {{and the start}} of World War II in Europe, President Roosevelt began to put the United States <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing.</b> This was a crisis of the sort that Donovan had predicted, and he sought out a {{responsible}} place in the wartime infrastructure. On the recommendation of Donovan's friend, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox, Roosevelt gave him a number of increasingly important assignments. In 1940 and 1941, Donovan traveled as an informal emissary to Britain, where he was urged by Knox and Roosevelt to gauge Britain's ability to withstand Germany's aggression.|$|E
25|$|At {{first the}} pro-Iraqi Ba'ath branch and the pro-Syrian Ba'ath branch worked {{side-by-side}} in the National Front, but with tension increasing between the Syrian and Iraqi Ba'athist factions {{the two parties}} were <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing.</b> The party was active in 1960s demonstrations, and al-Rafei was detained by Lebanese authorities for his political activities; however, he was a candidate from Tripoli in the 1968 general election. The party expanded {{during the first half}} of the 1970s, and in the 1972 general election al-Rafi was elected to parliament from Tripoli; Ali al-Khalil, a former member, was elected from Tyre. The party was active in Southern Lebanon, and was built with generous aid from Iraq. During the Lebanese Civil War, the Lebanese parliament formed the National Dialogue Committee in 1975; Assem Qanso of the pro-Syrian Ba'ath Party became a member, but no figures from the pro-Iraqi Ba'ath Party were given a seat on the committee. Tahsein al-Atrash, leader of the Ba'ath branch at the time, was shot dead in November 1981. The party was a member of the Lebanese National Movement, a political organisation led by Walid Jumblatt of the Progressive Socialist Party; throughout its existence, it has controlled the Palestinian Arab Liberation Front.|$|E
25|$|Seven {{years after}} the {{conclusion}} of the Crimean War, the Russian corvette, and flagship of the Russian Pacific squadron, Bogatyr visited Melbourne and Sydney in 1863. The corvette visited the cities on a navigational drill under the Commander of the Russian Pacific Fleet Rear Admiral Andrey Alexandrovich Popov, and the ship and crew were welcomed with warmth. Popov paid Governor of Victoria Henry Barkly and Governor of New South Wales John Young protocol visits, and they in turn visited the Russian ship. The Russians opened the ship for public visitation in Melbourne, and more than 8,000 Australians visited the ship {{over a period of several}} days. The goodwill visit was a success, but the Bogatyr's appearance in Melbourne did put the city <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing,</b> as noted in The Argus which reported that the ship managed to approach Melbourne unnoticed, ostensibly due to the lack of naval forces in Port Phillip Bay. After the Bogatyr had left the Colony, the Sydney Morning Herald reported on 7 April 1863 that the crew of the ship had engaged in topographical surveys of the Port Jackson and Botany Bay areas, which included investigating coastal fortifications, but this did not raise any eyebrows at the time.|$|E
50|$|The Survey {{concluded}} {{that one reason}} German production rose in so many areas was in part that the German economy did not go <b>on</b> <b>a</b> complete <b>war</b> <b>footing</b> until late 1942 and 1943. Up until then, factories had been <b>on</b> <b>a</b> single shift in many industries and the German economy was generally inefficient and not operating at full capacity. They also noted that women's participation in the manufacturing field remained low, lower than during World War I. The sections of the Survey regarding the German production system remain {{one of the best}} resources on the topic.|$|R
5000|$|On 19 July 1944, Adolf Hitler {{issued an}} order from his headquarters, Wolfsschanze, 150 km west of Stalag Luft VI, [...] "concerning {{preparations}} {{for the defense of}} the Reich". It put the German civilian population <b>on</b> <b>a</b> total <b>war</b> <b>footing</b> and issued instructions for preparations for evacuations of 'foreign labor' (slave labor) and civilians away from the advancing Soviet Army in the east. Item 6(a) called for [...] "preparations for moving prisoners of war to the rear". This prolonged the war {{for hundreds of thousands of}} Allied personnel, as well as causing them severe hardship, starvation, injuries and/or death.|$|R
5000|$|Innis {{believed}} that the overwhelming spatial bias of modern media was heightened in the United States {{by the development of}} powerful military technologies, including atomic weapons. The advent of the Cold War led to such <b>an</b> emphasis <b>on</b> military preparedness that the U.S. was placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> permanent <b>war</b> <b>footing,</b> its economy increasingly dependent on the manufacture of weapons. As Canadian scholar Arthur Kroker writes, [...] "Innis's political lesson was clear: the United States was now a fully 'space-oriented' society, with no inner coordinating principle and with no organic conception of 'lived tradition,' time, succession or duration which might act as an inner check against the politics of imperialism." ...|$|R
500|$|For {{political}} reasons, Sadat dismissed Sadek's arguments. The government's {{political position}} was perilous as the Egyptian public, {{angered by the}} [...] "No War, No Peace" [...] situation with Israel, demanded action. The economy, already suffering {{from the loss of}} the Suez Canal revenues and the Sinai oil fields, could not cope with the country being <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing</b> for an extended period. War was a desperate option, and a limited offensive under the current circumstances was the only solution.|$|E
500|$|Governor Vaudreuil {{was warned}} again in August that expeditions against Quebec and Montreal were being organised. [...] He called out his militia, rallied local Indians, and {{prepared}} his defences {{as best he}} could, putting the whole colony <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing.</b> [...] In mid-October word reached Quebec that large ships were approaching, heightening tensions further. [...] It turned out they were French, and on board was a scout Vaudreuil had sent downriver on 19 September to watch for the British fleet. [...] The scout reported finding the wreckage of seven ships and an estimated 1,500 bodies. [...] Although locals were already plundering through the wreckage, the colony organised a formal salvage operation that recovered items like anchors, chains, tents, and cannons; the items recovered were auctioned.|$|E
500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Munich, Chamberlain continued to pursue a course of cautious rearmament. He told the Cabinet in early October 1938, [...] "t would be madness {{for the country to}} stop rearming until we were convinced that other countries would act in the same way. For the time being, therefore, we should relax no particle of effort until our deficiencies had been made good." [...] However, later in October, he resisted calls to put industry <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing,</b> convinced that such an action would show Hitler that the Prime Minister had decided to abandon Munich. Chamberlain hoped that the understanding he had signed with Hitler at Munich would lead toward a general settlement of European disputes. However, Hitler expressed no public interest in following up on the accord. Having considered a general election immediately following Munich Chamberlain instead reshuffled his Cabinet. By the end of the year, however, public concerns caused Chamberlain to conclude that [...] "to get rid of this uneasy and disgruntled House of Commons by a General Election" [...] would be [...] "suicidal".|$|E
50|$|Resistance economy (اقتصاد مقاومتی) {{is a way}} to {{circumvent}} sanctions against a country or region experiencing sanctions. This can involve increasing resilience by substituting local inputs for imported inputs, the smuggling of goods and an increase in barter trade. A country may even attempt to turn these pressures into opportunities. In some ways sanctioned economies bear some resemblance to <b>an</b> economy <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> or emergency <b>footing.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{failure of}} the Luftwaffe during Barbarossa was {{reflected}} in its losses, with 2,093 aircraft of all types being destroyed. Soviet losses stand at 21,200 destroyed, 10,000 in combat, of which 7,500 were shot down by the Luftwaffe fighters, who could now boast {{some of the top}} aces like Günther Lützow who had already surpassed the 100 victory mark; these scores were to increase over time. The successes of the German air arm were offset by the losses which unlike the Soviet Air Force could not be replaced easily as the German economy had not yet been put <b>on</b> <b>a</b> full <b>war</b> <b>footing.</b> Losses in personnel were also high and irreplaceable with 3,231 killed, 2,028 missing and 8,453 wounded.|$|R
40|$|The Americas and Latin America in {{particular}} are sharply {{in advance of the}} global norm {{when it comes to the}} incidence of female presidential and prime ministerial leadership. One reason is the relatively high and increasing incidence of democracy on the two continents. Another is that the Americas are more progressive than other parts of the world. The relatively peaceful state of the region over the last half century is an additional factor, for women favor peace and force works to their disadvantage. The theory that dynastic advantages account for the prominence of female leadership in the Americas is erroneous. United States has lacked female leadership because of a countervailing male culture that blocks women’s aspirations, and because the nation has been <b>on</b> <b>a</b> near-permanent <b>war</b> <b>footing.</b> In <b>an</b> appendix, the arguments are supported by a table listing the world’s “Women Prime Ministers and Presidents 1960 - 2010. ...|$|R
500|$|Lord Maugham {{resigned}} on 3 September 1939, {{giving his}} failing health {{as a reason}} (he was 73 {{when he left the}} post), and he was replaced by Lord Caldecote a day later. Caldecote only held the office for eight months, but during this period spent a large amount of time preparing legislation for the Second World War. Putting the country <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing</b> would impact on the ability of people to fulfil their civil obligations if, for example, they were conscripted, and Schuster was made chairman of a Cabinet subcommittee [...] "to consider the problems arising from the inability of persons, owing to war conditions, to fulfil their contractual and other obligations, and in particular to consider the complaints already made to MPs and government departments". The subcommittee made six reports and their recommendations were eventually made into the Liabilities (Wartime Adjustment) Acts of 1941 and 1944. Schuster also led the committee that drafted the USA (Visiting Forces) Bill that provided that any criminal proceedings in relation to the behaviour of US soldiers stationed in Britain would be led by the US military authorities rather than the British government.|$|E
500|$|The {{battalion}} {{was placed}} <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing</b> on 6 December as {{tensions in the}} region escalated. Two days later, the Japanese invasion of Malaya commenced; while the fighting raged elsewhere, the 2/18th remained unengaged around Mersing. On 26 December, {{a small group of}} 2/18th men were detached to an ad hoc British raiding force known as [...] "Roseforce" [...] {{to take part in a}} raid behind Japanese lines, ambushing a Japanese convoy. It was not until 3 January however that the battalion came into contact with the Japanese for the first time, with a patrol from the 2/18th capturing two Japanese airmen who had been shot down near the mouth of the Sekakap River. A fortnight later, Japanese advances along the peninsula to the west led to concerns about the coastal defences being outflanked and cut off. As result, on 17 January, the 2/18th was ordered to withdraw south [...] to Jemaluang without having met the Japanese in battle. Following a landing around Mersing, the Japanese began to advance south towards Jemaluang in large numbers. In response, on 26 January the 2/18th Battalion, supported by two batteries of artillery from the 2/10th Field Regiment, was tasked with establishing an ambush near the Nithsdale Estate and the rubber plantation at Joo Lye.|$|E

In the war with Napoleon during 1806-07, Orlov commanded the militia of the fifth district, which was placed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing</b> almost entirely at his own expense. He left an estate worth five million roubles and 30,000 serfs.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the victory}} at Edington and {{resultant}} peace treaty, Alfred set about transforming his Kingdom of Wessex into <b>a</b> society <b>on</b> <b>a</b> full-time <b>war</b> <b>footing.</b> He built <b>a</b> navy, reorganised the army, {{and set up}} a system of fortified towns known as burhs. He mainly used old Roman cities for his burhs, as he was able to rebuild and reinforce their existing fortifications. To maintain the burhs, and the standing army, he set up a taxation system known as the Burghal Hidage. These burhs (or burghs) operated as defensive structures. The Vikings were thereafter unable to cross large sections of Wessex: the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle reports that a Danish raiding party was defeated when it tried to attack the burh of Chichester. The burhs, although primarily designed as defensive structures, were also commercial centres, attracting traders and markets to a safe haven, and they provided a safe place for the king's moneyers and mints. [...] A new wave of Danish invasions commenced in the year 891, beginning <b>a</b> <b>war</b> that lasted over three years. Alfred's new system of defence worked, however, and ultimately it wore the Danes down: they gave up and dispersed in the summer of 896.|$|R
50|$|Aoki {{was born}} to a farming family in Sarashina District, Nagano {{prefecture}} (now {{part of the city}} of Nagano), and was trained as a lawyer, graduating from the Law School of Tokyo Imperial University in 1916. On graduation, he entered the Ministry of Finance. Rising rapidly through the ranks, Aoki became chief of the Financial Bureau under Takahashi Korekiyo, who made use of his legal background to have Aoki draft a Foreign Exchange Management Act, which was passed by the Diet of Japan in 1933. Up until that time, Japan had not attempted to implement comprehensive state control over foreign exchange. Aoki followed up on this law with the Rice Control Act (1933) and the Petroleum Control Act (1934), which set the stage for increasing state control over strategic sectors of the economy. He was also on the committee which drafted the National Service Draft Ordinance, which placed the Japanese economy <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> economy <b>footing</b> after the start of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe asked Aoki to become deputy director of the Cabinet Planning Board in 1937, and he became its chairman in 1939. The same year, Aoki was nominated to a seat in the Upper House in the Diet.|$|R

Baldwin made a rare speech in the House of Lords on 4 October where he said he could not have gone to Munich but praised Chamberlain's courage and said the responsibility of a Prime Minister was not to commit the country to war until he was sure that it was ready to fight. If there was a 95% chance of war in the future, he would still choose peace. He also said he would put industry <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing</b> tomorrow as the opposition to such a move had disappeared. Churchill said in a speech: [...] "He says he would mobilise tomorrow.

2500|$|During {{the early}} 1930s, Wietersheim {{served as the}} Chief of Staff of the 3rd Division and {{continued}} his work with the Defense Ministry. He was promoted to Oberst (colonel) in November 1932 and to Generalmajor (major general) in July 1934. When the Defense Ministry was reorganized as the War Ministry (Reichskriegministerium) under Adolf Hitler, chancellor of Germany and dictator since 1933, in 1935 to match Hitler's simultaneous dissolution of the Reichswehr and creation of the greatly expanded, war-oriented Wehrmacht, Wietersheim was made the Oberquartiermeister I (O.

[...] As the General Staff was put <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>footing,</b> this high-level logistics command was a [...] "key position," [...] and von Wietersheim, [...] "a brilliant Generalmajor," [...] held this role from March 1935 until later-Field Marshal Erich von Manstein, at that time junior to von Wietersheim, took over for him in October 1936. During this time Wietersheim had been promoted to Generalleutnant, and, after handing over his post as O. Qu.

25|$|The citizen Draka army {{is made up}} {{of shock}} troops, meant to be used as the arm of {{decision}} in maneuver warfare. These Citizen troops are, to a man (and woman), superb physical specimens, unbelievably strong with startling muscle definition, astonishing stamina and reactions, and are the equal of several elite enemy soldiers, due to their fanatical and relentless dedication to fitness, physical conditioning, endless combat training and diet. Draka men and women are trained for combat from their infancy. Free Draka troops can be disciplined by superior officers for neglecting to keep their physiques and fitness sharply honed to the highest possible standard, although this would be extremely rare, as poor physical conditioning would be seen as an affront to one's family and reputation. Their physical regimen is expected to be maintained in times of relative peace, as the Draka are almost always <b>on</b> <b>a</b> permanent <b>war</b> <b>footing.</b> For attritional warfare, the Domination uses Janissary slave soldiers, who make up 60% of the Draka army. These troops are also quite formidable, and are probably <b>on</b> <b>a</b> par with regular Alliance combatants, although they are less well armed or equipped than their Draka masters or enemy troops. Draka soldiers neither ask nor give quarter—all captured enemies are killed, permanently enslaved or on very rare occasions used as hostages to trade for serfs and Janissaries captured by the enemy or Citizen troops who for some reason have been unable to take their own lives to avoid capture, perhaps through injury because Draka are never willingly captured alive. Several of the books' characters, however, do pay professional, if not personal, respect {{from time to time to}} the bravery, skill and tenacity of enemy troops they encounter, and if the enemy's equipment doesn't always impress, the Draka occasionally acknowledge their good use of it.|$|R
