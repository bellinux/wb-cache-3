5|$|Built between 946 and 972, el-Mansuriya was a walled city holding {{elaborate}} palaces {{surrounded by}} gardens, artificial pools and water channels. It was briefly the centre <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> state that encompassed most of North Africa and Sicily. It continued {{to serve as}} provincial capital of the Zirids until 1057, when it was destroyed by the invading Banu Hilal tribes. Any useful objects or relics were scavenged during the centuries that followed. Today, only faint traces remain.|$|E

5|$|During the 1950s {{when the}} Belgians began {{to fear that}} the rise <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> Luba elite would become a threat to colonial rule, the {{administration}} began to support Lulua organisations. This further contributed to the growing ethnic polarisation between the two groups. In 1952, an organisation called the Lulua Frères (Lulua Brothers) was established to campaign for socio-economic advancement of the Lulua group and became an unofficial representative of the Bena Lulua.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, the Japanese Combined Fleet {{withdrew from}} its base at Truk and was divided between Palau and Singapore. The {{appearance}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> Japanese squadron at Singapore concerned the Allies, {{as it was}} feared that this force could potentially conduct raids in the Indian Ocean and against Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|In {{dealing with}} Stalin, Truman {{decided to give}} the Soviet leader vague hints about the {{existence}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> new weapon without going into details. However, the other Allies were unaware that Soviet intelligence had penetrated the Manhattan Project in its early stages, so Stalin already knew {{of the existence of}} the atomic bomb but did not appear impressed by its potential.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, Paul retains {{elements}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> {{and alert}} patriarch. The painting {{is set at}} a curious angle, so that although Paul is positioned low in the pictorial space, the viewer still looks upwards towards him as if in respect. He is dressed in full pomp, wearing wide fur-lined sleeves (a typical Venetian device to convey status), and his cape is laid across his upper body to suggest physical presence.|$|E
5|$|Roger le Poer was {{a medieval}} Lord Chancellor from 1135 until 1139 for King Stephen of England. The son <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> bishop, Roger owed his {{position}} {{to his family}} connections. He lost his office when his father and other relatives lost power. Arrested along with his father, Roger was used to secure the surrender of a castle held by his mother and then disappeared from history.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the city}} of Santa Cruz already {{exhibited}} a strong conservation ethic before {{the founding of the}} university, the coincidental rise of the counterculture of the 1960s with the university's establishment fundamentally altered its subsequent development. Early student and faculty activism at UCSC pioneered an approach to environmentalism that greatly impacted the industrial development of the surrounding area. The lowering of the voting age to 18 in 1971 led to the emergence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> student-voting bloc. A large and growing population of politically liberal UCSC alumni changed the electorate of the town from predominantly Republican to markedly left-leaning, consistently voting against expansion measures {{on the part of both}} town and gown.|$|E
5|$|Astaroth's {{gameplay}} {{was developed}} around the concept <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> fighter that struck at a distance, {{and has been}} noted {{as one of the}} strongest characters in the Soul series, requiring few mistakes to be made when fighting against Astaroth to defeat him. Measures were put into effect to make the character unique by allowing the player to hold attack buttons in order to strengthen attacks, to contrast against other large character fighting styles in Soulcalibur such as Nightmare's multiple fighting stances.|$|E
5|$|Each {{season of}} Buffy the Vampire Slayer (often {{simplified}} as Buffy) presents an overall theme episodes tie into. Roz Kaveney identifies family and belonging as the overall {{theme of the}} fifth season. Buffy's mother Joyce (Kristine Sutherland) begins experiencing headaches {{at the beginning of}} the season, once collapsing and requiring hospitalization. She subsequently has a brain tumor removed. She has been recovering well. In the previous episode, she receives flowers from a male suitor, which Buffy finds at the end of that episode. The fifth season also introduces Dawn (Michelle Trachtenberg), Buffy's 14-year-old sister. Each season has a primary antagonist called the Big Bad; in the fifth season this takes the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> goddess named Glory (Clare Kramer).|$|E

5|$|Following Ruland's {{departure}} in 1863, the Queen {{looked for}} a husband for Helena. However, as a middle child, the prospect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> alliance with a European royal house was low. Her appearance was also a concern, as {{by the age of}} fifteen she was described by her biographer as chunky, dowdy and double-chinned. Furthermore, Victoria insisted that Helena's future husband had to be prepared to live near the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match was politically awkward, and caused a severe breach within the royal family.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 31st Army drove {{towards the}} Baltic coast. The 331st {{captured}} the rail junction of Landsberg from the march, and Berestov ordered the division northward, unaware {{that it was}} coming into the path <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> German counterstrike to hold open a land link {{to the rest of}} Germany. Under pressure, the 331st fell back to the outskirts of Landsberg, and savage fighting ensued. Meanwhile, the German columns led by Waffen SS troops bypassed the town to the south and north, leaving the fighting elements of the division encircled for two days until they were relieved from outside. Meanwhile, the southern German column had rampaged through the mostly-defenseless rear elements of the division, destroying the medical-sanitation battalion, the motor pool, and other units; in total more than 300 men and women were killed and more wounded.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} three months the siege {{continued}} with little significant activity on either side, until the arrival at the end of July of General François Watrin with 5,000 additional men and instructions from General Joachim Murat to prosecute the siege more vigorously. However, the arrival off Porto Ferrajo on 1 August <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> British squadron under Rear-Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren in HMS Renown, whose ship chased Bravoure and Succès as far as Leghorn and reopened the sea passage into the port, almost immediately frustrated Watrin's ambitions. At the same time, a small British force under Captain Gordon landed at Porto Ferrajo to augment the Tuscan garrison.|$|E

5|$|From the beginning, the {{alliance}} {{was much more}} valuable to the Commonwealth than to Prussia. Soon after the treaty was signed, the international situation, and changes within the Commonwealth, made the treaty much less valuable to the Prussian side. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth embarked {{on a series of}} major internal reforms, seeing {{the alliance}} as a guarantee that it had the backing <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> neighbor in this process – where in fact Prussia felt those reforms were not in its best interest, and felt threatened by them. When Russia invaded the Commonwealth in May 1792, Prussia refused a request to honor the alliance and intervene, arguing that it was not consulted with regard to the 3rd May Constitution, which invalidated the alliance. A few months later, in 1793, Prussia aided Russia in the suppression of the Kościuszko Uprising.|$|E
5|$|In 1002 King Æthelred the Unready married Emma of Normandy, {{the sister}} of Richard II, Duke of Normandy. Their son Edward the Confessor, who spent many years in exile in Normandy, succeeded to the English throne in 1042. This led to the {{establishment}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> Norman interest in English politics, as Edward drew heavily on his former hosts for support, bringing in Norman courtiers, soldiers, and clerics and appointing them to positions of power, particularly in the Church. Childless and embroiled {{in conflict with the}} formidable Godwin, Earl of Wessex and his sons, Edward may also have encouraged Duke William of Normandy's ambitions for the English throne.|$|E
5|$|Leo the Wise died in 912, and {{hostilities}} soon resumed as Simeon {{marched to}} Constantinople {{at the head}} of a large army. Though the walls of the city were impregnable, the Byzantine administration was in disarray and Simeon was invited into the city, where he was granted the crown of basileus (emperor) of Bulgaria and had the young emperor Constantine VII marry one of his daughters. When a revolt in Constantinople halted his dynastic project, he again invaded Thrace and conquered Adrianople. The Empire now faced the problem <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>powerful</b> Christian state within a few days' marching distance from Constantinople, as well as having to fight on two fronts.|$|E
