5|$|Astraeus hygrometricus, {{commonly}} known as the hygroscopic earthstar, the barometer earthstar, or the false earthstar, is a species of fungus in the family Diplocystaceae. Young specimens resemble a puffball when unopened. In maturity, the mushroom displays the characteristic earthstar shape that {{is a result of the}} outer layer of fruit body tissue splitting <b>open</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> star-like manner. The false earthstar is an ectomycorrhizal species that grows in association with various trees, especially in sandy soils. A.hygrometricus has a cosmopolitan distribution, and is common in temperate and tropical regions. Its common names refer to the fact that it is hygroscopic (water-absorbing), and can open up its rays to expose the spore sac in response to increased humidity, and close them up again in drier conditions. The rays have an irregularly cracked surface, while the spore case is pale brown and smooth with an irregular slit or tear at the top. The gleba is white initially, but turns brown and powdery when the spores mature. The spores are reddish-brown, roughly spherical with minute warts, measuring 7.5–11 micrometers in diameter.|$|E

This tournament was the only event {{of the year in}} which all the best players participated. Two months before at Wimbledon, Năstase {{narrowly}} lost to Stan Smith in an epic five-set final, {{one of the most exciting}} championship matches there. Although Smith took the title, public sympathy lay with the volatile Romanian.|$|E
25|$|Hasek roll: The Hasek roll is a desperation {{maneuver}} {{named after}} Czech goaltender Dominik Hašek. In the stacked pad stance {{the lower part}} of the net is protected very well, but the upper third is completely <b>open.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> last-ditch effort to block an incoming high shot the goaltender can roll around his upper back, flailing his pads through the air and stacking them on the other side. If the timing is right the goalie might get his leg up just in time to make the save.|$|E
25|$|In the puffballs, {{which include}} the genera Lycoperdon, Bovista, and Calvatia, spores are formed within spherical to pestle-shaped fruit bodies and are {{released}} either by wind (as the fruit body wears away, exposing the spore mass inside) or by raindrops. In the latter case, the fruit bodies develop an ostiole (apical hole) through which spores are puffed out by the pressure of raindrops falling on the fruit body surface. The same ingenious mechanism has evolved separately in the earthstars (Geastrum species), which have a hard outer layer to the fruitbody that splits <b>open</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> star-like manner to reveal the puffball-like spore sack.|$|E

25|$|Borg lost to McEnroe {{again in}} four sets {{in the final}} of the 1979 WCT Finals but was now {{overtaking}} Connors for the top ranking. Borg established himself firmly in the top spot with his fourth French Open singles title and fourth straight Wimbledon singles title, defeating Connors in a straight-set semifinal at the latter tournament. At the French Open, Borg defeated big-serving Victor Pecci in a four-set final, and at Wimbledon, Borg took five sets to overcome an even bigger server, Roscoe Tanner. Borg was upset by Tanner at the US <b>Open,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> four-set quarterfinal played under the lights. At the season-ending Masters tournament in January 1980, Borg survived a close semifinal against McEnroe. He then beat Gerulaitis in straight sets, winning his first Masters and first title in New York.|$|E
25|$|As {{the souls}} that Sam {{is sent to}} {{apprehend}} have already died once (along {{with the fact that}} they have various paranormal abilities), an attempt to capture or even kill them by a mere mortal could prove almost impossible. The Devil provides Sam with vessels to help him do his work. The vessel is usually sent for Sam to <b>open</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> wooden box which varies in shape per episode, sometimes inappropriate for the vessel they hold (i.e. a large box contained a Zippo lighter vessel) and it's usually up to Sam to figure out how to use it to capture the escaped soul assigned for him to apprehend since the vessels don't usually come with an instruction manual. All vessels are unique because each of them is intended to capture the escaped soul for whom they were created and intended to confine. The vessel could even be a seemingly living thing (e.g. a live dove).|$|E

At the Welsh Open he lost {{in the first round}} 1–4 to Ronnie O'Sullivan and he also lost {{in the first round of}} the World Open following a 3–5 defeat to John Higgins. Fu had earlier made the second 147 of his career during the final qualifying round for the World <b>Open,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> match against Matthew Selt. Fu's best performance of the season came at the UK Championship. He qualified by beating Anthony Hamilton 6–5 and then saw off Stuart Bingham 6–4 in the first round to set up a last 16 clash with world number one, Mark Selby who was the favourite to win the tournament. Fu caused a major shock by defeating the Englishman 6–3 and then went on to play Mark Allen in the quarter-finals. Fu led 5–4 in the match, but would lose the last two frames to bow out of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|The first {{post office}} opened on 1 November 1851. It {{was the first}} Victorian post office to <b>open</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gold-mining settlement. Parts of the {{district}} were first surveyed by William Urquhart as early as October 1851. By 1852 his grid plan and wide streets for land sales in the new township of West Ballarat, built upon a plateau of basalt, contrasted markedly with the existing narrow unplanned streets, tents, and gullies of the original East Ballarat settlement. The new town's main streets of the time were named in honour of police commissioners and gold commissioners of the time, with the main street, Sturt Street, named after Evelyn Pitfield Shirley Sturt; Dana Street named after Henry Dana; Lydiard Street after his assistant; Doveton Street after Francis Crossman Doveton, Ballarat's first gold commissioner; Armstrong after David Armstrong; and Mair Street after William Mair. These officials were based at the government encampment (after which nearby Camp Street was named), which was strategically positioned on an escarpment with an optimal view over the district's diggings.|$|E
25|$|Mickelson {{made his}} 2012 debut at the Humana Challenge and {{finished}} tied for 49th. He {{missed the cut}} at the Farmers Insurance Open after shooting rounds of 77 and 68. In {{the final round of}} the 2012 AT Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, Mickelson rallied from six shots back, winning the tournament by two strokes with a final round score of 8-under 64 and a four-round total of 269. The win marked his 40th career victory on the PGA Tour. The following week at Riviera Country Club, Mickelson lost the Northern Trust <b>Open</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> three-way playoff. He had held the lead or a share of it from day one until the back nine on Sunday when Bill Haas posted the clubhouse lead at seven under par. Mickelson holed a 27-foot birdie putt on the final regulation hole to force a playoff alongside Haas and Keegan Bradley. Haas however won the playoff with a 40-foot birdie putt on the second playoff hole. The second-place finish moved Mickelson back into the world's top 10.|$|E

25|$|Roddick's reign at No. 1 {{ended the}} {{following}} February, when Roger Federer ascended {{to the top}} position, after winning his first Australian Open; the 2004 Australian Open {{would be the only}} time in Roddick's career that he was the No. 1 seed in a Grand Slam. In April, Roddick again beat world No. 6 Moyá. In June, Roddick advanced to his first Wimbledon final, and after taking the first set from defending champion Federer, lost in four sets. Roddick was knocked out during the 2004 US <b>Open</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> five-set quarterfinal against another big server, Joachim Johansson. Later in September in Bangkok, he beat world No. 9 Marat Safin of Russia. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Roddick lost to Chilean Fernando González, the eventual bronze medal winner, in the third round. In November he beat world No. 7 Tim Henman of Great Britain, world No. 4 Safin, and world No. 6 Guillermo Coria. Later that year, Roddick teamed up with Mardy Fish and Bob and Mike Bryan on the U.S. Davis Cup team that lost to Spain in the final in Seville. Roddick lost his singles match against Rafael Nadal, who would in the following year win the French Open. Towards the end of 2004, Roddick fired his coach of 18 months, Brad Gilbert, and hired assistant Davis Cup coach Dean Goldfine. Roddick finished 2004 ranked as the world No. 2, the U.S. No. 1, and the player with the most aces (2,017). In 2004, Roddick saved fellow tennis player Sjeng Schalken and other guests (including close friends Ben Campezi and Dean Monroe) from a hotel fire.|$|E
25|$|Williams {{began her}} 2017 {{season at the}} ASB Classic, winning her opening match against local {{wildcard}} Jade Lewis before withdrawing due to a right arm pain. Seeded 13th at the Australian Open, Venus defeated Kateryna Kozlova, qualifier Stefanie Vögele, Duan Yingying and qualifier Mona Barthel in the opening four rounds respectively in straight sets {{to advance to the}} quarterfinals. She defeated 24th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova for her 50th win at the Australian Open, the first time Williams won a quarterfinal match in Melbourne since defeating Daniela Hantuchová in 2003. Coming back from a set down in her semifinal match, Williams defeated rising American star Coco Vandeweghe 6–7(3–7), 6–2, 6–3 to advance to her first Grand Slam final since Wimbledon 2009 and her first Australian Open final since 2003. In doing so, she set the Open Era record for the longest span (20 years) between grand slam singles final appearances, having first reached a grand slam singles final at the 1997 US <b>Open.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> closely fought final, she lost 6–4, 6–4 to her younger sister Serena Williams, who made history by winning her 23rd Grand Slam singles title, surpassing the mark set by Steffi Graf. The following week, Venus competed in the St. Petersburg Ladies' Trophy, but lost in the second round to eventual champion Kristina Mladenovic. At the Indian Wells Masters, Venus came back from 1–6, 1–4 down and saved three match points in the second round to defeat Jelena Jankovic, tying their head-to-head record at seven-all. This was her first win at Indian Wells since 2001. She defeated Lucie Safarova and qualifier Peng Shuai in the third and fourth rounds respectively, avenging her previous losses to both players. She lost to the eventual champion, Elena Vesnina, in the quarterfinals. The following week, Venus scored her first top-ten win since 2015, against Svetlana Kuznetsova in the fourth round of the Miami Open. She defeated World No. 1 Angelique Kerber in the quarterfinals, becoming the oldest player to beat a current World No. 1. She lost for a third consecutive time to eventual champion Johanna Konta in straight sets in her first semi-final in Miami since 2010. This marked her fourth consecutive loss to eventual champions.|$|E
