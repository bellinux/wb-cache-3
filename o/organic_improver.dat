As a result, there is an increased need to identify suitable organic bakery ingredients for use in bread and confectionery formulations. However, only a limited number of scientific studies on the physical, chemical and functional properties of organic flours and ingredients exist. The effects of commonly-used ingredients in baking, i. e. <b>organic</b> <b>improvers</b> and fats, on the baking characteristics of organic products have not yet been reported and little is known about the influence of approved additives that may be beneficial to organic baking. Arising from these gaps in the knowledge base on the use of organic flours and ingredients, the objective of this study was to evaluate the chemical, rheological and baking characteristics of white, wholemeal and confectionery organic flours and to assess the baking potential of organic bakery ingredients, in particular improvers, fats and additives.

40|$|End {{of project}} reportIn recent years, {{concern for the}} {{environment}} and consumer dissatisfaction with conventional food has led to growing interest in organic farming and food. The demand has also been fuelled by highly-publicised food scares. Food safety and genetic modification issues have led some consumers to opt for organic food as a safer alternative.

40|$|The {{sewage sludge}} {{is rich in}} {{nutrients}} such as nitrogen and phosphorous and contains valuable organic matter that is useful when soils are depleted or subject to erosion. The organic matter and nutrients are the two main elements that make the spreading {{of this kind of}} waste on land as a fertilizer or an <b>organic</b> soil <b>improver</b> suitable. However the sewage sludge tends to contain heavy metals and poorly biodegradable trace organic compounds as well as potentially pathogenic organisms due to its waste water treatment process origin. The present study shows the European reality concerning the sewage sludge contamination by four classes of organic contaminants, by comparing the Italian situation, data obtained in the present work, with the other European Union countries, and assess the sewage sludge suitability as soil fertilizer...|$|R
40|$|In the {{countries}} of the EU and U. S., the biological output of agricultural production increases by 20 percent annually. Biological production is obtained by using organic fertilizers or products deriving from organic waste after their composting or anaerobic fermentation for biogas production and / or soil improver by means of oxalor technology. In OXALOR technology, the organic substrate undergoes physical and chemical tra nsformation with the formation o a stable humified end product. This product is valuable for the agriculture as it is an <b>organic</b> soil <b>improver</b> and resource for improvement of the soil structure. OXALOR technology has significant ecological and agroecological advantages over other technologies analyzed. A significant advantage that makes the technology unique is the short time required for treatment of the waste, the exotermicity of the process during which the pathogenic microorganisms are destroyed and the preservation of 98 - 100...|$|R
40|$|In a farm {{devoted to}} the {{production}} of fresh-cut leafy vegetables located in Eboli (Salerno), it was carried out a trial to compare the effects on crops and soil organic carbon (SOC) of biowaste compost, olive pomace compost, buffalo manure applied to soil in two doses (15 and 30 t ha − 1 fresh weight). The amendments were tested in order to start in defining a feasible strategy for the recovery/maintenance of soils in degradation due to the organic matter depletion triggered by the intensive soil tillage and the lack of organic matter returned to soil. In the year following the soil amendment, it was studied the crop sequence: rocket-basil-rocket. Analysis of nitrates concentration in leaves of rocket was carried out on samples of all the treatments picked up in the two cycles of rocket. Along the year, we observed that the higher yields promoted {{in the first six months}} (May-September) from the dose 15 t ha − 1, were obtained with the dose 30 t ha − 1 in the successive six months (November-May). This was due, probably, to the larger stock of total N supplied with dose 30 and its release in time. Buffalo manure amendment showed a higher quickness than composts in the supplying mineral nitrogen to the first crops. On the other hand, nitrates in leaves of rocket exceeded, more frequently, the limits fixed in EU Regulation n. 1258 / 2011 in the plots amended with buffalo manure. Instead, the treatments with olive pomace compost showed to exceed rarely the EU limits. Under tunnel, the intensive management based on 4 - 5 crop cycles per year and as much soil tillage, appeared the first cause to explain the lack of significant variation in SOC of plots treated with <b>organic</b> <b>improvers</b> after one year from their distribution. This result let us to suppose the need to study some modifications of the standard farm management in order to reduce the number of soil tillage in a year and, as a consequence, the main stress causing the high carbon mineralisation rate in soil under tunnel...|$|R
40|$|Zinc oxide {{nanoparticles}} (ZnO NPs) {{are used}} {{in an array of}} products and processes, ranging from personal care products to antifouling paints, textiles, food additives, antibacterial agents and environmental remediation processes. Soils are an environment likely to be exposed to manmade nanoparticles due to the practice of applying sewage sludge as a fertiliser or as an <b>organic</b> soil <b>improver.</b> However, understanding on the interactions between soil properties, nanoparticles and the organisms that live within soil is lacking, especially with regards to soil bacterial communities. We studied the effects of nanoparticulate, non-nanoparticulate and ionic zinc (in the form of zinc chloride) on the composition of bacterial communities in soil with a modified pH range (from pH 4. 5 to pH 7. 2). We observed strong pH dependent effects on the interaction between bacterial communities and all forms of zinc, with the largest changes in bacterial community composition occurring in soils with low and medium pH levels (pH 4. 8 and 5. 9). The high pH soil (pH 7. 2) was less susceptible to the effects of zinc exposure. At the highest doses of zinc (2500 mg/kg dw soil) both nano and non-nano particulate zinc applications elicited a similar response in the soil bacterial community, and this differed significantly to the ionic zinc salt treatment. The results highlight the importance of considering soil pH in nanotoxicology studies, although further work is needed to determine the exact mechanisms controlling the toxicity and fate and interactions of nanoparticles with soil microbial communities...|$|R
40|$|In Portugal, where soils have a {{very low}} topsoil organic matter content, the use of sewage sludge (SS) as <b>organic</b> soil <b>improvers</b> seems an {{attractive}} option, because it would enable organic matter, N, P, K and other nutrients to be recycled. However, the risk of this practice must be properly assessed. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the potential risk of the use of dewatered and composted SS as soil amendments. For this purpose, SS from two different wastewater treatment plants (SS 1 and SS 2), and a compost produced from SS and agricultural wastes (AWSSC), were characterized for their total metal concentrations, organic contaminants and indicator pathogens, and used in a pot experiment with three application rates, 6, 12 and 24 ton dry matter/ha, cultivated with a hybrid variety of sorghum and Sudan grass (Sorghum bicolor × Sorghum sudanense var. Rocket). SS 1 and AWSSC met the legal requirements to be applied to soils, but SS 2 had a high content of pathogens, which compromised its use. Both dewatered SS had a marked beneficial effect on plant production and on soil nutritional characteristics, more pronounced than in the case of AWSSC application, without a significant increase in total and in mobile metals concentration in soils. Bioaccumulation factors for metals in plants were low, and their concentrations in the aboveground plant material were lower than the maximum tolerable level for cattle, used as a risk indicator of metal entry into the human food chain. However, it will be necessary, in future studies, to evaluate the potential risk of the observed increase in the mobilisable content of Cu and Zn in soil, as a consequence of the application of these organic materials. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R
40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia do Ambiente - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaThe S. Domingos mine is {{included}} in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, one of the oldest mining districts in Europe that has one of the largest concentrations of polymetallic massive sulfide deposits. This work aims to study the soil phytostabilization of heap (gossan) from S. Domingos mine, using soil <b>improvers</b> (<b>organic</b> and inorganic) and Cistus salviifolius L. (autochthonous species adapted to extreme environments). The amendments used were: biomass ash (2. 5 g/kg of the soil), mixture of organic waste (O. M., 120 soil g/kg) and mixture of both. The soil has very acid pH (3, 44 - 3, 54), high total concentrations of potentially toxic elements, As, Cu and Pb, and low concentration of organic C. The soil available fraction of elements, Al, Ca, Fe, K e Mg, is, in generally, < 8, 4 % of their total concentration in soil. The soil available fraction of As, Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn is < 4, 3 % of the total, but for V it lies between 8, 0 and 8, 3 % of the total and for Mn it lies between 21, 2 and 24, 8 %. The best vegetative development and without visible signs of toxicity, occurred in the treatments with O. M. and cinza+O. M [...] The plants are not accumulators of potentially toxic elements. It was observed high activity in the O. M. treatment of the soluble fraction and the ionically bound fraction in the ash+O. M. treatment in roots, in the Catalase (CAT) activity. As for the activity of Peroxidase (POD), the soluble fraction is slightly higher in roots than in shoots, and the ionically bounded fraction has high values both in shoots and roots. The application of amendments enables a better development of C. salviifolius and decreases the concentration of chemicals in the soil...|$|R
