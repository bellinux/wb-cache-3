5000|$|The poem first {{appeared}} in fragments in Khudozhestvennoye Slovo (Artistic Word) magazine's October 1920 issue. As a separate edition {{it came out in}} April 1921, published by Gosizdat (GIZ) without the name of the author mentioned. The reason for this anonymity was explained in the poem's first two stanzas: [...] "150 millions is the name of this poem's master / Bullet is rhythm, flame's a rhyme jumping from house to house. / 150 millions speak through my mouth / Masses marching over the stepping-stone paper is the <b>offset</b> <b>duplicator</b> machine getting these pages printed. // Who'd enquire the Moon and the Sun of what makes them bring out day and night, who’d demand the name of creator genius? / The same's with this poem: it hasn't got one single author." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the mid-1950s}} the small <b>offset</b> (<b>duplicator)</b> market was {{dominated}} by Addressograph-Multilith’s Multi-1250 almost without competition. A study undertaken by Whitin Machine Works, a manufacturer of textile making machinery looking to expand out of an industry depressed {{by the introduction of}} synthetic fabrics, suggested that “quick printing” done with duplicators was a growing market. Whitin thus acquired ATF in 1957, began to manufacture a small (10 x 15” sheet size) duplicator at their Whitinsville, Massachusetts facility, and to market this under the name ATF Chief 15. The basic design was by Louis Mestre, and it incorporated many large press features as he had free use of Webendorfer patents. As it gave large press performance, it was an immediate success with commercial printers (who were disdainful of duplicators), and the Chief line remained the best of the small presses until the introduction of Heidelberg’s T-Offset in the late 1980s. A larger Chief 17 was introduced in the 1960s and the 1970s saw “common blanket” two color models of both the 15 and 17. Both Chief models were made and sold in Europe by Gestetner Cyclograph Company, and were also marketed in the United States by the Itek and Ditto corporations.|$|E
40|$|Well-designed {{graphics}} and printing {{are essential for}} friends publications. In our service to both the library and the community, we stress the need for enlisting the most able and imaginative friends for our endeavors. We look for friends with knowledge and discrimination in expressing the library's various programs, services, and purposes. Any publication issued by the friends should reflect a warmth and grace that will motivate public interest and response for both the library and the friends. Aldous Huxley has said that "good printing can create a valuable spiritual state in the reader," the very state which we hope will promote increased receptiveness to the various projects sponsored by the friends. It {{is not uncommon for}} members of a friends organization to spend weeks or even months in analyzing, planning, and preparing lengthy annual reports, newsletters, and other publications. The investment is considerable; resulting publications should not be issued in a banal or unattractive manner. The cost of issuing a fine publication is little more than that of a mediocre one. It is merely a matter of type and graphic design, the selection of appropriate paper, and the careful use of illustrations. Today, it is practical for friends groups to produce publications at reasonable costs. Almost all libraries public, college, school, or university have at their disposal an <b>offset</b> <b>duplicator,</b> either located in the city, county, school, or college offices, or available through a local printer. Once the copy has been properly typeset, an overall design executed, and camera-ready copy prepared, any piece can be printed attractively on a limited budget. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|E
50|$|Small offset lithographic presses {{that are}} used for fast, good quality {{reproduction}} of one-color and two-color copies in sizes up to 12″ by 18″. Popular models were made by A. B. Dick Company, Multilith, and the Chief and Davidson lines made by A.T.F.-Davidson. <b>Offset</b> <b>duplicators</b> are made for fast and quick printing jobs; printing up to 12,000 impressions per hour. They are able to print business forms, letterheads, labels, bulletins, postcards, envelopes, folders, reports, and sales literature.|$|R
40|$|Driography is a planographic {{printing}} process. A driographic printing plate differs from a conventional offset lithographic plate in that water {{is not required}} to keep the non-image area clean of ink during printing. Water, or fountain solution, is not required during printing because a silicone rubber coating which repels ink is used for the non-image area of a driographic plate. The first driographic plate was introduced in the early 19702 ̆ 7 s by the 3 M Company. The plate was a positive working printing plate and has since been discontinued. Driography has since been researched by a number of companies but only one is presently marketing a driographic plate. The Toray Company, a Japanese based firm, is producing a negative working driographic printing plate. The {{purpose of this study is}} to research Toray 2 ̆ 7 s negative working driographic printing plate. It is hypothesized that as ink tack decreases, toning in the non-image area will increase. In this experiment, ink tack was monitored at the point of impression using a thermocouple device. The thermocouple was used to measure ink temperature on an inking form roller. Temperature/tack curves were developed and used to convert ink temperatures to tack readings. The actual experiment was performed on a <b>duplicator</b> <b>offset</b> printing press. A second technique using ink tack-reducer to alter ink tack was performed as an alternative test to support the initial method results. During the course of the study a number of variables could have altered the test results. These variables were monitored and kept constant during testing. The variable which affected test results most dramatically was the oil content in the ink. It was concluded that the amount of oil content in an ink had more influence on the degree of toning than ink tack did as originally hypothesized...|$|R
