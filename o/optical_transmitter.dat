40|$|Abstract—The quantum key {{distribution}} protocol uses one de-gree of freedom of a single quantum system to encode information. If this information has correlations with the system’s other degrees of freedom, or if the measurement efficiencies on the receiver side depend on them, a security loophole called side channel is created. An eavesdropper can exploit it to gain information without dis-turbing the system, and thus, without revealing the attack. Here, we analyze side channels in a free-space QKD sender and receiver implementation and focus especially on the dependencies and side channels for the spatial degree of freedom.
