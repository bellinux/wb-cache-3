5|$|Because {{of their}} great size, supertankers often cannot enter port fully loaded. These ships {{can take on}} their cargo at {{off-shore}} platforms and single-point moorings. On the other end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>journey,</b> they often pump their cargo off to smaller tankers at designated lightering points off-coast. A supertanker's routes are generally long, requiring it to stay at sea for extended periods, up to and beyond seventy days at a time.|$|E

5|$|In this period, steamships on rivers {{such as the}} Ohio and Mississippi {{or large}} inland bodies of water such as the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay offered a {{comfortable}} and relatively fast mode of transportation.

The book has been reprinted many times, mostly in Bates's own effective abridgement for the second edition, which omitted the more technical descriptions.|$|E

The main French battlefleet of 25 ships under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse would cruise the Bay of Biscay in order to challenge the British Channel Fleet if it attempted to intercept the supplies. The convoy's passage was expected to take approximately two months, and it included 117 merchant ships carrying enough food to feed France for a year.|$|E
