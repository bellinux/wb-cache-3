5|$|A {{study of}} trace {{elements}} in mushrooms {{in the eastern}} Black Sea Region of Turkey found E.sinuatum to have {{the highest levels of}} copper (64.8 ± 5.9μg/g dried material—insufficient to be toxic) and zinc (198μg/g) recorded. Caps and stalks tested in an area with high levels of mercury in southeastern Poland showed it to bioaccumulate much higher levels of mercury than other fungi. The element was also found in high levels in the humus-rich substrate. Entoloma sinuatum also accumulates arsenic-containing compounds. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roughly</b> 40μg of arsenic present per gram of fresh mushroom tissue, about 8% was arsenite and the other 92% was arsenate.|$|E
5|$|Human {{attitudes toward}} insects are often negative, {{reinforced}} by sensationalism in the media. This {{has produced a}} society that attempts to eliminate insects from daily life. For example, nearly 75 million pounds of broad-spectrum insecticides are manufactured and sold each year for use in American homes and gardens. Annual revenues from insecticide sales to homeowners exceeded $450 million in 2004. Out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roughly</b> a million species of insects described so far, not more than 1,000 {{can be regarded as}} serious pests, and less than 10,000 (about 1%) are even occasional pests. Yet not one species of insect has been permanently eradicated through the use of pesticides. Instead, at least 1,000 species have developed field resistance to pesticides, and extensive harm has been done to beneficial insects including pollinators such as bees.|$|E

5|$|In 1961, the FNLA and the MPLA, {{based in}} {{neighbouring}} countries, began a guerrilla campaign against Portuguese rule on several fronts. The Portuguese Colonial War, {{which included the}} Angolan War of Independence, lasted until the Portuguese regime's overthrow in 1974 through a leftist military coup in Lisbon. When the timeline for independence became known, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roughly</b> 500,000 ethnic Portuguese Angolans fled the territory during the weeks before or after that deadline. Portugal left behind a newly independent country whose population was mainly composed by Ambundu, Ovimbundu, and Bakongo peoples.

5|$|<b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>roughly</b> eight parrot species {{endemic to}} the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet has survived. The others were likely all made extinct by a {{combination}} of excessive hunting and deforestation by humans. Leguat stated that Newton's parakeet was abundant during his stay. It was still common when Tafforet visited in 1726, but when Alexandre Pingré mentioned it in 1761, he noted that the bird had become scarce. It was still present on southern islets off Rodrigues (Isle Gombrani), along with the Rodrigues parrot. After this point, much of Rodrigues was severely deforested and used for livestock.|$|E
