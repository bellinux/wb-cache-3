25|$|Another {{critique}} {{points to}} the privileging <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> over personal political choice. Howard has deemed consociationalism {{as a form of}} ethnocracy and not a path to true pluralistic democracy. Consociationalism assumes that a politician will best represent the will of his co-ethnics above other political parties. This might lead to the polarization of ethnic groups and the loss of non-ethnic ideological parties.|$|E
25|$|Turkey {{does not}} appear to be the scene of {{large-scale}} or overt expressions of racism against individuals in the strictest sense of term. However, one of the main challenges facing Turkey in the field of ECRI's (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance) concerns would appear to be the need to reconcile the strong sense of national identity and the wish to preserve the unity and integrity of the State with the right of different minority groups within Turkey to express their own sense <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity,</b> for example through the maintenance and development of linguistic and cultural aspects of that identity.|$|E

40|$|Ethnicity {{remains one}} of the most salient layers of individuals' social identities, and {{information}} about the distribution <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> turns out to be crucial for many studies that investigate political or social processes in divided societies. In the aftermath of civil wars, however, censuses providing such data are controversial and often delayed. Where census data are lacking, researchers can make use of the multiplier method to infer the distribution <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> based on indirect observations from sub-samples of the population. However, due to the selective nature of their data, the sub-samples might not be representative of the population. This paper proposes a method, which corrects for such selection effects. Based on the <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> <b>of</b> birth-giving parents, the authors estimate the distribution <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> in the municipalities of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina for 2008 – 2010. They correct for possible selection biases by including economic, demographic and war-related variables. Multiple tests of validity show that this estimation appears to be the most accurate procedure currently available for the distribution <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> in municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{process of}} {{emigration}} and immigration in this 21 st century {{has resulted in}} a remarkable population change across national borders. This trend has led to the re-assertion <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> and the attention on ethnic differences as an important agenda for many societies. Accordingly, <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> have become relevant in how we understand the process of communication between diverse people in this global world. Despite the consciousness <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities,</b> the tendency to approach intercultural communication through the lens of nationality remains dominant in the field. As researchers are influenced by the idea that “national culture” is shared by all cultural members, utilizing nationality as the unit of analysis often forces researchers to analyse the unifying elements that describe the whole populations and ignore differences between groups. Consequently, such tendency has led researchers to utilize homogenizing views in their analysis, hence simplifying the complex nature of heterogeneous environment where people <b>of</b> different <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> may co-exist. As such, scholars have pointed out that <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> are not fully addressed in the analysis of intercultural communication. This study explores the representation <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> in intercultural experiences among diverse students in a Malaysian university. In-depth phenomenological interviews were conducted with fifteen participants. Two themes emerged from the data analysis that elucidates the intricate nature <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> in students’ intercultural experiences: (i) identifying self as an ethnic being and (ii) encountering differences between self and the other. The central metaphorical interpretation that emerged from this study, that is, “what they do that we don’t do”, recognizes not only participants’ consciousness <b>of</b> their <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> that filter their interpretations of selves and the other in their communication, but also consciousness of dissimilar communication behaviours. The findings of this study offer an interesting insight on <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> as it is situated within students’ intercultural experiences. It contributes into thinking through the complex representation <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> as a framework for understanding the process of intercultural communication...|$|R
25|$|The {{long-term}} {{exposure to}} the disintegration processes and Italian foreign language surrounding, as well absence of cultural institutions, resulted with the loss <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity.</b> The ethnic identity of Molise Croats consists of common language, personal names and toponyms, common customs (living and dressing), as well oral tradition of migration. In 1904 was founded Slavenska knjižnica (Biblioteca Slava) in Acquaviva Collecroce, from 1968 was released journal Naš jezik, and again between 1986–1988 as Naš život in Slavomolisano dialect. From 2002 is released journal Riča živa. Local amateur associations preserve the tradition, folklore and language. In 1999 was founded Foundation Agostina Piccoli, which in 2002 was officially recognized by Italy as institution for preservation and protection of Molise Croats culture and tradition.|$|E
25|$|Ethnic {{background}} {{is an important}} factor in Lebanon. The country encompasses a great mix of cultural, religious, and ethnic groups which have been building up for more than 6,000 years. The Arabs invaded and occupied Phoenicia in the 7th century AD from Arabia. The predominant cultural backgrounds and ancestry of the Lebanese vary from Aramaean (Ancient Syria) to Canaanite (Phoenician), and Greek (Byzantine). Lebanese are overall genetically similar to the people of Cyprus and Malta and to the other modern Levantine populations, such as the Syrians, Israelis and Palestinians. The question <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> has come to revolve more around aspects of cultural self-identification more than descent. Religious affiliation has also become a substitute in some respects for ethnic affiliation.|$|E
25|$|However, in cities, {{where the}} {{population}} {{tends to be}} much higher, informal interactions between ethnic groups might {{not be sufficient to}} prevent violence. This is because you need many more links to connect everyone and therefore it is much more difficult to form and strengthen inter-ethnic ties. In cities, formal inter-ethnic associations like trade unions, business associations and professional organizations are more effective in encouraging inter-ethnic interactions that could prevent ethnic violence in the future. These organizations force ethnic groups to come together based on shared economic interests that overcomes any pre-existing ethnic differences. For example, inter-ethnic business organizations serve to connect the business interests of different ethnic groups which would increase their desire to maintain ethnic harmony. Any ethnic tension or outbreak of violence will go against their economic interests and therefore, over time, the salience <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> diminishes.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the influence of}} ideological and scholarly-ethnographic classification schemes, {{as well as those}} pertaining to population censuses, on the formation <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities</b> and <b>ethnic</b> structure in Civil Croatia and Slavonia from 1785 to 1860. Proceeding from the theory of social systems and institutions, the author examines the power of classification schemes and their influence on the construction <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities.</b> It has been shown that changes in social orders also lead to changes in the principles of constructing classification schemes. Thus, in the modern social order, the combination of commonsensical, ideological, scholarly and official statistic classification schemes {{led to the creation of}} a specific ethno-nationalist discourse, which strongly influenced the formation <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identities,</b> overcoming traditional <b>ethnic</b> particularities and formation <b>of</b> modern <b>ethnic</b> communities on the territories of Civil Croatia and Slavonia in the early modern period...|$|R

25|$|In 2008, IBGE {{published}} {{a book about the}} Japanese diaspora and it estimated that, as of 2000, there were 1,405,685 people of Japanese descent in Brazil. The Japanese immigration was concentrated to São Paulo and, still in 2000, 49.3% of Japanese Brazilians lived in this state. There were 693,495 people of Japanese origin in São Paulo, followed by Paraná with 143,588. More recently, Brazilians of Japanese descent are making presence in places that used to have a small population of this group. For example: in 1960, there were 532 Japanese Brazilians in Bahia, while in 2000 they were 78,449, or 0.6% of the state’s population. Northern Brazil (excluding Pará) saw its Japanese population increase from 2,341 in 1960 (0.2% of the total population) to 54,161 (0.8%) in 2000. During the same period, in Central-Western Brazil they increased from 3,582 to 66,119 (0.7% of the population). However, the overall Japanese population in Brazil is shrinking, secondary to a decreased birth rate and an aging population; return immigration to Japan, as well as intermarriage with other races and dilution <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity.</b>|$|E
25|$|In addition, many non-Russians {{who lived}} outside their {{respective}} administrative units tended to become Russified linguistically; that is, {{they not only}} learned Russian {{as a second language}} but they also adopted it as their home language or mother tongue – although some still retained their sense <b>of</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>identity</b> or origins even after shifting their native language to Russian. This includes both the traditional communities (e.g., Lithuanians in the northwestern Belarus (see Eastern Vilnius region) or the Kaliningrad Oblast (see Lithuania Minor)) and the communities that appeared during Soviet times such as Ukrainian or Belarusian workers in Kazakhstan or Latvia, whose children attended primarily the Russian-language schools and thus the further generations are primarily speaking Russian as their native language; for example, for 57% of Estonia's Ukrainians, 70% of Estonia's Belarusians and 37% of Estonia's Latvians claimed Russian is the native language in the last Soviet census of 1989. Russian language as well replaced Yiddish and other languages as the main language of many Jewish communities inside the Soviet Union.|$|E
