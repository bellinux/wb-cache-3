5|$|Nichols {{left the}} Atomic Energy Commission in 1955 {{and opened a}} {{consulting}} firm on K Street, specializing in commercial atomic energy research and development. His clients included Alcoa, Gulf Oil, Westinghouse Electric Corporation and the Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station. Nichols was involved {{with the construction of}} the Yankee Rowe Nuclear Power Station, the first privately owned pressurized-water plant, and the Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant, which commenced operation in 1961 and 1968 respectively. They were both experimental and not expected to be competitive with coal and oil, but later became more so due to inflation and large increases in coal and oil prices. He was critical of <b>over-regulation</b> and protracted hearings, which meant that by the 1980s similar boiling-water or pressurized-water plants took almost twice as long to build in the United States as in France, Japan, Taiwan or South Korea.|$|E
25|$|The New York Central, {{like many}} U.S. railroads, {{declined}} after the Second World War. Problems resurfaced that had plagued the railroad industry before the war, such as <b>over-regulation</b> by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), which severely regulated the rates {{charged by the}} railroad, along with continuing competition from automobiles. These problems were coupled with even more formidable forms of competition, such as airline service in the 1950s that began to deprive the NYC of its long-distance passenger trade. The Interstate Highway Act of 1956 helped create a network of efficient roads for motor vehicle travel through the country, enticing more people to travel by car, as well as haul freight by truck. The 1959 opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway adversely affected NYC freight business. Container shipments could now be directly shipped to ports along the Great Lakes, eliminating the railroads' freight hauls between {{the east and the}} Midwest.|$|E
2500|$|Caijing {{said the}} crisis {{revealed}} {{that there had}} been a [...] "serious dereliction of duty" [...] at the AQSIQ, and that the government had failed as a [...] "night watchman". Citing public consensus that government should limit itself to a supervisory role, it urged the construction of a regulatory system which addressed the role of regulators watching over the production process, avoiding <b>over-regulation,</b> 'regulatory capture' and abuse of power by regulators. [...] "Keeping the market in order and ensuring independent law enforcement should be part of the mandate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, the Governor's [...] "cook shack" [...] {{difficulties}} and crusade against superfluous rulemaking, government red-tape and <b>over-regulation</b> {{set the stage}} for an overhaul of Florida's Administrative Procedures Act, reforms the legislature had been attempting for several years. [...] In addition to sponsoring the Bert Harris Act in 1995, Pruitt was the prime sponsor of the APA legislation. While the act was vetoed by Chiles in 1995 as being too burdensome for the implementing agencies, it was passed the following year, making the first major reforms to Florida's APA since its inception in 1974.|$|E
2500|$|Local {{conditions}} {{also affect}} exports; [...] state <b>over-regulation</b> in several African nations can prevent their own exports from becoming competitive. Research in Public Choice economics {{such as that}} of Jane Shaw suggest that protectionism operates in tandem with heavy State intervention combining to depress economic development. Farmers subject to import and export restrictions cater to localized markets, exposing them to higher market volatility and fewer opportunities. When subject to uncertain market conditions, farmers press for governmental intervention to suppress competition in their markets, resulting in competition being driven out of the market. As competition is driven out of the market, farmers innovate less and grow less food further undermining economic performance.|$|E
2500|$|After {{passage of}} the CWA in 1972, a {{controversy}} arose as to its application to agriculture and certain other activities. [...] The Act was interpreted by some to place restrictions on virtually all placement of dredged materials in wetlands and other waters of the United States, raising concern {{that the federal government}} was about to place all agricultural activities {{under the jurisdiction of the}} U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). For opponents of the Act, section 404 had, as a result of this concern, become a symbol of dramatic <b>over-regulation.</b> When Congress considered the 1977 CWA Amendments, a significant issue was to ensure that certain agricultural activities and other selected activities, could continue without the government’s supervision—in other words, completely outside the regulatory or permit jurisdiction of any federal agency.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992 as a Republican {{and member}} of the {{minority}} party in the Florida House, Pruitt teamed with veteran Representative and Democrat, Bert J. Harris Jr., in an effort to address the <b>over-regulation</b> and ownership rights of privately owned property. [...] After two unsuccessful pushes to pass their Private Property Rights Protection Act, the two Representatives caught the break they needed in the third year. [...] Prior to the 1995 Florida Legislative Session, Governor Lawton Chiles, having recently experienced a regulatory roadblock when he attempted to build a “cook shack” on his own private property, was ready to support the lawmakers' efforts. The Governor’s momentum helped enabled the two representatives to pass the bill (CS/HB 863 - 1995) through both chambers with only a single dissenting vote. [...] Representative Pruitt honored his partner and friend by renaming the bill the Bert J. Harris Jr. Private Property Rights Protection Act. Governor Chiles signed the act on May 18, 1995 and the Bert Harris Act has since served as a model to other states addressing environmental and land use regulation in respect to the rights of private property owners.|$|E
2500|$|Agriculture is an {{important}} part of the Indian economy. At around , India has the second-largest amount of arable land, after the US, with 52% of total land under cultivation. Although the total land area of the country is only slightly more than one third of China or the US, India's arable land is marginally smaller than that of the US, and marginally larger than that of China. However, agricultural output lags far behind its potential. The low productivity in India is a result of several factors. According to the World Bank, India's large agricultural subsidies are distorting what farmers grow and hampering productivity-enhancing investment. <b>Over-regulation</b> of agriculture has increased costs, price risks and uncertainty, and governmental intervention in labour, land, and credit are hurting the market. Infrastructure such as rural roads, electricity, ports, food storage, retail markets and services remain inadequate. The average size of land holdings is very small, with 70% of holdings being less than one hectare (2.5acres) in size. Irrigation facilities are inadequate, as revealed by the fact that only 46% of the total cultivable land was irrigated [...] resulting in farmers still being dependent on rainfall, specifically the monsoon season, which is often inconsistent and unevenly distributed across the country. In an effort to bring an additional two crore hectares (20 million hectares; 50 million acres) of land under irrigation, various schemes have been attempted, including the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) which was provided 80,000 crore (800 billion) in the union budget. Farming incomes are also hampered by lack of food storage and distribution infrastructure; a third of India's agricultural production is lost from spoilage.|$|E
60|$|This liberal form of {{domestic}} government, {{which does not}} seek despotically to regulate {{all the details of}} a child's conduct, necessarily results from the system we advocate. Satisfy yourself with seeing that your child always suffers the natural consequences of his actions, and you will avoid that excess of control in which so many parents err. Leave him wherever you can to the discipline of experience, and you will save him from that hot-house virtue which <b>over-regulation</b> produces in yielding natures, or that demoralising antagonism which it produces in independent ones.|$|E
6000|$|As the {{government}} judge that the illegality of <b>over-regulation</b> [...] prices cannot continue, {{and as they}} can only be extinguished by [...] {{putting an end to}} purchase, what has been chiefly considered is [...] how to proceed with the greatest certainty and the smallest shock, [...] and how to secure as far as may be for the officers all that has [...] hitherto been asked on their behalf. With this view, the [...] government think the first step would be to abolish the warrant [...] under which prices of commissions are fixed. As the resolution of [...] the House of Lords states the unwillingness of the House to take [...] part in abolishing purchase until certain things shall have been [...] done, it would not be applicable to a case in which, without its [...] interposition, purchase would have been already abolished.|$|E

Did not the vote of the House of Lords stop us in this [...] best manner of proceeding? 5. Did it absolve us from the duty of [...] {{putting an end to}} the illegality? 6. What method of putting an end [...] to it remained to us, except that which we have adopted? ...|$|E

50|$|Issues {{regarding}} {{corruption in}} India {{have become increasingly}} prominent in recent years. The country was subject to socialist-inspired economic policies dating from independence in 1947 until the 1980s. <b>Over-regulation,</b> protectionism, and government ownership of industry led to slow economic growth, high unemployment, and widespread poverty. This system of bureaucratic control by government is called the License Raj and lies {{at the core of}} endemic corruption.|$|E
50|$|All {{political}} finance regimes require {{authorities and}} agencies {{that are responsible}} for monitoring, control and enforcement.

Global research shows that highly sophisticated rules, <b>over-regulation</b> of some issues and lax implementation of such rules do not lead to best practice.|$|E
5000|$|Government housing policies, <b>over-{{regulation}},</b> failed {{regulation and}} deregulation {{have all been}} claimed as causes of the crisis, along with many others.

50|$|This {{has led to}} {{repeated}} criticism from employers that labour markets are over-regulated, and that the costs and obligations of hiring labour weigh too heavily on employers. Moreover, {{it is argued that}} <b>over-regulation</b> prevents the free movement of labour to where it is really necessary.

50|$|The {{impairment}} of {{cerebral blood flow}} that underlies hypertensive encephalopathy is still controversial. Normally, cerebral blood flow is maintained by an autoregulation mechanism that dilate arterioles in response to blood pressure decreases and constricts arterioles in response to blood pressure increases. This autoregulation falters when hypertension becomes excessive. According to the <b>over-regulation</b> conception, brain vessels spasm in response to acute hypertension, which results in cerebral ischemia and cytotoxic edema. According to the autoregulation breakthrough conception, cerebral arterioles are forced to dilate, leading to vasogenic edema.|$|E
