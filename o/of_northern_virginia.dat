At 8:30 A.M. that morning, Lee requested a meeting with Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant to discuss surrendering the Army <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Virginia.</b> Shortly after twelve o'clock, Grant's reply reached Lee, and in it Grant said he would accept the surrender of the Confederate Army under certain conditions. Lee then rode into the little hamlet of Appomattox Court House, where the Appomattox county court house stood, and waited for Grant's arrival to surrender his army.|$|E

5|$|After the {{surrender}} of General Robert E.

Fort Corcoran fell into the third-class category.|$|E

5|$|Around 1 p.m., from 150 to 170 Confederate guns {{began an}} {{artillery}} bombardment {{that was probably}} the largest of the war. In order to save valuable ammunition for the infantry attack that they knew would follow, the Army of the Potomac's artillery, under the command of Brig. Gen. Henry Jackson Hunt, at first did not return the enemy's fire. After waiting about 15 minutes, about 80 U.S. cannons added to the din. The Army <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Virginia</b> was critically low on artillery ammunition, and the cannonade did not significantly affect the Union position.|$|E

5|$|Lee’s army {{fought a}} series of battles in the Appomattox Campaign against Grant that {{ultimately}} stretched thin his lines of defense.

Grant then took advantage of the situation and launched attacks on this thirty mile long poorly defended front. This ultimately led to the surrender of Lee and the Army <b>of</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Virginia</b> at Appomattox.|$|E
