40|$|Background. Medicinal {{plants have}} proved {{at all times}} to be a {{powerful}} remedy for health care. Accordingly, grape seed, sesame, and fenugreek extracted oils with pharmacological properties are investigated as wound treatments. This study assesses the potential of <b>our</b> <b>oils</b> for healing wounds induced on rats. Methods. Phytochemical analyses of oils have involved: quality value, polyphenol, chlorophylls, carotene, and fatty acids. Antibacterial activity was carried out. Antioxidant activity was evaluated: the scavenging effect on DPPH radicals, the reducing power, and β-carotene discoloration. Uniform wound excision was induced on rats dorsum randomly divided into five groups: groups treated with “CICAFLORA®” and tested oils and untreated one. The posthealing biopsies were histologically assessed. Results. Wound biopsies treated with oils showed the best tissue regeneration compared to control groups. Groups treated with <b>our</b> <b>oils</b> and “CICAFLORA” had higher wound contraction percentage. Polyunsaturated fatty acids in oils act as inflammatory mediators increasing neovascularization, extracellular remodeling, migration, and cell differentiation. Wound healing effect was attributed to antibacterial and antioxidant synergy. Conclusion. According to findings, oils showed better activity in wound healing compared to “CICAFLORA” due to a phytoconstituents synergy. However, clinical trials on humans are necessary to confirm efficacy on human pathology...|$|R

During the 2008 presidential campaign, in November 2007 {{when all of}} the Democratic presidential candidates were calling for eliminating billions of dollars of tax breaks for oil companies, Romney told the New York Times, [...] "Now is not the right time to raise taxes on <b>our</b> <b>oil</b> companies." [...] Throughout most of the 2012 presidential campaign, Romney himself made almost no public statements directly commenting on tax breaks for oil and gas companies; and the Romney campaign declined to respond to repeated requests from the Tampa Bay Times Politifact and The Washington Post's Fact Checker to clarify his position. However, he did tell a town hall gathering in April 2012 that, in contrast to Obama, {{he did not want to}} raise taxes on oil companies. Romney's chief energy advisor also testified before Congress twice during the campaign on behalf of the oil and gas industry that Congress should maintain tax benefits for oil and gas producers. During the first presidential debate between Romney and Obama, in October 2012, Romney hinted for the first time that as president he might consider eliminating $2.8 billion in tax breaks for oil and gas producers if Congress would agree to cut the tax rate for all corporations by 30%.|$|E

6000|$|He {{had shot}} away {{more than half}} his torpedoes, and so had I, and yet we were very averse from {{returning}} to our base so long as <b>our</b> <b>oil</b> held out. I told him of my experience with the Boston steamer, and we mutually agreed to sink the ships by gun-fire in future so far as possible. I remember old Horli saying, [...] "What use is a gun aboard a submarine?" [...] We were about to show. I read the English paper to Stephan {{by the light of}} my electric torch, and we both agreed that few ships would now come up the Channel. That sentence about diverting commerce to safer routes could only mean that the ships would go round the North of Ireland and unload at Glasgow. Oh, for two more ships to stop that entrance! Heavens, what would England have done against a foe with thirty or forty submarines, since we only needed six instead of four to complete her destruction! After much talk we decided that the best plan would be that I should dispatch a cipher telegram next morning from a French port to tell them to send the four second-rate boats to cruise off the North of Ireland and West of Scotland. Then when I had done this I should move down Channel with Stephan and operate at the mouth, while the other two boats could work in the Irish Sea. Having made these plans, I set off across the Channel in the early morning, reaching the small village of Etretat, in Brittany. There I got off my telegram and then laid my course for Falmouth, passing under the keels of two British cruisers which were making eagerly for Etretat, having heard by wireless that we were there.|$|E
6000|$|... 104. The vignettes in {{the first}} named volumes (considering the Italy and Poems as one book) I believe to be as {{skillful}} and tender as any hand work, of the kind, ever done; they are also wholly free from affectation of overwrought fineness, on the one side, and from hasty or cheap expediencies on the other; and they were produced, under the direction and influence of a gentleman and a scholar. Multitudes of works, imitative of these, and far more attractive, have been produced since; but none of any sterling quality: the good books were (I was told) a loss to their publisher, and the money spent since {{in the same manner}} has been wholly thrown away. Yet these volumes are enough to show what lovely service line engraving might be put upon, if the general taste were advanced enough to desire it. Their vignettes from Stothard, however conventional, show in the grace and tenderness of their living subjects how types of innocent beauty, as pure as Angelico's, and far lovelier, might indeed be given from modern English life, to exalt the conception of youthful dignity and sweetness in every household. I know nothing among the phenomena of the present age more sorrowful than that the beauty of our youth should remain wholly unrepresented in Fine Art, because unfelt by ourselves; and that the only vestiges of a likeness to it should be in some of the more subtle passages of caricatures, popular (and justly popular) as much because they were the only attainable reflection of the prettiness, as because they were the only sympathizing records of the humors, of English girls and boys. Of <b>our</b> <b>oil</b> portraits of them, in which their beauty is always conceived as consisting in a fixed simper--feet not more than two inches long, and accessory grounds, pony, and groom--our sentence need not be [...] "guarda e passa," [...] but [...] "passa" [...] only. Yet one oil picture has been painted, and so far as I know, one only, representing the deeper loveliness of English youth--the portraits of the three children of the Dean of Christ Church, by the son of the great portrait painter, who has recorded whatever is tender and beautiful in the faces of the aged men of England, bequeathing, as it seems, the beauty of their children to the genius of his child.|$|E

3000|$|Natural gas {{will promote}} the new {{development}} of {{the oil and gas}} industry After a long period of growth, <b>our</b> country’s <b>oil</b> production will inevitably begin to decline, which requires new resources to be in place in order to meet continuous economic development. In 2020, China’s natural gas production will exceed that of the oil, and peak gas will come later with a much higher yield, providing a richer source of energy than oil. Therefore, under the current circumstances, natural gas is the best strategic resource to replace the petroleum resources. Oilfields discovered in last century like Daqing and the Bohai Bay Basin have contributed to the substantial increase of <b>our</b> country’s <b>oil</b> production and reserves, prompting the first rapid development of China’s oil and gas industry; whereas now, when oil production lacks steam in growth and may soon begin to fall, natural gas, being an important substitute resource, will promote the new development of China’s oil and gas industry through its rapidly growing production and ever rising status.|$|R
