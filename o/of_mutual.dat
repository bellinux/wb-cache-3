While presumably owning the property outright originally, it is generally agreed that at some, uncertain date, they acquired a feudal obligation to the Campbells of Breadalbane.

5|$|Four major Chinese-speech {{groups are}} {{represented}} in Indonesia: Hokkien, Mandarin, Hakka and Cantonese. In addition to these, the Teochew people speak their own dialect that has some degree <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> intelligibility with Hokkien. Distinctions between the two, however, are accentuated outside of their regions of origin. There were an estimated 2.2 million native speakers of various Chinese varieties in Indonesia in 1982: 1,300,000 speakers of Southern Min varieties (including Hokkien and Teochew); 640,000 Hakka speakers; 460,000 Mandarin speakers; 180,000 Cantonese speakers; and 20,000 speakers of the Eastern Min varieties (including Fuzhou dialect). Additionally, an estimated 20,000 spoke different dialects of the Indonesian language.|$|E
5|$|King {{vultures}}, which {{lack the}} ability to smell carrion, follow the greater yellow-headed vultures to carcasses, where the king vulture tears open {{the skin of the}} dead animal. This allows the smaller greater yellow-headed vulture access to food, as it does not have a bill strong enough to tear the hide of larger animals. This is an example <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> dependence between species. It is generally displaced from carcasses by both turkey vultures and king vultures, due to their larger size.|$|E
40|$|The Common Agricultural Policy {{currently}} {{allows the}} support of agricultural insurance, with a particular focus on mutuals. This article analyses the experience <b>of</b> <b>mutuals</b> in the Netherlands over the past 20 years. A total <b>of</b> nine <b>mutuals</b> are reviewed, some operating on a purely private basis, others receiving some form of public support. Results illustrate that mutuals are well equipped to insure risks that are uninsurable in the commercial market. This {{is especially true for}} animal and crop disease risks. Mutuals are furthermore able to fulfil the EU conditions for receiving premium support hence opening up the opportunity for farmers to insure against multi-peril weather risks. Experience has however demonstrated that mutuals are not always successful, even with substantial public support. Lack of members caused several mutuals to be discontinued only a few years after their foundation. In order to secure the benefits <b>of</b> <b>mutuals,</b> it is shown {{that there is a need}} to carefully balance size of risk, affordability of premiums, financial robustness and solidarity. These issues are even more important in the case <b>of</b> <b>mutuals</b> providing income stabilisation tools as these have the added responsibility of data and (classified) market information management...|$|R

5|$|The clique problem {{arises in}} the {{following}} real-world setting. Consider a social network, where the graph's vertices represent people, and the graph's edges represent mutual acquaintance.

Along with its applications in social networks, the clique problem also has many applications in bioinformatics and computational chemistry.|$|E

5|$|By many general {{criteria}} <b>of</b> <b>mutual</b> intelligibility, the Continental Scandinavian languages {{could very well}} be considered dialects of a common Scandinavian language. However, because of several hundred years of sometimes quite intense rivalry between Denmark and Sweden, including a long series of wars from the 16th to 18th centuries, and the nationalist ideas that emerged during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the languages have separate orthographies, dictionaries, grammars, and regulatory bodies. Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish are thus from a linguistic perspective more accurately described as a dialect continuum of Scandinavian (North Germanic), and some of the dialects, such as those on the border between Norway and Sweden, especially parts of Bohuslän, Dalsland, western Värmland, western Dalarna, Härjedalen, Jämtland and Scania, could be described as intermediate dialects of the national standard languages.|$|E
