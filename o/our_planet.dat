5|$|This list {{of space}} telescopes (astronomical space observatories) is grouped by major {{frequency}} ranges: gamma ray, x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, microwave and radio. Telescopes {{that work in}} multiple frequency bands are included {{in all of the}} appropriate sections. Space telescopes that collect particles, such as cosmic ray nuclei and/or electrons, as well as instruments that aim to detect gravitational waves, are also listed. Missions with specific targets within the Solar System (e.g. our Sun and its planets), are excluded; see List of Solar System probes for these, and List of Earth observation satellites for missions targeting <b>our</b> <b>planet.</b>|$|E

25|$|Technoliberalism is a {{political}} philosophy founded on ideas of liberty, individuality, responsibility, decentralization, and self-awareness.

Its core beliefs fit under five main interests that include Construction of the Government, Economics, Civil Liberties, Education and Science, and Environment. Technoliberals support such ideas as balance of powers in the government, decentralization, affordable education, the protection of <b>our</b> <b>planet,</b> Fine Arts, and the freedom of speech and communication technologies.|$|E
25|$|Only about 50° of {{the martian}} phase curve can be {{observed}} from Earth because it orbits farther from the Sun than <b>our</b> <b>planet.</b> There is an opposition surge but it is less pronounced than that of Mercury. The rotation of bright and dark surface markings across its disk and variability of its atmospheric state (including its dust storms) superimpose variations on the phase curve. R. Schmude obtained many of the Mars brightness measurements used in a comprehensive phase curve analysis performed by A. Mallama.|$|E
25|$|Comprehensive human {{security}} attempts to unify environmental security together with social (societal) security. A {{great number of}} intertwined environmental and social components together create the framework for comprehensive {{human security}} {{under the assumption that}} neither of those two categories is attainable in the long run without synergy between the two. That is to say that the trends in environmental, resource, and population stresses are intensifying and will increasingly determine the quality of human life on <b>our</b> <b>planet</b> and as such are a large determining factor of our social security.|$|E

25|$|We're all {{involved}} in this: our whole {{way of life}} is structured around the burning of fossil fuels. I find it sobering to think that while I've been travelling the world, trying to record the complexity and beauty of <b>our</b> <b>planet,</b> that I too have been making my own contribution to global warming. As I recognised when I presented Life on Earth all those years ago, we are a flexible and innovative species and we have the capacity to adapt and modify our behaviour. Now we most certainly have to do so if we're to deal with climate change. It's the biggest challenge we have yet faced.|$|E
25|$|Current UN {{projections}} show {{a continued}} increase in {{population in the}} near future (but a steady decline in the population growth rate), with the global population expected to reach between 8.3 and 10.9 billion by 2050. Estimates by the UN Population Division for the year 2150 range between 3.2 and 24.8 billion; mathematical modeling supports the lower estimate. Some analysts have questioned the sustainability of further world population growth, highlighting the growing pressures on the environment, global food supplies, and energy resources. Solutions for feeding the nine billion in the future are being studied and documented. One out of every seven people on <b>our</b> <b>planet</b> go to sleep hungry. People are suffering due to overpopulation, 25,000 people die of malnutrition and hunger related diseases everyday.|$|E
25|$|At a {{fundamental}} level, marine life helps determine {{the very nature}} of <b>our</b> <b>planet.</b> Marine life resources provide food (especially food fish), medicines, and raw materials. It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the carbon cycle) and of air (such as Earth's respiration, and movement of energy through ecosystems including the ocean). Marine organisms contribute significantly to the oxygen cycle, and are involved in the regulation of the Earth's climate. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land.|$|E

50|$|Jules Verne's Voyages et Aventures du Capitaine Hatteras (Journeys and Adventures of Captain Hatteras, 1866) briefly {{alludes to}} then-current {{hypothesis}} of an antediluvian cometary collision with Earth, responsible for shifting <b>our</b> <b>planet's</b> rotation axis.|$|R
25|$|This is {{so because}} the energy {{released}} in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, {{is proportional to}} the area of the fault that ruptures and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending down into the hot mantle, are the only parts of <b>our</b> <b>planet</b> which can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about 300 degrees Celsius flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes. The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1000nbsp&km. Examples are the earthquakes in Chile, 1960; Alaska, 1957; Sumatra, 2004, all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault (1857, 1906), the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey (1939) and the Denali Fault in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter.|$|E
500|$|Blumenauer {{referred}} to the Trump administration in his speech, saying, [...] "We have failed {{in the political process}} because they've made science partisan. They've undermined the credibility and confidence that people have, for example in science, dealing with climate." [...] He also spoke about the importance of evidence-based decision making. In her speech, Bonamici said science should not be a partisan issue, and told the crowd: [...] "We are {{going to go back to}} Washington, D.C., with all of you in our mind [...] this beautiful sea of science supporters, and fight for research, fight for science, fight for clean air, fight for clean water, and fight for <b>our</b> <b>planet.</b> So stay engaged, please.
