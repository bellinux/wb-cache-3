From the findings, the five {{the most significant}} motivations {{were found to be}} improving player experience, confidence, knowledge about a particular game, socializing and creating an 'escape' or distraction from their everyday life. Walkthroughs may also guide players throughout an entire game or only certain sections and may be guides on finding rare collectables or unlocking achievements.|$|E
5|$|Sintering powders of {{samarium}} oxide and boron, in vacuum, {{yields a}} powder containing several samarium boride phases, and their volume ratio {{can be controlled}} through the mixing proportion. The powder can be converted into larger crystals of a certain samarium boride using arc melting or zone melting techniques, relying <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>different</b> melting/crystallization temperature of SmB6 (2580°C), SmB4 (about 2300°C) and SmB66 (2150°C). All these materials are hard, brittle, dark-gray solids with the hardness increasing with the boron content. Samarium diboride is too volatile to be produced with these methods and requires high pressure (about 65 kbar) and low temperatures between 1140 and 1240°C to stabilize its growth. Increasing the temperature results in the preferential formations of SmB6.|$|E
