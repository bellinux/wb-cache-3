5|$|In 2006, the Super 12 {{expanded}} {{to form the}} Super 14 when the Western Force from Perth, Australia, and the Cheetahs from the Free State and Northern Cape Provinces, South Africa joined the competition. An unbeaten run of sixteen matches was nearly halted when the Crusaders drew with the Western Force in Perth in round eleven. The following week, the unbeaten run was ended when the Crusaders lost to the Stormers in Cape Town. That loss was their only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> as they finished top of the table with eleven wins. After beating the Bulls in their semi-final, the Crusaders faced the Hurricanes in the final at Jade Stadium that was played in a thick fog, causing poor visibility. Sections of the crowd {{could not see the}} field, and many spectators left during the match. The scorers were tied 9–9 going into the game's last 20 minutes. The Crusaders' Casey Laulala then scored the game's only try before the match finished 19–12.|$|E

It is the longest stay at the top for a single since R singer Beyoncé's [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] reigned for 10 straight weeks starting in late 2006.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Roos got her own TV show on German television. At the same time, {{she tried to}} start a career in France, where she played the lead role in the musical [...] "Un enfant dans la ville" [...] next to Michel Fugain but only {{had a couple of}} popular hits with 'L'Autoroute', 'L'Amour Toujours', 'Je C'est I, Tu C'Est You', 'L'Amour En Blue Jean' and 'Les Petits Soldats'. In 1972, she entered the German {{national}} final for the Eurovision Song Contest the second time. With her song [...] "Nur die Liebe läßt uns leben" [...] she finished second after the first round of voting only one point behind Cindy & Bert but got the overall victory after the second round of voting. After the reprise of the winning song, she was booed off stage and her victory caused a stir in Germany as she was not the winner of the first round of voting and because of her mediocre vocal performance. In a later interview, she stated that she did not expect to win at all and that she was already removing her make-up when she was called back on stage. However, at the Eurovision Song Contest 1972 in Edinburgh, she finished third. The song was a hit in Germany peaking at #17 in the single charts. Throughout the 1970s she kept releasing singles and albums and was a frequent guest in music shows, although she did not have any more major hits. In 1975, she took part in the German national final again and finished third with [...] "Eine Liebe ist wie ein Lied". Her fourth participation in the national final took place in 1982, where she competed among others against her then husband Werner Böhm. She performed the duet [...] "Lady" [...] with David Hanselmann and finished sixth out of the twelve participants, however, the song was commercially the second most successful <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

60|$|He {{died on the}} {{day before}} Christmas Day, as has been said above, very suddenly, in his bed, early in the morning, in the fifty-third year of his life. To those who saw him about in the world {{there seemed to be no}} reason why he should not {{continue}} his career for the next twenty years. But those who knew him were so well aware of his constant sufferings, that, though they expected no sudden catastrophe, they were hardly surprised when it came. His death was probably caused by those spasms of which he had complained ten years before, in his letter to Mr. Reed. On the last day but <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> a crowd of sorrowing friends stood over his grave as he was laid to rest in Kensal Green; and, as quickly afterwards as it could be executed, a bust to his memory was put up in Westminster Abbey. It is a fine work of art, by Marochetti; but, as a likeness, is, I think, less effective than that which was modelled, and then given to the Garrick Club, by Durham, and has lately been put into marble, and now stands in the upper vestibule of the club. Neither of them, in my opinion, give so accurate an idea of the man as a statuette in bronze, by Boehm, of which two or three copies were made. One of them is in my possession. It has been alleged, in reference to this, that there is something of a caricature in the lengthiness of the figure, in the two hands thrust into the trousers pockets, and in the protrusion of the chin. But this feeling has originated in the general idea that any face, or any figure, not made by the artist more beautiful or more graceful than the original is an injustice. The face must be smoother, the pose of the body must be more dignified, the proportions more perfect, than in the person represented, or satisfaction is not felt. Mr. Boehm has certainly not flattered, but, as far as my eye can judge, he has given the figure of the man exactly as he used to stand before us. I have a portrait of him in crayon, by Samuel Lawrence, as like, but hardly as natural.|$|E
