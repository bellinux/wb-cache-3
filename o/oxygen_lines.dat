5000|$|On 14 June, the {{submarine}} was docked in Pearl Harbor, preparing to take Bhumibol Adulyadej {{and his wife}} Mom Rajawongse Sirikit Kitiyakara, the King and Queen of Thailand on a cruise the next day. Sargo was charging her oxygen tanks when the <b>oxygen</b> <b>line,</b> which entered {{the submarine}} through the stern torpedo room hatch, developed a leak and a fire ignited. Two Mark 37 torpedo warheads detonated [...] "low-order", and the fire spread dramatically, killing the crewman tending the <b>oxygen</b> <b>line,</b> machinists mate third class James E. Smallwood. The fire, fed by the pressurized oxygen, shot flames over 100 feet (30 m) in the air through the hatch. When the combined forces of the shipyard and the boats crew were unable to control the fire, Sargos officers took the submarine {{a short distance from}} the dock and dove with the stern room hatch open. The fire was extinguished, and Sargo bottomed in the channel. A floating crane raised the Sargo, and repairs took three months in drydock.|$|R

50|$|The sodium {{emissions}} {{come from}} a thin sodium layer approximately 10 km thick {{at an altitude of}} 90 - 100 km, above the mesopause and in the D-layer of the ionosphere. The red <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines</b> originate at altitudes of about 300 km, in the F-layer. The green oxygen emissions are more spatially distributed. How sodium gets to mesospheric heights is not yet well understood, but it is believed to be a combination of upward transport of sea salt and meteoritic dust.|$|E
5000|$|Definitions of {{the term}} hypergiant remains vague, and {{although}} luminosity class 0 is for hypergiants, they are more commonly designated by the alternative luminosity classes Ia-0 and Ia+. [...] Their great stellar luminosities are determined from various spectral features, which are sensitive to surface gravity, such as Hβ line widths in hot stars or a strong Balmer discontinuity in cooler stars. Lower surface gravity often indicates larger stars, and hence, higher luminosities. [...] In cooler stars, the width of observed <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines,</b> such as O I at 777.4 nm., {{can be used to}} calibrate directly against stellar luminosity.|$|E
5000|$|Still in 1984, WR 30a was studied spectroscopically and {{assigned}} a WC4 class. [...] Another 1984 study noted dilution of some emission lines, and suggested {{the presence of}} a binary companion of approximate spectral type O4. [...] The WO spectral classification had already been defined, but neither paper considered WR 30a to show sufficiently high excitation lines or strong <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines</b> to merit that classification. A WO spectral class was eventually assigned, with relatively weak O emission but confirmed by the lack of C emission. A WO5 class was temporarily assigned to account for the unusually low excitation, but it was confirmed at WO4 when quantitative criteria for the WO sub-classes were defined.|$|E

5000|$|Supergiants are {{identified}} in the Yerkes spectral classification by luminosities classes Ia and Ib, with intermediates such as Iab and Ia/ab sometimes being used. These luminosity classes are assigned using spectral lines that are sensitive to luminosity. Historically, the Ca H and K line strengths {{have been used for}} yellow stars, as well as the strengths of various metal lines. [...] The neutral <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines,</b> such as the 777.3 nm triplet, have also been used since they are extremely sensitive to luminosity across a wide range of spectral types. [...] Modern atmospheric models can accurately match all the spectral line strengths and profiles to give a spectral classification, or even skip straight to the physical parameters of the star, but in practice luminosity classes are still usually assigned by comparison against standard stars.|$|E

5000|$|Using the {{emergency}} oxygen system, the captain began his emergency descent from FL250 under radar guidance from Hanover {{air traffic control}} (ATC), while the co-pilot depressurised the aircraft and attempted to open a side window to clear the smoke. The cabin crew were deprived of both their public address system and intercom with the flight deck during the descent. Due to lack of time before landing, emergency procedures were abandoned. Following the successful emergency landing, the aircraft came to a rapid halt clear of the runway. By the time {{the last of the}} 89 occupants (five crew and 84 passengers) had evacuated the aircraft, the fire had burned through the pressure hull and was being fed by oxygen. There were no injuries. The fire was extinguished on the ground. Following the incident, the aircraft manufacturer issued several service bulletins (SBs) listing action to be taken as mandated by the UK's Airworthiness Requirements Board (ARB). These SBs were circulated to all One-Eleven operators. The ARB also issued a more general warning to all One-Eleven operators regarding the need to ensure that oxygen leaks do not create fire hazards, and that <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines</b> are routed away from potential fire sources.|$|E

50|$|The {{first pass}} proved fatal for bombardier Sarnoski, who was mortally wounded by a 20mm shell from the fighter at 10:00, which also injured badly injured the navigator, who was {{struck in the}} head, neck, back and side. This same Zero also put at least one 20 mm shell {{in the side of}} the cockpit. It was almost {{certainly}} these hits that delivered a grievous wound to Zeamer's left thigh, sent shrapnel into the assistant flight engineer's legs in the top turret, and struck the <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines</b> behind the cockpit, starting a fire. Almost simultaneously, the Zero at 12:00 put a 20mm shell through the Plexiglass nose that struck Zeamer's rudder pedals, bending them and destroying the instruments on his side of the instrument panel. Zeamer's feet were pulled back under the seat, exposing his calves, which were riddled with shrapnel, and he was also struck in the right wrist, leaving a nasty wound that pulsed blood onto his steering wheel as he continued to pilot the aircraft. Crew accounts conflict, but Zeamer reported seeing Sarnoski, blown from his bombardier's seat with a horrible gash in his side and another in his neck, re-mounting his seat and fending off another fighter approaching from the ten o'clock position, described by crew members as a twin-engine fighter matching the description of a Kawasaki Ki-45 heavy fighter.|$|E
50|$|The {{strength}} and {{profile of the}} lines in the Eta Carinae spectrum are highly variable, {{but there are a}} number of consistent distinctive features. The spectrum is dominated by emission lines, usually broad although the higher excitation lines are overlaid by a narrow central component from dense ionised nebulosity, especially the Weigelt Blobs. Most lines show a P Cygni profile but with the absorption wing much weaker than the emission. The broad P Cygni lines are typical of strong stellar winds, with very weak absorption in this case because the central star is so heavily obscured. Electron scattering wings are present but relatively weak, indicating a clumpy wind. Hydrogen lines are present and strong, showing that Eta Carinae still retains much of its hydrogen envelope. HeI lines are much weaker than the hydrogen lines, and the absence of HeII lines provides an upper limit to the possible temperature of the primary star. NII lines can be identified but are not strong, while carbon lines cannot be detected and <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines</b> are at best very weak, indicating core hydrogen burning via the CNO cycle with some mixing to the surface. Perhaps the most striking feature is the rich FeII emission in both permitted and forbidden lines, with the forbidden lines arising from excitation of low density nebulosity around the star.|$|E
40|$|Accepted for Icarus We {{report on}} the {{detection}} of atomic <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines</b> in the spectra of 8 comets. These forbidden lines {{are a result of}} the photodissociation of the parent oxygen-bearing species directly into an excited state. We used high resolution spectra obtained at the McDonald Observatory 2. 7 m telescope to resolve the cometary <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines</b> from the telluric <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines</b> and from other cometary emissions. We find that the relative intensities of the two red lines (6300. 304 and 6363. 776 ˚A) are consistent with theory. The green line (5577. 339 ˚A) has an intensity which is about 10 % of the sum of the intensities of the two red lines. We show that collisional quenching may be important in the inner coma. If we assume the relative excitation rates of potential parents which have appeared in the literature, then H 2 O would be the parent of the cometary green oxygen line. However, those rates have been questioned. We measured the width of the three <b>oxygen</b> <b>lines</b> and find that the green line is wider than either of the two red lines. The finding of a wider line could imply a different parent for the green and red lines. However, the constancy of the green to red line flux ratio suggests the parent is the same for these lines but that the exciting photons have different energies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSpace weather thermospheric {{monitoring}} requires real-time {{and large-scale}} measurements. In order {{to monitor the}} thermospheric variations due to geomagnetic activity, one relies mostly on the measurements of {{the intensity of the}} atomic <b>oxygen</b> green <b>line</b> and on the indirect measurement of the total electron content. These two parameters do not allow retrieving the full characteristics of the thermosphere, and a third proxy is required, for example, in orbitography. We propose to use the polarization of the atomic <b>oxygen</b> red <b>line</b> to fulfill this requirement. The first measurements of the polarization of thermospheric nightglow lines have been performed {{in the first part of}} the twentieth century and especially during the last International Geophysical Year. Amongst the <b>oxygen</b> visible <b>lines,</b> only the red one seems to be potentially polarized. However, there exists a disagreement between the different measurements. At the origin of the polarization, there is always a dissymmetric mechanism. It triggers either an emission process, a light scattering, or, in the case of the <b>oxygen</b> red <b>line,</b> a collision mechanism. This paper reviews the different experiments performed in the past and proposes to explore this matter with modern facilities. If successful, this investigation could lead to a systematic reanalysis of the previous red line interferometric measurements...|$|R
