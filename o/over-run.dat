5|$|A {{groundbreaking}} {{ceremony for}} the new city hall was held on July 29, 2004, and construction began {{under the direction of}} contractor Lease Crutcher Lewis, who built the original city hall, the following month. During construction, inaccuracies and omissions in the design and problems with demolishing parts of the building led to delays and an <b>over-run</b> of $19.6 million, bringing the final budget to $121 million. The new city hall opened on February 21, 2006, and received praise for its use of wood panels and the concourse's terrazzo flooring. The city hall's lower two floors, including the concourse, service desks, and the city council chamber, are open to the public; the remaining five floors house offices for city services. The city hall was granted an American Institute of Architects Honor Award by the Seattle chapter, as well as an Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star award for energy efficiency. The landscaped plaza was also recognized by the Canadian Society of Landscape Architects with a National Merit Award in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Agnes and Gebhard {{married on}} 2February 1583 in Bonn and retired to the Elector's country seat in Poppelsdorf to {{celebrate}} their nuptials. Within weeks, the Cathedral chapter had deposed Gebhard, electing in his place an old opponent, Ernst of Bavaria, the brother of Wilhelm V, Duke of Bavaria, who immediately set about raising an army {{with the help of}} his brother the duke, and his second brother, Ferdinand of Bavaria. In the spring and summer, Agnes and Gebhard did likewise, traveling to different parts of the electorate, raising an army, and extending the Protestant cause. By October, Ernst's brother Ferdinand entered the electorate from the south, near Koblenz. In their northward progress, they left a path of fire and destruction. Agnes and Gebhard fled, as Poppelsdorf, then Godesberg, and later the capital city of the electorate, Bonn, were <b>over-run</b> and destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Nobunaga granted Echizen to {{his general}} Shibata Katsuie, and in 1576 Katsuie's nephew Sakuma Morimasa {{penetrated}} deeper into Kaga, capturing Miyukizuka. In 1580, Morimasa destroyed the capital, Oyama Gobo. The same year, Ishiyama Hongan-ji surrendered. Despite {{the resistance of}} the Ikkō-Ikki being effectively suppressed, a few Kaga ikki fled the plains and entrenched themselves in the mountains at the fortified temples Torigoe and Futoge. Shibata Katsuie captured these strongholds in 1581, but the garrisons he established were <b>over-run</b> and the temples recaptured. Still in the year 1581, Katsuie and Sakuma Morimasa again recaptured the temples, killing all the Ikkō-ikki at the sites. Despite this, in 1582, resistance elements again recaptured Torigoe and Futoge. A third attack was mounted by Morimasa, and this time the final resistance elements were eliminated, ending the last vestiges of ikki rule in Kaga.|$|E

5|$|The railway opened {{short of}} rolling stock as {{only half of}} the twelve {{locomotives}} and twenty-four of forty passenger carriages ordered had arrived. The carriage builders, Brown, Marshall & Co of Birmingham, stated that based on their experience they had expected the line to open at least two months late. The third day after opening to passengers, on 23 September, there was a collision between two trains at Kittybrewster that resulted in the death of a passenger and several serious injuries. The inquiry found that the driver, attempting to make up time after a late start, had <b>over-run</b> previous stations and been approaching the terminus with excessive speed. The driver attempted to select reverse gear to slow the train but had failed {{to hold on to the}} lever, which slipped into forward, propelling the train into carriages waiting at the platform. The report also criticised the station staff, who should not have allowed the carriages to be waiting at the station. The layout at Kittybrewster was altered after the accident.|$|E
5|$|When the Royal Scots {{had entered}} the eastern section of the El Arish Redoubt during {{the second phase of}} the attack, the western half was still held by Ottoman defenders. These defences became the {{objectives}} of the attacks by the 161st and 163rd Brigades of the 54th (East Anglian) Division, supported by four tanksincluding the two which had passed through the El Arish redoubt. On the right of the 163rd Brigade's advance, the 1/5th Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment moved towards the Ottoman trenches following a creeping barrage to attack and <b>over–run</b> the western El Arish trenches during hand–to–hand fighting when the 1/5th Battalion, The Suffolk Regiment suffered light casualties. Although they had captured the third line, part of this captured territory had to be abandoned because it was exposed to hostile fire, so they consolidated their position along the second line. Half of the 1/8th Battalion, Hampshire Regiment attacked Burj Trench while the other half attacked Triangle Trench, although it was not their objective. This caused some confusion, and the 1/4th and 1/5th Battalions, The Norfolk Regiment lost direction in the dust and smoke of the cloudy, hazy night. As a result, only small numbers reached Gibraltar and Crested Rock, from where they were quickly forced to withdraw.|$|E
25|$|As {{the overall}} or {{external}} {{size of a}} roundabout (in the UK {{referred to as the}} Inscribed Circle Diameter – ICD) is reduced, so the maximum practicable (and prescribed) diameter for the central island is also reduced, whilst the width of the circulatory carriageway increases (due to the greater width of vehicle swept path at smaller turning radii). In most cases this results in it being too easy – certainly when traffic is light relative to capacity – for drivers to traverse the roundabout at relatively high speed, with scant regard for road markings or the potential dangers to self or conflicts with other road users. To mitigate this risk, a proportion of the circulatory carriageway – an annulus around the central island – is segregated from general use by demarcation lines and differentiated from the outer annulus of carriageway by a combination of slightly raised surface, adverse crossfall, contrasting colours and textures and demarcating lines. The effect of this is to discourage drivers from taking a more direct path through the roundabout, their line of least resistance being more tightly curved (and therefore slower) but more bearable. The inner annulus provides for the trailing axles of longer or articulated vehicles to sweep across the inner annulus, which is therefore known as an <b>over-run</b> area (in UK usage), truck apron, or mountable apron.|$|E

500|$|The New Guinea Air Warning Wireless, {{also known}} as the [...] "New Guinea Air Warning Wireless Company", [...] "NGAWW", or [...] "The Spotters", was a unique signals unit of the Australian Army formed in January 1942 in Port Moresby, Territory of Papua, during World War II, to provide early warning of Japanese air attack, and {{subsequently}} providing surveillance of shipping and ground based troops. During the first month of operations 16 stations were established, with positions set up along the Papuan coast {{as well as in the}} mountains near Port Moresby. They often operated behind Japanese lines and were at risk of being captured by the Japanese due to the nature of their operations, while a number of outstations were <b>over-run</b> and the men manning them killed. By the end of 1942 the company was maintaining 61 operational stations and had a strength of 180 men.|$|E
500|$|Personnel {{from the}} company were often {{at risk of being}} {{captured}} by the Japanese {{due to the nature of}} their operations, while a number of outstations were <b>over-run</b> and the men manning them killed. Indeed, the landing of Japanese forces on Papua in 1942 had required a shift from providing air raid warnings to furnishing military intelligence. As a result, many stations found themselves isolated behind Japanese lines, relying on the support of the native population whilst evading capture in order to continue operating. Later, as the tide of war turned in the Allies' favour, it became necessary for the spotters to move ahead of the advancing Allied forces and also compelled the spotters to work in close proximity to Japanese forces. In 1944, a team operated a station on Lake Rombebai, [...] in advance of the nearest Allied forces. Between them the spotters rescued or buried more than 200 crashed American and Australian airmen, caring for the injured and arranging safe transport for others.|$|E
500|$|Sir John Louis was {{appointed}} captain in October 1811 and took Aigle to the Mediterranean. Aigle and [...] used boats to land marines and seamen near the harbour of Campo del Porto, Elba, on 20 June 1813. When the batteries protecting the town were <b>over-run</b> and the troops there routed, the French scuttled {{three of their}} own ships {{to prevent them from}} becoming prizes. The following morning, having returned to the boats, the marines captured a small convoy of three settees and drove the brig protecting them into Portoferraio. Two large feluccas were taken from the town of Mesca in the Gulf of Spezia, on the 28 June. Prevented by the wind from using the ships, the British once more took to boats but only succeeded in driving their quarry inshore. Later that evening the wind changed direction and Aigle and Curacoa were able to bombard the town while marines took the feluccas from the beach.|$|E
40|$|When complex {{projects}} {{result in}} large-cost <b>over-runs,</b> managers {{want to understand}} why this happened. There may be the possibility of making a claim against another party, or managers may simply wish to learn from any mistakes made. When using system dynamics (SD) models to analyse the reasons for project <b>over-runs</b> {{as a part of}} a litigation or organizational learning process, there is a strong focus on explaining historical aspects precisely. This leads to a need for the inclusion of discontinuous variables. This paper discusses the nature of discontinuities in SD models of project <b>over-runs.</b> Examples are given to demonstrate that the modelling of such discontinuities needs to be an integral part of the continuous simulation modelling process. Their inclusion helps to improve model validity and also, by forcing validity, uncover the important drivers of project behaviour. The examples given in this paper are significant drivers and suggest important learning about the behaviour of disrupted complex projects...|$|R

2500|$|On 24 December, the 2/10th Battalion {{with the}} I/126th Battalion were to attack up the Old Strip. Despite the four tanks {{allocated}} {{to support the}} attack being destroyed by a concealed anti-aircraft gun at the outset, the right flank was able to advance about , having approached {{the fringe of the}} coconut plantation that extended around the coast from the western end of the Old Strip. The I/128th Battalion had also joined the fighting along the Old Strip that day. The Australians were being employed as [...] "shock troops" [...] and relied on the Americans to clear behind them as they advanced. The III/128th Battalion had similarly supported the 2/9th Battalion. On 25 December, an advance by infiltration was attempted but two anti-aircraft guns and their supporting defences were encountered. On 26 December, the first fell silent, out of ammunition and was <b>over-run</b> by the Americans. The second gun and supporting positions only fell after a bitter struggle. The impetus for the advance that day had been held by strongly contested positions which ultimately yielded to the tenacity of the attackers, who suffered heavily without the benefit of supporting tanks. On 27 December the attackers consolidated the position {{at the end of the}} Old Strip. By 28 December, most of the Japanese were contained in the coastal strip of coconut plantation from the Simemi Creek at the end of the Old Strip to Giropa Creek, about half a mile from the coast. [...] A plan for 28 December to squeeze the Japanese with a pivot from each flank was a costly failure and during the evening, the right flank was counter-attacked with many casualties, while the Japanese raided American positions in depth. An attack was planned for 29 December, with newly arrived tanks. The 2/10th Battalion was strengthened by a company of the 2/9th Battalion but the attack became a fiasco, when the tanks attacked their own troops.|$|E
