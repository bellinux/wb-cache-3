5|$|However, {{languages}} {{differ from}} biological organisms {{in that they}} readily incorporate elements from other languages {{through the process of}} diffusion, as speakers of different languages come into contact. Humans also frequently speak more than one language, acquiring their first language or languages as children, <b>or</b> <b>learning</b> new languages as they grow up. Because of the increased language contact in the globalizing world, many small languages are becoming endangered as their speakers shift to other languages that afford the possibility to participate in larger and more influential speech communities.|$|E
5|$|Hubert Walter (– 13 July 1205) was an {{influential}} royal adviser {{in the late}} twelfth and early thirteenth centuries in the positions of Chief Justiciar of England, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Lord Chancellor. As chancellor, Walter began the keeping of the Charter Roll, a record of all charters issued by the chancery. Walter was not noted for his holiness in life <b>or</b> <b>learning,</b> but historians have judged {{him one of the}} most outstanding government ministers in English history.|$|E

5|$|Altrincham now has {{eighteen}} primary schools, {{one special}} school and eight secondary schools, including five grammar schools; the Trafford district maintains a selective education system {{assessed by the}} 11-plus exam. Several of Altrincham's secondary schools have specialist status: Altrincham College of Arts (arts); Altrincham Grammar School for Boys (language); Altrincham Grammar School for Girls (language); Blessed Thomas Holford Catholic College (maths and computing); Loreto Grammar School (science and maths); and St. Ambrose College (maths and computing). Altrincham College of Arts, Altrincham Grammar School for Boys, Altrincham Grammar School for Girls, Blessed Thomas Holford Catholic College, Loreto Grammar School, and St. Ambrose College were all rated as outstanding in their most recent Ofsted reports.

5|$|In 1879, Ulysses S. Grant, {{the former}} President of the United States, visited Japan. While in Tokyo, he {{attended}} a jujutsu presentation at Shibusawa Eiichi's home in Asukayama. Kano Jigoro {{was one of the}} jujutsuka present. At that time, jujutsu was just starting to become known in Europe and the Americas. Excepting literal circus acts, few non-Japanese had much chance of seeing <b>or</b> <b>learning</b> about the art. Even in Japan, judo and jujutsu were not considered separate disciplines at that time. Indeed, it was not until 1925 that there started to be clear differentiation of the names in Japan, and outside Japan, judo and jujutsu were not completely separated until the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|On Jan. 11, 2016, the Klein ISD Board of Trustees {{approved}} the Design Development for Intermediate School #10. Huckabee Architects has designed the 205,000 sf. campus in three separate learning areas: 6th Grade, 7th & 8th Grade STEM, and 7th & 8th Grade Humanities. It {{is designed to}} accommodate a site on West Rayford Rd next to Metzler Elementary with a 20ft. elevation change that runs front to back, as well as 2 acres of protected wetlands. Per the current instructional program for intermediate schools, the campus includes a Black Box theater classroom that is being designed to combine as a stage, collaboration areas within the communities for project-based learning and small group instruction, and Makerspace in the library <b>or</b> <b>learning</b> commons. The estimated completion date is Fall 2018.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} Pokémon {{are capable of}} {{evolving}} into a larger and more powerful creature. The change is accompanied by stat changes, generally a modest increase, and access to {{a wider variety of}} attacks. There are multiple ways to trigger an evolution including reaching a particular level, using a special stone, <b>or</b> <b>learning</b> a specific attack. For example, at level 16 Bulbasaur is capable of evolving into Ivysaur. Most notably, the Normal-type Eevee is capable of evolving into eight different Pokémon: Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire), Vaporeon (Water), Umbreon (Dark), Espeon (Psychic), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice), and Sylveon (Fairy). In Generation VI, a new mechanic called Mega Evolution—as well as a subset of Mega Evolution called Primal Reversion—was introduced into the game. Unlike normal evolution, Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion last only for the duration of a battle, with the Pokémon reverting to its normal form at the end. Forty-eight Pokémon are capable of undergoing Mega Evolution or Primal Reversion as of the release of Sun and Moon. In contrast, some species such as Castform, Rotom, Unown, and Lycanroc undergo form changes that may provide stat buffs or changes and type alterations but are not considered new species.|$|E
5|$|The programmers {{suggested}} using 3D Studio Max for art {{and level}} design, which would {{save money by}} allowing the company to license {{a single piece of}} software, but the lead artists successfully lobbied against this plan, believing that allowing the respective teams to choose the software would allow them to work most efficiently. Huebner said this saved the project more time than any other decision made during development. The level designers chose QERadiant to take advantage of their previous experience using the software while working on Id Software's Quake series. Id allowed Nihilistic to license QERadiant and modify it to create a customized tool for its 3D environments. Because QERadiant was a finished, functional tool, it allowed the level designers to begin developing levels from the project's start and then export them into the NOD engine, rather than waiting for up to six months for Nihilistic to develop a custom tool <b>or</b> <b>learning</b> a new 3D level editor. In twenty-four months, the three level designers built over 100 in-game environments for Redemption. They obtained blueprints and sketches of buildings from medieval Prague and Vienna to better represent that period and locations. The four-person art team led by Kraaijvanger used Alias Wavefront Maya to create 3D art. Nihilistic's management wanted Kraaijvanger to use a less expensive tool but relented when the cost was found to be lower than had been thought. Throughout the project, the art team built over 1,500 3D models.|$|E
