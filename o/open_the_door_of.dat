25|$|As per the {{instructions}} in Akilam, the Swamithope pathi conducts daily festival (i.e.) every day is considered as a festival day. So the ritual practices conducted during festival days are conducted here throughout the year, though not in a grand scale as during the other festivals. The daily Panividai starts {{very early in the}} morning. Everyday, around 3:00 A.M the Payyans and the people staying at the temple go to Muthirikkinaru and take a holy bath. Then, they return to the Pathi and start the panividai. The Payyan chant Ukappatippu, and the devotees repeat it. Then, they <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> sanctum sanctorum. It is considered sanctifying to witness this scene with the sounding of a dozen temple bells and conch. Then, there is the Vahana pavani.|$|E

2500|$|Poirot's {{explanation}} {{solves the}} case to the satisfaction of Carla and, most importantly, her fiancé. But, as Elsa forces him to admit, it cannot be proven. Poirot states that, although his chances of getting a conviction are slim, he does not intend to simply leave her to her rich, privileged life. Privately, however, she confides the full measure of her defeat. Caroline, having earned redemption, went uncomplainingly to prison, where she died soon after. Elsa has always felt that the husband and wife escaped together, and her own life has been empty since. The last paragraph of the novel underlines this defeat: [...] "The chauffeur held <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> the car. Lady Dittisham got in and the chauffeur wrapped the fur rug around her knees." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{announcement}} of a new purported clean source of energy came at a crucial time: adults still remembered the 1973 oil crisis and the problems caused by oil dependence, anthropogenic global warming was starting to become notorious, the anti-nuclear movement was labeling nuclear power plants as dangerous and getting them closed, people had in mind the consequences of strip mining, acid rain, the greenhouse effect and the Exxon Valdez oil spill, which happened {{the day after the}} announcement. In the press conference, Chase N. Peterson, Fleischmann and Pons, backed by the solidity of their scientific credentials, repeatedly assured the journalists that cold fusion would solve environmental problems, and would provide a limitless inexhaustible source of clean energy, using only seawater as fuel. They said the results had been confirmed dozens of times and they had no doubts about them. In the accompanying press release Fleischmann was quoted saying: [...] "What we have done is to <b>open</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>of</b> a new research area, our indications are that the discovery will be relatively easy to make into a usable technology for generating heat and power, but continued work is needed, first, to further understand the science and secondly, to determine its value to energy economics." ...|$|E
