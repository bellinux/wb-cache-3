40|$|Abstract. In this paper, when Reynolds {{number is}} {{within the range of}} 10000 to 1000000, the {{horizontal}} component of the total pressure of flow around flat plate at high angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> was regarded as lift of high angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> and the vertical component was regarded as drag of high angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> The horizontal component of total pressure at small angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> was regarded as shape drag, and the total drag coefficient at small angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> was considered to the sum of the shape drag and frictional drag at zero angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> For the two states of large and small angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> the application scopes of the formulas of lift and drag coefficients were given. Final, the relations of lift and drag coefficients were obtained by eliminating all angles <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> Research results show that lift- drag curve of small angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is parabola, and the lift- drag curve of high angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is circle...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the angle}} <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> {{is less than}} the {{stalling}} angle any increase in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> causes an increase in lift coefficient that causes the wing to rise. As the wing rises the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> and lift coefficient decrease which tend to restore the wing to its original angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> Conversely any decrease in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> causes a decrease in lift coefficient which causes the wing to descend. As the wing descends, the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> and lift coefficient increase which tends to restore the wing to its original angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> For this reason the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is stable when it {{is less than the}} stalling angle. [...] The aircraft displays damping in roll.|$|R

5|$|Because Guianan {{cocks-of-the-rock}} form large leks, averaging 55 adult males, {{the males}} in these display leks were {{especially vulnerable to}} attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators. In manipulated groups of smaller size, around 6, predation was less likely to occur, giving rise to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency <b>of</b> <b>attacks</b> {{and the size of}} leks. Thus, with a smaller frequency <b>of</b> <b>attacks</b> on the smaller group, the Guianan cock-of-the-rock males was less likely to spook or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush out 90% of the time. It was found that these birds have relatively ineffective methods of anti-predation and that only social anti-predation and the infrequency of encounters with predators were keeping these lekking males alive.|$|E
5|$|Between 15 September and 10 October, Hindu nationalists {{directed}} a wave <b>of</b> <b>attacks</b> targetting Christian communities in Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, New Delhi, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand, and Muslim communities in Gujarat and Maharashtra.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fifth}} wave <b>of</b> <b>attacks,</b> two Pakistani {{soldiers}} closed on Singh's position; Singh {{jumped out of}} his trench and killed them with his bayonet, greatly demoralizing the Pakistanis. Singh and his men then successfully repelled three more enemy attacks before the Pakistani troops finally retreated, unable to capture their position.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the wing}} is stalled and the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> {{is greater than}} the {{stalling}} angle any increase in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> causes a decrease in lift coefficient that causes the wing to descend. As the wing descends the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases, which causes the lift coefficient to decrease and the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> to increase. Conversely any decrease in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> causes an increase in lift coefficient that causes the wing to rise. As the wing rises the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> decreases and causes the lift coefficient to increase further towards the maximum lift coefficient. For this reason the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is unstable when it {{is greater than the}} stalling angle. Any disturbance of the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> on one wing will cause the whole wing to roll spontaneously and continuously.|$|R
50|$|In aerodynamics, {{hysteresis}} can {{be observed}} when decreasing the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> a wing after stall, regarding the lift and drag coefficients. The angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> where the flow {{on top of the}} wing reattaches is generally lower than the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> where the flow separates during the increase of the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{critical}} angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> which produces maximum lift coefficient. This is {{also called the}} [...] "stall angle of attack". Below the {{critical angle}} <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> as the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases, the coefficient of lift (Cl) increases. Conversely, above the critical angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> as angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases, the air begins to flow less smoothly over the upper surface of the airfoil and begins to separate from the upper surface. On most airfoil shapes, as the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases, the upper surface separation point of the flow moves from the trailing edge towards the leading edge. At the critical angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> upper surface flow is more separated and the airfoil or wing is producing its maximum coefficient of lift. As angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases further, the upper surface flow {{becomes more and more}} fully separated and the airfoil/wing produces less coefficient of lift.|$|R

5|$|From November 1943, {{during the}} seven-week Battle of Changde, the Chinese forced Japan {{to fight a}} costly war of attrition, while {{awaiting}} Allied relief. In January 1944, the Allies launched a series <b>of</b> <b>attacks</b> in Italy against the line at Monte Cassino and tried to outflank it with landings at Anzio. By the end of January, a major Soviet offensive expelled German forces from the Leningrad region, ending the longest and most lethal siege in history.|$|E
5|$|In 1670, Charles II {{incorporated}} by royal charter the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), granting it {{a monopoly on}} the fur trade in the area known as Rupert's Land, which would later form {{a large proportion of}} the Dominion of Canada.

50|$|If an {{aircraft}} is longitudinally stable, a small increase in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> {{will cause the}} pitching moment on the aircraft to change so that the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> decreases. Similarly, a small decrease in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> will cause the pitching moment to change so that the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases.|$|R
40|$|The effects <b>of</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> between 0 and 4 degrees were studied. The results {{indicate}} that increasing angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> from zero can produce substantial changes in the transonic flutter characteristics that are favorable or unfavorable depending on Mach number and angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> The bottom <b>of</b> the transonic flutter-boundary 'bucket' is shown to occur at lower Mach number as angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases. These flutter results correlate well {{with the effects of}} Mach number and angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> on aerodynamic behavior, especially on the development of transonic flow phenomena. The calculated flutter characteristics are in good agreement with the experimental data at zero angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> but at nonzero angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> the experiments show sharply declining and backward-turning transonic flutter boundaries that are not indicated by the calculations. These may be caused by variations in static aeroelastic deformation...|$|R
50|$|Flow {{separation}} {{begins to}} occur at small angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> while attached flow over the wing is still dominant. As angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> increases, the separated regions {{on the top}} of the wing increase in size and hinder the wing's ability to create lift. At the critical angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> separated flow is so dominant that additional increases in angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> produce less lift and more drag.|$|R

5|$|In {{the second}} phase <b>of</b> <b>attacks,</b> shipping, coastal airfields, radar and {{stations}} south of London were attacked during 8–18 August. The Luftwaffe gradually increased the frequency <b>of</b> <b>attacks.</b> German bombers also raided targets {{as far north as}} Liverpool during night hours. The first major raid inland and against RAF airfields came on 12 August. RAF Hawkinge, Lympne, Manston and radar stations at Pevensey, Rye and Dover were to be destroyed. Portsmouth docks were also targeted. The results of the raids were mixed. The Radar station at Ventnor was badly damaged and others targeted were also damaged, but not destroyed. All were in working order by the following morning. The attacks against the harbour and RAF stations had failed to destroy them. All were not in fully working order {{by the end of the}} day, but were back in action the following morning. Unknown to German intelligence, Lympne itself was not even an operational station. This sort of intelligence blunder contributed to the failure of Adlertag.|$|E
50|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{are equipped with}} a built-in flight computer that automatically prevents the aircraft from increasing the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> any further when a maximum angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is reached, regardless of pilot input. This is called the 'angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> limiter' or 'alpha limiter'. Modern airliners that have fly-by-wire technology avoid the critical angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> by means <b>of</b> software in the computer systems that govern the flight control surfaces.|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{investigation into}} the flow correction for an angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> sensor mounted ahead of the wing tip of a general aviation research airplane has been conducted at the Langley Research Center.

The results show the correction is significant, reaching 10 deg at a measured angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> about 90 deg. The flow correction was sensitive to the angle of sideslip at measured angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> greater than 60 deg and was not influenced by wing leading-edge modifications or aileron deflections...|$|R

30|$|The {{results showed}} that when α <  0 °, the {{increase}} of the absolute angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> value decreased water-entry depth, horizontal displacement, and slope angle.

When α ≥  0 °, the decrease of initial angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> value decreased water-entry depth and horizontal displacement and accelerated the decrease of slope angle. It accelerated the increase of positive rotational angular velocity and positive angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> The vehicle rotated downwards and even overturned. The decrease of initial water-entry angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> reduced the change of slope angle and angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> during water entry.

40|$|AbstractA formal {{analysis}} to footprint problem with effects <b>of</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> (AOA) is presented. First a flexible and rapid standardized method for footprint generation is developed. Zero bank angle control strategy and the maximum crossrange method {{are used to}} obtain virtual target set; afterward, closed-loop bank angle guidance law is used to find footprint by solving closest approach problem for each element in virtual target set. Then based on quasi-equilibrium glide condition, the typical inequality reentry trajectory constraints are converted to angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> lower boundary constraint. Constrained by the lower boundary, an original and practical angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> parametric method is proposed. By using parametric angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> profile, optimization algorithm for angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is designed and the impact <b>of</b> angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> to footprint is discussed. Simulations with different angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> profiles are presented to demonstrate {{the performance of the}} proposed footprint solution method and validity of optimal algorithm...|$|R
40|$|In-flight {{pressure}} distributions at four fuselage stations on the forebody of the X- 29 A aircraft {{have been}} reported at angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> from 15 to 66 deg and at Mach numbers from 0. 22 to 0. 60. At angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 20 deg and higher, vortices shed from the nose strake caused suction peaks in the pressure distributions that generally increased in magnitude with angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> Above 30 deg-angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> the forebody pressure distributions became asymmetrical at the most forward station, while they remained nearly symmetrical until 50 to 55 deg-angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> for the aft stations. Between 59 to 66 deg-angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> the asymmetry <b>of</b> the pressure distributions changed direction. Yawing moments for the forebody alone were obtained by integrating the forebody pressure distributions. At 45 deg-angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> the aircraft yaws {{to the right and}} at 50 deg and higher, the aircraft yaws to the left. The forebody yawing moments correlated well with the aircraft left yawing moment at an angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 50 deg or higher. At a 45 deg-angle <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> the forebody yawing moments did not correlate well with the aircraft yawing moment, but it is suggested that this was due to asymmetric pressures on the cockpit region of the fuselage which was not instrumented. The forebody was also shown to provide a positive component of directional stability of the aircraft at angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 25 deg or higher. A Mach number effect was noted at angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> 30 deg or higher at the station where the nose strake was present. At this station, the suction peaks in the pressure distributions at the highest Mach number were reduced and much more symmetrical as compared to the lower Mach number pressure distributions...|$|R

5|$|Several of Necrid's attacks {{duplicate}} physical {{motions and}} properties <b>of</b> <b>attacks</b> used by other {{characters in the}} series. However, each attack causes his weapon to extend from then retract into his hands, resulting in different visual cues than the move they derive from. Some attacks combine elements of two other existing character moves; for example, Dragon Blaze begins with one attack used by Maxi and ends with another from Nightmare. Despite this fact some moves are unique to Necrid's repertoire, such as Elder Topaz, an attack stance that allows {{the use of an}} altered set <b>of</b> <b>attacks</b> for a short time, and Void Cannon, which creates a small explosion on the ground at varying distances from Necrid.|$|E
5|$|Targeting bore little {{resemblance}} to reality in that the sequence <b>of</b> <b>attacks</b> was uncoordinated and the targets were approved randomly – even illogically.

50|$|The angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> is {{the angle}} between the chord line of an airfoil and the {{oncoming}} air.

For small angles a symmetrical airfoil will generate a lift force roughly proportional to the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{has been made}} in the Langley free-flight tunnel at low-subsonic speed to determine the static stability, control effectiveness, and damping in roll and yaw of a model with a low-aspect-ratio unswept wing and two different fuselage forebodies at angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> from 0 deg to 90 deg. Results were obtained with a fuselage configuration having a long pointed nose and a shorter rounded nose. Although the wing stalled at an angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> about 12 deg, maximum lift did not occur until an angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> about 40 deg or 50 deg was obtained. The static longitudinal stability of the model having a short rounded nose was greater than that of the model having a longer pointed nose over the entire angle-of-attack range. The pointed-nose model had large out-of-trim yawing moments above an angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> about 40 deg. Shortening and rounding the nose of the model delayed these out-of-trim yawing moments to slightly higher angles <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> Both models were directionally unstable above an angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> <b>of</b> about 20 deg, but both had positive effective dihedral over virtually the entire angle-of-attack range. At the higher angles <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> the pointed-nose model had generally better damping in roll than that of the rounded-nose model.

50|$|As {{the angle}} <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> grows larger, the lift {{reaches a maximum}} at some angle; {{increasing}} the angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> beyond this critical angle <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> causes the upper-surface flow to separate from the wing; there is less deflection downward so the airfoil generates less lift.
