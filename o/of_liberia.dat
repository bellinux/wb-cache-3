5|$|From 1945 to 1964, the {{officers}} appointed were nearly all college graduates. From 1951, {{there was a}} US military mission based in Liberia to assist in training the AFL. A Reserve Officers' Training Corps was established in 1956 with units at the University <b>of</b> <b>Liberia</b> in Monrovia and the Booker Washington Institute in Kakata. By 1978 the program had been redesignated the Army Student Training Program (ASTP) and had a total of 46 students at the University <b>of</b> <b>Liberia,</b> the Booker Washington Institute, and three smaller institutions.

5|$|The Armed Forces <b>of</b> <b>Liberia</b> (AFL) are {{the armed}} forces of the Republic <b>of</b> <b>Liberia.</b> Tracing its origins to a militia that was formed by the first black colonists in what is now Liberia, it was founded as the Liberian Frontier Force in 1908, and retitled in 1956. For {{virtually}} all of its history, the AFL has received considerable materiel and training assistance from the United States. For most of the 1941–89 period, training was largely provided by U.S. advisers, though this assistance has not prevented the same generally low levels of effectiveness common to most of {{the armed forces}} in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|With {{a view to}} {{enhancing}} educational {{developments in}} Liberia, in late 1963 and early 1964, Massaquoi spent six months in the United States on an education scholarship, visiting fine arts colleges and university departments of anthropology and sociology, mainly {{in the east and}} mid-west. In 1968, while living in Monrovia, Liberia, with her daughter Vivian Seton and her grandchildren, Massaquoi suffered a stroke. This pressed Seton into having the 700 pages of her mother's unpublished autobiography microfilmed, calling on the assistance of colleagues at the University <b>of</b> <b>Liberia.</b> Massaquoi retired from the university in the summer of 1972, receiving an honorary Doctor of Humanities degree. She was also decorated as a Grand Commander of the Grand Star of Africa by the president <b>of</b> <b>Liberia.</b>|$|E

However, on the government side the AFL played only a minor role; irregular ex National Patriotic Front <b>of</b> <b>Liberia</b> militias backed by more privileged Taylor partisans such as the Anti-Terrorist Unit saw most of the fighting.|$|E

5|$|Upon the {{invitation}} of President William Tubman, Massaquoi returned to Liberia on 13 October 1946 to help him establish a university in Monrovia. She became Professor of French and Science in March 1947 at Liberia College, later the University <b>of</b> <b>Liberia</b> (UL). In 1956, she became director, then dean (1960), of the Liberal Arts College and was a co-founder of the Society of Liberian Authors. In 1962 Massaquoi founded and directed a programme for African Studies, which would evolve into the Institute of African Studies at UL.|$|E
5|$|During her term at the university, Massaquoi {{succeeded in}} {{overcoming}} {{the requirement that}} students should adopt foreign names rather than keeping those of their indigenous families. In connection with this, when she married Ernest Freeman on 26 July 1948, Massaquoi adopted his tribal name Fahnbulleh, calling herself Fatima Massaquoi-Fahnbulleh. Her husband also changed his own name back to Fahnbulleh. To further contribute to the cultural and social development <b>of</b> <b>Liberia,</b> she organized a seminar through the African Studies Program in 1962 to promote the standardization of the Vai script.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{induction}} of Taylor as elected president <b>of</b> <b>Liberia</b> in August 1997, the Ministry of National Defense {{determined that the}} strength of the AFL had risen during the war from 6,500 to 14,981 service members. To begin demobilization, the AFL Chief of Staff published Special Orders No. 1 on January 1, 1998, demobilizing and retiring 2,250 personnel. The demobilization process was delayed and badly managed, and only on April 22, 1998 did payments began to be issued to the demobilizing personnel, without prior explanation of what exactly the payments represented.|$|E
5|$|The LFF {{was renamed}} as the Armed Forces <b>of</b> <b>Liberia</b> under the Amended National Defense Law of 1956, though other sources say 1962, {{which appears to}} have been the date the land force became the Liberian National Guard. From this period, Liberia's armed forces {{consisted}} of the Liberian National Guard, the Liberian Militia, whose ostensible structure is depicted below, and the Liberian Coast Guard. Until 1980, by law every able-bodied male between the ages of 16 and 45 years was to serve in the militia, though this stipulation was not enforced.|$|E
5|$|The Liberian open registry, {{founded in}} 1948, was {{the brainchild of}} Edward Stettinius, who had been Franklin D. Roosevelt's Secretary of State during World War II. Stettinius created a {{corporate}} structure that included The Liberia Corporation, a joint-venture with the government <b>of</b> <b>Liberia.</b> The corporation was structured so that one-fourth of its revenue would go to the Liberian government, another 10% went to fund social programs in Liberia, and the remainder returned to Stettinius' corporation. The Liberian registry was created at a time when Panama's registry was becoming less attractive for several reasons including its unpopularity with the U.S. labor movement and European shipping concerns, political unrest in Panama, and increases in its fees and regulations.|$|E
