5|$|Albertson {{returned}} {{in a later}} episode that features Dr. Campanelli participating in a documentary film about hospital surgery. Unfortunately, Campanelli develops stage fright during filming. Noland then takes over the operation and receives all the acclaim. Kopell returned to {{his role as a}} hospital orderly in two episodes, <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> causes a furor with a hospital scandal sheet, the other showing Noland having to save him from being fleeced by a patient who is also a card shark.|$|E
5|$|In 1972, Applewhite met Bonnie Nettles, a nurse with an {{interest}} in theosophy and Biblical prophecy. The two quickly became close friends; he later recalled that he felt like he had known her {{for a long time and}} concluded that they had met in a past life. She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by extraterrestrials, persuading him that he had a divine assignment. By that time, he had begun to investigate alternatives to traditional Christian doctrine, including astrology. He also had had several visions, including <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> was told that he was chosen for a role like that of Jesus. In her 2005 profile of Applewhite, Susan Raine speculates that he had a schizophrenic episode around this time.|$|E
5|$|Usain Bolt also {{competed in}} the men's 200meters race. Although he participated in the men's 100meters and the men's 4 × 100meters relay in {{addition}} to the 200meters, this race was the only <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> had competed at the Olympics for the second time (he previously raced in the 200meters in Athens). During the August 17 qualification round, Bolt {{competed in the}} fifth heat. He ran the race in 20.64seconds, placing second out of the nine athletes in his heat.

Out of 62 finishing athletes, Bolt tied Poland's Marcin Jedrusinski for 17th place. He advanced to the next round.|$|E

25|$|He joined Buckinghamshire for the 1914 Minor Counties Championship, {{making his}} debut against Wiltshire. This {{was to be}} the start of a {{prolific}} career for Buckinghamshire in Minor counties cricket, <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> represented the county until 1946, with only World War I and World War II truncating his playing career. Edwards made 165 appearances for Buckinghamshire in the Minor Counties Championship. He finished his career with the county having taken 1,082 wickets at an impressive average of 10.91 runs.

60|$|That is not faith, to see God only in what {{is strange}} and rare; but this is faith, to see God {{in what is}} most common and simple, to know God's greatness not so much from {{disorder}} as from order, not so much from those strange sights <b>in</b> <b>which</b> God seems (but only seems) to break His laws, as from those common <b>ones</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>He</b> fulfils His laws.|$|R

25|$|Ron MacLean - {{the host}} of Hockey Night in Canada has {{appeared}} on Air Farce in several sketches, most notably <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> portrays himself alongside Goy (as the Queen who is impersonating Don Cherry).

Later in the sketch, Schwartz and MacLean (both guest stars portraying themselves), switch seats, and the passenger mistakes MacLean for Schwartz. Another memorable sketch had MacLean impersonate Cherry while Ferguson {{played the role of}} MacLean. MacLean also appeared for a video message to the show's live 300th episode. He also appeared in the final program of the series to fire the Chicken Cannon.|$|E
25|$|Eugene's {{main reason}} for {{desiring}} peace in the west was the growing danger posed by the Turks in the east. Turkish military ambitions had revived after 1711 when they had mauled Peter the Great's army on the river Pruth: in December 1714 Sultan Ahmed III's forces attacked the Venetians in the Morea. To Vienna {{it was clear that}} the Turks intended to attack Hungary and undo the whole Karlowitz settlement of 1699. After the Porte rejected an offer of mediation in April 1716, Charles VI despatched Eugene to Hungary to lead his relatively small but professional army. Of all Eugene's wars this was the <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> exercised most direct control; it was also a war which, for the most part, Austria fought and won on her own.|$|E
25|$|Whitehead's {{earliest}} known appearances were in two 1785 matches when {{he played}} for the Gentlemen of Kent against White Conduit Club. His first-class debut was on Monday, 20 June 1785 at Sevenoaks Vine. He scored 1 and 22 to help his team win by 104 runs. In the return match played 30 June – 1 July at White Conduit Fields, the Gentlemen of Kent were heavily defeated by 304 runs, Whitehead scoring only 2 and 4. He did, however, take three wickets and this match is the only <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> {{is known to have}} bowled. He is not recorded again until August 1793 {{when he played}} for Middlesex in a 22/11 odds match against an England XI. He played in two more matches {{over the next three years}} and then became a prolific player through the 1798 to 1800 seasons.|$|E

5000|$|The murderer is {{consistently}} identified as Joe Chill, although the mythos alternates between versions where Batman learns the killer's identity, and <b>ones</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> never finds out. Chill has also alternated {{between being a}} mugger who randomly selected the wealthy Waynes, and a hitman who murdered them intentionally (the former {{is the most common}} interpretation). Tim Burton's Batman departs from the most common interpretation by portraying a young Jack Napier, the future Joker, as the murderer.|$|R
25|$|Effi Briest was Fassbinder's dream {{film and}} the <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> {{invested}} the most work. While he normally took between nine and 20 days {{to make a}} film, this time it required 58 shooting days, dragged out over two years. The film is a period piece adapted from Theodor Fontane's classic novel of 1894, concerning the consequences of betrayed love. Set in the closed, repressive Prussian society of the Bismarck era, the film paints {{a portrait of a}} woman's fate completely linked to an unbending and utterly unforgiving code of social behavior. The plot follows the story of Effi Briest, a young woman who seeks to escape her stifling marriage to a much older man by entering into a brief affair with a charming soldier. Six years later, Effi's husband discovers her affair with tragic consequences.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Bjelke-Petersen {{formally}} advised Campbell to sack Ahern, Austin and McKechnie {{and call}} an early election. However, Ahern, Gunn and Austin told Campbell that Bjelke-Petersen {{no longer had}} enough parliamentary support to govern. While Campbell agreed to the ouster of Ahern, Gunn and Austin, {{he was reluctant to}} call fresh elections for a legislature that was only a year old. He thus concluded that the crisis was a political <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> should not be involved. He also believed that Bjelke-Petersen was no longer acting rationally. After Bjelke-Petersen refused numerous requests for a party meeting, the party's management committee called one for 26 November. At this meeting, a spill motion was carried by a margin of 38–9. Bjelke-Petersen boycotted the meeting, and thus did not nominate for the ensuing leadership vote, which saw Ahern elected as the new leader and Gunn elected as deputy.|$|E
25|$|During childhood, Willis {{developed}} {{an interest in}} art, and in 1988, he was featured in a Chicago public access documentary feature entitled Wesley Willis: Artist of the Streets. In Artist of the Streets, he was shown walking through Chicago's Loop neighborhood, producing his ink pen drawings outside of the Marshall Field and Company Building, and interacting with people curious about his art. The drawings typically encompass detailed Chicago streetscapes, including buildings, vehicles, trees, and landmarks. Willis {{was known for his}} ability to draw from memory a completely different location than the <b>one</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>he</b> was sitting. During his lifetime, he frequently gave his drawings away to friends or sold them for small amounts (typically $10 or $20) in Chicago parks. However, after his death, Willis began to receive recognition in the art community for his large body of visual art. In 2008 his artwork was exhibited at the Mohamed Khalil Museum of Egypt, and he {{was the subject of a}} special exhibit entitled Drawn By Wesley Willis at Dominican University.|$|E
