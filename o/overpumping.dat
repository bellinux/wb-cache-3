25|$|The {{public water}} supply system in Greater Beirut {{receives}} its water from the Jeita springs (50 million m3/year) as well as well fields in the Damour region (30 million m3/year). The Jeita spring {{is the source of}} drinking water for about 1.5 million Lebanese. Water is treated in the Dbaiye water treatment plant north of the city with a capacity of 430,000m3/day (157 million m3/year). Besides the public network, around 1,000 mostly private wells are scattered in the area of Beirut. Their depth varies between 50 and 300m and their average individual discharge is 35 liters/second. Total water supply from these wells could be higher than through the {{public water supply}}, depending on how many hours the pumps run. <b>Overpumping</b> from wells in the Beirut area has led to seawater intrusion into aquifers.|$|E

The protective layers separating the polluted sand units from the freshwater sand are observed to be relatively thin across the boreholes in this region.

25|$|However, such {{intensive}} agriculture {{in such an}} arid area has had a significant negative impact of water supplies. Eighty-eight percent of all water taken from {{above and below the}} surface is used for agriculture. One third of aquifers are overdrafted, especially in Caborca, Guaymas and the coast near Hermosillo. There have been water disputes in the state, notablely between officials from Hermosillo and the relatively water-rich Ciudad Obregón. The <b>overpumping</b> has drastically lowered water tables and has increased soil salinity in many areas. In some areas, the tables have dropped by as much as one or two meters per year, making fresh water increasing unavailable and forcing the abandonment of croplands.

25|$|With the {{exception}} of the Colorado River, river and aquifer systems in Sonora are a result of rains from incoming clouds rising above the Sierra Madre Occidental. This water runs down {{the west side of the}} mountains along the canyons and valleys towards the plains and coast and into the Gulf of California, Sonora has seven major rivers – the Colorado River, the Concepción River, the San Ignacio River, the Sonora River, the Mátepe River, the Yaqui River and the Mayo River. Dams, such as Alvaro Obregon, Adolfo Ruiz Cortines, Plutarco Elias Calles, Abelardo Rodriguez and Lazaro Cardenas, have been built along some of these rivers, at least two of them where natural lakes existed. Some of the dams formed large deltas, such as that of the Mayo River. The largest aquifers are mostly found between Hermosillo and coast, the Guaymas Valley and the area around Caborca.

40|$|We {{propose a}} more {{realistic}} version of the recently introduced split-step model (SSM), which consists of periodically alternating dispersive and nonlinear segments, by adding uniformly distributed loss and lumped gain to it. In the case when the loss is exactly balanced by gain, a family of stable equilibrium solitons (ESs) is found. Unless the system's period L is very small, saturation is observed in the dependence of the amplitude of the established ES vs. that of the initial pulse. Stable nonequilibrium solitons (NESs) {{are found in the}} case when the gain slightly exceeds (by up to 3 %) the value necessary to balance the loss. The existence of NESs is possible as the excessive energy pump is offset by permanent radiation loss, which is confirmed by computation of the corresponding Poynting vector. Unlike ESs that form a continuous family of solutions, NES is an isolated solution, which disappears in the limit of small L, i. e., it cannot be found in the <b>overpumped</b> nonlinear Schroedinger equation. Interactions between ESs turn out to be essentially the same as in SSM without loss and gain, while interactions between NESs are different: two NESs perturb each other by the radiation jets emanating from them, even if they are separated by a large distance. Moving NESs survive collisions, changing their velocities. Comment: a latex text file and seven jpg figure files. Physics Letter A, in pres...|$|R

50|$|An {{especially}} useful application of GIS concerns water quality in groundwater. For construction/situating of industrial plants, landfills, agricultural activities, and other potential groundwater contamination sources, {{it is useful}} to know how existing groundwater supplies could be affected or would be at risk of impact. Further, in the case of groundwater contamination and the need for subsequent containment and cleanup of the contaminant, an existing framework of the groundwater system would be valuable in planning remediation measures. This GIS could be the front end to a groundwater modeling simulation devised to fully capture the contaminant.An additional example concerning the use of GIS addresses a common problem associated with groundwater pumping and land subsidence or intrusion in coastal areas. Areas that have been overpumped of groundwater can subside, and when near the sea, this may invite flooding. Also, <b>overpumping</b> of groundwater in coastal regions may bring a different problem, such as the case in California where salt-water intrusion has compromised the aquifer. Generally, a salt water interface inland of the coast extends below the land surface dependent on the distance from the coast. <b>Overpumping</b> can bring the salt water interface to a higher position and contaminate an aquifer. A careful study and management of groundwater within GIS or with modeled GIS data can forestall or alleviate these problems.|$|E
