5|$|The {{first of}} the brigade's glider units, forty Waco gliders {{carrying}} the 64th Airlanding Light Battery Royal Artillery and their 75mm pack howitzers, landed at 09:20. The thirty-five larger Horsa gliders, transporting the 300th Airlanding Anti-Tank Battery and its equipment, failed to arrive, turning back to Italy due to an <b>overcast</b> <b>sky</b> at the landing zone. The Horsas returned with the afternoon's second wave landing at 15:04.|$|E
5|$|Two {{circling}} B-29s {{observed the}} test, with Shields again flying the lead plane. They carried members of Project Alberta, who would carry out airborne measurements during the atomic missions. These included Captain Deak Parsons, the Associate Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory {{and the head}} of Project Alberta; Luis Alvarez, Harold Agnew, Bernard Waldman, Wolfgang Panofsky and William Penney. The <b>overcast</b> <b>sky</b> obscured their view of the test site.|$|E
5|$|At 20:00, Troude ordered Hautpoult {{to steer}} to the {{northwest}} while he took Courageux and Polonais southwest {{in an effort to}} divide the pursuit. Pompee and Recruit kept with Hautpoult, while Neptune, accompanied by the brig HMS Hawk continued to follow Troude's main force. During the night however Troude outdistanced Neptune, and on the morning of 16 April Cochrane ordered all available ships to converge on Hautpoult. The lone French ship of the line had finally forced the damaged Recruit to retire, but could see Pompee and Neptune to the southeast and the newly arrived frigates HMS Latona under Captain Hugh Pigot and HMS Castor under Captain William Roberts to the northeast, with the Spanish coast of Puerto Rico directly north. During the day the chase continued, Neptune falling behind but Pompee remaining in sight and the frigates gaining on Hautpoult. At 17:00, Puerto Rico appeared on the horizon, the French forced to follow the coastline westwards. During the night, the British pursuers were confused by the <b>overcast</b> <b>sky,</b> which helped Hautpoult to partially obscure herself among the lights from shore.|$|E

40|$|Aerosol {{indirect}} effects {{are some of}} the largest uncertainties of anthropogenic climate change. To estimate the first aerosol indirect radiative effect (or cloud albedo effect), we analyzed global solar irradiance measurements under completely <b>overcast</b> <b>skies</b> during the recent period of aerosol optical depth decline in Europe. Although measurements from 15 Swiss and 8 northern German sites show clear evidence for an aerosol direct radiative effect under cloud-free skies, trends of transmitted solar irradiance (SWtran) under <b>overcast</b> <b>skies</b> are ambiguous. Time series from 1981 to 2005 of SWtran for all overcast conditions show slightly negative, but non-significant trends. SWtran under overcast conditions with “thick ” clouds (SWtran smaller than the long term mean) exhibits on average an increasing trend of + 0. 29 [+ 0. 01 to + 0. 57] Wm- 2 / decade. The increase of SWtran under “thick ” <b>overcast</b> <b>skies,</b> however, is about 9 times smaller than the increase under cloud-free skies. Since cirrus clouds are generally excluded from and low-level stratiform clouds are more frequently represented by “thick ” <b>overcast</b> <b>skies,</b> the slight increase in SWtran may possibly result from a weak aerosol indirect effect. Alternatively, the increase in SWtran may be due to a decreasing trend in low-level stratiform cloud amount under overcast conditions observed for these sites. W...|$|R

25|$|Danish {{archaeologist}} Thorkild Ramskou {{posited that}} the sunstone {{could have been}} one of the minerals (cordierite or Iceland spar) that polarize light and by which the azimuth of the sun can be determined in a partly <b>overcast</b> <b>sky</b> or when the sun is just below the horizon. The principle is used by many animals and polar flights applied the idea before more advanced techniques became available. Ramskou further conjectured that the sunstone could have aided navigation in the open sea in the Viking period. This idea has become very popular, and research as to how a sunstone could be used in nautical navigation continues.|$|E
25|$|Aboard the Boeing, {{the crew}} was {{preparing}} for arrival at JFK International, flying in clear air above an <b>overcast</b> <b>sky</b> with good visibility as they approached Carmel. The aircraft was being flown on autopilot with altitude-hold engaged, and the pilot, Capt. Thomas H. Carroll, had his left hand on the control yoke. On seeing an aircraft at his 10 o'clock position on {{what appeared to be}} a collision course, he immediately disengaged the autopilot, put the wheel hard over to the right, and pulled back on the yoke. His copilot, First Officer Leo M. Smith, also grabbed the controls and acted together with him. The aircraft rolled to the right and it became apparent that this maneuver would not allow the two aircraft to pass clear of each other, so Carroll and Smith attempted to reverse the wheel to the left and pushed on the yoke. Before the aircraft could react to the control reversal, two shocks were felt and the Boeing entered a steep dive; the Boeing's left wing had struck the tail of the Constellation and both aircraft were out of control.|$|E

Paula Cole sang God Bless America during the seventh-inning stretch. The first pitch was thrown by the National League's starter, Jake Peavy at 8:54 EDT [...] The game was completed in 3 hours, 6 minutes under an <b>overcast</b> <b>sky</b> and a gametime temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E
500|$|After nightfall on October 6, troops {{moved out}} in stormy weather to dig the first parallel: the heavily <b>overcast</b> <b>sky</b> negated the waning full moon and {{shielded}} the massive digging operation {{from the eyes}} of British sentries. Washington ceremoniously struck several blows with his pick axe to begin the trench. The trench was to be [...] long, running {{from the head of}} Yorktown to the York River. Half of the trench was to be commanded by the French, the other half by the Americans. On the northernmost end of the French line, a support trench was dug so that they could bombard the British ships in the river. The French were ordered to distract the British with a false attack, but the British were told of the plan by a French deserter and the British artillery fire turned on the French from the Fusiliers redoubt.|$|E

[...] In the first five minutes of the race, the lead changed hands three times. [...] First Oxford, then Cambridge drifted towards {{the centre of the}} river and were warned by the umpire. [...] Oxford turned away, but before Cambridge had time to do so, the two boats bumped. [...] The clash caused a rowing error by Cambridge's Luke Juckett, as he was bucked from his seat and nearly thrown overboard. [...] He did not recover until five strokes later.

Thousands of Sacramentans, startled by a terrific explosion, looked skyward and saw the crippled and burning four-motored bomber emerge from the <b>overcast</b> <b>sky</b> and fall. Only one member of the plane's crew of 14 escaped the flaming wreckage, parachuting to safety before the crash. He was Maj. James H. Wergen of Kingman field, Ariz., the bomber's home base.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that diffuse radiation from cloudy and <b>overcast</b> <b>skies</b> penetrates the canopy more effectively than direct radiation from clear skies. We compared the flux density and spectral properties of direct and diffuse radiation (around solar noon (+/- 1 h)) above, within and below a forest stand under sunny, cloudy and overcast conditions in a thinned Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis (Bong.) Carr.) forest (28 years old, with a leaf area index of approximately 5. 2 m(2) m(- 2)). We recorded vertical profiles of radiation penetration (from 350 to 1050 nm), and we also explored the horizontal pattern of radiation along a 115 m transect. We showed that in "clear sky" conditions, the photosynthetically active radiation in the lower parts of the canopy was substantially attenuated, more so than under cloudy and <b>overcast</b> <b>skies.</b> It was particularly depleted in the blue part of the spectrum, but only slightly blue-depleted when the <b>sky</b> was <b>overcast</b> or cloudy. Moreover, the red : far-red ratio under clear skies fell to values less than 0. 3 but only to 0. 6 under cloudy or <b>overcast</b> <b>skies.</b> Near the ground, the light climate was strongly influenced by the thinning pattern (carried out in accordance with standard forestry management practice) ...|$|R
