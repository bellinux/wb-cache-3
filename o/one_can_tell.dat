25|$|The {{process of}} row {{reduction}} {{makes use of}} elementary row operations, and {{can be divided into}} two parts. The first part (sometimes called Forward Elimination) reduces a given system to row echelon form, from which <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> whether there are no solutions, a unique solution, or infinitely many solutions. The second part (sometimes called back substitution) continues to use row operations until the solution is found; in other words, it puts the matrix into reduced row echelon form.|$|E

25|$|The {{substitution}} rule demonstrates several common {{aspects of}} rules of inference. It is entirely syntactical; <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> {{whether it was}} correctly applied without appeal to any interpretation. It has (syntactically defined) limitations on when it can be applied, which must be respected to preserve the correctness of derivations. Moreover, {{as is often the}} case, these limitations are necessary because of interactions between free and bound variables that occur during syntactic manipulations of the formulas involved in the inference rule.|$|E
25|$|The {{interpretation}} of an n-ary predicate symbol {{is a set}} of n-tuples of elements of the domain of discourse. This means that, given an interpretation, a predicate symbol, and n elements of the domain of discourse, <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> whether the predicate is true of those elements according to the given interpretation. For example, an interpretation I(P) of a binary predicate symbol P may be the set of pairs of integers such that the first one is less than the second. According to this interpretation, the predicate P would be true if its first argument is less than the second.|$|E

When Zhong Hui was four years old, his father sent him to meet Jiang Ji, who noted that the boy was extraordinary. By the time Zhong Hui reached adulthood, he was already famous for being hardworking, well read, and versed in different types of arts. During the Zhengshi era (240–249) of the reign of Cao Fang, he served as a Gentleman Cadet of the Imperial Library (秘書郎) and was later promoted to Attendant Gentleman of the Palace Writers and Masters of Writing (尚書中書侍郎). He was awarded the title of a Secondary Marquis (爵關內) when Cao Mao ascended the throne in 254.|$|E

25|$|A {{familiar}} {{example of}} SSB is in ferromagnetic materials. Microscopically, the material consists of atoms with a non-vanishing spin, {{each of which}} acts like a tiny bar magnet, i.e., a magnetic dipole. The Hamiltonian of the material, describing the interaction of neighbouring dipoles, is invariant under rotations. At high temperature, there is no magnetization of a large sample of the material. Then one says that the symmetry of the Hamiltonian is realized by the system. However, at low temperature, there could be an overall magnetization. This magnetization has a preferred direction, since <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> the north magnetic pole of the sample from the south magnetic pole. In this case, there is spontaneous symmetry breaking of the rotational symmetry of the Hamiltonian.|$|E
25|$|Cycling in Melbourne is {{a popular}} pastime, as <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> from the bevy of cyclists and paths that lie all {{throughout}} the city, {{as well as a}} spectator sport. Melbourne's flat terrain and extensive off-road paths in green wedges are conducive to riding. Beach Road combines with the Nepean Highway to form a 90-kilometre stretch from Port Melbourne to Sorrento, incorporating the Bayside Trail. It is the city's most popular training route and attracts cyclists from around the world. Thousands of commuters cycle the roads, bike lanes and bike paths daily. Bicycle Victoria's annual events, Around the Bay in a Day and Ride to Work Day, attract tens of thousands of Melburnians. Other events such as the Herald Sun Tour begin and end in the Melbourne area and there are many local cycling events of varying grades all year round.|$|E
25|$|The salmon {{fisheries}} of the Columbia River are now but {{a fraction}} of what they were twenty-five years ago, and what they would be now if the United States Government had taken complete charge of them by intervening between Oregon and Washington. During these twenty-five years the fishermen of each State have naturally tried to take all they could get, and the two legislatures {{have never been able to}} agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree for the protection of the fisheries. At the moment the fishing on the Oregon side is practically closed, while there is no limit on the Washington side of any kind, and no <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> what the courts will decide as to the very statutes under which this action and non-action result. Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle between the associated, or gill-net, fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to the performances, [...] "Telethon" [...] included several references to previous episodes. During the telethon, Andy and his band perform a song called [...] "Sex Hair". This is a reference to [...] "Galentine's Day", in which {{he claims to have}} written a song about how <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> whether someone had sex because their hair is matted. A music video for the song was made available on the official NBC.com Parks and Recreation website shortly after the episode was broadcast. Also in [...] "Telethon," [...] the television event is sponsored by the candy manufacturer Sweetums, and Leslie constantly eats their Nutri-Yum bars in order to stay awake. Both the company and candy bars were prominently featured by [...] "Sweetums", where Leslie and Ann fought to prevent the unhealthy snacks from being sold in Pawnee parks.

Club {{praised the}} episode for {{displaying}} some of Leslie's {{stronger and more}} competent aspects, which he said makes audiences [...] "much more {{willing to put up}} with her many, many eccentricities". Heisler said he thought the Leslie and Justin relationship ended appropriately and praised Ansari's performance, but added he was a little [...] "taken aback" [...] by how rudely Tom treated Wendy. Matt Fowler of IGN said the episode had many funny moments and good character development, but he said some of the romantic relationships risked skewing the balance between [...] "the sweet and the absurd", and that some of the character moments [...] "played out a bit too jarringly real for a show like this". Kona Gallagher of TV Squad said she would like to see Leslie get a boyfriend who last longer than three episodes, unlike Justin Theroux and Louis C.K., who played Leslie's love interest Dave Sanderson earlier in the season. Gallagher praised Andy's band and the befuddlement with which Andy reacted to the senior citizen audience. [...] Mike Murphy of The Press Democrat said the episode was funny, and he particularly praised the [...] "hilariously whacked-out" [...] performance of John Laroquette. Several commentators praised the joke about Andy's new rock song [...] "Sex Hair", about how <b>one</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> whether someone had sex because their hair is matted.|$|E

Ozma, the twenty-seven soldiers of the Royal Army of Oz, including the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and Tik-Tok all suffer this bizarre fate.
