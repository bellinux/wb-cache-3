5|$|Farm {{animals are}} {{widespread}} {{in books and}} songs for children; the reality of animal husbandry is often distorted, softened, or idealized, giving children an almost entirely fictitious account of farm life. The books often depict a rural idyll <b>of</b> <b>happy</b> animals free to roam in attractive countryside, which is completely {{at odds with the}} realities of the impersonal, mechanized activities involved in modern intensive farming.|$|E
5|$|It {{was finally}} {{accepted}} by BBC North in 1986, {{a result of}} a spare budget being assigned for a second series <b>of</b> <b>Happy</b> Families that would never arise, and producer Paul Jackson's insistence that Red Dwarf should be filmed instead. The show was lucky to be remounted after an electricians' strike partway through rehearsals in early 1987 shut the entire production down (the title sequence was filmed in January 1987). The filming was rescheduled for September, and the pilot episode finally made it onto television screens on 15 February 1988.|$|E

25|$|From a {{bottom-up}} perspective, happiness {{represents an}} accumulation <b>of</b> <b>happy</b> experiences. Bottom-up influences include external events, and broad situational and demographic factors, including health and marital status.

In support of this view, there is evidence that daily pleasurable events are associated with increased positive affect, and daily unpleasant events or hassles are associated with increased negative affect.|$|E
