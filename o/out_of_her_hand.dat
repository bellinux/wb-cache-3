5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag and her head is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.|$|E

Her first task is to kidnap Martha Kent with her spouse, and stating that she and Kal-L wish for Kal-El, Connor Kent, and Martha, to be reunited with Jonathan Kent in death. She proved unable to deal with the resourcefulness of Martha Kent, and was set ablaze by the widow, but kept regenerating until Krypto intervened, ripping the black ring <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and preventing regeneration for long enough to allow Superman and Conner Kent to destroy the Black Lantern powerhouses attacking Smallville, and reaching town to aid others unhindered.|$|E
25|$|The Queen {{turns into}} an old lady and tries to force Kilala to eat a poison apple, making the dogs hold down Rei. Snow White appears and tells The Queen that, to save Kilala, she will eat the apple instead. Just before she can, however, Kilala knocks the apple <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> telling The Queen {{no one will be}} eating that apple and the Seven Dwarfs appear.

Afterwards, Snow White gives Kilala a ruby, which {{attaches}} itself to the Tiara and changes her and Rei back to normal. The Gate reappears and the two leave Snow White's world, following the light back to their world, which leads them to Erika. Rei questions why they would leave her behind, but then realizes it must be because she is not the Seventh Princess.|$|E

500|$|The {{player can}} move with weapons drawn and use {{automatic}} targeting functions. Enemies can knock Regina's weapon <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> {{at which point}} she'll have to retrieve it. Sometimes [...] "DANGER" [...] may flash on the screen in perilous situations, {{at which point the}} player should push all the controller buttons as rapidly as possible to survive. If Regina becomes injured, she will hold her arm or struggle to walk. Med Paks can be used to heal Regina's health. Sometimes a trail of blood may appear, indicating that Regina is bleeding and will continue to lose health. Hemostats can be used to stop bleeding injuries. Two types of medical supplies are available in the game: Med Paks, which heals player health, and Hemostats, which stop bleeding injuries. If Regina dies, the player may continue from the room she died in. After five [...] "Continues" [...] are exhausted, the player must continue from their last save point.|$|E
500|$|In 1927, under {{pressure}} from his family, Valdemar decided against providing Tschaikovsky with any further financial support, and the funds from Denmark were cut off. Duke George of Leuchtenberg, a distant relative of the Tsar, gave her a home at Castle Seeon. The Tsarina's brother, Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse, hired a private detective, Martin Knopf, to investigate the claims that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia. During her stay at Castle Seeon, Knopf reported that Tschaikovsky was actually a Polish factory worker called Franziska Schanzkowska. Schanzkowska had worked in a munitions factory during World War I when, shortly after her fiancé had been killed at the front, a grenade fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and exploded. She had been injured in the head, and a foreman was killed in front of her. She became apathetic and depressed, was declared insane on 19 September 1916, and spent time in two lunatic asylums. In early 1920, she was reported missing from her Berlin lodgings, and since then had not been seen or heard from by her family. In May 1927, Franziska's brother Felix Schanzkowski was introduced to Tschaikovsky at a local inn in Wasserburg near Castle Seeon. Leuchtenberg's son, Dmitri, was completely certain that Tschaikovsky was an impostor {{and that she was}} recognized by Felix as his sister, but Leuchtenberg's daughter, Natalie, remained convinced of Tschaikovsky's authenticity. Leuchtenberg himself was ambivalent. According to one account, initially Felix declared that Tschaikovsky was his sister Franziska, but the affidavit he signed spoke only of a [...] "strong resemblance", highlighted physical differences, and said she did not recognize him. Years later, Felix's family said that he knew Tschaikovsky was his sister, but he had chosen to leave her to her new life, which was far more comfortable than any alternative.|$|E
2500|$|On 25 January 2007, Joe {{unexpectedly}} {{returns to}} the Fowlers' house, much to the horror of Pauline's friend Dot Branning (June Brown), who is inside {{the house at the}} time. Joe reveals to Dot that he had gone back to the house on Christmas Day to try to patch things up with Pauline, but that she harshly told him that he [...] was leaving, not her, and continued to insult him and his ways. He told Pauline he felt like lashing out at times, and she dared him to [...] "be a man" [...] and hit her. Joe then describes how, In an anger, he picked up a frying pan and hit Pauline hard on the head with it. He left the house after the incident, at which point Pauline was fine, {{and that was the last}} time he saw his wife, who later died due to a brain haemorrhage caused by the blow to the head Joe had given her. Dot then proceeds to try to convince Joe to tell the truth but he refuses. She then attempts to ring the police but Joe snatches the phone <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and throws it away. Dot's husband, Jim (John Bardon) meanwhile, arrives at the Fowlers' house to find Dot. Seeing that Joe is holding Dot captive, Jim rushes over to save her and a struggle that follows results in Joe falling back and crashing out of a window and falling through a market stall. Jim looks out of the window as Joe lies on the street, dead.|$|E

2500|$|The next week, Kim {{notices that}} Ray has {{a string of}} missed calls on his mobile phone, and {{suspects}} he is having an affair. All About Soap said that Ray is showing all the signs of having an affair, but has no scenes with Kat, which they said would be [...] "crucial" [...] if he {{was having an affair}} with her. They went on to say that if Ray reveals what he is up to, he could be the first suspect to be eliminated. Soaplife said that Kat never has her mobile <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> so when Kim catches Ray texting a mystery woman, it could mean that he is texting Kat. Inside Soap also wondered if this was evidence of Ray being Kat's secret lover. Carena Crawford from All About Soap said that when Ray is seen with flowers heading for the tube and on the phone saying he is meeting the person he is speaking to, at the same time Kat is on her phone arranging to meet her lover, she thought it was [...] "the biggest clue yet" [...] that it could be Ray, especially when they later return to the pub at the same time. Inside Soap noticed in that week that episodes were [...] "desperately trying to rule out Jack" [...] when he has sex with three other women. They felt it could be a red herring, saying [...] "We reckon all this seduction is supposed to make us turn a blind eye to Jack's antics—but [...] we're keeping them peeled where [...] is concerned!" [...] They also wondered how he could find the time to meet these women if he was seeing Kat as well.|$|E

60|$|He {{moved about}} {{the room with a}} certain sureness of touch, swift and {{relentless}} and quiet. She knew she could not cope with him.

60|$|This was {{not easy}} to answer, coming from a prince who had no small {{experience}} in premature bridals coming to nothing, and Christina felt that the matter was taken <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and that she had no more to do but to enjoy the warm-hearted Kaisar's praises <b>of</b> <b>her</b> son.|$|R
