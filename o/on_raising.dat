5|$|Coutances {{had long}} {{experience}} in the chancery, but little experience with judicial matters. Most of his efforts while in the justiciarship were centred <b>on</b> <b>raising</b> Richard's ransom. As evidence of this emphasis <b>on</b> <b>raising</b> money, Coutances sent out few itinerant justices during his time in power. Six groups of justices were sent out in 1192, but in 1193 none were sent out, and even the justices based in Westminster held few sessions. Of those justices appointed, like his predecessor in the justiciarship, Coutances used justices {{from a wide range}} of backgrounds, and many of those sent out on itinerent rounds were local to the area, rather than the increasingly professional justices used under Coutances' successor Hubert Walter. The justiciarship during this period was less connected to justice and was more closely tied to the Exchequer, or treasury of England, and most of the power in the office derived from its control of the Exchequer.|$|E

She tells Terri she wants to keep the baby, but {{in an effort to}} change her mind, Terri's sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen) has Quinn babysit her three unruly sons. Quinn invites Puck to babysit with her and the two bond, however when Quinn discovers that Puck spent the evening sexting his ex-girlfriend Santana (Naya Rivera), she re-commits to having the baby adopted, believing her daughter deserves a better father.|$|E
40|$|A field {{experiment}} compared two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cropping systems: paddy or raised beds with continuous furrow irrigation; and trialled four cultivars: Starbonnet, Lemont, Amaroo and Ceysvoni, and one test line YRL 39; that may vary in adaptation to growth <b>on</b> <b>raised</b> beds. The grain yield of rice ranged from 740 to 1250 g/m(2) and was slightly greater in paddy than <b>on</b> <b>raised</b> beds. Although there were early growth responses to fertilizer nitrogen <b>on</b> <b>raised</b> beds, the crop nitrogen content at maturity mostly exceeded 20 g/m(2) in both systems, so nitrogen {{was unlikely to}} have limited yield. Ceysvoni yielded best in both systems, a result of good post-anthesis growth and larger grain size, although its whole-grain mill-out percentage was poor relative to the other cultivars. Starbonnet and Lemont yielded poorly <b>on</b> <b>raised</b> beds, associated with too few tillers and too much leaf area. When grown <b>on</b> <b>raised</b> beds all cultivars experienced a delay in anthesis resulting in more tillers, leaf area and dry weight at anthesis, and probably a greater yield potential. The growth of rice after anthesis, however, was similar <b>on</b> <b>raised</b> beds and in paddy, so reductions in harvest index and grain size <b>on</b> <b>raised</b> beds were recorded. The data indicated that water supply was not a major limitation to rice growth <b>on</b> <b>raised</b> beds, but slower crop development was an issue that would affect the use of raised beds in a cropping system, especially in rice-growing areas where temperatures are too cool for optimal crop development.

5|$|Zheng and Shuying {{returned}} to Putian where Huang Na {{was buried in}} a tomb halfway up a mountain near their house. While alive, Huang Na had asked that her surname be changed to her stepfather's, so her altar tablet bore the name Zheng Na. The couple decided to focus <b>on</b> <b>raising</b> their remaining child, with Zheng planning to pursue business opportunities in Guangzhou or Shenzhen. In January 2007, Jack Neo considered making a movie about the murder, but both families objected. A follow-up report in 2009 found that Shuying {{had given birth to}} another two children and was running a shoe distribution business in Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|After her parents' {{separation}} in 1976, Jolie and {{her brother}} lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus <b>on</b> <b>raising</b> her children. Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require {{her to go to}} church. As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting, though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982). When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York; they returned to Los Angeles five years later. Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.|$|E
5|$|The 2001 dive season {{concentrated}} <b>on</b> <b>raising</b> the ship's {{steam engine}} and condenser. Hull plates {{had to be}} removed to access the engine compartment and both the engine and the condenser had to be separated from the ship, the surrounding wreckage and each other. A Mini Rover ROV was used to provide visibility of the wreck and divers to the support staff above water. The engine was raised on 16 July and the condenser three days later by the crane barge Wotan. Saturation diving was evaluated by the Navy that dive season on Monitor and proved to be very successful, allowing divers to maximize their time on the bottom. The surface-supplied divers evaluated the use of heliox due to the depth of the wreck. It also proved to be successful once the dive tables were adjusted.|$|E

5|$|The Attorney General of Virginia, Mary Sue Terry, prosecuted eight LaRouche {{organizations}} {{on charges}} of securities fraud relating to $30million in loans. The first trials were in Leesburg, but later trials moved to the larger city of Roanoke. In order for the prosecutions to proceed, {{a decision by the}} State Corporation Commission (SCC) was needed verifying that the loans solicited by LaRouche organizations were securities. Attorneys for the LaRouche organizations argued that a prohibition <b>on</b> <b>raising</b> funds through loans would violate their First Amendment rights. The SCC rejected that argument and decided, on March 4, 1987, that the promissory notes were securities. It ordered six LaRouche organizations—Fusion Energy Foundation Inc., Caucus Distributors Inc., Publication and General Management Inc., Campaigner Publications Inc., EIR News Service Inc. and Publication Equities Inc.—to stop their sale. Five other states had already issued injunctions, and 14 states eventually followed. At least one injunction, by the State of Minnesota against Independent Democrats for LaRouche, was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which confirmed the lower court ruling.|$|E
