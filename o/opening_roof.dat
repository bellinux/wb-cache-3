500|$|The castle {{began to}} deteriorate, and the {{antiquarian}} John Britton noted {{during his visit}} in 1813 {{that it had been}} [...] "abandoned to neglect, and rapidly advancing to ruin: the glass is destroyed, the ceilings and floors are falling, and the rains streams through the <b>opening</b> <b>roof</b> on the damp and mouldering walls". The smithy {{in the basement of the}} south tower resulted in a fire in 1830, which caused considerable damage to the castle, gutting the south tower. Extensive decay in the bases of the cruck tresses in the castle's roof posed a particular threat to the hall, as the decaying roof began to push the walls apart.|$|E

5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation <b>openings,</b> <b>roof</b> <b>openings</b> or cables.|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} {{was developed}} to predict the effectiveness of openings in naturally, ventilated agricultural buildings. Validation was conducted in a wind tunnel using scale models under isothermal conditions. Wind angle of incidence, wind velocity, the ratio of height to width of <b>openings</b> and <b>roof</b> slope were varied. Wind angle of incidence and wind velocity had the greatest influence on opening effectiveness. Changes in the ratio of height to width of <b>openings</b> and <b>roof</b> slope had measurable but smaller effects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAn {{experimental}} study is conducted {{to understand the}} gas temperature rise in the roof vented enclosure, and to analysis the influence of <b>roof</b> <b>opening</b> area on the fire development. This influence {{is of particular interest}} in the strategic decision of fire fighting and risk assessment. One 3 m × 3 m × 1. 95 m compartment and four diameters of heptane pool fire were used. The fire size has strong influence, while the <b>roof</b> <b>opening</b> area has weak influence on the average rate of gas temperature rise. In the early stage of a fire, the fire development will slow down with the increase of <b>roof</b> <b>opening</b> area. For a relatively large fire, on the contrary, the fire is leaded to higher peak temperature as the increase of <b>roof</b> <b>opening</b> area...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} factor affecting thermal comfort of people in hot humid climate like Malaysia is high level of solar radiation, air temperature and humidity. This country exposed towards solar radiation more than 10 hours/day throughout the year. The solar radiation propagated heat in the indoor spaces through the building envelope. Low slope roof in Malaysia typically trap heat due {{to the absence of}} roof ventilation, the heat takes long time to be released. The heat will be transmitted to the area underneath the roof and affect the living space area. For this study, 10 ° roof angle with 50 % and 100 % opening had been chosen as retrofit roofing system to investigate the effect of the <b>roof</b> <b>openings</b> towards the air temperature underneath. 0 % <b>roof</b> <b>opening</b> (fully closed) <b>roofing</b> system has been chosen as the base case study for this experimental work. The results obtained indicate that the existence of <b>roof</b> <b>opening</b> is crucial to reduce the air temperature in the living area. By having <b>roof</b> <b>opening,</b> the air temperature could be improved about 3 to 6 °C for 50 % opening and 2 to 10 °C for 100 % for 10 ° roof angles. The <b>roof</b> <b>opening</b> has a great potential to create the heat losses and allow the air movement through the roof and indirectly decrease the indoor air temperature...|$|R
50|$|A {{range of}} funnel-shaped self-discharging wagons is also classed as special wagons.

50|$|A covered goods wagon or van is {{a railway}} goods wagon which is {{designed}} for the transportation of moisture-susceptible goods and therefore fully enclosed by sides and a fixed roof. They are often referred to simply as covered wagons, {{and this is the}} term used by the International Union of Railways (UIC). Since the introduction of the international classification for goods wagons by the UIC in the 1960s a distinction has been drawn between ordinary and special covered wagons. Other types of wagon, such as refrigerated vans and goods wagons with <b>opening</b> <b>roofs,</b> are closely related to covered wagons from a design point of view.|$|R

It is a three story masonry structure, built out of load-bearing brick set on a granite foundation. It has a gabled roof with projection hip-roofed sections, and a four-story tower at one corner, topped by a truncated pyramidal roof. Windows are of a variety of sizes, but are generally set in round-arched openings. Bands of cut stone provide horizontal emphasis.

50|$|The {{design team}} of Achim Menges, Steffen Reichert, and David Correa are {{interested}} in using 4D printed programmable matter to act as self-opening roof and facade systems. Common adaptive facades and <b>opening</b> <b>roofs</b> require intricate mechanical systems to operate which are often difficult to install and frequently malfunction. 4D printed facades would offer simplicity of installation and direct actuation caused by weather conditions, eliminating any need for a larger controlling system or input energy. The project Hygroskin Pavilion is a small scale example of this concept that uses a mix of 4D printed composites as well as maple veneers {{in the shape of}} scales that warp with humidity to make passively operating apertures. These apertures open to allow for ventilation in high humidity and close to allow for shading in low humidity.|$|R
