500|$|Production on the band's sixth studio album {{began as}} a result of a series of events in which Shinoda decided to drop the {{electronic}} and experimental sound of the band's previous two studio albums. Shinoda had originally recorded and produced demos, which continued the sound of A Thousand Suns and Living Things, for the band's sixth studio album during the band's Living Things World Tour in 2013. He presented the demos to his bandmates, which received positive reception from the rest of the band, and to Rubin, who was also positive towards the demos, though describing them to Shinoda as more [...] "poppy" [...] than he expected. However, Shinoda, after listening to the demos again after the end of the tour, felt a strong negativity towards his material, especially after Rubin's statements. In a Warner Music interview, Shinoda stated that [...] "I don't even believe in this music. This is a mistake; I don't like what I'm making. I kind <b>of</b> <b>went</b> backwards into the process and scrapped all of it and started new stuff." ...|$|E

[...] "After the attacks the world kind <b>of</b> <b>went</b> into freeze mode and we didn't know whether to carry on with things or not... so we decided we'd rather everyone was safe and play the shows a little later instead," [...] said Hoppus shortly thereafter. The European dates were canceled a second time after DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back. With time off from touring, DeLonge felt an [...] "itch to do something where he didn't feel locked in to what Blink was", and channeled his chronic back pain and resulting frustration into Box Car Racer (2002), a post-hardcore disc that further explores his Fugazi and Refused inspiration. Refraining from paying for a studio drummer, he invited Barker to record drums on the project, which led Hoppus to feel betrayed. The event caused great division within the trio for some time and an unresolved tension at the forefront of the band's later hiatus.|$|E

500|$|A {{significant}} [...] in {{the development}} of hip-hop was the addition of eight-counts, a method of counting dance steps to stay in sync with the music. Toni Basil introduced this studio technique into locking in the 1970s. Basil was trained in ballet before being introduced to street dance by Don Campbell, the creator of locking and founding member of The Lockers dance crew. She is responsible for teaching the rest of The Lockers how to dance to counts. In an interview with NPR, Lockers member Adolfo [...] "Shabba-Doo" [...] Quiñones stated [...] "I would say that Toni Basil was sort of our Abe Saperstein in terms of how she was able to organize us into a professional dance troupe. I remember her teaching us how to count music. She was like, okay, we were like, count music? How do you count soul? It was crazy, you know?... all of our cues kind <b>of</b> <b>went</b> something like this, boom, pop, do boom, pada da boom, pada like that. And she was like, how do you guys get in sync like that? I said it's a feeling, you know?" [...] Traditionally hip-hop dance, or any form of street dance, is not performed to counts as these styles were created on the street rather than in a studio setting. So the introduction of counts was a pivotal move into bringing hip-hop dance from the street into the studio. Even with this addition, it would be years before commercial hip-hop developed into its current form.|$|E

30|$|XRD {{patterns}} <b>of</b> <b>GO,</b> ERGO, and ERGO/CNTs {{also reveal}} the electrochemical reduction <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> into ERGO after the mixing with CNTs (as shown in Fig.  3 b). As for GO, {{an additional peak at}} 10.3 ° is observed, which {{is attributed to}} the (001) diffraction peak <b>of</b> <b>GO.</b> The larger interlayer distance <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> nanosheets might be due to the existence of oxygen-containing functional groups on the sheet surface [30]. After the electrochemical reduction, the (001) diffraction peak <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> disappears and a broad diffraction peak (002) approximately 24.3 ° appears. The interlayer spacing of ERGO was 0.39  nm, slightly larger than that of graphite, which was resulted from the small amount of residual oxygen-containing functional groups or other structural defects. Besides the feeble and broad diffraction peak (002), the ERGO/CNTs also show a weak diffraction peak at 8.4 °. We conclude that comes from the mixing <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> with CNTs, and this mixing structure leads to the shift of diffraction peak after electrochemical reduction <b>of</b> <b>GO.</b>|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} simulated gastric conditions upon the anti-Helicobacter pylori effects <b>of</b> garlic oil (<b>GO).</b> METHODS AND RESULTS: Time course viability experiments assessed the anti-H. pylori activity <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> (16 and 32 microg ml(- 1)) in simulated gastric environments. Rapid anti-H. pylori action <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> was observed in artificial gastric juice. Mucus (1 - 5 %) was strongly protective of H. pylori both alone and in the presence <b>of</b> <b>GO,</b> but its protective effect was antagonized by GO. Peptone (5 - 15 g l(- 1)) caused a dose-dependent reduction in the anti-H. pylori activity <b>of</b> <b>GO.</b> Rapeseed oil (5. 7 - 17 g l(- 1)) greatly diminished the anti-H. pylori activity <b>of</b> <b>GO.</b> Dextrin (44 and 133 g l(- 1)) exhibited direct anti-H. pylori effects and added to those <b>of</b> <b>GO.</b> Simulated meal mixtures decreased but did not eliminate the anti-H. pylori activity of 32 mug ml(- 1) GO. CONCLUSIONS: The anti-H. pylori activity <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> was noticeably affected by food materials and mucin. However, substantial activity remained under simulated gastric conditions. Further investigation of the therapeutic potential <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> against H. pylori is therefore warranted.

40|$|Abstract Background Much {{effort is}} {{currently}} made {{to develop the}} Gene Ontology (GO). Due to the dynamic nature of information it addresses, GO undergoes constant updates whose results are released at regular intervals as separate versions. Although there are {{a large number of}} computational tools to aid the development <b>of</b> <b>GO,</b> they are operating on a particular version <b>of</b> <b>GO,</b> making it difficult for GO curators to anticipate the full impact of particular changes along the time axis on a larger scale. We present a method for tapping into such an evolutionary aspect <b>of</b> <b>GO,</b> by making it possible to keep track of important temporal changes to any of the terms and relations <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> and by consequently making it possible to recognize associated trends. Results We have developed visualization methods for viewing the changes between two different versions <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> by constructing a colour-coded layered graph. The graph shows both versions <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> with highlights to those GO terms that are added, removed and modified between the two versions. Focusing on a specific GO term or terms of interest over a period, we demonstrate the utility of our system {{that can be used to}} make useful hypotheses about the cause of the evolution and to provide new insights into more complex changes. Conclusions GO undergoes fast evolutionary changes. A snapshot <b>of</b> <b>GO,</b> as presented by each version <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> alone, overlooks such evolutionary aspects, and consequently limits the utilities <b>of</b> <b>GO.</b> The method that highlights the differences of consecutive versions or two different versions of an evolving ontology with colour-coding enhances the utility <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> for users as well as for developers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first proposal to visualize the evolutionary aspect <b>of</b> <b>GO.</b> </p...|$|R

[...] Coletti assumed the singer was so mortified that she fled immediately, though later assumed the incident was a possible [...] "set up", adding it was the last time he had spoken to her. Coletti's assumption is potentially another reason for Jackson's blacklisting on MTV in addition to other music channels and radio formats. An MTV representative confirmed the costume tear was conceptualized by the MTV staff, in which the show's producers mockingly ripped their clothing in response to Timberlake's closing lyric during rehearsals. This led to Jackson and Timberlake improvising the move, in which Timberlake tore off Jackson's kilt. Frattini stated, [...] "When we did the original rehearsal, there was conversation about a fake skirt she would wear, and that Justin would actually pull open the skirt and take off the skirt.

In this review, we summarize recent developments and present a comprehensive understanding <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> LCs via many aspects ranging from the exfoliation <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> flakes from graphite, to phases and phase transitions under various conditions, the orientational responses <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> under external magnetic and electric fields, and finally Kerr effect and display applications. The {{emphasis is placed on}} the unique and basic properties <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> and their ordered assembly. We will also discuss challenges and issues that need to be overcome in order to gain a more fundamental understanding and exploit full device potentials <b>of</b> <b>GO</b> LCs.|$|R
