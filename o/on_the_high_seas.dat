5|$|Mary Celeste was not {{the first}} {{reported}} case of a ship being found strangely deserted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>seas.</b> Rupert Gould, a naval officer and investigator of maritime mysteries, lists several such occurrences between 1840 and 1855. Whatever the truth of these stories, it is the Mary Celeste that is remembered; the ship's name, or the misspelt Marie Celeste, has become fixed in people's minds as synonymous with inexplicable desertion.|$|E
5|$|One hundred {{thousand}} soldiers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> in {{a multitude of}} transports converged on Gibraltar. More than 400 aircraft of all types were crammed into the dispersal areas around the Gibraltar runway. Fighters had been shipped in crates and assembled on the airfield. Every available area of storage was taken up with ammunition, fuel, and other essential supplies. 168 American pilots were housed in the RAF messes at North Front.|$|E
5|$|After over a {{month in}} port, U-37 {{departed}} with a new captain, Oberleutnant zur See Asmus Nicolai Clausen on 28 November for operations around north-west Africa and Spain. Seven ships were sunk during this patrol; two French, two Swedish, two British and one Spanish. Of these seven ships, three were in convoy {{at the time of}} their sinking. The Swedish Gwalia and Daphne and the British Jeanne M were sailing as part of convoy OG 46 from Britain to Gibraltar. The French vessels, the oiler Rhône and the submarine Sfax belonged to Vichy France and were sunk in error. After five weeks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>seas,</b> U-37 returned to Lorient on 14 January 1941.|$|E

5|$|Federal {{agencies}} filed {{charges against}} the KD IIs owner, operator and captain. They further sought forfeiture of the fins under in rem jurisdiction, resulting in the unusual case title. Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz granted the order in 2005. The boat's owners appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which reversed Moskowitz three years later. It held that the seizure was illegal for three reasons: the KD IIs activities {{did not meet the}} definition of a fishing vessel under the Magnuson–Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Since it did not, under the SFPA, the fins could not have been lawfully seized <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>seas.</b> In 2011, President Barack Obama signed the Shark Conservation Act into law, which closed these loopholes.|$|E
5|$|Typewriter in the Sky is {{a science}} fiction novel written by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. The protagonist Mike de Wolf finds himself inside {{the story of his}} friend Horace Hackett's book. He must survive {{conflict}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> in the Caribbean during the 17th century, before eventually returning to his native New York City. Each time a significant event occurs to the protagonist in the story he hears the sounds of a typewriter in the sky. At the story's conclusion, de Wolf wonders if he is still a character in someone else's story. The work was first published in a two-part serial format in 1940 in Unknown Fantasy Fiction. It was twice published as a combined book with Hubbard's work Fear. In 1995 Bridge Publications re-released the work along with an audio edition.|$|E
5|$|On 30April, President and Congress {{sailed through}} the {{blockade}} on their third cruise of the war. On 2May, they pursued , but she outran them and escaped. President parted company with Congress on 8May, and Rodgers set a course along the Gulf Stream {{to search for}} merchant ships to capture. By June, not having come across a single ship, President turned north; she put into North Bergen, Norway, on 27June to replenish her drinking water. Sailing soon after, President captured two British merchant ships, which helped to replenish her stores. On 10 June President captured the outward-bound Falmouth packet Duke of Montrose, Captain Aaron Groub Blewett, which managed to throw her mails overboard before President could send a prize crew aboard. President made a cartel of Duke of Montrose, putting all of Presidents prisoners on board and then sending her into Falmouth {{under the command of}} an American officer. When Duke of Montrose arrived at Falmouth the British Government abrogated the cartel {{on the grounds that they}} had advised the American Government that the British would not recognize agreements entered into <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>seas.</b>|$|E
25|$|The expeditionaries had {{returned}} to the ships without the fresh water that had been the original reason to land. Furthermore, they saw their crew reduced by more than fifty men, many of them sailors, which combined with the great number of the seriously injured made it an impossibility to operate three ships. They broke up the ship of least draught burning it <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>sea,</b> after having distributed to the others two its sails, anchors, and cables.|$|R

5|$|Two days later, the Coast Guard cutter Chase took over, escorting the KD II to San Diego. Along {{the way the}} {{investigation}} continued. The Coast Guard reported that the four-man crew was cooperative with {{the investigation}}, largely sitting back and watching television in the lounge. Since they claimed not to have finned the sharks themselves, they believed they had not done anything wrong. Ship's records revealed that the KD II had met fishing vessels, primarily Korean longline fishing boats, at prearranged locations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>seas</b> near the Fiji and Solomon Islands and bought fins from them {{for a total of}} $250,000. On an earlier voyage that summer, the ship had made $6 million from shark fins obtained the same way. Korean-language records from a broker on board indicated an ongoing operation, giving the names of other ships involved. The refrigeration unit on board had broken before the ship had left Honolulu, and the fins were out on deck in an attempt to dry them out and reduce the odor.|$|E

50|$|L. Ron Hubbard, {{founder of}} the Church of Scientology, engaged in a similar practice, for similar reasons (namely, avoid {{established}} governmental authority). An entire branch of the organization, including Hubbard himself and his executive leadership, became a maritime based community named the Sea Organization (Sea Org). Beginning in 1967 with a complement of four ships the Sea Org spent most of its existence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>sea,</b> visiting ports {{around the world for}} refueling and resupply. In 1975 much of these operations were shifted to land based locations around the world, especially in the USA (e.g. Clearwater, FL) and the UK (Saint Hill Manor).|$|R
5000|$|To retaliate, the Song dynasty of China mustered a huge {{invasion}} force, with a naval arm {{to provide}} support to land operations. They were already fearful of Vietnam's reputation at sea combat, thus a large enough force was organised so as to [...] "not lose even if they can't score a win".

5|$|The {{comparatively}} {{warm and}} sunny climate allows {{species of plants}} to thrive which do not <b>on</b> <b>the</b> mainland.

Portland sea lavender can be found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>sea</b> cliffs—unique to Portland {{it is one of the}} United Kingdom's rarest plants. The wild flowers and plants make an excellent habitat for butterflies; over half of the British Isles' 57 butterfly species can be seen on Portland, including varieties that migrate from mainland Europe. Species live on Portland that are rare in the United Kingdom, including the limestone race of the silver-studded blue.|$|R

25|$|In United States v. Jackalow (1861), the Court {{held that}} Article Three venue must be {{established}} by facts found by a jury. The act of piratical murder by Jackalow was alleged to have occurred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>seas,</b> between the waters within {{the jurisdiction of the}} states of New York and Connecticut; New Jersey was the first state into which Jackalow was brought upon capture. An 1820 anti-piracy statute provided that, if the crime occurred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>seas,</b> venue was proper in the first state into which the defendant was brought after capture. The Court held that—although the boundary of New York and Connecticut state waters were a question of law for the judge—the location of the crime was a question of fact for the jury. Thus, Jackalow was granted a new trial.|$|E

25|$|Decatur came to {{love the}} sea and sailing in a {{roundabout}} manner. When Stephen was eight years old, he developed a severe case of whooping cough.
