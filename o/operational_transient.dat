40|$|BACKGROUND JAFNPP design {{criteria}} (Ref. 1) requires. and SLs ensure, that specified acceptable fuel design limits are not exceeded during steady state operation. normal <b>operational</b> <b>transients,</b> and abnormal <b>operational</b> <b>transients.</b> The fuel cladding integrity SL is set such that no significant fuel damage is calculated to occur if the limit is not violated. Because fuel damage {{is not directly}} observable, a stepback approach is used to establish an SL. such that the MCPR {{is not less than}} the limit specified in Specification 2. 1. 1. 2. MCPR greater than the specified limit represents a conservative margin relative to the conditions required to maintain fuel cladding integrity. The fuel cladding is one of the physical barriers that separate the radioactive materials from the environs. The integrity of this cladding barrier is related to its relative freedom from perforations or cracking. Although some corrosion or use related cracking may occur during the life of the cladding, fission product migration from this source is incrementally cumulative and continuously measurable. Fuel cladding perforations, however, can result from thermal stresses, which occur from reactor operation significantly above design conditions. While fission product migration from cladding perforation is just as measurable as that from use related cracking, the thermally caused cladding perforations signal a threshold beyond which still greater thermal stresses may cause gross, rather than incremental, cladding deterioration. Therefore, the fuel cladding SL is defined with a margin to the conditions that would produce onset of transition boiling (i. e [...] MCPR = 1. 00). These conditions represent a significant departure from the condition intended by design for planned operation. The MCPR fuel cladding integrity SL ensures that during normal operation and during abnormal <b>operational</b> <b>transients,</b> at least 99. 9 % of the fuel rods in the core do not experience transition boiling...|$|R
40|$|In this work, the Petri-net {{modelling}} approach {{applied to}} the control system design of the Advanced Lead Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED) is presented, paying {{particular attention to the}} startup procedure. The reactor startup is the <b>operational</b> <b>transient</b> in which all the systems of the plant are brought from the cold shutdown condition to the full power mode, close to load-frequency control. In this phase, the several control actions to be taken need to be properly coordinated. To this end, the operational sequence which constitutes the reactor startup procedure has been described by adopting the Petri-nets approach, i. e., a useful formalism for the modelling and the analysis of Discrete Event Systems. Thanks to this quantitative representation, it is possible to easily derive the corresponding control scheme. In addition, the Petri-nets approach has been also exploited for the two-level control system architecture, namely a master system coordinates the operation of the plant by sending suitable signals to the slave system, in which feedback controllers are implemented. As a major outcome of this work, the procedure for the reactor startup and the transition to the full power mode has been simulated in order to assess the control system performance...|$|E

40|$|Ongoing {{research}} on innovative and environmentally sustainable systems for energy production, {{as an alternative}} to the traditional sources, led ENEA to investigate high temperature heat generation by solar power and the subsequent energy collection and storage. An experimental facility, the Prova Collettori Solari (PCS), was built at the ENEA Casaccia Research Centre to test the most innovative components before industrialization and to determine the effectiveness of the foreseen thermodynamic cycle utilizing a molten salt mixture, heated in a solar collector irradiated by parabolic mirrors. In parallel with the experimental investigation, the development of a numerical tool for thermal-fluid-dynamic simulation of circuits, with such a mixture as the primary heat transfer fluid, was pursued and the RELAP 5 code was modified accordingly. Thermo-physical property tables were developed for the liquid and steam phases of the molten salt mixture and inserted into the RELAP 5 code. The modified code was benchmarked versus experimental data. The entire PCS facility was then simulated with various <b>operational</b> <b>transients</b> aimed at studying both the dynamic and thermal behavior of the whole system.

The THDC are developed for the normal operations, <b>operational</b> <b>transients,</b> and design-basis accidents. The requirements of the safety analyses are incorporated into the design criteria, consistent with the integrated safety management and the safety-by-design philosophy implemented throughout the APT design process. The phenomenology limiting the thermal-hydraulic design and the confidence level requirements for each limit are discussed. The overall philosophy of the uncertainty analyses and the confidence level requirements also are presented. Different sets of criteria are developed for normal operations, <b>operational</b> <b>transients,</b> anticipated accidents, unlikely accidents, extremely unlikely accidents, and accidents during TNS replacement. In general, the philosophy {{is to use the}} strictest criteria for the high-frequency events. The criteria is relaxed as the event frequencies become smaller. The THDC must be considered as a guide for the design philosophy and not as a hard limit. When achievable, design margins greater than those required by the THDC must be used.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} issues {{in the study of}} the power generation and distribution is the characterization of the grid behavior, whether a relevant fraction of the connected power plants relies on Renewable Energy Sources. Indeed, because of the discontinuous power supply and the limited presence of energy accumulators, concerning power imbalances may take place on the grid. The power plants ensuring high reliability performance should be ready to feed the loads when the Renewable Energy Sources are not available. In order to ensure the grid stability and the sustainability of nuclear energy, the possibility of operating Generation-IV nuclear reactors in a flexible way should be considered, i. e., the Nuclear Power Plants should adjust the mechanical power produced so as to comply with the sudden grid frequency variations. In the present work, this opportunity is assessed for the Lead-cooled Fast Reactors, adopting the Advanced Lead Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED) as a representative of Lead-cooled Fast Reactor technology. For this reactor concept, because of the large thermal inertia that characterizes the system, the adoption of the ‘‘reactor-follows-turbine’’ scheme (currently employed in the Pressurized Water Reactors) is not feasible. An alternative solution is proposed, i. e., the set-point for the thermal power produced in the core is kept constant at the nominal value (or slowly variable), and the set-point for the mechanical power available to the alternator is adjusted according to the load demands. In order to assess the performance of the developed control scheme, two case studies are simulated. In the first one, a frequency profile of the synchronous Continental European grid is provided. In the second simulation, the possibility of performing the islanding <b>operational</b> <b>transient</b> is evaluated. Such an <b>operational</b> <b>transient</b> needs the connected power plants to perform relevant power variations in few seconds in order to deal with the abrupt change in the grid powered configuration. The simulation outcomes show that the proposed control scheme allows achieving prompt mechanical power variations. As for the quantitative results, in both simulations the frequency value is maintained below the upper safety threshold (50. 8 Hz). On the other hand, the control scheme complies with the technological constraints set for the safe operation of the primary circuit of the ALFRED reactor. In particular, the Balance of Plant pressure-induced feedbacks on the primary circuit dynamics are effectively dampened, i. e., the temperature in the cold leg is effectively maintained close to its set-point (i. e., 400 °C) and the plant is almost insensitive to the variations of the grid power demands...|$|E

40|$|This work {{proposes to}} use the pseudo-harmonics {{technique}} as a modal method in spatial kinetics. The pseudo-harmonics are the eigenfunctions associated with the leakage + removal operators in the multigroup steady-state diffusion equation. In this work, the pseudo-harmonics are obtained from the diffusion equation discretized with the Coarse Mesh Finite Difference Method (CMFD) coupled to the Nodal Expansion Method (NEM). Modal methods approximate the time-dependent flux by expanding it in predetermined functions which represent the space dependence, so that the unknowns are the expansion coefficients, which carry all time dependence of the problem. To obtain the system of equations whose solutions are the modal expansion coefficients, use is made of a weighting function procedure. This process leads to a linear system of ordinary differential equations whose dimension equals the number of pseudo-harmonics employed. The solution of these equations is obtained through analytical integration of the delayed neutrons precursor equations, while the time dependence of the neutrons flux is treated by the Rosenbrock Generalized Runge-Kutta method with automatic time step size control. A direct method was developed from the spatial kinetics equations discretized by CMFD coupled to NEM in order to compare the methods.

40|$|Excessive oxidation, hydriding, and {{extensive}} irradiation damage occur in high-burnup fuel cladding, and as result, mechanical properties of high-burnup fuels are degraded significantly. This {{may influence the}} current fuel cladding failure limits for loss-of- coolant-accident (LOCA) situations, {{which are based on}} fuel cladding behavior for zero burnup. To avoid cladding fragmentation and fuel dispersal during a LOCA, 10 CFR 50. 46 requires that peak cladding temperature shall not exceed 1204 degrees C (2200 degrees F) and that total oxidation of the fuel cladding nowhere exceeds 0. 17 times total cladding thickness before oxidation. Because of the concern, a new experimental program to investigate high-burnup fuel cladding behavior under LOCA situations has been initiated under the sponsorship of the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A hot-cell test plan to investigate single-rod behavior under simulated LOCA conditions is described in this paper. In the meantime, industry fuel design and operating conditions are expected to undergo further changes as more advanced cladding materials are developed. Under these circumstances, mechanical properties of high-burnup fuel cladding require further investigation so that results from studies on LOCA, reactivity- initiated-accident (RIA), <b>operational</b> <b>transient,</b> and power-ramping situations, can be extrapolated to modified or advanced cladding materials and altered irradiation conditions without repeating major integral experiments in test reactors.

40|$|The recent {{interest}} in the Small Modular Reactors for their potential increased economic competitiveness has focused attention in part on reducing operational costs to offset those plant costs that do not benefit from the economies of scale of large traditional units. Plant economics is significantly driven by plant availability, which can be enhanced by means of innovative operating strategies that act to avert plant or unit trips. A strategy that involves fast runback of the power plant to avert a turbine trip following a disconnection from the grid has been developed and assessed for a typical sodium-cooled SMR (adopted for proof-of-principle demonstration). A classic control approach based on PID feedback controllers has been adopted for establishing a baseline for performance improvement. Simulations outcomes have shown that although the reactor power level can be appropriately reduced, {{the net result is}} a global cooling of the system circuits. Such system conditions do not facilitate the objective of a rapid reconnect to the grid once the issue has been resolved. Moreover, the classic approach requires relatively large control rod motion. An alternative MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) control scheme on the other hand provides additional regulation flexibility by allowing for coordinated control actions on the mass flow rates and on the control rods. A Model-based Predictive Control implementation of the MIMO approach has ensured prompt power level reduction with reduced overcooling and control rod motion, facilitating a quicker reconnect to the grid. Such flexibility could lead to improved system availability.

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{gives an}} account of the {{development}} and validation of an up-to-date coupled neutronic/thermal-hydraulic model for the Swedish Forsmark boiling water reactor. The model will be used for analyses of the consequences of the planned power uprate from 2928 MWth to 3253 MWth. At first, the development of the PARCS and RELAP 5 models are presented. On the neutronic side, cross-sections data was generated, allowing feeding PARCS with realistic data. This step was performed by converting the library data file from the power plant using the in-house cross-section interface code. The dependence of the material properties on history effects, burnup, and instantaneous conditions was accounted for, and the full heterogeneity of the core was thus taken into account. Each of the 676 fuel assemblies was modeled individually, while the 161 control rods were grouped into 6 different types. On the thermal-hydraulic side, the model consists of a model for the feedwater system, a model for the reactor vessel that include a model for the core channels, and a model {{for each of the four}} steam lines. The fuel assemblies were modeled as twelve flow channels in the core region. The coupling between the two codes is touched upon, with emphasis on the mapping between the hydrodynamic/heat structures and the neutronic nodes. The validation efforts were focusing on benchmarking the code capabilities against measured plant data, both under steady-state and transient conditions. The PARCS standalone model was validated against traversing in-core probe (TIP) measurements, taken at different burnup level with operating power varies from 108 % (nominal level) to 120 % (uprated level). The coupled PARCS/RELAP 5 model was validated against an <b>operational</b> <b>transient.</b> For this validation task, the transient chosen was a turbine trip test, which was performed on May 6, 2013. Comparisons between calculated and measured parameters demonstrate that the coupled model was able to correctly represent the steady-state conditions of the plant. The validation of the coupled model against measured transient plant data was then performed. It has been demonstrated that the coupled model is able to capture the main features of the transient with a sufficient level of accurac...|$|E

The analysis of the Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBVVR) is carried out through the use of the reactor analysis code RAMONA- 4 B in a scenario of an <b>operational</b> <b>transient,</b> a turbine trip with failure of all the bypass valves. This study is divided in three parts. As an introduction, {{a brief description of the}} code RAMONA- 4 B. Later, the implemented SBWR model, based on the General Electric Standard Safety Analysis Report (SSAR), is described and discussed. Finally, the reactor behavior during a turbine trip transient is numerically simulated through the description of nuclear and thermal hydraulic parameters and under the scenario conditions suggested by General Electric. The SBWR model consists of the representation of the vessel internal components through parameters such as areas, diameters and volumes, and the one-quarter-core neutron parameters which were obtained using the transport theory lattice physics code CASMO- 3. The thermohydraulic equations are solved by RAMONA- 4 B in a closed-contour inside the vessel and in a hundred eighty four parallel channels (including bypass) in the core. The tridimensional representation of the reactor core is accomplished through a proposed fuel load which was obtained from a selection of out of three fuel loads and using some standard fuel design parameters. The cross sections are represented using a polynomial as a function of the bumup, void fraction, fuel and moderator temperatures. The six-group delayed neutron equation and the one-and-a-half neutron diffusion equation are solved and the power distribution in the reactor core is obtained. Also, RAMONA- 4 B has implemented a (adiabatic) steam line model to represent the acoustic effects of the turbine stop valve closure during the transient. Finally, the two-phase coolant and neutronic parameters are calculated in steady state and during the turbine trip transient. The results are discussed and compared against the ones shown in the chapter XV of the SSAR...|$|E
40|$|Validation is {{the process}} of {{determining}} whether the models in a computer code can describe the important phenomena in applications of interest. This report describes past work and proposed future work for validating the Gas Plant Analyzer and System Simulator (G-PASS) code. The G-PASS code was developed for simulating gas reactor and chemical plant system behavior during <b>operational</b> <b>transients</b> and upset events. Results are presented comparing code properties, individual component models, and integrated system behavior against results from four other computer codes. Also identified are two experiment facilities nearing completion that will provide additional data for individual component and integrated system model validation. The main goal of the validation exercise is to ready a version of G-PASS for use as a tool in evaluating vendor designs and providing guidance to vendors on design directions in nuclear-hydrogen applications...|$|R

A RELAP 5 /MOD 3. 2 nodalization model of a VVER- 1 OOO (V- 320) nuclear power plant was updated, improved and validated against available experimental data. The data included integrated test results obtained from actual power plant testing. The steady state and the <b>operational</b> <b>transients</b> test data describe the behavior of the Unit 5 of Kozloduy NPP (Bulgaria). The <b>operational</b> <b>transients</b> consisted of a loss of flow caused by the successive trip of two main coolant pumps without reactor scram. A validation process of the developed model has been performed in two stages comprising an initial and a transient validation. The comparison between experimental data and calculation results proved the adequacy of the model and also the code capacity to reproduce main plant parameter evolutions. The plant model was also used for a preliminary analysis of a large break loss of coolant accident (LB LOCA) which is the design basis accident (DBA) for the VVER- 1000 plants. Due to the limitations of the utilized code version (unavailability of the redwood model), only the first stage (blowdown) of the accident was investigated. The results have been compared with similar calculations obtained by the Russian specialists with an indigenous thermal-hydraulic code (TECH-M). The comparison showed a good agreement. For the most important calculated parameter (hot spot cladding temperature) an uncertainty analysis using the response surface method was performed. The nodalization model seems to be adequate for the class of transients and accidents investigated, but the inclusion of the reactor specific point kinetics parameters, emergency headwater system model and updating some of the component parameters (e. g. main coolant pump friction) will increase its area of applicability...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMonitoring the {{condition}} of a component is typically based on an empirical model that estimates the values of some measurable variables (signals) in normal conditions and triggers the fault alarm when the reconstruction deviates from the measured signal. When condition monitoring is performed during plant <b>operational</b> <b>transients</b> the intrinsically dynamic behavior of the signals {{should be taken into}} account. To this purpose, two approaches are proposed in this work. The former is based on the development of several reconstruction models, each one dedicated to a different operational zone of the component. The latter is based on the preprocessing of the signals by means of Haar wavelet transforms. The performance of the two proposed approaches are compared to that of the traditional reconstruction approach used for stationary conditions, with respect to a case study concerning {{the condition}} monitoring of a gas turbine during start-up transients...|$|R
