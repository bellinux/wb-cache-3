5000|$|BRAVE LION was {{extensively}} {{studied by}} both the military and civilian defence establishments. In the summer of 1982 the then Secret Land Force Operational Effectiveness Study conducted by Mobile Command {{under the direction of}} General Bezile sharply criticized the entire concept of sending a Canadian Brigade to Norway. It concluded in part that the CAST Brigade group [...] "suffers important shortfalls in manning, <b>operational</b> <b>stocks</b> and war resources" [...] and further that [...] "there were no comprehensive plans for assembly, deployment and reception". Although couched in technical language, the report made it abundantly clear that Canada had been publicly proclaiming a commitment to an operational task that it had little capacity to fulfill. [...] General Gérard Thériault, a major proponent of forces integration and the then-current Chief of the Defence Staff, stated that Canadian defence policy would be well served by consolidating their commitments in Europe. Thériault's replacement, General Paul Manson, started a review that suggested a number of changes to the CAST organization, but these were eventually ignored.|$|E
40|$|Joint <b>Operational</b> <b>Stocks</b> (JOS) {{are used}} as a "revolving" {{inventory}} of end-use items available for loans to United States Special Operations Forces. The JOS items are administered by the United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) in Tampa, FL. By using a revolving inventory, USSOCOM reduces the total quantities of items {{that need to be}} stocked However, current stocks are inadequate to meet demand, and current funding is inadequate to fully stock all inventory items. Currently USSOCOM has no methodology to prioritize purchase decisions to provide the best support to Special Operations Forces, per dollar spent. This thesis provides a methodology to allocate limited financial resources in procuring additional JOS units of inventory to provide the greatest increase in mission support benefit to special operations forces. The methodology is applied to the current JOS inventory system, providing a recommended prioritized sequence of inventory purchases. This thesis is limited to those items in the JOS inventory that currently do not have adequate quantities to meet the current demand, yet have sufficient demand history to provide adequate data for analysis. The methodology developed, however, is generic in nature and can be applied again in the future as more data becomes available. U. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|E
50|$|Electronic {{multi-function}} fuzes {{started to}} appear around 1980.

40|$|Application of {{the robots}} in {{industrial}} production processes, {{year after year}} is increased. The constant growth of the robot application is related for its functional justification. There are plenty reasons for it as operator’s protection in bad working conditions and environments or operator’s protection by hard works, time saving, higher quality, higher productivities, cost saving etc. Industrial robots are applied in all branches of the industries. Their use is still {{the largest in the}} manufacturing of motor vehicles industry but other industry branches record increase of industrial robot implementation. Information technology development has a big influence on changes in robotics that lead to the new functional solutions and the robot capabilities.

50|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>operational</b> <b>stock</b> for the Central Line, two trains of privately owned stock have been based at the depot. Cravens Heritage Trains bought a 3-car train of 1960 stock, and this was stabled at Hainault following its use as the final train on the Epping to Ongar branch. Maintenance work on it was undertaken at the depot, {{and a series of}} rail tours were run on the eastern end of the Central Line during 1995 and 1996. It was moved to Ruislip depot, when the Central Line signalling was upgraded for Automatic Train Protection and Automatic Train Operation, which meant that the preserved unit could no longer operate on the Central Line, as it was not compatible with the new system. Cravens Heritage Trains also own a 4-car unit of 1962 stock, which remains at the depot, where it is being restored.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. The Joint <b>Operational</b> <b>Stock</b> (JOS) is a centrally-located inventory of Special-Operations- peculiar weapons and equipment, {{managed by the}} United States Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). New procurement of JOS weapons and equipment is currently planned by manually prioritizing the item-wise shortfalls experienced in the JOS inventory during the previous year. This method has not always provided convincing justification for finding, {{as indicated by the}} loss of such finding in fiscal year 1999. Also, new technology and other items not historically demanded must be handled in an ad-hoc fashion. We introduce a procurement planning tool that seeks to maximize the ability to completely loadout special operations missions by coordinating year-by-year procurement of individual items. Rather than focus just on history, we concentrate on supporting future missions over an entire multi-year planning horizon. The plans are quickly suggested by a simple greedy myopic heuristic that we show to produce almost-optimal advice[URL] Unitea States Nav...|$|R
