5|$|Square Enix {{has stated}} that the trade of items for real {{currency}} is officially a violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Terms</b> of Service for Final Fantasy XI. In early 2006, Square Enix discovered {{that a group of}} players had found a way to generate game currency and exchange it for real currency, which, in turn, drove up prices for all items across the game. In response, 700 accounts were permanently banned and 300billion gil was removed from circulation. In July 2006, Square Enix banned or suspended over 8,000 other accounts for similar manipulation and commerce. Since 2006, Square Enix has regularly banned accounts found to be in violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms,</b> some of them using third-party tools, effectively removing billions of gil from the in-game economy.|$|E

5|$|After {{defeat in}} World War I, Germany was plunged into bankruptcy, social injustice, poverty, crime and mass unemployment. During these {{depressing}} years, Germany saw {{the creation of}} a number of extremist political and paramilitary associations, representing both the far-left and the far-right. Amidst this crisis, Schaub decided to join the National Socialist German Workers Party, later commonly known as the Nazi Party; he became member #81. The political program of the party was essentially a rejection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of the Treaty of Versailles, antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism, driven by Adolf Hitler and his world view.|$|E

Using large {{electronic}} databases, it is shown that <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> in leading Anglophone academic journals was rare {{up to the}} 1940 s. Citations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> were generally disapproving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> racist or imperialist ideologies with which it was associated. Neither Herbert Spencer nor William Graham Sumner were described as Social Darwinists in this early literature. Talcott Parsons (1932, 1934, 1937) extended <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>term</b> to describe any extensive use of ideas from biology in the social sciences.

5|$|By {{the time}} of the {{armistice}} on 22 June, approximately 1.8million French soldiers were in captivity; a figure representing roughly 10 percent of the total adult male population of France at the time. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of the Compiègne Armistice was that French prisoners would remain in German custody {{until the end of the}} war which was thought to be imminent. French prisoners came from all backgrounds, regions and civilian occupations within France and also included a substantial number of soldiers from the French colonial empire. Nevertheless, approximately a third of all French prisoners of war were French farmers or peasants and, in some regions, the total proportion of agricultural workers captured was much higher. This created labour shortages in many civilian occupations, particularly agriculture which was largely unmechanised.|$|E

After the end of the war, she went into the Black Sea to assist in the enforcement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of the Armistice with Germany.

The party platform included removal of the Weimar Republic in Germany, rejection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of the Treaty of Versailles, radical antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism. They promised a strong central government, increased Lebensraum (living space) for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews, who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.|$|E

5|$|For {{various reasons}} it was {{impossible}} to apply some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of the Act. Less eligibility was in some cases impossible without starving paupers and the high cost of building workhouses incurred by rate payers meant that outdoor relief continued to be a popular alternative. Despite efforts to ban outdoor relief, parishes continued to offer it as a more cost-effective method of dealing with pauperism. The Outdoor Labour Test Order and Outdoor Relief Prohibitory Order were both issued to try to prevent people receiving relief outside of the workhouse.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, U.S. President John Tyler, unaligned {{with any}} {{political}} party, decided independently {{to pursue the}} annexation of Texas {{in a bid to}} gain a base of popular support for another four years in office. His official motivation was to outmaneuver suspected diplomatic efforts by the British government for emancipation of slaves in Texas, which would undermine slavery in the United States. Through secret negotiations with the Houston administration, Tyler secured a treaty of annexation in April 1844. When the documents were submitted to the US Senate for ratification, the details <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of annexation became public and the question of acquiring Texas took center stage in the presidential election of 1844.|$|E
5|$|In 1851, a {{new state}} {{constitution}} was created and ratified. Among the constitution's new clauses was an extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of representatives to two years and senators to four years. It also made many of the previously appointed positions open to public election. The new constitution delegated many minor tasks to newly created elected offices. With its workload considerably decreased, instead of meeting annually, the General Assembly only convened a session every two years. The new constitution also placed new limits on the General Assembly's power to create local laws, the General Assembly having become notorious for creating state level laws that were only applied to one town or county.|$|E

His murderer was a man called Neradets, who put a sword through Yaropolk before fleeing to hide with Riurik in Peremyshl; the date given is November 22, 1087. His body was taken to Kiev and buried in the church of St Peter, the church which Yaropolk himself had endowed.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} years, {{many of the}} proprietors {{pulled out of the}} real estate market and voluntarily sold their property to the government so that sale to the land's occupiers could be facilitated.

The agreement to join the Confederation contained a clause outlining the possibility that the federal government of Canada could provide a grant of up to CA$800,000 to the provincial government to facilitate the purchase of the land from the proprietors. In 1875, through 'The Commissioners Appointed Under The Provisions of The Land Purchase Act, 1875' all of the outstanding proprietor-owned land was compulsorily purchased by the provincial government, at rates decided by a 'Commission of Enquiry'.|$|E

5|$|Phips, whose motives {{continue}} to be debated by historians today, claimed this was a violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of capitulation, and consequently declared the agreement void.

He had the fortifications destroyed, removing all of their weaponry. Before he left, he convinced a number of Acadians to swear oaths of allegiance to the English crown, appointed a council of locals to administer the town, and then sailed back to Boston, carrying Meneval and his garrison as prisoners of war. Phips received a hero's welcome and was lavished with praise, although he was criticized in some circles (and has been vilified in French and Acadian histories) for allowing the sacking of Port Royal.|$|E
