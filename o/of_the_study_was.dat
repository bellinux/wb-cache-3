5|$|Between 1965 and 1967, the Federal Water Pollution Control Administration, the United States Bureau of Mines, the United States Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, the United States Geological Survey, and the Pennsylvania Department of Mines and Mineral Industries {{conducted}} a joint {{study on the}} watershed of Black Creek. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to deal with water pollution due to acid mine drainage. Geological field work {{was carried out in}} the area between October 1965 and December 1965. Core and rock cuttings were done between October 1966 and June 1967. However, this study was ended before all of the necessary scientific investigations were completed.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{conclusions}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> {{that the people}} buried in Lindow Moss {{may have had a}} less varied diet than their European counterparts. According to Jody Joy, curator of the Iron Age collection at the British Museum, the importance of Lindow Man lies more in how he lived rather than how he died, as the circumstances surrounding his demise may never be fully established.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay {{corridor}} was one {{of twelve}} Queens bus corridors studied under the city's bus rapid transit (BRT) study, which was meant to determine the feasibility of having dedicated lanes and rebuilt stops to speed up service on BRT corridors. Beginning on January 4, 2008, the New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) conducted an 18-month study on Woodhaven Boulevard {{as part of the}} city's Congested Corridors Project to improve congested and dangerous roadways. One of the short-term recommendations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to implement bus rapid transit along the corridor. In June 2010, the Woodhaven-Cross Bay corridor was added to the list of potential corridors for Phase II of Select Bus Service (SBS), the MTA's brand of BRT service.|$|E

25|$|The {{long-term}} PIMS study, {{started in}} the 1960s and lasting for 19 years, attempted to understand the Profit Impact of Marketing Strategies (PIMS), particularly the effect of market share. The initial conclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> unambiguous: the greater a company's market share, the greater their rate of profit. Market share provides economies of scale. It also provides experience curve advantages. The combined effect is increased profits.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, Merck {{commenced}} the APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp PRevention On Vioxx) study, {{a three-year}} trial {{with the primary}} aim of evaluating the efficacy of rofecoxib for the prophylaxis of colorectal polyps.

25|$|The {{first phase}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> {{designed}} mainly by Christopher Gillberg and Peder Rasmussen. Initially, preschool teachers {{in all areas}} of Gothenburg were asked to answer a questionnaire with a series of yes and no questions to identify children that possibly had MBD. (The questionnaire was based on an earlier pilot study.) The researchers used a purely operational (symptom-based) definition of MBD that had been devised especially for the study and was later termed DAMP.|$|E

SAIS received the most votes, followed by Georgetown University (Walsh), Harvard University (Kennedy), Tufts University (Fletcher), and Columbia University (SIPA).

25|$|Rwanda housing {{authority}} (RHA) has recently completed the land control {{study and the}} elaboration of the town planning development project of the shores of lake Muhazi. The main objective <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to identify the sectors of the northern and eastern shores of lake Muhazi which are subjected to land pressure so as to establish protection belts and safeguard them. Within this context the study furthermore aimed at establishing a town planning master plan to ensure better organisation of the site’s space and a rational and sustainable occupation of the shores of lake Muhazi.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, Oscar {{and other}} leaders of the Marulu Project {{approached}} the George Institute for Global Health (The George) regarding the possibility of conducting {{a study on the}} prevalence of FASD in Fitzroy Valley. The George had previously developed Yajilarra (2009), a documentary film on Oscar’s group of Aboriginal women’s campaign to limit alcohol consumption in Fitzroy Valley, and was considered a suitable organisation to provide medical research services to the project. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to discover how many children were affected by FASD, attract funding and resources to provide care for the children affected, and prevent the disorder from occurring.|$|E

25|$|Documents {{were found}} in Shanghai that showed details of how the Japanese Army went about opening comfort {{stations}} for Japanese troops in occupied Shanghai. Documents included the Tianjin Municipal Archives from the archival files of the Japanese government and the Japanese police during the periods of the occupation in World War II. Municipal archives from Shanghai and Nanjing were also examined. One conclusion reached was that the relevant archives in Korea are distorted. A conclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> that the Japanese Imperial government, and the colonial government in Korea, tried to avoid recording the illegal mobilization of comfort women. It was concluded that they burned most of the records immediately before the surrender; but, the study confirmed that some documents and records survived.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1998, Healey & Baker's Development Team, which is now owned by Cushman & Wakefield, were {{appointed}} by Liverpool City Council to conduct a retail study of the Liverpool City Centre for the replacement Unitary Development Plan. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> to enable the Council to identify ways of protecting and improving the City Centre and also {{to find out why}} the City Centre was perceived as unattractive to new high quality retailers. Cushman & Wakefield's study revealed that Liverpool's reputation as a regional shopping centre was under serious threat, but the study underlined that a feasible scheme and redevelopment site existed within the heart of the city.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, {{under the}} Phase II of the city's Select Bus Service (SBS) program, faster bus service to LaGuardia Airport was {{recommended}} {{as a primary}} need. Under the LaGuardia Airport Access Alternatives Analysis study, another SBS study which was conducted by NYCDOT in partnership with MTA Bus, New York City Transit, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in 2011-2012, it was recommended that a bus route should connect the central terminals of LaGuardia and transit hubs in Jackson Heights and Woodside. At these transit hubs, transfers {{could be made to}} the subway, Long Island Rail Road and buses from the new connector route. The reason for the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> the slow bus service on the , and Q72, which all went to LaGuardia Airport.|$|E
