25|$|While {{the vast}} {{majority}} of the ship's multinational personnel held positions that did not require a seaman's qualifications (as they handled services like laundry, cooking, entertainment, cleaning, minding children, and waiting tables), according to a senior shipping official, they had received mandatory training in basic safety to be able to help in situations like this. Although all <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>spoke</b> at least basic English, most spoke no Italian.|$|E
25|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the second}} season, he was shot, which {{affected}} his control of his right-hand. His temporary fix to this possibly long-term problem was to work together with Cristina during every one of his surgeries so that she could take over in case he might have trouble with his hand. The arrangement fell apart after Cristina, reacting to growing stress after George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) caught onto their secret, went to the Chief and confessed everything. Initially, he was engaged in a cold war with Cristina, where neither <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>spoke.</b> However, after she broke the silence, he proposed to her and she accepted his proposal. Before their secret was revealed, Burke was to become the next Chief of Surgery, but he had to compete with his fellow attendings for the position. He has since recovered from the injury, after Derek operated on him. For the remainder of the season, Preston and Cristina prepared for the wedding and experienced normal stresses that result from such a process, such as meeting each other's parents.|$|E
500|$|Recruitment {{was carried}} out by a former French paratrooper, Roger Bruni, {{operating}} from an apartment on Rue Bachaumont in central Paris. Advertisements, placed in newspapers such as France Soir, offered [...] "a job with a future abroad ... minimum age 22, former non-commissioned officers preferred". The body of men eventually assembled varied widely in terms of age, background and experience, but was based largely around ex-paratroopers and former Foreign Legionnaires. The average age was about 25. French-speaking veterans of an assortment of African and Middle Eastern conflicts spanning the previous two decades successfully applied, but past service did not prove a necessity; some of the men accepted had no military experience. Most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>spoke</b> English only at a basic level if at all.|$|E

500|$|Joe Namath, Roy Firestone, and Mike Judge guest {{starred in}} the episode. Scully claims that Judge was paid $1,000,000 {{to appear in the}} episode, where he voiced the cameo of Hank Hill. The {{appearance}} was actually a cross-promotion for Judge's animated show King of the Hill which followed The Simpsons on Fox's Sunday schedule in 1997. Other King of the Hill characters (Hank's niece Luanne, Hank's wife Peggy, Hank's son Bobby, and Hank's friends, Dale Gribble, Bill Dauterive, and Boomhauer) were present in the scene, although none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>spoke.</b> Marv Albert was originally going to play Firestone's part as a sports radio host, but was dropped following sexual assault charges that were made against him around the time the episode was in pre-production. Albert would later appear, however, in the season 20 episode [...] "The Burns and The Bees".|$|E
500|$|From {{there she}} was taken west by Peter Fraser (a page of Lord Lovat) and his men through Perthshire. At Balquhidder, {{according}} to MacGregor tradition, she was entertained in the great hall, provided with a meal of venison, and slept on a heather bed covered with deerskins. [...] The existence of St Fillan's Pool on the River Fillan near Tyndrum would have provided useful cover for her captors: it was regularly used as a cure for insanity, which would have helped to explain her presence to the curious. The details of the onward route from there are not clear but it is likely she was taken through Glen Coe to Loch Ness and then through Glen Garry to Loch Hourn on the west coast. After a short delay she was then put on board ship to the Monach Isles. The difficulty of her position must have quickly become evident. She was {{in the company of}} men whose loyalty was to clan chieftains rather than the law, and few <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>spoke</b> any English at all. [...] Their native Gaelic would have been incomprehensible to her, although as her years of captivity wore on she slowly learned something of the language. She complained that young members of the local aristocracy visited her as she waited by the shores of Loch Hourn, but that [...] "they came with design to see me, but not to relieve me".|$|E
500|$|In June 1840, Mary Shelley, Percy Florence (her one {{surviving}} child), {{and a few}} of his friends—George Defell, Julian Robinson, and Robert Leslie Ellis—began their European tour. They travelled to Paris {{and then}} to Metz. From there, they went down the Moselle by boat to Coblenz and then up the Rhine to Mainz, Frankfurt, Heidelberg, Baden-Baden, Freiburg, Schaffhausen, Zürich, the Splügen, and Chiavenna. Feeling ill, Shelley rested at a spa in Baden-Baden; she had wracking pains in her head and [...] "convulsive shudders", symptoms of the meningioma that would eventually kill her. This stop dismayed Percy Florence and his friends, as it provided no entertainment for them; moreover, since none <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>spoke</b> German, the group was forced to remain together. After crossing Switzerland by carriage and railway, the group spent two months at Lake Como, where Mary relaxed and reminisced about how she and Percy had almost rented a villa with Lord Byron at the lake one summer. The group then travelled on to Milan, and from there, Percy Florence and his friends soon left for Cambridge to take their university finals. Mary Shelley remained, waiting for funds to complete her journey. In September, she returned to England via Geneva and Paris. Upon her return, she became depressed and could not write: [...] " [...] I might live – as once I lived—hoping—loving—aspiring enjoying... I am placid now, & the days go by – I am happy in Percy [...] society & health – but no adjuncts... gild the quiet hours & dulness [...] creeps over my intellect". Despite this lethargy she managed to publish a second edition of Percy Shelley's prose and began working on another edition of his poetry.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the {{knowledge}} of foreign languages, Slovenia ranks among the top European countries. The most taught foreign languages are English, German, Italian, French and Spanish. , 92% of the population between the age of 25 and 64 spoke at least one foreign language and around 71.8% <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>spoke</b> at least two foreign languages, which was the highest percentage in the European Union.

2500|$|The {{ancestors}} of Pennsylvania German speakers came from {{various parts of}} the southwest corner of the German-speaking region of Europe, mainly the Palatinate, but also including the Electorate of the Palatinate [...] (German Kurpfalz), the Duchy of Baden, Swabia, Württemberg, Alsace (German Elsass), German Lorraine, and Switzerland. Most <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>spoke</b> Rhine Franconian, especially Palatinan and to a lesser degree Alemannic dialects, and it is believed that in the first generations after the settlers arrived these dialects merged. The result of that dialect levelling was a dialect very close to the eastern dialects of Palatinian, especially the rural dialects around Mannheim/Ludwigshafen.|$|E
2500|$|In Corfu, two villages on {{the island}} bear names testifying to Maltese presence: Maltezika is named after Malta and Cozzella got its name from Gozo. In Cozzella the Franciscan Sisters of Malta opened a convent and a school in 1907. Those two {{institutions}} still flourish. In 1923, there were some 1,200 ethnic Maltese in Corfu, but many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>spoke</b> either Greek or the local Corfiot dialect, which still bore traces of the Venetian occupation of the island. Because of this Venetian connection, Fascist propagandists tried to build up an irredentist case for Corfu. Guido Puccio wrote in [...] "Tribuna", a leading Roman newspaper on 12 September 1923, that the Maltese element in Corfu {{could be used as}} an instrument to further Italian claims on that island.|$|E

2500|$|In Singapore, due to {{influences}} {{from the}} media and the government such as the Speak Mandarin Campaign, Chinese Singaporeans whose ancestral language is Teochew are converting to mainly English and Mandarin. Some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>spoke</b> Cantonese due to the popularity of Hong Kong Cantonese entertainment media. Some of them only spoke the dialect of Teochew’s more influential mainstream counterpart, Minnan Proper (Hokkien) mainly {{due to the fact that}} Teochew is being overshadowed by Minnan Proper (Hokkien) as Minnan Proper (Hokkien) has far more speakers and more commonly heard than Teochew in Singapore and also partly due to the influence of Taiwanese Hokkien entertainment media. Teochew remains the ancestral language of many Chinese people in Singapore - Teochew people are the second largest Chinese group in Singapore, after the Hoklos (Minnan) - although Mandarin is gradually supplanting Teochew as their main language, especially amongst the younger generations.|$|E
2500|$|The Sifre {{explained}} {{about what}} Miriam and Aaron spoke to Moses in [...] Miriam {{found out that}} Moses had ceased to have marital relations with his wife Zipporah when Miriam observed that Zipporah was not making herself up with women’s ornaments. Miriam asked Zipporah why she was not making herself up like other women, and Zipporah answered that Moses did not {{pay any attention to}} such things. Thus Miriam realized that Moses has ceased having marital relations with Zipporah and told Aaron, and both Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses. Rabbi Nathan taught that Miriam was standing alongside Zipporah when (as recounted in [...] ) the youth ran and told Moses that Eldad and Medad were prophesying in the camp. When Zipporah heard the report, she lamented for the wives of Eldad and Medad because the men had become prophets, and the wives would thus lose their husbands’ attention. On that basis, Miriam realized the situation and told Aaron, and both <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>spoke</b> against Moses.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tone of the}} 17th Party Congress was {{different}} from its predecessors; several old oppositionists became delegates, and were re-elected to the Central Committee. For instance, Bukharin, Zinoviev, Yevgeni Preobrazhensky and Georgy Pyatakov were all rehabilitated. All <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>spoke</b> at the congress, even if {{most of them were}} interrupted. The Congress was split between two dominant factions, radicals (mostly Stalinists) and moderates. Several groups were established before the congress, which either opposed the Stalinist leadership (the Ryutin Group) or opposed socio-economic policies of the Stalinist leadership (the Syrtsov–Lominadze Group, Eismont–Tolmachev Group and the group headed by Alexander Petrovich Smirnov amongst others). [...] Politicians, who had previously opposed the Stalinist leadership, could be rehabilitated if they renounced their former beliefs and began supporting Stalin's rule. [...] However, the leadership was not opening up; Kamenev and Zinoviev were arrested in 1932 (or in the beginning of 1933), and set free in 1934, and than rearrested in 1935, accused of being part of an assassination plot which killed Sergei Kirov.|$|E

2500|$|Emperor Gaozu was sailing {{on a lake}} {{inside the}} Palace City {{during the time of}} the coup. [...] speculates that the emperor was alarmed by the {{impending}} crisis, thus he withdrew himself from the situation. He also surrounded himself with senior officials who were friendly to Li Shimin, because he possibly realized that Li Shimin was the cause of this and had better military connections that provided him with the advantage. The officials were Pei Ji, Xiao Yu, Chen Shuda, Feng Lun, Yan Shigu, Dou Dan (竇誕), and Yuwen Shiji. During the ongoing battle, Li Shimin sent Yuchi Jingde—who was still fully armed—into the Palace City to announce the news of the situation to Emperor Gaozu. Emperor Gaozu asked what was disturbing the peace and why he came. Yuchi Jingde replied: [...] "The Crown Prince and the Prince of Qi committed treason. The Prince of Qin mobilized his troops and executed them. He feared that Your Imperial Majesty would be shocked and he sent me to protect you." [...] Emperor Gaozu accepted the answer that he received from Yuchi Jingde. Subsequently, as the Zizhi Tongjian states, Emperor Gaozu turned to his officials and asked them: [...] "I did not anticipate that today I should see such a thing as this. What ought to be done about it?" [...] Two <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>spoke</b> highly meritoriously of Li Shimin and said that the killings of the two princely brothers served as a punishment. They also recommended Emperor Gaozu to appoint Li Shimin as the heir apparent.|$|E
