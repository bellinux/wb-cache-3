5000|$|The Province of Canada began issuing stamps on April 23, 1851. [...] The first were in {{the values}} of 3d, 6d, and 12d. Designed by Sir Sandford Fleming, the Threepenny Beaver {{depicted}} a beaver in an oval frame, and is considered the first Canadian postage stamp. It was the first stamp to picture an animal and not a monarch. It was the first <b>official</b> <b>postage</b> <b>stamp</b> anywhere to picture an animal, though an unofficial postmaster's provisional from St. Louis, Missouri showed two bears in 1845. The 6d was a portrait of Prince Albert from a drawing by William Drummond Esq. The 12d (1 shilling) was reproduced from a full-length painting of Queen Victoria done by Alfred Edward Chalon. All three stamps were produced by the firm of Rawdon, Wright, Hatch and Edson of New York.|$|E
5000|$|Reluctant to antagonize {{potential}} {{freight customers}} by refusing letters, but {{not wishing to}} interrupt company operations for free mail carriage, the company's purser, C.H. Parson, had the company print up its own <b>postage</b> <b>stamps.</b> One thousand [...] "stamps" [...] with the initials [...] "U.C." [...] (for Upper Columbia Company) and the denomination of 5 cents were printed. One thousand more [...] "labels" [...] with just the initials [...] "U.C" [...] were also printed. An ordinary letter in those days cost 3 cents to send, so the Upper Columbia Company's [...] "stamps" [...] were considerably more than regular postage. The idea {{seems to have been}} to discourage the use of the steamer for mail, and perhaps to make a little money on the side. The details of how stamps and labels were used are not clear, but clearly some did pass through the Canadian mails with additional <b>official</b> <b>postage</b> <b>stamps</b> also affixed. Genuine envelopes (called [...] "covers") bearing the stamps or labels of the Upper Columbia Company are rare philatelic items and are sought after by stamp collectors.|$|R

5000|$|The first <b>official</b> <b>postage</b> <b>stamp</b> to {{be issued}} for an airmail flight was in May 1917 when Poste italiane overprinted their {{existing}} special delivery stamps. The following year, the United States Post Office Department issued the first airmail stamp specifically issued for the purpose; while {{it does not have}} [...] "airmail" [...] or [...] "air post" [...] printed on it, it illustrates a Curtiss JN-4 airplane. One pane of 100 stamps were found to have an invert error, known as the Inverted Jenny, because the airplane image in the centre is inverted relative to the outer frame. The error {{is one of the most}} well known airmail stamps. Several countries, such as Germany, Finland, Russia and the United States, issued special airmail stamps, or overprinted stamps, for the Zeppelin flights that took place in the late 1920s and early 1930s.|$|E

50|$|The {{postmaster}} of the time, James Raymond, was {{in communication}} with Rowland Hill in England and worked to encourage the prepayment of letters in NSW. In 1838, Raymond introduced envelopes embossed with the seal of the colony, and available for local mail for 1¼ pence each instead of the 2d charged letters paid for in cash. They are thus regarded as precursors of the Penny Black. However, the envelopes were not popular, and in 1841 Raymond was unable to develop <b>official</b> interest in <b>postage</b> <b>stamps</b> for the colony.|$|R

[...] Their image and long-running success for nearly ten years have influenced many K-pop girl groups of the new generation, including GFriend, Melody Day, and Apink.

50|$|The first <b>official</b> mail <b>postage</b> <b>stamp,</b> {{known as}} the VR official, was issued by the United Kingdom {{at the same time}} as the Penny Black and Two pence blue. The VR Official {{utilised}} the same design as the Penny Black except that the stars in the top corners were removed and replaced by the letters V and R that gives the stamp its common name. On May 7, 1840, W.L. Maberly, Secretary to the British post office, sent a notice to all postmasters to which was affixed a pair of VR specimens as well as a pair of two penny blues. The notice charged the postmasters to note the letters in the upper corners of the stamp that was to be: applied to the correspondence of Public Departments, and other Persons formerly enjoying the privilege of Official Franking.|$|R
5000|$|Fatso was a spoof of the {{official}} Olympic mascots Olly, Millie, and Syd; whom Roy & HG disparaged as [...] "Olly, Millie and Dickhead". He was nicknamed [...] "the battlers' prince" [...] and {{proved to be more}} popular among Australian fans (and some visitors who viewed the program) than {{the official}} mascots. Fatso appeared with Gold Medalists Susie O'Neill, Grant Hackett and the Australian men's 4×200 metre relay team on the winners' dais. He consequently appears on an <b>official</b> commemorative <b>postage</b> <b>stamp</b> of the Australian men's 4×200 metre relay team in the arms of Michael Klim. During the Olympics, the Australian Olympic Committee attempted to ban athletes appearing with Fatso to stop him upstaging their official mascots. The ensuing public relations disaster forced the president of the AOC, John Coates, and the director general of the IOC, Francois Carrard, to distance their organisations from these attempts.|$|R
