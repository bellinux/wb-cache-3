5|$|A {{survey of}} 1000 {{secondary}} school pupils and university students in Tayside conducted in February 2010 found 20% {{of them had}} previously taken mephedrone. Although {{at the time it}} was available legally over the internet, only 10% of users reported purchasing it <b>online,</b> <b>with</b> most purchasing it from street dealers. Of those who had used mephedrone, 97% said it was easy or very easy to obtain. Around 50% of users reported at least one negative effect associated with the use of mephedrone, of which teeth grinding is the most common. Detailed interviews with users in Northern Ireland similarly found that few purchased mephedrone <b>online,</b> <b>with</b> most interviewees citing concerns that their address would be traced or that family members could intercept the package.|$|E

Also, <b>online</b> IGC <b>with</b> non-family elderly was perceived as more non-accommodating than <b>online</b> IGC <b>with</b> family elderly.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{consider}} an online non-preemptive scheduling problem on two related machines with rearrangement {{to minimize the}} completion time, called <b>online</b> scheduling <b>with</b> bounded rearrangement, which is a semi-online problem. Jobs arrive one by one over list. When a new job arrives at most K already scheduled jobs can {{be removed from the}} schedule, then all removed jobs and the new job must be assigned to the machines. The problem is a relaxation of the similar problem <b>online</b> scheduling <b>with</b> a buffer [4]. Assume machine M 1 has speed 1 and M 2 has speed s≥ 1. With respect to the worst case ratio, we obtain that (i) for s≥ 3 or K≥ 2, the model of <b>online</b> scheduling <b>with</b> bounded rearrangement is equivalent to the model of <b>online</b> scheduling <b>with</b> a bounded buffer; (ii) the model of <b>online</b> scheduling <b>with</b> bounded rearrangement is more powerful than the model of <b>online</b> scheduling <b>with</b> a bounded buffer for 2 ≤s 1. 618 the lower bound is improved...|$|R

5|$|Halo Wars 2 {{features}} {{a number of}} multiplayer modes that can be played <b>online</b> <b>with</b> up to six players. Skirmish is a cooperative or solo play mode against AI opponents. Deathmatch involves eliminating the opponent's army. Stronghold and Domination are territorial modes centered around controlling bases or nodes on the map. Blitz is a mode that combines elements from collectible card games with RTS gameplay by replacing the base building and resource management with a card-and-deck mechanic for unit deployment. Players create decks from card packs that are earned by playing the campaign mode and completing daily challenges. Each card {{features a}} unit that is deployed on the battlefield. Energy is the resource for using cards; more powerful units have a higher energy cost. Energy generates automatically throughout a match and more can be collected as additional energy supplies are dropped onto the map periodically. There is single-player and cooperative variant of Blitz named Firefight, which pits players against waves of AI enemies.|$|E
