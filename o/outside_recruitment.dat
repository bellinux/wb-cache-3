40|$|Estimating {{population}} {{trends for}} long-lived, migratory animals is challenging but essential for managing populations. Here we propose using {{a simple but}} potentially robust method, the direct estimation of population growth rate (PGR) from capture-recapture data. We considered an Endangered population of humpback whales Megaptera novaeangliae breeding and calving annually in the southern lagoon of New Caledonia. Studied since 1996, this population is known to exhibit a strong signal of transience, i. e. the presence of individuals that pass through the sampling area once, inducing detection heterogeneity. Another difficulty is that a more recently discovered second breeding and calving habitat (offshore seamounts to the south) has been surveyed with less intensity. Current direct PGR estimation models cannot deal with spatial sampling heterogeneity. In order to assess {{the reliability of the}} proposed method-in general and for our population in particular-we evaluated its robustness using simulations: first, when there are transient individuals; then, when the study area is split into 2 unequally sampled parts. We found no bias in PGR in the presence of transients. The bias with 2 unequally sampled parts depends on the amount and direction of exchanges, but appears negligible in our case study. The constant yearly PGR of the New Caledonian humpback whale population {{at the level of the}} 2 habitats was estimated at 1. 15 (95 % CI 1. 11 - 1. 20), suggesting <b>outside</b> <b>recruitment.</b> Whenever capture-recapture is feasible, we recommend the Pradel approach to estimate the PGR, validated with appropriate simulations, in order to assess population welfare...|$|E

40|$|Several {{studies suggest}} that assemblages in {{intertidal}} zones that experience frequent physical extremes (e. g. wave-impacts) should be highly dependent on the regional input of propagules. Therefore with higher disturbance in the intertidal zone, higher dependence on the species pool from nearby assemblages (e. g. subtidal) should be observed. Here we examine adult Community structure to investigate levels of similarity among marine assemblages of Arctic intertidal zones compared with those in adjacent subtidal areas. Additionally we compare Arctic results with similar data from a temperate area. We selected boulder fields as a model habitat and we predicted that subtidal and intertidal diversity would change differently under varying disturbance regimes. Multivariate analysis of data from Arctic and temperate North Atlantic indicates that in the Arctic, intertidal and subtidal assemblages were more similar to each other than were temperate intertidal and subtidal assemblages.

40|$|Predicting the {{strength}} and context-dependency of species interactions across multiple scales is a core area in ecology. This is especially challenging in the marine environment, where populations of most predators and prey are generally open, because of their pelagic larval phase, and recruitment of both is highly variable. In this study we use a comparativeexperimental approach on small and large spatial scales to test the relationship between predation intensity and prey recruitment and their relative importance in shaping populations of a dominant rocky intertidal space occupier, mussels, {{in the context of}} seascape (availability of nearby subtidal reef habitat). Predation intensity on transplanted mussels was tested inside and <b>outside</b> cages and <b>recruitment</b> was measured with standard larval settlement collectors. We found that on intertidal rocky benches with contiguous subtidal reefs in New Zealand, mussel larval recruitment is usually low but predation on recruits by subtidal consumers (fish, crabs) is intense during high tide. On nearby intertidal rocky benches with adjacent sandy subtidal habitats, larval recruitment is usually greater but subtidal predators are typically rare and predation is weaker. Multiple regression analysis showed that predation intensity accounts for most of the variability in the abundance of adult mussels compared to recruitment. This seascape-dependent, predation-recruitment relationship could scale up to explain regional community variability. We argue that community ecology models should include seascape contextdependency and its effects on recruitment and species interactions for better predictions of coastal community dynamic...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the migration intentions of sub-Saharan African medical students and health professionals {{within the context of}} a legacy of active international recruitment by receiving countries. However, many health workers migrate <b>outside</b> of this <b>recruitment</b> paradigm. This paper aims to explore the reasons for migration of health workers from sub-Saharan Africa to Belgium and Austria; European countries without a history of active recruitment in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: Data were collected using semistructured interviews. Twenty-seven health workers were interviewed about their migration experiences. Included participants were born in sub-Saharan Africa, had trained as health workers in sub-Saharan Africa, and were currently living in Belgium or Austria, though not necessarily currently working as a health professional. RESULTS: Both Austria and Belgium were shown not to be target countries for the health workers, who instead moved there by circumstance, rather than choice. Three principal reasons for migration were reported: 1) educational purposes; 2) political instability or insecurity in their country of origin; and 3) family reunification. In addition, two respondents mentioned medical reasons and, although less explicit, economic factors were also involved in several of the respondents' decision to migrate. CONCLUSION: These results highlight the importance of the broader economic, social, and political context within which migration decisions are made. Training opportunities proved to be an important factor for migration. A further development and upgrade of primary care might help to counter the common desire to specialize and improve domestic training opportunities...|$|R

While academic sites like Moscow, St Petersburg and Novosibirsk have all gained experience in clinical trials, smaller hospitals in peripheral sites have also participated. During 2004, more than 40 000 patients were recruited and more than 500 clinical trials were initiated in Russia. Nine of 14 US Food and Drug Administration inspections performed in the country since 1994 went without findings and no inspection required official follow-up action from the agency, indicating that high-quality data can be obtained from Russia. While the recruitment and quality in clinical trials meet very high standards in Eastern European countries, the lack of information on local rules and regulations is still a factor which limits this under-used region. Executive power reforms launched in Russia in 2004 have affected clinical trial performance and brought the legislation into accord with international guidelines. State regulation and supervision of clinical trials is {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Federal Service for Control in Healthcare and Social Development, which itself is a part of the Ministry of Health. Two levels of ethical review are present in Russia, the National Ethics Committee (NEC) and the local ethics committees that exist at the majority of investigative sites.

Among other developments, revised regulations have introduced a 30 -day period within which the NEC has to give its opinion on a trial, putting a limit to the time allowed for clinical trial approval. Recent changes in legislation have made the process of clinical trial approval better defined and more transparent, thus, contributing to a decrease in the administrative burden.

40|$|Chromatin is {{composed}} of DNA, histones, and other proteins and contributes to DNA packaging, controlling gene expression and DNA replication. This work focuses on the contributions of histones H 3 and H 4 to gene regulation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. I identified a region of the nucleosome that is critical for three types of long-range transcriptional silencing but not for local repression mediated {{by some of the}} same proteins. In S. cerevisiae, the Sir complex performs long range silencing of the mating type loci, while the promoter specific Sum 1 complex represses mid-sporulation genes. Interestingly, the SUM 1 - 1 mutation changes the Sum 1 repression complex into a silencing complex capable of long range spreading. Sum 1 - 1 provides a good model to distinguish between properties of nucleosomes important for long-range silencing (common to Sum 1 - 1 and Sir silencing), and specific interactions nucleosomes might make with the Sum 1 complex (common to Sum 1 and Sum 1 - 1 complexes). Interactions between nucleosomes and silencing proteins are critical to Sir silencing, and the spreading ability of Sum 1 - 1 p suggests that a component of the Sum 1 - 1 complex may also interact with nucleosomes. Since the Sum 1 - 1 and Sum 1 complex components are shared, histone contacts may also contribute to wild type Sum 1 repression. I investigated the contributions of histones H 3 and H 4 to Sum 1 - 1 silencing and Sum 1 repression using a genetic screen. Interestingly, I found histone mutations that disrupt Sum 1 - 1 silencing and cluster in the LRS/H 4 region of the nucleosome, which was previously identified to disrupt silencing at the mating type loci, telomeres, and rDNA. Therefore, this region of the nucleosome is important to silencing mediated by three distinct complexes- Sir, RENT, and Sum 1 - 1. The Sir 3 p bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domain binds this region of the nucleosome to facilitate Sir spreading and silencing, and I tested Orc 1 p, a paralog of Sir 3 p, to determine if it makes similar contributions to Sum 1 - 1 silencing. Using reporter mating assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation, I found that mutations and deletion of the BAH domain of Orc 1 p disrupt Sum 1 - 1 silencing. These results suggest that Orc 1 p may interact with this region of the nucleosome and contribute to Sum 1 - 1 silencing <b>outside</b> of <b>recruitment.</b> Surprisingly, Sum 1 repression was not disrupted by histone mutations. I conducted in vitro binding assays to identify a region in Sum 1 p that may interact with histones and account for the spreading ability of Sum 1 - 1 p. Consistent with results that histones do not contribute to Sum 1 repression, I did not find evidence of Sum 1 p binding to histone peptides. Therefore, interactions with histones H 3 and H 4 are important to Sir and Sum 1 - 1 silencing and not Sum 1 repression. These interactions with histones may facilitate the formation of higher order chromatin structures necessary for long range silencing complexes. I also identified mutations in the H 3 tail that disrupt Sum 1 - 1 silencing. Surprisingly, these mutations did not disrupt the enrichment of Sum 1 - 1 p. Similar observations have been made for Sir proteins {{in the absence of the}} H 3 tail, and the H 3 tail may contribute to chromatin compaction and silencing after the assembly of silencing proteins. Therefore, the Sir and Sum 1 - 1 complexes may share several features that facilitate silencing. The use of the LRS/H 4 region of the nucleosome may be a common interaction surface with silencing proteins, and the H 3 tail may assist in the formation of a specialized chromatin structure. These interactions may also be utilized in the formation of heterochromatin in higher eukaryotes. Dissertatio...|$|R
