40|$|Abstract. Geometric {{planning}} parameters <b>of</b> <b>milking</b> parlors <b>of</b> similar {{capacity and}} different arrangement of animals on cow platform were analyzed. Indicator (K) was calculated {{to reflect the}} ratio of length (L) to width (W) of the cow platform. It {{can be used by}} designers and farmers for practical purposes to select the type or capacity <b>of</b> a cow <b>milking</b> parlor when reconstruction an existing facility (at particular planning parameters available). This study discusses alternative solutions for <b>milking</b> parlors <b>of</b> various configurations (tandem, herringbone, and parallel type parlors) of capacity from 2 x 5 to 2 x 10 cows. The following planning parameters were investigated: absolute and relative (per milking stall) floorage area <b>of</b> <b>milking</b> parlors with various configuration (without entrance/exit traffic lanes) at respective capacity; ratio indicator (К) of the main dimensions (length and width) <b>of</b> the <b>milking</b> zone as guidance for selection <b>of</b> a <b>milking</b> parlor at specified conditions (reconstruction of existing facility). For each alternative the dimensions (length and width) at respective capacity and configuration were taken, and only the milking zone without animal entrance and exist lanes was considered. Conclusions drawn from the results are aimed at minimizing the relative area <b>of</b> <b>milking</b> stalls in the design <b>of</b> <b>milking</b> parlors at specified technological conditions...|$|R

5|$|A minor {{class of}} sheep are the dairy breeds.

5|$|Although not all Jews in Israel keep kosher, the {{tradition}} of kashrut strongly influences the availability of certain foods and their preparation in homes, public institutions and many restaurants, including the separation <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> and meat and avoiding the use of non-kosher foods, especially pork and shellfish.

5|$|Certain {{types of}} cheeses require {{inoculation}} <b>of</b> <b>milk</b> curds with fungal species that impart a unique flavor and texture to the cheese. Examples include the blue color in cheeses such as Stilton or Roquefort, {{which are made}} by inoculation with Penicillium roqueforti. Molds used in cheese production are non-toxic and are thus safe for human consumption; however, mycotoxins (e.g., aflatoxins, roquefortine C, patulin, or others) may accumulate because of growth of other fungi during cheese ripening or storage.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the amount <b>of</b> cow <b>milk</b> production and its price in Turkey in the period between 1985 - 2015. The Koyck model that is one of the distributed lag models was used to analyse of these data. The production <b>of</b> cow <b>milk</b> was considered as dependent variable and the price series consisting <b>of</b> cow <b>milk</b> prices and lagged price series are considered as explanatory variable in the model. According to the results of Koyck model, it was determined that the production <b>of</b> cow <b>milk</b> was affected by the prices of maximum one year retrospectively and the time required to dramatically affect to production <b>of</b> cow <b>milk</b> <b>of</b> the change taken place in prices <b>of</b> cow <b>milk</b> was 2. 9 years. Furthermore, the increase of 1 TL in price <b>of</b> cow <b>milk</b> decreases the production <b>of</b> cow <b>milk</b> by 183372. 4 tonnes. On the other hand, the increase of 1 TL in prices in the previous period decreases the production <b>of</b> cow <b>milk</b> by 137345. 9 tonnes. Based on these data, it can be said that the price <b>of</b> cow <b>milk</b> composed in the free market conditions is rather efficient in determination to production amount. In conclusion, economic measures such as making of production planning, constituting of efficient marketing opportunities, price policies and giving a place to stable production can be taken against to fluctutations in the price increases...|$|R
