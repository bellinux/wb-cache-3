40|$|The Malm aquifer in {{southern}} Germany {{is one of}} the country’s most important geothermal reservoirs due to groundwater temperatures exceeding 100 °C and a high-flow regime. This thesis deals with the hydraulic and hydrochemical characterization of the Malm aquifer <b>with</b> regard to <b>a</b> minimization of the exploration risk of geothermal boreholes. The aim of this study is the analysis of processes that control groundwater dynamics and mass transport in the deep molasse in order to derive information on the flow regime and the groundwater quality of the aquifer. Within the scope of a first study, the hydrochemical conditions as well as the groundwater evolution are investigated based on the analysis of data obtained from 140 wells. As a result of major ion analyses, 6 hydrochemical water types are distinguished in the aquifer. In {{the northern part of the}} aquifer a Ca-(Mg) -HCO 3 water type occurs. These groundwaters are characterized by low mineralization and isotopic signatures indicating a recharge under recent climate conditions. Towards the central basin the Na-Ca-Mg-HCO 3 water type (IIa) is common and implies the influence of ion exchange processes and an increase of the total mineralization due to NaCl-waters leaking out of the overlying Tertiary formations. However, this infiltration volume is low compared to the groundwater exchange rates in the Malm aquifer. Therefore, the Na-Ca-HCO 3 -Cl water type (IIb) is still dominating in deeper parts of the aquifer. Their stable isotope signatures reflect colder climate conditions during recharge. The crystalline basement of the “Landshut-Neuöttinger Hoch” acts as a hydraulic barrier as well as a hydrochemical boundary to the Na-HCO 3 -Cl-waters in the Lower Bavarian Basin. A fourth water type (Na-HCO 3 -Cl) is detected in the northeastern basin, which is characterized by low earth alkali/alkali ratios combined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high mineralization. Here, Na-Cl-HCO 3 water indicates the inflow of deep groundwaters from the crystalline basement of the Bavarian Forest (Bayerischer Wald). Special attention is paid to the less permeable rocks in the southwestern part of the Molasse Basin, where highly mineralized Na-Cl-HCO 3 formation waters dominate with occasionally increased hydrocarbon concentrations of still unknown origin. In order to determine the applicability of these waters for geothermal exploitation, a hydrogeochemical model is developed. The model results indicate that high concentrations of hydrosulphide as well as certain pressure and temperature conditions significantly promote mineral precipitation and corrosion in a geothermal binary cycle. The second part of this thesis examines the lithofacial influence on the productivity of the Moosburg SC 4 well. The well was drilled in 1990 to a final depth of 1585. 20 m. Purbeck (134 m) and Malm (453 m) were cored completely. The facial development is described based on 31 thin-sections of core samples obtained from the Malm basis to the Lowermost Cretaceous. The main focus is on the thick-bedded dolomites of the Malm Delta to Zeta 2, which are compared to outcrops in the Northern and Southern Franconian Alb, respectively. Size and morphology of the various dolomite types as well as the total porosity (18 samples) and permeability are analyzed. The thicknesses of the exploitable units with varying petrophysical characteristics are about 106 m for Malm Delta–Epsilon, 37 m for Malm Zeta 1 and 61 m for Malm Zeta 2. Porosities vary between << 1 % and 17. 1 %. The permeability is caused by intercrystalline pores between dolomite crystals (matrix permeability) and varies between 0. 03 and 63 mD. Size, morphology and interlocking of the dolomite crystals control the permeability. Fine-, medium- and coarse-crystalline, hypidiomorphic to idiomorphic dolomite crystals (up to 300 µm in size) of the Malm Delta-Epsilon exhibit permeabilities of up to 63 mD. In contrast, units <b>with</b> <b>a</b> higher content of non-carbonates (clay; higher gamma log) are mainly composed of xenomorphic to hypidiomorphic dolomite crystals up to 100 µm in size and reveal permeabilities between 0. 03 and 0. 26 mD. Highly porous zones (up to 17. 1 %) in the Malm Zeta 1 consist of idiomorphic crystals (20 - 70 µm), which form <b>a</b> loose, <b>open</b> crystal <b>texture</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> comparatively high permeability (6. 5 mD and 46 mD). Based on the determined permeabilities of 0. 03 mD to 63 mD, matrix productivities of 8 e- 6 to 1. 6 e- 2 l/(s•bar) are calculated under reservoir conditions (Temp. = 77 °C, TDS = 650 mg/l) for a 1 m thick interval in the well-bedded dolomite zone of the Moosburg SC 4 well. Hypothetically, a matrix productivity index of 3. 8 l/(s•bar) can be calculated from the maximum matrix productivity in relation to the entire dolomite unit thickness of 236 m. When comparing this hypothetical value to the calculated total productivity of the well of 5. 4 l/(s•bar), which was obtained from pumping test analyses, it becomes clear that even under these conditions only 70 % of the inflow is gained from the matrix. However, most of the determined matrix permeabilities are significantly smaller than the maximal value. This leads to the assumption, that fissured and karstified zones supply the most important inflow volume to the Moosburg SC 4 well. The third part of this thesis concentrates on the hydraulic characterization of the Malm aquifer based on pumping and drill-stem test data obtained from 98 wells. The analysis of thermally affected pumping test data requires the development of a method to adjust measured hydraulic heads, which enables a first interpretation of the pressure regime of many tests. Based on the interpretation of the hydraulic test data, information on mud losses as well as a detailed analysis of the paleohydrogeographic development, a map of the regional hydraulic conductivity distribution in the Malm aquifer is generated. Due to intensive karstification, the highest permeabilities of up to 1 e- 4 m/s occur along the northern border of the basin and on the southern rim of the Lower Bavarian Basin. Hydraulic conductivities of 1 e- 5 m/s characterize the karstified regions south of the river Danube. While west of the river Iller the permeability is rapidly decreasing {{in southern}} direction towards the Helvetic facies (< 1 e- 8 m/s), values of T/H = 1 e- 5 m/s extend to the Greater Munich Area. The high conductivity in the deeper parts of the basin is probably caused by intensive karstification of the South German carbonate platform during the Cretaceous. The greater Munich area, which is characterized by decreasing permeabilities from T/H = 1 e- 5 m/s in the northeast to T/H = 1 e- 7 m/s in the southwest, represents the transition zone to less permeable areas in the west. This thesis gives a concise overview on the results of more than 80 years of exploration of the Malm aquifer in the German Molasse Basin and provides a comprehensive insight into the hydraulic and hydrochemical conditions of this thermal system. It becomes apparent, that the Malm aquifer is a complex system consisting of pores, fractures and karst cavities, although on a larger basin scale, hydrostratigraphic units with similar characteristics can be combined. According to groundwater temperatures, hydraulic conductivities and hydrochemistry, the Malm aquifer in the South German Molasse Basin is <b>a</b> hydrogeothermal reservoir <b>with</b> <b>a</b> high potential for heat and electricity production...|$|R
