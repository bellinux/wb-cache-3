40|$|This study {{argues that}} to improve school effectiveness, schools and {{educators}} {{should focus on}} even more basic elements than those posited by other research.

The educational value of that basic opportunity then depends on how teachers and students use the time available during the day, whether materials are present and used by them, and whether class sizes are reasonable.
