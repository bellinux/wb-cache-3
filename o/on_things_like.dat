I was picking up <b>on</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> Chesterton and Conan Doyle, and the sense (which is also in Jane Austen) of what it was to be an English gentleman at the time when England was a very confident place". In particular, [...] "it's the sort of Englishness which is stuffy but fundamentally benevolent, and fundamentally very responsible {{about the rest of the}} world", which connects Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes to Clarke's Jonathan Strange.|$|E
500|$|On September 15, Fisher sent {{an email}} to 400-plus players asking for unity. In the email, {{he said that}} recent {{meetings}} were [...] "effective". He suggested that the failure of having a deal was not due to disagreement between players and owners, but due to disagreement among owners. Fisher also used the opportunity to counter agents' suggestion of disbanding the union, {{saying that they were}} not making [...] "a drastic move that leaves players without a union". According to sources, there was indeed disagreement among the owners. Some thought players' proposal of taking 52% of BRI was fair, and were willing to compromise <b>on</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> tying players' future earnings to NBA's future revenue growth and maintaining current salary level. Cavaliers' Dan Gilbert and Suns' Robert Sarver were among the hardliners who oppose the deal while Knicks' James Dolan and the Lakers' Jerry Buss were among the group in favor of it. Stern denied that there was a rift among owners the following day, saying, [...] "I don't know what the basis of Derek's belief is." ...|$|E

500|$|James Panero, {{reviewer}} for The New York Times, called Street Gang a [...] "behind {{the lens}} story" [...] and the [...] "first comprehensive account" [...] of Sesame Street. [...] Panero found Davis' history tireless, but objected to Davis' emphasis on unimportant details. [...] As a result, {{and due to}} Davis' inclusion of every anecdote and biography of everyone involved with its creation and history, Panero considers the book an oral history rather than a tightly organized narrative. [...] Other reviewers note that Street Gang is too much like its subject, episodic and unfocused. [...] Diana Wagman of The L.A. Times states that Davis choice of what to focus on is odd; for example, {{there is a great}} deal of focus in the book <b>on</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> the licensing and merchandising agreement of the Muppets, but very little attention on Mississippi's 1970 ban of the show. [...] Wagman states, [...] "Yes, we get a little past-tense womanizing, a lot of drinking and a psychotic breakdown later in the book, but it all seems sad, not salacious, and not germane to the basic story". [...] Nick Gillespie of The Washington Post agrees. [...] He calls Jim Henson, who is mentioned often in the book, [...] "an almost completely enigmatic character".|$|E
500|$|The {{gameplay}} received {{mixed reviews}} from critics. In {{a review of}} the PSP version of My Spanish Coach, IGN noted that acquiring mastery points in the minigames lead to [...] "quite a bit of grinding" [...] due to the game's repetitive structure. Nevertheless, IGN accepted that the repetition was an effective way to learn the vocabulary, and noted that [...] "icking up <b>on</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> gender and age, emphasis and the breakdowns of the actual language itself and proper/casual ways of conversing are made fairly clear and reinforced regularly". IGN's review of the DS versions of both games commented that neither game taught the future or past tense, calling it one of the [...] "most disappointing" [...] aspects of the game, but praised the effective incorporation of the DS stylus into the minigames. Eurogamer noted that the minigames were [...] "only really good for practicing reading" [...] {{due to a lack of}} games for practicing proper speaking, but GameZone disagreed, noting that the player was able to hear their attempt to speak the French or Spanish words alongside the correct pronunciation during lessons, and praised this aspect as the [...] "most interesting and intriguing feature of [...] ". In {{a review of the}} DS version of My Spanish Coach, Nintendo World Report lamented that many of the minigames [...] "exhibit the same type of unimaginative boringness" [...] and that [...] "it takes ages to unlock new lessons and mini-games"; however, it noted that the minigames were [...] "extremely effective" [...] and [...] "constructed extremely well" [...] in terms of teaching the language. Nintendo World Report's review of the DS version of My French Coach called the game's reference section [...] "a very handy travel dictionary", noting that having a dictionary list and a phrasebook with audio files that could bookmark chosen phrases was [...] "an absurd value".|$|E

According to a 2010 report by The Independent, RT journalists have said that coverage of sensitive issues in Russia is allowed, but direct criticism of Vladimir Putin or President Dmitry Medvedev was not. Masha Karp wrote in Standpoint magazine that contemporary Russian issues [...] "such as the suppression of free speech and peaceful demonstrations, or the economic inefficiency and corrupt judiciary, are either ignored or their significance played down". In 2008, Stephen Heyman wrote in The New York Times that in RT's Russia, [...] "corruption is not quite a scourge but a symptom of a developing economy." [...] Speaking after the launch of RT America, Garry Kasparov said [...] "Russia Today is an extension of the methods and approach of the state-controlled media inside Russia, applied in a bid to influence the American cable audience".|$|E

Åkerfeldt explained, [...] "We didn't have any money to spend <b>on</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that. That would cost us, at least, a couple of hundred bucks... We didn't know where to go to record a demo." [...] Åkerfeldt had sent out {{rehearsal}} tapes to several labels, but never received a reply. But the band received an offer from Lee Barrett to record an album. Åkerfeldt found it [...] "quite weird". Anders Nyström (of Katatonia) said Candlelight was interested, based on a rumor from Samoth (of Emperor). Samoth had sent out a tape of unsigned bands to Barrett at Candlelight. It only had a few seconds of [...] "The Apostle in Triumph". Barrett liked it so much he wanted to sign the band. Later, Åkerfeldt received a call from Barrett, who wanted to release a full-length album by Opeth.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{innovations}} of {{the early}} Ultimas – in particular [...] (1983) – eventually became standard among later RPGs, {{such as the use}} of tiled graphics and party-based combat, its mix of fantasy and science-fiction elements, and the introduction of time travel as a plot device. In turn, some of these elements were inspired by Wizardry, specifically the party-based combat. Exodus was also revolutionary in its use of a written narrative to convey a larger story than the typically minimal plots that were common at the time. Most video games – including Garriott's own Ultima I and II and Akalabeth – tended to focus primarily <b>on</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> combat without venturing much further. In addition, Garriott would introduce in Ultima IV a theme that would persist throughout later Ultimas – a system of chivalry and code of conduct in which the player, or [...] "Avatar", is tested periodically (in both obvious and unseen ways) and judged according to his or her actions. This system of morals and ethics was unique, in that in other video games players could for the most part act and do as they wished without having to consider the consequences of their actions.|$|E
2500|$|Since Conley's {{theory of}} reform was based so heavily on manual labor, {{he had spent}} little time and money <b>on</b> <b>things</b> <b>like</b> {{education}} and vocational training. [...] In the 1920s, the prison library was {{the only means of}} inmate education; the only classes being taught boiled down to English-speaking instruction for immigrant inmates. [...] The library itself, donated mostly by William Clark before 1920, was outdated, contained mainly light fiction, and had been stringently censored by prison officials. [...] As far as vocational training was concerned, Conley had dealt the prison another blow by removing all his personal equipment from the warehouse, garage, and machine shop; since his contract specified that the buildings, grounds, and land belonged to the state, he had populated these important industries with his own materials to further entrench himself within the prison. [...] This left the prisoners with only industries relating to the upkeep of the prison: laundry, garment construction, maintenance, a toy shop (which made toys for children in state institutions) and the prison band. [...] In the '20s, the warden of the prison took on the role of Registrar of Motor Vehicles and obtained permission for inmates to manufacture license plates.|$|E

25|$|However, the Meditator {{realizes that}} he is often {{convinced}} when he is dreaming that he is sensing real objects. He feels certain that he is awake and sitting by the fire, but reflects that often he has dreamed this very sort of thing and been wholly convinced by it. Though his present sensations may be dream images, he suggests that even dream images are drawn from waking experience, much like paintings in that respect. Even when a painter creates an imaginary creature, like a mermaid, the composite parts are drawn from real things—women and fish, {{in the case of}} a mermaid. And even when a painter creates something entirely new, at least the colors in the painting are drawn from real experience. Thus, the Meditator concludes, though he can doubt composite things, he cannot doubt the simple and universal parts from which they are constructed like shape, quantity, size, time, etc. While we can doubt studies based <b>on</b> composite <b>things,</b> <b>like</b> medicine, astronomy, or physics, he concludes that we cannot doubt studies based <b>on</b> simple <b>things,</b> <b>like</b> arithmetic and geometry.|$|R
