40|$|ACAF was {{involved}} in curating Manifesta 8, European Biennial of Contemporary Art that recently closed its doors to the public. Manifesta is an itinerate biennale taking place every {{two years in a}} different European host region/city. In 2010 it was hosted by Murcia and Cartagena in Eastern Spain it was curated by three different curatorial collectives, each of them developing a project as an autonomous curatorial contribution. The collectives were ACAF - Alexandria Contemporary Arts Forum, CPS - Chamber of Public Secrets and tranzit. org. The ACAF curatorial team for Manifesta 8 was made up of Bassam El Baroni (artistic director, ACAF) and Jeremy Beaudry (associate curator of ACAF's Manifesta 8 project and a practicing artist and university professor based in Philadelphia, USA). Their curatorial assistant was Yolanda Riquelme Garcia a young curator from Murcia. For Manifesta 8, ACAF raised the question 'How can any art project genuinely touch on the sophisticated and haphazard web of life's complexity?' In response, they proposed <b>OVERSCORE,</b> a multifaceted project held together by the logic of a specially devised, theoretical interface called The Theory of Applied Enigmatics. Here, the term 'Enigmatics' refers to ideas and proposals which appear or resonate from a confrontation with complexity. An <b>overscore</b> is a line drawn through words. It partially erases them but also shows an ongoing process of editing; it reveals and obscures the past, while establishing links with what emerges in the present and future. Similarly, The Theory of Applied Enigmatics both highlights and seeks to revise the accepted institutional blueprints - those sometimes idealistic and often subconscious models - which are used to simplify complex issues concerning life, people, places, events, history and culture within artistic practice today. It also acts as the mechanism connecting the intellectual input of a diverse array of artists and contributors. The theory offers itself to the visitor as a key with which s/he can unlock the underlying frameworks of history, culture and politics existing in, and between, the artists' works. <b>OVERSCORE</b> was a project held together by the logic that The Theory of Applied Enigmatics outlined and oversaw, one project with four components, spread across three venues. <b>OVERSCORE</b> featured works and contributions by 37 artists and collaborators, the exhibition component alone presented newly-commissioned and existing works by 27 artists and collectives. Manifesta 8 Flashback is an exhibition that presents 5 video works that were part of <b>OVERSCORE</b> at Manifesta 8, the works are by Michael Paul Britto, Common Culture, Melanie Gilligan, Nastio Mosquito, and Wanda Raimundi-Ortiz.

40|$|Abstract. —In the Bayesian paradigm, {{a common}} method for {{comparing}} two models is {{to compute the}} Bayes factor, defined as the ratio of their respective marginal likelihoods. In recent phylogenetic works, the numerical evaluation of marginal likelihoods has often been performed using the harmonic mean estimation procedure. In the present article, we propose to employ another method, based on an analogy with statistical physics, called thermodynamic integration. We describe the method, propose an implementation, and show on two analytical examples that this numerical method yields reliable estimates. In contrast, the harmonic mean estimator leads to a strong overestimation of the marginal likelihood, which {{is all the more}} pronounced as the model is higher dimensional. As a result, the harmonic mean estimator systematically favors more parameter-rich models, an artefact that might explain some recent puzzling observations, based on harmonic mean estimates, suggesting that Bayes factors tend to <b>overscore</b> complex models. Finally, we apply our method to the comparison of several alternative models of amino-acid replacement. We confirm our previous observations, indicating that modeling pattern heterogeneity across sites tends to yield better models than standard empirical matrices.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the cardiorespiratory fitness and perceived exertion of female patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) compared with that of healthy female subjects. DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: This was designed as a cross-sectional case-control study, with a consecutive sample of 30 female patients with FMS and an age-matched control group of 67 healthy female subjects. SETTING: This study was conducted at the multidisciplinary pain center of a university hospital in a city of more than 1 million inhabitants. OUTCOME MEASURES: A cardiorespiratory fitness index (PWC 65 %/kg) and an original perceived exertion index (B 65 %) were obtained from the heart rates and perceived exertions scored on a 10 -point Borg scale during a submaximal cycle ergometer test. Average indexes for the FMS patients and control subjects were compared. RESULTS: The mean cardiorespiratory fitness index of the FMS patients was not significantly different from that of the controls. The mean perceived exertion index in the FMS patients was significantly greater than that of the controls, meaning that the FMS patients systematically reported higher ratings of perceived exertion during exercise. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiorespiratory fitness, as expressed by a submaximal work capacity index, seems normal in female patients with FMS compared with age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. The fact that FMS patients <b>overscore</b> their perception of exertion may be due to a greater overlap of peripheral pain and perceived exertion perceptions during exercise. This observation should be noted when using perceived exertion scores to prescribe and monitor exercise in FMS patients...|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{inconsistent}} {{prevalence of}} fluorosis {{for a given}} level of fluoride in drinking water suggests developmental defects of enamel (DDEs) other than fluorosis were being misdiagnosed as fluorosis. The imprecise definition and subjective perception of fluorosis indices could result in misdiagnosis of dental fluorosis. This {{study was conducted to}} distinguish genuine fluorosis from fluorosis-resembling defects that could have adverse health-related events as a cause using Early Childhood Events Life-grid method (ECEL). Methods. A study was conducted on 400 9 -year-old children from areas with high, optimal and low levels of fluoride in the drinking water of Fars province, Iran. Fluorosis cases were diagnosed on the standardized one view photographs of the anterior teeth using Dean’s and TF (Thylstrup and Fejerskov) Indices by calibrated dentists. Agreements between examiners were tested. Early childhood health-related data collected retrospectively by ECEL method were matched with the position of enamel defects. Results. Using both Dean and TF indices three out of four dentists diagnosed that 31. 3 % (115) children had fluorosis, 58. 0 %, 29. 1 %, and 10. 0 % in high (2. 12 – 2. 85 ppm), optimal (0. 62 – 1. 22 ppm), and low (0. 24 – 0. 29 ppm) fluoride areas respectively (p < 0. 001). After matching health-related events in the 115 (31. 3 %) of children diagnosed with fluorosis, 31 (8. 4 %) of children had fluorosis which could be matched with their adverse health-related events. This suggests that what was diagnosed as fluorosis were non-fluoride related DDEs that resemble fluorosis. Discussion. The frequently used measures of fluorosis appear to <b>overscore</b> fluorosis. Use of ECEL method to consider health related events relevant to DDEs could help to differentiate between genuine fluorosis and fluorosis-resembling defects...|$|E

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} (CAD) {{is one of}} the main causes of {{premature}} mortality in the Western world, however with early and targeted treatment it is treatable. Calcium scoring multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) imaging is used to visualize small calcified plaques located in the coronary arteries which represent a possible arterial narrowing, thus limiting or preventing the supply of oxygenated blood to the heart muscle. A clinician digitally quantifies the patient plaque burden to determine appropriate treatment, such as lipid lowering drugs, based on defined risk categories. MSCT is capable of imaging the entire heart within a single breath hold, thus exposing the patient to lower dose compared to coronary angiography, however this results in lower contrast images that may be affected by acquisition and motion artefacts. Clinically significant calcified plaques are located in the main coronary arteries, whereas other clinically insignificant calcified plaques can be found in close proximity but will not affect blood flow through the coronary arteries and thus does not concern the clinician for calcium scoring. This can lead to inter- and intra- observer variability when distinguishing between clinically significant and insignificant plaques, resulting in incorrect plaque burden quantification. Reducing the subjectivity and reproducibility in calcium scoring can lead to greater accuracy in patient treatment prescription as small score shifts will affect atherosclerosis risk categorisation. For a disease where treatment can include drug prescription, the reduction of non-required drug prescription is an important objective. A preliminary automation of the calcium scoring method was developed presenting good correlation between automated and observer generated risk assignment, however, variation in automated scores signified over or under inclusion of non clinically significant or clinically significant plaques respectively. Thus it was theorised that the extraction of the coronary artery tree would facilitate focussed calcified plaque assessment and quantification. To achieve this goal, a fully automated observer-less calcium scoring framework has been presented employing automated heart isolation and coronary artery tracking. Ground truth coronary artery trees are applied to aid vessel tracking, compensating for the poor image clarity and low axial resolution of MSCT calcium scoring images. Validation of this system employs ground truth clinical calcium scores obtained by an observer study using simulated CT images from the XCAT digital phantom. Assessment of atherosclerosis risk categorisation of the resulting scores from the framework presented in this thesis against ground truth shows a 93. 8 % system accuracy with a 85. 4 % sensitivity and 96. 5 % specificity when examined against the minimum cases required to represent agreement between all observers. However, combined observer performance of 0. 729 from ROC analysis affirms observer variability in manual calcium scoring. Overall score difference analysis between framework and observer scores show an average of 10 % <b>overscore</b> and underscore respectively, thus indicating compensation by the automated framework for observer variability based on the use of vessel tracking to identify actual coronary calcified plaques.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} divided into three {{separate}} chapters. In the first chapter, I analyze the relationship between age and college entrance test score and enrollment. In the second chapter, I focus on how cell phone bans affect driving fatalities rates. Finally, the third chapter studies nationalistic bias in the professional division of surfing. In the next three paragraphs, I summarize these three chapters. 	The consequences of single-date school entry systems, which generate a large age difference between children in the same class, are now a widely studied subject. Published research has shown that older children consistently outperform their younger counterparts in several outcomes while in elementary and in the beginning of high school, however, evidence is weak when one considers long-run outcomes such as wages or the probability of being employed. In this chapter I use data from a major university in Brazil to investigate whether age differences significantly affect students' college entrance test scores and their probability of being accepted for higher education. Results show that older students outperform younger students on test scores and, more importantly, this difference significantly affects their likelihood of being accepted in college. These results suggest that age differences might have important long-run effects given its direct link to students' access to higher education. 	There has been significant amount of research in the transportation area on the development of strategies that allow good comparisons between states, such that policy analysis are allowed to be carried out and informative policy-oriented questions are allowed to be answered. In this chapter I propose the use of Synthetic Control Methods (SCM) to overcome several identification problems present in previous studies when constructing comparison groups/counterfactuals. I apply the SCM to analyze the effect of New York State’s law prohibiting handheld cell phone use while driving on fatalities rates. Results show that (i) a convex combination of the states of IL, MA and TX provide a good (synthetic) “peer state” for NY when evaluating this specific policy and (ii) that imposing the ban lead to a decrease of about 9 % in fatality rates. 	The past two decades has seen an increasing interest in detecting and quantifying hidden actions taken by agents when facing decisions that may lead to higher individual payoffs but are not easily observed by all parties involved. One such area that has recently received a lot of attention is on understanding the decision making process of professional referees in sports. In this chapter I estimate nationalistic bias using data from the world's elite division of professional surfing. Different from previous sports analyzed in the literature, surfing competitions are composed mainly by man-on-man heats with surfers having as many as 15 performances scored by the same judging panel in each heat, allowing one to overcome the main difficulty encountered by previous researchers which is to correctly identify whether judges misbehavior is a result of preferences over the way athletes perform in a specific country or is driven by intentionally misreporting scores to benefit a fellow countrymen. Different from what has consistently been reported in the literature, results show that surfing judges neither underscore nor <b>overscore</b> their fellow compatriots. However, they significantly underscore athletes competing against their countrymen. Also, the score given by the judge scoring the surfer competing against his countrymen is statistically smaller than all other judges' scores when the compatriot is losing, but statistically the same when the compatriot is winning, which supports the idea that judges’ bias is a result of strategic behavior. Finally, the large score penalties are shown to {{have a significant effect on}} final heat positions and, as a consequence, final points and prizes earned in the tournament...|$|E

Sixty-five human permanent molars were selected and one site in each occlusal surface was chosen as the test site. The teeth were cut and prepared according to each technique: stereomicroscopy without coloring (1), dye enhancement with rhodamine B (2) and fuchsine/acetic light green (3), and semi-quantitative microradiography (4). Digital photographs from each prepared tooth were assessed by three examiners for caries extension. Weighted kappa, as well as Friedman's test with multiple comparisons, was performed to compare all techniques and verify statistical significant differences. Results: kappa values varied from 0. 62 to 0. 78, the latter being found by both dye enhancement methods. Friedman's test showed statistical significant difference (P < 0. 001) and multiple comparison identified these differences among all techniques, except between both dye enhancement methods (rhodamine B and fuchsine/acetic light green). Cross-tabulation showed that the stereomicroscopy <b>overscored</b> the lesions. Both dye enhancement methods showed a good agreement, while stereomicroscopy <b>overscored</b> the lesions.

January though it was, the mild stillness seemed to vibrate with faint midsummer sounds. Rowland sat {{listening}} to them and wishing that, {{for the sake of his}} own felicity, Roderick's temper were graced with a certain absent ductility. He was brilliant, but was he, like many brilliant things, brittle? Suddenly, to his musing sense, the soft atmospheric hum was <b>overscored</b> with distincter sounds. He heard voices beyond a mass of shrubbery, at the turn of a neighboring path. In a moment one of them began to seem familiar, and an instant later a large white poodle emerged into view. He was slowly followed by his mistress. Miss Light paused a moment on seeing Rowland and his companion; but, though the former perceived that he was recognized, she made no bow. Presently she walked directly toward him. He rose and was on the point of waking Roderick, but she laid her finger on her lips and motioned him to forbear. She stood a moment looking at Roderick's handsome slumber.|$|R
40|$|With {{the aim of}} {{determining}} normal reference values for our sleep laboratory and evaluating the reliability of automated analysis for scoring polysomnographic studies in children, we recorded polysomnograms in 16 healthy boarding-school children. Sleep recordings were obtained with a computer system (Medilog SAC, Oxford Instruments). Polysomnographic variables were monitored continuously on a 16 -channel recorder equipped with a video. Data were acquired on optical disk for computer-assisted data interpretation. Sleep stages and respiratory events were also scored visually by operator. Comparison with visual scores showed that the computer system significantly <b>overscored</b> wakefulness (W) (p< 0. 02) and stage IV (p< 0. 001) and underscored stage II (p< 0. 001) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep (p< 0. 001). It also assigned respiratory events a higher score than did visual scoring, {{as shown by the}} higher apnoea index (AI) and hypopnoea index (HI) (AI p< 0. 03; HI p< 0. 001). Regression analysis showed a significant correlation between visual and automated scores for central (r= 0. 679; p< 0. 004) and obstructive apnoea (r= 0. 631; p< 0. 008). Computer apnoea scores did not correlate with visual scores. Much remains to be done before computer-based scoring systems can be relied upon, without visual scoring, for polysomnographic sleep studies in children. Their main advantage at present is that they offer a convenient means of saving paper, space and time...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to define the most useful index of expressing {{bronchodilator}} response and to distinguish between asthma and COPD. A prospective study was carried out of bronchodilator response in 142 asthmatics and 58 COPD patients in a university hospital. Reversibility was expressed as: 1. absolute change (Δabs); 2. % of initial (Δ%init); 3. % of predicted (Δ%pred) and 4. % of maximum possible response (Δ%max). Dependence on forced expirations volume in 1 sec (FEV 1) as % of predicted and sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of asthma were established. A relationship between Δabs and initial FEV 1 was not found in asthma (Δabs vs. % initial FEV 1. r = 0 · 07) or COPD (r = 0 · 02). Δ%pred did not show a correlation in asthma (r = 0 · 10) or COPD (r = 0 · 06). Δ%init was dependent on the baseline value in asthma (r = 0 · 38, P ≤ 0 · 001) but not in COPD (r = 0 · 18, P = n. s.). Δmax was dependent in both. The combination of best sensitivity and specificity to separate asthma and COPD was obtained with Δabs (70 · 4 or 70 · 6 %). The worst specificity for asthma diagnosis was obtained with Δ% init (50 %). The best likelihood ratios were obtained with Δabs and Δ%pred and the worst likelihood ratio with Δ%initΔ%init is not recommended as an index for differential diagnosis between asthma and COPD; 2) Δ%init <b>overscores</b> bronchodilator response in patients with low FEV 1. The independence of each bronchodilator response index should be verified in clinical trials for each selected sample...|$|R
6000|$|I {{observed}} {{that his name}} was carded upon three state-rooms; and, upon again referring {{to the list of}} passengers, I found that he had engaged passage for himself, wife, and two sisters--his own. The state-rooms were sufficiently roomy, and each had two berths, one above the other. These berths, to be sure, were so exceedingly narrow as to be insufficient for more than one person; still, I could not comprehend why there were three state-rooms for these four persons. I was, just at that epoch, in one of those moody frames of mind which make a man abnormally inquisitive about trifles: and I confess, with shame, that I busied myself in a variety of ill-bred and preposterous conjectures about this matter of the supernumerary state-room. It was no business of mine, to be sure, but with none the less pertinacity did I occupy myself in attempts to resolve the enigma. At last I reached a conclusion which wrought in me great wonder why I had not arrived at it before. [...] "It is a servant of course," [...] I said; [...] "what a fool I am, not sooner to have thought of so obvious a solution!" [...] And then I again repaired to the list--but here I saw distinctly that no servant was to come with the party, although, in fact, it had been the original design to bring one--for the words [...] "and servant" [...] had been first written and then <b>overscored.</b> [...] "Oh, extra baggage, to be sure," [...] I now said to myself--"something he wishes not to be put in the hold--something to be kept under his own eye--ah, I have it--a painting or so--and this is what he has been bargaining about with Nicolino, the Italian Jew." [...] This idea satisfied me, and I dismissed my curiosity for the nonce.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Nomograms are {{statistical}} models designed to maximize predictive accuracy. We have tested the statistical {{correlation between the}} predictions of International Bladder Cancer Nomogram Consortium and the clinical outcomes in a multicenter Italian cohort of patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC) and pelvic lymph-nodes dissection. Methods and materials: Two hundred four patients who underwent RC were selected for multiple variable and then enrolled in the study. Patients were tested by the "online tool" based on the nomogram, then stratified and risk grouped for 5 -year predicted disease-free survival (pDFS) : low risk (67 %- 100 %), intermediate risk (34 %- 66 %), and high risk group (0 %- 33 %). Receiving operating characteristic curve (ROC) quantified the area under curve (AUC) as predictive accuracy. Actual overall survival (aOS) and actual disease-free survival (aDFS) were calculated with Kaplan-Meyer analysis. Median of pDFS was compared with 5 -year aDFS. Results: AUC was 0. 69 (P < 0. 001). The aOS is 50 % (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI, - 7. 68 /+ 8. 23) at 5 -years after RC, the aDFS is 65. 5 % (95 % CI, - 7. 56 /+ 8. 98). The 5 -year aDFS is 75. 3 % (- 8. 82 /+ 12. 53) in low risk group; 67. 3 % (- 12 /+ 16. 4) in intermediate risk group; 28. 3 % (- 20 /+ 17. 2) in high risk group. The 5 -year aDFS was well calculated by the nomogram but in all groups the nomogram slightly underestimated the prediction. In intermediate risk group, 5 -year aDFS <b>overscored</b> both the nomogram pDFS and the pDFS range of this group (34 %- 66 %). In all patients investigated, the pDFS was 65 %, a value close to the 5 -year aDFS found (65. 6 %). Conclusion: Statistical correlation between postoperative nomogram prediction and the clinical reality was observed. © 2011...|$|R
60|$|Union Square was a {{different}} matter, though with the element there also that I made out that I didn't make out (my sense of drama was in this case, I think, rather more frightened off than led on;) a drawback for which, however, I consoled myself by baked apples and custards, an inveterate feature of our Sunday luncheon there (those of weekdays being various and casual) and by a study of a great store, as it seemed to me, of steel-plated volumes, devoted mainly to the heroines of Romance, with one in particular, presenting those of Shakespeare, in which the plates were so artfully coloured and varnished, and complexion and dress thereby so endeared to memory, that it was for long afterwards a shock {{to me at the}} theatre not to see just those bright images, with their peculiar toggeries, come on. I was able but the other day, moreover, to renew almost on the very spot the continuity of contemplation; large lumpish presences, precarious creations of a day, seemed to have elbowed out of the Square all but {{one or two of the}} minor monuments, pleasant appreciable things, of the other time; yet close to University Place the old house of the picture-books and the custards and the domestic situation had, though disfigured and <b>overscored,</b> not quite received its death-stroke; I disengaged, by a mere identification of obscured window and profaned portico, a whole chapter of history; which fact should indeed be a warning to penetration, a practical plea here for the superficial--by its exhibition of the rate at which the relations of any gage of experience multiply and ramify from the moment the mind begins to handle it. I pursued a swarm of such relations, on the occasion I speak of, up and down West Fourteenth Street and over to Seventh Avenue, running most of them to earth with difficulty, but finding them at half a dozen points quite confess to a queer stale sameness. The gage of experience, as I say, had in these cases been strangely spared--the sameness had in two or three of them held out as with conscious craft. But these are impressions I shall presently find it impossible not to take up again at any cost.|$|R

Let these few words, therefore, not anticipate the deluge--let them only express to you afresh my grateful sense of the interest and success of our excursion. The whole wonder of it was the greater through my wholly unprepared state, my antecedent inward blank--which blank is now <b>overscored</b> with images and emotions as thick as any page of any of your hospitable house-books ever was with visitors' names. The man himself made the place more wonderful and the place the man. I was greatly affected by his courtesy and charm; and I got afterwards, in the evening, a little of the light that I couldn't snatch from you under his nose. What struck me most about the whole thing was the consummate cleverness: that was the note it sounded for me more than any one of the notes more imposing, more deep, that an artistic creation may throw out. Don't for the world--and for my ruin--ever breathe to him I have said it; but the whole thing, and his taste, are far too Germanic, too Teutonic, a business to make a medium in which I could ever sink down in final peace or take as the domestic and decorative last word. The element of France and Italy are too much out of it--and they, to me, are the real secret of Style. But we will talk of these things--heaven speed the day. Do have a little of France {{and a great deal of}} Italy at South Wraxall; but do have also a great deal of the cunning Kempe and of the candid--too candid--companion of your pilgrimage. Don't imagine the companion didn't have a most sweet and glorious day--from which the light, even in London dusk again, has not yet wholly faded. I hope your security was complete to the end, and I am, in earnest hope also of a speedy reunion, yours, dear Lady Wolseley, more gratefully, if possible, than ever, ...|$|R
6000|$|They were at {{this period}} extravagantly and preternaturally fond of me; which, after all, I could reflect, {{was no more}} than a graceful {{response}} in children perpetually bowed over and hugged. The homage of which they were so lavish succeeded, in truth, for my nerves, quite as well as if I never appeared to myself, as I may say, literally to catch them at a purpose in it. They had never, I think, wanted to do so many things for their poor protectress; I mean--though they got their lessons better and better, which was naturally what would please her most--in the way of diverting, entertaining, surprising her; reading her passages, telling her stories, acting her charades, pouncing out at her, in disguises, as animals and historical characters, and above all astonishing her by the [...] "pieces" [...] they had secretly got by heart and could interminably recite. I should never get to the bottom--were I to let myself go even now--of the prodigious private commentary, all under still more private correction, with which, in these days, I <b>overscored</b> their full hours. They had shown me from the first a facility for everything, a general faculty which, taking a fresh start, achieved remarkable flights. They got their little tasks as if they loved them, and indulged, from the mere exuberance of the gift, in the most unimposed little miracles of memory. They not only popped out at me as tigers and as Romans, but as Shakespeareans, astronomers, and navigators. This was so singularly the case that it had presumably much to do with the fact as to which, at the present day, I am at a loss for a different explanation: I allude to my unnatural composure on the subject of another school for Miles. What I remember is that I was content not, for the time, to open the question, and that contentment must have sprung from the sense of his perpetually striking show of cleverness. He was too clever for a bad governess, for a parson's daughter, to spoil; and the strangest if not the brightest thread in the pensive embroidery I just spoke of was the impression I might have got, if I had dared to work it out, that he was under some influence operating in his small intellectual life as a tremendous incitement.|$|R
60|$|A {{thousand}} unuttered thoughts hummed {{for him in}} the air {{of these}} observations; not the least frequent of which was that Sarah might well of a truth not quite know whither she was drifting. She was in no position not to appear to expect that Chad should treat her handsomely; yet she struck our friend as privately stiffening a little each time she missed the chance of marking the great nuance. The great nuance was in brief that of course her brother must treat her handsomely--she should like to see him not; but that treating her handsomely, none the less, wasn't all in all--treating her handsomely buttered no parsnips; and that in fine there were moments when she felt the fixed eyes of their admirable absent mother fairly screw into the flat of her back. Strether, watching, after his habit, and <b>overscoring</b> with thought, positively had moments of his own in which he found himself sorry for her--occasions on which she affected him as a person seated in a runaway vehicle and turning over the question of a possible jump. WOULD she jump, could she, would THAT be a safe placed--this question, at such instants, sat for him in her lapse into pallor, her tight lips, her conscious eyes. It came back to the main point at issue: would she be, after all, to be squared? He believed on the whole she would jump; yet his alternations on this subject were the more especial stuff of his suspense. One thing remained well before him--a conviction that was in fact to gain sharpness from the impressions of this evening: that if she SHOULD gather in her skirts, close her eyes and quit the carriage while in motion, he would promptly enough become aware. She would alight from her headlong course more or less directly upon him; it would be appointed to him, unquestionably, to receive her entire weight. Signs and portents of the experience thus in reserve for him had as it happened, multiplied even through the dazzle of Chad's party. It was partly under the nervous consciousness of such a prospect that, leaving almost every one in the two other rooms, leaving those of the guests already known to him as well as a mass of brilliant strangers of both sexes and of several varieties of speech, he had desired five quiet minutes with little Bilham, whom he always found soothing and even a little inspiring, and to whom he had actually moreover something distinct and important to say.|$|R
