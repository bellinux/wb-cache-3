40|$|The {{sterling}} effective {{exchange rate}} depreciated by around 25 % between mid- 2007 and early 2009. That has encouraged a shift towards UK exports {{and away from}} imports, contributing to a significant narrowing in the United Kingdom’s real trade deficit. This article explains these developments in more detail. It shows that the depreciation has induced considerable switching of expenditure by overseas companies and households towards UK goods exports, and by UK residents away from travel services imports. But financial services exports appear to have suffered from the financial crisis. And there {{seems to have been}} less of a response to the exchange rate depreciation in <b>other</b> <b>services</b> <b>exports</b> and non-travel imports.

Value-added surpluses in trade and transport (21) were significantly larger than gross surpluses. Moreover, {{the balance in}} <b>other</b> <b>services</b> (22) was positive in value-added terms while it was negative in gross terms. This reversal was due to indirect <b>exports</b> of <b>other</b> <b>services</b> through <b>exports</b> of manufactured goods. Six Japanese manufacturing sectors had larger value-added surpluses than gross ones. They were pulp, paper and printing (7), chemical products (8), petroleum and petroleum products (9), rubber products (10), non-metallic mineral products (11), and metals and metal products (12). Their surpluses were not large but not negligible either.

In this context, the experience of the Indian economy is particularly instructive. Although some empirical studies have supported the view that FDI inflows in the Indian economy have not been export-oriented, {{it is important to note}} that none of these have studied the impact of FDI inflows on <b>service</b> <b>exports,</b> in spite of service sector emerging as a key driver of India's export growth.
