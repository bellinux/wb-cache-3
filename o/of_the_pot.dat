He reached the final <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pot</b> Black, where he was defeated by Doherty. In the Grand Prix, he reached the semi-finals, where he lost 5–6 against Ronnie O'Sullivan, despite leading 5–2. Further semi-finals followed at the Northern Ireland Trophy and the UK Championship, where he was defeated on both occasions by Maguire, 5–6 and 5–9, respectively, making it three consecutive semi-final losses. Before the UK Championship, he was provisionally ranked number one. He successfully defended his Malta Cup title (that year the tournament was not a ranking event) with a 9–3 victory over Doherty in the final. In the China Open, he defeated Selby 6–3 in the semi-final—his sixth semi-final {{in the past seven}} ranking events—but lost 9–10 to Maguire in the final. Before the World Championship, he was again provisional number one.|$|E

25|$|Acoma pottery {{dates back}} to more than 1,000 years ago. Dense local clay, dug up at a nearby site, is {{essential}} to Acoma pottery. The clay is dried and strengthened {{by the addition of}} pulverized pottery shards. The pieces then are shaped, painted, and fired. Geometric patterns, thunderbirds, and rainbows are traditional designs, which are applied with the spike of a yucca. Upon completion, a potter would lightly strike the side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> and hold it to their ear. If the pot does not ring, then the pot will crack during firing. If this was found, the piece would be destroyed and ground into shards for future use.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{eventual}} {{termination of the}} supply of manna, Exodus states that {{a small amount of}} it survived within an omer-sized pot or jar, which was kept facing the Testimony (possibly, adjacent to the Ark of the Covenant); it indicates that God instructed this of Moses, who delegated it to Aaron. The Epistle to the Hebrews states that the pot was stored inside the Ark. Classical rabbinical sources believe the pot was made of gold; some say it was only there for the generation following Moses, and others that it survived at least until the time of Jeremiah. However, the First Book of Kings states that it was absent earlier than Jeremiah, during Solomon's reign in the tenth century B.C. Form critics attribute the mention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> to the Priestly tradition, concluding that the pot existed in the early sixth century B.C.|$|E
25|$|No-limit hold 'em {{has grown}} in {{popularity}} and is the form most commonly found in televised tournament poker and is the game played in the main event of the World Series of Poker. In no-limit hold 'em, players may bet or raise any amount over the minimum raise up {{to all of the}} chips the player has at the table (called an all-in bet). The minimum raise is equal {{to the size of the}} previous bet or raise. If someone wishes to re-raise, they must raise at least the amount of the previous raise. For example, if the big blind is $2 and there is a raise of $6 to a total of $8, a re-raise must be at least $6 more for a total of $14. If a raise or re-raise is all-in and does not equal the size of the previous raise (or half the size in some casinos), the initial raiser cannot re-raise again (in case there are other players also still in the game). In pot-limit hold 'em, the maximum raise is the current size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> (including the amount needed to call).|$|E

500|$|Cawl, {{pronounced}} {{in a similar}} way to the English word [...] "cowl", can be regarded as Wales' national dish. Dating back to the 11th century, originally it was a simple broth of meat (most likely bacon) and vegetables, it could be cooked slowly {{over the course of the}} day whilst the family was out working the fields. It could be made in stages, over a number of days, first by making a meat stock, then by adding the vegetables on the following day. Once cooked, the fat could be skimmed from the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot,</b> then it would be served as two separate dishes, first as a soup, then as a stew. Leftovers could be topped up with fresh vegetables, sometimes over the course of weeks. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the amount of meat used in the broth was minimal; instead it was bulked out with potatoes. Today, cawl would be much more likely to include beef or lamb for the meat, and may be served with plain oatmeal dumplings or currant dumplings known as trollies. Traditionally cawl would be eaten with a [...] "specially-carved wooden spoon" [...] and eaten from a wooden bowl.|$|E
500|$|Former {{president}} of the Czech Republic and writer Václav Havel characterized the phrase among [...] "commonly canonized demagogical tricks." [...] The Economist popularized the term whataboutism in a 2008 article, for the repeated usage of this rhetorical tactic by the Soviet Union. The magazine wrote that the tactic became overused, {{and by the time}} of the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union, it had become a figure of speech referring to the entirety of Soviet propaganda. The book Exit from Communism edited by Stephen Richards Graubard made a similar point, that the term encapsulated an overall divorce from reality: [...] "Perhaps there are and perhaps there are not prison camps in Siberia, perhaps in the United States they do or perhaps they do not lynch blacks... Ultimately it does not matter whether we are for real or just pretending: it is all just part of the story." [...] With the election of Barack Obama as U.S. president in 2008, The New York Times reported that the tactic could see decreased usage: [...] "In Russia, for example, where Soviet leaders used to respond to any American criticism of human rights violation with 'But you hang Negroes,' analysts note that the election of Mr. Obama removes a stain." [...] Journalist George Feifer recounted in a 2009 article how when he traveled to Moscow in 1959 to cover the American National Exhibition, he faced those using the phrase against him. Feifer wrote: [...] "Skilled propagandists stationed among the listeners regularly interrupted to repeat questions intended to discredit me. Why did America tolerate shameful poverty and lynch Negroes?" [...] In 2011, author Michael Dobson wrote that the phrase was a form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pot</b> calling the kettle black, and a [...] "famous example" [...] of the tu quoque reasoning derived from a [...] "famous 1960s era Russian joke." ...|$|E
