5|$|A 113-page guidebook titled To Heart 2: Master Guide was {{published}} by MediaWorks on January 15, 2005. The book contains poster artwork, the 'face patterns' of each character, selected CG scenes and a guide on how to play through each character's scenarios. Voice actress interviews are also included, {{as well as a}} brief guide on how to play through each scenario in To Heart. This was followed by another 192-page guidebook for the visual novel titled The Essence <b>of</b> <b>To</b> Heart 2: To Heart 2 Official Guidebook, which {{was published}} by Enterbrain on March 4, 2005. The book contains detailed character descriptions, a complete walk through to every heroine in the game, computer graphics, and interviews with the game's development staff. Enterbrain also released a 223-page guidebook entitled The Essence <b>of</b> <b>To</b> Heart 2 Portable: To Heart 2 Portable Official Guidebook for the PlayStation Portable version of the game on August 18, 2009. The guidebook is based on the original Essence for the PlayStation 2 game, but contained new and revised content for the PSP version. A guidebook for the PSP spinoff To Heart 2: Dungeon Travelers, named To Heart 2: Dungeon Travelers Official Complete Guide, was released by Enterbrain on August 11, 2011.|$|E

5|$|Ain't is a {{contraction}} for am not, is not, are not, has not, {{and have}} not in the common English language vernacular.

40|$|Five {{retrotransposon}} families <b>of</b> rice (<b>Tos</b> 1 -Tos 5) {{have been}} reported previously. Here we report 15 new retrotransposon families <b>of</b> rice (<b>Tos</b> 6 -Tos 20). In contrast to yeast and Drosophila retrotransposons, all of the rice retrotransposons examined appear inactive (or almost inactive) under normal growth conditions. Three of the rice retrotransposons (Tos 10, Tos 17, and Tos 19) are activated under tissue culture conditions. The most active one, Tos 17, was studied in detail. The copy number <b>of</b> <b>Tos</b> 17 increased with prolonged culture period. In all of the plants regenerated from tissue cultures, including transgenic plants, 5 to 30 transposed Tos 17 copies were detected. The transcript <b>of</b> <b>Tos</b> 17 was only detected under tissue culture conditions, indicating that the transposition <b>of</b> <b>Tos</b> 17 is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. To examine the target-site specificity <b>of</b> <b>Tos</b> 17 transposition, sequences flanking transposed Tos 17 copies were analyzed. At least four out of eight target sites examined are coding regions. Other target sites may also be in genes because two out of four were transcribed. The regenerated plants with Tos 17 -insertions in the phytochrome A gene and the S-receptor kinase-related gene were identified. These results indicate that activation <b>of</b> <b>Tos</b> 17 is an important cause of tissue culture-induced mutations. Tissue culture-induced activation <b>of</b> <b>Tos</b> 17 may be {{a useful tool for}} insertional mutagenesis and functional analysis of genes...|$|R

The songwriting and production <b>of</b> <b>To</b> Record Only Water for Ten Days were more efficient and straightforward than on his previous recordings. The album strayed from the alternative rock he had just written with the Chili Peppers on Californication, focusing more on electronic and new wave elements.
