40|$|The {{need for}} {{maintaining}} a lower specific engine <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> {{is essential in}} enhancing the longevity of the oil and of the engine and its components. By decreasing the engine <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> the <b>oil</b> is able to perform its job more efficiently. It is proposed to use the carbon foam, with its exceptional thermal management capabilities, to aid in reducing and stabilizing the engine <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> during steady state operation. Also, {{it is possible to}} use the carbon foam to heat the engine oil during startup to reduce emissions and possibly engine wear. The mesophase pitch derived carbon foam, developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is a material that offers excellent thermal management capability. The foam has an open cell structure (0. 98 fraction open porosity) with graphitic ligaments aligned parallel to the cell walls. The alignment of the graphitic ligaments in a three dimensional array gives the foam homogeneous thermal properties, unlike graphite fibers. The bulk thermal conductivity of the foam has been measured to be 175 W/m{center_dot}K, placing it on the level of 6061 aluminum, which has a bulk thermal conductivity of 180 W/m{center_dot}K. Copper has a bulk thermal conductivity over two times higher, at 400 W/m{center_dot}K. The proposed research will entail using the carbon foam, with its excellent thermal management capabilities, as a cooling and heating medium for engine oil, or in other words an <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> regulator. The foam will aid in maintaining a specific <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> during steady state operation and in heating of the engine oil at startup. Being able to maintain a consistent <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> will ensure better operation of engine oil, by extending the life of the oil and engine.

In present study, a gear {{transmission}} system {{was used to evaluate}} the effects of oil viscosity, speed, <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> as well as the applied load on torque efficiency. The experimental results reveal that the efficiency is increased with the increasing <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> and/or applied load whether the multigrade or singlegrade oil was employed. Under a constant torgue, the power loss is increased with the increasing pitch line velocity. The above characteristic resulting from the use of high-viscosity oil yields the substantial variations.

To {{determine}} the cause of high <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> of the bearings in a kiln, oil samples extracted from the recovery of lubricant oil and were tested by comprehensive oil analytical techniques (including conventional physical and chemical Analysis, pollution degree detection and ferrography wear particle analysis).
