2500|$|Doughty's {{intention}} {{with the}} book was to combine [...] "memoir, science, and manifesto" [...] in an entertaining way that would attract a wide readership to the unpleasant topics of death, decay, and corpse handling, in order to challenge the reader to confront their own mortality.

Why shouldn't I be known to be doing it? You know, why shouldn't I get the credit for something that I'm actually doing?' So I just basically did it, and I didn't tell anybody, whereas the process before was, I would tell people that I was getting ready to do it, then we would gear up to do it, and then people would get involved, and the credit would go wherever. So I just didn't tell a single soul I was doing it, I just did it in my own studio, and it was great." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Duff, {{the album}} chronicles her {{experiences}} {{over the year}} before its release: [...] "some of its good, {{and some of its}} bad, and a lot of its, like, a big learning experience", she explained. She expressed an interest in recording lyrically more aggressive material ("Well, I'm not going to be singing about lollipops because I no longer relate to lollipops") than the songs on Metamorphosis (2003) and wanted the album to reflect that, according to her, she is a normal sixteen-year-old. [...] "Basically, I'm not Lizzie McGuire anymore", she said. She said the album deals with issues she would not discuss publicly and provides [...] "some answers", but she disagreed with people who believed the album presented a different side of her, saying [...] "I think it's just more me this time because I got to really do it how I wanted to." [...] Duff called the album [...] "different [...] " [...] Metamorphosis and [...] "much more mature", particularly in its [...] "sound", but not {{to the point where it}} would be inappropriate for children; [...] "I just think that <b>other</b> <b>people</b> <b>will</b> relate better", she said.

40|$|The suspect {{classification}} {{approach as}} it pertains to women, racial minorities, and the poor will be analyzed first in order to determine what gains, if any, have been achieved and lost via this route.

Finally, the value of a 2 ̆ 2 sliding-scale 2 ̆ 2 route to equal protection issues as a route which might permit the oppressed to present a more reasoned equal protection package to the Court, and simultaneously make it more uncomfortable for the Supreme Court to disregard the societal injustices heaped upon the poor, racial minorities, and <b>other</b> oppressed <b>peoples,</b> <b>will</b> be considered...|$|R
