5|$|The willie wagtail is insectivorous {{and spends}} much time chasing prey in open habitat. Its common name {{is derived from}} its habit of wagging its tail {{horizontally}} when foraging on the ground. Aggressive and territorial, the willie wagtail will often harass much larger birds such as the laughing kookaburra and wedge-tailed eagle. It has responded well to human alteration of the landscape and is a common sight in urban lawns, parks, and gardens. It was widely featured in Aboriginal folklore around the country as either a bringer <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> or a stealer of secrets.|$|E
5|$|Although {{preliminary}} {{reports from}} Reuters suggested an Oblivion release {{in tandem with}} the launch of the Xbox 360 on November 22, 2005, and the original announcement of the game set a release date of Winter 2005, Take-Two Interactive announced, during a conference call with analysts on October 31, 2005, that Oblivions release was to be delayed until the second quarter of Take-Two's fiscal year. The new schedule would put the release between February and April 2006. The delay surprised many, especially online retailers, who had begun accepting pre-orders for consoles bundled with Oblivion.

We argue that to the extent that managers delay reporting <b>bad</b> <b>news,</b> this leads to <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> being more concentrated. Measuring flows <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> and good <b>news</b> using flows of negative and positive abnormal stock returns, we find that firms with higher volatility of operations and managerial incentives to withhold <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> exhibit relatively more concentrated <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> flows. This relative concentration is also positively associated with lower earnings quality and a higher risk of shareholder litigation. Our results suggest that the relative concentration <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> and good <b>news</b> flows is related {{to the quality of the}} firm’s information environment...|$|R

40|$|AIMS: To {{explore the}} {{difficulties}} experienced by nurses and healthcare professionals when {{engaging in the}} process <b>of</b> breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> BACKGROUND: The challenges faced by staff when breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> have previously been researched in relation to particular settings or subjects. This study involved staff from diverse settings and roles to develop broader insights into the range of difficulties experienced in clinical practice. DESIGN: The study used a descriptive survey design involving self-reported written accounts and framework analysis. METHODS: Data were collected using a structured questionnaire containing a free text section that asked participants to describe a difficult experience they had encountered when {{involved in the process}} <b>of</b> breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Data were collected from healthcare staff from hospital, community, hospice and care home settings attending training days on breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> between April 2011 - April 2014. FINDINGS: Multiple inter-related factors presented challenges to staff engaging in activities associated with breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> Traditional subjects such as diagnostic and treatment information were described but additional topics were identified such as the impact of illness and care at the end of life. A descriptive framework was developed that summarises the factors that contribute to creating difficult experiences for staff when breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> CONCLUSION: The framework provides insights into the scope of the challenges faced by staff when they engage in the process <b>of</b> breaking <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> This provides the foundation for developing interventions to support staff that more closely matches their experiences in clinical practice.

500|$|The willie wagtail was {{a feature}} in Australian Aboriginal folklore. Aboriginal tribes {{in parts of}} southeastern Australia, such as the Ngarrindjeri of the Lower Murray River, and the Narrunga People of the Yorke Peninsula, regard the willie wagtail as the bearer <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news.</b> It was thought that the willie wagtail could steal a person's secrets while {{lingering}} around camps eavesdropping, so women would be tight-lipped {{in the presence of}} the bird. The people of the Kimberley held a similar belief that it would inform the spirit of the recently departed if living relatives spoke badly of them. They also venerated the willie wagtail as the most intelligent of all animals. Its cleverness is also seen in a Tinputz tale of Bougainville Island, where Singsing Tongereng (Willie Wagtail) wins a contest among all birds to see who can fly the highest, by riding on the back of the eagle. However, the Gunwinggu in western Arnhem Land took a dimmer view and regarded it as a liar and a [...] The willie wagtail was held to have stolen fire and tried to extinguish it in the sea in a dreaming story of the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara, and was able to send a strong wind if frightened.

His other 2011 summer camps included Pittsburgh Jam Fest, the National Basketball Players Association Top 100 camp and the Under Armour Best of the Best Camp, where he was the most valuable player. Also in August, ESPN reported that McGary had narrowed his list of schools to six: University of Florida, University of Maryland, University of North Carolina, University of Michigan, Duke University and University of Kentucky. Because McGary does not like to be the bearer <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news,</b> when he narrowed his list, he had his father contact the coaches of the teams no longer in contention for his services. McGary scheduled his official Michigan visit for the beginning of September. McGary completed his official campus visits to University of Michigan, University of North Carolina, and Duke University, in that order, by October 4. [...] However, due to injuries suffered a few weeks earlier while shattering the backboard, he only played pick-up games at Duke. He also made an unofficial visit to Florida prior to these official visits.

Although he had a productive and successful academic career behind him, he was disappointed that his work had not received the dissemination and recognition he had expected for {{it in his own}} lifetime.

As he likened himself to one unlucky heretic and legendary martyr of science out of the Italian Renaissance, Georgescu grumbled and exclaimed: [...] "E pur si muove is ordinarily attributed to Galileo, although those words were the last ones uttered by Giordano Bruno on the burning stake!"

Nine articles were included using the selection flow chart. A digital form was completed for each article according to the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research checklist and the level of scientific evidence was determined. Results: Of the 99 articles in identified, nine were included after applying the selection flowchart.

Conclusion: the approach and skills of the nurse during this task influences the patient’s reaction to the message. The theme is scarce in the literature and merits further investigation...|$|R
2500|$|Jeff Lynne {{wanted to}} follow Time {{with a double}} album, but CBS blocked his plan {{on the grounds that}} a double vinyl album would be too {{expensive}} in the oil crisis and as a result, the new album was edited down from double album to a single disc and released as Secret Messages in 1983 (many of the out-takes were later released on Afterglow or as b-sides of singles). The album was a hit in the UK reaching the top 5; but its release was undermined by a string <b>of</b> <b>bad</b> <b>news</b> {{that there would be no}} tour to promote the LP, as drummer Bevan was now playing drums for Black Sabbath and bassist Groucutt had left the band during the recording of the album (leaving Lynne to once again record many of the bass parts). Rumours of the group disbanding were publicly denied by Bevan and although Secret Messages debuted at number four in the United Kingdom, it fell off the charts, failing to catch fire with a lack of hit singles in the UK (though [...] "Rock 'n' Roll Is King" [...] was a sizeable hit in UK, the US and Australia) and a lukewarm media response. By 1983 Bevan was expressing a desire to join Black Sabbath permanently and Lynne and Tandy were recording tracks for the Electric Dreams soundtrack under Lynne's name; however, Lynne was contractually obliged to make one more ELO album. Lynne, Bevan and Tandy returned to the studio in 1985 as a three-piece (with Christian Schneider playing saxophone on some tracks and Lynne again doubling on bass in addition to his usual guitar in the absence of an official bass player) to record Balance of Power, released early in 1986.
