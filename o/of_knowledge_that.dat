5|$|Instrumentalism {{became popular}} among {{physicists}} {{around the turn}} of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only testable statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces verificationism (a set of theories <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> combines logicism, empiricism, and linguistics to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the empirical sciences). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new scientific philosophy, the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.|$|E
25|$|The {{historical}} {{development of the}} work of anthropologists seems to single out clearly a domain <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> heretofore has not been treated by any other science. It is the biological history of mankind in all its varieties; linguistics applied to people without written languages; the ethnology of people without historic records; and prehistoric archeology.|$|E
25|$|Two {{common types}} of toss-ups include buzzer-beaters and {{pyramidal}} tossups. Buzzer-beaters (also known as speed check or quick-recall questions) are relatively short, rarely {{more than two}} sentences long, and contain few clues. This type of question is written specifically to test quick recall skills of players, and does not discriminate the different levels <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> the players possess.|$|E

25|$|Hydro{{meteorology}} is {{the branch}} of meteorology that deals with the hydrologic cycle, the water budget, and the rainfall statistics of storms. A hydrometeorologist prepares and issues forecasts of accumulating (quantitative) precipitation, heavy rain, heavy snow, and highlights areas {{with the potential for}} flash flooding. Typically the range <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> is required overlaps with climatology, mesoscale and synoptic meteorology, and other geosciences.|$|E
25|$|A {{scientific}} revolution occurs, {{according to}} Kuhn, when scientists encounter anomalies that cannot {{be explained by}} the universally accepted paradigm within which scientific progress has thereto been made. The paradigm, in Kuhn's view, is not simply the current theory, but the entire worldview in which it exists, and all of the implications which come with it. This is based on features of landscape <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> scientists can identify around them.|$|E
25|$|By the 13th {{century the}} {{universities}} of Oxford and Paris had come up, and the scholars were now studying mathematics and philosophy with lesser worries about mundane chores of life—the fields {{were not as}} clearly demarcated {{as they are in}} the modern times. Of these, compendia and redactions, such as those of Johannes Campanus, of Euclid and Aristotle, confronted scholars with ideas about infinity and the ratio theory of elements as a means of expressing relations between various quantities involved with moving bodies. These studies led to a new body <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> is now known as physics.|$|E

25|$|Advocacy. Advocacy {{for health}} equity has been {{identified}} as a key means of promoting favourable policy change. EuroHealthNet carried out a systematic review of the academic and grey literature. It found, amongst other things, that certain kinds of evidence may be more persuasive in advocacy efforts, that practices associated with knowledge transfer and translation can increase the uptake <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> <b>that</b> there are many different potential advocates and targets of advocacy and that advocacy efforts need to be tailored according to context and target. As a result of its work, it produced an online advocacy for health equity toolkit.|$|E
25|$|Jung's staunchest {{critics have}} {{accused him of}} either mystical or metaphysical essentialism. Since archetypes are defined so vaguely and since archetypal images have been {{observed}} by many Jungians in a wide and essentially infinite variety of everyday phenomena, they are neither generalizable nor specific {{in a way that}} may be researched or demarcated with any kind of rigor. Hence they elude systematic study. Jung and his supporters defended the impossibility of providing rigorous operationalised definitions as a problem peculiar not only to archetypal psychology alone, but also other domains <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> seek to understand complex systems in an integrated manner.|$|E
25|$|Medicine {{in medieval}} Islam was {{an area of}} science that {{advanced}} particularly during the Abbasids' reign. During the 9th century, Baghdad contained over 800 doctors, and great discoveries {{in the understanding of}} anatomy and diseases were made. The clinical distinction between measles and smallpox was described during this time. Famous Persian scientist Ibn Sina (known to the West as Avicenna) produced treatises and works that summarized the vast amount <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> scientists had accumulated, and was very influential through his encyclopedias, The Canon of Medicine and The Book of Healing. The work of him and many others directly influenced the research of European scientists during the Renaissance.|$|E

25|$|Certain {{technological}} inventions of the period– {{whether of}} Arab or Chinese origin, or unique European innovations– {{were to have}} great influence on political and social developments, in particular gunpowder, the printing press and the compass. The introduction of gunpowder {{to the field of}} battle affected not only military organisation, but helped advance the nation state. Gutenberg's movable type printing press made possible not only the Reformation, but also a dissemination <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> would lead to a gradually more egalitarian society. The compass, along with other innovations such as the cross-staff, the mariner's astrolabe, and advances in shipbuilding, enabled the navigation of the World Oceans, and the early phases of colonialism. Other inventions had a greater impact on everyday life, such as eyeglasses and the weight-driven clock.|$|E
25|$|The {{interest}} of the Prophet Muḥammad in female education was manifest {{in the fact that}} he himself used to teach women along with men. Muḥammad's teachings were widely sought by both sexes, and accordingly {{at the time of his}} death it was reported that there were many female scholars of Islam. Additionally, the wives of the Prophet Muḥammadparticularly Aishaalso taught both women and men; many of Muḥammad's companions and followers learned the Qur'an, ḥadīth and Islamic jurisprudence (fiqh) from Aisha. Notably, there was no restriction placed on the type of knowledge acquired: a woman was free to choose any field <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> interested her. Because Islam recognises that women are in principle wives and mothers, the acquisition of knowledge in fields which are complementary to these social roles was specially emphasised.|$|E
25|$|Armstrong's view of {{knowledge}} is that the conditions {{of knowledge}} are satisfied {{when you have a}} justified true belief that you arrived at through a reliable process: that is, the belief was caused by some factor in the external world (hence the label of externalism). Armstrong uses the analogy of a thermometer: as a thermometer changes to reflect the temperature of the environment it is in, so must one's beliefs if they are reliably formed. The connection between knowledge and the external world, for Armstrong, is a nomological relationship (that is, a law of nature relationship). Here, Armstrong's view is broadly similar to that of Alvin Goldman and Robert Nozick. The intuitions that lead to this kind of externalism led Alvin Plantinga towards an account <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> added the requirement for 'properly-functioning' cognitive systems operating according to a design plan.|$|E

It was this theory <b>of</b> Innate <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> later led philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) to combat this theory <b>of</b> empiricism (<b>that</b> all <b>knowledge</b> is acquired through experience).|$|R

25|$|The 8 LMQs {{have two}} key purposes. Firstly, {{they act as}} a ‘professional {{knowledge}} organiser’. This means the 8 LMQs enable the teacher to identify and then organise the fundamental consideration, or elements, required for the successful development and execution of learning experiences, units of work or individual lessons. For the student-teacher the 8LMQs act as a ‘knowledge organiser’ whereby essential professional knowledge, learnt {{as part of their}} preparation program, is organised such they have a bank of ‘considerations’ that they can call upon as they engage with each question. By this is meant the teacher education program should be presented so as to inform each LMQ. This has the effect of providing the student-teacher with a ‘ready-reference’ arrangement <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> they can draw upon and unpack when designing and then executing successful learning experiences.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the nineteenth}} and early-twentieth century {{publications}} on Maya art and archaeology by Stephens, Catherwood, Maudslay, Maler and Charnay {{that for the first}} time made available reliable drawings and photographs of major Classic Maya monuments, the 1913 publication of Herbert Spinden´s 'A Study of Maya Art' - now over a century ago - laid the foundation for all later developments of Maya art history (including iconography). The book gives an analytical treatment of themes and motifs, particularly the ubiquitous serpent and dragon motifs, and a review of the ´material arts´, such as the composition of temple facades, roof combs and mask panels. Spinden's chronological treatment of Maya art was later (1950) refined by the motif analysis of the architect and specialist in archaeological drawing, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, in her book 'A Study of Classic Maya Sculpture'. Kubler's 1969 inventory of Maya iconography, containing a site-by-site treatment of 'commemorative' images and a topical treatment of ritual and mythical images (such as the 'triadic sign'), concluded a period of gradual increase <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> was soon to be overshadowed by new developments.|$|E
25|$|The Stackelberg and Cournot {{models are}} similar because in both {{competition}} is on quantity. However, as seen, {{the first move}} gives the leader in Stackelberg a crucial advantage. There is also the important assumption of perfect information in the Stackelberg game: the follower must observe the quantity chosen by the leader, otherwise the game reduces to Cournot. With imperfect information, the threats described above can be credible. If the follower cannot observe the leader's move, {{it is no longer}} irrational for the follower to choose, say, a Cournot level of quantity (in fact, that is the equilibrium action). However, it must be that there is imperfect information and the follower is unable to observe the leader's move because it is irrational for the follower not to observe if it can once the leader has moved. If it can observe, it will so that it can make the optimal decision. Any threat by the follower claiming that it will not observe even if it can is as uncredible as those above. This is an example of too much information hurting a player. In Cournot competition, it is the simultaneity of the game (the imperfection <b>of</b> <b>knowledge)</b> <b>that</b> results in neither player (ceteris paribus) being at a disadvantage.|$|E

25|$|The {{crew were}} kept in {{separate}} cells in a well guarded wooden prison. During the imprisonment, the Japanese began interrogating the officers with many precise questions, revealing the lack <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>that</b> both cultures had for the other. On 25 August, the commander brought Golovnin his personal wares from his cabin on the Diana, much to his surprise, but the Diana had not been captured but had simply sent these items ashore. He was later brought before the governor of Hokkaido and made to discuss the events that took place by Resanov and Chwostoff. The governor handed him {{a letter from the}} remaining officers of the Diana who explained why they were not able to save them in the Kurils and that they would work towards their release. Golovnin was also provided with another letter written in 1806 by Chwostoff, stating that he had annexed the island of Sakhalin {{in the name of the}} Tsar. The Japanese had also annexed Sakhalin in 1807 in fear of growing Russian interference. The letter convinced many of the Japanese that Golovnin was a Russian spy. The Japanese continued pressing questions to Golovnin and he and the crew were moved to a new prison in Matsumae.|$|E
500|$|Rather than teach {{small parts}} {{of a large number}} of subjects, Whitehead {{advocated}} teaching a relatively few important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge, discovering their application in actual life.
