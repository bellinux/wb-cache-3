25|$|The major {{research}} on strong reducibilities {{has been to}} compare their theories, both for the class of all recursively enumerable sets {{as well as for}} the class of all subsets of the natural numbers. Furthermore, the relations between the reducibilities has been studied. For example, it is known that every Turing degree is either a truth-table degree <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> union of infinitely many truth-table degrees.|$|E
25|$|In addition, a {{considerable}} number of mainly Late Cretaceous and Paleogene fossils have been described where it is uncertain {{whether or not they are}} anseriforms. This is because almost all orders of aquatic birds living today either originated or underwent a major radiation during that time, making it hard to decide whether some waterbird-like bone belongs into this family <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> product of parallel evolution in a different lineage due to adaptive pressures.|$|E
25|$|One {{might at}} first {{imagine that the}} economy of {{argument}} involved with the Kurgan solution should oblige us to accept it outright.

25|$|In normal bone, {{fractures}} {{occur when}} there is significant force applied, or repetitive trauma over a long time. Fractures can also occur when a bone is weakened, such as with osteoporosis, or {{when there is}} a structural problem, such as when the bone remodels excessively (such as Paget's disease) <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> site of the growth of cancer. Common fractures include wrist fractures and hip fractures, associated with osteoporosis, vertebral fractures associated with high-energy trauma and cancer, and fractures of long-bones. Not all fractures are painful. When serious, depending on the fractures type and location, complications may include flail chest, compartment syndromes or fat embolism.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the ethical}} {{questions}} that were new. Is GH not a wise use of finite healthcare resources, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> physician’s primary responsibility to the patient? If GH is given to most extremely short children to make them taller, will the definition of “extremely short” simply rise, negating the expected social benefit? If GH is given to short children whose parents can afford it, will shortness become a permanent mark of lower social origins? More of these issues are outlined in the ethics section. Whole meetings were devoted to these questions; pediatric endocrinology had become a specialty with its own bioethics issues.|$|E
25|$|In the reaction, {{sodium metal}} goes from an {{oxidation}} state of 0 (as it {{is a pure}} element) to +1: in other words, the sodium lost one electron and {{is said to have}} been oxidized. On the other hand, the chlorine gas goes from an oxidation of 0 (it is also a pure element) to −1: the chlorine gains one electron and {{is said to have been}} reduced. Because the chlorine is the one reduced, it is considered the electron acceptor, or in other words, induces oxidation in the sodium – thus the chlorine gas is considered the oxidizing agent. Conversely, the sodium is oxidized <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> electron donor, and thus induces reduction in the other species and is considered the reducing agent.|$|E

25|$|Metabolic {{syndrome}} – {{a poorly}} understood condition first called Syndrome X by Gerald Reaven. It is currently {{not clear whether}} the syndrome has a single, treatable cause, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> result of body changes leading to type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia (disturbances in blood cholesterol forms and other blood lipids), and increased waist circumference (at least in populations in much of the developed world). The basic underlying cause may be the insulin resistance that precedes type 2 diabetes, which is a diminished capacity for insulin response in some tissues (e.g., muscle, fat). It is common for morbidities such as essential hypertension, obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) to develop.|$|E
25|$|In series 2, another {{character}} was created, Gayle Shand, played by Tamsin Greig. Gayle {{was a former}} employee of Prentiss McCabe and Charles's former girlfriend, {{with whom she had}} a heavily sexual relationship (they often made love whilst listening to classical music). However, the relationship fell apart after Gayle told Charles that she was already married to an insect specialist from Philadelphia. She now runs a rival firm to Prentiss McCabe, which is a much larger company, and is often trying to win Archie's contract, <b>or</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> agent of a rival client to Prentiss McCabe's current one. For example, whilst Charles and Martin work for the PM via Archie, Gayle is the spin doctor for the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Prentiss McCabe always {{come up with a plan}} to keep Archie on their side, despite Gayle's attempts to stop them, even trying to make Charles a partner in her firm.|$|E
