Changes include revised bumpers, there is a chrome moulding above the number plate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> lid, refreshed alloy wheel designs and the Holden IQ system. Also the SSV model was introduced. The Holden Ute is sold as the Lumina Ute in South Africa.|$|E
5|$|The third {{source of}} over-provisioning comes from known free {{space on the}} drive, gaining {{endurance}} and performance {{at the expense of}} reporting unused portions, and/or at the expense of current or future capacity. This free space can be identified by the operating system using the TRIM command. Alternately, some SSDs provide a utility that permit the end user to select additional over-provisioning. Furthermore, if any SSD is set up with an overall partitioning layout smaller than 100% of the available space, that unpartitioned space will be automatically used by the SSD as over-provisioning as well. Yet another source of over-provisioning is operating system minimum free space limits; some operating systems maintain a certain minimum free space per drive, particularly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> or main drive. If this additional space can be identified by the SSD, perhaps through continuous usage of the TRIM command, then this acts as semi-permanent over-provisioning. Over-provisioning often takes away from user capacity, either temporarily or permanently, but it gives back reduced write amplification, increased endurance, and increased performance.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} boot loader {{appealing}} to other operating system developers, Apple added features to allow {{flexibility in the}} booting process such as network boot using TFTP and load Mach-O and ELF formatted kernels. BootX can also boot from HFS, HFS+, UFS and ext2 formatted volumes. The boot loader can be manipulated at startup by holding down various key combinations to alter the booting process. Such functions include Verbose Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and V key at startup, which replaces the default Apple logo with text-based information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> process and Single User Mode, achieved by holding down the Command and S, which, depending on the operating system, may boot into a more basic command-line or text-based version of the operating system, to facilitate maintenance and recovery action. The ROM can also be set to require a password to access these technical functions using the OpenFirmware interface.|$|E

25|$|Despite Android's popularity, {{including}} an activation rate {{three times that}} of iOS, {{there have been reports}} that Google {{has not been able to}} leverage their other products and web services successfully to turn Android into the money maker that analysts had expected. The Verge suggested that Google is losing control of Android due to the extensive customization and proliferation of non-Google apps and services Amazon's Kindle Fire line uses Fire OS, a heavily modified fork of Android which does not include or support any of Google's proprietary components, and requires that users obtain software from its competing Amazon Appstore instead of Play Store. In 2014, in an effort to improve prominence of the Android brand, Google began to require that devices featuring its proprietary components display an Android logo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> screen.|$|E

25|$|The {{left thumb}} alone {{operates}} nine keys: B1, B1, C1, D1, D4, C4 (also B4), two keys when combined create A4, and the whisper key. The whisper key {{should be held}} down for notes between and including F1 and G2 and certain other notes. Additional notes can be created with the left thumb keys. The D1 and bottom key above the whisper key on the tenor joint (C key) together create both C2 and C3. The same bottom tenor-joint key is also used, with additional fingering, to create E4 and F4. D4 and C4 together create C4. When the two keys on the tenor joint to create A4 are used with slightly altered fingering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> joint, B4 is created. The whisper key may also be used throughout the instrument's register, along with other fingerings, to produce either a more muted or more piercing sound.|$|E
25|$|The {{match was}} played in very English {{conditions}} – the wicket hardly differed foom the outfield, {{there was a}} near gale-force wind and it rained. Keith Boyce dismissed Gavaskar with the last ball of the first over. John Lever hit Jayantilal <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> with his first ball, had Wadekar caught behind off the fifth, and yorked Viswanath with the second ball of his second over. None of the batsmen scored and India was 3 for 4 after 20 balls. India eventually ended up with 164. In the Essex reply, Keith Fletcher scored his third hundred {{of the season in}} 223 minutes. Just before the declaration, Lever hit 37 in 25 minutes with 2 fours and 3 sixes. After reaching 163 for 3 an hour before tea on the final day, India lost five wickets in 20 overs. Essex needed 68 in 18 overs and managed it just in time.|$|E
25|$|The four {{fingers of}} the right hand {{have at least one}} {{assignment}} each. The index finger stays over one hole, except that when E4 is played a side key {{at the top of the}} boot is used. The middle finger remains stationary over the hole with a ring around it, and this ring and other pads are lifted when the smallest finger on the right hand pushes a lever. The ring finger typically remains stationary on the lower ring-finger key. However, the upper ring-finger key can be used, typically for B2 and B3, in place of the top thumb key on the front of the boot joint. The smallest finger operates three keys. The backmost one, closest to the bassoonist, is held down throughout most of the bass register. The key is not used after F1 is played. F2 is created with this key, as well as G4, B4, B4, and C4. The lowest key for the smallest finger on the right hand is primarily used for A1 (G1) and A2 (G2) but can be used E4, and F4. The frontmost key is used with the bottom thumb key <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> joint to create A1 and A2.|$|E

500|$|Shoe polish {{is applied}} to the shoe using a rag, cloth, or brush. Shoe polish is not a {{cleaning}} product, and therefore the footwear should be both clean and dry before application. A vigorous rubbing action to apply the polish evenly <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot,</b> followed by further buffing with a clean dry cloth or brush, usually provides good results. Another technique, known as spit-polishing or bull polishing, involves gently rubbing polish into the leather with a cloth and a drop of water or spit. This achieves the mirror-like, high-gloss finish sometimes known as a spit shine or bull which is especially valued in military organizations. Despite the term, saliva is less commonly used as the vehicle or diluent with polish than is water. [...] Polishes containing carnauba wax {{can be used as a}} protective coating to extend the life and look of a leather shoe.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{weeks after}} the murder of Witzel, Haarmann killed a 14-year-old named Heinz Martin, who was last seen by his mother on 9 May and who is {{believed}} to have been abducted from Hanover station. All his clothing was later found in Haarmann's apartment. Less than three weeks later, on 26 May, a 17-year-old travelling salesman from the town of Kassel named Fritz Wittig, whom Haarmann would later state he had killed upon the insistence of Grans as he had worn a [...] "good new suit" [...] Grans coveted, was dismembered and discarded in the Leine River. The same day Wittig {{is believed to have}} been killed, Haarmann killed his youngest known victim, 10-year-old Friedrich Abeling, who disappeared while truant from school. His murder would be followed less than two weeks later by that of 16-year-old Friedrich Koch, who was approached by Haarmann on 5 June as he walked to college. Two acquaintances of Koch would later testify at Haarmann's trial that, as they walked with Koch to college, Haarmann had approached Koch and tapped the youth <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>boot</b> with his walking stick and stated: [...] "Well, boy, don't you recognize me?" ...|$|E

And once, in the night, they attacked the stage-coach when a District Judge, of Nevada Territory, was the only passenger, and with their first volley of arrows (and a bullet or two) they riddled the stage curtains, wounded a horse or two and mortally wounded the driver. The latter was full of pluck, and so was his passenger.
