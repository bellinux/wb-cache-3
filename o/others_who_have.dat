5|$|Pierce's {{average of}} 5.62 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched during the 1950s {{was the highest}} by any pitcher with at least 1,000 innings in the decade, with his average of 7.96 hits per nine innings ranking third (behind Ford and Wynn) and his 3.06 ERA also ranking third (behind Ford and Spahn). His final strikeout total ranked 15th among all {{pitchers}} when he retired; of the 24 pitchers who had at least 1,750 strikeouts at that time, Bobo Newsom and Tony Mullane are the only <b>others</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not been elected to the Hall.|$|E
5|$|Sakic {{recorded}} his 1,000th career point on December 27, 1999, against the St. Louis Blues.

60|$|This message {{produced}} the greatest commotion in the city. The {{inhabitants of the}} Alcaiceria, that busy hive of traffic, and all <b>others</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> tasted the sweets of gainful commerce during the late cessation of hostilities, were for securing their golden advantages by timely submission: <b>others,</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> wives and children, looked on them with tenderness and solicitude, and dreaded by resistance to bring upon them the horrors of slavery.|$|R
50|$|Margiotti {{successfully}} defended {{federal judge}} Albert W. Johnson and <b>others</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> {{been accused of}} conspiracy to sell justice.|$|R
5|$|Some of {{the causes}} of {{deliberate}} self-poisoning in Sri Lankan adolescents included bereavement and harsh discipline by parents. The coping mechanisms are being spread in local communities as people are surrounded by <b>others</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> previously deliberately harmed themselves or attempted suicide. One way of reducing self-harm would be to limit access to poisons; however many cases involve pesticides or yellow oleander seeds, and the reduction of access to these agents would be difficult. Great potential for the reduction of self-harm lies in education and prevention, but limited resources in the developing world make these methods challenging.|$|E
5|$|The executioner was masked and disguised, {{and there}} is debate over his identity. The commissioners {{approached}} Richard Brandon, the common hangman of London, but he refused, at least at first, despite being offered £200. It is possible he relented and undertook the commission after being threatened with death, but there are <b>others</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been named as potential candidates, including George Joyce, William Hulet and Hugh Peters. The clean strike, confirmed by {{an examination of the}} king's body at Windsor in 1813, suggests that the execution was carried out by an experienced headsman.|$|E
5|$|Recently, however, {{scholars}} such as David Christian and Constantine Zuckerman {{have suggested}} that the Schechter Letter's account is corroborated by various other Russian chronicles, and suggests a struggle within the early Rus' polity between factions loyal to Oleg and to the Rurikid Igor, a struggle that Oleg ultimately lost. Zuckerman posited that the early chronology of the Rus' had to be re-determined in light of these sources. Among Zuckerman's beliefs and those of <b>others</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> analyzed these sources are that the Khazars did not lose Kiev until the early 10th century (rather than 882, the traditional date), that Igor was not Rurik's son but rather a more distant descendant, and that Oleg did not immediately follow Rurik, but rather that there is a lost generation between the legendary Varangian lord and his documented successors.|$|E
