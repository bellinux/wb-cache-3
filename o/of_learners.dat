25|$|Holt and Willard-Holt (2000) {{emphasize}} {{the concept of}} dynamic assessment, which {{is a way of}} assessing the true potential <b>of</b> <b>learners</b> that differs significantly from conventional tests. Here the essentially interactive nature of learning is extended to the process of assessment. Rather than viewing assessment as a process carried out by one person, such as an instructor, it is seen as a two-way process involving interaction between both instructor and learner. The role of the assessor becomes one of entering into dialogue with the persons being assessed to find out their current level of performance on any task and sharing with them possible ways in which that performance might be improved on a subsequent occasion. Thus, assessment and learning are seen as inextricably linked and not separate processes (Holt and Willard-Holt 2000).|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to explore Chinese learners' conceptions <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> {{autonomy}} from learners' perspective since researchers in language education argue that concepts <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy may bear cultural imprints and recent college English language education reform in China sets learner autonomy {{as a prime}} goal. The study first presents general background and {{an introduction to the}} research context. There follows a comprehensive literature review, tracking origins of the concept <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy in the fields of philosophy, general education, and language education, with distinctive 'Western' and 'Chinese' emphases. This is followed by a review of relevant research on learner autonomy in language education, which consists <b>of</b> research on <b>learner</b> autonomy as a concept, as a means for effective learning, relationships with culture, and methodological issues. To investigate Chinese learners' conceptions <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy, the study adopted a mixed research approach to collect data: with a qualitative method as the main research method to capture in-depth understandings of learners' conceptions, and a quantitative method as a supplementary one to support qualitative data findings {{and at the same time}} reveal further diversity. Moreover, to avoid any imposition <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy theory pre-occupied in the researcher's mind, the study does not ask directly about learner autonomy to learners but instead examines whether concepts <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy are embedded in students' accounts of successful English language learning. The study involved 27 interviews and a questionnaire survey of 450 college English language learners among three different Chinese universities. The main findings of the study are as follows: 1) Both 'Western' and 'Chinese' emphases and core elements <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy are found in Chinese learners' conceptions of successful English language learning; 2) Chinese learners' conceptions <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy are found to exist in two distinctive domains: learner autonomy for academic success (LAAS) and learner autonomy for communicative competence (LACC). 3) Learners' conceptions <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy can be influenced by different sources: political, economical, social, cultural, and individual. 4) Learners' conceptions <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy are dynamic, and subject to various factors such as progress of level of education and individual language learning experiences. Based on the data findings, a reconsideration <b>of</b> concepts <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy drawn out from students' conceptions of successful English language learning is discussed, which combines 'Western', 'Chinese' emphases and core elements <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy, associated behaviours, and sources of influences on them. This reconstruction of the concept <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy in the Chinese context contributes to a better understanding <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy theory. The research has important implications for policy makers, teachers, parents, and students in understanding learner autonomy from learners' perspectives and for research into concepts <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy in different contexts...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{field of}} {{language}} education {{has for the}} last three decades been witnessing the debate over the issue <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy. The present study is a literature review <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy focusing on highlighting the main themes <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy since it first entered the arena of language teaching. These themes are based on the concepts <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> responsibility and independence, the importance of the classroom context in both the Western and Eastern style {{and the role of the}} language classroom teacher. The present study also shows that although learner autonomy means a reshaping of the view that the learner is responsible for learning, teachers do not abdicate their responsibilities of teaching in the language learning process and on the contrary teachers become the primary agents on fostering the development <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> autonomy within the classroom context...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> {{support has}} been emphasized {{over and over in}} the distance education literature but {{there is a lack of}} comprehensive analysis of this issue. Besides that, most of existing studies on learner support are based on large-scale correspondence program and few of them provide guidelines for planning and implementing support services in Web-based environments for dual-mode institutions, which is the majority of distance education program providers in nowadays. In this paper, a body <b>of</b> literature on <b>learner</b> support, including various journal articles and technical reports, was examined, and three issues emerged from the review: (1) the lack of research on cost-effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> support; (2) the lack of empirical research; and (3) the need for learner-centered approach in designing and implementing learner support. These issues are discussed in detail to enhance understanding <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> support in post-secondary level distance education program, and it is further argued that future research should focus more on developing and refining methods for cost-benefit analysis <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> support, developing a general framework <b>of</b> <b>learner</b> support model in dual-mode institutions, and developing systematic methods to identify, analyze, synthesize, and assess the needs <b>of</b> distance <b>learners.</b> (Contains 63 references.)

In addition, [...] "second language learners are also able to produce and process simple sentences before complex sentences" [...] (Pienemann et al.2005), just like first language learners. For example, the theory of serial search models and parallel access models. Serial Search Models propose that when monolinguals encounter a word, they will look through all the lexical entries to distinguish whether the input item is a word not, and then they will only retrieve the necessary information about that word (i.e., its semantics or orthography). They also propose that the lexical access would process sequentially by activating only one lexical entry at a time. In contrast, the Parallel Access Models believe that multiple entries can be activated at once, which means that the perceptual input from a word would activate all lexical items directly, even though some of them might not be necessary. In this way, numbers of potential candidates would be activated simultaneously and then the lexical candidates which are most consistent with the input stimulus would be chosen. [...] Later, the researchers addressed that both the serial and parallel process are accounted for the lexical organization and lexical access.|$|E

Is the Professorial system--the system, I mean, of teaching in the lecture-room alone, and leaving the student to find his own way when he is outside the lecture-room--adequate to the wants <b>of</b> <b>learners?</b> In answering this question, I confine myself to my own province, and I venture to reply for Physical Science, assuredly and undoubtedly, No. As I have already intimated, practical work in the Laboratory is absolutely indispensable, and that practical work must be guided and superintended by a sufficient staff of Demonstrators, who are for Science what Tutors are for other branches of study. And {{there must be a}} good supply of such Demonstrators. I doubt if the practical work of more than twenty students can be properly superintended by one Demonstrator. If we take the working day at six hours, that is less than twenty minutes apiece--not a very large allowance of time for helping a dull man, for correcting an inaccurate one, or even for making an intelligent student clearly apprehend what he is about. And, no doubt, the supplying of a proper amount of this tutorial, practical teaching, is a difficulty in the way of giving proper instruction in Physical Science in such Universities as that of Aberdeen, which are devoid of endowments; and, unlike the English Universities, have no moral claim on the funds of richly endowed bodies to supply their wants.|$|E
