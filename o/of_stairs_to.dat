5|$|Since 2001, {{the tower}} has {{played host to}} an annual stair climb race up 53 flights <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the roof.|$|E
5|$|From the Lexington Avenue entrance, {{there are}} two short {{escalators}} and a stair from the northwest corner, a staircase from the southwest corner, and a short elevator hidden {{around the corner from}} the escalators. From the fare control, {{there are two}} long escalators and a stair to an intermediate level, and then two shorter escalators and a pair <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> a lower mezzanine. Here, the bank splits and there are two separate tubes of two escalators and a stair each to each platform. The platform elevator has its own two turnstiles, and makes three stops (mezzanine, upper platform, lower platform).|$|E
5|$|The Dalek {{ability to}} fly or hover {{dates back to}} The Chase, where a Dalek was implied to have taken flight, while in Revelation of the Daleks, a Dalek hovered to exterminate two victims. The {{first part of the}} 1988 serial Remembrance of the Daleks shows a Dalek who was clearly seen to hover up a flight <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the Doctor's horror. Rose and Adam allude to a long-held fan joke about the Daleks' {{inability}} to climb stairs, and are horrified when it does so.|$|E

5|$|The video premiered on October 4, 1994, on MTV. It {{begins with}} showing the {{neighborhood}} of Harlem, with Madonna as a singer in a small jazz club. She simply sits in the club with her band and sings for her small, mostly black and Latino audience. Interspersed throughout the video are scenes {{of people living in}} Harlem, doing their daily chores, including a supporting cast of transvestite prostitutes, a pimp, and a black gang member who shows off the scars on his body. During the intermediate verses, Madonna is shown writhing in the lap of an older, maternal woman, who symbolically baptizes her by splashing water on her forehead. Near the video's end, Madonna walks through the neighborhood and climbs a set <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> have a reunion with her family, a young Latin man and their supposed son. The video ends with Madonna smiling towards the camera while sitting at the nightclub.|$|E

25|$|Sir Walter Scott's story My Aunt Margaret's Mirror is {{believed}} to have been based on efforts made by the Earl <b>of</b> <b>Stair</b> <b>to</b> get Lady Eleanor Primrose Campbell <b>to</b> marry him. <b>Stair</b> wanted his earldom to pass to his nephew John Dalrymple; but on 4 May 1748 the House of Lords ruled that the right to nominate an heir had lapsed, and the earldom passed to the legal heir James Dalrymple, 3rd Earl <b>of</b> <b>Stair.</b>|$|R
50|$|Buses {{from the}} center of the city arrive at a stop {{alongside}} the road. A long set <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> leads down <b>to</b> the river, and a short bridge leads across it. A similar set <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> leads up <b>to</b> the gate of the temple.|$|R
25|$|Despite {{the initial}} scenes of despair and panic that had issued from that quadrant, patrons {{in the lower}} parquet and parquet circle were able to escape in under three minutes, having access to Flood's Alley and Washington Street exits and having no flights <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> negotiate. The least crowded section of the theatre had the best {{evacuation}} routes.|$|E
25|$|Away {{fans for}} league matches were {{originally}} accommodated {{in the upper}} level, in the north west corner, which can hold a maximum of 3,000 fans. However, plans were made {{at the end of}} the 2007–2008 season to relocate the away supporters to the far end of the upper level of the Leazes End. This location has attracted criticism due to the poor view offered by being so far from the pitch due the height of the stand, and the 14 flights <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> reach the upper level. For FA Cup matches the lower section of the corner is also used.|$|E
25|$|Furthest {{from the}} stage and up against the theatre ceiling, the family circle offered the {{cheapest}} accommodations and had the most roundabout access to the street. The passageway started from the gallery, passed through a curtain partition, then descended southward down a short flight <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> a platform set against the south wall. It turned right (west) and descended another flight of stairs anchored to the south wall, ending at a second floor corridor. Patrons would turn right into this corridor and follow the passageway northward along the west wall to the family circle box office. The passage then turned left, westward again, descended a third flight of stairs down to a short, street-level hallway that led onto Washington Street (See Floor Plan 2).|$|E

25|$|Coming {{from a poor}} family, {{at the age of}} nine, Siti had to wake up at 4:00am to {{help her}} mother making and selling various {{homemade}} kuih in her neighbourhood, where sometimes, she also had to carry a makeshift table down three flights <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the main road to set up a small stall. She commented that all the hardships have not only helped her to be more frugal when spending, but also to be more confident when communicating with the public. She also jokingly said that the whole experience has helped to improve her vocal skills as she has to shout to call for customers. Apart from participating in singing competitions, she also used to follow her uncle, Abdul Rahim Bachik to invitational shows like wedding ceremonies and dinner parties which have helped to expose her to performing live.|$|E
25|$|St Stephen's Entrance, roughly in {{the middle}} of the building's western front, is the {{entrance}} for members of the public. From there, visitors walk through a flight <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> St Stephen's Hall, location of a collection of marbles, which includes Somers Mansfield, Hampden, Walpole, Pitt and Fox. Traversal of this hallway brings them to the octagonal Central Lobby, the hub of the Palace. This hall is flanked by symmetrical corridors decorated with fresco paintings, which lead to the ante-rooms and debating chambers of the two Houses: the Members' Lobby and Commons Chamber to the north, and the Peers' Lobby and Lords Chamber to the south. Another mural-lined corridor leads east to the Lower Waiting Hall and the staircase to the first floor, where the river front is occupied by a row of 16 committee rooms. Directly below them, the libraries of the two Houses overlook the Thames from the principal floor.|$|E
25|$|Palestinians are {{barred from}} using Al-Shuhada Street, a {{principal}} commercial thoroughfare.″Those who still live on Shuhada Street can’t enter {{their own homes}} from the street. Some use the rooftops {{to go in and}} out, climbing from one roof to another before issuing into adjacent homes or alleys. Some have cut gaping holes in the walls connecting their homes to other (often deserted) houses and thus pass through these buildings until they can exit into a lane outside or up a flight <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> a passageway on top of the old casba market. According to a survey conducted by the human-rights organization B’Tselem in 2007, 42 per cent of the Palestinian population in the city center of Hebron (area H2)—some 1,014 families—have abandoned their homes and moved out, most of them to area H1, now under Palestinian control.″ As a result, about half the Arab shops in H2 have gone out of business since 1994.|$|E

500|$|Ketevan Melua, {{known as}} Ketino to her family, {{was born to}} Amiran and Tamara Melua in Kutaisi, Georgia, which was then part of the Soviet Union. She spent her first years with her {{grandparents}} in Tbilisi before moving {{with her parents and}} brother to the town of Batumi, Ajaria, where her father worked as a heart specialist. During this time, Melua sometimes had to carry buckets of water up five flights <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> her family's flat and according to her, [...] "Now, when I'm staying in luxurious hotels, I think back to those days".|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the human}} {{characters}}, the animal characters were animated without live-action reference. During production, none of Kimball's designs for Lucifer had pleased Disney. After visiting Kimball's steam train at his home, Walt saw his calico cat and remarked, [...] "Hey—there's your model for Lucifer". Reitherman animated the sequence in which Jaq and Gus laboriously drag the key up the flight <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> Cinderella.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, a new {{inclined}} elevator was installed. It travels on a 10° angle for {{the first}} , shifting its position horizontally , and straight up for the [...] remainder of the climb. The elevator car stays level at all times during its movement {{because it has a}} gimbal-mounted double frame. Before the installation of the new elevator, the observatory had been reached by taking first one elevator, then climbing a flight <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> a second elevator.|$|E

2500|$|Access to {{the dress}} circle was more straightforward. Patrons entered {{and left the}} dress circle via a flight of [...] stairs that descended south to a landing, then turned right onto a second flight that opened into the lobby. Patrons in the dress circle also had a second {{emergency}} exit along the alley side of the building, going down a flight <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> the middle exit onto Flood's Alley. The exit was generally locked against gate crashers so the stairs were little used and not well known.|$|E
2500|$|When it was opened, it was {{condemned}} by some for being [...] "shabby, dark, difficult to navigate" [...] with telecommunications and lifts being plagued by technical difficulties; Parliament President Nicole Fontaine climbed nine flights <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> her office {{rather than risk}} being trapped in the notorious lifts. In 2002, the building's water supply was hit by an outbreak of Legionnaires disease, {{due to the lack}} of use for much of the year (see [...] "Secondary buildings" [...] below) and in 2008 the ceiling of the plenary chamber collapsed (see [...] "Hemicycle" [...] above).|$|E
2500|$|The Embassy Dance Hall, {{and then}} the Ambassador Theatre, {{occupied}} the same building at different periods.

[...] It was an all timber structure of 33.5m x 17m with a [...] 6.5m ceiling height. [...] Entry was from the Enoggera Creek end via a twin flight <b>of</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>to</b> a wide verandah. [...] The Hall had side alcoves, a raised stage, two change rooms, a small apartment and a side refreshment counter. [...] Male and female toilets were under the building at the creek end.|$|E
