25|$|Using Figure 3 and {{knowledge}} of the upstream and downstream conditions and the depth values {{on either side of the}} gate, a general estimate of the profiles upstream and downstream of the gate can be generated. Upstream, the water surface must rise from a normal depth of 0.97 m to 9.21 m at the gate. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this on a mild reach is to follow an M1 profile. The same logic applies downstream to determine that the water surface follows an M3 profile from the gate until the depth reaches the conjugate depth of the normal depth at which point a hydraulic jump forms to raise the water surface to the normal depth.|$|E

25|$|In ancient China, {{women were}} under-appreciated. This opinion was {{deeply rooted in}} the mind of Lanyingâ€™s family. Compared with her little sisters, she was quite lucky because she was the first baby. All of her sisters were sent to be child brides or killed. She was often mistreated and was not allowed to get an education. Before she was 6 years old, Lanying was {{required}} to wash all the clothes and cook for whole family. At age of six, she wanted to go to school because she wanted to escape the traditional pattern for women at her time, which was doing housework and chatting with other women all day. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> was to get an education. However, her mother, who was deeply influenced by gender schema from society and controlled her life, did not allow that. So Lanying locked herself in her room and swore that she would not eat if she was not allowed to go to school. Her mother was moved by her insistence, so she finally got the chance to get an education.|$|E
25|$|After the {{breakout}} {{from the}} Pusan Perimeter in November 1950, the 8th flew daily strike missions out of Iwakuni {{and at times}} recovering at Taegu AB (K-2), which forced the crews to fly long, arduous missions that sometimes lasted more than six hours. When the Chinese Communists attacked in the Spring of 1951, FEAF requested that the light bomber wings increase their nightly sortie rate. The <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this was to double {{up some of the}} missions. For several months, the crews flew from Iwakuni to their patrol sectors in North Korea, completed their mission, and then flew to the K-2 Airfield. Landing a B-26 at night at Taegu was no easy feat because the Pierced Steel Planking on the runway had begun to deteriorate. The B-26s landing there tore up dozens of tires, {{and more than a few}} accidents resulted. Also, the tires were in short supply, so each one lost at K-2 was hard to replace. If the B-26 crews got down at Taegu without incident, they could find a place to grab a quick catnap as their planes were readied for the next mission. About an hour later, they were airborne and heading north to their next target area. Four hours later, utterly exhausted, they were back in Japan, after up to ten hours of flight and combat.|$|E

500|$|Originally titled N.3.R.D, {{the title}} was changed to Seeing Sounds. Williams {{explained}} that {{the title was}} based on synesthesia, a neurological phenomenon the band learned of while watching the Discovery Channel. They were inspired to create music that could be conceived as a live show. He {{was surprised to learn}} not everyone experienced while listening to music. He described synesthesia as the outcome when [...] "one sense gets more information than what's intended", stimulated by sensory deprivation. Haley further elaborated, saying that it is a mixture of senses that causes a person to experience colorful hearing and auditory smell. When the band created the album, it was the music they envisioned and decided the appropriate title for the album, Seeing Sounds. Williams pointed out that the lyrics were also inspired by synesthesia. He said that his fans want to [...] "rock out" [...] and be taken on an [...] "emotional roller coaster", and the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that is to give the fans some records they could blast out on their speakers. The European-influenced music is layered and textured with many music modalities, differing from their past club-oriented albums. Hugo called the album a [...] "big album of LSD, sonic drug".

500|$|Despite the New York City setting, {{additional}} skyscrapers in Chicago, Illinois provided {{inspiration for}} the opening sequence of the skyline, such as the Merchandise Mart and Aon Center. Skyscrapers from New York City included the Chanin Building, the Fred F. French Building and One Wall Street, Manhattan. [...] "We took all our favorite buildings in New York from where they actually stood and sort of put them into one neighborhood," [...] Gassner continued, [...] "a fantasy vision which adds to the atmosphere and flavor." [...] First of all, a model had to be created based on the fantasy 1950's New York for the opening shot. So a miniature city was created, as McAlister mentioned that the Coens did not want a realistic reproduction of [...] 1950's New York skyline, instead they wanted a more stylized version of it. [...] So Gassner used the book New York in The Forties as a reference to create the look for the cityscape. It took three months and 27 crew member to create the miniature city at the scale of 24:1. As for the Hudsucker building, they made it at the scale of 6:1 for closer shots including the long-zoom in of Norville at the beginning. For that scene to be created, it started off with a wide angle shot, moving closer towards Tim Robbins, who was standing in a full sized set, which they inserted inside the shot of the model clock. â€˜Marrying a live-action image with a painted or miniature element was, of course, nothing new, however, {{in the case of}} the zoom-in on Robbins from such a distance, keeping the full-size set locked in with the model building, â€˜that was state-of-the-art and the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it was with computers.â€™ says McAlister. Most of the buildings were created with two sides only, as they will only be seen from the front and the side, and some only needed one side as they were only going to be seen from the front, while the Hudsucker building was made completely three-dimensional. The work of The Computer Film Company (supervised by Janek Sirrs) included manipulations of the zoom-in shot of Norville at the beginning, as well as CGI snow and composites of the falling sequences.|$|E
500|$|Three months later, the EPB {{issued a}} joint press release with the PRT and the PRTP announcing {{the death of}} one of its members, William Pintado Burgos. After {{emphasizing}} that he had joined the armed resistance from a young age as a believer in independence and socialism, the organizations proceeded to posthumously grant him the title of Commander of the Puerto Rican Revolution, which is only granted to those that are deemed to have [...] "stood firm and battled the motherland's enemy". Months later, on the birthday of RamÃ³n Emeterio Betances, the EBP joined Jornada Betances in a homage to the Puerto Rican students involved in the protests against the FortuÃ±o administration. Remembering that September 23, 1868, is now celebrated as [...] "the birth of the Puerto Rican nation", having been the date of the Cry of Lares when Betances and several other revolted against Spain and proclaimed the first Republic of Puerto Rico under Francisco RamÃ­rez Medina, the group insisted {{that it was time to}} do the same as that day. Citing Pedro Albizu Campos's phrase [...] "it's difficult to give a speech while the mother is lying on bed and there is a killer prowling", the Macheteros anthropomorphized the influence of the United States as that murderer and labeled the Via Verde project and cases of government corruption as examples of actions being taken against the motherland, urging the public to mimic the actions of Lares. Blaming FortuÃ±o, Figueroa Sancha and Fraticelli for a violent response to the UPR strike, the EPB congratulated the students for precipitating a negotiation procedure. Despite this, the organization urged the public to continue its resistance against the measures adopted by the FortuÃ±o administration. The Macheteros also informed that they were [...] "gathering strength, preparing the stage and studying" [...] its opponents, quoting Betances' strategy of patiently and convertly planning every revolutionary action before executing them. The group stated that public education would be defended by [...] "an army of students and communities". The EBP concluded its statement by warning that [...] "the enemy was to be confronted with proper planning and intelligence [...] knowing when to strike". In lobbying for an unified national front, the Macheteros insisted that to accomplish independence the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it was by following the armed resistance promoted by Betances, Albizu, Corretjer and Ojeda RÃ­os.|$|E
