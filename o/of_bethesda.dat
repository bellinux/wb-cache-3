He {{spent the last two}} years of his life in and out <b>of</b> <b>Bethesda</b> Naval Hospital. Though he experienced increasing periods of confusion, he continued to give orders to his staff by telephone; Roosevelt had instructed them to treat Howe's calls with courtesy, but to double-check his instructions with himself and other staff. Howe died on April 18, 1936. Roosevelt gave him a state funeral three days later in the White House East Room.|$|E
5|$|During Oblivions development, Bethesda {{concentrated}} on creating {{a system with}} a more realistic storyline, believable characters, and meaningful quests than had {{been done in the}} past. In comparison with previous titles in the series, the game features improved artificial intelligence thanks to the use <b>of</b> <b>Bethesda</b> proprietary Radiant A.I. software, and enhanced physics facilitated by the Havok physics engine. The graphics take advantage of advanced lighting and shader routines such as high dynamic range rendering (HDR) and specular mapping. Bethesda developed and implemented procedural content creation tools in the building of Oblivions terrain, leading to the expedited creation of landscapes that are more complex and realistic than in past titles.|$|E
5|$|During this campaign, the 21st {{suffered}} heavy casualties {{during the}} Battle of Spotsylvania and the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Bethesda</b> Church.

Grant's Overland Campaign concluded with several assaults on Petersburg, Virginia, on June 15–18, 1864. The 21st again took considerable casualties during these attacks, particularly during the assault on June 17. Maj. Henry Richardson, commanding the 21st, {{was wounded in the}} thigh during the engagement and was shortly thereafter sent home. Now numbering less than 100 men, the regiment had been reduced to a tenth of its original size. Company A, by this time, had only three men on its active roster.|$|E

5000|$|The area {{commonly}} known as [...] "Downtown Bethesda" [...] is centered {{at the intersection of}} Wisconsin Avenue, Old Georgetown Road and East-West Highway.

25|$|Hampton's {{claim of}} victory was also credible. He had {{prevented}} Sheridan from learning {{the disposition of}} Lee's army while delaying the Union advance for seven hours. And General Lee received the valuable intelligence he had sought. He now knew that Grant had crossed the Pamunkey in force, although he was still unclear on the next steps that Grant might take and therefore waited for further developments. The two armies would fight in this general vicinity on May 30 in the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Bethesda</b> Church.|$|E
25|$|MD 396 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with MD 614 (Goldsboro Road) {{on the edge}} <b>of</b> <b>Bethesda</b> near Glen Echo.

Just east of its underpass of the Capital Crescent Trail, MD 396 meets {{the southern end of}} Little Falls Parkway and crosses Little Falls Branch. The highway reaches its eastern terminus at its entrance to Westmoreland Circle, which straddles the District of Columbia boundary and whose Maryland half is unsigned MD 396A.

25|$|After Grant's {{infantry}} {{had crossed}} to the south bank of the Pamunkey, Lee saw an opportunity on May 30 to attack Warren's advancing V Corps with his Second Corps, now commanded by Lt. Gen. Jubal Early. Early's divisions under Maj. Gens. Robert E. Rodes and Stephen Dodson Ramseur drove the Union troops back in the Battle <b>of</b> <b>Bethesda</b> Church, but Ramseur's advance was stopped by a fierce stand of infantry and artillery fire. On that same day, a small cavalry engagement at Matadequin Creek (the Battle of Old Church) drove an outnumbered Confederate cavalry brigade to the crossroads of Old Cold Harbor, verifying to Lee that Grant intended to move toward that vital intersection beyond Lee's right flank, attempting to avoid another stalemate on the Totopotomoy Creek line.|$|E

Bradley Boulevard continues west as a county highway along the edge of Congressional Country Club to its end at Persimmon Tree Road, which connects Potomac with Cabin John. The named road's terminus is near another well known golf course, the TPC Potomac at Avenel Farm. MD 191 heads northeast along the edge of another part of Congressional Country Club and crosses Cabin John Creek before the route intersects Seven Locks Road. The highway continues east past Bethesda Country Club and temporarily expands to a wide two-lane divided highway around its overpass of I-495 (Capital Beltway). MD 191 passes to the north of Burning Tree Club, then curves southeast through the western parts <b>of</b> <b>Bethesda.</b> At Huntington Parkway, which leads east to MD 187 (Old Georgetown Road), the state highway veers south and intersects MD 188 (Wilson Lane).|$|E
25|$|MD 190 crosses Cabin John Creek and expands to a four-lane {{divided highway}} {{just west of}} Seven Locks Road. The state highway has a partial {{cloverleaf}} interchange with I-495 (Capital Beltway) that includes access to Cabin John Parkway. East of the Capital Beltway, the route becomes a partially controlled access highway, with adjacent properties accessed by service roads or intersecting streets. MD 190 passes {{to the south of}} the Burning Tree Club and the Holton-Arms School before crossing Booze Creek. The highway continues through the southern part <b>of</b> <b>Bethesda,</b> where the road intersects MD 188 (Wilson Lane) and MD 614 (Goldsboro Road); between the two highways, the highway passes Walt Whitman High School. MD 190 loses access of control and becomes an undivided road with center turn lane west of its underpass of the Capital Crescent Trail. The highway becomes an undivided four-lane road between its intersection with Little Falls Parkway and its crossing of Little Falls Branch. MD 190 reaches its eastern terminus at Western Avenue at the District of Columbia boundary. River Road continues into Washington as a two-lane unnumbered street that ends at Wisconsin Avenue in Tenleytown.|$|E

500|$|According to Kopp, the Pool <b>of</b> <b>Bethesda</b> became {{associated}} with a Byzantine church by 450CE; then a 6th-century church, which {{by the arrival of}} the Crusaders, in 1099, was known as the [...] "Church of St. Anne". A new Church of St. Anne was built in the 12th century CE; the church and the pool fell into disuse {{after the fall of the}} Kingdom of Jerusalem. The church was converted into madrasah and Christian pilgrims were redirected to nearby Birket Israel on the other side of what is now called the [...] "Via Dolorosa". Ownership of the whole site of the Church of St. Anne passed to France after the Crimean War, in 1856; and discoveries made in around 1870 led to the belief that the real Pool <b>of</b> <b>Bethesda</b> was actually located in the grounds of the Church of St. Anne.|$|E
500|$|The name Bethesda {{comes from}} the Aramaic בית חסד/חסדא (beth ḥesda; [...] "House of Mercy"). It {{originally}} referred to the Pool <b>of</b> <b>Bethesda,</b> {{a pool of water}} in Jerusalem reputed to have healing powers. Bethesda was a popular name for chapels and meeting houses among Nonconformists; Bethesda Chapels were built, for example, in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, Stroud, Gloucestershire, and Rillington, Yorkshire.|$|E
500|$|The Birket Israel cistern was {{frequented by}} Christian pilgrims during the 19th century, it being {{previously}} {{identified as the}} [...] "Sheep Pool" [...] or Pool <b>of</b> <b>Bethesda</b> of a double-pool with five porches, where the sick came to be cured. [...] This link {{was based on the}} premise that the nearby St. Stephen's Gate occupied the site of the Sheep Gate mentioned in the New Testament. It was reinforced by the co-location of the names 'Birket Israel' and the 'Pool of Bethesda' on maps and plans of Jerusalem; and in drawings and paintings, such as those made by David Roberts in 1893.|$|E
