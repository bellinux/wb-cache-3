5|$|Representative {{of the new}} {{historical}} perspective is the 2003 biography by Pauline Croft. Reviewer John Cramsie summarises her findings:Croft's <b>overall</b> <b>assessment</b> of James is appropriately mixed. She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to different points of view, and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms' financial means. His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate {{lack of attention to}} the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice and opened the door for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk. Many of these criticisms are framed within a longer view of James' reigns, including the legacy – now understood to be more troubled – which he left Charles I.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} {{insights}} into the deeper challenges of making and communicating <b>overall</b> <b>assessments</b> of organic food systems. Methods to do <b>overall</b> sustainability <b>assessment</b> are very different, they produce different assessments, {{and none of them}} can claim to have the ‘right’ answer. This paper aims to show some of the deeper challenges of making and communicating <b>overall</b> <b>assessments</b> of organic food systems, by investigating the role of scientific and stakeholder perspectives. Some results are that (1) sustainability is a paradoxical perspective, which relies on a multitude of specialised scientific perspectives; (2) assessments are based on built-in, but mostly hidden and sometimes incompatible values; and (3) the key to successful <b>overall</b> <b>assessments</b> is to make perspectives and values explicit in order to enable assessment of assessments in a participatory process. We conclude {{that there is a need}} to develop new participatory methods to handle perspectives and values in the preparation and communication of assessments of organic food systems...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} develop better and more {{sustainable}} food systems, we need to make, and use, <b>overall</b> <b>assessments</b> of their effects, based on multiple criteria. This is a complex and very difficult task. Two of the main challenges are 1) how to balance very different types of assessments and avoid bias in favour of accurate knowledge and that which is easy to measure, and 2) how to communicate complex <b>overall</b> <b>assessments</b> {{in such a way}} they can be used in practice by different actors and stakeholders with different perspectives and values. Description: Alternative, more sustainable food systems are developed in relation to a plurality of societal objectives and ethical guidelines, such as the organic principles. The success of these alternatives depends on whether they can continue to improve in relation to their goals, and thereby maintain credibility and trust; and to do this, {{there is a need for}} <b>overall</b> <b>assessments</b> of their effects on society, environment and nature. Developing and using such <b>overall,</b> multicriteria <b>assessments</b> poses significant cross- and transdisciplinary challenges. In this workshop we focus on two main challenges: balancing and communicating. Some of the effects of food systems can be measured in quantitative terms. For others, qualitative assessments are more suitable. Some are well known, others little known. Some are easy to measure, others difficult and costly to assess. The first challenge in making <b>overall</b> <b>assessments</b> based on multiple criteria is therefore how to establish a balance between the different types of assessments and knowledges. This concerns both foundational, theoretical issues and more practical, methodological issues. Attempting to evaluate all aspects of organic farming in monetary terms, for instance, would be both empirically demanding and theoretically problematic. Furthermore, such <b>overall</b> <b>assessments</b> will be of little use if they cannot be understood and accepted by the many different actors and stakeholders in food systems. The second challenge is thus how to communicate <b>overall</b> <b>assessments</b> so that they can be used in the development of alternative food systems – something which requires a mutual learning process between researchers and stakeholders. An important question here is how normative criteria are built into a multicriteria assessment framework, e. g. in the selections and condensations made and in the ‘orientors’ connected to the chosen indicators; and how these built-in values relate to the ethical principles, the societal objectives, and the values and interests of different stakeholders. There is a need for normative transparency. A second important question is how to communicate very complex assessments in an effective and participatory way. The ability to handle complex information differs, there are multiple expert and stakeholder perspectives involved, and the media play an important role when credibility and trust are constructed and negotiated. Reduction of complexity is necessary, but where and how is decisive. Workshop method and organisation: Oral presentation. Participants are expected to have read the papers before the workshop. At the workshop, there will be three minute presentations of the main theses in the paper, followed by round-table discussions, one group for each paper. Summary from each group at the end, beginning with ‘lessons learned’ from the presenter and supplemented by others. What can the participant expect? In depth discussions of the papers presented.

However, the Hope Simpson Enquiry did note that there was significant illegal immigration from the surrounding Arab territories, while the Peel Commission and Survey of Palestine claimed that immigration played only a minor role in the growth of the Arab population. The 1931 census of Palestine considered the question of illegal immigration since the previous census in 1922. It estimated that unrecorded immigration during that period may have amounted to 9,000 Jews and 4,000 Arabs. It also gave the proportion of persons living in Palestine in 1931 who were born outside Palestine: Muslims, 2%; Christians, 20%; Jews, 58%.|$|E

In contrast to the more elaborate bebop piano, he stressed straightforward melodies rather than complex harmonies, and included short riffs and motifs that came and went {{over the course of a}} solo. While his right hand provided cleanly played lines, his left added bouncy, darker notes and chords in a near-perpetual rumble. Silver [...] "always played percussively, rarely suggesting excessive force on the keys but mustering a crisp [...] sound."

500|$|Susan Beegel {{has written}} that some more recent critics—writing {{through the lens of}} a more modern social and {{cultural}} context several decades after Hemingway's death, and {{more than half a century}} after his novels were first published—have characterized the social era portrayed in his fiction as misogynistic and homophobic. In her 1996 essay, [...] "Critical Reception", Beegel analyzed four decades of Hemingway criticism and found that [...] "critics interested in multiculturalism", particularly in the 1980s, simply ignored Hemingway, although some [...] "apologetics" [...] have been written. Typical, according to Beegel, is an analysis of Hemingway's 1926 novel, The Sun Also Rises, in which a critic contended: [...] "Hemingway never lets the reader forget that Cohn is a Jew, not an unattractive character who happens to be a Jew but a character who is unattractive because he is a Jew." [...] Also during the 1980s, according to Beegel, criticism was published that focused on investigating the [...] "horror of homosexuality" [...] and the [...] "racism" [...] typical of the social era portrayed in Hemingway's fiction.

500|$|Carme Juncadella {{produced}} a systematic review of research as of 2013 {{related to the}} impact of NVC on the development of empathy. She found 13 studies which met her inclusion criteria (three were published in peer reviewed journals; ten were unpublished theses or researcher reports). Eleven of these suggested an increase in empathy subsequent to the application of NVC (five of these with evidence of statistical significance) and two did not. Juncadella notes several shortcomings of her review. None of the studies she included were randomized and only three used validated instruments. As a result she used a narrative synthesis review format, which, [...] "lacks precision," [...] but allows the summarization of studies of different types, sizes, outcome measures and aims. She suggests the primary limitation of her review is that a number of relevant studies exist that could not be included due to lack of availability. She suggests these might have significantly altered her results. Finally, she includes the following caveat: [...] "I must mention the inevitable subjectivity bias present throughout the whole review. In spite of the efforts made towards 'disciplined subjectivity'... my decisions show a degree of uncertainty and inaccuracy born via the tension between the weak evidence of the studies and my own convictions about the NVC model." [...] Her <b>overall</b> <b>assessment</b> of the current research on NVC's efficacy in promoting the development of empathy is that the results are promising, but [...] "would need to be confirmed with further studies bearing stronger designs and more appropriate measures." [...] She notes that a major shortcoming of the existing research is the [...] "mismatch between the constructs of the model and the validated empathy measures" [...] and suggests that improved instruments need to be developed to adequately test NVC.|$|E

40|$|Imagine {{there is}} a {{platform}} {{that makes it possible}} to discuss organics between all parties in the organic food chain based on their individual criteria. The MultiTrust project has endeavoured to find a tool to solve this challenge: How to make <b>overall</b> <b>assessments</b> of the effects of organic production {{in such a way that}} they actually can make a difference in practice. Organic products have to compete against conventional products, and often the organic have difficulties comparing when measured on single criteria. The hall mark of organics is the holistic approach, considering many issues at the same time, and therefore {{there is a}} need for <b>overall</b> <b>assessments.</b> <b>Overall</b> <b>assessments</b> can be very complex and therefore difficult to communicate. And it can be difficult to determine how they can be made simpler, because simplification implies a range of chices on what is important and how to weigh the different criteria. Hence, if the <b>overall</b> <b>assessments</b> are simple, they typically are so by way of hiding information (perspectives, choices and values) in form of indexes or the like. Organic products are not only prducts that have been produces in accordance with the organic rules. Many producers want to make an extra effort above the standard secured by the organic label. The organic products harbour qualities that have been determined through a range of choices and actions made in the organic production and in the following processing, transport and trade. Emphasis can be put on the type of organic manure, the design of the orchard to promote natural enimies, how to ensure high animal welfare and well-being, how to save energy in the production, what kind of packaging to use for retailing the products, etc. When the consumer stands at the refrigerated counter in the shop, and when the farmer spreads straw in the calf box, they know very little about each other and how the other actors in the food chain act, and they have limited options for making contact. But if the initiatives that are made to improve organics are to succeed, then the other actors in the chain have to be able to honour the extra effort. There is a need to commun icate and coordinate across the organic value chain. The MultiTrust project has illuminated these challenges through a range of analyses, workshops and hearings with representatives of the organic actors and stakeholders. This work has led to the development of a prototype tool that is able to establish contacts across the chain and give the consumers an overview of what has been done in the organic value chain to give the products their particular qualities. The tool is an interactive, internet-based platform where farmers, companies, retailers and consumers can work together to improve organics based on multiple criteria. The MultiTrust project has produced an animated video to illustrate the problematic and show how the tool can be built and how different actors can be involved.

Aim: To evaluate {{the impact of a}} multifaceted intervention on pain management. Design: Prospective interventional study. Methods: Three cross-sectional surveys were conducted: before, 4 months after and 14 months after a multifaceted intervention at the medical walk-in clinic of a university hospital. The intervention included both educational activities and structural changes. Use of recommended pain management procedures, pain relief and <b>overall</b> <b>assessments</b> of pain treatment and health professionals' attitudes were assessed using patient questionnaires, collected by mail. History of pain, records of pain intensity and use of pain medication were extracted from medical files. Results: We analysed 1409 medical files and 695 questionnaires of patients presenting with pain. Documentation of pain intensity and administration of pain medication at the walk-in clinic improved significantly 14 months after the intervention (7 % vs. 53 % and 17 % vs. 27 %, respectively, p < 0. 001) and pain medication was more often administered by the oral route (14 % vs. 23 %, p < 0. 001).
