5|$|A few modern {{historians have}} {{considered}} murder as an option. Alison Weir has tentatively suggested William Cecil as organizer of Amy Dudley's {{death on the}} grounds that, if Amy was mortally ill, he had the strongest murder motive {{and that he was}} the main beneficiary of the ensuing scandal. Against this idea {{it has been argued that}} he would have risked damaging neither Elizabeth's reputation nor his own position. The notion of Sir Richard Verney killing Amy Robsart after long and fruitless efforts to poison her (with and without his master's knowledge) has been revived by George Bernard and by Chris Skidmore on the basis that Verney appears in both the c.1563 chronicle by John Hales (also called Journal <b>of</b> <b>Matters</b> of State) and the 1584 libel Leicester's Commonwealth. This coincidence has as often been evaluated as no more than a tradition of gossip, poison being a stock-in-trade accusation in the 16th century.|$|E

5|$|Following Charan Singh's resignation, Reddy summoned Chandrashekhar and Jagjivan Ram to Rashtrapati Bhavan to {{look into}} the {{possibility}} of forming an alternate government. Reddy, convinced {{that they would not be}} able to form one, accepted Singh's advice and dissolved Lok Sabha, calling for a mid term election. Singh was asked to continue as the caretaker prime minister till a new government was sworn in after the election. Reddy's decision was met with angry denunciations and protests by members of the Janata Party who even threatened to have him impeached. Although heading a caretaker government, Singh proposed as many as seven ordinances on a broad range <b>of</b> <b>matters</b> from effecting changes in company law, providing state funding of elections and reservation of jobs for the backward classes. Reddy however refused to promulgate the ordinances arguing that such momentous changes could not be made by a caretaker government.|$|E
5|$|Following his defeat, McCain {{returned}} to the Senate amid varying views about what role he might play there. In mid-November 2008 he met with President-elect Obama, and the two discussed issues they had commonality on. Around the same time, McCain indicated {{that he intended to}} run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2010. As the inauguration neared, Obama consulted with McCain on a variety <b>of</b> <b>matters,</b> to an extent rarely seen between a president-elect and his defeated rival, and President Obama's inauguration speech contained an allusion to McCain's theme of finding a purpose greater than oneself.|$|E
5|$|Following the annulment, Cromwell was {{executed}} on 28 July. Cranmer now {{found himself in}} a politically prominent position, with no-one else to shoulder the burden. Throughout the rest of Henry's reign, he clung to Henry's authority. The king had total trust in him and in return, Cranmer could not conceal anything from the king. At the end of June 1541, Henry with his new wife, Catherine Howard, left for his first visit to the north of England. Cranmer was left in London {{as a member of a}} council taking care <b>of</b> <b>matters</b> for the king in his absence. His colleagues were Lord Chancellor Thomas Audley and Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford. This was Cranmer's first major piece of responsibility outside the Church. In October, while the king and queen were away, a reformer named John Lascelles revealed to Cranmer that Catherine engaged in extramarital affairs. Cranmer gave the information to Audley and Seymour and they decided to wait until Henry's return. Afraid of angering the king, Audley and Seymour suggested that Cranmer inform Henry. Cranmer slipped a message to Henry during mass on All Saints Day. An investigation revealed the truth of the marital indiscretions and Catherine {{was executed}} in February 1542.|$|E
40|$|The {{scheme of}} {{classification}} <b>of</b> kinds <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and corresponding forms of motion is proposed. It takes into account hierarchy in structure of basic units <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> and reflects evolution <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> from simple to complex forms. All basic kinds <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> may be ranged in the following evolutionary sequence: really elementary particles - hadrons - atoms - molecules - microorganisms - multicellular organisms (in particular, man) - communities of creatures (in particular, human societies) - international unions. Here units of every consequent entry of the sequence are built from ones of all previous entries (however, directly previous entry play the main role), and all units <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> are ranged in order of their origin in the evolutionary process.

5|$|The first Liverpool managers, William Edward Barclay and John McKenna, were {{appointed}} in 1892. Barclay acted as secretary-manager, overseeing the administrative {{side of the}} club, while McKenna took charge <b>of</b> <b>matters</b> on the field. The two worked in tandem as Liverpool won promotion from the Lancashire League in the club's first season. However, in 1896, McKenna appointed Tom Watson as manager. He {{went on to win}} two Football League championships. As the First World War broke out, Watson was embarking on his nineteenth season in charge at Anfield. It was to be his last, because he died in May 1915, aged 56. David Ashworth was appointed manager when football resumed after the War. Ashworth won one league title, but left for Oldham Athletic soon after this. He was replaced in February 1923 by a Liverpool director, Matt McQueen, who won one league title for the club. However, this marked the beginning of a barren spell spanning more than 20 years before Liverpool finally regained the title in 1947 under the stewardship of George Kay. Kay also led Liverpool to the FA Cup Final in 1950, but lost the game 2–0 to Arsenal. He retired the following year, owing to ill-health. The next manager, Don Welsh became the first Liverpool manager to be sacked after leading the club to relegation in 1954. His successor, Phil Taylor, also failed to win a trophy or gain promotion back to the top flight during his reign as boss.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{transition}} from an Emergent Galileon condensate phase of the early universe to a later expanding radiation phase. This "defrosting" or "preheating" transition {{is a consequence of}} the excitation <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> fluctuations by the coherent Galileon condensate, in analogy to how preheating in inflationary cosmology occurs via the excitation <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> fluctuations through coupling <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> with the coherent inflaton condensate. We show that the "minimal" coupling <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> (modeled as a massless scalar field) to the Galileon field introduced by Creminelli, Nicolis and Trincherini in order to generate a scale-invariant spectrum <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> fluctuations is sufficient to lead to efficient defrosting, provided that the effects of the non-vanishing expansion rate of the universe are taken into account. If we neglect the effects of expansion, an additional coupling <b>of</b> <b>matter</b> to the Galileon condensate is required. We study the efficiency of the defrosting mechanism in both cases.
