5|$|By 1864, Gossip was {{appearing}} in London chess circles, drawing {{a game against}} Joseph Henry Blackburne at a simultaneous exhibition in April. He played {{in a number of}} chess tournaments between 1870 and 1895, usually with unimpressive results. At London 1870, the Third British Chess Association Congress (won by John Wisker after a playoff against Amos Burn), Gossip scored two of six possible points, finishing in a tie for fifth–sixth <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>seven</b> players. He had the consolation of handing Burn his only loss. At London 1872 (won by Steinitz ahead of Johannes Zukertort and Blackburne), he scored just one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>seven,</b> finishing seventh out of eight players.|$|E

5|$|In April, the General Assembly {{called a}} border states {{convention}} {{to be held}} in Frankfort in May. Slates of delegates were nominated by both the Unionists and Southern Rightists, but war broke out before the election of delegates; the Southern Rights delegates withdrew from the election, and the Unionist slate, including Crittenden, was chosen by default. On May 27, 1861, Crittenden was chosen chair of the convention and called it to order. With war having largely precluded any good the meeting could have accomplished, only nine of Kentucky's twelve delegates were present, along with four from Missouri (<b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>seven</b> elected), and one from Tennessee (and his election was questionable); Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware sent no delegates. Ultimately, the convention accomplished little beyond calling on the southern states to reconsider their secession and on the northern states to moderate their demands.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} {{where the first}} series of Red or Black? aired, ITV gained a much larger {{audience}} share than {{it had in the}} week directly previous, where it had been beaten by BBC One on six <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>seven</b> nights. Despite this, reviews of the first series were universally negative, and additional criticism was leveled at the show when it was discovered that Nathan Hageman, the first winner of the £1m prize, had a criminal record. The Sun began a campaign calling for Hageman to return the money, but he was eventually allowed to keep it. It did, however, lead to ITV dropping three other contestants from the show, with at least one withdrawn because of their criminal record. This was also {{a major factor in the}} pre-recording of series 2.|$|E
5|$|Ohio is {{considered}} a center of science and industry, with museums dedicated to such in Columbus, COSI, the Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland, the Imagination Station in Toledo, and the Boonshoft Museum of Discovery in Dayton. The state includes many historically strong industries, such as banking and insurance, which accounts for 8% of the gross state product, motor vehicle manufacturing, research and development, and steel production, accounting for 14-17% of the nation's raw output. More traditional industries include agriculture, employing one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>seven</b> Ohioans, and new and developing sectors include bioscience, green, information, and food processing industries.

5|$|Born {{helpless}} {{and unable to}} move around (nidicolous and semi-altricial), the chicks are constantly brooded by the parents until they are 3 to 5 days old, when they can thermoregulate their body temperature. They grow their first feathers—scapulars—at 13–15 days, followed by primaries at 24–27 days, tail feathers at 30–35 days and are fully feathered by 55 days. They are attended by the parents more between the 30th and 60th days; a behavior possibly related to the greater food requirements of the chicks during those days. Semi-digested food is regurgitated and then fed to younger birds, with older birds being fed solid food. The parents {{can be seen at}} normal rates with the chicks up to about the 70th day, after which the attendance by the parents falls rapidly. Chicks receive no care after fledging, with only about one <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>seven</b> chicks receiving food after the 80th day, and almost no chicks are visited after about 90 days. After fledging, the chicks will leave the nest, with few remaining after about 100 days.|$|E

5|$|Jackson Niyomugao, {{at the age}} of 24, was {{the only}} Rwandian {{competitor}} in the London Games to have participated in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He qualified the Games after receiving a wildcard from the Olympic Solidarity Committee which was announced in the week {{before the start of the}} Olympics and was the last Rwandan athlete to attain qualification. After being eliminated from the heat stages in the previous Olympic Games in Beijing Niyomugao said he wanted to win a medal in London and that if he had more support, he would possibly be able to swim quicker but hoped to see the results. He was drawn in the second heat held on 2 August, finishing fourth <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>seven</b> swimmers, with a time of 27.38 seconds. He ranked ahead of Uganda's Ganzi Mugula (27.58 seconds) and Paul Edingue Ekane from Cameroon (27.87 seconds) but behind Ching Maou Wei of American Samoa (27.30 seconds) in a heat led by Abdourahman Osman from Djibouti (27.25 seconds). Overall Niyomugao finished 52nd out of 58 competitors overall, but did not progress to the semi-finals because her time was 5.11 seconds slower than the slowest swimmer who made the later stages.|$|E
5|$|On 21 June, the HV {{attacked}} RSK {{positions at}} the Miljevci Plateau, located in the pink zone north of Šibenik. The TO forces in the area were subordinated to the 1st Brigade of the TO, and Lieutenant Colonel General Milan Torbica. The HV deployed 250 troops, elements of the 113th and 142nd Infantry Brigades, commanded by Brigadier Kruno Mazalin. The HV had infiltrated the pink zone along three routes—via Nos Kalik, across the Čikola river and by boat sailing upstream along the Krka River, during the night of 20/21 June. The fighting began at 5a.m. as the HV force, deployed in 26 squads, captured six <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>seven</b> villages on the plateau {{by the end of}} the morning. At 8:00p.m., the HV captured the village of Ključ, and all of the plateau. The advance created a HV-held salient south of Knin, several kilometres deep. It also led the RSK artillery to bombard Šibenik and HV bombardment of Knin in response, both on 22 June.|$|E
5|$|The Time of Our Lives is {{the first}} {{extended}} play (EP) by American recording artist Miley Cyrus.
