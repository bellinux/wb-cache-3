Nelson later wrote in his autobiography, [...] "I think it's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> albums, but Yesterday's Wine was regarded by RCA as way too spooky and far out to waste promotion money on."

500|$|Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez {{was adamant}} that opponents Chelsea were the team {{under the most}} {{pressure}} to win the match: [...] "There will be more pressure on them, they {{have spent a lot}} of money and are the best team in the league, because they are in first position, but they've lost their last two important games. That means they will be under pressure. People will see them as the favourites, I'm sure, so the pressure is on them and not us." [...] Benítez was confident that playing in a cup final would be beneficial to his players: [...] "We need experiences like this to progress, when I decided to come here I said I wanted to win trophies. Our challenge is to win the Premier League, the Champions League, the Uefa Cup, the FA Cup and the Carling Cup. This is a chance to start."

Everything was the same, boring, homogenized, contrived shit." [...] Upon finding Sednaoui's reel, however, Kiedis noticed it was [...] "like nothing else.

[...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God!

2500|$|In {{a topical}} 1973 storyline, Erica aborts the baby she conceives {{with her first}} husband, Jeff Martin (Charles Frank). This is the first legal {{abortion}} aired on American television since the landmark Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling. However, Maude Findlay had an abortion on Maude the year before, after New York legalized the practice. Erica was chosen for this storyline {{as a way to}} prevent controversy. Since she was a bad girl and not one of the heroines, her choice would not be viewed as something the show supported. The show also protected themselves from controversy by writing Erica as mentally blocking out the abortion and, for a time, believing she miscarried. Viewers loved the story and Erica became a symbol of free choice. Erica develops a potentially fatal infection after having the abortion. [...] "Erica's abortion was simply because she didn't want to have a child, and I think if you do that now, you would perhaps hurt your character," [...] said former All My Children head writer Megan McTavish. McTavish later rewrote the story so the doctor, Greg Madden (Ian Buchanan), transplants the aborted fetus into his infertile wife. They raise the child, Josh Madden (Colin Egglesfield), as their son without Erica's knowledge. Inkling Magazine pointed out how unrealistic this storyline was because [...] "the techniques by which abortion is performed don't exactly lend themselves to excising an embryo viable enough to survive in another woman's womb." [...] The magazine said more likelihood existed in the possibility that Madden harvested Erica's eggs during the procedure, though an invasive surgery like that going unnoticed appeared unlikely as well. Egglesfield gained different information on the probability of the story. In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, he said, [...] "Actually, my father is an obstetrician/gynecologist and my brother is a doctor, as is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> friends, and their collective opinion is that this is possible; it is possible to take a fetus out of one woman and place it into the womb of another woman, but it's only possible within the first week of pregnancy, before the fetus actually starts attaching itself to the uterine lining." [...] In the storyline, Greg harbors an obsession with Erica, which motivates him to choose her for the transplant in the first place. Greg and Josh make their first appearances in 2005. Greg's wife recently died and he moves to Pine Valley for closer proximity to Erica under the guise of opening a clinic. Josh follows him soon afterward and, not knowing Erica is his mother, attempts to destroy Erica in order to steal her fame for himself. Erica discovers the truth and is eventually able to form a relationship with him. In 2009, All My Children let Egglesfield go and killed off Josh. Zach Slater (Thorsten Kaye) shoots him and Erica is then forced {{to decide whether or not}} to donate Josh's heart to a seriously ill Kendall. [...] "The first thought that came to my mind when I was told the storyline and read the script was Sophie's Choice," [...] said Lucci. Erica reluctantly agrees to the transplant. Lucci said she believed this decision would [...] "haunt" [...] Erica because, if Kendall's life was not in the balance, she would have put more effort into saving Josh.|$|E
