Tying is a process by which a particular part of cloth is prevented from the process of dyeing. The skin diseases in workers engaged in the &#x 2032;tie and dye&#x 2032; industry have not been extensively studied. Aims : To study the prevalence of contact dermatitis among workers engaged in the &#x 2032;tie and dye&#x 2032; industries in and around Jodhpur (Western Rajasthan). Methods : One thousand three hundred workers engaged in &#x 2032;tie and dye&#x 2032; work were evaluated for occupation-related dermatitis. Those with skin lesions were subjected to patch tests using 2 &#x 0025; aqueous solution of the dyes and chemicals commonly used by them. These included direct dyes, VAT dyes, sulfur <b>dyes</b> and <b>azo</b> <b>dyes.</b> Fifty workers without skin lesions served as controls. Results : One hundred patients (7. 69 &#x 0025;) had dermatitis involving the exposed sites, mainly the hands and forearms. Eighty-one patients showed positive reactions to one or more dyes, most commonly Red RC <b>base</b> (<b>azo</b> <b>dye),</b> followed by naphthol.

These enzymes are multicopper phenol oxidases that decolorize <b>azo</b> <b>dyes</b> through a highly non-specific free radical mechanism forming phenolic type compounds, thereby avoiding the formation of toxic aromatic amines [4, 5]. In the literature, there are a large number of papers reporting on decolorization of <b>azo</b> <b>dyes</b> however the fate of the products of <b>azo</b> <b>dye</b> laccase reactions is ignored [6 - 8].

However, currently used wastewater treatment technologies such as activated sludge systems, anaerobic digestion, electrochemical destruction, adsorption and membrane filtration are ineffective in removing <b>azo</b> <b>dyes</b> due to reasons such as inefficient dye degradation, slow degradation kinetics, toxic metabolite formation, inhibitory costs and generation of secondary waste streams. Therefore, in this study, microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were studied as possible systems that could effectively degrade <b>azo</b> <b>dyes</b> with an additional benefit of concomitant biogenic electricity generation. The co-metabolic degradation of the model <b>azo</b> <b>dye</b> Acid Orange- 7 (AO- 7) using Shewanella oneidensis and mixed anaerobic cultures in MFC was carried out with particular emphasis on AO- 7 degradation kinetics in the initial study. The effect of using various carbon sources including cheaper complex ones such as molasses and corn steep liquor as electron donors for <b>azo</b> <b>dye</b> degradation in MFCs was also investigated. The outcomes of this study demonstrated that fast AO- 7 reductive degradation kinetics using cheap, sustainable co-substrate types can be achieved with concomitant bioelectricity generation in two-chamber MFCs.

Maximum power densities up-to 52 mWm- 2 were observed during <b>azo</b> <b>dye</b> degradation. A modular scale-up version (with a volumetric scale-up factor of 6) of the two stage integrated bioreactor system demonstrated the capability to efficiently treat two types of real wastewater originating from colour industry without any apparent deterioration of reactor performance in terms of dye decolourisation and COD removal. The use of applied external resistance (Rext) and redox mediators as tools for enhancing <b>azo</b> <b>dye</b> degradation kinetics in dual chamber MFCs was studied. The outcomes of this work suggest that <b>azo</b> <b>dye</b> reductive degradation kinetics in MFC anodes can be influenced by varying Rext.

In turn, hydroxyl radicals react with <b>azo</b> <b>dyes,</b> thus leading to their mineralization into CO(2) and H(2) O. The chemical composition of the <b>azo</b> <b>dyes</b> and their degradation products during electrolysis were monitored by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The following degradation products were identified: hydroquinone, 1, 4 -benzoquinone, pyrocatechol, 4 -nitrocatechol, 1, 3, 5 -trihydroxynitrobenzene and p-nitrophenol. Degradation of the initial <b>azo</b> <b>dyes</b> was assessed by the measurement of the chemical oxygen demand (COD). Kinetic analysis of these data showed a pseudo-first order degradation reaction for all <b>azo</b> <b>dyes.</b> A pathway of {{degradation of}} <b>azo</b> <b>dyes</b> is proposed. Specifically, the degradation of dyes and intermediates proceeds by oxidation of azo bonds and aromatic ring by hydroxyl radicals. The results display {{the efficiency of the}} ElectroFenton process to degrade organic matter...|$|R
40|$|Under {{anaerobic}} conditions the sulfonated <b>azo</b> <b>dye</b> Mordant Yellow 3 was {{reduced by the}} biomass of a bacterial consortium grown aerobically with 6 -aminonaphthalene- 2 -sulfonic acid. Stoichiometric amounts of the aromatic amines 6 -aminonaphthalene- 2 -sulfonate and 5 -aminosalicylate were generated and excreted into the medium. After re-aeration of the culture, these amines were mineralized by different members of the bacterial culture. Thus, total degradation of a sulfonated <b>azo</b> <b>dye</b> was achieved by using an alternating anaerobic-aerobic treatment. The ability of the mixed bacterial culture to reduce the <b>azo</b> <b>dye</b> was correlated {{with the presence of}} strain BN 6, which possessed the ability to oxidize various naphthalenesulfonic acids. It is suggested that strain BN 6 has a transport system for naphthalenesulfonic acids which also catalyzes uptake of sulfonated <b>azo</b> <b>dyes.</b> These dyes are then gratuitously reduced in the cytoplasm by unspecific reductases...|$|R
