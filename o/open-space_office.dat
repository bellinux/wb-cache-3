The standard PMV indices [1] have been calculated considering also {{the effect of the}} diffuse and beam solar radiation directly reaching the occupants through the windows. Although the use of shades always improves the thermal comfort, the energy demand could increase as an effect of the internal position of shades in combination with particular orientations and glazing types...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of energy {{consumption}} reduction, this paper focuses on the application of Model Predictive Control to occupants' thermal comfort together with indoor air quality control while improving the whole building energy efficiency. First, an <b>open-space</b> <b>office</b> split in three zones, located in Cork Institute of Technology, is modeled. A centralized MPC is designed to control the temperature and $CO_ 2 $ concentration in the three zones. Then, a distributed version of the MPC, with three separate local controllers, is considered. Finally, simulation {{results show that the}} distributed MPC solution achieves control performance quite close to the centralized version with less computing effort...|$|E
40|$|According to the Fanger’s comfort theory, the {{individual}} thermal sensation is mainly {{connected with the}} thermal balance of the human body. This balance and the related comfort indicators (the Predicted Mean Vote, PMV, and the correlated Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied, PPD) depend on four environmental parameters (air temperature, humidity and velocity, and internal envelope mean radiant temperature) and two variables connected with the human being (physical activity and clothing). Differently from the other environmental parameters under the system control, the mean radiant temperature is strongly conditioned by the envelope characteristics, and in particular, {{by the presence of}} glazed surfaces whose insulating performance is commonly lower than the one of opaque components. Transparent components also admit solar radiation into the indoor environment, affecting the thermal balance of the building and of the occupants. In this paper, the heating and cooling energy needs of an <b>open-space</b> <b>office</b> with different windows’ characteristics have been analyzed under controlled internal comfort conditions. A set of configurations given by different windows' glazing systems, area, disposition and orientation has been simulated, considering the climatic conditions of Paris, Milan and Rome. The passive energy performance of the different glazing solutions has then been compared accounting for the long-term comfort conditions (on seasonal basis). The time distribution of the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and the Discomfort Time weighted by the Predicted Percent of Dissatisfied (WDTPPD) are analyzed, including also the effect of the diffuse and beam solar radiation directly reaching the occupants through the windows...|$|E
40|$|Open-space {{labs and}} {{research}} environments are increasingly common worldwide. They {{are supposed to}} facilitate interactions among researchers, but can be disruptive {{to those who need}} to be in a quiet environment in order to concentrate. This problem is increasingly felt across the natural, medical and social sciences, has a clear interdisciplinary and cross-cultural relevance, but {{has been the focus of}} limited attention. We propose some simple suggestions for researchers struggling in an open-space lab, based on a literature review and our experience in open spaces in various labs and countries (Australia, China, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK and the USA) as undergrads, PhD students, postdocs, researchers and (W. van der Werf) professors. Our aim is to help researchers working in <b>open-space</b> <b>offices</b> and labs with some straightforward solutions that will make their lives and work easier. </p...|$|R
40|$|Classical room {{acoustic}} simulation methods {{based on}} the principles of geometrical acoustics (GA) have nowadays become an accepted and highly developed tool for acoustic practitioners and researchers in predicting the acoustic characteristics of large rooms like concert halls, theatres or <b>open-space</b> <b>offices.</b> However, when it comes to small rooms, even the most advanced geometrically based methods appear to be flawed due to the inherent negligence of important low frequency wave effects, such as standing waves, diffraction and interference. In order to overcome this limitation the present thesis investigates the potential benefits of the application of the Finite Element Method (FEM) to the modally dominated part of the sound field. However, {{despite the fact that the}} FEM is a well-established tool in engineering sciences, which fully captures all relevant wave effects, its application to room acoustics introduces far-reaching and yet unresolved questions regarding the realistic source, boundary and receiver representation. The present thesis therefore establishes a complete framework for the combination of FE and GA-based room acoustic simulation results and discusses the inherent challenges and limitations including all aspects of sound generation, sound reflection and sound reception. Moreover, the thesis establishes detailed guidelines for the best-possible determination of all necessary input data for both simulation domains. The investigations conducted in the course of this thesis aim at two different goals. On the one hand the thesis investigates the influence of selected isolated aspects regarding their influence on the simulation accuracy. In particular, these topics include a study on the potential of the image source method to predict the modal characteristics of the low frequency Room Transfer Function (RTF), a study on the efficient modelling of porous absorbers in the FE domain and finally a study on the possible low frequency coupling of the excitation velocity of a loudspeaker to the sound field at the loudspeaker membrane. On the other hand the thesis investigates the overall potential of the presented combined approach by conducting extensive objective and subjective comparisons of measurement and simulation results for three types of acoustically relevant small spaces (a scale-model reverberation room, a recording studio and two different car passenger compartments). For each room considerable efforts have been made to obtain a best-possible a-priori assessment of all necessary material and source data for the simulations. However, especially with regard to the determination of the acoustic surface impedances at the room boundaries certain inevitable inaccuracies have to be accepted. While the presented results reveal an overall good agreement regarding the energy distribution in time and frequency domain for all considered rooms, the results clearly show that as expected the simulation accuracy considerably degrades with increasing complexity of the room geometry and boundary conditions. Moreover, it is important to mention that even with the FEM a precise prediction of the fine structure of the RTF appears impossible in the frequency range far above the Schroeder frequency. It can thus be concluded, that possible fields of application of the FE extension in room acoustic simulations lie in the prediction of the modally dominated low frequency part of the RTF of well defined rooms and in the prediction of sound fields that are strongly affected by near-field or diffraction effects as in the car passenger compartment. Thus, despite the general potential of the low frequency FE extension to realistically predict the modal structure of the low frequency part of the RTF, the Achilles’ heel of room acoustic FE simulations appears to be the determination of realistic impedance conditions on the room boundaries. Consequently the application of the finite element method to room acoustic applications calls for improved measurement techniques for the acoustic surface impedance...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{presence}} of large window surfaces could be preferable during the heating season when solar gains through the glazed components can overcome heating losses from the same surfaces, during the cooling season more attention has to be paid in order to limit the inlet of solar radiation which causes the increment of cooling load. Generally the optimal tradeoff for energy optimization, as already underlined in a previous paper by the authors, is using low thermal transmittance and high solar factor glazing, even if higher solar transmittance considerably worsens the cooling performance. However, the choice of glazing type and the design of windows on a façade may depend on comfort consideration besides energetic evaluations. Thermal sensation of an individual is mainly related to the whole thermal balance of the human body. Comfort limits can in this case be expressed by two indexes proposed by Fanger in 1970 : the Predicted Mean Vote, PMV, and the correlated Predicted Percentage of Dissatisfied, PPD. The PMV depends on four environmental parameters (air temperature, air humidity, air velocity and mean radiant temperature) and two variables connected with human being (physical activity and clothing). The air temperature, the air humidity and the air velocity inside a building are directly under the system control. In contrast, the mean radiant temperature is strongly conditioned by the envelope surface temperature, and in particular, by {{the presence}} of glazed surfaces whose insulating performance is lower than the opaque components one. In this paper the study of heating and cooling energy needs of an <b>open-space</b> <b>office</b> with different windows’ characteristics has been carried out controlling the internal comfort conditions with appropriate setpoint of the system. An office module with windows on a single façade, or on opposite façades, oriented towards 3 different orientations has been simulated, varying the glazed area (2 sizes), the glazing systems (4 types) and considering three localities of central and southern Europe. The PMV have been calculated for each hour of occupation of the whole year assuming two season as regards the setpoint conditions and clothing level. Calculations have then been repeated considering also the effect of the diffuse and beam solar radiation through the windows directly reaching the occupants. The evaluation of the long-term comfort conditions (on seasonal basis) has been conducted considering some statistical indicators of distribution (the median, minimum, maximum and the interquartile range) and the energy performance of the different glazing solution have been compared accounting for the comfort one...|$|E
40|$|Solar {{radiation}} plays {{a significant}} role in reducing building energy consumption for air-conditioning and lighting and affects thermal and visual comfort conditions. Additionally, for the occupants of confined spaces, daylight strongly affects not only the human performance but also the general well-being, both from a psychological and physiological point of view. On the other hand, large windows on building façades may facilitate the entry of daylight and solar heat gains, increasing the risks of overheating or visual discomfort. In these cases, the proper use and control of shading devices is mandatory to prevent glare and direct solar radiation on the occupants, even while affecting the energy performance. The best balance between those contrasting requisites has to be defined by comparing the behavior of different combinations of glazing systems and shading devices, while considering the specific application context. In the assessment, different metrics are needed to analyze both comfort and energy aspects. In this paper, the effects of external and internal roller shades, both on thermal and visual comfort and on overall building energy demand, have been considered for the climatic conditions of Rome. An <b>open-space</b> <b>office</b> with windows distributed on a single façade or on opposite façades, and directed towards 2 orientations (South or South/North and East or East/West) has been simulated. The window area and the glazing system have been changed in order to evaluate the shading performance in several office configurations. The thermal comfort indoor conditions have been controlled by fixing adequate operative temperature set points. Shades with three different levels of solar and light transmission coefficients have been chosen for the comparison. To fulfill occupant visual comfort, the shades are controlled based on two set points: on a limit glare index of 22 DGI and on the maximum total solar radiation incident on the windows - 150 W m- 2. An illuminance level of 500 lux during the hours of occupation is guaranteed by dimmable artificial lighting. Concerning the energy performance, the office primary energy demand for heating, cooling and lighting have been calculated. The assessment of the long-term comfort conditions has been conducted on a seasonal basis, taking into account both the thermal and visual comfort conditions. Regarding thermal comfort, the Discomfort Time weighted by the Predicted Percent of Dissatisfied (WDTPPD) and the radiant temperature asymmetry have been calculated in 9 points in the office including also the effect of the diffuse and beam solar radiation directly reaching the occupants. The visual comfort has been assessed through three climate-based metrics: the Spatial Daylight Autonomy (sDA), which describes the annual sufficiency of ambient daylight levels, the Annual Sunlight Exposure (ASE), which describes the annual potential risk of visual discomfort in interior work environments and the Daylight Glare Probability (DGP), which is the percentage of disturbed people. The dynamic simulation has been conducted in EnergyPlus 8, while the visual aspects have been analyzed with DaySim and equivalent lighting simulation codes...|$|E
