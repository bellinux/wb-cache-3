40|$|Between-visit {{variability}} of small airway <b>obstruction</b> <b>markers</b> {{in patients with}} asthma To the Editor: Clinical trials in patients with airway diseases often use forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) as the sole physiological outcome measure. However, FEV 1 {{is thought to be}} insensitive to obstruction of the smaller airways, which may be particularly relevant in asthma [1]. Putative markers of small airway obstruction include measures of airway resistance using impulse oscillometry (IOS) [2] and indices of ventilation heterogeneity derived from multiple-breath inert gas washout (MBW) [3]. We recently showed that increased airway resistance at 5 Hz (R 5) and 20 Hz (R 20) is associated with worse asthma control and more frequent exacerbations [4], and FARAH et al. [5] demonstrated that MBW parameters may be responsive to asthma therapy. In order to conduct clinical trials using these alternative outcome measures, it is necessary to be assured of their repeatability and stability over time. Moreover, an estimate of between-visit variability in the stable state is required so that sample size calculations can be performed. We therefore aimed to determine th...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose]	 Balance	deficits	are	increasingly	recognized	in	chronic	obstructive	pulmonary	disease,	 {{but little}} is	known	regarding	this	issue	in	asthma. Our	primary	aim	was	to	assess	the	correlation	between	postural	bal-ance and	pulmonary	function	in	adults	with	asthma. Secondarily,	 we	aimed	to	correlate	balance	with	functional {{capacity}} and	body	mass	index	in	these	subjects. [Methods]	 A	cross-sectional	study	of	 26 	adults	with	asthma	was performed in	which	 they	were	 subjected	 to	 stabilometry,	 pulmonary	 function	 testing,	 a	 6 -minute	walking	 test, and nutritional	assessment. [Results]	 We	found	significant	correlations	of	forced	expiratory	volume	at	one	second (ρ=− 0. 49) 	 and	total	lung	capacity	(ρ= 0. 39) 	 with	mediolateral	displacement	with	feet	apart/eyes	open. Significant correlations were	observed	between	peak	expiratory	flow	and	a	number	of	stabilometric	parameters. There	were several significant	correlations	between	airway-specific	conductance	and	 the	 tasks	performed	on	 the	 force	plat-form,	 especially	one	with	the	feet	apart/eyes	open. The	Berg	Balance	Scale	revealed	significant	correlations	with mediolateral displacement,	 mediolateral	range,	 and	anteroposterior	range	for	feet	together/eyes	closed	(ρ=− 0. 49). There were	no	significant	correlations	between	stabilometry,	 body	mass	index,	 and	six-minute	walking	distance. [Conclusion]	 In	adults	with	asthma,	 there	is	an	association	between	balance	and	the	bronchial	<b>obstruction</b>	<b>markers.</b> This finding	may	contribute	to	improvement	of	rehabilitation	programs	for	these	subjects...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Background: Chitinase {{may play}} a role in {{regulating}} allergic diseases. Objective: We stud-ied the role of chitinase in a mouse model exposed to diesel exhaust particles (DEP). Mice were exposed to intranasal DEP (0. 6 mg/mL) for 5 days and challenged with aerosolized DEP (6 mg/m 3) on days 6 – 8. Enhanced pause (Penh), as an airway <b>obstruction</b> <b>marker,</b> was measured on day 9, and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissues were collected on day 10. The expression of Ym 1 and Ym 2 mRNA was assessed in lung tissue extracts by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results: DEP induced significant increases in methacholine-induced Penh and IL- 4 levels in BAL fluid relative to the control group. Peribronchial and perivascular inflammatory cell infiltrates were prominent in the DEP group. DEP induced Ym 1 and Ym 2 mRNA expression in lung tissue extracts relative to the control group. -Conclusion: These results demonstrate that DEP induced airway hyperresponsiveness and Ym mRNA expression via a Th 2 cell-biased response, suggesting that chitinase {{may play a}}n important role in airway inflammation and responsiveness upon exposure to DEP in a mouse model, and may therefore b...|$|R

40|$|Background: We {{previously}} built a pollen {{challenge test}} unit (allergen challenge chamber: ACC) to collect objective data about Japanese cedar pollinosis. In this study, we investigated adequate conditions for pollen challenge using the ACC. Methods: The {{study consisted of}} two parts. The first part was conducted in November, which is not in pollen season. Subjects were exposed to Japanese cedar pollen at a concentration of 50, 000 grains/m 3 in the chamber for 120 min each day {{over the course of}} three consecutive days. The second part was conducted in April, which is just after pollen season. Subjects were exposed to Japanese cedar pollen at the same concentration (50, 000 grains/m 3) in the chamber for 90 min on a single day. Subjects recorded nasal and ocular symptoms before challenge and every 15 min after challenge initiation. The minimum cross-sectional area in the nasal cavity was measured using acoustic rhinometry before and after challenge as an indicator of nasal <b>obstruction.</b> Inflammatory <b>markers</b> in nasal lavage fluid and serum were also measured before and after challenge. Results: Nasal and ocular symptoms were significantly exacerbated after challenge on all days of the single and 3 -consecutive-day challenge tests, particularly on the third day of the consecutive challenge test. Nasal and ocular symptoms were also quickly induced with challenge immediately after the end of pollen season. No significant changes in inflammatory markers were seen. Conclusions: Care is needed with regard to pollen challenge conditions in the ACC, including timing of the challenge, to induce pollinosis symptoms that accurately reflect chronic inflammation...|$|R

Airflow limitation, i. e. reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 -s (FEV 1), is associated with increased prevalence of atherosclerosis, however, causal mechanisms remain elusive. The objective {{of the study was}} to determine if the association between airflow <b>obstruction</b> and <b>markers</b> of atherosclerosis is mediated by systemic inflammation. 1154 subjects from the longitudinal AGES Reykjavik study were included. Population characteristics, systemic inflammation markers from blood (white blood cell counts (WBC) and level of C-reactive protein (CRP)) were compared between patients with and without airflow limitation defined by reduced FEV 1 on spirometry. Atherosclerosis burden was quantified by measurements of coronary artery calcium, aortic arch and distal aortic calcification in addition to carotid intimal media thickness (CIMT). Subjects were split into four groups according to smoking status and whether airflow limitation was present. There was a higher overall burden of atherosclerosis in ever-smokers compared to never-smokers, and in individuals with airflow obstruction compared to individuals without airflow obstruction. After adjusting for population characteristics, Framingham cardiovascular risk factors and markers of systemic inflammation (WBC and CRP), there was a significantly increased aortic arch and distal aorta calcification and higher CIMT measurement in individuals with airflow obstruction compared to individuals without airflow obstruction. After adjusting for population characteristics, Framingham cardiovascular risk factors and markers of systemic inflammation (WBC and CRP), there was a significantly increased aortic arch and distal aorta calcification and higher CIMT measurement in individuals with airflow obstruction compared to individuals without airflow obstruction. Systemic inflammation (WBC and CRP) does not appear to mediate the association between airflow limitation and atherosclerosis. Only airflow limitation and not systemic inflammation (WBC and CRP) appears to be an independent predictor of atherosclerosis...|$|R
40|$|International audienceNon-invasive {{prognosis}} of {{the clinical}} progression of disease is of high interest, especially in newborn and children. Neonatal ureteropelvic (UPJ) junction obstruction needs close and invasive surveillance to determine the necessity of pyeloplasty. A number of groups have initiated research with the aim to find non-invasive biomarkers for UPJ obstruction. Two different strategies have been followed. One strategy, based on the knowledge obtained in animal models of UPJ obstruction, has {{identified a number of}} individual urinary markers of severe UPJ <b>obstruction.</b> Combining these <b>markers</b> might allow prediction of which patients will require surgery and in which patients UPJ obstruction will spontaneously resolve. The other strategy is based on urinary proteomics. In this strategy the entire urinary proteome is probed for a set of biomarkers that correlates with the degree of UPJ obstruction. In subsequent steps, these sets of urinary biomarkers are used for prediction {{of the clinical}} evolution of UPJ obstruction patients. This proteomic-based strategy allowed prediction, several months in advance, of the clinical evolution of neonates with UPJ-obstruction. Both strategies will be complementary and will hopefully replace in the near future the invasive follow-up of newborns with UPJ obstruction...|$|R
