40|$|Building {{design and}} {{construction}} has found many interested parties in nearly all {{sectors of the economy}} of the Indonesia. Various studies in developed countries have indicated that one method of improving construction project performance is by managing the construction waste. Project performance can be improved by reducing the unnecessary costs related to waste disposal and excess materials. However, the issues of construction waste have not been a main concern of construction project stakeholders in Indonesia. The Civil Engineering Department of the University of Indonesia has initiated the study on construction waste management in Indonesia. This paper discusses the results from one of the study, which is on construction waste minimization strategy. The main objective of construction waste minimization strategy is {{to reduce the amount of}} waste produced, which will lead to more cost effective project operation. This is based on concept that reduced construction waste can: save project cost, reduce excess materials, improve competitiveness, improve work habit, and improve quality of project environment. Construction waste minimization strategy can be implemented at 4 construction areas, namely project planning, preconstruction, off-site <b>activities</b> and <b>on-site</b> <b>activities.</b> A case study was conducted on a high-rise building project, which integrates its <b>on-site</b> <b>activities</b> on construction waste minimization into the house-keeping management of the project site. By doing this, the contractor achieve cleaner, more organized & tidier project site. In the <b>on-site</b> <b>activities,</b> improved work productivity, and more cost effective project...|$|R
30|$|The carbon {{emissions}} data {{are based on}} the greenhouse gas emission inventory 2005 published by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency (2008). As noted earlier, {{there are two kinds of}} emissions: on-site input (fuel) emissions and <b>on-site</b> <b>activity</b> emissions. For the former, the Australian Greenhouse Emissions Information System provided emission data by sector and by fuel type. We map these data into the 35 sectors (and commodities) in our study. Based on this emission matrix and the absorption (input demand) matrix for industries, we can calculate the emission intensities by industry and by commodity—input emission intensities. The remaining emissions—the total emissions minus the fuel input emissions—are treated as the activity emissions, and they are assumed to be directly related to the level of output in each industry. We take the level of output for each industry from the MAKE matrix of the I–O tables, and we can then calculate activity emission intensities. For households, we assume their emissions are proportional to household consumption, and using the data on household consumption by commodity in the I–O table, we can calculate the consumption emission intensities.|$|E
40|$|Objective of the Study: The {{objective}} {{of the study is}} to gain in-depth understanding of the meanings and perceptions of on-site sponsorship activities for three key interest groups: sponsors, event organizers and the audience. The study aims for establishing the role of on-site sponsorship activities as a unique sponsorship leverage tool for creating interaction between the sponsor and event audience. Another objective is to create a framework to illustrate the effect mechanism of on-site sponsorship activities. The third objective is to use the framework to give advice for Uplause management to improve Uplause Crowd Games as an on-site sponsorship activity. Research Method: The research is based on a constructivist paradigm that defines knowledge as a mutually constructed context-related reality. The existing academic sponsorship discussions form the theoretical framework of the study and work as a guideline for the empirical research. The empirical research is executed by semi-structured interviews, which is the most appropriate method considering the paradigm and the specific research setting. The interviewees represent all three interest groups of Karjala Cup 2010, where Uplause Crowd Games were used as an on-site sponsorship activity. The data is then analyzed using a thematic analysis method and a revised framework is built. Findings: The research findings are divided in three parts: 1) <b>on-site</b> <b>activity</b> effect, 2) event organizer’s roles, and 3) practical tips for improving Uplause Crowd Games. The most important finding suggests that on-site activities are able to provide additional value for the audience in form of entertainment and, thus, lead to enhanced goodwill towards the sponsor and extended involvement towards the sponsored event...|$|E
40|$|In Malaysia, the {{greenhouse}} gases (GHGs) emissions reduction via composting of source-separated organic waste (SOW) in {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) has not been assessed. Assessment of GHG emissions reduction via composting of SOW is important as environmental impacts from waste management are waste-specific and local-specific. The study presents the case study for potential carbon reduction via composting of SOW in University of Malaya (UM). In this study, a series of calculations were {{used to evaluate the}} GHG emission of different SOW management scenarios. The calculations based on IPCC calculation methods (AM 0025) include GHGs emissions from landfilling, fuel consumption in transportation and SOW composting activity. The methods were applied to assess the GHG emissions from five alternative SOW management scenarios in UM. From the baseline scenario (S 0), a total of 1, 636. 18 tCO 2 e was generated. In conjunction with target of 22 % recycling rate, as shown in S 1, 14 % reduction in potential GHG emission can be achieved. The carbon reduction can be further enhanced by increasing the SOW composting capacity. The net GHG emission for S 1, S 2, S 3 and S 4 were 1, 399. 52, 1, 161. 29, 857. 70 and 1, 060. 48 tCO 2 e, respectively. In general, waste diversion for composting proved a significant net GHG emission reduction as shown in S 3 (47 %), S 4 (35 %) and S 2 (29 %). Despite the emission due to direct <b>on-site</b> <b>activity,</b> the significant reduction in methane generation at landfill has reduced the net GHG emission.

40|$|Interpretation {{has been}} adopted at both natural and {{cultural}} sites as a soft visitor management tool where typically it might aim to develop an {{understanding and appreciation of}} the site as well as encouraging the appropriate on-site behaviour from the visitors. This study is primarily concerned with the on-site experience of the visitor through which interpretation in its many forms can play such a critical component. The study has explored the visitors’ choice of <b>on-site</b> <b>activities</b> as well as the overall range of on-site interpretive experiences available at two locations on the Jurassic Coast World Heritage site in Dorset and in so doing, has specifically explored the visitors’ interest in and attitude towards guided walks. A principle outcome of this study therefore has been the development of a framework for the potential design of guided walks which could be used to support the successful enhancement of the visitor experience on any natural site. The primary research undertaken in this study included a visitor survey which was conducted during 2007 and yielded a total of 600 groups of respondents. In undertaking the analysis of the data, three variables were identified as being worthy of greater exploration. Two of these ‘outcome’ variables had two states namely for; ‘residency’ (local resident or tourist) and ‘visitation’ (first or repeat visitor) whilst the third ‘outcome’ variable which was ‘social grouping’ had three potential states namely ‘alone’, ‘with partner’ and ‘with family / friends’. The analysis which included logistic regression modelling was applied to the data in order to explore the principle differences {{in the way in which}} the visitors within each of these three grouping variables responded to the questionnaire.
