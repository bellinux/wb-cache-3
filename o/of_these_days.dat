Diệm, notorious for monologues that often lasted {{for up to six}} hours, talked endlessly and as a result the American diplomats were unable to raise whatever issues they had wanted to discuss.|$|E

25|$|Until 1929, {{regional}} {{labor union}} councils or local governments were authorized {{to set up}} additional public holidays, totaling to up to 10 days a year.

25|$|The nomadic phase begins around 10 {{days after}} the queen lays her eggs. This phase will last {{approximately}} 15 days to let the larvae develop. The ants move during the day, capturing insects, spiders, and small vertebrates to feed their brood. At dusk, they will form their nests or bivouac, which they change almost daily. At {{the end of the}} nomadic phase, the larvae will spin pupal cases and no longer require food. The colony can then live in the same bivouac site for around 20 days, foraging only on approximately two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>days.</b> Among the army ants are some species that venture out only at night, but no adequate studies of their activities have been made.|$|E

This Mass was not included in editions of the Roman Missal before the time of Pope Pius XII. In this Mass, the bishop blesses separate oils for the sick (used in Anointing of the Sick), for catechumens (used in Baptism) and chrism (used in Baptism, but especially in Confirmation and Holy Orders, as well as in rites such as the dedication of an altar and a church).|$|E

25|$|The {{increased}} {{sensitivity of}} the site meant that in 1996 the Wye River Accords, part of the Arab-Israeli peace process, included a temporary status agreement for the site restricting access for both Jews and Muslims. As part of this agreement, the waqf (Islamic charitable trust) controls 81% of the building. This includes {{the whole of the}} southeastern section, which lies above the only known entrance to the caves and possibly over the entirety of the caves themselves. In consequence, Jews are not permitted to visit the Cenotaphs of Isaac or Rebecca, which lie entirely within the southeastern section, except for 10 days a year that hold special significance in Judaism. One <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>days</b> is the Shabbat Chayei Sarah, when the Torah portion concerning the death of Sarah and the purchase by Abraham of the land in which the caves are situated, is read.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} ritual {{practices}} and beliefs {{are associated with}} birth among the Tanala. In the past, after delivery of a baby the mother would wash {{her hands in the}} blood of a freshly sacrificed chicken, bathe herself in hot water, and then rest upright beside a fire to make her sweat out impurities. The period that she needed to stay beside the fire varied; noblewomen might stay beside the fire for as long as several months, but more commonly the duration was eight days. Immediately after this period beside the fire was concluded, a party was held, which the mother had to attend regardless of her condition; the event was marked by the slaughter of zebu. Immediately after birth, the baby would be bathed in cold water, and a sorcerer would declare certain days to be lifelong fady (taboo days); if a baby was born on a day that was fady for both the mother and father, the child would be abandoned to die. In addition, there are eight fady days per month for all Tanala, and historically if a child was born on one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> it would be drowned by holding its head in a water-filled winnowing pan.|$|E
