5|$|A {{dispute over}} the {{succession}} to Edward led to the Norman conquest of England in 1066, accomplished by an army led by Duke William of Normandy.

5|$|Ambrose Dudley, 3rd Earl of Warwick, KG (c.1530 – 21February 1590) was an English nobleman and general, and {{an elder}} brother of Queen Elizabeth I's favourite, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. Their father was John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, {{who led the}} English {{government}} from 15501553 under Edward VI and unsuccessfully tried to establish Lady Jane Grey <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> throne after the King's death in July 1553. For his participation in this venture Ambrose Dudley was imprisoned in the Tower of London and condemned to death. Reprieved, his rehabilitation came after he fought for Philip II of Spain (then England's co-monarch) in the Battle of St. Quentin.|$|E
5|$|As urban populations grew, major neo-Gothic {{churches were}} built to {{accommodate}} them. After {{the passing of}} the Catholic Relief Act, James Gillespie Graham designed St Andrew's Roman Catholic Chapel in Glasgow (1814–17). There was also growth in the Episcopal Church, which benefited from the mainly Anglican migrant English workers. In Edinburgh these were modelled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> Perpendicular, as at St Paul's York Place (1816–18), the towered St John's Chapel (1816–18) and St David's (Ramshorn) (1824–26). In Glasgow, the Ramshorn Kirk's has a T-plan and symmetrical front with tall tower.|$|E
5|$|Derfflingers first combat {{operation}} was a raid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> coastal towns of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby. One raid {{had already been}} conducted by the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group, on the town of Yarmouth in late 1914. Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, {{the commander of the}} High Seas Fleet, decided to conduct another raid <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> coast. His goal was to lure a portion of the Grand Fleet into combat where it could be isolated and destroyed. At 03:20 on 15 December, Rear Admiral Franz von Hipper, with his flag in , departed the Jade estuary. Following Seydlitz were Derfflinger, , , and , along with the light cruisers Kolberg, Strassburg, Stralsund, and Graudenz, and two squadrons of torpedo boats. The ships sailed north past the island of Heligoland, until they reached the Horns Reef lighthouse, at which point the ships turned west towards Scarborough. Twelve hours after Hipper left the Jade, the High Seas Fleet departed to provide distant cover. The main fleet consisted of 14 dreadnoughts, eight pre-dreadnoughts and a screening force of two armored cruisers, seven light cruisers, and 54 torpedo boats.|$|E

5|$|It was now common {{knowledge}} that Edward was dying, and foreign diplomats suspected that some scheme to debar Mary was under way.

5|$|Knox's {{death was}} barely noticed at the time. Although his funeral was {{attended}} by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat mentioned his death in their letters that survive.

He was a ruthless and successful revolutionary {{and it was this}} revolutionary philosophy that had a great impact <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>English</b> Puritans. Despite his strictness and dogmatism, he has also been described by partisans as contributing to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in order to bring about moral and spiritual change.|$|E

5|$|Some {{versions}} of the original Soulcalibur arcade game censored Ivy's default costume by covering her bare skin with a lavender catsuit.
