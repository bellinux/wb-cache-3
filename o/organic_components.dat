5|$|Cannel coal (also called candle coal) {{is a type}} of {{terrestrial}} shale, which is hydrogen-rich brown to black coal, sometimes with shaly texture, composed of resins, spores, waxes, cutinaceous and corky materials derived from terrestrial vascular plants as well as varied amounts of vitrinite and inertinite. Lacustrine shales consist of Lamosite and Torbanite. Lamosite is a pale-brown and grayish-brown to dark-gray to black oil shale whose chief organic constituent is lamalginite derived from lacustrine planktonic algae. Torbanite, named after Torbane Hill in Scotland, is a black oil shale whose organic matter is telalginite derived from lipid-rich Botryococcus and related algal forms. Marine shales consist of three varieties, namely Kukersite, Tasmanite, and Marinite. Kukersite, named after Kukruse in Estonia, is a light-brown marine oil shale whose principal organic component is telalginite derived from the green alga, Gloeocapsomorpha prisca. Tasmanite, named after Tasmania, is a brown to black oil shale whose organic matter consists of telalginite derived chiefly from unicellular tasmanitid algae of marine origin. Marinite is a gray to dark-gray to black oil shale of marine origin in which the chief <b>organic</b> <b>components</b> are lamalginite and bituminite derived from marine phytoplankton with varied admixtures of bitumen, telalginite, and vitrinite.|$|E
50|$|The organic part of mineralized tissues {{is made of}} proteins. In bone for example, {{the organic}} layer is the protein collagen.

25|$|Prior to the {{migration}} of the Zabbaleen, the Wahiya had used the refuse, after drying it, {{as a source of}} energy, specifically as fuel for public baths and bean cookeries. However, this use of dried refuse became obsolete in the 1930s when fuel oil became the preferred fuel for public baths and bean cookeries. This coincided with {{the migration}} of the Zabbaleen, who used the <b>organic</b> <b>components</b> of the wastes to feed their pigs. Thus, the Wahiya began to sell the organic refuse to the Zabbaleen.

25|$|In the 1930s and 40s, {{there was}} a second wave of migration. This new group, mostly landless peasants, is known as the Zabbaleen. The {{descendants}} of subsistence farmers, the Zabbaleen originate from the El Badari district in Asyut, a rural region in Upper Egypt, which is the southern part of Egypt. As farming ceased to be a viable way of life, the Zabbaleen faced economic hardships which prompted them to migrate to Cairo in search of work. Henceforth, the Wahiya collaborated with the Zabbaleen, who purchased waste from the Wahiya for use as fodder for pig farming. Initially, the Zabbaleen settled in the Imbaba district of the Giza governorate, but were given a four-day eviction notice from the governor of Giza in 1970. Thereafter, the Zabbaleen settled mainly in an abandoned quarry {{at the foot of the}} Mokattam hills, east of Cairo, which is under the jurisdiction of the Cairo Governorate. Although the governor of Cairo granted the Zabbaleen administrative permission to settle in the area, he did not issue a lease or legal tenure. Thus, because of their precarious situation, the Zabbaleen initially lived in makeshift settlements of tin huts, made mostly of barrels that the Zabbaleen found amongst the waste that they collected. This Zabbaleen community later emerged as the informal garbage collectors and recyclers of Cairo. The literal meaning of the word Zabbaleen is garbage-men (singular: Zabbal). The Zabbaleen are also known as Zarraba (singular: Zarrab), which means pig pen operators, because they raise pigs that eat the <b>organic</b> <b>components</b> of the waste that they collect.|$|E

30|$|It {{is obvious}} from the DSC, DMTA and DRS studies that the general {{properties}} {{as well as the}} structure of OIS depend on the reactivity of the <b>organic</b> <b>component</b> that was regulated by the variation of the ratio between MDI and PIC in the <b>organic</b> <b>component</b> in the reactive mixture during polymerization, dimensions of dominant hybrid network and mineral phase. The rise of the reactivity R of the <b>organic</b> <b>component</b> of OIS by increasing the content of the isocyanate-containing modifier PIC leads to the formation of more rigid, thermostable, less conductive and polarisable OIS. The essential changes of these characteristics occurred in the middle range of the reactivity R of the <b>organic</b> <b>component,</b> while for low and high values of reactivity R, they were more or less invariable. In OIS with low values of reactivity R, the major part of the <b>organic</b> <b>component</b> was macrodiisocyanate; thus, the hybrid organic-inorganic network MDI/SS was the dominant structure, and the general properties of OIS were prevalently defined by the properties of this hybrid network. Hybrid network PIC/SS was in the form of domains in matrix of hybrid network MDI/SS. Otherwise, the hybrid network PIC/SS dominated in OIS with high values of reactivity R, and the general properties of OIS were prevalently defined by the properties of this network. Also, as it was shown in[13], the OIS with low values of R and, correspondingly, the dominant hybrid network MDI/SS contain nano-scale inclusions of the SS mineral phase, whereas the OIS with high values of R and, correspondingly, the dominant hybrid network PIC/SS contain micro-dimensional inclusions of the SS mineral phase. The nano-scale inclusions of the SS mineral phase in OIS with the dominant lowly cross-linked network MDI/SS have much highly developed specific active surface with higher number of charge carriers as compared to the micro-dimensional inclusions of the SS mineral phase in the OIS with the dominant highly cross-linked network PIC/SS. Such distributive behavior of charge carriers leads to a higher charge transfer and, correspondingly, ionic conductivity in OIS with dominant ionomeric lowly cross-linked network MDI/SS as compared to highly cross-linked network PIC/SS. In OIS with middle values of reactivity R, both networks may be dominant, depending on the prevailing product in the <b>organic</b> <b>component.</b> The transition from domination of hybrid network MDI/SS to domination of hybrid network PIC/SS can be pointed near 0.18 of reactivity R of the <b>organic</b> <b>component.</b> In accordance to[20], such OIS can be referred to hybrids with covalently connected building blocks and, in some cases, interpenetrating networks. Thus, for understanding the relationships between structure and properties of such hybrid systems, it is evidently necessary to consider both hybrid networks separately.|$|R

40|$|Estimating {{the amount}} and {{duration}} of heat that bones {{have been exposed to}} is a difficult task, but can be an important question for both forensic and archaeological casework. Temperature related changes can be estimated by histology. For this method most researchers focus on the changes to the inorganic component of bone, because the <b>organic</b> <b>component</b> is often not as well preserved. However, it has proved difficult to estimate lower temperatures based on the inorganic component of bone. Therefore, the <b>organic</b> <b>component</b> of bone should be analysed to determine if it is possible to estimate temperatures below 400 °C. 	To answer the question if histological analysis of the <b>organic</b> <b>component</b> of bone can be used to estimates temperatures below 400 °C, two hundred transverse sections of six dissection room cadavers, composed of both the radius and ulna, where heated to temperatures ranging from 100 °C to 400 °C at three different time intervals; ten, twenty, and thirty minutes. The transverse bone sections where then processed into histological slides for microscopic analysis. 	The results showed that both time and temperature are significant dependents for the alterations that bone undergoes when it is exposed to thermal stress. Interestingly, time seems to play a bigger role, than temperature, in alterations in the <b>organic</b> <b>component</b> by heat. By using histology to examine the <b>organic</b> <b>component</b> of bone it is possible to differentiate between temperatures ranging between 200 °C and 400 °C but it was difficult to distinguish between 200 °C and 250 °C after twenty minutes. The most discriminative feature is the birefringence of the collagen structures, which is greatly reduced when time is extended. 	By combing the histological view and the birefringence of the collagen structures {{it might be possible to}} estimate temperature and time in the range of 200 °C to 400 °C. Most important, by using this method it may be possible to exclude samples that, based on colour, have been suggested to be exposed to heat.
