Storm and Moore {{teamed up to}} defeat Kim and Petey Williams at both Against All Odds and Destination X. Moore, however, was defeated by Kim at Lockdown in TNA's first women's steel cage match. Later, during a Street Fight with Kim on Impact!, Moore's two front teeth were knocked <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Throughout early and mid-2008, she continued to participate in women's matches, but failed to obtain the TNA Knockouts Championship. She then managed Beer Money, Inc. (Storm and Robert Roode), before being removed from television {{to work as a}} backstage agent. On June 19, 2009 she {{returned to}} in-ring action, defeating Rhaka Khan at a house show in Grand Rapids, Michigan. On July 12, 2009, however TNA parted ways with Moore.|$|E

500|$|Kaali {{is portrayed}} mostly in two forms: the popular four-armed {{form and the}} ten-armed Mahakaali form.

[...] Her eyes are described as red with intoxication, and in absolute rage, her hair is shown disheveled, small fangs sometimes protrude <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth,</b> and her tongue is lolling. She is often just wearing a skirt made of human arms and a garland of human heads. She is also accompanied by serpents and a jackal while standing on the calm and prostrate Shiva, usually right foot forward to symbolize the more popular Dakshinamarga or right-handed path, {{as opposed to the}} more infamous and transgressive Vamamarga or left-handed path.|$|E

The girl attempts to speak, but no words come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth.</b> Angie notices police in a nearby parking lot and rushes outside to get help. He realizes a crowd has gathered around the dead body of the same girl he saw only moments earlier in the bowling alley. Angie relates his bizarre tale to Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson).

The agents discover the words, [...] "She is me" [...] written on the bowling lane where Angie saw the spirit, but its meaning remains a mystery.|$|E

500|$|The autobiographical {{story begins}} as a brunette Gaga is taken through a clinic on a stretcher, while an inner {{monologue}} about her past memories is heard. The nurses wear Calvin Klein Collection uniforms and Giuseppe Zanotti shoes. A nurse awakens Gaga and checks her heart rate and blood pressure. The nurse then tells Gaga how beautiful she is and how she looked just like her mother when she delivered the former. Gaga then claims {{that her mother was}} a saint, before taking a cigarette out of her bag. The nurse, startled by this, quickly then takes the cigarette <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> and puts it on a table. Gaga cries and tells the nurse that she will become a star. She asks the nurse to play music and the camera zooms out to show viewers several female patients treated and wandering off. A new scene shows Gaga practicing ballet dancing to piano music, and a following one shows her taken back from the hospital to her New York apartment by her best friend Bo. Ludwig van Beethoven's [...] "Piano Sonata No. 8" [...] plays. Gaga is undressed from an outfit designed by Stéphane Rolland and taken to bed, but is interrupted by a phone call that notifies her of being dropped from her record label. Frustrated, she makes a mess in her apartment, pours breakfast cereal on herself, and jumps in the bath with her heels on. The piano music ends and Gaga is seen bleaching her hair, bathing in a tub, and humming [...] "Marry the Night". The monologue continues as Gaga says, [...] "But I still had my bedazzler and I had a lot of patches, shiny ones from M Trimmings, so I wreaked havoc on some old denim. And I did what any girl would do—I did it all over again." [...] According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV News, Gaga resembles pop artist Madonna in the film Desperately Seeking Susan. Gaga's dancers look down at her from a mezzanine as the clock chimes.|$|E
500|$|Bell {{said that}} at first Anna was written plainer and more general. [...] "In {{the first draft of}} the script she was written more, in my opinion, prissy. She was kind of {{specific}} and very girly," [...] which Bell didn't find appealing. She admitted that she had always {{wanted to be part of}} Disney animated feature, but she [...] "wanted to be a very specific type of princess", who [...] "was way more awkward than the normal princesses", not someone with too good postures or too well-spoken. As she was offered the role of Anna, she came up with a lot of suggestions for the directors. They were responsive and allowed the actress to mould the character the way she wanted, since they wanted the film to be truthful. Bell significantly made specific changes to Anna, including the infusion and incorporation of the actress' own personality to the character, [...] embodying a relatable heroine, which received full support from the directors. She called the scene where Anna first meets Hans is a [...] "typical Disney moment", as they come too close physically and find out that they both fall in love with each other. Bell wanted Anna's words to reflect what she herself would say in real life, which included some [...] "nonsensical rambling". [...] "I think I said, [...] "This is awkward. You're not awkward. Me, I'm awkward. You're gorgeous. Wait—what?" [...] Words just spill <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> too quickly and she has to backtrack." [...] Bell continued. Or the whole scene where she wakes up in the beginning with saliva all over the face, Bell [...] "wanted her to also have hair in her mouth", which took inspiration from her own real life. [...] "Sometimes I wake up like that. Then you have hair in your mouth, and you start coughing. The animators totally got what I was trying to do. It's cool, and way more fun when stuff is realistic like that, instead of the perfection of waking up with mascara on." [...] Anna's snorting and tripping over also drew inspirations from Bell's real life. Bell's recording sessions were also videotaped to assist in animating the character, and animators took into considerations even subtle things like the actress' biting her lip a lot. According to director Jennifer Lee, Anna is a bit flawed.|$|E
2500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Jesse Davey, depicts the band playing {{in front of}} a young woman, the [...] "Hollywood Whore" [...] that the song is referring to. Eventually, the woman arises and blood is seen falling from her eyes.

50|$|House and {{the team}} take {{on the case of}} a woman called Dana Miller who {{collapsed}} {{in the middle of a}} cooking class. When they learn that Dana gave up her career as a highly renowned cancer researcher in order to pursue her own personal happiness, the members of the team question their own happiness (or lack thereof). Dana's belly fills with blood, which turns out to be from her liver. She also develops an itch on her temple. She scratches it even in her sleep. She's scratched through her skull and brain matter starts to ooze <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. She also starts experiencing spinal shocks. A scan reveals masses in her lungs, spine and pericardium. Later, her heart also stops and she bleeds into her pericardium. They relieve the blood from her heart, but she bleeds <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> nose, <b>mouth,</b> ears and eyes. While talking to Cuddy, House realizes Dana is menstruating as well as bleeding out, indicating that it's not a coincidence. He proposes that during the surgery for her myoma, endometrial cells were dispersed into the bloodstream. These cells attached to various organs, multiplied, and after reaching a critical mass, began bleeding during her menstruation. The team successfully treats Dana's endometriosis by cutting out the small masses of endometrium.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good, that," [...] {{he said to}} himself, {{while her}} eyes rested upon him, black and impenetrable like the mental caverns where revolutionary thought should sit {{plotting}} the violent way of its dream of changes. As if anything could be changed! In this world of men nothing can be changed--neither happiness nor misery. They can only be displaced {{at the cost of}} corrupted consciences and broken lives--a futile game for arrogant philosophers and sanguinary triflers. Those thoughts darted through Razumov's head while he stood facing the old revolutionary hand, the respected, trusted, and influential Sophia Antonovna, whose word had such a weight in the [...] "active" [...] section of every party. She was much more representative than the great Peter Ivanovitch. Stripped of rhetoric, mysticism, and theories, she was the true spirit of destructive revolution. And she was the personal adversary he had to meet. It gave him a feeling of triumphant pleasure to deceive <b>her</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>mouth.</b> The epigrammatic saying that speech has been given to us for the purpose of concealing our thoughts came into his mind. Of that cynical theory this was a very subtle and a very scornful application, flouting in its own words the very spirit of ruthless revolution, embodied in that woman with her white hair and black eyebrows, like slightly sinuous lines of Indian ink, drawn together by the perpendicular folds of a thoughtful frown.|$|R
2500|$|In April 2005, Floyd {{caused a}} stir with {{comments}} she made to the LA Times about then-Court TV colleague Nancy Grace.

2500|$|Searching {{elsewhere}} for a bride, Charles looked to France instead. The English agent Kensington {{was sent to}} Paris in 1624 to examine the potential French match, and the marriage was finally negotiated in Paris by James Hay and Henry Rich. Henrietta Maria was aged just fifteen {{at the time of}} her marriage, but this was not unusually young for royal princesses of the period. Views on Henrietta Maria's appearance vary; her husband's niece, Sophia of Hanover commented that the... "beautiful portraits of Van Dyck had given me such a fine idea of all the ladies of England that I was surprised to see that the queen, who I had seen as so beautiful and lean, was a woman well past her prime. Her arms were long and lean, her shoulders uneven, and some of her teeth were coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> like tusks.... She did, however, have pretty eyes, nose, and a good complexion...." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his article}} [...] "Too Gay for the U.S.A.", Andrew Webster of The Escapist used {{the history of}} Birdo in the lead-in to his article, commenting on how Nintendo tried to hide Birdo's gender confusion, and how [...] "He's {{just one of a}} long line of Japanese {{videogame}} characters forced to hide their true sexual identity". GamesRadar UK listed Birdo as one of [...] "gaming's most repelling anti-babes", describing her as a [...] "pink, egg blowing, transvestite dinosaur with a mouth like a burst fire hose," [...] thereby describing her as [...] "terrifying". Morgan Webb of X-Play created a video titled [...] "Birdo WTF", commenting that everyone initially thought of Birdo as a [...] "cute little dinosaur". She also describes her as a very feminine male character if she really is transgender. Nintendo Power listed Birdo as one of three weirdos, citing her change from being male to being a love interest for Yoshi. They described her gender as one of life's biggest questions, commenting on how she shoots eggs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mouth</b> as another oddity. IGN's Lucas M. Thomas commented that Birdo is [...] "the most gender-confused character in the history of Nintendo". He also commented on the relationship Yoshi and Birdo formed in Mario Tennis, stating, [...] "They were both sexually chaotic as individuals" [...] as [...] "Yoshi is supposedly a male, but lays eggs like a female. Birdo is supposedly a female, but was originally called a male." ...|$|E
