5|$|The Wehrmacht {{launched}} its {{attack on the}} morning of 5 July 1943 and met heavy resistance. There were far more Soviet anti-tank guns, minefields, anti-tank ditches and overall Soviet resistance than had been anticipated, making a breakthrough more difficult to achieve. Furthermore, from the outset they were subjected to frequent counterattacks from Soviet tank units. Despite this, by the end of 5 July the II SS-Panzer Corps had advanced through the first defensive belt on the southern side of the salient and reached the second, although the plan was to breach the first two belts and reach the third on the first day. Nonetheless, the panzer corps' penetration caused great concern among Soviet commanders, compelling Vatutin to commit almost all of Voronezh Front's <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> {{by the end of the}} first day.|$|E
25|$|Enver was the {{strategist}} of the operation. Hassan Izzet was the tactician who {{implemented the}} plan and remedied the shortcomings. The failure was blamed on Enver. Beyond his faulty estimate on how the enveloped Russians would react, his failure was on not keeping adequate <b>operational</b> <b>reserves.</b> He {{did not have enough}} field services to alleviate the hardships faced by the soldiers; he analyzed operational necessities theoretically rather than contextually.|$|E
25|$|The Soviet {{victory in}} the Korsun-Shevchenkovsky Offensive marked the {{successful}} implementation of Soviet deep operations. Soviet Deep Battle doctrine envisaged {{the breaking of the}} enemy's forward defences to allow fresh <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> to exploit the breakthrough by driving into the strategic depth of the enemy front. The arrival of large numbers of U.S. and British built trucks and halftracks gave the Soviet forces much greater mobility than they had in the earlier portion of the war. This, coupled with the Soviet capacity to hold large formations in reserve gave the Red Army the ability to drive deep behind German defenses again and again.|$|E

500|$|The {{topography}} of the Vimy battlefield made defence-in-depth difficult to realize. The ridge was [...] wide at its narrowest point, with a steep drop {{on the eastern}} side, all but eliminating the possibility of counterattacks if the ridge was captured. The Germans were apprehensive about the inherent weakness of the Vimy Ridge defences. The German defensive scheme was to maintain a front line defence of sufficient strength to defend against an initial assault and move <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> forward, before the enemy could consolidate their gains or overrun remaining German positions. As a result, the German defence at Vimy Ridge relied largely on machine guns, which acted as force multipliers for the defending infantry.|$|E
500|$|The {{campaign}} was a strategic Soviet success. For the first time, a major German offensive had been stopped before achieving a breakthrough. The Germans, despite using more technologically advanced armour {{than in previous}} years, were unable {{to break through the}} in-depth Soviet defences and were caught off guard by the significant <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> of the Red Army. This result changed the pattern of operations on the Eastern Front, with the Soviet Union gaining the operational initiative. The Soviet victory, however, was costly, with the Red Army losing considerably more men and materiel than the German Army. However, the Soviet Union's larger industrial potential and pool of manpower allowed them to absorb and replenish these losses, with their overall strategic strength unaffected.

500|$|His {{approach}} was disliked. Model {{had a reputation}} of a ruthless commander, willing to inflict and take casualties to stabilize his front. The splitting up of units was continually practiced by Model and {{took place on the}} regimental and divisional level. The objective was always to give necessary reinforcements to the centres of gravity when no reserves were available. From an operational viewpoint this allowed Model to achieve defensive successes, which {{would not have been possible}} otherwise. According to Newton the [...] sending of theatre or <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> into the line where the fighting was toughest was meant to preserve the units Model saw as organically tied to his own command. For example, he was given the elite Großdeutschland Division in September 1942, when his Ninth Army was under heavy attack during Operation Mars. Though he was told that the division was not to be broken up, Model nonetheless split it into battalions and companies, which he used to plug any gaps that appeared. Großdeutschland took nearly 10,000 casualties out of a strength of 18,000 men, and at one point was reportedly close to mutiny; but from Model's viewpoint these losses were acceptable because they meant that Ninth Army's own troops did not have to suffer them. According to Newton, Model reasoned that the elite units would be eventually withdrawn and reformed, an option which may not have been available to his regular army divisions. That said, he did not simply treat these reserve units as disposable. In early 1942, the Der Führer Regiment of the 2nd SS Division Das Reich was reduced to a handful of men in three weeks of bitter fighting—but in that time it also received reinforcements including [...] 88 mm guns, artillery pieces, and StuG III assault guns, and Model himself visited the sector daily, calculating the minimum support that would be needed to hold off the Soviet attacks.|$|E

50|$|The first echelon used raw {{firepower}} {{and mass}} {{to break the}} layered enemy defences, but the second echelon <b>operational</b> <b>reserves</b> combined firepower and mobility, something lacking in the former. Operational units were heavily formed from mechanized, motorised and Cavalry forces. These forces would now seek to envelope the enemy tactical forces as yet unengaged along the flanks of the breakthrough point.

While in the operational rear of the enemy, communications and supply depots were prime targets for the Soviet forces.

5000|$|On November 3, Iraqi forces reached Abadan in Iran's Khuzestan province. Iranian {{resistance}} {{proved too}} strong, however, so Iraqi commanders called for reinforcements.
