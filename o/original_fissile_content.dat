40|$|A lead {{slowing-down}} spectrometer (LSDS) {{system is}} under development to analyze isotopic <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> that is applicable to spent fuel and recycled material. The source neutron mechanism for {{efficient and effective}} generation was also determined. The source neutron interacts with a lead medium and produces continuous neutron energy, and this energy generates dominant fission at each fissile, below the unresolved resonance region. From {{the relationship between the}} induced fissile fission and the fast fission neutron detection, a mathematical assay model for an isotopic fissile material was set up. The assay model can be expanded for all fissile materials. The correction factor for self-shielding was defined in the fuel assay area. The corrected fission signature provides well-defined fission properties with an increase in the <b>fissile</b> <b>content.</b> The assay procedure was also established. The assay energy range is very important {{to take into account the}} prominent fission structure of each fissile material. Fission detection occurred according to the change of the Pu 239 weight percent (wt%), but the content of U 235 and Pu 241 was fixed at 1 wt%. The assay result was obtained with 2 ∼ 3 % uncertainty for Pu 239, depending on the amount of Pu 239 in the fuel. The results show that LSDS is a very powerful technique to assay the isotopic <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> in spent fuel and recycled materials for the reuse of fissile materials.

40|$|A {{quantitative}} assay of isotopic {{fissile materials}} (U 235, Pu 239, Pu 241) {{was done at}} Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), using lead slowing down spectrometer (LSDS). The optimum design of LSDS was performed based on economics, easy maintenance and assay effectiveness. LSDS system consists of spectrometer, neutron source, detection and control. LSDS system induces fissile fission and fast neutrons are collected at fission chamber. The detected signal has a direct relation to the mass of existing fissile isotopes. Many current commercial assay technologies have a limitation in direct application on isotopic fissile assay of spent fuel, except chemical analysis. In the designed system, the fissile assay model was setup and the correction factor for self-shield was obtained. The isotopic <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> assay was performed by changing the content of Pu 239. Based on the fuel rod, the isotopic content was consistent with ~ 2 % uncertainty for Pu 239. By applying the covering (neutron absorber), the effective shielding was obtained and the activation was calculated on the target. From the assay evaluation, LSDS technique is very powerful and direct to analyze the isotopic <b>fissile</b> <b>content.</b> LSDS is applicable for nuclear fuel cycle and spent fuel management for safety and economics.

40|$|A future {{nuclear energy}} system is being {{developed}} at Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI), the system involves a Sodium Fast Reactor (SFR) linked with the pyro-process. The pyro-process produces a source material to fabricate a SFR fuel rod. Therefore, an isotopic <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> assay {{is very important for}} fuel rod safety and SFR economics. A new technology for an analysis of isotopic <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> has been proposed using a lead slowing down spectrometer (LSDS). The new technology has several features for a fissile analysis from spent fuel: direct isotopic fissile assay, no background interference, and no requirement from burnup history information. Several calculations were done on the designed spectrometer geometry: detection sensitivity, neutron energy spectrum analysis, neutron fission characteristics, self shielding analysis, and neutron production mechanism. The spectrum was well organized even at low neutron energy and the threshold fission chamber was a proper choice to get prompt fast fission neutrons. The characteristic fission signature was obtained in slowing down neutron energy from each fissile isotope. Another application of LSDS is for an optimum design of the spent fuel storage, maximization of the burnup credit and provision of the burnup code correction factor.

At the same time, the Department of Energy (DOE) has begun encouraging custodians of INF to perform measurements on INF for which no recent <b>fissile</b> <b>contents</b> measurement data exists. INF, in the form of spent fuel from Experimental Breeder Reactor 2 (EBR-II), has been stored in close-fitting, dry underground storage locations at the Radioactive Scrap and Waste Facility (RSWF) at Argonne National Laboratory-West (ANL-W) for many years.

Also, the ratio of <b>fissile</b> <b>contents</b> in each pipe: HEU/LEU, HEU/PEU, and PEU/LEU, are obtained.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} determining the effective neutron multiplication factor and the breeding ratio for the KLT- 40 S at operating conditions. The main reactor design features are presented which are necessary for calculations. It is shown {{that the type of}} fertile nuclides has no virtual effect on the formation of the neutron flux density spectrum. The contribution of each neutron group to the fission reaction rate at the design <b>fissile</b> nuclide <b>content</b> of 18. 6 % is determined. The dependences of average values of macroscopic fission cross-sections, absorption of fissile nuclides and radiation capture of fertile nuclides on the <b>fissile</b> nuclide <b>content</b> in nuclear fuel are obtained. Averaging of cross-sections was carried out over neutron flux density spectra. As a result, dependences were obtained of the effective neutron multiplication factor and breeding ratio on the <b>fissile</b> isotope <b>content</b> for various fuel compositions of uranium and thorium cycles at the KLT- 40 S campaign start-up. In terms of the effective multiplication factor, the best result is obtained in the 232 Th+ 233 U composition when the <b>fissile</b> isotope <b>content</b> is more than 5 %, and in the 238 U+ 239 Pu composition when the the <b>fissile</b> isotope <b>content</b> is less than 5 %. In terms of the breeding ratio, the best result is obtained in the 232 Th+ 235 U composition when the <b>fissile</b> isotope <b>content</b> is up to 10 %; if it exceeds 10 %, its values are relatively the same for the 232 Th+ 233 U and 232 Th+ 235 U and 238 U+ 235 U compositions. Thus, the most efficient composition at the nuclear fuel campaign start-up is 232 Th+ 233 U with the 233 U nuclide content more than 5 % due to very high values of the effective neutron multiplication factor...|$|R
40|$|The International Atomic Energy Agency?s (IAEA) {{safeguards}} technical {{objective is}} the timely detection of a diversion {{of a significant}} quantity of nuclear material from peaceful activities to the manufacture of nuclear weapons or of other nuclear explosive devices or for purposes unknown, and deterrence of such diversion by the risk of early detection. An important IAEA task towards meeting this objective {{is the ability to}} accurately and reliably measure spent nuclear fuel (SNF) to verify reactor operating parameters and verify that the fuel has not been removed from reactors or SNF storage facilities. This dissertation analyzes a method to improve the state-of-the-art of nuclear material safeguards measurements using two combined measurement techniques: passive neutron albedo reactivity (PNAR) and passive spectral photon measurements. PNAR was used for measurements of SNF in Japan as well as fresh fuel pins at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The measured PNAR signal was shown to trend well with neutron multiplication and <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> of the SNF. The PNAR measurements showed a 73 % change in signal for a fuel burnup range of 7. 1 to 19. 2 GWd/MTHM of spent mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel and a 40 % change in signal over a range of initial ^ 235 U enrichment from 0. 2 % to 3. 2 % in UO 2 fuel. Photon measurements were performed {{on a wide range of}} SNF pins to determine which photon signatures are visible in different sets of fuels. These signatures were then investigated and tested using a sensitivity analysis to determine the spent fuel parameters to which each signal is most sensitive. These photon signatures can be used to determine SNF parameters that can support PNAR determination of SNF <b>fissile</b> <b>content.</b> Based on the results from these measurements, we have concluded that spectral photon measurements can determine operating parameters to improve the implementation of PNAR. We also concluded that PNAR can accurately measure multiplication and <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> in SNF with standard deviations of 1 % and 4 %, respectively. The PNAR and photon measurements can be used together as a powerful tool to support the IAEA safeguards technical objective...|$|R

This paper addresses {{the application of the}} {sup 252 }Cf-source-driven frequency analysis measurements for verification of the <b>fissile</b> material <b>content</b> of sealed spent fuel canisters. The cross-power spectral density (CPSD) between the {sup 252 }Cf source in an ionization chamber and external neutron detectors depends only on the induced fission rate in the fissile system and is independent of inherent sources.

40|$|A lead {{slowing down}} {{spectrometer}} (LSDS) is under development {{for analysis of}} isotopic <b>fissile</b> material <b>contents</b> in pyro-processed material, or spent fuel. Many current commercial fissile assay technologies have a limitation in accurate and direct assay of <b>fissile</b> <b>content.</b> However, LSDS is very sensitive in distinguishing fissile fission signals from each isotope. A neutron spectrum analysis was conducted in the spectrometer and the energy resolution was investigated from 0. 1 eV to 100 keV. The spectrum was well shaped in the slowing down energy. The resolution was enough to obtain each fissile from 0. 2 eV to 1 keV. The detector existence in the lead will disturb the source neutron spectrum. It causes a change in resolution and peak amplitude. The intense source neutron production was designed for ∼E 12 n's/sec to overcome spent fuel background. The detection sensitivity of U 238 and Th 232 fission chamber was investigated. The first and second layer detectors increase detection efficiency. Thorium also has a threshold property to detect the fast fission neutrons from fissile fission. However, the detection of Th 232 is about 76 % of that of U 238. A linear detection model was set up over the slowing down neutron energy to obtain each <b>fissile</b> material <b>content.</b> The isotopic <b>fissile</b> assay using LSDS is applicable for the optimum design of spent fuel storage to maximize burnup credit and quality assurance of the recycled nuclear material for safety and economics.

40|$|The {{development}} of non-destructive assay (NDA) capabilities to directly measure the <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> in spent fuel {{is needed to}} improve the timely detection of the diversion of significant quantities of fissile material. Currently, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) does not have effective NDA methods to verify spent fuel and recover continuity of knowledge {{in the event of}} a containment and surveillance systems failure. This issue has become increasingly critical with the worldwide expansion of nuclear power, adoption of enhanced safeguards criteria for spent fuel verification, and recent efforts by the IAEA to incorporate an integrated safeguards regime. In order to address these issues, the use of Self-Interrogation Neutron Resonance Densitometry (SINRD) has been developed to improve existing nuclear safeguards and material accountability measurements. The following characteristics of SINRD were analyzed: (1) ability to measure the <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> in Light Water Reactors (LWR) fuel assemblies and (2) sensitivity and penetrability of SINRD to the removal of fuel pins from an assembly. The Monte Carlo Neutral Particle eXtended (MCNPX) transport code was used to simulate SINRD for different geometries. Experimental measurements were also performed with SINRD and were compared to MCNPX simulations of the experiment to verify the accuracy of the MCNPX model of SINRD. Based on the results from these simulations and measurements, we have concluded that SINRD provides a number of improvements over current IAEA verification methods. These improvements include: 1) SINRD provides absolute measurements of burnup independent of the operator?s declaration. 2) SINRD is sensitive to pin removal over the entire burnup range and can verify the diversion of 6 % of fuel pins within 3 ? from LWR spent LEU and MOX fuel. 3) SINRD is insensitive to the boron concentration and initial fuel enrichment and can therefore be used at multiple spent fuel storage facilities. 4) The calibration of SINRD at one reactor facility carries over to reactor sites in different countries because it uses the ratio of fission chambers (FCs) that are not facility dependent. 5) SINRD can distinguish fresh and 1 -cycle spent MOX fuel from 3 - and 4 -cycles spent LEU fuel without using reactor burnup codes...|$|R
40|$|In {{currently}} operating commercial {{nuclear power}} plants (NPP), {{there are two main}} types of nuclear fuel, low enriched uranium (LEU) fuel, and mixed-oxide uranium-plutonium (MOX) fuel. The LEU fuel is made of pure uranium dioxide (UO{sub 2 } or UOX) and has been the fuel of choice in commercial light water reactors (LWRs) for a number of years. Naturally occurring uranium contains a mixture of different uranium isotopes, primarily, {sup 235 }U and {sup 238 }U. {sup 235 }U is a fissile isotope, and will readily undergo a fission reaction upon interaction with a thermal neutron. {sup 235 }U has an isotopic concentration of 0. 71 % in naturally occurring uranium. For most reactors to maintain a fission chain reaction, the natural isotopic concentration of {sup 235 }U must be increased (enriched) to a level greater than 0. 71 %. Modern nuclear reactor fuel assemblies contain a number of fuel pins potentially having different {sup 235 }U enrichments varying from {approx} 2. 0 % to {approx} 5 % enriched in {sup 235 }U. Currently in the United States (US), all commercial {{nuclear power plants}} use UO{sub 2 } fuel. In the rest of the world, UO{sub 2 } fuel is still commonly used, but MOX fuel is also used in a number of reactors. MOX fuel contains a mixture of both UO{sub 2 } and PuO{sub 2 }. Because the plutonium provides the <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> of the fuel, the uranium used in MOX is either natural or depleted uranium. PuO{sub 2 } is added to effectively replace the <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> of {sup 235 }U so that the level of <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> is sufficiently high to maintain the chain reaction in an LWR. Both reactor-grade and weapons-grade plutonium contains a number of fissile and non-fissile plutonium isotopes, with the fraction of fissile and non-fissile plutonium isotopes being dependent on the source of the plutonium. While only RG plutonium is currently used in MOX, there is the possibility that WG plutonium from dismantled weapons will be used to make MOX for use in US reactors. Reactor-grade plutonium in MOX fuel is generally obtained from reprocessed irradiated nuclear fuel, whereas weapons-grade plutonium is obtained from decommissioned nuclear weapons material and thus has a different plutonium (and other actinides) concentration. Using MOX fuel instead of UOX fuel has potential impacts on the neutronic performance of the nuclear fuel and the design of the nuclear fuel must take these differences into account. Each of the plutonium sources (RG and WG) has different implications on the neutronic behavior of the fuel because each contains a different blend of plutonium nuclides. The amount of heat and the number of neutrons produced from fission of plutonium nuclides is different from fission of {sup 235 }U. These differences in UOX and MOX do not end at discharge of the fuel from the reactor core - the short- and long-term storage of MOX fuel may have different requirements than UOX fuel because of the different discharged fuel decay heat characteristics. The research documented in this report compares MOX and UOX fuel during storage and disposal of the fuel by comparing decay heat rates for typical pressurized water reactor (PWR) and boiling water reactor (BWR) fuel assemblies with and without weapons-grade (WG) and reactor-grade (RG) MOX fuel...|$|R

From a practical point of view, however, it is a challenge to define which data must be retained, for how long it must be kept and by what methods. Spent nuclear fuels contain some nuclides of special importance in data management. While the <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> is the key interest for recovery by reprocessing, the minor actinides are of principal concern in the case of spent fuel disposal because of their long half-life and radiotoxicity. The recent concept of total cycle management in repository performance requires accounting of all the nuclides data, while data on the spent fuel content is required for such a case as direct reuse of spent fuel by re-fabrication without separating particular radionuclides...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the sensitivity of}} antineutrino count rate measurements {{to changes in the}} <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> of civil power reactors. Such measurements may be useful in IAEA reactor safeguards applications. We introduce a hypothesis testing procedure to identify statistically significant differences between the antineutrino count rate evolution of a standard 'baseline' fuel cycle and that of an anomalous cycle, in which plutonium is removed and replaced with an equivalent fissile worth of uranium. The test would allow an inspector to detect anomalous reactor activity, or to positively confirm that the reactor is operating {{in a manner consistent with}} its declared fuel inventory and power level. We show that with a reasonable choice of detector parameters, the test can detect replacement of 73 kg of plutonium in 90 days with 95 % probability, while controlling the false positive rate at 5 %. We show that some improvement on this level of sensitivity may be expected by various means, including use of the method in conjunction with existing reactor safeguards methods. We also identify a necessary and sufficient daily antineutrino count rate to achieve the quoted sensitivity, and list examples of detectors in which such rates have been attained.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to evaluate a potential discrepancy between the Solid Waste Management (SWM) Criticality Prevention Specifications and a proposed waste receipt from Bettis Laboratories. This analysis resolves an apparent discrepancy between two different requirements of the Central Waste Complex and 200 Area Low-Level Burial Grounds Criticality Prevention Specifications (CPS-SW- 149 - 00002 and CPS-SW- 149 - 00003 respectively). The analysis is being performed to enable Solid Waste Management to accept a specific package from Bettis Laboratories. This package meets the requirements of section 2. 1. 1 in that the total <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> of the drum is less than 200 g and the waste occupies greater than 20 % of the container volume. The package may not appear, however, {{to meet the requirements}} of section 2. 1. 5 for maximum enrichment of uranium bearing waste, as will be described below. Based on this analysis for this specific package, the waste is shown to be critically safe under all conditions for which the 55 -gallon drums (17 C, 17 H, or UN 1 A 2) specification applies. This package can be accepted under the 55 -gallon drum limitations on fissile quantity. No change to the CPS is required...|$|R
40|$|Plutonium {{recycling}} in Light Water Reactors {{is today}} an industrial reality. It is recycled {{in the form}} of (U,Pu) O- 2 fuel pellets (MOX), fabricated to a large extent according to UO 2 technology and pellet design. The similarity of physical, chemical, and neutron properties of both fuels also allows MOX fuel to be burnt in nuclear plants originally designed to burn UO 2,The industrial processes presently in use or planned are all based on a mechanical blending of UO 2 and PuO 2 powders. To obtain finely dispersed plutonium and to prevent high local concentration of plutonium, the feed materials are micronised. In the BNFL process, the whole (UO 2 PuO 2) blend is micronised by attrition milling. According to the MIMAS process, developed by BELGONUCLEAIRE, a primary blend made of UO 2 containing about 30 % PuO 2 is micronised in a ball mill, afterwards this primary blend is mechanically diluted in UO 2 to obtain the specified Pu content. After mixing, the (U,Pu) 02 powder is pressed and the pellets are sintered. The sintering cover gas contains moisture and 5 v/o H- 2. Moisture increases the sintering process and the U-Pu interdiffusion. After sintering and grinding, the pellets are submitted to severe controls to verify conformity with customer specifications (<b>fissile</b> <b>content,</b> Pu distribution, surface condition, chemical purity, density, microstructure) ...|$|R
40|$|In a lead-cooled {{fast reactor}} (LFR), small bubbles (in {{the order of}} one mm or less) may enter the coolant from a leaking steam generator.  If such a leakage is undetected the small bubbles may {{eventually}} coalesce into a larger bubble in local stagnation zones under the active core. If such a bubble or void releases and passes through the core, it could drive the reactor into prompt criticality. It is therefore desirable {{to be able to}} detect the initial stages of such void formation. In this thesis, a methodology to detect such leaks is presented together with a study on void-induced reactivity effects in various LFR's. The methodology developed is based on information from two fission chambers positioned radially outside the core.  The <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> of the fission chambers consist either of 235 U or  242 Pu making them sensitive to different parts of the neutron spectrum. It is shown that the information from the fission chambers can be used to obtain an early indication of the presence of a small leak within typically a month. Furthermore, it is shown that for all but the smallest LFR’s, prompt criticality due to voids passing the core cannot be excluded. One conclusion is that the methodology may form an attractive complement to the general monitoring system of future LFR’s but, as is noted, it has potential for further developments...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of life cycle management of radioactive materials packaging {{is to ensure}} the safety functions (i. e., containment of radioactivity, protection against radiation, and criticality safety for <b>fissile</b> <b>contents)</b> during the entire life cycle of the packaging in storage, transportation, and disposal. A framework has been developed for life cycle management regarding Type B radioactive and fissile materials packaging, drawing upon current U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) storage standards and examples from interim storage of Pu-bearing materials in Model 9975 transportation packagings. Key issues highlighted during long-term storage of Pu-bearing materials included gas generation and stability of PuO 2 +x; other operation safety issues highlighted for interim storage of Model 9975 transportation packagings included the need to consider a facility design-basis fire event and the long-term behavior of packaging components such as Celotex and elastomeric O-ring seals. The principles of aging management are described, and the key attributes and examples of effective aging management programs are provided based on the guidance documents for license renewal of nuclear power plants. The Packaging Certification Program of DOE Environmental Management, Office of Safety Management and Operations, plans to expand its mission into packaging certification for storage and aging management, as well as application of advanced technology, such as radiofrequency identification, for life cycle management of radioactive materials packagings...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} thermally treatable, radioactive mixed waste inventory {{is characterized}} to support {{implementation of the}} commercial, 1214 thermal treatment contract. The existing thermally treatable waste inventory has been identified using a decision matrix developed by Josephson et al. (1996). Similar to earlier waste characterization reports (Place 1993 and 1994), hazardous materials, radionuclides, physical properties, and waste container data are statistically analyzed. In addition, the waste inventory data is analyzed to correlate waste constituent data {{that are important to}} the implementation of the commercial thermal treatment contract for obtaining permits and for process design. The specific waste parameters, which were analyzed, include the following: ``dose equivalent`` curie content, polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) content, identification of containers with PA-related mobile radionuclides (14 C, 12 79 Se, 99 Tc, and U isotopes), tritium content, debris and non-debris content, container free liquid <b>content,</b> <b>fissile</b> isotope <b>content,</b> identification of dangerous waste codes, asbestos containers, high mercury containers, beryllium dust containers, lead containers, overall waste quantities, analysis of container types, and an estimate of the waste compositional split based on the thermal treatment contractor`s proposed process.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} a homogeneous thorium-plutonium fuel cycle developed for the Integral Inherently Safe LWR (I$^ 2 $S-LWR). The I$^ 2 $S-LWR is an advanced 2850 MWt integral PWR with inherent safety features. Its baseline fuel and cladding materials are U$_ 3 $Si$_ 2 $ and advanced FeCrAl steel, respectively. The advanced steel cladding can withstand longer exposure periods with significantly lower degradation rates compared to traditional Zr-based alloys. However, longer fuel cycles would require higher fuel enrichment, and this is currently limited to 5 $^w$% in the I$^ 2 $S-LWR. Therefore, an alternative thorium-plutonium mixed oxide (TOX) fuel cycle is investigated. In principle, the TOX fuel cycle has no <b>fissile</b> <b>content</b> limitation and becomes even more attractive for long irradiation periods, due to the efficient build-up of $^{ 233 }$U, which increases its cumulative energy share and hence decreases the initial Pu requirements per unit of energy produced by the fuel. Current Pu recycling practice {{in the form of}} U–Pu mixed oxide (MOX) fuel is not well-suited for Pu disposition due to continuous Pu production from $^{ 238 }$U. This study compares the TOX and MOX cores in terms of efficiency of Pu disposition. The results show that the burnt Pu fraction in the TOX cycle is much higher, and could be further enhanced for longer irradiations (100 MWd/kg or more).
