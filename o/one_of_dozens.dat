500|$|Belgian {{resistance}} {{to the treatment of}} Jews crystallised between August–September 1942, following the passing of legislation regarding wearing yellow badges and the start of the deportations. When deportations began, Jewish partisans destroyed records of Jews compiled by the AJB.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Ponce {{continued}} to be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>dozens</b> of hamlets that dotted the Island.

The effect of this mass migration was not felt significantly until the 1820s.

2500|$|On 25 November, {{shares on}} Egypt's stock market plunged almost 10%. Trading was {{suspended}} for 30 minutes as shares slumped in the first session since the president's 22 November constitutional declaration.

Judges {{in two of the}} country's 27 provinces, including Alexandria, heeded the call to strike while those elsewhere in the country were meeting to decide their response. After a meeting with Egypt's justice minister Ahmed Mekki urged judges not to disrupt their work by joining in a proposed strike over the decree. But the council also urged the president to scale back his writ, to limit the immunity from judicial review he decreed for [...] "laws and decisions issued by the president as sovereignty acts", a reference to Egyptian legal precedents that could justify such executive action in certain circumstances. The Muslim Brotherhood's party offices in Damanhour, Alexandria, Mansoura, Suez and Cairo were ransacked and damaged {{in the wake of the}} 22 November constitutional declaration. Five hundred people were injured in clashes with the police, and 15-year-old Islam Fathi Masoud died after being hit on the head with a club wielded by <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>dozens</b> of men who attacked the MB's offices in the northern city of Damanhour.
