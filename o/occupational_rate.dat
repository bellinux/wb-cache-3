50|$|Belgium, like {{neighboring}} Netherlands, has {{a strong}} tradition of women fulfilling a predominantly domestic role, rather than a professional one. Roman Catholicism, the traditional religion in Belgium, has supported different gender roles for men and women. However, from the 1990s onward, this has started to change. The occupational gender gap has been decreasing in recent years, especially among younger generations. However, the higher <b>occupational</b> <b>rate</b> of women is primarily due {{to an increase in}} part-time jobs. In 2011, 43.3% of employed women worked part-time, compared to only 9.2% of men. There is also a strong segregation by field, and there are less women in Belgium working in STEM and engineering than the EU average.|$|E
40|$|International audienceHardware Trojans (HTs) are {{ultimately}} a dangerous threat in semiconductor industry. The serious impact of HTs in security applications and global economy brings extreme importance to their detection and prevention techniques. This paper focuses on developing a HT prevention techniques through a layout level design approach. The principle {{is to let}} no available space on silicon for an attacker to insert a HT. Experiments determine the maximum <b>occupational</b> <b>rate</b> and critical empty spaces while filling with standard cells. The proposed technique makes HT insertion nearly impossible...|$|E
40|$|In this study, a {{structure}} for an automated competency management system model is presented. The system involves an advanced approach to competency identification and evaluation {{that takes into}} account the prediction of future activities in competency development. Once competencies are identified and graded for all resources, they are then matched to running projects via a domain of action related to each project. The acknowledged competencies are then linked to a time management factor, or the <b>occupational</b> <b>rate,</b> in a manner that the percentage of time dispensed by each resource on a project in a domain of action including a defined competency is shown. An enrollment criterion for the automated competency management system is proposed. The presented model may be applied for both products and services...|$|E

40|$|Background Occupational risk due to {{airborne}} disease challenges healthcare institutions. Environmental {{measures are}} effective but their cost-effectiveness is still debatable {{and most of}} the capacity planning is based on occupational rates. Better indices to plan and evaluate capacity are needed. Goal To evaluate the impact of installing an exclusively dedicated respiratory isolation room (EDRIR) in a tertiary emergency department (ED) determined by a time-to-reach-facility method. Methods A group of patients in need of respiratory isolation were first identified-group I (2004; 29 patients; 44. 1 +/- 3. 4 years) and the <b>occupational</b> <b>rate</b> and time intervals (arrival to diagnosis, diagnosis to respiratory isolation indication and indication to effective isolation) were determined and it was estimated that adding an EDRIR would have a significant impact over the time to isolation. After implementing the EDRIR, a second group of patients was gathered in the same period of the year-group II (2007; 50 patients; 43. 4 +/- 1. 8 years) and demographic and functional parameters were recorded to evaluate time to isolation. Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, gender and inhospital respiratory isolation room availability were obtained. Results Implementing an EDRIR decreased the time from arrival to indication of respiratory isolation (27. 5 +/- 9. 3 X 3. 7 +/- 2. 0; p = 0. 0180) and from indication to effective respiratory isolation (13. 3 +/- 3. 0 X 2. 94 +/- 1. 06; p = 0. 003) but not the respiratory isolation duration and total hospital stay. The impact on crude isolation rates was very significant (8. 9 X 75. 4 / 100. 000 patients; p < 0. 001). The HR for effective respiratory isolation was 26. 8 (95 % CI 7. 42 to 96. 9) p < 0. 001 greater for 2007. Conclusion Implementing an EDRIR in a tertiary ED significantly reduced the time to respiratory isolation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pelabuhan Hospital Palembang is type C Hospital with a {{capacity}} of 58 beds. The utilization of inpatient unit in this hospital is still lacking. It {{can be seen from}} the total of Bed <b>Occupational</b> <b>Rate</b> (BOR) in 2010 - 2011 is only 48. 52 % - 51. 65 % which is below the standard of Health Department that is 60 - 85 %. Method: This study is a analytical observational study with cross sectional approach. The Population are inpatients of Pelabuhan Hospital Palembang. The number of samples is 80. The research data were analyzed quantitatively by the method of univariate, bivariate with chi square analysis, and multivariate with logistic regression analysis using SPSS program. Result: The result of analysis tests of the relationship between marketing mix and the utilization of inpatient installation of Pelabuhan Hospital Palembang, from 7 variables of marketing mix, there are six variables that have a relationship to the utilization of inpatient installation, that are variable product (OR= 6, p-value=< 0, 0001), price (OR= 10, p-value=< 0, 0001), place (OR = 5, p-value= 0, 001), people (OR= 5, p-value= 0, 002), processes (OR= 7, p-value=< 0, 0001), and physical evidence (OR= 8, p-value=< 0, 0001). Based on the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis, there are four variables of marketing mix which are most influential, namely product (OR= 7, p-value= 0, 008), price (OR= 15, p-value= < 0, 0001), process(OR= 8, p-value= 0, 007) and physical evidence (OR= 18, p-value= < 0, 0001). Conclution: Pelabuhan Hospital Palembang needs to improve the its marketing by noticing the marketing mix variables affecting the utilization of inpatient installations, especially those still considered not good enough by the in-patients,that are person and physical evidence. The goal is to increase BOR of Pelabuhan Hospital Palembang due to Health Department standards...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to test hedonic wage model on data from the Czech labour market {{in order to obtain}} the Value of a Statistical Life from wage differential. In order to support an {{empirical}} basis for using the willingness-to-accept concept as a reliable method, we also examine the statistical relationship between changes in <b>occupational</b> <b>rate</b> of fatal risks and yearly average wages for economic sectors. We confirm statistically significant effect of objective fatal risk rate on employee’s wage for the Czech Republic. Using individual data from the national representative survey conducted in October 2006, we estimate the VSL about 6 million €, while we display higher VSL for the employees exposed to higher occupational risks, particularly for exposed males. We do not confirm significant effect of either objective fatal risks or subjective perception of occupational risk on wage for individual data coming from the 2000 survey. Wage differential is obtained from statistical averages for economic sectors during 2003 - 2005 that also gives us empirical basis for using the willingness-to-pay concept as a reliable method for valuing a life. The VSL derived from macro data, i. e. statistical averages, then ranges between 3. 2 to 3. 6 million €. The VSL’s derived from hedonic wage models are pretty much comparable with the VSL obtained from a CV study on willingness to accept compensation paid through higher wage for increased risk rate by 50 % as well as they are in line with empirical evidence provided by the literature. The VSL’s derived from the Czech labor market are, however, proved to be larger than the VSL’s obtained outside of labor market that are about 0. 2 to 1. 0 million €...|$|E

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of personal networks on changes of <b>occupational</b> <b>rates</b> {{of men and women}} becoming parents. It discusses and measures the effects of various interconnected dimensions of network structures and compositions, such as density, degree of overlap between partners' networks, geographical distance between network members, and types of relations(family, friendship, or others). A set of longitudinal analyses on 235 couples becoming parents in Switzerland shows that for women, higher density in emotional support triggers a reduction in <b>occupational</b> <b>rates</b> once the first child is born, while for men, a higher density in practical support is associated with an increase of <b>occupational</b> <b>rates,</b> with a resulting increase of gender inequalities in the division of paid labour. Results are valid both for intended changes and for changes observed in the transition, and they hold when controlling for parents' educational level, income and personal values about gender equality...|$|R
