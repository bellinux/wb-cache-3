40|$|We {{develop a}} new {{empirical}} approach to identify tradable service activities. Contrary to conventional views of service activities as nontradable, we find {{a significant number of}} service industries and occupations that appear tradable and substantial employment in these tradable activities. Workers employed in tradable service activities differ from those employed in tradable manufacturing and nontradable services. Workers in tradable service activities have higher skill levels and are paid higher wages than manufacturing workers or workers in nontradable service activities. In general, we find little evidence that tradable service activities have lower employment growth than <b>other</b> <b>service</b> <b>activities.</b> However, evidence suggests lower employment growth at the lowest end of the skill distribution. There is also evidence of higher worker displacement rates in tradable services. Workers displaced from tradable service activities are different from displaced manufacturing workers: Displaced tradable service workers have higher skills and higher predisplacement earnings than displaced manufacturing workers. services, offshoring, trade, labor, information technology, jobs...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{trend toward}} {{outsourcing}} manufacturing {{as well as}} product design and <b>other</b> <b>service</b> <b>activities</b> is well-established and apparently accelerating. Within this trend, however, there are examples that are not well-explained by existing theory. In particular, we observe firms outsourcing to suppliers that enjoy no external economies of scale, upstream concentration in ownership, or access to significantly cheaper labor. To explore these seemingly anomalous decisions, we develop a model of outsourcing where decisions {{are affected by the}} product design variables of (1) modularity, defined as the ability to use a generic, externally designed or procured component without a significant loss of performance; (2) relevance, defined as the importance of a component’s performance to the customer or a component’s impact on a product’s variable cost; and (3) development, or fixed costs associated with a component. A key insight is that seemingly perverse outsourcing decisions are rational when competing vertically integrated firms have incentives to overinvest and face the losing outcome of a prisoners ’ dilemma when both development costs and relevance are high. The cost of this investment competition can be larger than the markup of an equally or less concentrated supplier industry even if the supplier(s) does(do) not achieve advantages of scale by serving additional markets. Unexpectedly, we also find that components of low relevance can more profitably be kept in house even in the presence of large additional markets for these components. ...|$|E

O trabalho foi desenvolvido na unidade docente assistencial CSEB-USP, âmbito da Atenção Primária em Saúde, com um grupo de pessoas heterogêneo, constituído por usuários e trabalhadores do serviço, selecionados aleatoriamente, pertencentes a diferentes faixas etárias. Buscou-se conhecer os sentidos atribuídos pelos usuários à intervenção e os reflexos da mesma para o respectivo serviço de saúde. A intervenção com os usuários teve como objetivo: o desenvolvimento da percepção corporal; o alívio de desconfortos, dores e uma melhor ütilização do corpon̈a vida cotidiana. Os resultados confirmaram nossos pressupostos iniciais sobre as melhorias relacionadas ao corpo e à saúde dos usuários do grupo de intervenção e revelaram outras possibilidades de ação do profissional da educação física na assistência à saúde. Verificou-se que há uma demanda de trabalhos com as práticas corporais no serviço público de saúde, para além da ação direta com os usuários. Sua atuação pode se estender para o desenvolvimento de atividades de consultoria e de multiplicação de saberes e práticas para as demais atividades do serviço, assim como, a partir desse, contribuir para a construção de ações direcionadas à comunidade e aos demais equipamentos da rede socialThis {{qualitative}} approach work {{deals with the}} production of professional practice of the physical educator {{within the scope of}} health assistance, through the implementation of bodily practices, permeated by a distinct view of the body (socio-cultural view) and health (collective health; integrality; care and embracement). The development of this work took place in the CSEB-USP support teaching unit, within the scope of Primary Health Assistance, with a heterogeneous group of people, constituted by randomly selected service users and workers, from different age groups. This study aimed to know the meanings attributed by the users concerning the intervention and their reflection on the respective health service. The intervention with users had as objective: the development of body perception; the relief of discomfort and pains and a better üse of the bodyïn daily life. The results confirmed our initial hypothesis on the improvements of the intervention group users body and health and revealed other possibilities for physical education professional actions in health care. It was apparent that there is a demand for work with bodily practices in public health service beyond direct action with users.
