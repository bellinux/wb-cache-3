40|$|The Hot Dry Rock (HDR) concept uses heat {{recovered}} from subsurface rocks <b>to</b> generate <b>electricity.</b> The system proposed for extracting {{heat from the}} rock and <b>onverting</b> it <b>to</b> <b>electricity</b> is comprised of two distinct subsystems (see Figure 1) at very different stages of their technological evolution. The two subsystems are the power plant (on the surface) and the HDR reservoir (deep beneath the surface), which are connected by deep wells. The wells and reservoir are {{thought of as a}} single system, {{often referred to as the}} well field system or reservoir system. The power plant system is largely identical to commercial binary hydrothermal electric plants. The technology for the reservoir Figure 1. Hot dry rock electric power generation schematic. system is much less mature. HDR reservoir creation and use has been demonstrated at experimental sites in the U. S., Europe, and Japan, but not on a commercial scale. The reservoir subsystem is developed by drilling wells into hot rock about 4 kilometers deep, and connecting the wells through hydraulic fracturing. Water, from a nearby fresh water well or other source, is pumped through one or more injection wells into the reservoir, where it is heated by contact with the hot rock, and then recovered through two or more production wells. At the surface, the power plant subsystem converts the extracted heat <b>to</b> <b>electricity</b> using commercial binary power plant technol gy. First, the produced hot water passes through a heat exchanger, transferring heat to a working fluid in the power plant. The working fluid is characterized by a low boiling temperature; hydrocarbons such as iso-pentane, iso...|$|R
40|$|The {{medical care}} in America, while of {{extremely}} high quality, is costly. It is often this high cost which prevents {{those who need}} it most from obtaining, literally, life saving services. This reason alone should be a compelling force for taking a look into the national healthcare systems in place around the world, all of which spend less than America, and usually have longer life expectancies and happier citizens. The resistance to nationalizing healthcare in America, then, is surprising. Upon investigation I realized the majority of this resistance is due to misinformation or ignorance of any system other than the one currently in place. To help inform citizens about nationalized healthcare and to answer pertinent questions by current medical professions about <b>onverting</b> <b>to</b> a nationalized system, I created two pamphlets, one to target each audience.

40|$|TheBaBar {{detector}} {{has operated}} over 200 2 nd generation Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) {{in the forward}} end caps ince 2002. Many chambers have increased noise rates and highvoltage currents. These aging symptoms are correlated with the integrated RPC current as expected, but also depend on the rate {{and direction of the}} gas ﬂow, indicating that pollutants produced in the gas can accelerate aging of downstream RPC surfaces. HFproduced by decomposition of the Freon 134 a component of the BaBar RPC gas inelectric discharges has been proposed as the main pollutant. This paper presents measurements of HFproduction and absorption rates in BaBar RPCs. Since many of the highest rate chambers in the forward end cap were <b>onverted</b> <b>to</b> avalanche mode operation, a comparison of HFproduction in streamer and avalanche mode RPC s is made. Correlations between the HF production rate and other chamber operating conditions were also explored...|$|R

The declared aim of Uganda’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development to increase the access <b>to</b> <b>electricity</b> <b>to</b> 10 % of Uganda’s population implies the electrification of 40, 000 rural household per year, bringing ‘power to the people’. Access <b>to</b> <b>electricity</b> is directly associated {{with higher levels of}} living conditions. Individual households, (rural and urban) when provided with electricity have better conditions of cleanliness, health and self-empowerment. Key institutions in society (private, governmental, non-governmental, parastatal) also require <b>electricity</b> <b>to</b> enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of their operations and programmes. The introduction of SWER (Single Wire Earth Return) technology has significant merits regarding cost effectiveness <b>to</b> supply <b>electricity</b> <b>to</b> remote areas. This is especially the case where a strong backbone reticulation system is in place to supply high load centres (such as mines and larger towns, water pumping installations).
