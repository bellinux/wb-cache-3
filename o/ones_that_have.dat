5|$|The {{common toad}} reaches {{maturity}} at three {{to seven years}} old but there is great variability between populations. Juveniles are often parasitised by the lung nematode Rhabdias bufonis. This slows growth rates and reduces stamina and fitness. Larger juveniles at metamorphosis always outgrow smaller <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been reared in more crowded ponds. Even when they have heavy worm burdens, large juveniles grow faster than smaller individuals with light worm burdens. After several months of heavy worm infection, some juveniles in a study were only half as heavy as control juveniles. Their parasite-induced anorexia caused a decrease in food intake and some died. Another study investigated whether the use of nitrogenous fertilisers affects the development of common toad tadpoles. The toadlets were kept in very dilute solutions of ammonium nitrate of various strengths. It was found that at certain concentrations, which were well above any normally found in the field, growth was increased and metamorphosis accelerated, but at others, {{there was no significant}} difference between the experimental tadpoles and controls. Nevertheless, certain unusual swimming patterns and a few deformities were found among the experimental animals.|$|E

25|$|Males that {{compete for}} more mating {{opportunities}} are the <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> shown less cooperation in breeding. However, {{there are other}} males {{that in order to}} gain access to females and mating opportunities practice parental care. Such parental care is mostly seen in polyandrous mating systems; but they must go through the cost of sharing paternity and parental care. This has been observed in avians like acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus), and fishes as the cichlid fish (Julidochromis transcriptus). Observations that show male relatedness suggest the importance for male social relationships in taking care of offspring. These social relationships in males are seen in primates, Geoffroy's tamarins, Saguinus geoffroyi. High proportions of related males at the half sibling or higher were found.|$|E
25|$|Africa's average {{population}} {{is the youngest}} amongst all the continents; the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4. Algeria is Africa's largest country by area, and Nigeria is its largest by population. Africa, particularly central Eastern Africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the Hominidae clade (great apes), {{as evidenced by the}} discovery of the earliest hominids and their ancestors, as well as later <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been dated to around seven million years ago, including Sahelanthropus tchadensis, Australopithecus africanus, A. afarensis, Homo erectus, H. habilis and H. ergaster—with the earliest Homo sapiens (modern human) found in Ethiopia being dated to circa 200,000 years ago. Africa straddles the equator and encompasses numerous climate areas; it is the only continent to stretch from the northern temperate to southern temperate zones.|$|E

Still, many questions remain concerning these issues, as well as why there seems to have been no male remains found at all. The only definite conclusion that can be drawn from archaeological evidence is that in the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, {{in the vast majority of}} cases, the bodies were not formally deposited within the settlement area.|$|E

25|$|The Temple of Pakhet {{was built}} by Hatshepsut at Beni Hasan in the Minya Governorate south of Al Minya. The name, Pakhet, was a {{synthesis}} that occurred by combining Bast and Sekhmet, who were similar lioness war goddesses, {{in an area that}} bordered the north and south division of their cults. The cavernous underground temple, cut into the rock cliffs on {{the eastern side of the}} Nile, was admired and called the Speos Artemidos by the Greeks during their occupation of Egypt, known as the Ptolemaic Dynasty. They saw the goddess as akin to their hunter goddess Artemis. The temple is thought to have been built alongside much more ancient <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> not survived. This temple has an architrave with a long dedicatory text bearing Hatshepsut's famous denunciation of the Hyksos that has been translated by James P. Allen. They had occupied Egypt and cast it into a cultural decline that persisted until a revival brought about by her policies and innovations. This temple was altered later and some of its inside decorations were usurped by Seti I, in the nineteenth dynasty, attempting to have his name replace that of Hatshepsut.|$|E
