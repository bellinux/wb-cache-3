25|$|The {{production}} designs reflects traditional {{aspects of}} Thai culture. For example, the first gun battle between Mahesuan and Dum {{is set on}} what is <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> sound stage with a painted backdrop, a setting {{that is similar to}} likay, a Thai form of folk opera.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th century, {{the upper}} {{parts of the}} walls were rebuilt with larger dormer windows. Other windows were also enlarged, and the stair wing was rebuilt. Most <b>obviously,</b> <b>a</b> new {{entrance}} and stair {{was added to the}} south, and a new wing to the north.|$|E
25|$|McNaught {{states that}} one Hugh Lamberton, a {{merchant}} of Glasgow, left £300 {{in the early}} 19th century as the Lamberton Mortification {{to be used to}} provide fuel, food or clothing for the local poor. He may have come from Townhead of Lambroughton, as he was <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> man with strong local connections.|$|E

25|$|I {{was told}} he was handing out a few theatre tickets and I didn't suspect {{anything}} because he always looked after the boys. He was close {{to a number of}} players, <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> lot closer than I understood at the time. I didn't have any hint that it wasn't him just organising something for the boys to go to that night.|$|E
25|$|Though it is {{difficult}} to define what can properly be called a 'Cubist sculpture', Picasso's 1909-10 Head bares the hallmarks of early Cubism in that the various surfaces constituting the face and hair are broken down into irregular fragments that meet at sharp angles, rendering practically unreadable the basic volume of the head beneath. These facets are <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> translation from two to three dimensions of the broken planes of Picasso's 1909-10 paintings.|$|E
25|$|Charles Lamkin, {{a former}} {{international}} president of Phi Delta Theta, {{was instrumental in}} the formation of a new national fraternity called Theta Kappa Nu in 1924, and in recruiting some 30 local fraternities to become chapters of Theta Kappa Nu during its first two years. No mention was made in print of his work at the time (<b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> sensitive issue); but he was listed, along with the Four Founders of Theta Kappa Nu, {{as one of the first}} five to have a lifetime subscription to the fraternity's magazine.|$|E

25|$|Augustus circa 27 B.C. {{restored}} Juba II to {{the throne}} as King of Mauretania (to {{the east of the}} Province of Africa). Educated at Rome and <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> client king, Juba also wrote books about the culture and history of Africa, and a best seller about Arabia, writings unfortunately lost. He married Cleopatra Selene, the daughter of Anthony and Cleopatra. After his reign, his kingdom and other lands of the Maghrib were annexed as the Roman Provinces of Mauritania Caesaria and Mauritania Tingitana (approximately the western coast of modern Algeria and northern Morocco).|$|E
25|$|The {{expedition}} {{made two}} unsuccessful attempts {{on the summit}} in early June, and there was time for one more before the heavy snowfall {{that came with the}} summer monsoon would make climbing too dangerous. This last chance fell to the expedition's most experienced climber, George Mallory. To the surprise of other expedition members, Mallory chose the 22-year-old inexperienced Irvine above the older, more seasoned climber, Noel Odell. Irvine's proficiency with the oxygen equipment was <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> major factor in Mallory's decision, but there has been some debate ever since about the precise reasons for his choice.|$|E
25|$|Oddly enough, the Annals of Joseon Dynasty never {{mentions}} the map {{although it was}} <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> national project. Another interesting fact is that this map uses the Ming Chinese era name Jianwen. After the Jianwen Emperor lost to Zhu Di in a civil war, the new emperor banned {{the use of the}} era name Jianwen in the 10th month of 1402. Thus the map should have used the era name Hongwu, not Jianwen. However, the era name Jianwen can be found even on the later Ryūkoku and Honkōji copies. This suggests that the Kangnido was never disclosed to the Chinese.|$|E
50|$|Schlesinger's {{theatrical}} {{career as}} a writer, designer and performer—though <b>obviously</b> <b>an</b> influence on her interviewing style—holds a unique position in New York City's Off-Off Broadway tradition.|$|R
50|$|In 2010, a giant snakehead {{was found}} dead {{on the shores of}} the St. Charles River, in Quebec City, Canada. It was <b>obviously</b> <b>an</b> {{aquarium}} release.|$|R
50|$|Chrysanthos' exegesis {{employed}} the concluding cadence formula of the chromatic plagios devteros which was <b>obviously</b> <b>an</b> exegesis based on psaltic rules, as Manual Chrysaphes had once mentioned them.|$|R
25|$|A simple {{example of}} such a problem is to find the curve of {{shortest}} length connecting two points. If there are no constraints, the solution is <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> straight line between the points. However, if the curve is constrained to lie on a surface in space, then the solution is less obvious, and possibly many solutions may exist. Such solutions are known as geodesics. A related problem is posed by Fermat's principle: light follows the path of shortest optical length connecting two points, where the optical length depends upon the material of the medium. One corresponding concept in mechanics is the principle of least action.|$|E
25|$|Climate, {{especially}} temperature, is <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> {{factor in}} determining distributions of northern flora. Halliday and Brown (1943) suggested that white spruce’s northern limit corresponds “very closely” with the July mean monthly isotherm of 10°C in Ungava, but that the northern limit west of Hudson Bay was south of that isotherm. Other climatic factors that have been suggested as affecting the northern limit of white spruce include: cumulative summer degree days, position of the Arctic front in July, mean net radiation especially during the growing season, and low light intensities (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990). Topography, soil conditions, and glaciation may also be important in controlling northern limits of spruce (Drew and Shanks 1965).|$|E
25|$|World War II helped Queen's {{stay in the}} top league {{a little}} longer as {{at the end of}} 1938–39 season, the club were relegated. Six seasons in the Southern League followed, and it gave youth and many new players a chance to develop at Hampden as the players of before left to serve their country. Bobby Brown was one such player who started at Queen's in 1939 but left in 1941 to serve as a pilot. When he {{returned}} {{at the end of the}} War, he found his goalkeeping position occupied by a teenage Ronnie Simpson who had made his debut at the age of 14. Although <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> bleak time for everyone, this period gave many footballers at Queen's Park an opportunity to play at the highest level under little pressure.|$|E

60|$|The unjust {{distribution}} of wealth must be <b>obviously</b> <b>an</b> evil {{to those who are}} not prosperous, and they are nine tenths of the population. Nevertheless it continues unabated.|$|R
50|$|I'm <b>obviously</b> not <b>a</b> politician. I've {{never run}} for any federal {{elective}} office at all and, you know, {{it is something}} that would <b>obviously</b> require <b>a</b> great deal of effort.|$|R
25|$|Phillips {{declined}} reelection to U.S. House, {{but remained}} at Washington, and continued his legal practice there. When the Civil War began he, being a Unionist, attempted to remain. However, his wife, Eugenia, was quite <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> Southern sympathizer, and allegedly a Confederate spy. In August 1861, U.S. soldiers entered his house, confiscated his papers, arrested {{his wife and}} older daughters, and imprisoned them {{at the home of}} Mrs. Rose Greenhow. Fortunately, he had previously secured the friendship of Edwin M. Stanton, later Secretary of War, who, aided by other prominent Union leaders, arranged for their parole and transportation to the South. After a harrowing trip and a supposed delivery of information to President Jefferson Davis and other Confederate leaders in Richmond, Virginia, they passed on to Savannah, Georgia and ultimately to the expected safety of New Orleans, Louisiana.|$|E
25|$|While an inexperienced rider {{may feel}} more secure with a {{slightly}} too-short stirrup, in reality, it is actually easier to be thrown from the horse because the rider's legs act as a stabilizing agent, much {{in the same way}} the long pole of a tightrope walker balances the acrobat. <b>Obviously,</b> <b>a</b> stirrup leather so long that a rider cannot reach it is useless, and a stirrup length that does not allow a rider with a properly positioned leg to keep the heel lower than the toe is also easily lost. However, shortening the stirrup until the rider feels they will not lose the stirrup is counterproductive; the goal of correct equestrianism is to make maximum use of the leg. Lengthening the leg creates a more secure seat, while shortening the stirrup is done only to accommodate the needs of the horse to perform athletic movement. Thus correct stirrup length creates a balance between control and mobility that fits the discipline performed.|$|E
25|$|The first {{television}} {{adaptation of the}} play was in 1960 when the BBC produced a serial entitled An Age of Kings. The show comprised fifteen sixty- and seventy-five-minute episodes that adapted all eight of Shakespeare's sequential history plays. Directed by Michael Hayes and produced by Peter Dews, with a script by Eric Crozier, the production featured Terry Scully as Henry, Mary Morris as Margaret and Eileen Atkins as Joan. The ninth episode, under the title ' presented a heavily abridged version of 1 Henry VI. With the episode only running one hour, <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> great deal of text was removed (1 Henry VI was the only play in the octology to be screened in one episode, as opposed to split over two). Perhaps the most significant cuts were the complete removal {{of the character of}} Talbot, and the excision of all battle scenes in France.|$|E
5000|$|Empty {{numbers are}} {{sometimes}} made up, with obvious meaning: [...] "squillions" [...] is <b>obviously</b> <b>an</b> empty, but very large, number; a [...] "squintillionth" [...] {{would be a}} very small number.|$|R
5000|$|Heath also clarifies the book's optimistic title, {{stating that}} it is <b>obviously</b> <b>an</b> exaggeration. He claims that [...] "as close to utopia as it gets" [...] may in fact not be very close at all.|$|R
60|$|Pussi was right. But {{it was not}} his dress, so much as his gait and expression, {{that were}} funny. For the {{stranger}} was <b>obviously</b> <b>an</b> Eskimo, being flat and fat-visaged, black-and-straight haired, and seal-skinnily clad.|$|R
25|$|Prosper {{associates}} Palladius' {{appointment with}} the visits of Germanus of Auxerre to Britain to suppress Pelagianism {{and it has been}} suggested that Palladius and his colleagues were sent to Ireland to ensure that exiled Pelagians did not establish themselves among the Irish Christians. The appointment of Palladius and his fellow-bishops was not <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> mission to convert the Irish, but more probably intended to minister to existing Christian communities in Ireland. The sites of churches associated with Palladius and his colleagues are close to royal centres of the period: Secundus is remembered by Dunshaughlin, County Meath, close to the Hill of Tara which is associated with the High King of Ireland; Killashee, County Kildare, close to Naas with links with the kings of Leinster, is probably named for Auxilius. This activity was limited to the southern half of Ireland, and there is no evidence for them in Ulster or Connacht.|$|E
25|$|The {{door frame}} for this opening is highly altered {{in almost every}} detail with the {{exception}} of the basic size. The door itself may be original but is almost certainly of old if not of colonial origin. It consists of a pair of narrow, white battened doors opening at the center. Each door has a pair of vertical recessed panels on the top and bottom half, comprising four panels on each door. The brick arch is <b>obviously</b> <b>a</b> replacement, but the wooden door trim consisting of two vertical frames surmounted by a horizontal board bearing a chamfer and lamb’s tongue molding may be of colonial age. The vertical frame members extend beyond the lintel to the bottom of the brick arch. The space between the arch and the top board is filled with flat plaster. The sill is a simple wooden one. In all likelihood, this opening had a pediment of unknown appearance in colonial days. It is the only door in the church that has a lock and key. These are of modern origin.|$|E
