5000|$|The default macOS {{file system}} is HFS+, which it {{inherited}} from the classic Mac OS. Operating system designer Linus Torvalds has criticized HFS+, saying it is [...] "probably the worst file system ever", whose design is [...] "actively corrupting user data". He criticized the case insensitivity of file names, a design made worse when Apple extended the file system to support Unicode. Initially, HFS+ was designed for classic Mac OS, which runs on big-endian 68K and PowerPC systems. When Apple switched Macintosh to little-endian Intel processors, it continued to use big-endian byte <b>order</b> <b>on</b> HFS+ <b>file</b> systems. As a result, macOS on current Macs must do byte swap when it reads file system data. These concerns are being addressed with the new Apple File System, which {{will be included in}} a later update.|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} lecture, {{we looked at}} the cache-oblivious model, in which the machine has two levels of memory, one much larger and slower than the other, but where the memory system is {{controlled}} automatically, so that our algorithm doesn’t see the size of the blocks or the cache. We also looked at cache-oblivious B-trees. In this lecture, we look inside a black box from the last lecture: <b>ordered</b> <b>file</b> maintenance. We then examine ordered queries in lists, a topic related to <b>ordered</b> <b>file</b> maintenance. Finally, we learn how to implement cache-oblivious priority queues. 2 <b>Ordered</b> <b>File</b> Maintenance The problem is posed as follows: maintain N elements in an array of size O(N) in a specified order, with at most O(1) gaps between two consecutive elements, subject to inserting and deleting in a specified place in the order. We show how to implement updates by moving a portion of the array of size O(lg 2 N), amortized. Since gaps are bounded, scanning k consecutive elements takes O(1 + k B) memory transfers, even cache-obliviously; inserting and deleting take O (lg 2 N B). Th...|$|R
