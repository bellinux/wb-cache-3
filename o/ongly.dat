40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis focuses on the M 2 family of metalloproteases, in particular A<;E 2 andÃ‚Â·ACE 3, two recently discovered homologues of the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE). ACE is an important, well validated. cardiovascular disease target and the key enzyme in the Renin-Angiotensin System. ACE 2 increases the complexity of this system by counter regulating ACE and is currently under intense biological investigation. Another homologue, ACE 3, was first identified in mouse. Here, we further investigate its.. biological role. A range of computational methods are used to investigate these enzymes from a structural and functional perspective. This involves close collaboration with experimental researchers throughout these studies.. 'Ẇe investigate ACE 3 in several organisms and compare it to other ACE family members. In addition, homology modelling is undertaken based on the AC. E crystal structure to analyse the structural conservation of the active site. The mutation of Glu 386 to GIn in the catalytic HEXXH zinc binding motif, {{as well as a}} number of other active site mutations are found to be critical i disrupting catalytic activity in ACE 3. Comparative genomics reveals that the ACE 3 gene is present in several mammalian species (Le. rat, mouse, dog and cow) and located downstream in close proximity of the ACE gene. The inferred amino acid sequences are st <b>ongly</b> conserved amongst all putative ACE 3 orthologues in te s of sequence identity (up to 81...|$|E
40|$|This article {{concerns}} the adsorption of the diblock polyampholyte poly(methacrylic acid) -block-poly((dimethylamino) ethyl methary-late) (PMAA-b-PDMAEMA) from aqueous solution on silicon substrates. The investigated polyampholyte {{is characterized by}} a small molecular weight around 15, 000 g/mol and a big positively charged PDMAEMA block. The adsorbed amount determined by ellipsom-etry was str <b>ongly</b> influenced by the pH of the adsorption solution. Using dynamic light scattering polyampholytic structures with diameters around 50 nm were found in aqueous solution. The hy-drodynamic diameter was hardly affected by changing the pH of the polymer solution. Analogous regular structures were also found by scanning force microscopy (SFM) and grazing incidence, small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) at the silicon surface after the adsorption process. While SFM provides a topographical image of {{a small part of the}} adsorbed polyampholytic layer; GISAXS was used to get a statistical description of the lateral surface structures. The adsorbed structures were highly regular and their sizes were nearly pH independent over a lar ge pH region. Only directly at the isoelectric point of the polyampholyte larger adsorbed structures were observed. Compared with earlier investigated PMAA-b-PDMAEMA systems we are now able to prepare highly regular polyampholytic structures at silicon surfaces. There are two kinds of interactions for the adsorbed micelles. First, the charged block of the chains is directly attracted to the substrate via electrostatic interactions, while the uncharged part of the chains is only hydrophobically attracted via the hydrophobic core of the adsorbed micelle.

40|$|The {{scaling down}} of the metal oxide {{semiconductor}} field-effect transisto r (MOSFET) has fostered {{the development of new}} characterization techniqu es that must be able to probe features of ever smaller dimensions. One o f the key elements is the control of the properties of the ultra-shallow junctions (USJs) encountered in the source and drain extension regions of a MOSFE T. In this thesis, we have developed the theory of photo modulated optical reflectance (PMOR) for the characterization of USJs in silicon. We have assessed the theory by comparing it with experimental measurements on Bo ron doped chemical vapour deposition box-like profiles acquired with the Carrier Illumination (CI) metrology tool. CI allows to measure the prob e laser differential reflectance {{as a function of the}} power of the pump laser, also known as a power curve. The possibilities and lim itations of PMOR and especially of PMOR on CI have been deeply assessed. The work has been divided into two main tasks, namely the direct and the inverse problem. The direct problem, i. e. the simulation of a power cur ve from a known active doping profile, has been addressed through the de velopment of a finite element code for the simulation of a semiconductor under optical injection, of suitable approximations and of compact expr essions for speed optimization as needed for solving the inverse problem. The inverse problem, i. e. the reconstruction of the active doping profile from a given power curve, has been addressed using different methods of increasing complexi ties, including direct nonlinear optimization based on iterations on the direct problem. We have shown that CI was able to reconstruct box-like doping profiles w ith junction depths in the range 15 - 70 nm and with active doping concent rations of up to 1 e 20 /cm 3. The accuracy of the technique is however str <b>ongly</b> affected by surface recombinations, which limits its practical use in the present implementation. We believe, however, that this limitatio n could be eliminated by using an ultrafast (sub-picosecond) pumping mec hanism, and we have proposed a reconstruction method that would be suite d for the reconstruction of arbitrary monotonic non-retrograde doping pr ofiles. 1 Introduction 1. 1 Motivation 1. 2 Overview of USJ characterization 1. 2. 1 Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy (1 D) 1. 2. 2 Spreading Resistance Probe (1 D) 1. 2. 3 Micro Four Point Probe (0 D/ 1 D) 1. 2. 4 Scanning Spreading Resistance Microscopy (2 D) 1. 2. 5 Electron holography (1 D) 1. 2. 6 Junction Photo Voltage (0 D) 1. 2. 7 Others 1. 3 Optical probes for USJ characterization 1. 3. 1 Reflectometry and Ellipsometry 1. 3. 2 Photo Modulated Optical Reflectance 1. 3. 2. 1 Generalities 1. 3. 2. 2 CI State of the art and objective 1. 4 Content 2 Experimental setup 2. 1 Hardware setup 2. 2 Measurement conditions 3 Optical modeling 3. 1 Fourier Components (signals) 3. 2 Reflectance 3. 2. 1 First order reflection 3. 2. 2 First order Maxwell wave equation 3. 2. 3 Transfert matrix formulation 3. 2. 4 Comparison 3. 2. 5 Lateral integration 3. 3 Refractive index 3. 3. 1 The thermo-optic model (Jellison) 3. 3. 2 The electro-optic free carrier absorption model (Drude) 3. 3. 3 The electro-optic free carrier absorption model (Schumann) 3. 3. 4 The band-to-band absorption model (Smith) 3. 4 Summary 4 Material modeling 4. 1 Plasma 4. 1. 1 The drift-di�ffusion equations 4. 1. 2 The ambipolar diff�usion equation 4. 1. 3 The steady-periodic ambipolar diff�usion equations 4. 1. 4 Absorption and optical generation models 4. 1. 5 Bulk Recombination models 4. 1. 6 Surface Recombination models 4. 1. 6. 1 Single trapping center 4. 1. 6. 2 Pb center 4. 1. 7 Band Gap Narrowing models 4. 1. 8 Mobility and Diff�usivity models 4. 2 Temperature 4. 2. 1 The heat equation 4. 2. 2 Heat generation model 4. 2. 3 Analytical solution 4. 3 General solution of the Helmholtz equation 4. 4 Finite element formulation 4. 4. 1 The Gummel map for the DD equations in Slotboom's variables 4. 4. 2 Resolution flow chart 5 Experiment vs. Theory 5. 1 Surface charging 5. 1. 1 The capacitor model 5. 1. 2 Removal of the charging contribution 5. 2 Uniform doping 5. 2. 1 Experimental data 5. 2. 2 General information about the simulation 5. 2. 3 MEDICI vs. FSEM 5. 2. 4 Analysis of the models 5. 2. 4. 1 Bulk recombinations 5. 2. 4. 2 Surface recombinations 5. 2. 4. 3 Mobilities 5. 2. 4. 4 Injection dependent BGN 5. 2. 4. 5 High illumination power (GW/cm 2) 5. 2. 4. 6 Frequency eff�ects 5. 3 Nonuniform doping 5. 3. 1 Experimental data 5. 3. 2 Preliminary analysis of the experimental data 5. 3. 2. 1 Temperature dependence on the layer thickness 5. 3. 2. 2 Impact of the lateral pro�le on the signal 5. 3. 3 General information about the simulations 5. 3. 4 MEDICI vs. FSEM solutions 5. 3. 5 General behavior of the solution 5. 3. 6 Analysis of the models 5. 3. 6. 1 Injection dependent BGN 5. 3. 6. 2 Surface Recombinations 5. 3. 6. 3 Layer mobility 5. 4 Conclusion 6 Approximated Solutions 6. 1 Nonlinear currentless approximation 6. 2 Flat Quasi Fermi Level (FQL) and Doping Layer Invariant Bulk Level (LIBL) approximations 6. 2. 1 Excess carrier concentration in the layer 6. 2. 2 Lateral decay length in the layer 6. 2. 3 Junction potential 6. 2. 4 Extension to arbitrary pro�files 6. 2. 5 LIBL approximation validity 6. 2. 6 FQL approximation validity 6. 3 Conclusion 7 Inverse Problem 7. 1 The inflection point method 7. 2 The high vs low power derivative method 7. 2. 1 Error estimation by Monte-Carlo approach 7. 3 Direct optimization 7. 4 Backward deconvolution by staircase doping pro�file approximation 7. 5 Conclusion 8 Conclusions A APPENDIX A. 1 BX 10 data A. 1. 1 BX 10 output �file description A. 1. 2 Normalized R 1 legacy calculation A. 1. 3 Laser power uncertainty A. 2 Reference phase calculation A. 3 n,k, K 1;
