5|$|Traditionally, {{religious}} {{language has}} been explained as via negativa, analogy, symbolism, or myth, {{each of which}} describes a way <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> about God in human terms. The via negativa {{is a way of}} referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise ineffable experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} {{research}} into teachers' and pupils' perceptions <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> in school. Drawing on sociocultural perspectives, {{it shows that}} expectations <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> are grounded in particular sociocultural values that represent hegemonic interpretations of the quality <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> and classroom discourse. Although {{much has been written}} about classroom talk, the pupils' voice is often absent from discussion. The children in this study revealed very different views of the expectations <b>of</b> <b>talk</b> from that <b>of</b> their teachers'. In particular, they appeared uncertain about whether their teachers liked them to talk but they seemed very clear that the teacher was in control <b>of</b> the <b>talk.</b> Despite pupils' enthusiasm for talk, their teachers held negative views of certain pupils' performance. It is argued that both pupils' and teachers' expectations are guided more by their own perceptions of an ideal state than by pedagogic or heuristic motives...|$|R
