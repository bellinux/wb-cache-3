25|$|In 1894 Lockwood and Richardson, {{with their}} pace and sharp break-back, were an irresistible {{combination}} {{on the many}} treacherous wickets. Lockwood's bowling reached its highest point, though, against Yorkshire at the Oval when Richardson was injured: he took 7 for 94 on a very true pitch to win the match that decided the Championship. Lockwood's batting did not suffer from the advance of his bowling: indeed he frequently opened with Bobby Abel in 1894 and scored <b>over</b> 900 <b>runs</b> <b>under</b> the most difficult conditions. After demolishing Kent on a perfect batting wicket in the last match at The Oval, he and Richardson were chosen to tour Australia.|$|R

These two factors allowed individual BP2 programs to be much larger than BASIC-PLUS programs, often reducing the need for CHAINing among multiple programs.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a morphological lexicon for English that handle more than 317000 inflected forms derived from over 90000 stems. The lexicon {{is available in}} two formats. The first {{can be used by}} an implementation of a two-level processor for morphological analysis (Karttunen and Wittenburg, 1983; Antworth, 1990). The second, derived from the first one for efficiency reasons, consists of a disk-based database using a UNIX hash table facility (Seltzer and Yigit, 1991). We also built an X Window tool to facilitate the maintenance and browsing of the lexicon. The package is ready to be integrated into an natural language application such as a parser through hooks written in Lisp and C. To our knowledge, this package is the only available free English morphological analyzer with very wide coverage. attributes. To improve performance, we used PCKIMMO as a generator on our lexicons to build a diskbased hashed database with a UNIX database facility (Seltzer and Yigit, 1991). We also provide an X Window tool for the database to facilitate maintenance and access. Each format contains the morphological information for over 317000 English words.
