5|$|The emergentist {{coalition}} model {{suggests that}} children {{make use of}} multiple cues to successfully attach a novel label to a novel object. The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social, perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic cues. While a range of cues {{are available from the}} start of word learning, it may be the case that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process. While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues, older, more experienced word learners may be able to make use of a range of cues. For instance, young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience, but older children attend to the gaze <b>of</b> <b>caregivers</b> and use the focus <b>of</b> <b>caregivers</b> to direct their word mapping. Therefore, this model argues that principles or cues may be present from the onset of word learning, but the use {{of a wide range of}} cues develops over time.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{disorder}} {{is a broad}} term intended to describe disorders of mood, behavior, and social relationships arising from a failure to form normal attachments to primary care giving figures in early childhood. Such a failure would result from unusual early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between 6 months and three years of age, frequent change or excessive numbers <b>of</b> <b>caregivers,</b> or lack of caregiver responsiveness to child communicative efforts resulting in a lack of basic trust. A problematic history of social relationships occurring after about age three may be distressing to a child, but does not result in attachment disorder.|$|E

5|$|While domain-specific {{accounts}} of word learning argue for innate constraints that limit infants' hypotheses about word meanings, domain-general perspectives argue that word learning can {{be accounted for}} by general cognitive processes, such as learning and memory, which are not specific to language.

According to some research, however, children are active participants in their own word learning, although caregivers may still {{play an important role in}} this process. Recently, an emergentist coalition model has also been proposed to suggest that word learning cannot be fully attributed to a single factor. Instead, a variety of cues, including salient and social cues, may be utilized by infants at different points in their vocabulary development.|$|E

40|$|Background: Research {{has shown}} that <b>caregivers</b> <b>of</b> persons with {{psychosis}} play an invaluable role in recovery, but unfortunately, often report high levels of distress. While cognitive models <b>of</b> <b>caregiver</b> distress have been well-supported, there is still limited knowledge of the psychological factors involved. Recent advances in cognitive behavioral therapy seem to converge {{on the importance of}} acceptance- and mindfulness based processes. Aim: To examine the impact of psychological flexibility on caregiver distress in the early phases of psychosis, while controlling for known predictors <b>of</b> <b>caregiver</b> distress. Method: Within a cross-sectional design, 101 <b>caregivers</b> <b>of</b> 38 persons with first-episode psychosis in a clinical epidemiological sample completed a series of self-report measures. Results: A linear mixed model analysis found that, after controlling for caregiver socio-demographic factors, service user symptoms, drug use and global functioning, psychological flexibility was a significant predictor <b>of</b> <b>caregiver</b> distress. Conclusion: Greater level of psychological flexibility in caregivers, seems to be related to lower levels <b>of</b> <b>caregiver</b> distress. This finding corresponds to studies within a broad range of emotional disorders. There may be important clinical implications in terms of facilitating the process of acceptance through interventions from the ‘third-wave’ or contextual cognitive behavioral therapies...|$|R

40|$|Background: Burden in {{dementia}} caregivers is {{a complex}} and multidimensional construct. Several models of burden and other representations of burden like depression or mental health are described in literature. To clarify the state of science, we systematically reviewed complex models that include both patient and <b>caregiver</b> determinants <b>of</b> <b>caregiver</b> burden. Objective: A review of determinant models <b>of</b> <b>caregiver</b> burden. Design: Systematic review. Data sources: Electronic databases PubMed, PsycInfo and EMbase were searched in December 2013. Study selection and analysis: Research studies with quantitative outcome measures <b>of</b> <b>caregiver</b> burden or burden-related concepts, including both patient and caregiver functional characteristics as determinants. We categorized the determinant variables in the models and calculated the percentages of proven determinants within each category. Results: We found 32 studies with burden models and 24 depression and mental health models. Patient behavioral problems, caregiver coping and personality traits and competence are most consistent determinants <b>of</b> <b>caregiver</b> burden, depression and mental health.

A basic primate repertoire of vocal signals may have been insufficient for this social challenge.

25|$|There is {{a strong}} {{correlation}} between child abuse, especially child sexual abuse, and development of BPD. Many individuals with BPD report a history of abuse and neglect as young children, but causation is still debated. Patients with BPD {{have been found to be}} significantly more likely to report having been verbally, emotionally, physically, or sexually abused by caregivers of either gender. They also report a high incidence of incest and loss <b>of</b> <b>caregivers</b> in early childhood. Individuals with BPD were also likely to report having caregivers of both sexes deny the validity of their thoughts and feelings. Caregivers were also reported to have failed to provide needed protection and to have neglected their child's physical care. Parents of both sexes were typically reported to have withdrawn from the child emotionally and to have treated the child inconsistently. Additionally, women with BPD who reported a previous history of neglect by a female caregiver and abuse by a male caregiver were significantly more likely to experience sexual abuse by a non-caregiver.|$|E
500|$|RAD {{arises from}} {{a failure to}} form normal {{attachments}} to primary caregivers in early childhood. Such a failure could result from severe early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers {{between the ages of}} six months and three years, frequent change <b>of</b> <b>caregivers,</b> or a lack of caregiver responsiveness to a child's communicative efforts. Not all, or even a majority of such experiences, result in the disorder. It is differentiated from pervasive developmental disorder or developmental delay and from possibly comorbid conditions such as intellectual disability, all of which can affect attachment behavior. The criteria for a diagnosis of a reactive attachment disorder are very different from the criteria used in assessment or categorization of attachment styles such as insecure or disorganized attachment.|$|E

500|$|According to Michael Rutter, the {{importance}} of Bowlby's initial writings on [...] "maternal deprivation" [...] lay in his emphasis that children's experiences of interpersonal relationships were crucial to their psychological development and that {{the formation of an}} ongoing relationship with the child was as important a part of parenting as the provision of experiences, discipline and child care. Although this view was rejected by many at the time, the argument focussed attention on the need to consider parenting in terms of consistency <b>of</b> <b>caregivers</b> over time and parental sensitivity to children's individuality and it is now generally accepted. Bowlby's theory sparked considerable interest and controversy in the nature of early relationships and gave a strong impetus to what Mary Ainsworth described as a [...] "great body of research" [...] in what was perceived as an extremely difficult and complex area.|$|E

2500|$|Like {{a number}} of other {{alternative}} mental health treatments for children, attachment therapy is based on some assumptions that differ strongly from the theoretical foundations of other attachment based therapies. In contrast to traditional attachment theory, the theory of attachment described by attachment therapy proponents is that young children who experience adversity (including maltreatment, loss, separations, adoption, frequent changes in child care, colic or even frequent ear infections) become enraged at a very deep and primitive level. This results in a lack of ability to attach or to be genuinely affectionate to others. Suppressed or unconscious rage is theorized to prevent the child from forming bonds with caregivers and leads to behavior problems when the rage erupts into unchecked aggression. Such children are said to fail to develop a conscience, to not trust others, to seek control rather than closeness, to resist the authority <b>of</b> <b>caregivers,</b> and to engage in endless power struggles. They are seen as highly manipulative and as trying to avoid true attachments while simultaneously striving to control those around them through manipulation and superficial sociability. Such children are said to be at risk of becoming psychopaths who will go on to engage in very serious delinquent, criminal, and antisocial behaviors if left untreated. The tone in which the attributes of these children are described has been characterized as [...] "demonizing".|$|E
