After winning a number one contender's Diva battle royal on Raw in which she first eliminated Wilson and then Mickie James and Ashley at the same time, Candice Michelle received her first singles WWE Women's Championship match, but she lost to champion Trish Stratus on February 27. After the match, Candice Michelle slapped Wilson, blaming her, in storyline, for the loss.

More typical of science {{at the time were}} the qualitative studies of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension.</b> These observations lay {{within the framework of the}} Pythagorean tradition of music, well-known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale.

He said that such ads were indecent and should be prohibited on radio and television between the hours of 6am and 10pm, in accordance with Federal Communications Commission policy. Later that year, Moran and former presidential candidate and former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean held a town hall meeting on the issue of health care at South Lakes High School in Reston, Virginia. The meeting was interrupted several times by protesters, most notably pro-life activist Randall Terry, who, along with about half a dozen supporters, caused such a commotion that he had to be escorted out by police.

5|$|Tension {{forces can}} be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be {{combined}} with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object {{is accompanied by a}} force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object {{through the use of a}} set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> force in the string acts on the load. However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move the load. These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>tensioning</b> stress {{distribution}} <b>of</b> {{circular saw blade}} after roll tensioning was described by Szymani [2]. In <b>the</b> inner loop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tensioned</b> region, <b>the</b> tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress is compressive, and its value increases gradually from loop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tensioned</b> region to inside. In <b>the</b> exterior loop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tensioned</b> region, <b>the</b> tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress is tensile, and its value decreases gradually from loop <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tensioned</b> region to outside. This distribution of tangential tensioning stress is not very ideal relatively. <b>The</b> tangential <b>tensioning</b> stresses <b>of</b> circular saw blades tensioned by three levels of hammering were measured by X-ray stress meter [3, 4]. <b>The</b> tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress outside hammer region increases with radius, which is an ideal distribution. This phenomenon indicates that <b>the</b> distribution <b>of</b> tangential <b>tensioning</b> stress produced by hammering is more reasonable than that produced by roll tensioning. However, hammer tensioning has its limitations because <b>the</b> hammer <b>tensioning</b> creates a very irregular surface and produce localized, non-axisymmetric stresses because the force and position of spots are controlled by workers and its reproducibility and controllability {{are very difficult to}} be mastered, and it depends heavily on the experience and skills of saw repairing workers. <b>The</b> precision <b>of</b> hammer <b>tensioning</b> is relatively poor. Multi-spot pressure tensioning process is one kind of tensioning methods and a quasi-static process. <b>The</b> fixed areas <b>of</b> circular saw blade are pressed by spherical or cylindrical surface during multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process. <b>The</b> force and position of spots are controlled precisely by automated machinery during <b>the</b> multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process. A cyclic symmetry {{stress distribution}} and appropriate macroscopic deformation can be obtained by <b>the</b> multi-spot pressure <b>tensioning</b> process. Therefore, a more ideal distribution of tangential tensioning stress is produced during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. This tensioning approach is conducive to <b>the</b> realization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automatic <b>tensioning</b> operation, especially in <b>the</b> production <b>of</b> ultra-thin circular saw blades.|$|R

25|$|Smokers often {{report that}} {{cigarettes}} help relieve feelings of stress. However, the stress levels of adult smokers are {{slightly higher than}} those of nonsmokers. Adolescent smokers report increasing levels of stress as they develop regular patterns of smoking, and smoking cessation leads to reduced stress. Far from acting as an aid for mood control, nicotine dependency seems to exacerbate stress. This is confirmed in the daily mood patterns described by smokers, with normal moods during smoking and worsening moods between cigarettes. Thus, the apparent relaxant effect of smoking only reflects the reversal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> and irritability that develop during nicotine depletion. Dependent smokers need nicotine to remain feeling normal.|$|E

25|$|Newton {{examined}} {{this problem}} himself using rotating spheres, {{as shown in}} Figure 2 and Figure 3. He pointed out that if the spheres are not rotating, {{the tension in the}} tying string is measured as zero in every frame of reference. If the spheres only appear to rotate (that is, we are watching stationary spheres from a rotating frame), the zero tension in the string is accounted for by observing that the centripetal force is supplied by the centrifugal and Coriolis forces in combination, so no tension is needed. If the spheres really are rotating, the tension observed is exactly the centripetal force required by the circular motion. Thus, measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tension</b> in the string identifies the inertial frame: it is the one where the tension in the string provides exactly the centripetal force demanded by the motion as it is observed in that frame, and not a different value. That is, the inertial frame is the one where the fictitious forces vanish.|$|E

Each character has his or her definition of what the dilemma is, as well as a means for resolving it. The tension in the play rises with the rise of emotions as the characters move toward a climax or a moment of truth. This moment is played out most specifically by Tobias and Harry in the conversation that defines their friendship: one that is built on rights and responsibilities rather than love and affection.
