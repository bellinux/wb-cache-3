He served {{as a member of the}} target {{committee}} established by Groves to select Japanese cities for atomic bombing, and on Tinian with Project Alberta as a special consultant. Along with Group Captain Leonard Cheshire, sent by Wilson as a British representative, he watched the bombing of Nagasaki from the <b>observation</b> <b>plane</b> Big Stink. He also formed part of the Manhattan Project's post-war scientific mission to Hiroshima and Nagasaki that assessed the extent of the damage caused by the bombs.|$|E
5|$|Purnell, Parsons, Paul Tibbets, Spaatz and Curtis LeMay met on Guam on 7 August, the {{day after}} the Hiroshima attack, to discuss what should be done next. Parsons said that Project Alberta would have a Fat Man bomb ready by 11 August, as {{originally}} planned, but Tibbets pointed to weather reports indicating poor flying conditions on that day due to a storm, and asked if it could be readied by 9 August. Parsons agreed to do so. For this mission, Ashworth was the weaponeer, with Lieutenant Philip M. Barnes, of the 1st Ordnance Squadron as assistant weaponeer on the B-29 Bockscar. Walter Goodman and Lawrence H. Johnston were on board the instrumentation aircraft, The Great Artiste. Leonard Cheshire and William Penney were on the <b>observation</b> <b>plane</b> Big Stink. Robert Serber was supposed to be on board but was left behind by the aircraft commander because he had forgotten his parachute.|$|E

In the following days, the submarine patrolled the northern and western approaches to the islands.|$|E
25|$|Bryson {{was educated}} at Bromsgrove School, {{and joined the}} Queen's Own Dorset Yeomanry in 1914. Shortly thereafter, he was wounded in action. While serving in Egypt, he {{transferred}} to the Royal Flying Corps. On 15 March 1917, after a flaming crash, he rescued his fellow aircrew member. In July 1917, he was posted to fly a SPAD for 19 Squadron in France. His first aerial victory followed shortly; he drove down a German <b>observation</b> <b>plane</b> down out of control on 25 August.

For many years this airfield was simply called the Artillery Range Airport Camp.|$|R
25|$|That same day, {{a search}} party was formed and {{dispatched}} to the site {{under the command of}} Captain Harry Cobb RCAF. With no access to the site, the group had to trail-blaze its way through the forest guided by an <b>observation</b> <b>plane</b> which would nose dive to indicate the location of the wreckage. According to Cobb's testimony, all passengers were killed on impact, which was also confirmed by Dr. J.-A. Melançon, the coroner, who reported the deaths as being accidental. The aircraft had caught fire with only some assemblies, the rear fuselage and the engines having been spared by the blaze. Of the crew and passengers, only three bodies could be identified.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the general}} {{failure of the}} Nivelle Offensive and the ensuing mutinies, French High Command in May 1917 tried {{to make use of}} the force {{concentration}} at the Aisne by at least conquering the notorious Chemin-des-Dames positions. Part of the plan was a limited but strategically important objective: the German saillant east of Laffaux where the Hindenburg Line hinged on the Chemin-des-Dames, named after the hillock of the Moulin-de-Laffaux. This attack was to be supported by Groupement Lefebvre. To improve the cooperation with the infantry, the Groupement was reinforced by an infantry battalion specially trained in combined arms tactics, the 17e Bataillon de Chasseurs à Pied. Coordination with the artillery was improved by attaching a special <b>observation</b> <b>plane,</b> protected by six SPAD VII fighters, that had to identify German antitank-batteries and have them destroyed by counterbattery fire; it also had to report the position of the tanks to higher command levels.|$|E
25|$|On {{the next}} day, Peck's train was ambushed {{again in the}} same area as before. This time, the Chinese had torn up about 400 yards or the {{railroad}} tracks, and the workers sent to fix them had been killed or wounded by land mines. Since it was expected that repair work on the railroad would take at least two days, Peck returned to Tangshan and boarded an <b>observation</b> <b>plane,</b> in order to fly to Chinwangtao. The Kuyeh incident demonstrated the need for a strong Nationalist offensive action to clear the railroad line, and to arrange this, General Peck was authorized to deal directly with Lieutenant General Tu Li-ming, who was the commanding general in the Northeast China Command. Li-ming agreed to drive back the Communists and avoid Marine positions while doing so, in order to keep American forces out of the conflict. The Marines, in turn, would help release Nationalist troops for the operation by assuming responsibility for guarding all rail bridges over 100 meters long between Tangku and Chinwangtao, a distance of approximately 135 miles. Even before taking on these new responsibilities, the 7th Marines was short on manpower. As a result, 1st Battalion, 29th Marines, 6th Division, was transferred from Tsingtao to Hopeh and placed under the 7th Marines' operational control.|$|E

50|$|The {{squadron}} {{was first}} activated at March Field, California in 1951 as the 31st Army Reconnaissance Squadron, flying light <b>observation</b> <b>planes.</b> After the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the squadron flew antisubmarine patrols over the Pacific coast in 1942. It {{was moved to}} the Southeastern United States in late 1942.|$|R
500|$|The {{test was}} {{scheduled}} for May 5, but was postponed for two days to allow for more equipment to be installed. Requests for further postponements had to be refused because they would have impacted the schedule for the main test. The detonation time was set for 04:00 Mountain War Time (MWT), on May 7, {{but there was a}} 37-minute delay to allow the <b>observation</b> <b>plane,</b> a Boeing B-29 Superfortress from the 216th Army Air Forces Base Unit flown by Major Clyde [...] "Stan" [...] Shields, to get into position.|$|E
500|$|For this mission, Ashworth was the weaponeer, with Lieutenant Philip M. Barnes, USN, of the 1st Ordnance Squadron as his {{assistant}} weaponeer on the B-29 Bockscar.

500|$|Selected {{to return}} to action in the Pacific Theater in late 1944, she transited the Panama Canal on 27 November, and arrived in Long Beach, California on 9 December, {{breaking}} down at least once along the way and losing an <b>observation</b> <b>plane</b> in bad weather. She conducted refresher training off Southern California in December 1944 and January 1945. New York departed 12 January and rendezvoused with , , , Texas, and , forming a support force for the invasion of Iwo Jima. New York lost a blade off her port screw just before the invasion began and briefly put in for temporary repairs at Eniwetok from 5 to 7 February. She returned to the group, which was near Saipan, on 11 February. Together, they arrived at Iwo Jima on 16 February and began the pre-invasion bombardment. During the three days of shore bombardment that followed, New York expended 6,417 rounds, including 1,037 14-inch rounds. One of her salvoes struck the primary ammunition dump on the island, causing [...] "the most spectacular secondary explosion in the campaign." [...] She retired from the area on 19 February and arrived at Ulithi on 21 February.|$|E

He {{had been in the}} <b>observation</b> <b>plane</b> Big Stink during the bombing of Nagasaki, and had done damage assessment on the ground following Japan's surrender. He had returned to England in November 1945 intending to resume his academic career, but was approached by C. P. Snow, one of the Civil Service Commissioners, and asked to become Chief Superintendent Armament Research (CSAR, pronounced [...] "Caesar"), in charge of the Ministry of Supply's Armaments Research Department (ARD) at Fort Halstead in Kent. His appointment as CSAR was announced on 1 January 1946, but Groves asked him to assist in the American Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll. Penney left for the United States in March 1946, and did not return to Britain until October 1946. Portal then asked him to draw up a scheme for an Atomic Weapons Section within the Armaments Research Department which would design, develop and construct atomic bombs. In his 1 November 1946 report to Portal, which he had to type himself for security reasons, Penney provided a proposed organisation chart, detailed his staffing requirements, and listed his accommodation requirements, which he felt could be met at Fort Halstead, the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, and Shoeburyness.|$|E
