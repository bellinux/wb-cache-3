The character was intended to be killed off at the end of the season, and a version of that was filmed, but the writers ultimately decided to leave Masters' fate [...] "ambiguous" [...] as they enjoyed working with Smith, with Fazekas saying, [...] "The nice thing about that is we could go both ways on it.

500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2008–09 season, Myrie-Williams was {{released}} by Bristol City. In June 2009, he joined Dundee United on a free transfer, signing a two-year deal with the Scottish Premier League club. Dundee United manager Craig Levein stated [...] "I am excited about the signing and I am sure he will develop into a real talent. Jennison is a player I've known about and admired for some time and up to about two years ago I would have said {{he was one of the}} brightest prospects in the country. He is a player who will not only excite the fans with his direct, quick running at defences, but he will also add pace to the team and strengthen <b>our</b> <b>options</b> going forward". Myrie-Williams made his Dundee United debut on 22 August 2009, coming on as an 88th-minute substitute in a 0–0 draw at St Mirren. He made a further two appearances as a late substitute, before starting his first game for Dundee United in the club's 2–0 away win against Ross County in the League Cup on 22 September 2009. He made his first league start on 17 October 2009, playing 84 minutes in a 1–1 home draw against Hamilton Academical, earning the 'Man of the Match' award for his performance. Myrie-Williams was again named as the 'Man of the Match' for his performance in a 2–1 win against Celtic at Tannadice on 22 November 2009— the club's website reported that he made [...] "the most creative impact during the game" [...] and that he [...] "continued his fine form of late and in doing so gave Celtic left back Danny Fox a torrid 90 minutes". He scored his first competitive goal for Dundee United in a 3–2 home win against St Mirren on 5 December 2009, scoring the club's third with a neat finish. He was on the scoresheet again in January 2010, scoring in a game against St Johnstone, Myrie-Williams' goal gave Dundee United the lead after trailing 2–0 at half-time, although the game ended 3–3. Myrie-Williams received the first red card of his career when he was sent-off for two bookable offences in the side's 2–0 home loss against Celtic on 25 April 2010. He played in the club's 2–0 win over Raith Rovers in the Scottish Cup semi-final, but was not selected for the Hampden Park final itself. He made 27 appearances for the [...] "Tangerines" [...] in his first season at the club, scoring twice.|$|E

40|$|This paper derives {{the pricing}} bounds of a {{currency}} cross-rate option using the option prices of two related dollar rates via a copula theory and presents the analytical {{properties of the}} bounds under the Gaussian framework. <b>Our</b> <b>option</b> pricing bounds are useful, because (1) they are general {{in the sense that}} they do not rely on the distribution assumptions of the state variables or on the selection of the copula function; (2) they are portfolios of the dollar-rate options and hence are potential hedging instruments for cross-rate options; and (3) they can be applied to generate bounds on deltas. The empirical tests suggest that there are persistent and stable relationships between the market prices and the estimated bounds of the cross-rate <b>options</b> and that <b>our</b> <b>option</b> pricing bounds (obtained from the market prices of options on two dollar rates) and the historical correlation of two dollar rates are highly informative for explaining the prices of the cross-rate options.

[...] She described her character as [...] "a weird girl [...] bright and very nerdy. She wears a lot of boot-cut corduroy pants and turquoise necklaces and looks like a hippie. I just like to pretend I'm Velma in Scooby-Doo." [...] Adam Rodriguez, Rory Cochrane, and Khandi Alexander were cast alongside Procter, completing the supporting ensemble. For the lead, CBS suggested David Caruso. Zuiker, who stated that he had [...] "heard about the NYPD Blue thing," [...] was initially hesitant. Elaborating, Zuiker stated that he [...] "sort of jumped in and said, 'Naw, I don't know about this guy. The show's tough enough to get off the ground and I don't want to walk into any problems." [...] CBS president Les Moonves had announced in January that a Miami spin-off was imminent, yet [...] "It wasn't until we sort of, like, at the eleventh hour, really started to look at <b>our</b> <b>options</b> as to who was going to play Horatio, [...] revisited Caruso.

The option value exhibits significant time variation that is correlated with periods of deflationary expectations. We use <b>our</b> estimated <b>option</b> values to construct an embedded option price index and an embedded option return index. We then use <b>our</b> embedded <b>option</b> indices as independent variables and examine their statistical and economic significance for explaining the future inflation rate. In most of our regressions, <b>our</b> embedded <b>option</b> return index is significant even in the presence of traditional inflation variables, such as the yield spread between nominal Treasuries and TIPS, the return on gold bullion, the VIX index return, and the lagged inflation rate. We conduct several robustness tests, including alternative weighting schemes, alternative variable specifications, and alternative data samples. We conclude that the embedded option in TIPS contains useful information for future inflation, both in-sample and out-of-sample. Our results should be valuable to practitioners, monetary authorities, and policymakers alike.
