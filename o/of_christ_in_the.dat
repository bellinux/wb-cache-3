5|$|The Act of Uniformity 1558, which forced {{people to}} attend Sunday service in an Anglican church {{with a new}} version of the Book of Common Prayer, passed by only three votes. The Bill of Uniformity was more {{cautious}} than the initial Reformation Bill. It revoked the harsh laws proposed against Roman Catholics, it removed the abuse of the pope from the litany and kept the wording that allowed for both consubstantial and transubstantial beliefs in the presence <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eucharist.|$|E
5|$|The Reformation {{spread to}} other parts of the Swiss Confederation, but several cantons resisted, preferring to remain Catholic. Zwingli formed an {{alliance}} of Reformed cantons which divided the Confederation along religious lines. In 1529, a war between the two sides was averted at the last moment. Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of Martin Luther and other reformers. They met at the Marburg Colloquy and although they agreed on many points of doctrine, they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the Real Presence <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eucharist.|$|E

5|$|In the Reformed confessions, the Lord's Supper is a {{meal that}} {{provides}} spiritual nourishment. Eating {{the body and}} drinking the blood <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sacrament is believed to spiritually strengthen Christians. Believers are already believed to be united with Christ, but the Supper serves to deepen and strengthen this union. The Supper is also a way to commemorate and proclaim the death and resurrection of Christ. Partakers are to express gratitude and praise to God in thanks for his death and the benefits it provides. The Supper is believed to assure Christians of their salvation and union with Christ, which has been communicated {{to them in the}} preaching of the gospel. The Supper is also believed to enhance Christians' union with one another. It calls Christians to love and obey Christ, and to live in harmony with other Christians.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli {{accepted}} Philip's invitation fully {{believing that}} {{he would be able to}} convince Luther. By contrast, Luther did not expect anything to come out of the meeting and had to be urged by Philip to attend. Zwingli, accompanied by Oecolampadius, arrived on 28 September 1529 with Luther and Philipp Melanchthon arriving shortly thereafter. Other theologians also participated including Martin Bucer, Andreas Osiander, Johannes Brenz, and Justus Jonas. The debates were held from 1–3 October and the results were published in the fifteen Marburg Articles. The participants were able to agree on fourteen of the articles, but the fifteenth article established the differences in their views on the presence <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eucharist. Afterwards, each side was convinced that they were the victors, but in fact the controversy was not resolved and the final result was the formation of two different Protestant confessions.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli {{arrived in}} Strasbourg in October 1553, {{where he was}} {{restored}} to his position at the Senior School and began lecturing on Judges as well as Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics. Vermigli often gathered with other Marian exiles for study and prayer in his home. His lectures on Judges often addressed the political issues relevant for the exiles, such {{as the right to}} resist a tyrant. Since Vermigli's departure and the death of Bucer in 1551, Lutheranism had gained influence in Strasbourg under the leadership of Johann Marbach. Vermigli had been asked to sign both the Augsburg Confession and the Wittenberg Concord as a condition of being reinstalled as professor. He was willing to sign the Augsburg Confession, but not the Concordat, which affirmed a bodily presence <b>of</b> <b>Christ</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Eucharist. He was retained and reappointed anyway, but controversy over the Eucharist as well as Vermigli's strong doctrine of double predestination continued with the Lutherans. Another professor in Strasbourg, Girolamo Zanchi, who had converted to Protestantism while under Vermigli in Lucca, shared Vermigli's convictions regarding the Eucharist and predestination. Zanchi and Vermigli became friends and allies. Vermigli's increasing alienation from the Lutheran establishment led him in 1556 to accept an offer from Heinrich Bullinger to teach at the Carolinum school in Zürich. John Jewel, a fellow Marian exile, came along with him.|$|E
