That these gruesome crimes have been committed on the eve of World Press Freedom Day – a day <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> honour the vital role played by journalists in upholding democratic values, protecting citizens’ rights to be informed and calling those in power to account – makes the situation all the more intolerable.

I saw it coming and ducked. And Steve just laughed." [...] McQueen had a knack with props, especially the weapons he used in the film. Hill remembered, [...] "You can see Steve's military training in his films. He was so brisk and confident in the way he handled the guns."

[...] Nguyen Thong, a former mandarin who fought alongside Định and corresponded with many other guerrilla leaders, agreed with the court records. According to Thong, Định's continued resistance resulted from local initiatives contrary to Huế's explicit instructions. Định's supporters implored him to disobey the edicts of 1862 that directed the partisans to end hostilities: [...] "Our people forced the Westerners to retreat many times, and now that the court has made peace with them, they will surely kill us....

500|$|Bartlett's {{decision}} to deposit stores {{on the ice}} ensured that an ice camp, known as [...] "Shipwreck Camp", {{was more or less}} established by the time Karluk sank. Two shelters had been built, one a snow igloo with a canvas roof, the other constructed from packing cases. To the latter was added a kitchen with a large stove rescued from Karluk's engine room. A small, separate shelter was built for the five Inuit, and a rough perimeter created from coal bags and assorted containers. In McKinlay's words, the camp provided [...] "substantial and comfortable houses <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> could rely for shelter for a long time." [...] Stores were plentiful, and the party was able to eat well. Much of the time in the first days of the camp was spent preparing and adjusting clothing and sleeping gear, in readiness for the forthcoming march to Wrangel Island. The ice drift was slowly moving the camp {{in the direction of the}} island, but as yet there was insufficient daylight to attempt the march.|$|E

[...] Paul Bloom and David Pizarro wrote in The Psychology of The Simpsons that although Lisa does show [...] "healthy religious skepticism" [...] she still believes in an eternal soul. However, Lisa tells Bart {{at the end of}} the episode, [...] "some philosophers believe that no one is born with a soul, you have to earn one through suffering". Bloom and Pizarro acknowledge: [...] "Indeed, some philosophers and theologians say that without belief in a soul, one cannot make sense of the social concepts <b>on</b> <b>which</b> <b>we</b> rely, such as personal responsibility and freedom of the will." ...|$|E
