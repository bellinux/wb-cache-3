500|$|Frank was not {{originally}} envisioned with a beard, however at {{the time}} of his casting, Fahey himself had one. Lindelof and Cuse felt that the beard worked with Lapidus' character, and allowed Fahey to keep it for the role, with the requirement he shave it back to a more manageable length. The character remained bearded until his return in fifth season episode [...] "316", set three years on from his original introduction. Fahey praised the way the character was developed to suit him, explaining that upon meeting with Lindelof and Cuse, rather than discussing the show with him, they were more interested in him personally and his experiences, going on to incorporate elements of himself into Lapidus. He expanded: [...] "The beauty of this is they'll feed you a concept based on an idea of who you are. The actor and the characters are not suits <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rack,</b> they tailor-make them to you. What's very exciting is it is a very positive give and take. It's a nice dance, as it were." [...] Fahey was not given an overarching overview of his character, nor were any of the other new freighter folk, which he found exciting, creating a level of intrigue amongst the cast and crew as well as fans. [...] Prior to arrival on the island, Lapidus was described by Naomi as a drunk. Entertainment Weeklys Kristin Dos Santos deemed Lapidus the most laid back of the four new characters, though Fahey commented that [...] "It might be because he's just rolled around a few more places a little longer than the others", agreeing with Dos Santos' assessment that Lapidus was [...] "a little nomadic". Lindelof and Cuse have said that Frank [...] "never takes anything at face value [...] a true conspiracy nut [...] has probably seen every episode of The X-Files, [...] pay off for him".|$|E

50|$|Security becomes {{far more}} reliant on human trust with loss of any layer. RuBee reduces that human trust {{reliance}} with full “process free” automation {{in all three}} layers. For example, if something is removed from inventory <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>racks,</b> but does not get checked out an alarm is issued. If an asset exits facility but is not checked out, an alarm is issued etc.RFID and barcode systems are blocked by steel and the human body. As a result, security is based on new human processes focused only on Layer 2. Both become human assisted asset tracking systems, not real-time automated security systems. Visible has repeatedly proven that RuBee is the wireless technology that can provide fully integrated, visibility with three security layer automation.|$|R

So galling and unremitting was the fire, that he at length wrote to Goldsmith, entreating him [...] "to take him <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>rack</b> of the newspapers"; in the meantime, to escape the laugh that was raised about him in the theatrical world of London, he took refuge in Bath during the triumphant career of the comedy.|$|E
50|$|The Vault of Horror is a mass-market {{paperback}} {{collection of}} eight horror comic stories {{gathered from the}} pages of the EC Comics comic books of the 1950s. It is one of five such collections published by Ballantine Books between 1964 and 1966 (the others are Tales from the Crypt, Tales of the Incredible, The Autumn People and Tomorrow Midnight). The presentation of the material is problematic at best, since the color comic book pages are represented in black and white and broken into horizontal strips to fit the mass-market paperback format. Still, the collections are historically important. They were the first attempt to resurrect the EC comics, only a decade after public outcry had driven them <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>racks.</b> They were <b>the</b> first introduction of those comics to a generation of readers too young to remember them in their first run.|$|R

Already in some factories girls are obliged to swim whether they like it or not, or do gymnastics whether they like it or not.

Daffy was not copper red like her sister, but really quite coarsely red-haired; she was bigger than Marjorie, and with irregular teeth instead of Marjorie's neat row; she confessed them in a broad simple smile of welcome. Theodore was hatless, rustily fuzzy-headed, and now a wealth of quasi-humorous gesture. The dog Toupee was straining at a leash, and doing its best in a yapping, confused manner, to welcome the wrong people by getting its lead round their legs.|$|E

50|$|The Autumn People is a mass-market {{paperback}} {{collection of}} comic adaptations of eight short horror and crime stories by Ray Bradbury, {{gathered from the}} pages of the EC Comics comic books of the 1950s.

50|$|Before {{becoming}} a professional wrestler, Patera {{was a highly}} decorated Olympic weightlifter. He won several medals at the 1971 Pan American Games (including gold in the weightlifting total), and {{finished second in the}} 1971 World Weightlifting Championships just behind Vasily Alekseyev. On his native soil, Patera won four consecutive U.S. Weightlifting Championships in the super heavyweight class from 1969 to 1972. He was the first American to clean and jerk over 500 lbs (227 kg), which he accomplished at the 1972 Senior Nationals in Detroit. He is also the only American to clean and press 500 lbs (227 kg), and was the last American super heavyweight for years to excel at weightlifting at an international level. At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, Patera was expected to be a serious competitor to Vasily Alekseyev, but he failed to total and was not among the medal recipients. Vasily Alekseyev even stated to the media that Patera was even stronger than him, illustrated by a 550-pound overhead push press (<b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>racks)</b> that Patera had allegedly done in practice. Nevertheless, when it came to competing, Alekseyev was always the winner. After the clean and press (a lift in which Patera was disproportionately talented) was eliminated from competition, Patera retired from weightlifting.|$|R

Piquet announced during practice for the 1987 Hungarian Grand Prix that he had signed with Lotus as the undisputed number 1 driver, a position he claimed was promised at Williams from 1986, but was never honored following Frank Williams' car crash. It was also believed this was a big factor in Honda dropping Williams and moving to McLaren for 1988, despite another year left in the contract. The Japanese, who paid most of Piquet's salary, considered him to be the number 1 and were privately fuming that Williams management didn't reign in Mansell and allow Piquet an easier time.|$|R

At the crime scene, Monk and Natalie meet detective #2, Cindy Chow and her psychologist Jasper Perry. Chow's paranoia clearly shows itself when she first is introduced to Monk. Natalie also develops a kinship with Jasper. Monk and Natalie enter the house and find that Allegra is more like a fashion model than an astrologer. Chow explains that someone came into the house last night and stabbed Allegra several times with a letter opener or ice pick. Monk goes into the bathroom and finds that someone broke <b>off</b> <b>the</b> towel <b>rack.</b> As he and Natalie leave the crime scene, he can't help but notice a lack of evidence pointing to forced entry. All that is certain is that Allegra knew the killer, judging from the lack of defensive wounds. They go and talk to Madam Frost, Allegra's elderly competitor just across the street. Frost talks like she didn't exactly like Allegra Doucet, and also says that Allegra was a fraud. Monk realizes that Frost has a motive for murdering her neighbor.|$|R
