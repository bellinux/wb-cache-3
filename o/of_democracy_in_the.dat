25|$|Another {{precondition}} {{for the rise}} <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Anglo-American world {{was the fact that}} Calvin favored a mixture of democracy and aristocracy as the best form of government (mixed government). He appreciated the advantages of democracy. The aim of his political thought was to safeguard the rights and freedoms of ordinary men and women. In order to minimize the misuse of political power he suggested dividing it among several institutions in a system of checks and balances (separation of powers). Finally, Calvin taught that if worldly rulers rise up against God they should be put down. In this way, he and his followers stood in the vanguard of resistance to political absolutism and furthered the cause of democracy. The Congregationalists who founded Plymouth Colony (1620) and Massachusetts Bay Colony (1628) were convinced that the democratic form of government was the will of God. Enjoying self-rule they practiced separation of powers. Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania, founded by Roger Williams, Thomas Hooker, and William Penn, respectively, combined democratic government with freedom of religion. These colonies became safe havens for persecuted religious minorities, including Jews.|$|E
500|$|Wilders' goal {{after he}} {{graduated}} from secondary school was to see the world.

With the money he saved, he travelled to the neighbouring Arab countries, and was moved by the lack <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> region, due to the conflicts at the time. When he returned to the Netherlands, he retained Israeli ideas about counter-terrorism and a [...] "special feeling of solidarity" [...] for the country.|$|E
500|$|However, the Government had {{maintained}} that the Pier and its tower was not {{old enough to be}} classified as [...] "historical" [...] and that people were not necessarily [...] "concerned about the building itself". To some extent, it was not wrong, since the activists were mainly fighting for the preservation of a public place and against the methods and urban planning policies of its government, perceived to favour business interests over the public interest. The struggle to preserve the Star Ferry and, later, the Queen's Pier, was the occasion to raise questions on Hong Kong's history, the question of colonialism, and that <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> HKSAR.|$|E

50|$|Substantive {{democracy}} is a form <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> outcome <b>of</b> elections is representative of <b>the</b> people. <b>In</b> other words, substantive {{democracy is}} a form <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> that functions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interest of the governed.

5000|$|<b>Democracy</b> is one <b>of</b> the propositions {{that many}} {{religious}} {{people are afraid}} of approaching.

500|$|In 272 words, {{and three}} minutes, Lincoln {{asserted}} {{the nation was}} born not in 1789, but in 1776, [...] "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition {{that all men are}} created equal". He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world would be assured, that [...] "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth".

500|$|Trotskyists regard {{themselves}} as working {{in opposition to}} both capitalism and Stalinism. Trotsky advocated proletarian revolution {{as set out in}} his theory of [...] "permanent revolution", and believed that a workers' state {{would not be able to}} hold out against the pressures of a hostile capitalist world unless socialist revolutions quickly took hold in other countries as well. This theory was advanced in opposition to the view held by the Stalinists that [...] "socialism in one country" [...] could be built in the Soviet Union alone. Furthermore, Trotsky and his supporters harshly criticised the increasingly totalitarian nature of Joseph Stalin's rule. They argued that socialism without democracy is impossible. Thus, faced with the increasing lack <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union, they concluded that it was no longer a socialist workers' state, but a degenerated workers' state.|$|E

Local Action, the group of rather young cultural and media activists which formed the core of the movement, were to later influence social movements, in Hong Kong as well as in the mainland: part of the more militant [...] "post 80s" [...] generation, they are critical of government business collusion, a one-sided development approach, Hong Kong's subordinate status within China and the perceived lack <b>of</b> <b>democracy</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> territory, and have been involved in the fight for real political reform in Hong Kong, and against the Express Rail link to Guangzhou.|$|E
