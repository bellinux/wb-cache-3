Furthermore, a {{policy is not}} Wednesbury-unreasonable if the court simply feels that it may not work effectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} Lemmings {{also has}} 20 two-player levels. This {{took advantage of}} the Amiga's ability to support two mice simultaneously, and the Atari's ability to support a mouse and a joystick simultaneously. Each player is presented with their <b>own</b> <b>view</b> of the same map (on a vertically split screen), can only give orders to their own lemmings (green or blue), and had their own base. The goal is to get more lemmings (regardless of colour) into one's own base than the other player. Gameplay cycles through the 20 levels until neither player gets any lemmings home.|$|E

He spends time with his sister’s human fiancée and visits the set of a film in which his brother stars. Jake is introduced to a human actress whom he finds attractive. As he reaches the end of his father’s diary, there is an entry detailing a time Jake was attacked by some human boys as a child. Jake, who had repressed the memory, discusses it with his mother. He learns the attack was stopped by members of ‘’Gallus Rex’’, an anti-human chicken group. Their actions colored Jake’s perception, and Elmer recorded his concerns about their effect on Jake in his diary.|$|E

25|$|Subsequent {{cases have}} focused {{attention}} {{on the fact that}} the view of the informed observer has sometimes become dangerously close to becoming the court's view.

Nazarene theologian A. M. Hills embraced the identical view when he discussed the Christian doctrine of creation in his 2-vol Fundamental Christian Theology. While neither believed in biological evolution, Winchester and Hills embraced cosmic and geological evolution without compunction.|$|E

In the end, Breton won the battle through tactical and numerical superiority. Though the quarrel over the anteriority of Surrealism concluded with the victory of Breton, the history of surrealism from that moment would remain marked by fractures, resignations, and resounding excommunications, with each surrealist having their <b>own</b> <b>view</b> of the issue and goals, and accepting more or less the definitions laid out by André Breton.|$|E

25|$|The {{objection}} although partially true {{is itself}} flawed. Strabo interjects his <b>own</b> <b>view</b> {{of the location}} of Celtica, that it was opposite to Britain, end to end. Pytheas, however, places it further south, around {{the mouth of the}} Loire (see above), from which it might justifiably be several days' sail. The people across from Britain in Caesar's time are the Germani in the north and the Belgae in the south. Still, some of the Celtic lands were on the channel and were visible from it, which Pytheas should have mentioned but Strabo implies he did not.|$|E
25|$|Kaplan’s <b>own</b> <b>view,</b> {{adopted by}} the GNYBA and {{subsequently}} by the American Contract Bridge League’s National Laws Commission, was that if a player takes an action {{that could have been}} influenced by unauthorized information, that action constitutes an offense, but not an offense that should necessarily be regarded as cheating. Instead, the incident should be handled as a procedural matter – much as accidentally exposing a card is treated as a technical violation, not as an attempt to cheat. In this way, bridge is able to apply sanctions such as score adjustment when a player allows himself to be inadvertently and subconsciously influenced by, say, his partner’s hesitation. It isn’t necessary to go to the extreme of accusing the player of deliberate cheating.|$|E
25|$|Rudin {{was written}} by Turgenev in the {{immediate}} aftermath of the Crimean War, when it became obvious to many educated Russians that reform was needed. The main debate of Turgenev's own generation was that of Slavophiles versus Westernizers. Rudin depicts a typical man of this generation (known as 'the men of forties'), intellectual but ineffective. This interpretation of the superfluous man as someone who possesses great intellectual ability and potential, but is unable to realize them stems from Turgenev’s <b>own</b> <b>view</b> of human nature, expressed in his 1860 speech ‘Hamlet and Don Quixote’, where he contrasts egotistical Hamlet, too deep in reflection to act, and enthusiastic and un-thinking, but active Don Quixote. The main character of the novel, Rudin, is easily identified with Hamlet.|$|E
