2500|$|As an example, at {{the surface}} plasmon {{resonance}} for a silver nanoparticle, the scattering cross-section is about 10x the cross-section of the nanoparticle. [...] The goal of the nano-particles is to trap light {{on the surface of}} the SC. [...] The absorption of light is not important for the nanoparticle, rather, it is important for the SC. [...] <b>One</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> if the nanoparticle is increased in size, then the scattering cross-section becomes larger. [...] This is true, however, when compared with the size of the nanoparticle, the ratio (...) is reduced. [...] Particles with a large scattering cross section tend to have a broader plasmon resonance range.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{theory that}} {{explains}} the rationale for odd pricing is prospect theory. This theory says that [...] "consumers facing uncertainty in decision making, base {{the value of an}} alternative on gains or losses offered by the alternative, relative to some reference point, rather than on final absolute states of wealth or welfare". This theory is {{based on the fact that}} losses mean more than gains. So based on that criterion, <b>one</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> something only a few cents under a whole dollar would actually be beneficial to the price. This theory works so well because of how the [...] "reference price" [...] is established by the consumer. The reference price for something that is $19.98 would be $20. This establishes the odd pricing as a better deal.|$|E
2500|$|Is {{it seriously}} contemplated, may I ask, to repress these aspirations, {{to hold this}} aggrieved and angry {{multitude}} down by force? Because – let us make no mistake - it will come {{to that in the}} end. This is not a mere denial of liberty; it is a case of taking away liberty which has been long enjoyed. That process, however disguised, is an act of spoliation dependent on force but force is not solvent of human problems. <b>One</b> <b>would</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> in South Africa there would be no need to press home that truth. And yet we are apt to forget, in dealing with this problem, that you cannot kill the soul of the people; and that the spirit of man will not tamely submit to the loss of rights which materially and spiritually he values. ...|$|E

Madame d'Angeville told me that she was drawn across a crevasse like this, by ropes tied under her arms, by the guides. The depth of some of the crevasses may be conjectured from the fact stated by Agassiz, that the thickest parts of the glaciers are over one thousand feet in depth.|$|R
