5|$|A {{legal issue}} must be {{justiciable}} before the High Court will grant an applicant leave {{to apply for}} judicial review. Justiciability recognizes the limited capabilities of the courts.

The doctrine is based on an understanding of the separation of powers and the need to find the right constitutional balance between the courts and the executive. For example, matters <b>of</b> <b>policy</b> or subjective preference, and polycentric public policy issues, are better left in the hands of an elected body of persons.|$|E
