40|$|Background: Testicular adrenal rest tumours (TARTs) are benign {{testicular}} masses {{that are}} found in inadequately treated patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Recognizing this association and identifying characteristic ultrasound features of TARTs is important {{so as to avoid}} misdiagnosing them as malignancies, which can lead to unnecessary interventions. Case Report: We describe a case of a 9 -year-old boy, with a diagnosis of CAH and precocious puberty, who was referred to our department for an ultrasound evaluation of the abdomen and scrotum. On ultrasound, there were well-defined, heterogeneous, predominantly hypoechoic, round-to-oval masses in both testes. Taking into account the presence of CAH and a typical sonographic appearance of bilateral testicular masses, a diagnosis of testicular adrenal rest tumour was made; biopsy was deferred and hormonal treatment was modified. Conclusions: Prompt diagnosis of testicular adrenal rest tumours is essential, as it only indicates inadequate hormonal control. Moreover, it can prevent unnecessary biopsies and <b>orchidectomies,</b> and can maintain fertility. TARTs have a typical imaging appearance that every radiologist must be aware of...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} prevalence, onset, {{duration}} {{and severity of}} hot flashes in men after bilateral <b>orchidectomies</b> (BO) for prostate cancer, to evaluate body temperature changes during hot flashes and to determine whether an elevated temperature {{within a few days}} after BO can be caused by deprivation of androgen. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients (n = 101) were questioned about the characteristics of their hot flashes after BO for prostate cancer. A subgroup of these men (n = 17) were instructed to record their oral and forehead temperatures during and at fixed intervals between hot flashes daily for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The mean age was 71. 6 years, mean follow-up after BO was 33. 2 months. Hot flashes were reported by 87 men (86 %) with previous spontaneous remission in 9 (10 %). The median time between BO and the onset of hot flashes was 21 days (range 1 - 730), median number of hot flashes 3 per day (range 1 - 20), and median duration was 120 seconds (range 5 to 1800). There {{was no significant difference between}} median oral (36. 4 º C) and forehead (36. 0 º C) temperature in the normal state, but during hot flashes the median forehead temperature (37. 0 º C) was higher than the oral temperature (36. 5 º C) (p = 0. 0004).

[...] In June 1931, when Dora Richter/Dörchen R. was about 40 years old, her penis was amputated by the Institute physician Dr. Levy-Lenz, and then an artificial vagina was surgically grafted by the Berlin surgeon Prof. Dr. Gohrbandt. Dora becomes the first trans woman of whom records remain to undergo vaginoplasty. According to Dr. Felix Abraham, a psychiatrist working at the Institute for Sexual Science, her [...] "first step to feminization was made by means of castration" [...] in 1922. [...] "After this there was a long pause, until {{the beginning of the year}} 1931, when the penis amputation was done and in June, the here described surgery" [...] - a highly experimental vaginoplasty performed by Dr. Erwin Gohrbandt, (1890-1965). The highly experimental operation (which included the first attempt at vaginoplasty) was a remarkable success and the resulting publicity was enough to lure Lili to the Institute. Lili's case was far more high-profile that Dorchen's. Lili became the second trans woman to undergo Gohrbandt's vaginoplasty technique in 1931. Her castration and penectomy had been performed by Dr. Ludwig Levy-Lenz (1889-1966) the previous year. These preliminaries have sometimes caused confusion over the date of Lili's reassignment surgery. Gohrbandt's surgery deliberately leaves remnants of the scrotum intact, with a view to modifying these into labia at a later date, but, for reasons that are unclear, he did not perform this further procedure himself. Instead, Elvenes' case was taken over by the Nazi Party member Dr. Kurt Warnekros (1882-1949) at the Dresden Women's Clinic. Here, the labiaplasty and a subsequent surgical revision led to Lili's death from infection in September 1931. The ritual book-burning at the Institute for Sexual Science by Nazi students in May 1933 and the destruction of the Dresden Women's Clinic and its records in the Allied bombing raids of February 1945 has left gaps in knowledge of the life of Lili Elbe.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>orchidectomy</b> on the {{structure}} and function of lymphoid tissues in mice have been studied. Both pre- and postpuberal <b>orchidectomy</b> caused relative hypertrophy of the thymus. There was also an increase in size of peripheral lymph nodes to reach a sustained maximum (6 weeks). Sychronous thymectomy and <b>orchidectomy</b> prevented the lymph node enlargement that follows <b>orchidectomy</b> alone.

The reactivity of orchidectomized mice to sheep red blood cells and the early response to oxazolone, which is limited by thymus-processed cells, was increased, whereas production of antibodies to oxazolone, skin allografts, and pneumococcal polysaccharide was unchanged. It is suggested that <b>orchidectomy</b> increases cell-mediated immune responses but has no direct effect upon responses that are mainly dependent on B cells. <b>Orchidectomy</b> prolongs the interval between the subcutaneous injection of methylcholanthrene and the appearance of subcutaneous sarcomas.

Results: of the 60 <b>orchidectomy</b> specimens after chemotherapy, 24 (40 %) contained significant histological abnormalities comprising residual invasive germ cell cancer, intratubular germ cell neoplasia and/or mature teratoma.
