500|$|According to Usher [...] "Love You Gently", a piano-based classic {{rhythm and}} blues ballad, is [...] "the one [...] you throw <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> {{significant}} other when it's {{time to get to}} it. This is why my son's here. It's a baby-maker." [...] Jay-Z appears on the horn-founded [...] "Best Thing", which is about transition to manhood. Usher outlines lifestyle changes since his wife's arrival and turns away from his days as [...] "a hustler and a player" [...] in [...] "Before I Met You", which makes use of guitar and heavy drums. He is suspected of infidelity and compared to his girlfriend's cheating ex-partner on [...] "His Mistakes". The thirteenth track on Here I Stand is [...] "Appetite", which utilizes flutes and has Usher tempted to cheat on his wife. [...] "What's a Man to Do" [...] opens with a Native Indian call, while [...] "Lifetime" [...] contains influences of 1990s R [...] "Love in This Club Part II" [...] features vocals from Beyoncé Knowles and Lil Wayne and samples The Stylistics' [...] "You Are Everything" [...] (1971); its lyrical content {{is similar to that of}} Part I, and Wayne's voice is modified through the use of a vocoder. The album's soul and pop jazz-derived title track, [...] "Here I Stand", drew comparisons to Stevie Wonder. With a theme of commitment, it was played at Usher's and Foster's wedding. Here I Stand closes with [...] "Will Work for Love", although it was placed as a hidden track on some copies; Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called it [...] "cute".|$|E

"Go <b>on</b> <b>with</b> <b>your</b> {{efforts to}} bring about the {{earliest}} possible participation of Japan in the war against Russia…The natural goal must be, as before, {{to bring about the}} meeting of Germany and Japan on the Trans-Siberian Railroad before winter sets in. With the collapse of Russia, the position of the Tripartite Powers in the world will be so gigantic that the question of the collapse of England, that is, the absolute annihilation of the British Isles, will only be a question of time. An America completely isolated {{from the rest of the}} world would then be faced with the seizure of those of the remaining positions of the British Empire important to the Tripartite Powers".As part of his {{efforts to bring}} Japan into Barbarossa, on 1 July 1941, Ribbentrop had Germany break off diplomatic relations with Chiang Kai-shek and recognized the Japanese-puppet government of Wang Jingwei as China's legitimate rulers. Ribbentrop hoped that recognizing Wang would be seen as a coup that might add to the prestige of the pro-German Japanese Foreign Minister Yōsuke Matsuoka, who was opposed to opening American-Japanese talks. Despite Ribbentrop's best efforts, Matsuoka was sacked as foreign minister later in July 1941, and the Japanese-American talks began.|$|E
