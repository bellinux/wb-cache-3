40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to verify the ability of of modern game device such a Microsoft Kinect sensor for examinations in <b>otoneurology.</b> One of the traditional tests - Hautant’s test, was selected and its implementation based on Microsoft Kinect skeleton tracking feature will be presented. Hautant’s test has been programmed for laboratory experiments and the results are discussed and tested in cooperation with specialists in <b>otoneurology.</b> However, <b>otoneurology</b> has several other tests that are based on spontaneous or artificial unbalance human movement tracking. The combination of Kinect sensor and future software application therefore appear to be further applicable with possible benefits in practice. Using gaming equipment can also greatly accelerate the development. The research does not need to focus on the hardware development and the efforts may be directed to the implementation of the particular task. The objectives and results may be earlier deployed for practical tests and use. The price of the hardware, which is produced in the millions series for gaming devices is of course much lower than the equipment developed specifically for particular medicine examination.

Posturography (PG) is applied in <b>otoneurology</b> as an examination technique for evaluation of the in-fluence of the vestibulospinal reflex (VSR) on bal-ance in the erect (standing) position. 14 Standing is achieved by a process of active body movements around the point of gravity, called postural sway. ’-’ This sway is the phenomenon recorded and mea...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The human {{postural}} {{control system}} {{is complex and}} it combines information from different sources. The most important information comes from vestibular, visual and proprioceptive senses. We studied the effects of removing the visual and proprioceptive information simultaneously. The force feedback from the ground was removed with vibrators attached on the musculus soleus of both calves. By using features of force platform signals, when the vibrators were on, the lengths of the swaying paths were four times the lengths when the vibrators were off. Our results show {{that it is possible}} to separate the effects of the visual and proprioceptive senses from that of vestibular sense, which is very useful for investigations of balance problems in <b>otoneurology.</b> This supports our future aim to classify between healthy subjects and different otoneurological patients with signal analysis and pattern recognition methods to be used for force platform signals...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we have tried}} to explain and to {{substantiate}} the physiopathological basis of a new method of treatment for vertigo. In accordance with experimental and clinical evidence, we have based it upon the principle of habituation, which favours the development of what is well-known in <b>Otoneurology</b> as 'central vestibular compensation'. The habituation effect, with pattern building and rebuilding, when applied to the functional sequelase of a labyrinthine lesions, can explain how a new, central regulation of balance can be rebuilt in spite of the persistence of peripheral dysfunction. Habituation is developed by repeating a specific mode of stimulation, but only for the effect of this particular stimulation. Our treatment, based upon the principle of habituation, consists in repeating those movements (or components of movements) which provoke dizziness. Habituation will be stimulated and the information pattern elicited during these movements evolves from 'unadapted' and 'unknown' to 'normal'. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Background and aims: Balance {{disorder}} is oneof {{the most common}} health problems (Perez etal., 2003). A huge amount of scientific literaturedescribes the coexistence of a significant linkbetween vestibular and psychiatric disorders(Monzani et al, 2006) and its neurobiologicbackground (Balanban et al., 2001). We aim todescribe the relationship between otoneurologyand psychiatry. Methods: We considered two conditions: 1 -where anxiety has a predominant role inoriginating vestibular symptoms such as phobicpostural vertigo (Brandt, 1996), space andmotion discomfort, dizziness andlightheadedness in panic attacks (Furman andJacob, 2001); 2 -when pre-existing vestibulardysfunction is worsened by anxiety symptoms,increasing vestibulo-oculo-motor reflex gain(Yardley et al, 1995) and reducing adaptationmechanisms in visuo-vestibular conflicts(Viaud-Delmon et al., 2000).

40|$|International audiencePurpose of reviewThe review {{presents}} {{a selection of}} recent studies {{in the field of}} vestibular neuroscience, including how vestibular stimulation modulates space and body perception. Recent findingsRecent neuroimaging studies identified the operculo-insular/retroinsular cortex as the core vestibular cortex and showed how it is reorganized after vestibular dysfunctions. Subliminal galvanic vestibular stimulation (GVS) induces long-term reduction of hemispatial neglect and improves vertical perception in stroke patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain to be identified. Healthy volunteer research suggests that GVS and caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS) modulate visual and somatosensory processing and that beneficial effects of GVS/CVS in stroke patients are not limited to merely rebalancing brain hemispheric activity. Another mechanism would be that GVS/CVS anchors the self to the body, thus promoting an egocentric frame of reference. SummaryIn addition to balancing the body', the vestibular cortical network contributes to modulate space, body and self-awareness. Emerging evidence suggests that the vestibular network expands into dimensions of emotion processing, mental health, and social cognition. Here, the importance of connecting vestibular physiology, affective neuroscience, and social neuroscience to better understand the psychological aspects of vertigo in <b>otoneurology</b> is discussed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess the impact of {{adequate}} treatment of concomitant diseases in the elderly undergoing Vestibular Rehabilitation (VR). Method: 52 elderly patients with complaints of vertigo and/or imbalance requiring VR participated in this prospective study. The trial was designed as an open clinical assay at the Ear Nose and Throat Department Geriatric <b>Otoneurology</b> Clinic, and was done between 2003 and 2005. Patients were compared with the total group of elderly individuals treated with VR during the same period. Results: 65 diseases were diagnosed in the study group, an average 1. 25 diseases per patient. After the treatment of these diseases, patients underwent VR. The effectiveness of VR (remission and partial improvement rates) was 84. 5 % in the study group against 81. 8 % in the control group, which was not significant. Remission of symptoms, however, was present in 69. 2 % of the study group against 43. 18 % of the control group, which was statistically significant.

40|$|The {{issue of}} the cochleovestibular {{disorders}} is part of <b>otoneurology.</b> The scope of the etiopathogenesis of these lesions is wide. The examination of an otoneurological profile using the cochleovestibular diagnostic tests and imaging techniques can distinguish an organic lesion - mostly a vestibular schwannoma - from idiopathic lesions. The treatment of idiopathic and organic lesions is vastly different. The return to the original state takes precedence {{in the treatment of}} idiopathic sensorineural hearing impairment. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy plays an important role. This, however, is not the case with a vestibular schwannoma. The removal of a tumor or its radiosurgical treatment to stop its growth is given priority. Observation of tumor growth is an independent method. Preservation of hearing in the state as before the treatment is considered a success. Revealing the etiology of hearing impairment by means of examining a patient's otoneurological profile determines totally different medical procedures and diverse outcomes of the treatments for idiopathic and organic lesions, and this is what the thesis is focusing on. The introductory chapters give an overview of the current knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the vestibular apparatus in relation to an otoneurological profile. This is [...] ...|$|E

Material and MethodWe studied a group of normal individuals (n = 15) and a Studied group (n = 15) that comprised patients with diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Both groups were submitted to vestibular evoked myogenic potential exam. In each ear it was applied 200 stimuli by clicks and repeated for 2 consecutive cycles {{with the purpose of}} evaluating reproducibility. The active electrode of surface was put on the superior S‡of sternocleidomastoid muscle and the reference electrode on the anterior border of the clavicle. The individuals were instructed to rotate theirs head to the opposite side to the stimulated ear. ResultsVestibular evoked myogenic potential responses were prompt, reproducible and biphasic. The latency of wave P 1 and N 2 and P 1 -N 2 amplitude showed a higher value in the studied group when compared with the normal group. There was no significant difference when the ears were compared in P 1 and N 2 amplitude. We noticed that individuals with multiple sclerosis showed no response in 30 % of the cases. In evaluating the individuals of the Studied group with <b>otoneurology</b> symptoms and compared with individuals without symptoms, it was observed that P 1 and N 2 latencies and P 1 -N 2 amplitude were higher in symptomatic cases.

Objective: Analyze and correlate the different signs and otoneurological symptoms, the audiological findings and its incidence over individuals with Vascular Loop (VL) diagnosis of VIII cranial nerves by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Method: Retrospective study through the analysis of medical records of 47 patients attended in the <b>otoneurology</b> clinic of Clinical Hospital of UFPR. All the patients have MRI exams with compatible pictures of VL of the VIII cranial nerves. Results: The tinnitus was the most frequent symptom, in 83 % of the patients, followed by hypoacusis (60 %) and vertigo (36 %). The audiometry presented alterations in 89 %, the brainstem evoked auditory potential in 33 % and the vecto-electronystagmography in 17 % of the patients.

40|$|Objective: Primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to find a statistical link between the most worldwide comorbidities affecting the elderly population (hypertension, diabetes, osteoarthrosis, osteoporosis and depression) and recurrent episodes of BPPV. Secondary objective was defining possible groups of risk for people suffering recurrent positional vertigo related to the presence of a well documented comorbidity. Methods: This was an observational, cross-sectional, multicenter, spontaneous, non-pharmacological study. the data of 1092 patients suffering BPPV evaluated in 11 different Departments of Otolaryngology, <b>Otoneurology</b> and Neurology, referring Centers for positional vertigo evaluation, were retrospectively-collected. Results: Regarding evaluated comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, osteoarthrosis, osteoporosis and depression), data analysis showed the presence of at least one comorbid disorder in 216 subjects (19. 8 %) and 2 or more in 408 subjects (37. 4 %). Moreover there was a statistical significant difference between the number of comorbidities and the number of recurrences, otherwise said as comorbidity disorders increased the number of relapses increased too. Conclusion: the presence of a systemic disease may worsen the status of the posterior labyrinth causing a more frequent otolith detachment. This condition increases the risk for patients suffering BPPV to have recurrent episodes, even if correctly managed by repositioning maneuvers. the combination of two or more of aforementioned comorbidities further increases the risk of relapsing BPPV, worsened by the presence of osteoporosis. On the basis of this results it was possible to define groups of risk useful for predicting BPPV recurrence in patients with one or more comorbidity. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Ambos os grupos foram submetidos ao exame de potencial evocado miogênico vestibular. Em cada orelha foram aplicados 200 estímulos na forma de cliques e repetidos por 2 ciclos consecutivos com objetivo de avaliar a reprodutibilidade. Os eletrodos ativos de superfície foram colocados no S‡superior do músculo esternocleidomastoideo e de referência na borda anterior da clavícula ipsilateral. Os indivíduos foram instruídos à rotação lateral da cabeça em direção contralateral à orelha estimulada. RESULTADOS: Obtivemos no potencial evocado miogênico vestibular respostas rápidas, reprodutíveis e bifásicas. A latência das ondas P 1 e N 2 e amplitude P 1 -N 2 apresentaram um maior valor no grupo experimental quando comparada com o grupo-controle. Não observamos diferença significativa nas respostas das ondas P 1 e N 2 e amplitude P 1 -N 2 quando comparamos as orelhas. Verificamos que os indivíduos com esclerose múltipla apresentaram ausência de respostas em 30 % dos casos. Ao avaliarmos os indivíduos do grupo experimental com sintomas otoneurológicos e compararmos com os pacientes sem sintomas, observamos que a latência da onda P 1, N 2 e amplitude P 1 -N 2 estiveram maiores nos casos sintomáticos. CONCLUSÃO: O potencial evocado miogênico vestibular foi considerado um bom método de auxílio diagnóstico da via vestíbulo-espinal nos casos de esclerose múltipla. AIM: To evaluate vestibular evoked myogenic potentials {{in patients}} with multiple sclerosis as method of diagnostic support. STUDY DESIGN: Case-control. MATERIAL AND METHOD: We studied a group of normal individuals (n= 15) and a Studied group (n= 15) that comprised patients with diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. Both groups were submitted to vestibular evoked myogenic potential exam. In each ear it was applied 200 stimuli by clicks and repeated for 2 consecutive cycles {{with the purpose of}} evaluating reproducibility. The active electrode of surface was put on the superior S‡of sternocleidomastoid muscle and the reference electrode on the anterior border of the clavicle. The individuals were instructed to rotate theirs head to the opposite side to the stimulated ear. RESULTS: Vestibular evoked myogenic potential responses were prompt, reproducible and biphasic. The latency of wave P 1 and N 2 and P 1 -N 2 amplitude showed a higher value in the studied group when compared with the normal group. There was no significant difference when the ears were compared in P 1 and N 2 amplitude. We noticed that individuals with multiple sclerosis showed no response in 30 % of the cases. In evaluating the individuals of the Studied group with <b>otoneurology</b> symptoms and compared with individuals without symptoms, it was observed that P 1 and N 2 latencies and P 1 -N 2 amplitude were higher in symptomatic cases. CONCLUSION: Vestibular evoked myogenic potential was considered a good method of diagnostic support of vestibulospinal tract in cases of multiple sclerosis...|$|E
40|$|Rationale: Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) {{dysfunction}} and occlusion abnormalities {{can cause}} cochlear and vestibular disorders. This issue {{is at the}} crossroads of several disciplines: <b>otoneurology,</b> physiotherapy, dentistry, medical rehabilitation and posturology, which often makes it difficult to timely diagnose them and delays the onset of treatment. Aim: To assess the role of abnormal dental occlusion and TMJ disorders in the pathophysiology and clinical manifestation of cochleovestibular syndrome. Materials and methods: We examined 300 subjects with clinical signs of cochleovestibular syndrome, asymmetry of occlusion and/or TMJ dysfunction (the main group), 55 patients with signs of TMJ structural and functional disorders and occlusal disorders without a cochleovestibular syndrome (the reference group), and 35 healthy volunteers (the control group). All patients were examined by a neurologist, an ENT specialist, a dentist and a physiotherapist. A series of additional investigations of the brachiocephalic vessels, cervical spine, TMJ, auditory and vestibular function, premature tooth contacts were performed. Results: The main group patients had high values of TMJ dysfunction in the Hamburg test (5. 85 vs 2. 2 in the reference group) and higher proportions of patients with moderate and severe TMJ dysfunction (n = 243, 81 % and n = 13, 23. 7 %, respectively). The functional muscle test parameters and the results of manual muscle testing in the main group patients were significantly different from those in the control group (р 0. 05). Patients with cochleoves-tibular syndrome had 2 to 3 -fold higher rates of vertebrogenic dysfunctions than those from the reference group. The video nystamography technique detected the positional cervical nystagmus in 100 % (n = 300) of patients from the main group, whereas there were no nystagmus in those from the reference group. Voluntary dental occlusion in the main group patients was associated with a deterioration of postural tests in 61. 8 % (n = 185) of patients; in the reference group patients these parameters deteriorated in 38. 2 % (n = 21) of cases. According to T-SCAN assessment, 300 (100 %) patients from the main group had in imbalance of total distribution of the occlusion force (р < 0. 05 compared to the control group). The biggest number of patients from the main group (73. 7 %, n = 221) had an imbalance of occlusion force within 20 to 40 %, and in most patients from the reference group this parameter was in the range of 10 to 30 % (85. 5 %, n = 47), with 14. 5 % (n = 8) of this group having a normal balance of the occlusion force. Cerebrovascular reactivity parameters measured by ultrasound Doppler technique demonstrated a moderately significant (р < 0. 05) strain of the cerebral hemodynamic reserve in the posterior arterial system in patients with cochleovestibular syndrome. Conclusion: Cochleovestibular disorders can be caused by a dysfunction of the dentoman-dibular system and/or cervical / masticatory myofascial syndrome. After exclusion of any otogenic pathology in patients with cochleovestibular syndrome, their neurological examination should include a visual assessment of the occlusion and mandibular movements, as well as testing of the cervical and masticatory muscles. If any abnormalities of occlusion and/or TMJ and local muscle dysfunction are revealed, then a dentist and a physiotherapist consultation should be performed. </p...|$|E
