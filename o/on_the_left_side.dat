5|$|The Anfield Road stand, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the Main Stand, {{houses the}} away fans during matches.

5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the chassis, {{from top to}} bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated airspeed, course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of airspeed. A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Final Fantasy is menu-based: {{the player}} selects an action {{from a list}} of options such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Battles are turn-based and {{continue}} until either side flees or is defeated. If the player's party wins, each character will gain experience and Gil; if it flees, it will be returned to the map screen; and if every character in the party dies, the game will be over and all unsaved progress will be lost. Final Fantasy was the first game to show the player's characters {{on the right side of}} the screen and the enemies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> of the screen, as opposed to a first-person view.|$|E
