5|$|A postwar {{review of}} {{inadequate}} housing {{led to the}} clearance and redevelopment of {{large areas of the}} city in a postwar style, often at variance with the Georgian style of the city.

5|$|A {{report by}} Rundstedt to Hitler in October 1943 {{regarding}} the weak defences in France {{led to the}} appointment of Rommel to oversee the construction <b>of</b> <b>further</b> fortifications along the expected invasion-front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg. Rommel was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands. Nazi Germany's tangled command structure {{made it difficult for}} Rommel to achieve his task. He was not allowed to give orders to the Organisation Todt, which was commanded by armaments minister Albert Speer, so in some places he had to assign soldiers to do construction work.|$|E
5|$|A. macrodactylum is {{a member}} of the Ambystomatidae, also known as the mole salamanders. The Ambystomatidae {{originated}} approximately 81 million years ago (late Cretaceous) from its sister taxon Dicamptodontidae. The Ambystomatidae are also members of suborder Salamandroidea, which includes all the salamanders capable of internal fertilization. The sister species to A.macrodactylum is A. laterale, distributed in eastern North America. However, the species-level phylogeny for Ambystomatidae is tentative and in need <b>of</b> <b>further</b> testing.|$|E

5|$|After the Venice 1640–41 revival {{there is}} no record <b>of</b> <b>further</b> {{performances}} of Il ritorno in Venice, or elsewhere, before the discovery of the music manuscript in the 19th century. The discovery of this manuscript in Vienna suggests that at some time the opera was staged there, or at least contemplated, perhaps before the Imperial court. The Monteverdi scholar Alan Curtis dates the manuscript's arrival in Vienna to 1675, during the reign of the Emperor LeopoldI who was a considerable patron of the arts, and opera in particular.|$|E

Cankili, along with every surviving member of the royal family, was captured and taken to Goa, where he was hanged. The remaining captives were asked to become monks or nuns in the holy orders, and as most obliged, their celibacy avoided the production <b>of</b> <b>further</b> claimants to the Jaffna throne.|$|E
