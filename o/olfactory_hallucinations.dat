25|$|Although all {{individuals}} with ORS {{believe they have}} an odor, {{in some cases the}} individual reports they cannot perceive the odor themselves. In the latter cases, the belief arises via misinterpretation of the behavior of others or with the rationale that a disorder of smell which prevents self detection of the odor (i.e. anosmia) exists. In the cases where the non-existent odor can be detected, this is usually considered as phantosmia (<b>olfactory</b> <b>hallucination).</b> <b>Olfactory</b> <b>hallucination</b> can be considered the result of the belief in an odor delusion, or the belief a result of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>hallucination.</b> In one review, the individual with ORS was unreservedly convinced that he or she could detect the odor themselves in 22% of cases, whilst in 19% there was occasional or intermittent detection and in 59% lack of self-detection was present.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} pattern of {{clinical}} presentation of partial epilepsy among Sudanese epileptic patients attending Elshaab Teaching Hospital from May 2005 to March 2006. Introduction: Seizures are categorized as partial (with the initial activation of {{a limited number of}} neurons in a part of one hemisphere) or generalized (with the initial activation of neurons throughout both hemispheres). Setting: The study was conducted at Elshaab Teaching Hospital Duration: May 2005 – March 2006. Design: Fifty patients with partial were included in a prospective cross- sectional hospital-based-study. Results: The mean age is 35. 96 years. Male to female ratio was 1. 4 : 1. Abdominal aura predominates in 12 %, followed by autonomic symptoms in 8 %, fear in 6 %, anxiety and visual hallucination in 4 %, <b>olfactory</b> <b>hallucination,</b> auditory hallucination and automatism in 2 %. Postictal confusion was found in 16 % followed by post ictal sleep and Todd’s paralysis in 8 %, headache in 6 % and amnesia in 4 %. Abnormal neurological signs found in 30 %. Space occupying lesions in 22 % and cerebrovascular accident in 20 % are the commonest causes for partial epilepsy, followed by brain atrophy in 6 %, and arterioveneous malformation in 2 % as detected by MRI. EEG was found abnormal in 56 % i. e. 42 % focal discharge, 10 % focal discharge with secondary generalization and 4 % generalized discharge. Conclusion: Prodromal symptoms like abdominal pain nausea and vomiting were the commonest symptoms in partial epilepsy.

40|$|The {{study is}} talking about Hallucination. The problem {{of this study is}} how {{hallucination}} reflected in Henry James’ The Turn of The Screw. It uses psychological and sociological perspectives. Psychologically, the objectives of this study are presenting an analysis of the symptoms, the causes and effects of hallucination experienced by the governess. Besides, it also analyzes the sociological factor that describes the relationship of Henry James’ The Turn of The Screw and social reality of English society at the end of 19 th century; and to reveal the author’s criticism at Henry James’ The Turn of The Screw. The object of this study is Henry James’ The Turn of The Screw novel. This research employs a qualitative approach that has two types of data sources, namely primary and secondary data. The primary data source is the novel and the secondary data is other material related to the study. Both data are collected through library research and analyzed by descriptive analysis. The findings of the research based on the psychological analysis reveal the symptoms of hallucination experienced by the governess which are feeling anxious, seeing the apparitions, hearing some voices, feeling afraid, day dreaming, screaming, and talking to oneself, and the types of hallucination experienced by the governess which are auditory <b>hallucination,</b> visual <b>hallucination,</b> <b>olfactory</b> <b>hallucination</b> and mood-incongruent hallucination. The causes of hallucination experienced are her poverty, her low education, her too much responsibility, her repressed and unfulfilled sexual desire. And the effects of hallucination found are the governess insanity and over protective to the children. In addition, based on the sociological analysis, it is apparent that there is a strong relation between this novel and the social reality in England in the 19 th century. And, the author criticizes about unequal social status and gender. The findings of this research are expected to give a wider horizon about hallucination, and also can add and enrich the knowledge about literature product.

50|$|Interneurons in the {{external}} plexiform layer are responsive to pre-synaptic action potentials and exhibit both excitatory postsynaptic potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Neural firing varies temporally, there are periods of fast, spontaneous firing and slow modulation of firing.

5000|$|There {{are a few}} {{causes for}} phantosmia, {{but one of the}} most common and {{well-documented}} involves brain injury or seizures in the temporal lobe. During a temporal lobe seizure the victim rarely faints, but usually blacks out and cannot remember anything that happened during the seizure. Several people who have had these seizures did, however, recollect having phantosmia just prior to blacking out. Epilepsy is a disease characterized by seizures. In the case of phantosmia, if smelling and something else become so strongly linked, the action of [...] "something else" [...] occurring can induce activation of the olfactory bulb even though there was no stimulus for the bulb present.

5000|$|A person {{experiencing}} a TEA episode {{has very little}} short-term memory, {{so that there is}} profound difficulty remembering events in the past few minutes (anterograde amnesia), or of events in the hours prior to the onset of the attack, and even memories of important events in recent years may not be accessible during the amnestic event (retrograde amnesia). Some people report short-lived retrograde amnesia so deep that they do not recognize their home or family members, though personal identity is preserved. The amnestic attack has a sudden onset. Three-fourths of cases are reported upon awakening. In attacks that begin when an individual is fully alert, <b>olfactory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> or a [...] "strange taste" [...] or nausea have been reported. Somewhat less than half the cases include olfactory or gustatory hallucinations, and slightly more than a third involve motor automatisms. A quarter of attacks involve a brief period of unresponsiveness. Frequently, however, there is no warning.|$|E
50|$|The {{major issues}} are {{summarized}} on the TIME website:The cluster of memory problems occurring {{in patients with}} TEA - episodes of transient amnesia, accelerated forgetting and autobiographical amnesia - challenges both standard and multiple trace models of memory. The features of the amnesic episodes, the high frequency of <b>olfactory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> during attacks and findings from electroencephalography suggest that a medial temporal lobe focus {{is responsible for the}} seizures. On the 'standard model' of memory consolidation, which proposes that the medial temporal lobes play a time-limited role in memory processing, accelerated forgetting, occurring over days-1 week (TIME data), is a plausible result of structural or functional pathology in the medial temporal lobes. The associated autobiographical memory impairment is, however, a more puzzling consequence of medial temporal lobe pathology on this theory. It could be that epileptiform activity originating in the medial temporal lobe has the potential to disrupt the distributed neocortical traces required to maintain detailed autobiographical memories. Multiple trace theory, on the other hand predicts that disturbances of anterograde and retrograde episodic memory will go hand in hand. However it is not evident, in this theory, that partial damage to the hippocampus - of the kind that might plausibly cause of the phenomena of TEA - should lead to selective erasure of previously salient autobiographical memories. Thus neither of the leading current models of retrograde memory readily accounts for our observations.|$|E
50|$|Hallucinations of {{pain and}} touch are very rare in {{schizophrenic}} disorders but 20% of patients with schizophrenia experience some sort of tactile hallucinations along with visual and auditory hallucinations. The most common tactile hallucination in patients with schizophrenia is a sensation in which a patch of their skin is stretched elastically across their head. They vary in intensity, range and speed at which they feel this stretching painful sensation. They are usually triggered by emotional cues such as guilt, anger, fear and depression. Other types of tactile hallucinations takes on a sexual form in patients with schizophrenia. Patients with schizophrenia may sometimes experience {{the feeling of being}} kissed or the feeling of someone lying by their side in response to their emotion of being lonely. Additionally, they occasionally hallucinate the feeling of small animals such as snakes crawling over their body. Such vivid tactile sensation of an object that is not present results from the unsuccessful attempt of the brain trying to perceive objects that are novel and that represent unreal situations usually triggered by guilt and fear. Patients with schizophrenia also have a hard time portraying emotions as they divert most of their energy to control the pain from their tactile hallucinations.Olfactory and tactile hallucinations correlate with one another in terms of prevalence in patients with schizophrenia. One particular study was conducted by Langdon et al., in which the prevalence of <b>olfactory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> and tactile hallucinations was analyzed in two distinct clinical samples of patients with schizophrenia. One of the samples contained patients with schizophrenia with tactile hallucinations as reported by the World Health Organization while the other sample contained cases with negative and positive types of tactile hallucinations in patients with schizophrenia. It was concluded that about 13%-17% of patients with schizophrenia experience olfactory and tactile hallucinations. The study reported that socio-cultural factors influenced self-reporting of tactile hallucinations. Since hallucinations in general were feared as a symptoms of insanity, patients were reluctant to seek help for such symptoms. Moreover, the study concluded that tactile hallucinations were usually accompanied by several other hallucinations associated with different modalities such as taste and sight. However, the study failed to recognize the pathophysiology of tactile hallucinations in individuals with schizophrenia.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundSchizophreniform syndromes can {{be divided}} into primary forms from {{polygenic}} causes or secondary forms due to immunological, epileptiform, monogenic, or degenerative causes. Steroid-responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT) is a secondary immunological form associated with increased thyroid antibodies, such as antithyroid peroxidase antibodies and shows a good response to corticosteroids. Case presentationWe present the case of a 41 -year-old woman suffering from a schizophreniform syndrome. Starting at the age of 35, she developed psychotic exacerbations with formal thought disorder, acoustic hallucinations, cenesthopathic experiences, and loss of ego boundaries. At the same time, she began to suffer from chronic sexual delusions and <b>olfactory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> which did not respond to neuroleptic medication. Her levels of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies were slightly increased, and the blood–brain barrier was disturbed. An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed intermittent generalized slowing, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) depicted mild temporolateral atrophy. High-dose corticosteroid treatment led to convincing improvement of attentional performance and the disappearance of delusions and <b>olfactory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> ConclusionSREAT can mimic typical symptoms of schizophreniform syndromes. The increased titer of antithyroid peroxidase antibodies in combination with the EEG slowing, blood–brain barrier dysfunction, and the cMRI alterations were the basis for suspecting an immunological cause in our patient.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dystrobrevin binding protein 1 (DTNBP 1) is a {{schizophrenia}} susceptibility gene {{involved with}} neurotransmission regulation (especially dopamine and glutamate) and neurodevelopment. The gene {{is known to}} be associated with cognitive deficit phenotypes within schizophrenia. In our previous studies, DTNBP 1 was found associated not only with schizophrenia but with other psychiatric disorders including psychotic depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, nicotine dependence and opiate dependence. These findings suggest that DNTBP 1 may be involved in pathways that lead to multiple psychiatric phenotypes. In this study, we explored the association between DTNBP 1 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and multiple psychiatric phenotypes included in the Diagnostic Interview of Psychosis (DIP). METHODS: Five DTNBP 1 SNPs, rs 17470454, rs 1997679, rs 4236167, rs 9370822 and rs 9370823, were genotyped in 235 schizophrenia subjects screened for various phenotypes in the domains of depression, mania, hallucinations, delusions, subjective thought disorder, behaviour and affect, and speech disorder. SNP-phenotype association was determined with ANOVA under general, dominant/recessive and over-dominance models. RESULTS: Post hoc tests determined that SNP rs 1997679 was associated with visual hallucination; SNP rs 4236167 was associated with general auditory hallucination as well as specific features including non-verbal, abusive and third-person form auditory hallucinations; and SNP rs 9370822 was associated with visual and <b>olfactory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> SNPs that survived correction for multiple testing were rs 4236167 for third-person and abusive form auditory hallucinations; and rs 9370822 for <b>olfactory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> CONCLUSION: These data suggest that DTNBP 1 is likely {{to play a role in}} development of auditory related, visual and <b>olfactory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> which is consistent with evidence of DTNBP 1 activity in the auditory processing regions, in visual processing and in the regulation of glutamate and dopamine activit...|$|E
