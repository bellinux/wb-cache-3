5|$|There {{were over}} 13,000 Royal Military Police (“redcaps”). They were unpopular, {{at a time}} when the police were often unpopular with young men from big cities. Besides policing, a large part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> was {{maintaining}} discipline on the march and keeping roads running smoothly, and collecting stragglers from a battle. During the March 1918 retreat 25,000 stragglers were rounded up and sent back to fighting units. Royal Military Police also fought on occasion if headquarters areas were threatened by an enemy advance. Although soldiers sometimes told lurid tales of men who refused to fight being shot by Military Police, no reliable first-hand accounts exist of this happening.|$|E

The president of the Switchmen's Mutual Association called the heads of the Order of Railway Conductors, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen to Buffalo for a meeting. But the August 23 conference was brief: The other unions refused to take their members out on strike.|$|E
25|$|While {{the career}} field was still young {{and lacking in}} {{manpower}} from so little Army pathfinder transfers, Air Force headquarters solicited from radio maintenance career field for more Combat Controllers. It was also stipulated that Combat Controllers would have to attend air traffic control school {{if they would be}} controlling aircraft from the ground. Because <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> Combat Controllers had to have either an air traffic control AFSC or a radio maintenance AFSC in addition to jump school to become a Combat Controller. This gave rise to blousing trousers and wearing paratrooper boots, a tradition that still exists to the present.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, {{there is}} no {{corresponding}} body of regulations applicable to U.S. workers who operate motor vehicles other than large trucks or buses as part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> duties: i.e., those who operate lighter vehicles that are employer-owned or leased, or those who drive personal vehicles for work purposes. It is true that at-work drivers are covered by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) “general duty clause”, which requires that an employer provide “employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees”.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of mobile}} phones {{by people who}} are driving has become {{increasingly}} common, for example as part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> {{as in the case of}} delivery drivers who are calling a client, or socially as for commuters who are chatting with a friend. While many drivers have embraced the convenience of using their cellphone while driving, some jurisdictions have made the practice against the law, such as Australia, the Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador as well as the United Kingdom, consisting of a zero-tolerance system operated in Scotland and a warning system operated in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Officials from these jurisdictions argue that using a mobile phone while driving is an impediment to vehicle operation that can increase the risk of road traffic accidents.|$|E
25|$|According to his accounts, Cooper {{realized}} that these men, who {{on a regular}} basis have seen experimental aircraft flying and landing around them as part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> of filming those aircraft, were clearly worked up and unnerved. They explained how the saucer hovered over them, landed 50 yards away from them using three extended landing gears and then took off as they approached for a closer look. They took photographs and film. There was a special Pentagon number to call to report such incidents: called and soon was reported up the chain of command until he was instructed by a general to have the film developed, but to make no prints of it, and send it right away in a locked courier pouch. As he had not been instructed to not look at the negatives before sending them, he did. He said the quality of the photography was excellent as would be expected from the experienced photographers who took them. What he saw was exactly what they had described to him. He did not see the film before everything was sent away. He expected {{that there would be a}} follow up investigation since an aircraft of unknown origin had landed in a highly classified military installation, but nothing was ever said of the incident again. He was never able to track down what happened to those photos. He assumed that they ended up going to the Air Force's official UFO investigation, Project Blue Book, which was based at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.|$|E

2500|$|Organizational {{citizenship}} {{behaviors are}} actions that employees take {{to support the}} organization that go {{above and beyond the}} scope <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> description. [...] OCBs are related to both procedural justice (DeConick, 2010; Cohen-Charash & Spector, 2001; Karriker & Williams, 2009) and distributive justice perceptions (Cohen-Charash & Spector, 2001; Karriker & Williams, 2009). [...] As organizational actions and decisions are perceived as more just, employees are {{more likely to engage in}} OCBs. [...] Karriker and Williams (2009) established that OCBs are directed toward either the supervisor or the organization depending on whether the perception of just stems from the supervisor or the organization. [...] Additionally, a relationship was found between interpersonal justice and OCBs; however, this relationship was not mediated by the source of justice perceptions (Karriker & Williams, 2009).|$|E

2500|$|Person Environment Fit Model: [...] This model [...] "suggests {{that the}} match between {{a person and}} their work {{environment}} is key in influencing their health. For healthy conditions, {{it is necessary that}} employees’ attitudes, skills, abilities and resources match the demands <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> and that work environments should meet workers’ needs, knowledge, and skills potential. Lack of fit in either of these domains can cause problems, and the greater the gap or misfit (either subjective or objective) between the person and their environment, the greater the strain as demands exceed abilities, and need exceeds supply. These strains can relate to health related issues, lower productivity, and other work problems. Defense mechanisms, such as denial, reappraisal of needs, and coping, also operate in the model, to try and reduce subjective misfit" ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{each of the}} Operation Reinhard {{extermination}} camps Trawniki Hiwi men {{served as}} the Sonderkommando guard units (between 70 and 120 depending on location) and were selected to act as the gas chambers operators. They came {{under the jurisdiction of}} the relevant camp commandant. Almost all of the Trawniki guards were involved in shooting, beating and terrorizing Jews. The Russian historian Sergei Kudryashov, who made a study of the Trawniki men serving at death camps claimed that there was little sign of any attraction to National Socialism among them. He claimed that most of the guards volunteered in order to leave the POW camps and/or because of self-interest. On the other hand, the Holocaust historian Christopher R. Browning wrote that Hiwis [...] "were screened on the basis of their anti-Communist and hence almost invariably anti-Semitic sentiments." [...] Despite the generally apathetic views of the Trawniki guards, the vast majority faithfully carried out the SS expectations in the mistreatment of Jews. Most Trawniki men executed Jews already as part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> training. Similarly to Christopher Browning's 1992 book Ordinary Men, Kudryashov argued that the Trawniki men were examples of how ordinary people could become willing killers.|$|E
2500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{called it}} [...] "the {{best of the}} [...] career so far".

[...] Geoff Andrew of Time Out London expressed that [...] "the film exerts a grip from start to end". Richard Corliss of Time magazine chose the film as {{the best of the}} year and said that [...] "after two decades of being brilliant on the movie margins, the Coens are ready for their closeup, and maybe their Oscar". Paul Arendt of the BBC gave the film a full mark and said that it [...] "doesn't require a defense: it is a magnificent return to form". A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated that [...] "for formalists – those moviegoers sent into raptures by tight editing, nimble camera work and faultless sound design – it's pure heaven." [...] Both Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from the ABC show At The Movies gave the film five stars, making No Country for Old Men the only film to receive such a rating from the hosts in 2007. Both praised the film for its visual language and suspense, David commenting that [...] "Hitchcock wouldn't have done the suspense better".|$|E
2500|$|Entoptics {{are another}} feature of {{abstraction}} technology and consist of various visual layers interpolated into human sight {{at some point}} between the viewer's cornea and visual cortex. These effects can either be created by a single person (e.g., the projection of the appearance of clothing, glowing tattoos, etc.) or an authority (e.g., public visual displays [...] "projected" [...] into mid-air {{without the use of}} any actual display devices). While some forms of abstraction, especially those in use during the Belle Epoque, were profoundly immersive and based on wireless networking between sophisticated brain implants and local computer architecture, entoptics by themselves could be technologically quite simple, with convincing visual phantoms being produced solely within ordinary ocular implants, or artificial eyes. The Conjoiners developed the first Entoptics early in their history, used in [...] "Great Wall of Mars". By the time of The Prefect, much of humanity was engaged in abstraction in some form. Most of the characters in Reynolds' novels participate in abstraction through the use of neural implants, though after the advent of the Melding Plague, when complex cybernetics became liable to dangerous infections, many characters choose simply to use entoptics without engaging in the more intimate forms abstraction could take. Others, such as the Prefects of Panoply, a police force charged with defending the universal enfranchisement championed by Demarchists, are explicitly denied access to abstraction implants as part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job,</b> in order to foreclose potential avenues for the manipulation or obstruction of justice. Instead, Prefects carry with them simple pairs of goggles which simulate entoptics for use in situations where they need to be privy to activity within local abstraction, without having it broadcast immediately into their nervous systems.|$|E

2500|$|Training for EMDs is {{required}} to meet a National Standard Curriculum, as outlined by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration of the U.S. government. [...] This training program may be offered by private companies, by community colleges, or by some large EMS systems which are self-dispatching. [...] The minimum length of such training is 32 classroom hours, covering such topics as EMD Roles and Responsibilities, Legal and Liability Issues in EMD, National and State Standards for EMD, Resource Allocation, Layout and Structure of EMD Guidecards, Obtaining Information from Callers, Anatomy and Physiology, Chief Complaint Types, Quality Assurance & Recertification and Stress Management. [...] Certification in CPR is not mandatory, but {{upon completion of the}} training, students are required to sit a certification examination. [...] Upon completion of the training and certification, Emergency Medical Dispatchers are required to complete 24 hours of Continuing Dispatch Education every two years, in order to maintain certification. [...] This level of training and certification only satisfies the national curriculum, and in most cases, additional training will be required. [...] Additional training will have a local focus, and will deal with local geographical knowledge, dispatch procedures, local laws and service policy. [...] Additional training may be required to orient new emergency medical dispatchers to different forms of 9-1-1 telecommunication (if this will be a part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>job</b> function). [...] This may also include (depending on the jurisdiction) EFD (Emergency Fire Dispatching), EPD (Emergency Police Dispatching), ETC (emergency telecommunication), ECE (Executive Certification Course), CMC (Communication Center Manager), when such services are jointly operated.
