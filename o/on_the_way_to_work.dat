25|$|In the {{era when}} long {{distance}} trips took several days, sleeping accommodations were {{an essential part}} of transportation. (On land, the lodging involved was often part of the infrastructure: the inn or ryokan, which did not move, sheltered travellers. People also slept on ships at sea.) Today, most airlines, inter-city trains and coaches offer reclining seats and many provide pillows and blankets for overnight travellers. Better sleeping arrangements are commonly offered for a premium fare and include sleeping cars on overnight trains, larger private cabins on ships and aircraft seats that convert into beds. Budget-conscious tourists sometimes plan their trips using overnight train or bus journeys in lieu of paying for a hotel. The ability to get additional sleep <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> is attractive to many commuters using public transport.|$|E

Ray Davies of The Kinks arrived in a black cab and played [...] "Waterloo Sunset", as Spelbound continued and local school children formed the Thames. [...] The section closed with Sandé reprising [...] "Read All About It (Pt. III)" [...] as a montage of athletes crying in victory or defeat was shown on the screens.|$|E

2500|$|Sircello distinguishes {{pleasure}} from enjoyment. He uses propositional pleasure {{as an example}} of a particular type of pleasure distinct from enjoyment. [...] Propositional pleasure is characterized as a pleasure taken in the occurrence of a fact, event, state or the like. [...] Such pleasure is relatively passive. [...] We may take pleasure in the outcome of a ball game or in the fact that traffic is light <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> but the pleasure itself resulting from this satisfaction is something that happens to the subject rather than something they effect. [...] Enjoyment is constituted by the active role played by the subject. [...] Enjoyment can be obtained from experiences that are not entirely pleasant in all their parts via effort or resolve on the part of the subject. [...] For instance, a strenuous hike can be enjoyable even though parts of it may be difficult and painful. [...] The subject’s resolve and ability to overcome difficulties can make the hike enjoyable despite these troubles. [...] Enjoyment involves a complex relationship to desire in that enjoyment tends to fuel further desires for its continuation. [...] As such enjoyment of experience is fundamental in Sircello’s theory of love.|$|E
2500|$|Suddenly, Sisko {{transitions}} entirely {{into his}} vision, becoming Benny Russell, an African-American science fiction writer in 1950s New York City. Russell {{writes for the}} science fiction magazine Incredible Tales, {{and most of the}} people he encounters bear the likeness of people from Sisko's life on the station. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> Russell buys the latest edition of Galaxy, their competitor, from a local newsboy (Aron Eisenberg/Nog). He then runs into his coworker Albert Macklin (Colm Meaney/O'Brien), and the two walk to work together. There, short-tempered liberal writer Herbert Rossoff (Armin Shimerman/Quark) argues with magazine editor Douglas Pabst (René Auberjonois/Odo) over donuts, while writers Kay Eaton, a.k.a. K.C. Hunter, (Nana Visitor/Kira) and Julius Eaton (Alexander Siddig/Bashir) banter in the background. The magazine's illustrator Roy Ritterhouse (J. G. Hertzler/Martok) then arrives with a stack of sketches for the next edition. Russell is particularly drawn to a sketch of a space station much like Deep Space 9, and decides to write a story for it. When Pabst announces the next edition will include photos of the staff, he suggests Kay [...] "sleep late" [...] that morning, as the public would not respond well to the revelation she is a woman. Russell realizes he also will not be included, which Pabst confirms. Rossoff objects, but Pabst stands firm, choosing to conform to the prevailing public opinion.|$|E
2500|$|In 1883, Luther Standing Bear {{was sent}} to Philadelphia to work as an intern for John Wanamaker. Wanamaker's was the first {{department}} store in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{and one of the}} first department stores in the United States. Luther was told by Pratt: [...] "My boy you are going away from us to work for this school. Go and do your best. The majority of white people think the Indian is a lazy good-for-nothing. They think he can neither work nor learn anything; that he is very dirty. Now you are going to prove that the red man can learn and work as well as the white man. If John Wanamaker gives you he job of blacking his shoes, see that you make them shine. Then he will give you a better job. If you are put into the office to clean, don’t forget to sweep up under the chairs and in the corners. If you do this well, he will give you better work to do." [...] While riding on street cars in Philadelphia, Luther did not care to listen to the vulgar language used by white boys <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> At the end of his internship, the entire Carlisle school students and faculty traveled to a large meeting hall in Philadelphia where Pratt and Wanamaker spoke. Luther was asked to come to the stage, and Wanamaker told the students that Luther had been promoted from one department to another every month getting better work and better money and in spite of the fact that he employed over one thousand people, he never promoted anyone as rapidly as Luther.|$|E

6000|$|Early in the morning, {{along the}} streets frequented by workmen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> many women sit on the {{sidewalk}} with sacks of bread beside them. No end of workmen purchase these, and eat them as they walk along. They do not even wash the dry bread down with the tea to be obtained for a penny in the coffee-houses. It is incontestable that a man is not fit to begin his day's work on a meal like that; and it is equally incontestable that the loss will fall upon his employer and upon the nation. For some time, now, statesmen have been crying, [...] "Wake up, England!" [...] It would show more hard-headed common sense if they changed the tune to [...] "Feed up, England!" ...|$|E
