40|$|Introduction and Aims: Since the 1990 s {{illicit drug}} use death rates in Australia have {{increased}} markedly. There is a notable gap in knowledge about changing socio-economic inequalities in drug use death rates. Some limited Australian and <b>overseas</b> data <b>point</b> to higher rates of drug death in the lowest socio-economic groups, but the paucity of available studies and their sometimes conflicting findings need to be addressed. Design and Methods: This paper uses data obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to examine changes in age-standardised drug-induced mortality rates for Australian males over the period 1981 – 2002. Socio-economic status was categorised as manual or non-manual work status. Results: With the rapid increase in drug-induced mortality rates in the 1990 s, there was a parallel increase in socio-economic inequalities in drug-induced deaths. The decline in drug death rates from 2000 onwards {{was associated with a}} decline in socio-economic inequalities. By 2002, manual workers had drug death rates well over twice the rate of non-manual workers. Discussion: Three factors are identified which contribute to these socio-economic inequalities in mortality. First, there has been an age shift in deaths evident only for manual workers. Secondly, there has been an increase in availability until 1999 and a relative decline in the cost of the drug, which most often leads to drug death (heroin). Thirdly, there has been a shift to amphetamine use which may lead to significant levels of morbidity, but few deaths. [Najman JM, Toloo G, Williams GM.

40|$|As {{a result}} of {{advancing}} globalization and economic activities that go beyond national borders, gross domestic product (GDP) and gross national product (GNP) are becoming dissociated.

A difference between them is, generally speaking, the former focuses on whether economic activities take place in the country, while the latter on whether the economic activities are conducted by residents of the country. Thus, the relationship between the two is as follows: GNP = GDP + factor incomes from overseas – factor incomes going <b>overseas.</b> This article <b>points</b> to interesting implications of globalization suggested by relative size of GDP and GNP growth variations.

40|$|M. Tech. (Architectural Technology) The {{inner city}} space {{is a living}} and working locale for diverse {{population}} groups. The central business district provides job opportunities for a multitude of skilled and unskilled workers who either {{live in the city}} or who commute from outlying areas and suburbs. In other words, it serves many purposes for many people. Yet it is rarely acknowledged as an appropriate space for young children. Reality, however, shows that children should and are accommodated within the inner city. They are part of the families that engage with the city on a daily basis. The research question addressed by this study mainly concerns how the architecture should respond to a situation which acknowledges the presence of children in the inner city {{in a way that is}} not only safe and secure but also draws on the unique learning experiences that the city offers. In this respect there are endless possibilities for discovery and sensory exploration. The city is a sensory cornucopia, of sorts. The challenge is therefore to create a relationship between the pre-school and the city that is symbiotic. Because life is the generator of the city, children add another layer to its intriguing complexities. In return, the city provides exciting educational experiences which "have the potential to ensure that memories are made and remembered. An urban preschool is not typified by the way it mirrors the urban context or incorporates it thematically, but by the way it engages and becomes part of its pattern language. Existing boundaries which are often restrictive and prescriptive are deconstructed and reconstructed, and, in doing so, the identity and the conventional stereotype of the urban preschool is redefined.

40|$|In Shakespeare’s Henry VI, Part II, a pretender to {{the throne}} {{outlines}} the Utopia that will come when his unruly mob helps make him king. The unruliest of them all, Dick the Butcher, leers in an aside to the audience, “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers. ” Wherever and whenever it is staged around the world, Dick always brings the house down. Steven Spielberg uses much the same technique in the movie Jurassic Park, when the venal lawyer is eaten by the T rex while on the toilet. Guffaws all round. Now I’m not here to naysay lawyer jokes. Keep ’em coming, I say. I am just here to alert you to the reflex the former NSW premier Bob Carr is hitting when he calls any attempt to legally protect human rights {{in a piece of}} legislation as leading to a “lawyer’s picnic. ” Bob Carr argues that codifying rights in any way will lead to a frenzy of litigation which will only benefit those bloodsucking parasitic lawyers, and so has opposed attempts to introduce a human rights charter in New South Wales. (Victoria and the ACT now have human rights legislation and Tasmania is set to follow.) Carr repeats this argument regularly now in relation to proposals to protect human rights at the federal level. (Just try Googling “Bob Carr” and “lawyers. ” You can add “Senator Brandis” and “Archbishop Pell” for further highlights and colourful invective on this theme.) I’m betting that when Carr invokes lawyers while talking about human rights he wants you to think of lawyers from big glass offices overlooking the harbour in fancy suits, chowing down on salmon nibbly bits in a marquee. Presumably he is not referring to a human rights lawyer’s picnic, which usually features hummus, a bit of John Butler on the radio and lots of hugging. I promise you these affairs are in no way to be feared. (At least not as much as a hypothetical picnic with Carr, Pell and Brandis.) The other useful tactic is to invoke the ever-present danger of activist judges, as Janet Albrechtsen often does {{in the pages of the}} Australian (“Rights charter is from 2009 BC”, 14 January). Everyone knows judges are a bunch of free-loving social-reforming radicals just itching to get their mitts on some raw unchecked power that rightfully belongs to those saintly pollies. This time Janet manages to make a lively association between activist judges in Canada, the Australian human rights consultation and polygamy. (I am often left wondering which judges Ms Albrechtson is meeting and whether I can go to one of their picnics.) Janet was roused to action because federal attorney-general Robert McClelland has announced a national consultation on the protection of human rights and responsibilities, headed by Father Frank Brennan, to report in June. The fur, in other words, folks, is about to fly. The “lawyer’s picnic” and the “power-mad judge” mantras are about to be invoked. My point is that the opportunity of the consultation is more important than any of the messengers you are going to hear from in the papers. Carr is correct, in a way. Human rights protection is not, and should not be, about lawyers. It is not even about premiers or archbishops. The whole point of the exercise should be making sure that bad stuff does not happen to people in the first place. Human rights at their core are about the conversations citizens could have with their government about the ways power should be used against individuals, and what obligations citizens should have towards others in their communities. In my experience, Australians often think three things when they hear the words “human rights,” based on stereotypes and the odd news story: 1. “Human rights are about what happens to terrorists and boat people or foreigners generally, not about me. ” 2. “Bad human rights stuff only happens overseas, not here. ” 3. “Human rights are about big public issues like the death penalty or stoning or coups. Somewhere <b>overseas</b> (see <b>point</b> 2). To foreigners (see point 1). It doesn’t affect my everyday life and my family. ” Human rights are involved in these big international issues, and touch on many fault lines in society about race, religion and politics. But where countries have enacted human rights legislation, such as in Britain, it is ordinary folk engaged in everyday activities involving government services that have often reaped the benefits. Meet Beryll Driscoll. Beryll and Richard Driscoll, now in their 90 s, married in 1940. Mr Driscoll did war service in Burma, and when he came back they were always together. When Mr Driscoll became ill and went to live in an aged-care facility, Beryll wanted to join him. Gloucestershire social services stopped her. The Driscoll family launched a campaign to reunite their parents. Using the UK Human Rights Act they managed to persuade the council to reverse its decision and offer Mrs Driscoll a subsidised place in the same home as her husband. Human rights can be about the way your government treats you, every day. Do you feel like a person with dignity treated with respect when you go to Centrelink? What about when your parents went into an aged care home? What about when you go? What about when you are a public patient in a NSW hospital? What about when your teenage son gets arrested for being at a protest or a nightclub that is raided? What about when the bank lends you too much money and then you can’t repay? What about your access to medical treatment for cancer when you live out on a farm, hours from the nearest town? What about when the government closes your local school? Or sets up a power plant next door? Or both? Often, human rights protections provide no solutions for any of these things, but they offer counter-arguments and a point of view based on the dignity of the individual. The impact on an individual or family is usually the first thing that gets lost when governments face hard decisions, especially about resources. Think of the movie The Castle. What can one family do when the weight of the state is pressing down on them? Other than make friends with a barrister who miraculously offers to represent you in the High Court for free, that is? Whatever you think about human rights, there is a rare opportunity in the national consultation to have your say. Use ’em or lose ’em. When the government is passing legislation or considering big policy decisions it needs a tool where it is reminded to think of people as individuals about to be affected by that law or decision. Let’s build a system where we don’t need the lawyers. They are always off picnicking anyway. • Susan Harris Rimmer is a researcher at the Australian National University, president of Australian Lawyers for Human Rights and a member of the Australian Human Rights Group.

40|$|THIS {{article is}} about an {{injustice}} to the reputation of a great editor, a matter touching on the affair of Rupert Max Stuart, the Aborigine from a travelling fun-fair, who was spared the gallows in Adelaide in 1959. So with the Stuart Case we can conveniently begin. 	This is an important case for various reasons, not least for the strong assurance it provides {{that there really is}} such a thing as the public conscience, and that it can be effective even against the obduracy of government and the blindness of the legal system. If only it can be awakened in time. 	In this case it saved the life of an illiterate Aborigine. Stuart was sentenced to death when found guilty of the sickening crime of murdering a nine-year-old girl after raping her. Not a likely cause for enthusiasm. But there were elements of the police investigation, and in the trial, that troubled a growing number of people. Appeals through the courts failed; a petition to the Playford government failed. But a Catholic priest searched and found further evidence, the Privy Council thought it should be examined, and so a royal commission sat amid controversy - and decided that the original conviction should stand. But before it reported, the Stuart affair had reached a pitch locally and nationally and brought concern <b>overseas,</b> to a <b>point</b> where a hanging had become impossible. The sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, which did not really mean life. 	Stuart, like the doubts about his conviction, remains alive today, a senior citizen of Alice Springs, respected former chairman of the Central Land Council, who greeted the Queen when she visited the Alice in 2000. 	THERE is a flurry of fresh material about the Stuart case. A new film, Black and White, an Australian-UK co-production, has Robert Carlyle, Charles Dance, Kerry Fox, David Ngoombujarra, Colin Friels and Ben Mendelssohn in the main roles. Its first showing marked the opening of the Sydney Film Festival in June; it is due for general release later this year. 	A book, The Stuart Case, by Ken Inglis, has just come out. The title will be familiar to some. Inglis, when a senior history academic at Adelaide University, wrote the definitive work, The Stuart Case, published in 1961 by Melbourne University Press. I have always thought this a superbly balanced account, and on reading it again last month was again gripped by it. The new book comprises a re-issue of this work by Black Inc, with a 76 -page epilogue and chronology, bringing developments up to 2002. 	And then there is the speech by Justice Michael Kirby of the High Court, delivered to a NSW law conference at the end of July. The Advertiser carried a shortened version on August 2. What is relevant here is Justice Kirby’s “sobering discovery” from the film that the saving of Max Stuart’s life was not effected by the law, its machinery and its practitioners; the “real saviour” was a young media controller named Rupert Murdoch, then at the outset of his career. 	Well, let me say that it was not Rupert Murdoch either. Murdoch, the managing director, was not the one who led Adelaide’s then afternoon paper, the News, in a crusade over the Stuart affair. It was Rohan Deakin Rivett, editor-in-chief and board member, an editor of entirely unaccustomed quality in the post-war Adelaide press, and in other capitals outshone by none. He was to pay dearly for the Stuart connection. Kirby did not say whether he was represented in the film at all. Nor does the writer and journalist Evan Whitton mention him in an article on the Stuart case published in the Sydney Morning Herald on the eve of the film’s showing. Whitton, too, has attributed the saving of Max Stuart to Murdoch. 	Ken Inglis, in the epilogue to his book, says he had not seen the film to the time of writing, but he is nevertheless able to describe some considerable discrepancies in individual characters. He has also read publicity that enlarges Rupert Murdoch’s role. Inglis expects to watch Black and White “as a very old survivor from early Tudor England might have sat through the first performance of The Famous History of the Reign of King Henry VIII at the Globe Theatre and marvelled at the blend of fact and fiction Will Shakespeare had contrived from events in the spectator’s own memory. ” I too have yet to see the film, but I suppose all changes will be written off as art or necessary commercialism. 	IN TRUTH, nobody can properly be singled out as Stuart’s saviour. Too many people played foremost parts. It was the combined strength of the conscience movement that prolonged Stuart’s life to the point where Playford could no longer safely hang him and felt driven to commute. 	In that campaign the News proved a powerful ally. the Advertiser stood back. The News was not directly involved until Father Tom Dixon, the priest in search of evidence, met Rohan Rivett. Dixon had talked for two months with Stuart in his own Arrernte tongue, and believed he was innocent. Rivett agreed to fund Dixon’s plans to fly to Queensland to find witnesses who might help Stuart’s case. The execution date lent urgency. 	At this stage Rivett presumably informed Murdoch, but the decision was his own. He was a born crusader and he used the News like a trumpet. He was not backing Stuart’s innocence, but seeking information that would settle the doubts one way or another, a position which some people found easy to distort. 	I was a journalist with the News in those days. I hardly ever saw Murdoch in the editorial department during the Stuart case or any other time. Rivett gave every appearance of running the show, and few, I think, suspected that strains existed. But they did. Since taking over after the death of Sir Keith, his father, who had appointed Rivett, young Murdoch had learned quickly. Inevitably, he began to take more control and tread on Rivett’s toes. There was nothing much Rivett could do about it, except make a stand where possible, until some unpredictable but inevitable showdown. Murdoch did intervene editorially in the Stuart affair at times. A case is on record in which he and Rivett between them wrote two posters and a headline. Again, in Rivett’s absence Murdoch wrote a leading article to defend the paper against threatening words from Playford and to apologise for a headline and one of the posters. In London, the journalist James Cameron was lionising Rivett in print as the Zola of South Australia, which we provincial journalists greeted with affected cynicism. 	With the conclusion of the royal commission and an end to the Stuart case there were hard times ahead for Rivett. Playford pursued him with a vengeance: three charges of seditious libel, three of malicious libel knowing it to be false, three of malicious libel. News Ltd, the company, was similarly charged. Rivett faced the possibility of jail or heavy fines, or both. In parliament Playford had inflated one headline into “the gravest libel ever made against any judge in this State. ” Rivett was adroitly, and at times hilariously, represented in court by Dr J. J. Bray and H. G. Alderman. The judge was persuaded to throw out the counts of seditious libel, and the jury found for Rivett on five of the other charges, disagreeing on the sixth. This was eventually withdrawn. 	Five weeks later Rivett received a very brief letter from Murdoch, who had shifted his headquarters to Sydney. It told Rivett he was dismissed. No explanation was given. 	A long time afterwards, Murdoch told William Shawcross, one of his biographers, that in the wake of their Stuart case victory Rivett had agreed to cool things, yet soon afterwards he published a front page denouncing the government more angrily than before. It sounds quite odd. My friend Peter Gifford, once a News journalist, decided to look into this in researching the thesis that later gained him a PhD. But there was no such article. Strange. Behind the confusion, the basic truth would seem to be that Murdoch did not trust Rivett to do what he was told, even less so from the distance of Sydney. He was too much his own man. 	RIVETT had nearly nine years as editor-in-chief (which at the News meant editor also). Why should he be described as a great editor? They are rare birds. 	Certainly he came well equipped: first-class honours in history and political science from Melbourne University, then Balliol College, Oxford; natural in command, easy in company; energetic, attractive personality who treated journalism as a calling. His family connections were advantageous: his father was Sir David Rivett, chairman of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (later the CSIRO), and he had Alfred Deakin the prime minister for a grandfather. 	 He was a war correspondent broadcasting from Singapore when the Japanese captured the city. How he escaped, was bombed at sea, trekked through jungle and with his small party rowed the next 650 kilometres in a small native craft, is told in the first of his books, the classic Behind Bamboo. Captured near Java, he served as a prisoner-of-war in Java, Burma and Thailand. 	To a small daily in Adelaide he gave a breadth of content and ideas that transformed it into a paper that mattered nationally. He became through this, and his own writing, broadcasting and public speaking, a significant figure nationally. He travelled. He was sometimes described as radical, but I think that left-liberal idealist is nearer the mark. 	He stood for such policies as the recognition of Communist China, abandonment of the crude White Australia policy, the development of India as the great counter-weight to China. He adopted a cautious, modifying role in the Cold War, recognising the historical causes of some of Russia’s fears. Of Australia’s relations with the United States, he could write, “Subservience is not always the best form of loyalty. ” He had little sympathy for Menzies. 	 Rivett suffered a fatal heart attack in 1977. He was 60. He was not of course without his faults. But as a force for good in journalism and this life, Rohan Rivett dwarfs Rupert Murdoch.
