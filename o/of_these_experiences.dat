5|$|Colonel Bankhead was {{replaced}} by Lieutenant Colonel William S. Harney in 1839. Colonel Harney had two earlier encounters with Seminoles, the first a battle in which Chief Arpeika eluded capture, and a second in which Harney escaped in only his shirt and drawers from an early morning attack (the Harney Massacre) on his camp led by Chief Chakaika. In light <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>experiences,</b> Harney instituted an intensive training program in swamp and jungle warfare for his men. After Chakaika led the raid on Indian Key in August 1840, Harney set out into the Everglades after Chakaika, and killed him in his own camp. The war quieted down after that, with active pursuit of the Seminoles ending in 1842, {{although some of the}} Seminoles remained hidden in the Everglades.|$|E

Of the possible game endings, in series canon Valentine kills a supersoldier released by Wesker and escapes the self-destructing mansion with the STARS squad. As a result <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>experiences,</b> Valentine forms a strong friendship with Redfield and becomes a passionate opponent of bioterrorism.

25|$|Sembène drew on many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>experiences</b> for his French-language first novel, Le Docker Noir (The Black Docker, 1956), {{the story}} of Diaw, an African {{stevedore}} who faces racism and mistreatment on the docks at Marseille. Diaw writes a novel, which is later stolen by a white woman and published under her name; he confronts her, accidentally kills her, and is tried and executed in scenes highly reminiscent of Albert Camus's The Stranger (also translated as The Outsider). Though the book focuses particularly on the mistreatment of African immigrants, Sembène also details the oppression of Arab and Spanish workers, {{making it clear that}} the issues are as much economic as they are racial. Like most of his fiction, it is written in a social realist mode. Many critics today consider the book somewhat flawed; however, it began Sembène's literary reputation and provided him with the financial support to continue writing.|$|E

[...] Although it has been claimed that Andros {{was present at the}} surrender in 1651 of Guernsey's Castle Cornet, the last royalist stronghold to surrender in the English Civil War, there is no firm evidence to support this. It is possible that he fled Guernsey with his mother in 1645. In 1656, he was apprenticed to his uncle, Sir Robert Stone, captain of a cavalry company. [...] Andros then served in two winter campaigns in Denmark, including the relief of Copenhagen in 1659.

Scher contacted Albee, who allowed Scher to establish a new chapter of JC's Girls in San Diego. Scher founded the chapter in 2007 with Sheri Brown, a former social worker. Brown had previously hated strippers, but, once she had accepted a job helping teenage mothers finish high school and the first four teens she worked with were strippers, she said that she developed [...] "an overwhelming passion to reach out to these precious women in love and without condemnation." [...] She has described being sexually abused as a child and later being a teenage mother; Brown found that both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>experiences</b> helped her to relate to strippers, as many of the strippers she encountered also had those experiences.|$|E

2500|$|In the Western world, {{much of the}} {{bereavement}} {{literature of}} the 20th century had been influenced by psychoanalytic thinking and viewed these experiences {{as a form of}} denial, in the tradition of Freud's interpretation in Mourning and Melancholia of the bereaved person as 'clinging to the object through the medium of a hallucinatory wishful psychosis'. In recent decades, building on cross-cultural evidence about the adaptiveness of such experiences, the continuing bonds perspective as originated by Klass et al. (1996) [...] has suggested that such experiences can be seen as normal and potentially adaptive in a Western context too. Since then, a number of qualitative studies have been published, describing the mainly beneficial effects <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>experiences,</b> especially when they are made sense of in spiritual or religious ways While most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>experiences</b> tend to be reported as comforting to the perceiver, a small percentage of people have reported disturbing experiences, and there is ongoing research, for example by Field and others, to determine when continuing bonds experiences serve adjustment to bereavement and when they may be detrimental.|$|E

2500|$|Dunces is [...] a picaresque novel {{featuring}} the misadventures of protagonist Ignatius J. Reilly, a lazy, obese, misanthropic, self-styled scholar who lives {{at home with}} his mother. It is hailed for its accurate depictions of New Orleans dialects. Toole based Reilly in part on his college professor friend Bob Byrne. Byrne's slovenly, eccentric behavior was anything but professorial, and Reilly mirrored him in these respects. The character was also based on Toole himself, and several personal experiences served as inspiration for passages in the novel. While at Tulane, Toole filled in for a friend at a job as a hot tamale cart vendor, and worked at a family owned and operated clothing factory. Both <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>experiences</b> were later adopted into his fiction.|$|E
2500|$|Presenting a child's life {{beginning}} with birth, Beauvoir contrasts a girl's upbringing with a boy's, who at age 3 or 4 is told he is a [...] "little man".

A girl comes to believe in and to worship a male god and to create imaginary adult lovers. The discovery of sex is a [...] "phenomenon as painful as weaning" [...] and she views it with disgust. When she discovers that men, not women, are the masters of the world this [...] "imperiously modifies her consciousness of herself". Beauvoir describes puberty, the beginning of menstruation, and the way girls imagine sex with a man. She relates several ways that girls in their late teens accept their [...] "femininity", which may include running away from home, fascination with the disgusting, following nature, or stealing. Beauvoir describes sexual relations with men, maintaining that the repercussions of the first <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>experiences</b> informs a woman's whole life.

Her voices bade her go against the English, but in what direction she knew not. In fact, the French leaders had begun, without her knowledge, an attack on St. Loup, whither she galloped and took the fort.* It is, of course, conceivable that the din of onset, which presently became audible, had vaguely reached the senses of the sleeping Maid.
