A log-linear model was estimated by using Panel data method consisting of 24 observations from Mwanza-Misungwi and Shinyanga-Bariadi from 2003 to 2014. The Hausman test was applied to evaluate the fixed effect and random effect by using STATA 11 and EXCEL.

The work of EMBRAPA, the state-owned company in charge for applied research on agriculture, together with research developed by state institutes and universities, especially in the State of São Paulo, have allowed Brazil to become a major innovator in the fields of biotechnology and agronomic practices, resulting in the most efficient agricultural technology for sugarcane cultivation in the world. Efforts have been concentrated in increasing the efficiency of inputs and processes to optimize <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> of feedstock, and the result has been a threefold increase of sugarcane yields in 29 years, as Brazilian average ethanol yields went from 2,024 liters per ha in 1975 to 5,917 liters per ha in 2004; allowing the efficiency of ethanol production to grow at a rate of 3.77% per year. Brazilian biotechnologies include {{the development}} of sugarcane varieties that have a larger sugar or energy content, one of the main drivers for high yields of ethanol per unit of planted area. The increase of the index total recoverable sugar (TRS) from sugarcane has been very significant, 1.5% per year in the period 1977 to 2004, resulting in an increase from 95 to 140 kg/ha. Innovations in the industrial process have allowed an increase in sugar extraction in the period 1977 to 2003.

A series of recent (inter) national policies and guidelines however did not prevent new introductions and further spread of non-indigenous species. But instead of considering invasive plant species as a burden, the biomass production of IAS can be considered and used as an ecosystem service. To assess the possibilities for bioenergy production of four invasive alien plant species in Europe, Fallopia japonica, Heracleum mantegazzianum, Impatiens glandulifera and Solidago gigantea, we determined their biomass production, gross calorifi c value and biogas yield. The viability of the propagules after digestion was also tested to assess the dispersal risk related to the bioenergy chain. Fallopia japonica and S. gigantea achieved a high annual biomass yield of 8. 6 ton DM <b>per</b> <b>hectare.</b> Impatiens glandulifera and H. mantegazzianum had a lower biomass production (5. 8 and 6. 0 ton DM ha- 1).

5000|$|Switchgrass {{has been}} {{researched}} as a renewable bioenergy crop since the mid-1980s, {{because it is a}} native perennial warm season grass with the ability to produce moderate to high yields on marginal farmlands. It is now being considered for use in several bioenergy conversion processes, including cellulosic ethanol production, biogas, and direct combustion for thermal energy applications. The main agronomic advantages of switchgrass as a bioenergy crop are its stand longevity, drought and flooding tolerance, relatively low herbicide and fertilizer input requirements, ease of management, hardiness in poor soil and climate conditions, and widespread adaptability in temperate climates. In some warm humid southern zones, such as Alabama, it has the ability to produce up to 25 oven-dry tonnes per hectare (ODT/ha). A summary of switchgrass yields across 13 research trial sites in the United States found the top two cultivars in each trial to yield 9.4 to 22.9 t/ha, with an average yield of 14.6 ODT/ha. However, these yields were recorded on small plot trials, and commercial field sites could be expected to be at least 20% lower than these results. In the United States, switchgrass yields appear to be highest in warm humid regions with long growing seasons such as the US Southeast and lowest in the dry short season areas of the Northern Great Plains. The energy inputs required to grow switchgrass are favorable when compared with annual seed bearing crops such as corn, soybean, or canola, which can require relatively high energy inputs for field operations, crop drying, and fertilization. Whole plant herbaceous perennial C4 grass feedstocks are desirable biomass energy feedstocks, as they require fewer fossil energy inputs to grow and effectively capture solar energy because of their C4 photosynthetic system and perennial nature. One study cites it takes from 0.97 to 1.34 GJ to produce 1 tonne of switchgrass, compared with 1.99 to 2.66 GJ to produce 1 tonne of corn. Another study found that switchgrass uses 0.8 GJ/ODT of fossil energy compared to grain corn's 2.9 GJ/ODT. [...] Given that switchgrass contains approximately 18.8 GJ/ODT of biomass, the energy output-to-input ratio for the crop can be up to 20:1. [...] This highly favorable ratio is attributable to its relatively high energy <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> and low energy inputs for production.|$|E

Using a panel data approach, combining national agricultural field surveys with relevant GIS and remote sensing products, the model explains nearly 40 % of the total variation in wheat <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> across the country.

Our findings suggest that woredas produce between 9. 8 and 86. 5 % of their locally attainable wheat yields given their altitude, weather conditions, terrain, and plant health.

40|$|Invasive {{alien species}} (IAS) {{are one of}} the most {{important}} drivers of species loss, causing biotic homogenization of the global biodiversity. There is evidence that this decline in diversity affects the performance of ecosystems. Altering ecosystem properties can in turn have an effect on services and goods delivered by ecosystems, which often involves significant harm to society, economy and environment. The total costs of the damage and the control measures are already enormous. But instead of considering invasive plant species and their control as a burden, their biomass production can be considered as an ecosystem service. We assessed the bioenergy potential for anaerobic digestion and combustion of four herbaceous alien plant species that are widely known to be invasive outside their native range: Fallopia japonica, Heracleum mantegazzianum, Impatiens glandulifera and Solidago gigantea. The first objective was to quantify the annual biomass production of the different species. Second, the gross calorific value and biomethane potential was determined through a combustion analysis and batch anaerobic digestion tests. To assess the risk of dispersal due to the valorization process, we also performed viability tests on the digested propagules. Without any optimization of the crops or the application of fertilizers or other inputs, S. gigantea and F. japonica had an average biomass yield of more than 8 ton dry matter <b>per</b> <b>hectare.</b> Impatiens glandulifera and H. mantegazzianum had a significant lower biomass yield (5. 8 and 6. 0 ton DM ha- 1), but still produced more than the most productive Low-Input High-Diversity systems in conservation areas in the same study area. The observed methane yields were comparable to those of bioenergy crops and the studied IAS achieved equal or higher energy <b>outputs</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> (28 - 88 GJ ha- 1) than some of the current bioenergy systems. The risk of further dispersal after the digestion process is limited, because none of the digested propagules were viable. The valorization of the biomass of IAS can create an economic incentive for the control of invasive species and offers the opportunity to reconcile the restoration of the invaded habitats and renewable energy goals. However, caution during harvest and transport is required to prevent the spread of new propagules. An optimal organization of the biomass-to-bioenergy supply chain is therefore necessary. Furthermore, a legal framework on the use of present invasive species as a source for bioenergy is needed to prevent agricultural exploitation and further spread of the IAS.

The household data used has been drawn from a {{survey conducted by the}} author and financed by the Norwegian University of Life Science. The analysis uses models both allowing for and not allowing for village dummies(as cluster controls), the ratio of irrigated land (as proxy for land quality), and other socio-economic variables such as households, belonging to caste groups, and family size (as proxy for access to resources). The result supported the almost ‘stylized fact’ of inverse relationship (IR) between farm size and <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare.</b> Total cash input use and labour hours per hectare were found to be higher on small farms. The findings of regression equations allowing for village dummies and other socio-economic variables do not support the explanation that the IR between farm size and productivity is due to variation in regions as well as access to resources. Nevertheless, family size and caste dummies show some effects on farm value added. The paper further investigates returns to scale in Nepalese agriculture, applying the Cobb-Douglas (CD) production function. The result shows constant returns to scale. Labour input seems more influential in farm production, followed by manure, in the sample farms. The overall result shows that the IR between farm size and <b>output</b> <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> is perhaps due to the result more of other inputs used by small farms rather than diseconomies of scale. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a {{theoretical}} model of land leasing that includes transaction costs, risk pooling motives and non-tradable productive inputs, and investigate the empirical implications of land contracts using {{data collected from}} four villages in Ethiopia. We show that sharecropping is the dominant contract if transaction costs are negligible, but that a rental contract may arise if transaction costs decrease with increasing the tenant’s share of output. When this is the case, the theory predicts that area operated by tenants will be an increasing function of their land endowment and that fixed rental contracts {{will be more likely}} in situations where transaction costs are higher.

Thirty one food crops were found, although only 0. 5 % agriculture land is under irrigation in the area. Fifteen different tree species within agroforestry systems were located and their density varied from 30 - 90 trees/ha. Grain yield, fodder from agroforest trees and crop residue were observed to be highest between 1200 and 1600 m a. s. l. Also the annual energy input- <b>output</b> ratio <b>per</b> <b>hectare</b> was highest between 1200 and 1600 m a. s. l. (1. 46). This higher input- output ratio between 1200 - 1600 m a. s. l. was attributed {{to the fact that}} green fodder, obtained from agroforestry trees, was considered as farm produce. The energy budget across altitudinal zones revealed 95 % contribution of the farmyard manure and the maximum output was in terms of either crop residue (35 %) or fodder (55 %) from the agroforestry component. Presently on average 23 %, 29 % and 41 % cattle were dependent on stall feeding in villages located at higher, lower and middle altitudes respectively. Similarly, fuel wood consumption was greatly influenced by altitude and family size. The efficiency and sustainability of the hill agroecosystem can be restored by strengthening of the agroforestry component. The approach will be appreciated by the local communities and will readily find their acceptance and can ensure their effective participation in the programme...|$|R
