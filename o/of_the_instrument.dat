5|$|Historian Jonathan Stock {{notes that}} the bent bow {{described}} in the poem above represents the arched bow used to play the huqin, while the sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> itself represented the discontent expressed by the prisoners-of-war with their defeated khan.|$|E
5|$|Idiophones, {{which produce}} sound by {{vibrating}} the primary body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> itself; they {{are sorted into}} concussion, percussion, shaken, scraped, split, and plucked idiophones, such as claves, xylophone, guiro, slit drum, mbira, and rattle.|$|E
5|$|After Mellotronics had {{targeted}} them as {{a potential}} customer, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop {{became interested in the}} possibilities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument,</b> hoping it would allow them to increase throughput. The corporation used two custom-made models that employed recorded sound effects throughout 1963 and 1964, but had problems with fluctuating tape speed and found the sound wasn't up to professional broadcast quality. The Mellotron was eventually dropped in favour of electronic oscillators and synthesizers.|$|E

5|$|Andre Schaeffner, {{a curator}} at the Musée de l'Homme, {{disagreed}} with the Hornbostel-Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel-Sachs, for example, divide aerophones {{on the basis of}} sound production, but membranophones {{on the basis of the}} shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument).</b> His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air.|$|E
5|$|Boosey & Hawkes' musical {{instruments}} division was gradually scaled {{down from the}} mid-1970s as it became less viable to have such an extensive range of products.

40|$|The dental assistants {{had already}} taken an {{important}} role in the dental clinic since several years ago because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four-handed dentistry. In America, there are lots of training courses for dental assistants. However, the education and formal trainings are very insufficient in Taiwan. Furthermore, the dental assistants maybe engaged as many different kinds <b>of</b> occupations before <b>the</b> dental clinics employ them. So there could be some troubles for dentists to communicate with new assistants. In order to solve these problems, we have developed an interactive multimedia e-learning system for dental clinic assistants. They can learn the basic knowledge from the system such as the Chinese and English names <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruments,</b> <b>the</b> pronunciation <b>of</b> English name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruments,</b> <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruments,</b> and <b>the</b> brief introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruments.</b> After a short time training, the new dental clinic assistants will have the ability to communicate with the dentists very easily.

30|$|Weak {{instruments}} {{can result}} in biased estimates in the second stage equation so {{it is important that}} the instruments’ relevance is tested. Since we have three endogenous variables there are various ways for testing <b>the</b> weakness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruments.</b> We thus present different F-tests to test <b>the</b> joint significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruments.</b> First, we test for <b>the</b> joint significance <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> in all <b>the</b> equations separately. For sons, the F-statistic for <b>the</b> joint significance <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> in <b>the</b> Paternal Schooling Equation is 10.51. The F-statistic for maternal schooling and paternal earnings are 13.11 and 23.71 respectively. Additionally, we present an F-test <b>of</b> <b>the</b> joint significance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> in <b>the</b> three equations simultaneously, which for the sons’ equation is 15.27. These statistics compare reasonably favorably with the Stock and Yogo (2002) suggested cut-off of around 10. Additionally, we present <b>the</b> modified F-statistic <b>of</b> Angrist and Pischke (2009) which is suggested for cases of multiple endogenous variables, and which partials out <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> on <b>the</b> other endogenous variables. These F-tests range from 6.24 to 35.45 for sons. There are no suggested critical values of this test but using the Stock and Yogo’s rule of thumb would suggest that <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> for education are somehow weak. We repeat the exercise for our favored specification, i.e. treating union membership as a control variable. We reach similar conclusions regarding <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruments</b> under this more strict exclusion restriction. These conclusions are similar for the estimates based on daughters.|$|R

5|$|The {{group was}} formed in 1967 by Emerson, Lee Jackson, David O'List and Ian Hague to back soul singer P. P. Arnold. After {{replacing}} Hague with Brian Davison, the group set out on their own, quickly developing a strong live following.

5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, {{the means by which}} music is produced with the instrument, the range <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument,</b> and the instrument's place in an orchestra or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group. The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible classification for each instrument. The most common types of instrument classifications are strings, brass, woodwind, and percussion.|$|E

The only differences, always <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> a personal decision, were <b>the</b> colour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> varnish, <b>the</b> height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ribs or <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instruments.</b>|$|R
5|$|Clarinets {{have the}} largest pitch range of common woodwinds. The {{intricate}} key organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range {{is defined by the}} keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>instrument</b> in question. The nominal highest note of the B clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest note of the oboe. Since the clarinet has a wider range of notes, the lowest note of the B clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe.|$|E
