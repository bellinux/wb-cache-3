5|$|As {{early as}} 2006, the Nashville Sounds {{had planned to}} leave Herschel Greer Stadium for a new {{ballpark}} to be called First Tennessee Field, but the project was abandoned after the city, developers, and team could not come to terms <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> finance its construction. Instead, Greer was repaired and upgraded to keep it close to Triple-A standards until a new stadium could be built. In late 2013, talks about {{the construction of a}} new ballpark—later called First Tennessee Park—were revived. Three possible sites were identified by the architectural firm Populous as being suitable for a new stadium: the east bank of the Cumberland River, the North Gulch area, and Sulphur Dell. Sulphur Dell, the site of the city's original ballpark from 1870 to 1963, was chosen.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds {{had planned}} to leave Greer Stadium in the mid 2000s for a new {{ballpark}} to be called First Tennessee Field, but the project was abandoned after the city, developers, and team could not come to terms <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> finance its construction. On October 30, 2008, following this failure to secure a new ballpark, Amerisports Companies LLC entered into an agreement to sell the Sounds to MFP Baseball, a New York-based group of investors consisting of Masahiro Honzawa, Steve Posner, and Frank Ward. Keeping the team in Nashville {{was one of the}} PCL's top criteria for approval of the sale. The transaction received final approval from Major League Baseball and the PCL on February 26, 2009. MFP made significant renovations to Greer Stadium while it continued to explore options for building a new downtown ballpark for the club.|$|E

5|$|During the {{afternoon}} that day, Egyptian Chief-of-Staff Saad el-Shazly arrived at Second Army Headquarters in Ismailia, at President Sadat's request. Shazly sought {{to assess the}} situation {{and to work with}} Khalil <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> counter the Israeli advance. They agreed to withdraw the 15th Armored Brigade from the east bank and keep it north of Ismailia as a reserve force, and to have Egyptian forces on the east bank attack southward to sever or at least narrow the Israeli corridor to the canal. Azmy's brigade meanwhile would continue defending the area south of the Ismailia Canal, and additional Sa'iqa units would be committed. Shazly also solved a major problem concerning anti-tank weaponry. Azmy's brigade was almost completely lacking anti-tank weapons; it had been stripped of its anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) battalion, equipped with AT-3 Saggers and RPG-7s, which was sent to the east bank to support the initial offensive. This battalion, and a second belonging to the 118th Infantry Brigade, were now withdrawn from the east bank throughout October 18 and brought back to their units. Shazly and Khalil carried out these orders in relative secrecy, as they were disobeying direct orders from Sadat and the Minister of War, Ahmed Ismail, not to withdraw any units from the east bank. Several measures decided upon were not implemented however.|$|E

25|$|At this point, Pichegru and Jourdan conferred <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> {{push the}} Austrians {{out of the}} region.Jourdan wanted to mass the two French armies near Mannheim, placing them between Clerfayt's army and a second Austrian army under General der Kavallerie Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser that was {{advancing}} from the south. Using the strategy of the central position, Jourdan hoped to defeat the Austrian armies one after the other. Pichegru rejected the plan, and both generals waited upon new orders from Paris. While they were waiting, Clerfayt took his Habsburg army south to block further moves by Pichegru against his Heidelberg base. In response, Jourdan ordered his army to move south to the Main River. This move completely isolated Mainz by surrounding it {{from both sides of}} the Rhine.|$|E
25|$|Vere decided <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> take {{advantage}} of the Spanish activity and this required the deployment of a body of English - 500 horse and 1,200 musketeers and pikemen, a force which was readily placed under his orders by Maurice. About two thirds of the way from the Anglo-Dutch camp there was a bridge over the broader road which Vere marched to early the next morning. He sent 200 light horse to attack the Spanish outposts and then retreat where they would be caught by the Spanish veterans. In the meantime he placed his infantry in ambush, one detachment close to the bridge, the other {{about a quarter of a}} mile further back, and the rest of his cavalry in the rear. Vere hoped he would be able to lure Parma's seasoned veterans of Spaniards and Italian Tercios into a fight.|$|E

The North Vietnamese operation would commence at 12.00am on April 9, 1975, to coincide with the North Vietnamese ground attack on Xuân Lộc and {{to take advantage of the}} hydrological patterns (low tide) in order to land the special forces on the South Vietnamese-occupied sections of the Spratly Islands.

On February 28, 2013, {{it was announced that}} a group consisting of representatives from the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, planners from the City of Buffalo, the Buffalo Sabres and NFTA are working <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> extend the southern terminus of the rail line just beyond the NFTA rail yard at the DL Terminal to a new parking garage being built near the Medical Campus. Without extended branches in the suburbs, the truncated system serves an average of 13,900 passengers daily as of 2014. As a useful transportation asset, Buffalo Metro Rail is ranked 25th in the nation in light rail daily ridership service as of 2013, with 5,058,300 passengers. One group, the Citizens Regional Transit Corporation (CRTC), advocates for expansion. As indicated in its statement, the CRTC seeks to educate the public, public officials, their authorities and agencies in the Buffalo-Niagara region about the benefits of a comprehensive transportation system including an expanded Metro Rail. In April 2011, the group stated that the 600 block of Main Street, which has Shea's Performing Arts Center along with hotels and bars, should be converted into a mixed automobile and rail system. The 600 block was re-opened to traffic in 2015.|$|E
