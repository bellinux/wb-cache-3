Making {{use of new}} micro-level data on <b>service</b> <b>imports</b> of German multinationals from 2002 - 2008, we assess the determinants of service offshoring along the extensive and intensive margins. In particular, we evaluate how internal frictions {{in terms of a}} sharp drop in the sales level (per employee) and external frictions in terms of a reduced availability of credit co-determine the likelihood and the extent of sourcing services from abroad. First, we find that firms are less likely to start to <b>import</b> <b>services</b> from abroad if they are under cost pressure. By contrast, firms intensify existing <b>service</b> <b>imports</b> linkages in times of a sales drop. Second, financial constraints, which played a major role for the goods trade during the crisis, did not have any significant effect on <b>service</b> <b>imports.</b> These results are in line with the argument that the generally observed crisis-resilience of service trade stems from increased pressures to save on variable costs through offshoring and from its lower dependence on external finance. Furthermore, and in line with our argument, we find that a decline in sales and labor productivity induces firms to sort into intra-firm rather than arm's-length trading...|$|R

40|$|Several {{developments}} {{in international trade}} in services impact strongly on developing countries: First, the world-wide diffusion of information technologies (IT) has created new export opportunities for developing countries in IT services. Second, the recently proclaimed Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction can only be attained if key services are provided more efficiently in developing countries - particularly through the liberalization of <b>service</b> <b>imports.</b> Third, in the ongoing Doha Development Round (DR) of trade negotiations, developing countries are asked to formally commit to liberalizing their <b>service</b> <b>imports</b> {{under the terms of}} the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). Developing countries will benefit from liberalizing <b>service</b> <b>imports</b> if liberalization enhances competition on the supply side. This is typically the case for producer services, such as domestic and international transport, financial services, and telecommunications. The lifting of restrictions on the market access by foreigners (including through direct investment) will often improve service quality or lower prices and thereby enhance the international competitiveness of downstream industries. In Doha Development Round negotiations, therefore, developing countries may find it useful to commit to liberalizing <b>imports</b> of producer <b>services.</b> By contrast, the benefits of import liberalization are less clear for some consumer services where supply is subject to network monopolies (e. g., water and energy distribution) or demand is constrained by poverty (health care, education). Here, achieving a socially optimal level of supply may require carefully calibrated government policies, possibly with international donor support. For developing countries, such sectors should not be priority areas for commitments on <b>service</b> <b>imports</b> under the GATS. Most service exports by developing countries, especially IT services transmitted electronically, face few import barriers in industrialized countries. However, under the GATS, service exports may also be delivered through temporary movement of natural persons, e. g., developing country nationals working in industrialized countries without becoming residents there. If Doha Development Round negotiations were to increase opportunities for such temporary labor migration, the benefits to developing countries could be huge. [...] ...|$|R

Estimation of a firm-level gravity model confirms that more productive firms offshore more, reveals complementarities between <b>services</b> <b>imports</b> and exports, and points towards the importance of intra-firm services trade. The paper establishes that the level of services offshoring is lower in industries with greater offshoring potentials, as captured by their task compositions, but offshoring growth tends to be higher there.

Both economies are export-oriented and actively court foreign direct investment (FDI) to advance their economic objectives of industrialisation and economic development.

The empirical findings for Singapore show evidence of bidirectional causality between inward FDI and the total trade volume in services (i. e. the absolute sum of payments and receipts) as well as between FDI and <b>services</b> <b>imports</b> (in the tri-variate specification). This may reflect her relative open foreign investment policy and free trade regime in services. For Malaysia, the evidence of causality is weaker and unidirectional, from inward FDI to <b>services</b> <b>imports.</b> These findings are consistent with the different stages of economic development and openness attained by the two sample countries, and they provide useful background for trade and foreign investment policies and development strategies.

Evidence from a sample of sixty-eight large manufacturing companies suggests that independent design consultancies and <b>other</b> design <b>service</b> vendors contribute significantly to the product development efforts of major corporations. External organizations are increasingly expected to deliver innovative design solutions with respect to materials selection, aesthetics, ergonomics, product performance, and ease of manufacture. These vendors vary from single-person establishments to firms that employ over 500 people. We find that the outsourcing of industrial design has been driven primarily by the ability of external companies to offer innovative services that complement the core competencies of client firms. Our data also point to the rising importance of design <b>service</b> <b>imports,</b> notably from the United Kingdom, France, and Italy.

The annual earnings of nonproduction workers relative to production workers increased steadily during this period, as did the ratio of nonproduction to production workers employed in U.
