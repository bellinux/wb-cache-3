5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of <b>our</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E

500|$|In May 2014, before Music Key {{service was}} launched, the {{independent}} music trade organization Worldwide Independent Network alleged that YouTube was using non-negotiable contracts with independent labels that were [...] "undervalued" [...] {{in comparison to}} other streaming services, and that YouTube would block all music content from labels who do not reach a deal to be included on the paid service. In {{a statement to the}} Financial Times in June 2014, Robert Kyncl confirmed that YouTube would block the content of labels who do not negotiate deals {{to be included in the}} paid service [...] "to ensure that all content on the platform is governed by its new contractual terms." [...] Stating that 90% of labels had reached deals, he went on to say that [...] "while we wish that we had [...] 100% success rate, we understand that is not likely an achievable goal and therefore it is <b>our</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> our users and the industry to launch the enhanced music experience." [...] The Financial Times later reported that YouTube had reached an aggregate deal with Merlin Network—a trade group representing over 20,000 independent labels, for their inclusion in the service.

2500|$|Despite this, {{the details}} of our values and ethics are not inherited: they are partly {{determined}} by our culture, and partly chosen by ourselves. Morality and duty are often at war with natural instincts; ethics cannot be derived from the struggle for existence: [...] "Of moral purpose I see not a trace in nature. That is an article of exclusively human manufacture." [...] It is therefore <b>our</b> <b>responsibility</b> <b>to</b> make ethical choices (see Ethics and Evolutionary ethics). This seems to put Huxley as a compatibilist in the Free Will vs Determinism debate. In this argument Huxley is diametrically opposed to his old friend Herbert Spencer.|$|E
