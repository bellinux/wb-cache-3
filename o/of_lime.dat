5|$|Amanita onusta may be {{confused}} with A.cinereoconia because of the similar gray powdery veil remnants on the cap surface. A.cinereoconia is distinguished from A.onusta {{by the absence of}} clamps, its powdery-wooly to powdery-warty cap, as well as the absence of warts or scales {{at the base of the}} stipe. A.cinereoconia also smells distinctly of chloride <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> Another similar species is A.costaricensis, found only in Costa Rica. A.atkinsoniana, another North American species, has shorter warts that are spaced further apart than those of A.onusta, and the warts on the basal bulb are arranged in parallel rows.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, most glacial {{acetic acid}} was {{obtained}} from the pyroligneous liquor, a product of the distillation of wood. The acetic acid was isolated by treatment with milk <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> and the resulting calcium acetate was then acidified with sulfuric acid to recover acetic acid. At that time, Germany was producing 10,000 tons of {{glacial acetic acid}}, around 30% of which was used for the manufacture of indigo dye.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, one John Holland of Cincinnati {{discovered}} {{the ability to}} melt and make castings of iridium by fusing the white-hot ore with phosphorus, and patented the process in the United States. He invoked the help of Dudley in {{getting rid of the}} phosphorus, who did so by repeated applications <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> at great heat. This was the first reported method of refining iridium. Dudley then found new applications for iridium, and formed the American Iridium Company with Holland. Dudley filed a patent on his method for iridium electroplating in 1887.|$|E
5|$|On {{the desert}} planet, the search begins for a {{suitable}} source <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> to filter {{the air on}} Destiny. The sand itself has a small concentration of calcite, {{but not enough to}} be useful, so the team starts looking for a dry lake bed, which should have heavy deposits <b>of</b> <b>lime.</b> The group splits into two: Rush, Scott and Ronald Greer (Jamil Walker Smith) form one group, while Wallace leads the remainder in a different direction. After several failed tests, those in Wallace's group give up on the search, instead intending to try out the Stargate addresses the Destiny rejected. When Wallace informs the others, Scott sends Rush and Greer back to stop them while he continues searching. They make it back in time to stop Franklin (Mark Burgess), the member carrying the dialing remote, but the other two make it through. Rush is vehemently against the idea of exploring the other addresses, believing that the ship locked them out for a reason, and several failed attempts to contact the two lost expedition members seem to support his concerns.|$|E

The surfaces were finished by painting with a thin coat of mortar and silane to resist further erosion and attack by pollutants. The restoration of the façade revealed much paint adhering to the statues and their niches, indicating that it had once been brightly coloured.|$|E

5|$|Both Steep Holm and Flat Holm were {{fortified}} in the 1860s as a defence against invasion. They {{form part}} {{of a line of}} defences, known as Palmerston Forts, built across the channel to protect the approaches to Bristol and Cardiff. The island was fortified following a visit by Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to France, where they had been concerned at the strength of the French Navy. The Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom, under the direction of Lord Palmerston, recommended fortification of the coast, and the island formed part of this strategic coastal defence system. Construction began in 1865 and was completed in 1869 by John Perry of Weston-super-Mare. The work involved the creation of a perimeter road around the summit plateau and a lime kiln for the manufacture <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> mortar to build the barracks and gun emplacements with their ammunition stores.|$|E
5|$|Casa Álvarez-Buiza, {{a private}} house and {{commercial}} complex, {{was built in}} the San Juan district by Adel Franco Pinna between 1918–2. The building located on the Plaza de La Soledad once housed the offices of the Bank of Spain. Artistic elements include the use <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> brick and colorful ceramics with an Andalusian influence. Casa del Cordón is a private house, built in the late Gothic style of the early 16th century, and has mullioned windows. It currently houses the Archdiocese. Casa Puebla, built in 1921, is one of the other designs of Pinna, who designed numerous buildings around Badajoz. It {{is one of the best}} examples of regional architecture in Andalusian style and the property has two facades, the main one featuring neo-Renaissance elements.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Old Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had {{developed}} a glassy material known as faience, which they treated {{as a type of}} artificial semi-precious stone. Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> and soda, and a colorant, typically copper. The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares. Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials {{in the form of a}} paste over a clay core, which was then fired. By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian Blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron. The product can be ground up and used as a pigment.|$|E

5|$|The Triassic rocks {{consist of}} red marls, sandstones, breccias and {{conglomerates}} which {{spread over the}} older rocks. The Dolomitic Conglomerate is an old shingle beach of Keuper Marl age. The Rhaetic Beds are full of fossils due to invasion of the Jurassic Sea. The Lias consists of clays and limestones, the latter being quarried and are famous for their fossils. Blue Lias was burnt locally to provide a source <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> for making lime mortar. It is still used as a decorative building stone. Blue Lias {{is believed to have}} been quarried on the Polden Hills as early as the 15th century and was quarried in Puriton from the early 19th century until 1973, when the local cement works closed.|$|E
5|$|The castle's {{foundations}} {{rested on}} the underlying shingle of the beach. The walls were made from Kentish ragstone, mostly roughly laid, with some work using finer ashlar, with Caen stone used in the detailing. Most of the ragstone was collected from the local beaches, where there were suitable outcrops {{to the west and}} east of the site. 459 tons of Caen stone was recycled from the priories of Christ Church and Horton, which had recently been dissolved by Henry. In total, 147,000 bricks were used, produced at 13 different brickyards, and 44,000 tiles, mostly manufactured in Wye, along with 1,829 loads <b>of</b> <b>lime,</b> 110 tons of coal and 979 tons of timber. The total cost of the project came to £5,584.|$|E
5|$|The former fishing {{hamlet of}} Holywell (local {{pronunciation}} ‘holly well’) was situated by the cliff on a ledge some 400 {{yards to the}} southwest of the public garden known as the Holywell Retreat.

The ground around the pinnacle was the site <b>of</b> <b>lime</b> kilns also worked by the fishermen. The fishing hamlet at Holywell was taken over by the local water board in 1896 to exploit the springs in the cliffs. The water board's successors still own the site, and there is a pumping station but little evidence of the hamlet itself, as by now even most of the foundations of the cottages have gone over the cliff.|$|E
