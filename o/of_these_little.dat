500|$|The Catechism classifies scandal {{under the}} fifth commandment and defines it as [...] "an {{attitude}} or behavior which leads another to do evil". In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus stated, [...] "Whoever causes one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> ones {{who believe in}} me to sin, {{it would be better}} for him to have a great millstone fastened round his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea." [...] The Church considers it a serious crime to cause another's faith, hope and love to be weakened, especially if it is done to young people and the perpetrator is a person of authority such as a parent, teacher or priest.|$|E
500|$|William Robinson and Gertrude Jekyll {{helped to}} popularise less formal gardens in their many books and {{magazine}} articles. Robinson's The Wild Garden, published in 1870, {{contained in the}} first edition an essay on [...] "The Garden of British Wild Flowers", which was eliminated from later editions. In his The English Flower Garden, illustrated with cottage gardens from Somerset, Kent and Surrey, he remarked, [...] "One lesson <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> gardens, that are so pretty, is that one can get good effects from simple materials." [...] From the 1890s his lifelong friend Jekyll applied cottage garden principles to more structured designs in even quite large country houses. Her Colour in the Flower Garden (1908) is still in print today.|$|E

Moore mentioned that [...] "he whole thing with Watchmen {{has just been}} loads <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>little</b> bits of synchronicity popping {{up all over the}} place". Gibbons noted an unintended theme was contrasting the mundane and the romantic, citing the separate sex scenes between Nite Owl and Silk Spectre on his couch and then high in the sky on Nite Owl's airship. In a book of the craters and boulders of Mars, Gibbons discovered a photograph of the Galle crater, which resembles a happy face, which they worked into an issue. Moore said, [...] "We found {{a lot of these things}} started to generate themselves as if by magic", in particular citing an occasion where they decided to name a lock company the [...] "Gordian Knot Lock Company".|$|E

2500|$|Crow {{folklore}} {{says the}} [...] "Little People" [...] {{live in the}} Pryor Mountains, a small mountain range in Carbon County, Montana and Bighorn County, Montana. Petroglyphs on rocks in the mountains, the Crow said, were made by these demon-like creatures. Because the Little People live there, the mountains are sacred to the Crow. The Little People {{are said to be}} no more than [...] (or knee) high. Crow folklore differs slightly from that of other tribes in describing the Little People of the Pryor Mountains as having large, nearly round bellies; incredibly strong but short arms and legs; and little or no neck. In the story of [...] "Lost Boy" [...] (or [...] "Burnt Face"), the Crow told of a Little Person who killed a full-grown bull elk and carried it off just by tossing the elk's head over its shoulder. The Crow expression, [...] "strong as a dwarf," [...] references the incredible strength <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>Little</b> People. However, they are incredibly fierce warriors, feed primarily on meat, and have many sharp, canine-like teeth in their mouths. Nearby tribes told stories of the Little People tearing the hearts out of their enemies' horses, stories which may have helped keep these tribes from making war on the Crow. Each year, the Crow made an offering to the Little People at Medicine Rocks (also known as [...] "Castle Rocks"), where they believed some Little People lived. The Pryor Mountains Little People were also known for stealing children, food, medicine, and tobacco. The Crow also believed that the Little People created stone arrowheads, for the Crow themselves only knew how to make bone arrowheads. Anyone who tried to play a trick on the Little People would incur their wrath, which usually destroyed him and his entire family.|$|E
