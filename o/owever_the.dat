The P-ketoacyl ACP synthase (KAS) III (mtFabH) is proposed to link FAS-I and FAS- 11, catalyzing the condensation of FAS- 1 -derived acyl-CoA with malonyl-Acyl Carrier Protein (ACP).

The substitution of residues implicated in acyl-CoA chain length specificity totally abrogated overall KAS activity and reduced the transacylation activity of the enzyme. Mutation of the proposed catalytic triad residues confirmed that Cys 122 is essential for transacylation and His 258 is essential for malonyl-AcpM decarboxylation. KasA, which belongs to the FAS- 11 system, utilises palmitoyl-ACP rather than short-chain acyl-ACP primers. Purified recombinant KasA had in vitro KAS activity that was highly sensitive to cerulenin, a well-known KAS inhibitor. Mutation of proposed catalytic residues Cys 17 1, His 31 1, Lys 340 and His 345 inactivated the enzyme completely. Four putative accD genes were found in Corynebacterium glutamicum. Overexpression of each gene resulted in increased acyl-CoA dependent 14 CO 2 fixation in vitro, providing evidence that the accD genes encode a family of carboxyltransferases. Disruption of either accD 2 or accD 3 led to complete and specific loss of mycolic acids.

40|$|Tobacco {{epidemic}} {{is described as}} a global crisis, {{it is one of the}} two major causes of death and still growing, the other one being HIV/AIDS. The number of smokers worldwide is estimated to be 1. 3 billion people, 84 % of these smokers live in developing countries. Cigarette smoking, consumption of other tobacco products and passive smoking are the world leading preventable causes responsible for about 5 million deaths a year, mostly in poor countries and poor populations. Young adults most of which are in secondary schools are at a higher risk of contracting problems caused by tobacco use; this is due in part to inadequate knowledge about health effects caused by tobacco use and also there is a lot of material in the media that glorify smoking. In Tanzania especially Dar-es-Salaam, there is reported a 1. 6 % revalence rate amongst secondary school pupils. To determine the socio-environmental factors that may influence smoking amongst secondary school pupils in Ilala municipality in Dar-es-Salaam. This was a cross sectional descriptive study that involved 260 respondents selected randomly from fiverandomly selected secondary schools. A Swahili structured close ended questionnaire were used in datacollection and the study was carried in between March and April, 2007. Data coding was done during data entry & quantitative data analysis was done through SPSS Version 12. 0, a computer package programme, ereas qualitative data sociological/anthropological methods in data analysis were used. The results revealed that 14. 2 % of the pupils reported to have ever smoked and the range of age to smoke the first cigarette were between 6 to 20 years with a mean age of 17 years. About 2 % were current smokers. Most of the pupils (88 %) declared smoking as not normal for young people, owing to the harmful effects that are contributed by cigarette smoking.

A decision tree is a predictive model which can be used to represent both classifiers and regre- ssion models. In operations research, a decision trees refers to a hierarchical model of decisions and their consequences. When decision tree are used as a classification tasks, it is more appro- priately referred to as a classification tree. Classification trees are used to classify an object, or an instance, to a predefined set of classes based on their attribute’s value. These trees are frequently used in applied fields such as: finance, marketing, engineering, and medicine. They are useful as an exploratory technique.

40|$|The city of Erie, Pennsylvania {{represents}} an anomalous {{case in the}} dialect geography of North America. According to all available historical records, it was linguistically aligned with the North {{in the early part}} of the 20 th century: the lexical data presented in Kurath (1949) and Carver (1987) locate Erie within most of the Northern isoglosses, and the phonological data presented in Kurath and McDavid (1961) show that Erie shared nearly all of its phonological features with the North and only a few with the Midland. However, recent research for the Atlas of North American English (Labov et al. 2006) shows that Erie is now a Midland city, and the two ANAE speakers from Erie show no traces of the Northern Cities Shift. Crucially, the two pivot points in the vowel system, as defined by Labov (1991), show clear Midland characteristics: short-a exhibits raising before all nasals, but not the general raising of the NCS, and both speakers have a complete merger of the vowels in cot and caught. Erie’s shift from being a Northern city to a Midland city is surprising given that the North/Midland boundary is the most clearly defined dialect boundary in North America today (Labov et al. 2006). Furthermore, it would not be predicted by dialect diffusion models that only take population and distance into account, such as Trudgill’s (1974) Gravity Model: Buffalo and Cleveland, the large Northern Cities along Lake Erie on either side of Erie are more populous and closer to Erie than Pittsburgh, the nearest large Midland city. The current study provides a more detailed characterization of Erie, and presents vowel measurements from seven Erieites, ranging in age from 25 to 60. I n general, the results confirm ANAE’s finding that Erie is aligned with the Midland. H <b>owever,</b> <b>the</b> vowels systems of the Erie speakers are different from the neighboring Midland speakers in two respects. First of all, /ow/ does not participate in the strong fronting that is characteristic of Pittsburgh/Western PA: only the youngest speaker (a 25 -year-old female) shows an F 2 value for /ow/ that is higher than would be expected for a Northern speaker. Furthermore, while all speakers clearly have the low-back merger, the phonetic realization of the resulting phoneme is unrounded and lower than the distinctly rounded and raised open-o of the Pittsburgh area. Thus, while Erie is clearly phonologically aligned with Pittsburgh, the two regions are not phonetically identical. This realignment with the Midland suggests that Pittsburgh has had a stronger influence on Erie since the middle of the 20 th century than either of the two large nearby Northern cities. Qualitative evidence from sociolinguistic interviews will be presented to confirm this and to show that Erieites have more contact with speakers from Pittsburgh than either Buffalo or Cleveland. Much of this contact stems from the popularity of Erie as a summer vacation destination for residents of Pittsburgh, evidenced by the fact that some Erieites refer to these summer vacationers from Pittsburgh as 2 ̆ 2 mups 2 ̆ 2 (from 2 ̆ 2 come up 2 ̆ 2). It will be argued that this higher density of communication caused Erie to shift its phonological allegiance from the North to the Midland, and, consequently, that any model of dialect diffusion must take communication patterns into account in order to be fully explanatory...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} decades, the food {{industry}} has put in much effort to pos itively contribute to animal and human health using functional foods suc h as prebiotics. Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients that ben eficially affect the host by selectively stimulating the growth and/or a ctivity {{of one or more}} types of favourable bacteria such as bifidobacter ia and lactobacilli. Fermentation of prebiotics stimulates the saccharolytic activity of the colonic microbiota resulting in the production of short chain fatty acid s (acetic acid, butyric acid and propionic acid). To the contrary, prote olytic activity is reduced with less production of potentially toxic met abolites (phenols, sulfides and amines). Until now, fructo-oligosacchari des and inulin are well-established prebiotics, whereas other non-digest ible carbohydrates such as xylo-, galacto- isomalto- and soybean-oligosa ccharides have been considered as candidate prebiotics. Recently, arabinoxylan-oligosaccharides (AXOS) have been proposed as a n ew prebiotic substrate by the Laboratory of Food Chemistry and Biochemis try (Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, K. U. Leuven). AXOS consist of a x ylopyranosyl backbone which is substituted with arabinofuranosyl residue s. They are produced by enzymatic degradation of arabinoxylans (AX), a c ereal dietary fibre. Through their high viscosity and water-binding capa city, AX {{have a positive impact on}} the functionality of cereals in biote chnological food processes such as bread-making and pasta-making. AX do not exert prebiotic properties since they are only partly fermented in t he colon. Depending on the substrate specificity of the endo- and exo-en zymes, AXOS with variable average degree of polymerisation (avDP) and av erage degree of arabinose substitution (avDAS) are obtained. Based upon experimental animal studies, performed at the Laboratory of F ood Chemistry and Biochemistry, low doses of AXOS have been demonstrated to have prebiotic activity. In humans, however, the effect of AXOS on t he colonic metabolism and fermentation pattern was largely unknown. The present research project aimed to characterise the influence of AXOS on the human gastrointestinal tract. Parameters of proximal motility an d digestion have been measured to evaluate the effects of AXOS on the pr oximal part of the gastrointestinal tract. To examine the prebiotic acti vity of AXOS, we studied the influence of AXOS on the composition of the microbiota as well as the metabolic activity of the microbiota. The bio marker lactose-[15 N, 15 N]-ureide has been used to study the colonic ammo nia metabolism. The intake of prebiotics results in a larger fraction of [15 N]-NH 3 being taken up by the bacteria and excreted in faeces and a s maller fraction of the label being excreted in urine. Urinary p-cresol a nd phenol excretion were measured as an indication of protein fermentati on. Furthermore, bacterial enzyme activities and faecal volatile organic compounds were analysed as parameters of the colonic bacterial metaboli sm. To study the effects of AXOS on these different gastrointestinal par ameters, several dietary intervention studies were performed in healthy subjects. In Chapter III. 1, a preliminary study was performed in which AXOS was ad ministered for the first time to healthy subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the minimal dose of AXOS with an avDP of 15 and an avDA S of 0. 27 (AXOS- 15 - 0. 27) that causes a detectable effect on the colonic metabolism. Therefore, single doses of AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 ranging between 0. 0 g and 5. 0 g were administered. The increased hydrogen excretion upon a dos e of 2. 2 g demonstrated that AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 is fermented by the bacteria in the colon. Gastric emptying rate, oro-caecal transit and total transit were not influenced by the administration of AXOS- 15 - 0. 27. Upon a dose o f 2. 2 g AXOS- 15 - 0. 27, a decrease in urinary 15 N-excretion was observed al ong with an increase of 15 N in faeces. These results indicated a stimula tion of bacterial activity and, consequently, a higher uptake of 15 N by the bacteria. These findings suggested that a minimal dose of 2. 2 g AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 favourably modulates the colonic bacterial metabolism. Subsequently, we evaluated the influence of 2. 2 g AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 on proxima l motility and nutrient digestion (Chapter III. 2). This study was necess ary to exclude that changes in transit and digestion through supplementa tion of prebiotics affect the supply of substrates to the colon and thus influence the fermentation process. We established that a low dose of A XOS- 15 - 0. 27 did not influence the supply of proteins and lipids to the c olon. Therefore, we assumed that the observed influences of AXOS on colo nic metabolism were not due to differences in proximal motility and dige stion, yet, could be attributed to events occurring in the colon. In Chapter III. 3, two placebo-controlled, randomised, cross-over studies were performed to investigate the gastrointestinal effects of AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 and placebo. In the first study, the substrates were administered fo r two weeks in a dose of 2. 2 g/d, whereas the dose was increased to 5. 0 g/ d in the second study. In both studies, the colonic ammonia metabolism, protein fermentation and bacterial enzyme activity remained unchanged. H <b>owever,</b> <b>the</b> levels of bifidobacteria were increased after administration of 5. 0 g/d AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 for 2 weeks, indicating the prebiotic potential of AXOS- 15 - 0. 27 in healthy humans. Chapter III. 4 describes the results of a randomised, cross-over study in which the influence of AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 on several gastrointestinal paramete rs was compared to those of the reference prebiotic fructo-oligosacchari de enriched inulin (FOS-IN). In the presence of 5. 0 g/d AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 or FO S-IN, a clear effect on colonic ammonia metabolism was observed. The lev els of bifidobacteria were slightly increased after a 2 -weeks intake per iod of AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 or FOS-IN. Because of the positive effects on colonic metabolism and microbiota observed in this study, we performed a second study with a reduced dose (2. 2 g/d) of AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 and FOS-IN. This dose did not influence the colonic ammonia metabolism. However, the levels o f bifidobacteria were significantly increased. In both studies, protein fermentation and bacterial enzyme activities were not changed. Obviously, the effects of AXOS- 9 - 0. 26 and FOS-IN were very similar at the same do ses. We also concluded that changes in microbiota were not necessarily a ssociated with changes in the colonic metabolism. In a next study, a higher dose of AXOS (10. 0 g/d) was administered to the subjects. Again, we evaluated their influence on different gastrointest inal parameters as well as the tolerance of AXOS (Chapter III. 5). Theref ore, we performed a placebo-controlled, randomised, cross-over study in which 10. 0 g/d AXOS- 6 - 0. 26 was administered to healthy subjects for 3 wee ks. The intake of AXOS- 6 - 0. 26 did not cause biologically relevant change s in haematological and clinical chemistry parameters. Furthermore, the total symptom score was only slightly increased. Urinary p-cresol excret ion was significantly decreased, whereas bifidobacteria levels were sign ificantly increased after intake of AXOS- 6 - 0. 26. These results show that AXOS is well-tolerated in healthy subjects. In addition, protein fermen tation was influenced at these relatively high doses. To accurately characterise the bacterial colonic metabolism, metabolite profiling of volatile organic components from faeces was applied (Chapte r III. 6). Faecal samples collected during the intervention studies descr ibed in Chapter III. 4 and III. 5 were analysed. Multivariate data analysi s allowed discrimination of the faecal samples collected after intake of 5. 0 g/d AXOS- 9 - 0. 26, 10. 0 g/d AXOS- 6 - 0. 26 or 5. 0 g/d FOS-IN from the sampl es collected at baseline on the basis of a different metabolite pattern. The results indicate that this technique of metabolite profiling is a p romising tool to study the influence of dietary interventions. During the execution of the project, a considerable variability was obse rved in the biomarkers used to evaluate the colonic metabolism (urinary p-cresol and phenol excretion, and 15 N-excretion). Therefore, the repeat ability of these biomarkers was evaluated in the last chapter (Chapter I II. 7). From the results, we concluded that the repeatability of the para meters was acceptable and that the observed variability was not due to i ncomplete urine collections nor to variability in dietary intake. In general, we concluded that AXOS is also in humans a carbohydrate with prebiotic activity. Additional research is necessary to further unravel the structure activity pattern of different types of AXOS preparations and to elucidate the relation between microbiota and their metabolic act ivity. status: publishe...|$|E
