One room contained a custom made bath which was sometimes filled with champagne; and a specially designed and crafted siège d'amour (love seat) that allowed easy access for oral {{and other forms of}} sex for two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people.</b> It is now a museum piece.|$|E
25|$|Representative Jane Harman, a California Democrat and Chairman of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Intelligence, Information Sharing, and Terrorism Risk Assessment, said Pakistani {{officials}} arrested “alleged facilitators” {{as part of}} a “far broader investigation.” Pakistani authorities arrested {{more than}} a dozen suspects in the investigation of the attempted car bombing, including two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> at a house in Karachi's Nazimabad district where Shahzad is said to have stayed.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the Mark C was {{available}} only as either the Standard Tourer or the Deluxe Tourer {{with a single}} bench seat, seating two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people.</b> The Deluxe version included an electric starter along with rear bumpers. The range was expanded in March 1954, when the Standard Family Safety and Deluxe Family Safety versions were added. On these models the bodywork was extended behind the front seat and, like the earlier Bond Family Safety Saloon, two child-size inward facing hammock-style seats were added in the gap. Factory advertising material resurrected the Safety label {{as part of this}} model's name, but it was generally dropped elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Until his death, Borel {{attended}} the lycée professionnel Georges-Cisson in Toulon, {{where he studied}} electromechanics and did quite well academically. He {{was said to be}} a disciplined and quiet student. However, in his last year at school there was a radical change in behavior. He skipped classes without permission or explanation and became unaffable. He regularly said that he could not bear it anymore at home, that he had had enough of doing housework and being called names, and often stated his wish to join the military, like his father and grandfather. Apparently, the week prior to the shooting, he also told one of his classmates that he would commit suicide, but not before killing two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people.</b>|$|E
25|$|It was at Southern, in {{the same}} year he joined the station, that Hargreaves made his screen debut with the series Gone Fishing – and so, what had {{previously}} been a pastime became the focus of his wider reputation. He recounted how on his first broadcast, sitting in the studio, apprehensive at the thought of being about to talk live to a potential audience of millions, his director had reminded him that although that vast audience might be statistically daunting, it was more likely to be two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> and perhaps a dog sitting in their front room. He aimed at conversing with such an audience {{for the rest of his}} career. The director of nearly all of Hargreaves' programmes at Southern Television was George Egan who, with cameraman Stan Bréhaut, became the third ingredient of a most creative outdoor team.|$|E
25|$|While many {{witnesses}} {{said that the}} Fanchers were in general a peaceful party whose members behaved well along the trail, rumors spread about aggressive and threatening behavior and other misdeeds. Brevet Major James Henry Carleton led the first federal investigation of the murders, published in 1859. He recorded Hamblin's account that the train was alleged to have poisoned a spring near Corn Creek; this resulted {{in the deaths of}} 18 head of cattle and two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> who ate the contaminated meat. Carleton interviewed the father of a child who allegedly died from this poisoned spring, and accepted the sincerity of the grieving father. But, he also included a statement from an investigator who did not believe the Fancher party was capable of poisoning the spring, given its size. Carleton invited readers to consider a potential explanation for the rumors of misdeeds, noting the general atmosphere of distrust among Mormons for strangers at the time, and that some locals appeared jealous of the Fancher party's wealth.|$|E

500|$|Filming {{took place}} in Vancouver and at the Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam from October 2011 to March 2012. For the first season, {{production}} {{took place in}} Hamilton and Toronto. Noah Wyle said that the change in location made filming significantly different. A new crew came in for the second season, with only [...] "two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> on staff that were there in season one." [...] The new staff includes a new writing staff and showrunner.|$|E
500|$|Meerkat Manor {{normally}} films episodes using {{a crew of}} {{only two}} <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> to avoid disturbing the meerkats; the film was shot over two years at the Kuruman River Reserve, where the Kalahari Meerkat Project that the meerkats {{are a part of}} is based, and employed a much larger crew. Breaking from the series' pure documentary format, the film does not include footage of the project meerkats depicted in the story. Instead, wild meerkat [...] "actors" [...] represented Flower and her family; Flower was depicted by approximately eight female meerkats. The camera crew sought out appropriately aged meerkats for each scene, then filmed them until they behaved in ways the script required.|$|E
500|$|A {{tropical}} depression formed on October29 near Pohnpei. It {{moved to the}} northeast initially, but on October31 began tracking to the west. On November3, the system passed just south of Guam as a typhoon, where a pressure of [...] was recorded. Winds reached over 200km/h (125mph), {{and there was a}} slight decrease during the passage of the eyewall. The typhoon turned to the northwest, passing near the Bonin Islands. On November8, the typhoon accelerated to the northeast, crossing the International Date Line on November10. When the storm struck Guam, it damaged nearly every building on the island. Most of the damage occurred after the center of the storm passed and the onslaught of easterly winds began. The storm also damaged the Pan American tourist hotel and a hangar. Downed trees killed two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people,</b> and five people in total died on the island, the others likely due to drowning. After the storm, Naval Governor George McMillin sought aid from the American Red Cross to assist residents in rebuilding. It was considered among the worst typhoons on record in Guam.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the more}} notable events during the {{recording}} of Wish You Were Here occurred on 5 June 1975, the day Gilmour married his first wife, Ginger, {{on the eve of}} Pink Floyd's second US tour that year. [...] The band {{were in the process of}} completing the final mix of [...] "Shine On You Crazy Diamond" [...] when an overweight man with shaven head and eyebrows, and holding a plastic bag, entered the room. [...] Waters, who was working in the studio, initially did not recognise him. [...] Wright was also mystified by the identity of the visitor, presumed he was a friend of Waters' and asked him, but soon realised that it was Syd Barrett. [...] Gilmour initially presumed he was an EMI staff member. Mason also failed to recognise him and was [...] "horrified" [...] when Gilmour identified him. [...] In Mason's personal memoir of Pink Floyd, , he recalled Barrett's conversation as [...] "desultory and not entirely sensible". Storm Thorgerson later reflected on Barrett's presence: [...] "Two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> cried. [...] He sat round and talked for a bit but he wasn't really there." ...|$|E
500|$|The use of fake weapons {{generated}} controversy. After {{the concert}} in Colorado, Madonna was criticised {{over the use}} of fake weapons, since the public was sensitized by the 2012 Aurora shooting, which occurred at the premiere of The Dark Knight Rises. Peter Burns, a radio broadcaster in the region, told The Hollywood Reporter that [...] "You could see people kinda looking at each other. I heard the word 'Colorado', you know, 'Aurora', 'shooting'. You could hear people talking about it, and it was little bit unsettling. I saw two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> get up and grab their stuff and actually leave their seats". Ray Mark Rinaldi from Reverb website said that Madonna was [...] "dancing with guns and shooting up bad guys during 'Revolver'. It was a bloody scene, particularly tasteless in Colorado these days, but all cartoon; if folks got upset, they were supposed to". Daniel Brokman from The Phoenix said: [...] "Madonna took the capacity crowd into a dark place that few were expecting minutes earlier from this queen of '80s pop music". In a review of the concert, Ross Raihala from Twin Cities mentioned that there was [...] "darkness hung over much {{of the first half of}} the show" [...] because of the performances of [...] "Revolver" [...] and [...] "Gang Bang." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Cover the Night" [...] event {{took place}} {{worldwide}} on April 20, 2012 and {{was to be}} conducted by supporters who were encouraged to perform some sort of charity work that morning in their local community. Then, that evening, they were to post flyers and posters throughout their city for the Kony 2012 campaign. The turnout for the event worldwide was much smaller than initially expected, with no organized spots officially announced and much fewer people attending than had pledged to attend. A tweet from Invisible Children stated, [...] "There is no official meet-up as we are asking people to act locally with friends+family [...] in their neighborhoods." [...] One gathering in Vancouver had only 17 people; another in Brisbane had fewer than 50 attendees. In Kelowna, British Columbia several signs and posters were put up, including two large banners that were [...] "placed {{on both sides of}} the pedestrian overpass". In Canberra, several Facebook groups resulted in a few gatherings of two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> each; Pierre Johannessen, a [...] "law firm partner who runs a charity for disadvantaged children", distributed around 3,000 posters to the groups to be put up throughout the city. In Phoenix, 200 posters were put up by [...] "college students and other people in their teens and 20s", along with a number of chalk and stencil messages.|$|E

[...] Novel and exotic new materials, such as bamboo, papier-mâché, and rattan, were used {{for the first time in}} European furniture, along with polychrome wood, and wood painted with black lacquer.

I was puzzled by that until I added up the entries themselves. Some of them were interviews with two <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>people</b> [...] lived in the same apartment. I believe that some harried civil servant gave that number to the police commissioner who gave it to Rosenthal, and it entered the modern history of America after that.|$|E
