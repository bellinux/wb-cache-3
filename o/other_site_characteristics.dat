Aquifer storage, transfer and recovery (ASTR), using a seasonal surplus of potable water, is being tested as a potential low-cost (less than $ 8000 USD) water supply alternative for these communities. A variable-density numerical groundwater model was developed to investigate the engineering technical feasibility of small-scale ASTR systems for the coastal communities in Bangladesh and specifically to support future field site selection and system design.

A number of conceptual and methodological problems that impinge on all evaluations of regeneration policies have constrained the required evidence base. This paper evaluates the impact of publicly funded physical improvements of run-down industrial sites in the Netherlands and seeks to address several of these challenges; namely, selecting appropriate comparison areas, attributing change to specific interventions, access to small-scale, longitudinal data and selecting outcomes congruent with policy goals and rationales.

Woodland caribou may minimize predation risk during calving by either spacing out or spacing away from predators in the forest to calve on islands, wetlands, or shorelines. Our objective was to determine the characteristics of shoreline habitats used as calving and nursery sites by female woodland caribou in northern Ontario. Detailed vegetation and <b>other</b> <b>site</b> <b>characteristics</b> were measured at nursery sites used by cow-calf pairs in Wabakimi and Woodland Caribou Provincial Parks for comparison with shoreline sites that were not used by caribou within each park. Differences in habitat variables selected by female caribou in the two study areas reflect broad ecoregional differences in vegetation and topography. In Wabakimi Provincial Park, understorey tree density and ground detection distance played key roles in distinguishing nursery sites from sites that were not used. In Woodland Caribou Provincial Park, groundcover vegetation and shrub density were important in the selection of nursery sites by female caribou. Generally, female caribou in both parks selected nursery sites with greater slope, lower shrub density but thicker groundcover vegetation, including greater lichen abundance, and higher densities of mature trees than shoreline sites that were not used. The identification of these important features for caribou nursery sites provides a basis for improving their protection in future management policies and legislation...|$|E

40|$|Accident {{prediction}} models (APMs) {{are very}} useful tools for estimating the expected number of accidents on entities such as intersections and road sections. These estimates are typically {{used in the}} identification of sites for possible safety treatment and in the evaluation of such treatments. An APM is, in essence, a mathematical equation that expresses the average accident frequency of a site as a function of traffic flow and <b>other</b> <b>site</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The reliability of an APM estimate is enhanced if the APM is based on data for as many years as possible especially if data for those same years are used in the safety analysis of a site.

To capture this variation, the count for each year is treated as a separate observation. Unfortunately, the disaggregation of the data in this manner creates a temporal correlation that presents difficulties for traditional model calibration procedures.

This is a plausible mechanism for stimulating buckbrush seed germination in our study sites, as maximum surface soil temperatures in gaps between shrubs (68.5 °C; Duren 2009) were comparable to temperatures known to significantly increase seed germination of this species (Keeley 1987). Germination stimulants of sticky whiteleaf manzanita are less well understood (e.g., Kauffman and Martin 1991, Keeley 1991), and mechanisms for recruitment of this species {{in the absence of}} fire are uncertain. Recruitment {{did not appear to be}} related to factors likely to influence soil heating or seedling water stress (Duren 2009), or to potential livestock disturbance. Young stands (< 30 yr since fire) with relatively high shrub density lacked fire-free recruits, but two older stands with relatively low shrub density and, presumably, more opportunities for soil heating, also lacked such recruits. We found no relationship between even-agedness and <b>other</b> <b>site</b> <b>characteristics,</b> which, along with the predominance of older uneven-aged stands, suggests that most unburned chaparral stands eventually develop uneven-aged structure across the range of environments represented in the study area. Even though a small proportion of seeds from obligate-seeders are non-refractory and can produce seedlings in the absence of fire (Keeley 1987), successful inter-fire recruitment of obligate-seeders in Mediterranean type ecosystems is rare because seedlings are generally thought to not establish successfully in intact, robust shrublands (Biswell and Gilman 1961, Christensen and Muller 1975, Enright and Goldblum 1999, Ooi et al. 2006). In contrast, we found that, although fire-free recruits showed evidence of suppressed growth rates (Duren 2009), they persisted to at least 46 yr of age.|$|E
40|$|Grassland {{ecosystems}} cover vast {{areas of}} the Earth's surface and provide many ecosystem services including carbon (C) storage, biodiversity preservation {{and the production of}} livestock forage. Predicting the future delivery of these services is difficult, because widespread changes in atmospheric CO 2 concentration, climate and nitrogen (N) inputs are expected. We compiled published data from global change driver manipulation experiments and combined these with climate data to assess grassland biomass responses to CO 2 and N enrichment across a range of climates. CO 2 and N enrichment generally increased aboveground biomass (AGB) but effects of CO 2 enrichment were weaker than those of N. The response to N was also dependent on the amount of N added and rainfall, with a greater response in high precipitation regions. No relationship between response to CO 2 and climate was detected within our dataset, thus suggesting that <b>other</b> <b>site</b> <b>characteristics,</b> e. g. soils and plant community composition, are more important regulators of grassland responses to CO 2. A statistical model of AGB response to N was used in conjunction with projected N deposition data to estimate changes to future biomass stocks. This highlighted several potential hotspots (e. g. in some regions of China and India) of grassland AGB gain. Possible benefits for C sequestration and forage production in these regions may be offset by declines in plant biodiversity caused by these biomass gains, thus necessitating careful management if ecosystem service delivery is to be maximized. An approach such as ours, in which meta-analysis is combined with global scale model outputs to make large-scale predictions, may complement the results of dynamic global vegetation models, thus allowing us to form better predictions of biosphere responses to environmental change...|$|E

Earlier work analyzing inequalities in Indian cities employed a constructed index of multiple deprivations (IMDs) utilizing data from the Census of India 2001 ([URL] While that index, described in an earlier paper, provided a first approach to identify heterogeneity at the citywide scale, it neither provided information on spatial variations within the geographical boundaries of the Census database, nor about physical characteristics, such as green spaces and the variation in housing density and quality. In this article, we analyze whether different types of sub-standard residential areas can be identified through remote sensing data, combined, where relevant, with ground-truthing and local knowledge. The specific questions address: (1) {{the extent to which}} types of residential sub-standard areas can be drawn from remote sensing data, based on patterns of green space, structure of layout, density of built-up areas, size of buildings and other site characteristics; (2) the spatial diversity of these residential types for selected electoral wards; and (3) the correlation between different types of sub-standard residential areas and the results of the index of multiple deprivations utilized at electoral ward level found previously.

The analysis of heterogeneity showed that wards with higher IMD scores displayed more or less the full range of residential types, implying that visual image interpretation is able to zoom in on clusters of deprivation of varying size. Finally, the visual interpretation of the diversity of residential types matched the results of the IMD analysis quite well, although the limited number of test wards would need to be expanded to strengthen this statement. Visual image analysis strengthens the robustness of the IMD, and in addition, gives a better idea of the degree of heterogeneity in deprivations within a ward...|$|E

These STIs are composed of two antennas on a short baseline (less than 1 km) that observe the same unmodulated beacon signal broadcast from a geostationary satellite (e. g., Anik F 2). The STIs are used to measure the differential phase between the two received signals as well as the individual signal attenuation at each terminal. There are currently three NASA sites utilizing STIs; the Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex near Barstow, California; the White Sands Complex in Las Cruces, New Mexico; and the Guam Remote Ground Terminal on the island of Guam. The first two sites are both located in desert regions that have highly similar climates in terms of their seasonal temperatures, average humidity, and annual rain fall (the primary factors in determining phase stability). In contrast, Guam is in a tropical region with drastically higher annual rainfall and humidity. Five station years of data have been collected in Goldstone, three in White Sands, and two in Guam, yielding two years of simultaneous data collection across all three sites.

Relative abundances for fourteen <b>other</b> species and <b>site</b> <b>characteristics</b> (e. g., elevation, forest cover type, distance to urban edge) for each camera location were determined to develop a generalized linear model for the distribution of each species across the study area. Coyote distribution was most affected by the relative abundances of their prey species and not by landscape characteristics or sympatric carnivore species. Coyotes are the top predator in the area and therefore their distribution is correlated with the relative abundances of their prey species, unlike other parts of their range where they are controlled by larger carnivores. Red and gray foxes both had negative relationships with the relative abundance of coyotes as coyotes have been shown to adversely impact fox distributions and access to resources. Both red and gray foxes were also negatively or uncorrelated with increased levels of urbanization, which is both supported and refuted by published literature and is likely system specific...|$|R
40|$|Adoption of {{ecological}} sites as {{monitoring and management}} units {{by a variety of}} land users has prompted discussion of their benefits for wildlife habitat management. Density and occurrence of shrub-steppe passerines are often related to key habitat characteristics such as plant species composition, cover, and structure. Until recently, ecological sites have not been tested as units for monitoring and management of passerines. We conducted a study implementing ecological sites as management units and used passerines as indicators of potential use of these <b>sites.</b> Ecological <b>site</b> <b>characteristics</b> and three sagebrush-obligate passerines were quantified on ecological sites at and near Browns Park National Wildlife Refuge in Colorado. In 2006 and 2007, we surveyed passerines and <b>site</b> <b>characteristics</b> using standard techniques within 101, 100 -m radius plots. Density of Brewer’s sparrow (Spizella breweri) and occurrence of Brewer’s sparrow, sage sparrow (Amphispiza belli), and sage thrasher (Oreoscoptes montanu) were estimated for six ecological sites and then related to <b>site</b> <b>characteristics.</b> For example, Brewer’s sparrow densities were greatest (3. 0 birds/ha) on a Loamy Fine Sand Ecological Site containing taller vegetation than vegetation for <b>other</b> ecological <b>sites.</b> Scientific literature commonly associates Brewer’s sparrows with sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) presence, but on ecological sites at Browns Park Brewer’s densities are related more to vegetative structure rather than species composition. Results show there are links between passerine populations and ecological sites; a relationship which provides a meaningful foundation in developing long-term monitoring protocols and enhancing management decisions to favor sagebrush-obligate passerines...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 In {{recent years}} the {{conversion}} of agricultural lands to more intensive non-rural land uses has become a focus of increasing public awareness and concern. The growing attention to farmland conversion is manifested in increasing public policies and legilsation to protect agricultural and forestry land uses. Nevertheless, {{our understanding of the}} farmland conversion process is restricted. Although agricultural land conversion has been descriptively addressed, little consideration has been given to defining and analyzing the factors affecting the spatial pattern of rural land conversion. The purpose of this investigation was to analyze the impact of selected variables on agricultural land transition to more intensive non-agricultural uses. The research tested the reliability of a composite <b>site</b> <b>characteristic</b> model, and individual submodels for explaining land conversion patterns in Washington County, Oregon. Within the framework of the <b>site</b> <b>characteristic</b> model, specific objectives were: (1) to determine those site factors which exhibited a significant influence on agricultural land conversion, (2) to estimate empirically the influence of each factor on agricultural land conversion, and (3) to determine differences in the effect of individual factors and composite models on agricultural land conversion in areas with varying stages of urbanization. The <b>site</b> <b>characteristic</b> model examined in the investigation included twenty-three predictor variables drawn from four sets of site factors. These four broad categories of <b>site</b> <b>characteristics</b> are accessibility indices, infrastructural-policy factors, social factors, and environmental factors. Individual regression models were developed for each set of <b>site</b> <b>characteristic</b> variables, as well as, for the composite <b>site</b> <b>characteristic</b> model. Published government documents, planning reports, and manually calculated information from aerial photographs provided the primary sources of these data. Following the collection of farmland conversion data from 1963 and 1973 aerial photography for Washington County, a series of multiple regression analyses were undertaken. The results of these analyses showed that the hypothesized <b>site</b> <b>characteristics</b> proved important factors in explaining farmland conversion patterns. The composite <b>site</b> <b>characteristic</b> model, with fourteen predictor variables, accounted for 78 percent of the variation in farmland conversion for the county. Geographically, the composite model was most effective in explaining land conversion in urban sections of the county (R² =. 676), while achieving its lowest precision in urban-rural fringe areas (R 2 =. 627). As expected, the effectiveness of individual submodels varied extensively with respect to explaining land conversion. Several of the hypothesized variables were consistently strong performers accounting for much of the variation in farmland transition. Conversely, numerous variables proved of only peripheral value during the modeling. The modeling results showed the most powerful set of variables to be the infrastructural-policy factors. This submodel, with four significant variables, was able to explain 70. 7 percent of the variation in farmland transition for the entire county. Conversely, the weakest set of <b>site</b> <b>characteristics</b> were the environmental factors. With five significant variables the environment submodel accounted for 49. 2 percent of the farmland conversion in the study area. As {{in the case of the}} composite model, the relative effectiveness of the submodels varied extensively between urban, urban-rural fringe, and rural portions of Washington County. The research results of the investigation found that the <b>site</b> <b>characteristic</b> model provided a consistently powerful tool for understanding farmland transition in all sections of Washington County, Oregon. The strong measure of reliability associated with the <b>site</b> <b>characteristic</b> methodology, viewed within the framework of concern for farmland conversion, suggests that the conclusions of this investigation may have broad policy implications. The linkage between farmland development and <b>site</b> <b>characteristics</b> provide insight regarding the operation of agricultural land conversion process. Drawing on the relationships pointed out in the investigation, Washington County and other governmental units may find that the study findings can assist in improving mechanisms for controlling land conversion...|$|R
25|$|Male Hemipepsis ustulata often pick palo verde {{trees as}} {{landmark}} territories. The most preferred territories {{tend to be}} located higher up the mountain ridges. During the male flight season, there is considerable turnover in territorial ownership. The average duration of male residence is around 8 days. Ownership is contested through aerial combat. Larger males have the advantage, displacing smaller males from the preferred territories {{over the course of}} the mating season. There is a great abundance of males during mating season; females are rarely seen. The operational sex ratio during this time is highly skewed towards males. In some ways, H. ustulata’s mating system resembles lek polygyny. In hilltopping insects, the male defends territories. Females may visit the territories, but they only remain long enough to mate, not to nest or feed. In a lekking species, the male-defended territory does not contain incentive of resources for females, such as food, shelter, or attractive nesting <b>sites.</b> <b>Other</b> <b>characteristics</b> of Hemipepsis ustulata’s lekking behavior include: (1) the existence of a mating arena, where males aggregate year after year, with each male protecting its own perch/display territory and (2) receptive females mate selectively and upon the inspection of the territorial males.|$|R

40|$|Shrubland {{habitat and}} {{wildlife}} {{species have been}} declining throughout most of New England since the 1950 s. Many songbirds have been declining {{at a rate of}} 4 to 7 percent per year in New England, and these species require large openings to breed. Large shrubland openings are uncommon and today’s birds rely primarily on humans to create and maintain their required habitats. Our study focused on prairie warblers and field sparrows. We determined presence/absence and abundance of these birds in 53 shrubland habitats in Stafford County, New Hampshire, of four types: recent clearcuts, powerline rights-of-way, regenerating old fields and gravel pits. Our methods included the use of mist netting, male bird song playback, banding, and binoculars. We measured vegetation density, height and percent cover to determine if these <b>site</b> <b>characteristics</b> could be used to predict the presence/absence and abundance of these birds. Most of the birds we captured and/or resighted were in gravel pits (64. 3 %) and powerlines (38. 5 %). Gravel pits had significantly more bare ground and lower fern height then the <b>other</b> three <b>site</b> types and were more than twice as large as the <b>other</b> <b>site</b> types on average...|$|R
40|$|To {{statistically}} characterize {{atmospheric effects}} on Ka-band links at NASA operational sites, NASA has constructed site test interferometers (STI s) which directly measure the tropospheric phase stability and rain attenuation. These instruments observe an unmodulated beacon signal broadcast from a geostationary satellite (e. g., Anik F 2) {{and measure the}} phase difference between the signals received by the two antennas and its signal attenuation. Three STI s have been deployed so far: the first one at the NASA Deep Space Network Tracking Complex in Goldstone, California (May 2007); the second at the NASA White Sands Complex, in Las Cruses, New Mexico (February 2009); and the third at the NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS) Remote Ground Terminal (GRGT) complex in Guam (May 2010). Two station-years of simultaneous atmospheric phase fluctuation data have been collected at Goldstone and White Sands, while one year of data has been collected in Guam. With identical instruments operating simultaneously, we can directly compare the phase stability and rain attenuation at the three sites. Phase stability is analyzed statistically {{in terms of the}} root-mean-square (rms) of the tropospheric induced time delay fluctuations over 10 minute blocks. For two years, the time delay fluctuations at the DSN site in Goldstone, CA, have been better than 2. 5 picoseconds (ps) for 90 % of the time (with reference to zenith), meanwhile at the White Sands, New Mexico site, the time delay fluctuations have been better than 2. 2 ps with reference to zenith) for 90 % of time. For Guam, the time delay fluctuations have been better than 12 ps (reference to zenith) at 90 % of the time, the higher fluctuations are as expected from a high humidity tropical rain zone. This type of data analysis, as well as many <b>other</b> <b>site</b> quality <b>characteristics</b> (e. g., rain attenuation, infrastructure, etc.) will be used to determine the suitability of all the sites for NASA s future communication services at Ka-band...|$|R
