5|$|After {{the initial}} {{sequence}} of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed. Deformation typically <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy that <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> {{of other}} issues may be preventable. Seizures are {{controllable}} with medication in about 70% of cases. Inexpensive options are often available. In those whose seizures {{do not respond to}} medication, then surgery, neurostimulation, or dietary changes may be considered. Not all cases of epilepsy are lifelong, and many people improve to the point that treatment is no longer needed.|$|E

5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{does not}} itself have many predators and large {{individuals}} are adept at jumping and swimming to escape attackers. Any attached juveniles benefit from this. However, the scallops are intolerant of low salinity levels, and mortality sometimes <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of {{a pool of}} relatively fresh water that sometimes forms {{during the summer months}} under the sea ice as it melts.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} bond between atoms <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of electromagnetic interactions, {{as described by}} the laws of quantum mechanics. The strongest bonds are formed by the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms, allowing the formation of molecules. Within a molecule, electrons move under the influence of several nuclei, and occupy molecular orbitals; much as they can occupy atomic orbitals in isolated atoms. A fundamental factor in these molecular structures is the existence of electron pairs. These are electrons with opposed spins, allowing them to occupy the same molecular orbital without violating the Pauli exclusion principle (much like in atoms). Different molecular orbitals have different spatial distribution of the electron density. For instance, in bonded pairs (i.e. in the pairs that actually bind atoms together) electrons can be found with the maximal probability in a relatively small volume between the nuclei. By contrast, in non-bonded pairs electrons are distributed in a large volume around nuclei.|$|E

25|$|Rearranging the Laplace and Poiseuille {{relations}} {{suggests that}} radial growth <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of circumferential stretch and circumferential growth <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of shear stress. Shear stress {{is proportional to}} the speed inside the vessel as well as the pressure drop between two fixed points on the vessel wall. The precise mechanism of vessel remodelling is believed to be high stress on the inner wall of the vessel which can induce growth, which heads toward uniform compressive and tensile stress {{on both sides of the}} vessel wall. Generally, it has been found that circumferential residual stress is compressive and tensile, indicating that inner layers of the endothelial tube grow more than outer layers.|$|E

40|$|This thesis has {{identified}} the incentives {{for the growth}} of the commercial strip along State Road 109 in Anderson, Indiana. The thesis through a case study of the historical development of the commercial strip established the following findings. First, the commercial strip <b>occurred</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of increasing urban evolution. Second, the commercial strip <b>occurred</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of land speculation. Third, the commercial strip is <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of the commercial zoning and rezoning patterns. Fourth, the commercial strip <b>occurred</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of increased regional accessibility. Fifth, the commercial strip is <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of increased land values.

Degradation of an object <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of the interaction between the environment or with the materials that form the object however, in the case of ceramics, environmental factors are the major cause.

Males distinguish reproductive {{females of}} their species from females of other species using pheromones. This <b>occurs</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> of sexually stimulating pheromones secreted from the poison glands of reproductive P. barbatus females. These pheromones are perfectly detected by males of the species upon physical contact, resulting in the stimulation of sexual behavior.|$|E

This leads to severe vomiting, colicky diarrhea, intense pain and then paralysis of the skeletal muscles.

Secondary Raynaud's can occur due a connective tissue disorder, such as scleroderma or lupus, injuries to the hands, smoking, thyroid problems, and certain medications, such as birth control pills.
