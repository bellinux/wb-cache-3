50|$|Another safety {{mechanisms}} of boilers is the control safety devices. One control safety device is the low water cut off switch. This device detects {{the amount of}} water in the boiler. A low amount of water flowing to a boiler could potentially cause a boiler to overheat ultimately damaging the boiler. The safety mechanism used to control firing rate of boiler is called the <b>operating</b> <b>switch.</b> This <b>operating</b> <b>switch</b> also has the ability to turn the boiler on and off. This switch is inspected to ensure proper functioning ability. Pressure control devices include the <b>operating</b> <b>switch</b> and the high temperature limit switch. These prevent over pressurizing of the boiler by controlling firing rate and providing an automatic shut off if temperature reaches beyond safe operating conditions. Expansion tanks are used in boilers to allow the expansion and contraction of water to travel somewhere.|$|E

It is shown that switching supply voltage {{positive and negative}} half-cycles to stator windings in special sequence, the rotor of drive is rotating three times slower than switched to three-phase supply voltage. It is possible to make the oscillating regime of drive if the order {{of positive and negative}} half-cycles of the supply voltage are switched to stator windings. This can be achieved by microcontroller program not by changing power and control circuits. Also mechanical and other characteristics of drive are made in rotating and oscillating regimes.

40|$|Pulse-width {{modulation}} (PWM) is {{a widely}} used strategy for <b>operating</b> <b>switch</b> controlled systems. A new model for PWM systems is reported which provides the discrete-time response of the one-cycle-average value of any signal in the system. The new model typically has unstable zero dynamics, {{as well as a}} nonlinear dependence on the duty ratio input. Using scheduled output redefinition, an approximate design model is derived which has stable zero dynamics. A controller based on discrete- time input-output linearization is then developed using this approximate design model. Although this approach leads to approximate rather than perfect output tracking, it guarantees internal stability.

40|$|A basic {{understanding}} of the critical issues limiting the compactness of high-voltage systems {{is required for the}} next generation of impulse generators. In the process of optimizing the design of a highly reliable solid-dielectric over-voltage switch, an understanding of the limiting factors found are shown. Results of a l 3 O kV <b>operating</b> <b>switch,</b> having a modest field enhancement of 16 % above the average field stress in the switching region, are reported. The resulting high reliability is obtained by reducing the standard deviation of the switch to 6. 8 %. The total height of the switch is 1 mm. The resulting operating parameters are obtained by controlling field distribution across the entire switch package and field shaping the desired point of switch closure. The disclosed field management technique provides an approach to improve other highly stressed components and structures...|$|E
40|$|Feeder {{lines are}} one of the most often used types of {{flexible}} transit services connecting a service area to a major transit network through a transfer point. They often switch operations between a demand responsive and a fixed-route policy. In designing and running such systems, the identification of the condition justifying the <b>operating</b> <b>switch</b> is often hard to properly evaluate. In this paper, we propose an analytical model and solution of the problem to assist decision makers and operators in their choice. By employing continuous approximations, we derive handy but powerful closed-form expressions to estimate the critical demand densities, representing the switching point between the competing operating policies. Based on the results of one-vehicle and two-vehicle operations for various scenarios, in comparison to values generated from simulation, we verify the validity of our analytical modeling approach.

40|$|Pulse width {{modulation}} (PWM) is {{a widely}} used strategy for <b>operating</b> <b>switch</b> controlled power electronic circuits and systems. One method of designing digital controllers for PWM systems is based on inversion of nonlinear discrete-time maps which define the input-output relation (for output control) or the input-state relation (for state control). Unfortunately, any direct attempt to implement this type of control would generally require either {{a great deal of}} on-line computation or a very large memory space for data storage. In this paper, piecewise-linear methods are used to simplify the discrete-time map inversion process without incurring any significant degradation in accuracy. The result is that substantially improved control performance is now achievable with a better balance between computation and storage requirements.

Industrial injury rate during the last ten years was reported as 0. 7 %, and has been kept at around 0. 6 % from 2010 to the present. The number of industrial injury in 2010 was 90, 842 among total 98, 645 injuries, and 16, 881 injuries were from caught-in or between injuries. In 2008, the injuries from being caught-in or between by press machine was 1, 655, which was identified as the main of caught-in or between injuries. It needs various methods to prevent injuries by the press machine. To reduce the accidents from press machine analysis of related accidents during the last three years and surveys for workers’ safety consciousness were conducted. And, it sought a method to apply the protective principle of the safety devices to the mold. From the accident analysis, it was shown that many accidents occurred when small materials were handled by hands near the mold of the full revolution clutch type press, and hand operating types caused more accidents than foot operating types. From surveys, workers were found to operate pressing job ignoring safety from habit or/and for high productivity, though they are aware of the danger. As a means of injury prevention by the safety device's protective principle, it suggested sequential refusal type as an alternative to overcome seclusion type of risk zone. And, to secure fundamental safety, it suggested a way not for part of body to slide into the risk zone from the existing method in which material feeding was originally made by hands. In addition, it suggested of using Presence Sensing Device Initiation (PSDI) safety device instead of foot <b>operating</b> <b>switch.</b> Finally, it suggested more intensive inspection, education and management by safety supervision authorities...|$|E
