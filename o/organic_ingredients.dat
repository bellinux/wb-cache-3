The site features information on Tom Brady’s training regimen and includes a store to purchase TB12 equipment and merchandise. Later in the year, on August 23, 2016, the TB12 brand then expanded to offer a snack line. The snacks contain raw, vegan, and <b>organic</b> <b>ingredients</b> that are also free of gluten and dairy. The following month, Brady, alongside Boston Private and Robert Paul Properties, {{announced the}} formation of the TB12 Foundation. The purpose of the nonprofit foundation is to provide free post-injury rehabilitation care and training to underprivileged, young athletes. In March 2017, Brady moved beyond his snack line and partnered with meal-kit startup Purple Carrot to offer his own line of TB12 Performance Meals. The meals utilize whole foods and focus on providing nutrients for workout recovery. On September 19, 2017, Simon & Schuster published Brady's first book, The TB12 Method: How to Achieve a Lifetime of Sustained Peak Performance. Within 48 hours, it had become a number one best-seller on Amazon.com. The book also reached #1 on the New York Times' weekly Best Sellers list, to be featured in the October 8, 2017 edition.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the large}} number of unusual dishes, Schwa is perhaps best known for Carlson's simple, modern {{interpretation}} of Italian classics. Among the most popular dishes is the quail egg ravioli, which has been on the menu since day one. [...] Considered the restaurant's signature dish, it consists of a single ravioli stuffed with quail egg yolk and laced with truffle butter. [...] Schwa is known for emphasizing locally grown produce, and many dishes feature <b>organic</b> <b>ingredients.</b> [...] However, The Local Beet (a website that promotes eating locally grown food) questioned Schwa's commitment to the principle, noting the use of out-of-season strawberries and peas. Most dishes are served with purées.|$|E

[...] Within weeks, the restaurant had garnered a strong buzz among local foodies. [...] National press attention quickly followed, including Carlson receiving [...] "Best New Chef" [...] honors from Food & Wine magazine, as Schwa {{earned a reputation}} for great food and an innovative chef-customer relationship.

Testicular histology revealed that feeding organic turmeric {{in the diet}} before exposure conferred some protection on the testicular tissue while the feeding of organic turmeric in the diet after exposure corrected some of the damage inflicted by exposure to UV radiation. The group (T 4) that did not receive organic turmeric showed conspicuous damage in the testicular tissue on exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
