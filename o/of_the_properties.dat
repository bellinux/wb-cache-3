5|$|In 1033, Guterre Pelayo, {{a leading}} {{captain of the}} Reconquista for the County of Portugal, was {{recognized}} by Bermudo, Emperor in Gallaecia, as the Lord of Varzim, during the cahotic epoch following Almanzor's attack on the Christian realms. Henry, the Portuguese count, recognized his rule over the port of Varzim amongst several other possessions. Varzim overlords gained significant power and, when Portugal was already a stable kingdom, Sancho I of Portugal attacked the fief and seized the port, destroyed most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> and expelled the farmers. The northern area became known as Varzim dos Cavaleiros (Knights' Varzim) and belonged to the military order of the Knights Hospitaller, who inherited {{the wealth of the}} local overlords. Lower Varzim, the royal southern land, was the location of the port and contiguous farmlands.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Soviet {{scientist}} Victor Cherdyntsev, who {{had previously}} claimed the existence of primordial curium-247, claimed to have discovered element 108 (specifically, the 267Hs isotope, which supposedly had a half-life of 400 to 500million years) in natural molybdenite and suggested the name sergenium (symbol Sg; at the time, this symbol {{had not yet been}} taken by seaborgium) for it, after the ancient city of Serik along the Silk Road in Kazakhstan where his molybdenite samples came from. His rationale for claiming that sergenium was the heavier homologue to osmium was that minerals supposedly containing sergenium formed volatile oxides when boiled in nitric acid, similarly to osmium. His findings were criticized by V. M. Kulakov on the grounds that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> Cherdyntsev claimed sergenium had were inconsistent with the then-current nuclear physics.|$|E

5|$|In 1980, the Housing Act 1980 gave council tenants {{the right}} to buy their homes. In light of this, a group of 1500 {{properties}} in the area was given Conservation Area status, and Plumbe's northern section of the estate was granted Article Four Direction by Michael Heseltine, Secretary of State for the Environment, preventing any alterations to the external appearances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> without planning permission, in recognition of its architectural and historic interest. St Mark's Church was meanwhile Grade II listed. However, these measures have not been consistently enforced, and Noel Park has been cited in a report by English Heritage as a prominent example of the failure of conservation areas.|$|E
5|$|In December 2015, the Joint Working Party of {{international}} scientific bodies International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) recognized the element's discovery and assigned {{the priority of}} the discovery to the Dubna–Livermore collaboration. This was on account of two 2009 and 2010 confirmations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> of the granddaughter of 294Og, 286Fl, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, {{as well as the}} observation of another consistent decay chain of 294Og by the Dubna group in 2012. The goal of that experiment had been the synthesis of 294Ts via the reaction 249Bk(48Ca,3n), but the short half-life of 249Bk resulted in a significant quantity of the target having decayed to 249Cf, resulting in the synthesis of oganesson instead of tennessine.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of antisymmetry, {{solutions}} of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This {{is responsible for the}} Pauli exclusion principle, which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in an atom, rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.|$|E

Development in the 20th century saw new houses built, but mainline water and electricity arrived later than {{in other parts of}} Britain, perhaps due to the small population. Excavations of a cropmark enclosure at Edderside, beyond the Moss to the southeast of Salta, were conducted in 1989–1990 by Robert H. Bewley.|$|E
5|$|Several {{authors have}} {{commented on the}} {{metallic}} nature of some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> of astatine. Since iodine is a semiconductor {{in the direction of}} its planes, and since the halogens become more metallic with increasing atomic number, it has been presumed that astatine would be a metal if it could form a condensed phase. Astatine may be metallic in the liquid state on the basis that elements with an enthalpy of vaporization (∆Hvap) greater than ~42 kJ/mol are metallic when liquid. Such elements include boron, silicon, germanium, antimony, selenium and tellurium. Estimated values for ∆Hvap of diatomic astatine are 50 kJ/mol or higher; diatomic iodine, with a ∆Hvap of 41.71, falls just short of the threshold figure.|$|E

5|$|Soviet chemist D. K. Dobroserdov was {{the first}} {{scientist}} to claim to have found eka-caesium, or francium. In 1925, he observed weak radioactivity {{in a sample of}} potassium, another alkali metal, and incorrectly concluded that eka-caesium was contaminating the sample (the radioactivity from the sample was from the naturally occurring potassium radioisotope, potassium-40). He then published a thesis on his predictions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>properties</b> of eka-caesium, in which he named the element russium after his home country.
