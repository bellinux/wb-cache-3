5|$|Minnesota drove 71 {{yards on}} its first possession, scored the game's first points on a 27-yard field goal by Adam Bailey and led 3–0 after one quarter. After the opening drive, Michigan's defense shut down the Golden Gophers, {{allowing}} only 33 yards of total <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the game. Minnesota was held to 10 yards of total <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entire second half, as Michigan extended its fourth-quarter shutout to 8 games. Michigan also held its opponent without a touchdown {{for the fifth time}} in 8 games and shut down Minnesota so effectively that Michigan started four drives in Minnesota territory in the first half.|$|E
5|$|Facing the Hokies {{were the}} Falcons of the United States Air Force Academy, {{who had gone}} 74 during the regular season, {{including}} a 53 record in the Western Athletic Conference.

Results showed differences <b>in</b> <b>offense</b> patterns, <b>the</b> prevalence of risk factors, {{and the impact of}} these risk factors on recidivism between the ethnic groups. Public-order offenses were most common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Dutch group, nonviolent property <b>offenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Moroccan and Turkish groups, violent property <b>offenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Surinamese group, and both public-order and nonviolent property <b>offenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Antillean group. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> case of ethnic majority youth, risk factors in most domains (family, school, friends, use of free time, and mental health) were associated with recidivism, whereas {{only a small number of}} risk factors were associated with recidivism among ethnic minority youth. Interventions aimed at these risk factors may therefore be less effective in reducing recidivism in ethnic minority youth...|$|R

5|$|Coming {{into the}} game, Arizona and Nevada {{were two of}} <b>the</b> top <b>offenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, ranking 7th and 10th in yards per game respectively. There was also {{significant}} hype surrounding the game because it featured {{two of the best}} running backs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country, Ka'Deem Carey for Arizona, and Stefphon Jefferson for Nevada. Carey was ranked number one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country <b>in</b> total rushing yards, while Jefferson was ranked number two. The duo were also prolific scorers; Jefferson was second <b>in</b> <b>the</b> country <b>in</b> rushing touchdowns with 25 and Carey was third with 24. The game was widely expected to be a shoot-out, as both teams were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> top-20 scoring <b>offenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> regular season.|$|R
40|$|Background: Following {{the model}} of the drug {{treatment}} courts in USA, this institute is applied in some European countries as well, which is the direction the Czech justice could proceed. Due to <b>the</b> similarities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system of care for drug users and demographic situations, this paper compares the approaches to prosecuted ones for drug law <b>offenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic to Belgium, where drug treatment courts already exist. Aims: The aim of this work is to compare approaches to the prosecuted ones for drug law <b>offenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic and Belgium, and to propose appropriate solutions or research in this area for the Czech Republic. Methods: The method of analysis is used while studying literature and documents. A method of comparison compares the drug scene, system of an addictological care and drug- related crimes in both countries. Furthermore compares approaches to the prosecuted ones for drug <b>offenses</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Czech Republic and Belgium, especially alternatives and their use in practice. Results: In Belgium, there are significantly more used alternatives <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earlier stages of the criminal proceedings than the courts. The biggest difference, however, is the existence of the project Proefzorg (the level of a criminal prosecution) and drug treatment court (court proceeding) in Belgium, [...] ...|$|R

5|$|After {{enduring}} {{seven months}} of rehabilitation for his injury, Killebrew remained in pain but rebounded to have his best season in 1969. On July 5, Killebrew set a career-high with six RBIs {{in a game against}} the Oakland Athletics. That personal best lasted barely two months: on September 7 he hit a three-run home run and a grand slam for seven RBIs, all in the first two innings, to defeat the Athletics again. Killebrew led the best <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league and rookie manager Billy Martin's Twins won the new American League West division as a result.|$|E

In the 15th College All-Star vs. NFL Champion match, the Cardinals scored the biggest victory to date with a 28–0 victory. Among the collegians were Lujack and Chuck Conerly. The professional athletes included Paul Christman and Charley Trippi. Supposedly, the 1947 class had a void at fullback, {{which may have been}} the problem with their <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> All-Star game shutout.|$|E
5|$|Chicago Bears quarterback Jim McMahon, on {{the active}} roster {{for the first}} time in the season, came off the bench in the third quarter to rally the Bears past the Buccaneers. He scored a {{touchdown}} on a quarterback sneak with six minutes to go, and tied the game with a touchdown pass to Neal Anderson with 1:28 to go. The Buccaneers allowed seven sacks, but led for most of the game. The Bears were aided by the Buccaneers' poor clock management and their reliance on a conservative <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth quarter. Perkins denied accusations that they went to a prevent defense and a three-man rush, but admitted that they played too conservatively on defense at the end. Steve DeBerg threw touchdown passes to Calvin Magee and Jeff Smith on the Buccaneers' first two possessions. On the Bears' next possession, Ron Holmes' hit on Mike Tomczak forced a fumble that was recovered in the end zone by Winston Moss to give the Buccaneers a 20–0 lead. The Bears scored two quick touchdowns in the second quarter, but the Buccaneers extended their lead with two Donald Igwebuike field goals. With the Bears struggling on offense, McMahon was inserted into the game. McMahon was 12 of 14 for 144yards and led the Bears to 156yards of <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> last two drives, compared with 142 in the first 50minutes of the game. A win would have tied the Buccaneers with the Bears for first place in the NFC Central.|$|E

5|$|The 2002 Gator Bowl {{kicked off}} on January 1, 2002 at Alltel Stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, exactly one {{year since the}} Hokies had last played in the game.

In the first quarter, Tech held Florida State scoreless despite only managing a single field goal on <b>offense.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> second quarter, however, Florida State began to find gaps in the Hokie defense and scored 10points. At halftime, Florida State held a 103 lead.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} marred by the revelation that a Texas player had been {{competing}} under an assumed name. Other off-the-field incidents also took place prior to the game.

Texas took an early lead in the competition and led 107 at halftime, but Virginia Tech's defense shut out Texas' <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half and Tech scored 21 unanswered points. In recognition of his achievements in the game, Virginia Tech wide receiver Bryan Still was named the game's most valuable player.|$|E

5|$|Defensively, {{both teams}} found success at times. In the first half, Texas' defense held the Hokies {{to just one}} touchdown, {{and that was not}} {{recorded}} until the second quarter. Virginia Tech's offense was extremely successful in shutting down the Longhorns' <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second half of the game. The Hokies shut out the Longhorns in that half, setting a bowl-game record for fewest points allowed in a half. Texas' 10 points, 78 yards rushing and 226 yards total offense were all season lows. In total, Tech's defense had nine tackles for loss, including five sacks of Brown. Linebacker Brandon Semones was Tech's leading tackler, and he had nine tackles, a sack, and a pass breakup. In pass defense, Torrian Gray had two interceptions, and William Yarborough had one. Gray's interceptions tied a Virginia Tech bowl-game record. Defensive tackle Jim Barron's fumble return for a touchdown was the first such score in the Sugar Bowl since a rule change in 1990.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Johnson missed most of {{the season}} with a knee injury, and New York dropped to 4–10, {{resulting}} in Tarkenton being traded back to the Vikings. The Giants rallied somewhat in 1972 to finish 8–6. Journeyman quarterback Norm Snead (acquired in the trade for Tarkenton) led the league in completion percentage and had his best season. Other standouts and Pro Bowl selections that year were running back Johnson, who rushed for 1,182 yards (breaking his own team record) and caught 45 passes, tight end Bob Tucker, who followed up his 1971 NFC-leading 59-catch season with 55 in 1972, and defensive stars Jack Gregory and John Mendenhall. The Giants boasted the top <b>offense</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFC and after a season-finishing 23–3 win at Dallas to secure their second winning campaign in three years, the future looked bright. However, after the 1972 season, New York would endure one of the worst periods in its history.|$|E

He played one drive in the fourth preseason game, throwing an incomplete pass against the Dallas Cowboys, before suffering a hamstring strain. The Vikings waived/injured him on September 1, and he was placed on season-ending injured reserve on September 2 after he cleared waivers.
