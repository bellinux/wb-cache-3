These attempts led to discomfort within the membership base of the CDU and hampered both parties' chances in the upcoming elections. Kohl himself remained silent during these tensions, which some interpreted as a lack of leadership, while others such as future president Karl Carstens praised him for seeking a consensus at the centre of the party.|$|E

25|$|Although {{reintroduction}} of {{the death}} penalty in Canada is extremely unlikely, support for capital punishment is similar to its support in the United States, where it is carried out regularly in some states and is on the books in most states and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>level.</b> While opposition to the death penalty increased in the 1990s and early 2000s, in recent years Canadians have merged closer to America's position; in 2004 only 48 percent of Canadians favored death for murderers compared to 62 percent in 2010. According to one poll, support for the death penalty in Canada is approximately the same as its support in the United States, at 63 percent in both countries as of 2013. A 2011 poll by the Toronto Sun found that 66 percent of Canadians favored capital punishment, but only 41 percent would actually support its re-introduction in Canada.|$|E

The age of consent was equalised in 2002 by Western Australia and in 2003 by New South Wales and the Northern Territory. The last state to equalise its age of consent was Queensland in 2016, when it brought the age of consent for anal intercourse into line with vaginal intercourse and oral sex from 18 to 16 years of age. By having different ages of consent for heterosexual and homosexual acts the law created disparity between various groups of society. This distinction stated that one act was more serious (or otherwise contentious) than the other. It {{has been said that}} the use of 'non-consent' is merely a label for behaviour that is viewed or deemed immoral.|$|E

The grading and leveling of the road surface was done by hand; no survey instruments were used to level the roadway. The road was opened for public use that October 14, at a preliminary cost of $30,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ). That same year, the Skytop Inn opened on top of the mountain. During 1934, additional work was done to the roadway to build the stone walls. Motorists were restricted to one-way traffic, and the road was only open to the public on Sundays and holidays. In the interim, the road was temporarily used as a connection between completed segments of the parallel state highway, numbered M-129 at the time. This highway, now part of M-26, was built starting in July 1933 but was not completed through the area until October 1934.
