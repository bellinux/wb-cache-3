This would create a class of anglicised Indians who would serve as cultural intermediaries between the British and the Indians; the creation of such a class was necessary before any reform of vernacular education:I feel... {{that it is impossible}} for us, with our limited means, to attempt to educate the body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people.</b> <b>We</b> must at present do our best to form a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom we govern, – a class of persons Indian in blood and colour, but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect. To that class we may leave it to refine the vernacular dialects of the country, to enrich those dialects with terms of science borrowed from the Western nomenclature, and to render them by degrees fit vehicles for conveying knowledge to the great mass of the population.|$|E
25|$|The {{more closely}} we look into history, the more clearly shall we {{perceive}} {{that the system}} of chivalry is an invention almost entirely poetical. It is impossible to distinguish the countries {{in which it is}} said to have prevailed. It is always represented as distant from us both in time and place, and whilst the contemporary historians give us a clear, detailed, and complete account of the vices of the court and the great, of the ferocity or corruption of the nobles, and of the servility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>people,</b> <b>we</b> are astonished to find the poets, after a long lapse of time, adorning the very same ages with the most splendid fictions of grace, virtue, and loyalty. The Romance writers of the twelfth century placed the age of chivalry in the time of Charlemagne. The period when these writers existed, is the time pointed out by Francis I. At the present day , we imagine we can still see chivalry flourishing in the persons of Du Guesclin and Bayard, under Charles V and Francis I. But when we come to examine either the one period or the other, although we find in each some heroic spirits, we are forced to confess {{that it is necessary to}} antedate the age of chivalry, at least three or four centuries before any period of authentic history.|$|E
