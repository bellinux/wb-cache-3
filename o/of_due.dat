5|$|Finally, Kirby also {{suggested}} that there was much scope for expanding {{the reach of the}} limitations on legislative and executive power imposed by Chapter III, and drawing on another paper by McHugh, argued that this ought to extend to the protection <b>of</b> <b>due</b> process rights as implicit constitutional rights, {{in the absence of an}} explicit bill of rights.|$|E
5|$|Although the Dirty War {{ended in}} the eighties, Kirchner {{considered}} it an unresolved issue. In his inaugural speech, he supported human rights organizations which sought the incarceration of the military connected with the National Reorganization Process. He also ordered the top military leadership to retire. Kirchner sent a bill to the Congress to annul the full stop law and the Law <b>of</b> <b>Due</b> Obedience, which had halted trials of the military for crimes related to the Dirty War. The laws had been repealed in 1998, but that repeal had little legal significance, as only an annulment would reopen the cases. Although this initiative was opposed by Duhalde and Scioli, most legislators considered it a symbolic gesture since the laws' constitutionality would {{be decided by the}} Supreme Court. Both laws were annulled by the Congress in August 2003, and many cases were reopened as a result. The Supreme Court declared the laws, and Menem's presidential pardons, unconstitutional in 2005. Jorge Julio López, witness in a trial of police officer Miguel Etchecolatz, disappeared in 2006. This caused a national scandal, as it was suspected that he was disappeared to intimidate other witnesses in the upcoming trials, and the government was unable to locate him.|$|E
5|$|Although {{thunderstorm}} {{activity was}} initially minimal around {{the center of}} circulation, convective band associated with the depression was becoming more organized. Late on September10, convection began to increase slightly near the center, though because Dvorak intensity T-numbers were between 2.0 and 2.5, the depression was not upgraded to a tropical storm. However, dry air briefly caused showers and thunderstorms to decrease later that day. Initially, it headed just north <b>of</b> <b>due</b> west around the southern periphery of a large subtropical ridge. However, by September11, the depression re-curved northwestward. Later that day, the depression began to regain deep convection. Geostationary satellite imagery and scatterometer data indicated that the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Nadine at 0000UTC on September12.|$|E

5|$|Black's view on {{due process}} drew from his reading of British history; to him, due process meant all persons {{were to be}} tried in {{accordance}} with the Bill of Rights' procedural guarantees and in accordance with constitutionally pursuant laws. Black advocated equal treatment by the government for all persons, regardless of wealth, age, or race. Black's view <b>of</b> <b>due</b> process was restrictive {{in the sense that it}} was premised on equal procedures; it did not extend to substantive due process. This was in accordance with Black's literalist views. Black did not tie procedural due process exclusively to the Bill of Rights, but he did tie it exclusively to the Bill of Rights combined with other explicit provisions of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|During the 1990s, {{attempts}} to both ban and legalize same-sex marriage {{did not pass}} through the legislature. After a Maryland House of Delegates committee voted in March 2004 to reject a pair of marriage bills that would have submitted a constitutional amendment against same-sex marriage to voters and invalidated same-sex marriages performed in another state or foreign country, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and Equality Maryland filed a lawsuit, Deane & Polyak v. Conaway, to challenge the existing law on behalf of nine same-sex couples and one bereaved man whose partner had died. The lead plaintiffs, from whom the case received its name, were Gita Deane, a learning specialist at Goucher College, and her partner Lisa Polyak, an environmental engineer for the U.S. Army Medical Department. The plaintiffs had applied for marriage licenses in several different Maryland counties but were denied by court officials. In their complaint, the plaintiffs argued that the state's statutory ban on same-sex marriage violated constitutional protections <b>of</b> <b>due</b> process, equality, and prohibitions against sex discrimination in Articles 24 and 46 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.|$|E
5|$|For {{about six}} days, Ginger {{maintained}} minimal hurricane status. As it meandered over the central Atlantic Ocean, it maintained {{an unusually large}} eye, reaching 80 mi (130 km) in diameter. On September 18, Ginger turned {{to the south and}} slowly executed a tight counterclockwise loop within three days. By September 21, the hurricane was tracking south <b>of</b> <b>due</b> west, and the next day suddenly intensified to winds of 90 mph (150 km/h). Its westward track briefly posed a threat to Bermuda, although Ginger passed 115 mi (185 km) south of the island on September 23 while slowly weakening. On September 24, Ginger decelerated before beginning a turn to the southwest. By September 26, Ginger briefly weakened to minimal hurricane strength, although re-intensification resumed as the track turned to the west and northwest. Around that time, Ginger absorbed the smaller and weaker Tropical Storm Janice to its southeast.|$|E

40|$|Executing {{its policy}} {{in the domain of}} {{finances}} the State can employ <b>dues</b> <b>of</b> various kinds. A substantial number <b>of</b> the <b>dues</b> calls for their classification. The said classification can be performed with the use of different criteria. Yet, the most common one is the subjective vs. objective criterion. The first systemizes dues in the respect of active and passive subjects <b>of</b> the <b>dues.,</b> while the second, in the respect of multiobjective activity of public organs. The said classification is mot the closed one, as in any of the mentioned groups <b>of</b> <b>dues</b> the further divergency is observed: A variety and number <b>of</b> <b>dues</b> call for the selection of those, for the need of the study, which are mostly employed by the State in order to affect the behavior of subjects burdened with them. Excercising the State's influence by means <b>of</b> <b>dues</b> can be <b>of</b> a various range and character. They can react in a positive, stimulating way, on: negatively, halting certain situations or acts of the subjects concerned. They can have their impact by way of prevention, i. e. influencing the future acts, or by way of repression. The State can control the activity or behavior of the concerned subjects employing a proper structure of does. The State's reaction consists in. stalling an object <b>of</b> <b>dues,,</b> reductions, exemptions and first and foremest the rates. Operating with the rates can substantially affect the range and effectiveness of realizing the interventional function. There are dues in the Polish budgetary system which are the example of a correct differentiation of their rates from the viewpoint of the dues' interventional function, but there are also ones which reveal an insufficient differentiation of the rates in order to realize that function properly.

5|$|Hemi {{argued that}} a line of Illinois appellate {{opinions}} demonstrated that Illinois law required more than federal law with regard to satisfying due process standards for personal jurisdiction. The Seventh Circuit rejected this argument, finding {{that none of the}} cases cited by Hemi even suggested a meaningful difference between the federal and Illinois due process standards, and {{that at least one of}} the cases cited by Hemi only discussed the distinction in the theoretical context. Though the Seventh Circuit noted that the district court may only exercise jurisdiction only if both federal and state constitutional elements are satisfied, it also stated that it was unaware of cases where personal jurisdiction could be satisfied under the U.S. Constitution, but not under the Illinois Constitution. Hence, the Seventh Circuit limited its analysis as to whether exercising personal jurisdiction over Hemi would comport with the federal guarantee <b>of</b> <b>due</b> process.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s Credit Suisse began {{catering}} to consumers and the middle-class with deposit counters, currency exchanges and savings accounts. The first branch outside of Zürich was opened in 1905 in Basel. The bank helped companies affected by World War I restructuring, and extended loans for reconstruction efforts. During the 1920s depression, net profits and dividends were halved and employees took salary cuts. After World War II, {{a substantial portion}} of Credit Suisse's business was in foreign reconstruction efforts. Holocaust survivors had problems trying to retrieve assets from relatives that died in concentration camps without death certificates. This led to a class action lawsuit in 1996 that settled in 2000 for $1.25 billion. The Agreement on the Swiss Banks' Code of Conduct with Regard to the Exercise <b>of</b> <b>Due</b> Diligence was created in the 1970s, after a Credit Suisse branch in Chiasso was exposed for illegally funneling $900 million in Italian deposits to speculative investments.|$|E
5|$|Late on November6, Ida re-emerged over water, {{entering}} the northwestern Caribbean Sea. Upon moving back over water, the storm quickly began to redevelop, with convection increasing around {{the center of}} circulation. Early on November7, Ida restrengthened into a tropical storm as it tracked just west <b>of</b> <b>due</b> north. Very warm sea surface temperatures ahead of the system would have allowed for substantial intensification; however, wind shear over the area quickly increased, resulting in modest strengthening. Later that day, the storm turned northwestward {{in response to a}} strong trough over Mexico and a mid-level ridge extending from the Southeast United States to Hispaniola. As Ida neared the Yucatán Channel, an eye redeveloped and the storm quickly intensified into a hurricane. By the morning of November8, the storm had attained Category2 status with winds of 100mph (155km/h).|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's set {{of civil}} laws, the Code Civil—now often {{known as the}} Napoleonic Code—was {{prepared}} by committees of legal experts {{under the supervision of}} Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, the Second Consul. Napoleon participated actively in the sessions of the Council of State that revised the drafts. The development of the code was a fundamental change {{in the nature of the}} civil law legal system with its stress on clearly written and accessible law. Other codes ("Les cinq codes") were commissioned by Napoleon to codify criminal and commerce law; a Code of Criminal Instruction was published, which enacted rules <b>of</b> <b>due</b> process.|$|E
5|$|One {{check on}} a magistrate's power was his collegiality. Each magisterial office {{would be held}} {{concurrently}} by at least two people. Another such check was provocatio. Provocatio was a primordial form <b>of</b> <b>due</b> process. It was a precursor to habeas corpus. If any magistrate tried to use {{the powers of the}} state against a citizen, that citizen could appeal the decision of the magistrate to a tribune. In addition, once a magistrate's one-year term of office expired, he would have to wait ten years before serving in that office again. This created problems for some consuls and praetors, and these magistrates would occasionally have their imperium extended. In effect, they would retain the powers of the office (as a promagistrate), without officially holding that office.|$|E
5|$|Operation Varsity was {{the last}} time that the Hamilcar would be used in combat, but the model did remain in service {{for a number of years}} after the end of the Second World War; they were {{particularly}} useful for transporting large and heavy loads. On 31 December 1945 64 Hamilcars were recorded as being present at RAF Tarrant Rushton, where they were used for routine training exercises. However, in January 1946 a process was begun to dispose of 'surplus' Hamilcars, with 44 moved to disposal facilities and twenty remaining. The remainder continued to be used for routine flying exercises until July, when six more were disposed <b>of</b> <b>due</b> to 'glue deterioration', and by February 1947 only twelve were left in operation. These last few Hamilcars appear to have remained in service until 1950, with several used in airshows and public displays by the RAF, and were ultimately phased out as obsolescent by the mid-1950s.|$|E

The {{most famous and}} enduring of these relationships involved Luísa Margarida Portugal de Barros, Countess of Barral, with whom he formed a romantic and intimate, though not adulterous, friendship after she was appointed governess to the emperor's daughters in November 1856. Throughout his life, the Emperor held onto a hope of finding a soulmate, something he felt cheated <b>of</b> <b>due</b> to {{the necessity of a}} marriage of state to a woman for whom he never felt passion.

5|$|The China Meteorological Administration {{released}} {{a press release}} after the storm and gave four reasons for the extensive damage. First, the storm decelerated after landfall and maintained its identity for 120hours while moving south <b>of</b> <b>due</b> west. Secondly, the storm was asymmetric and rainfall concentrated in the southern semicircle. Also, the storm interacted with the active monsoon over the South China Sea, and the Hong Kong Observatory reported a 1-hour rainfall total of 115.1mm (4.5inches), a new record. Finally, previous rainfall had made the area wetter than normal and more prone to flooding.|$|E
5|$|The cyclone turned northward and {{accelerated}} on August 8 while reaching major hurricane status that evening. Early on August 9, Belle achieved its peak intensity with maximum estimated surface winds of 120 mph (195 km/h) and a minimum pressure of 957 mb (hPa; 28.26 inHg). At higher altitudes within the storm, recon reported winds up to 150 mph (240 km/h). Turning to just east <b>of</b> <b>due</b> north, Belle began weakening shortly thereafter with its eye becoming obscured. Late on August 9, the hurricane passed within 60 mi (95 km) of Hatteras Island, North Carolina. Contrary to most storms which threaten the northeastern states, Belle did not accelerate tremendously as it neared land. Accordingly, it weakened quickly {{in response to}} cooler waters in the region. Around 05:00 UTC on August 10, Belle made landfall as a minimal hurricane with 75 mph (120 km/h) winds along Jones Beach, Long Island, New York. Briefly crossing the Long Island Sound, Belle made a second landfall as a strong tropical storm near Bridgeport, Connecticut. Once inland over New England, the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone while traversing New Hampshire. The remnants accelerated northeast and later due east across Atlantic Canada before emerging over the Labrador Sea on August 12. While situated between the Azores and Greenland, ex-Belle turned north-northeast and ultimately dissipated south of Iceland on August 15.|$|E

5|$|The {{most egregious}} episode during the Red Summer was a vicious attack on blacks in Elaine, Arkansas, in which nearly 200 blacks were murdered. Reports {{coming out of}} the South blamed the blacks, alleging that they were conspiring to take over the government. Infuriated with the distortions, Du Bois {{published}} a letter in the New York World, claiming that the only crime the black sharecroppers had committed was daring to challenge their white landlords by hiring an attorney to investigate contractual irregularities.The sharecroppers were working with the Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America. Over 60 of the surviving blacks were arrested and tried for conspiracy, in the case known as Moore v. Dempsey. Du Bois rallied blacks across America to raise funds for the legal defense, which, six years later, resulted in a Supreme Court victory authored by Oliver Wendell Holmes.

Several hours after being classified, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Fred; this was the first use of the name Fred in the Atlantic basin after it replaced Fabian which was retired in 2003. This followed the development of convective banding features along the periphery of the storm and strong shower and thunderstorm activity forming over the center of Fred. The system continued to organize, with the banding features becoming well-defined within hours and strong outflow developing around the storm.|$|E
