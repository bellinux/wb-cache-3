40|$|A {{cost-effectiveness}} analysis {{is used to}} compare two alternative strategies for the control of tuberculosis in facilities providing long-term care to the elderly: (1) systematic screening of all new residents with the Mantoux test to identify persons infected with the tubercule bacillus, and preventive treatment {{of those who are}} most at risk of tuberculosis as recommended by the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services and (2) clinical follow-up of the index-case contacts as recommended by the Quebec Ministry of Health and Social Services. Incremental effectiveness and cost associated with the American strategy are estimated with a Markov model applied to the Quebec long-term care facilities population. Costs are estimated in the perspective of the health care system. Even though complications due to isoniazid chemoprophylaxis cluster in the year following admission, the American approach is advantageous. At the end of the implementation phase throughout the province of Quebec, this approach prevents 32 cases of tuberculosis annually. The incremental cost is 121 626 $ per year for the entire province, 3 822 $ per case avoided, 9 555 $ per death avoided, 3 437 $ per life-year saved and 2 756 $ per quality-adjusted life-years saved.

40|$|Abstract. Deployment of oral cholera vaccine (OCV) on the Island of Hispaniola {{has been}} {{considered}} since {{the emergence of the}} disease in October of 2010. At that time, emergency response focused on the time-tested measures of treatment to prevent deaths and sanitation to diminish transmission. Use of the limited amount of vaccine available in the global market was recommended for demonstration activities, which were carried out in 2012. As transmission continues, vaccination was recommended in Haiti as one component of a comprehensive initiative supported by an international coalition to eliminate cholera on the Island of Hispaniola. Leveraging its delivery to strengthen <b>other</b> cholera <b>prevention</b> <b>measures</b> and immunization services, a phased OCV introduction is pursued in accordance with global vaccine supply. Not mutually exclusive or sequential deployment options include routine immunization for children over the age of 1 year and campaigns in vulnerable metropolitan areas or rural areas with limited access to health services. BACKGROUND Cholera emerged on the Island of Hispaniola in October of 2010. During the first peak of the outbreak, which lasted from October of 2010 to March of 2011, 526, 351 and 22, 344 suspect and confirmed cases were reported in Haiti and the Domini-can Republic, respectively. 1 Cholera transmission has con-tinued thereafter, although at much decreased rates. Cholera surveillance data for the first 2 years of the Haitian outbreak have been reviewed. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{inflation}} {{pressure of the}} endotracheal tube cuff can cause ischemia of the tracheal mucosa at high pressures; thus, it can cause important tracheal morbidity and tracheal microaspiration of the oropharyngeal secretion, or it can even cause pneumonia associated with mechanical ventilation if {{the pressure of the}} cuff is insufficient. Objective: In order to investigate the effectiveness of the RUSCH&# 174; 7. 5 mm endotracheal tube cuff, {{this study was designed to}} investigate the physical and mechanical aspects of the cuff in contact with the trachea. Methods: For this end, we developed an in vitro experimental model to assess the flow of dye (methylene blue) by the inflated cuff on the wall of the artificial material. We also designed an in vivo study with 12 Large White pigs under endotracheal intubation. We instilled the same dye in the oral cavity of the animals, and we analyzed the presence or not of leakage in the trachea after the region of the cuff after their deaths (animal sacrifice). All cuffs were inflated at the pressure of 30 cmH 2 O. Results: We observed the passage of fluids through the cuff in all in vitro and in vivo experimental models. Conclusion: We conclude that, as well as several other cuff models in the literature, the RUSCH&# 174; 7. 5 mm tube cuffs are also not able to completely seal the trachea and thus prevent aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions. <b>Other</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>measures</b> should be taken...|$|E

40|$|Background: Physical {{activity}} (PA), {{physical fitness}} (PF), {{and even a}} few sedentary behaviors (SB) are strongly and independently linked to improved survival rate. However, key questions remain: what are the physiological interrelationships between SB, PA, and PF? How should we differently emphasize promoting PA, increasing PF with exercise, and decreasing SB among <b>other</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>measures?</b> What are the interrelationships of both PA and SB levels with drug treatment efficacy? Methods: To address these questions we developed an integrated patient-centric model combining physiology with epidemiological evidence to characterize the individual risk attached to PA level, PF, and SB. Epidemiological data were collected by extensive literature review. Results: Nine meta-analyses, 198 cohort studies (3. 8 million people), and 13 controlled trials were reviewed. 1. A high level of SB induces chronic stress and increases the risk of both chronic disease and mortality. 2. Vigorous PA increases PF and physiological reserve, thereby improving survival rate. This effect is notmediated by improved traditional risk factors. The risk for most individuals is a mix of high SB, low to mild PA, and low to mild PF. This model can improve the individualized prescription of PA modalities. Furthermore, the benefit of treatments such as statins or beta-blockers can be cancelled out if a decrease in PA or an increase in SB is induced by drug related side effects. Conclusions: To improve patient management both types of therapeutic interventions and dose should be carefully chosen for each individual in order to maintain/increase PA level while decreasing SB. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The primary {{goals of}} this report are to discuss {{measures}} to prevent suicides on commuter and metro rail systems, and to outline an approach for suicide prevention on rail systems. Based on existing literature and analysis of data obtained from the Metrolink system in Southern California, {{it was found that}} most suicides occur near station platforms and near access points to the track. Suicides occurred most frequently when relatively more trains were in operation and in areas of high population density. There {{do not appear to be}} suicide “hot spots” (e. g., linked to mental hospitals in the proximity, etc.), based on data analyzed for U. S. systems. The suicide prevention measures range from relatively inexpensive signs posting call-for-help suicide hotline information to costly platform barriers that physically prevent people from jumping onto tracks in front of trains. <b>Other</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>measures</b> fall within this range, such as hotlines available at high frequency suicide locations, or surveillance systems that can report possible suicide attempts and provide the opportunity for intervention tactics. Because of the relatively low number of suicides on rail systems, as compared to the overall number of suicides in general, a cost-effective strategy for preventing suicides on rail systems should be approached in a very focused manner. The prevention measures executed by the rail authorities should be focused on the suicides occurring on the rail systems themselves, while the broader problem of suicides should be left to community-based prevention efforts. Moreover, prevention measures, such as surveillance and response, could “piggyback” on surveillance and response systems used for other purposes on the rail systems to make such projects economically feasible...|$|E

40|$|Background: Significant {{progress}} has been made in reducing the malaria burden in the Asia Pacific region, which is aggressively pursuing a 2030 regional elimination goal. Moving from malaria control to elimination requires National Malaria Control Programmes (NMCPs) to target interventions at populations at higher risk, who are often not reached by health services, highly mobile and difficult to test, treat, and track with routine measures, and if undiagnosed, can maintain parasite reservoirs and contribute to ongoing transmission. Methods: A qualitative, free-text questionnaire was developed and disseminated among 17 of the 18 partner countries of the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network (APMEN). Results: All 14 countries that responded to the survey identified key populations at higher risk of malaria in their respective countries. Thirteen countries engage in the dissemination of malaria-related Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) materials. Eight countries engage in diagnostic screening, including of mobile and migrant workers, military staff, and/or overseas workers. Ten countries reported distributing or recommending the use of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) among populations at higher risk with fewer countries engaging in <b>other</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>measures</b> such as indoor residual spraying (IRS) (two countries), spatial repellents (four countries), chemoprophylaxis (five countries), and mass drug administration (MDA) (three countries). Though not specifically tailored to populations at higher risk, 11 countries reported using mass blood surveys as a surveillance tool and ten countries map case data. Most NMCPs lack a monitoring and evaluation structure. Conclusion: Countries in the Asia Pacific have identified populations at higher risk and targeted interventions to these groups but there is limited information on the effectiveness of these interventions. Platforms like APMEN offer the opportunity for the sharing of protocols and lessons learned related to finding, targeting and successfully clearing malaria from populations at higher risk. The sharing of programme data across borders may further strengthen national and regional efforts to eliminate malaria. This exchange of real-life experience is invaluable to NMCPs when scarce scientific evidence on the topic exists to aid decision-making and can further support NMCPs to develop strategies that will deliver a malaria-free Asia Pacific by 2030. ...|$|E
40|$|Infections with Schistosoma mansoni and soil-transmitted helminthes (STHs) {{are major}} public health {{problems}} in Ethiopia. However, information was scarce {{on the current}} status of these infections to guide an intervention in the study area. Therefore, this study was conducted to assess the prevalence of infections with S. mansoni and STHs and associated factors among school children in southern Ethiopia. This cross-sectional study investigated children who were attending the Finchawa and Tullo junior elementary schools and were residing along the shore of the lake Hawassa in January and February, 2015. A total of 374 students were selected using systematic random sampling technique. Data on socio-demography and related factors was collected using structured questionnaires. A single stool sample was collected from each child and processed using formol-ether concentration technique and examined microscopically for parasites' ova/larva. The prevalence of parasitic infection with one or more than one helminthiasis was found to be 67. 9 %. Seven different types of helminths were identified and the most prevalent parasites were Ascaris lumbricoides (44. 4 %), followed by S. mansoni (31 %), Trichuris trichiura (11 %), and hookworms (7. 7 %). The rate of infection with STHs was 52. 4 %. Single, double, triple and quadruple infections were 42. 2, 22. 5, 2. 4, and 0. 8 %, respectively. Children who practiced open-field defecation (AOR, 3. 6; 95 % CI 1. 6 - 8. 0; p = 0. 001) and had not always washed their hands before eating a meal (AOR, 5. 0; 95 %CI 2. 15 - 11. 7; p < 0. 001) were more infected with STHs. Moreover, the rate of S. mansoni infection was significantly higher among children who were attending the Finchawa school (AOR, 2. 13; 95 % CI 1. 31 - 3. 46; p = 0. 002), aged 11 - 15 years (AOR, 1. 97; 95 % CI 1. 22 - 3. 19; p = 0. 006), had swum in the lake Hawassa (AOR, 2. 73; 95 %CI 1. 20 - 6. 17; p = 0. 016), and had involved in irrigation-related activities (AOR, 1. 68; 95 %CI 1. 04 - 2. 71; p = 0. 034). The study showed high prevalence of STHs and moderate rate of schisotosomiasis.

40|$|Background: Immunization with RTS,S/AS 02 {{consistently}} protects some vaccinees against malaria {{infection in}} experimental challenges and in field trials. A brief immunization schedule against falciparum malaria would {{be compatible with}} the Expanded Programme on Immunization, or in combination with <b>other</b> <b>prevention</b> <b>measures,</b> interrupt epidemic malaria or protect individuals upon sudden travel to an endemic area. Methods: We conducted an open label, Phase 2 a trial of two different full dose schedules of RTS,S/AS 02 in 40 healthy malaria-naıve adults. Cohort 1 (n = 20) was immunized on a 0, 1, and 3 month schedule and Cohort 2 (n = 20) on a 0, 7, and 28 day schedule. Three weeks later, 38 vaccinees and 12 unimmunized infectivity controls underwent malaria challenge. Results: Both regimens had a good safety and tolerability profile. Peak GMCs of antibody to the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) were similar in Cohort 1 (78 μg/mL; 95 % CI: 45 — 134) and Cohort 2 (65 μg/mL; 95 % CI: 40 — 104). Vaccine efficacy for Cohort 1 was 45 % (95 % CI: 18 — 62 %) and for Cohort 2, 39 % (95 % CI: 11 — 56 %). Protected volunteers had a higher GMC of anti-CSP antibody (114 μg/mL) than did volunteers with a 2 -day delay (70 μg/mL) or no delay (30 μg/mL) in the time to onset of parasitemia (Kruskal—Wallis, p = 0. 019). A trend was seen for higher CSP-specific IFN-γ responses in PBMC from protected volunteers only in Cohort 1, but not in Cohort 2, for ex vivo and for cultured ELISPOT assays. Conclusion: In malaria-naıve adults, the efficacy of three-dose RTS,S/AS 02 regimens on either a 0, 1, and 3 month schedule or an abbreviated 0, 7, and 28 day schedule was not discernibly different from two previously reported trials of two-dose regimens given at 0, 1 month that conferred 47 % (95 % CI: − 19 to 76 %) protection and in another trial 42 % (95 % CI: 5 — 63 %). A strong association of CSP-specific antibody with protection against malaria challenge is observed and confirms similar observations made in other studies. Subsequent trials of adjuvanted RTS,S in African children and infants on a 0, 1, and 2 month schedule have demonstrated a favorable safety and efficacy profile...|$|E
