40|$|Among the {{negative}} consequences of video gaming disorder, decreased participation in <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> exercise has received little attention. This study aimed to assess the longitudinal association between video gaming disorder <b>and</b> the level <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> exercise in emerging adult men. A questionnaire was completed at baseline and 15 -month follow-up by a representative national sample of 4, 933 respondents. The seven items of the Game Addiction Scale were used to construct a latent variable representing video gaming disorder. Level <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> exercise was also self-reported. Cross-lagged path modeling indicated a reciprocal causality between video gaming disorder <b>and</b> the level <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> exercise, even after adjusting for a large set of confounders. These findings support the need for better promotion <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> exercise among emerging adults in order to contribute to the prevention of video gaming disorder, and to raise the level <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> exercise activity in addicted gamers...|$|R

5|$|During World WarII, Brundage {{wrote to}} other IOC members {{that he had}} no {{objection}} to Soviet involvement in international sports, with representation on the IOC, if the USSR joined the international sports federations (ISFs). The IOC required that an NOC be independent of the government of the territory which it represents; there were concerns a Soviet NOC would not be. This was a problem not unique to communist states; a number of Latin Americans countries were starting to bring the local NOCs into the political structure, with an official naming the NOC chair—who might even be the country's political leader. This mixture <b>of</b> <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> politics worried Brundage.|$|E

40|$|A demand {{exists for}} the {{increasing}} understanding of consumers’ motives and habits related to exercising <b>and</b> the influence <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> wellness technology on everyday lives. This study aims to shred {{light to the}} different types <b>of</b> users <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> wellness technology by examining the influential aspects <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> wellness technology and gamification. By thematically analyzing data from 16 indepth interviews, one group interview, and one set of observation, the study highlights the unique characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> wellness technology users by grouping them into ideal types that represents data as extensively as possible. An ideal type is an analytical construct to ascertain deviations and similarities of concrete cases in an individual phenomenon. This study discovered five ideal types <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> wellness technology users: On-Off Exercisers, Confidence Seekers, Intrinsic Exercisers, Performance Improvers, <b>and</b> <b>Sport</b> Addicts. The formed ideal types are the main theoretical contribution of this study. The main practical contribution follows from suggesting the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>sport</b> <b>and</b> wellness technologies that are most important for each ideal type and the related gamification aspects. The providers of these technologies can utilize these insights in determining the technologies most suitable for each ideal type...|$|R

5|$|The {{issue of}} male over-representation {{in terms of}} total number <b>of</b> <b>sports</b> <b>and</b> athletes is structural. In the United Kingdom, for example, more male athletes than female ones receive {{financial}} support. Sports officials rationalise this uneven distribution by claiming {{that there are more}} opportunities for men to win at the highest level than there are for women. The importance of being part of the Summer Olympics is illustrated by softball, and the benefits the sport derived from its inclusion. This included additional media coverage, especially during Olympic years. Olympic recognition plays an important part in getting sponsorship for local competitions around the world and providing new opportunities for females.|$|E
