Gerald places the letter in his pocket together with the newspaper account of the marriage of Claude and decides not to return to England but to remain {{and care for the}} lawful wife of his brother, whom he has grown to love fondly. Some time afterward he goes to his mine, wheeling the girl along with him. He wheels her to the mouth of the shaft and leaves her, after throwing his coat over the arm of her chair. His devotion has caused her to love him. She tries to change her position and the coat falls to the ground. She picks it up and the letter from England and the paper falls out. She reads the announcement of the marriage of Claude and then, feeling justified, she reads the letter announcing the death of Claude and of Gerald being heir to the estates and a gentleman. She reflects and then draws the forged letter from her bosom and sees that it was written after the announcement of the marriage. It is all revealed to her. The sacrifice of Gerald — the double duty, love and a desire to uphold the honor of the proud English family. She cries to Gerald but cannot make him hear. In her desperation she tries to wheel her chair down the slope and it is overturned. Her cries bring Gerald and when he comes she shows him the newspaper and the letter. He is silent. He cannot explain. She reaches <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> to him and is clasped to his heart." ...|$|E
500|$|During his journey, {{while waiting}} for a Mississippi steamboat, Uncle Tom first meets little Eva, who with her father is also taking the boat south. Tom is at once {{attracted}} to the beautiful little girl, and she in turn talks to the kindly old darkey. While looking at the boats, the little one accidentally falls into the swiftly flowing river and escapes drowning only through the bravery of Uncle Tom. He of all the crowd has the courage to jump in and rescue the little girl. Eva's father to reward Tom for his bravery, buys him from Legree, and once more Tom {{knows what it is}} to be treated kindly. He lives happily as little Eva's special bodyguard until the little one is seized with a sudden sickness and dies. She had become greatly attached to Uncle Tom, and the last act of her life was to present him with a little locket containing her picture. Once more Uncle Tom is sold and again falls into the hands of Simon Legree. He is taken to Legree's plantation in Mississippi, where he is overworked and ill-treated to the point of death. Just before he dies he presses to his lips the locket with the picture of his beloved little girl and in a vision sees her in the clouds holding <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> to him that he, too, may enter with her the pearly gates, inside of which all souls are equal, and all free. The comedy of the story is furnished by little Eva's Aunt Ophelia, a queer old lawyer named Marx, and his stubborn donkey, to say nothing of Topsy, a wicked little colored girl, who Aunt Ophelia tries hard to convert." ...|$|E
500|$|At Fotheringhay on {{the evening}} of 7 February 1587, Mary was told that she was to be {{executed}} the next morning. She spent the last hours of her life in prayer, distributing her belongings to her household, and writing her will and a letter to the King of France. The scaffold that was erected in the Great Hall was two feet high and draped in black. It was reached by two or three steps and furnished with the block, a cushion for her to kneel on and three stools, for her and the earls of Shrewsbury and Kent, who were there to witness the execution. The executioners (one named Bull and his assistant) knelt before her and asked forgiveness, as it was typical for the executioner to ask the pardon of the one being put to death. She replied, [...] "I forgive you with all my heart, for now, I hope, you shall make an end of all my troubles." [...] Her servants, Jane Kennedy and Elizabeth Curle, and the executioners helped Mary to remove her outer garments, revealing a velvet petticoat and a pair of sleeves in crimson-brown, the liturgical colour of martyrdom in the Catholic Church, with a black satin bodice and black trimmings. As she disrobed she smiled and said that she [...] "never had such grooms before... nor ever put off her clothes before such a company". She was blindfolded by Kennedy with a white veil embroidered in gold, knelt down on the cushion in front of the block, on which she positioned her head, and stretched <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b> Her last words were, [...] "In manus tuas, Domine, commendo spiritum meum" [...] ("Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit").|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving Christian depiction is a fresco of the 4th {{century in}} the Catacomb of Via Latina, Rome. [...] Four figures are on the bank, with Moses still in the water; the largest is the princess, who stretches <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms,</b> which the baby also does. [...] This gesture may derive from a textual variation found in Midrashic sources and the Aramaic translation of the Bible. In these [...] "she ... sent her female slave" [...] is changed to [...] "she stretched out her arm". [...] Though the context is Christian, many of the images here are of Old Testament subjects, and very likely reflect models adopted from an initially Jewish visual tradition, perhaps painted by artisans with sets of models for all religious requirements. [...] In the play Exagōgē by Ezekiel the Tragedian (3rd century BC), Moses recounts his finding, saying of the princess [...] "And straightway seeing me, she took me up", which may be reflected both in the New Testament Acts 7:20, and in artistic depictions where the princess is apparently first to grasp the ark.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nonsense, I must go!" [...] cried Mrs. Haggarty; and Edwards, {{putting on}} a {{resigned}} air, and giving <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> and face a further rub with <b>her</b> apron, held <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> to Mrs. Dennis, and the pair went upstairs.|$|R
6000|$|Christina slowly put <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> {{again and}} looked at the dimple in her elbow. [...] "Ah, he 's engaged?" [...] she {{repeated}} in the same tone. [...] "He never told me." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{door was}} closed, {{and the two}} women were once more alone. Philippa held <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>arms.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You undutiful person!" [...] but {{she held}} <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> {{and as he}} came to her, she leant her head against him, sobbing a little sob of {{infinite}} relief, as though fortitude found it much pleasanter to have a living column.|$|R
60|$|She {{suddenly}} held <b>out</b> both <b>her</b> <b>arms</b> {{over the}} breakfast-table.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come in," [...] {{she said}} mechanically, for a string {{in her brain}} seemed to be pulled by a {{persistent}} knocking at the door. With great slowness {{the door opened and}} a tall human being came towards <b>her,</b> holding <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> and saying: ...|$|R

60|$|Near by--so near, in fact, {{that she}} thought she might almost reach <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> and touch it--was Sugar-Loaf Mountain, round and high and big. And a little to the south was Backbone Mountain, and still farther along a peak called Crystal Mountain.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou dog!" [...] she said, in her terrible whisper, which {{sounded like}} the hiss of a snake, [...] "why didst thou hide this from me?" [...] And she {{stretched}} <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> and I {{thought that she was}} about to slay me.|$|R
60|$|Swanhild {{drew near}} the toad, and, shuddering, {{stretched}} <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm,</b> and {{then and there}} the red blood ran, and there they sealed their sisterhood.

60|$|Meanwhile our ghastly-looking guide {{had slipped}} behind a great boulder, {{and even then}} it {{occurred}} to me that her part in the tragedy being played, she, if it were a woman at all, was withdrawing herself while we met our miserable fate. But here I did her injustice, for she had, I suppose, come to save us from this very fate which without her presence we must most certainly have suffered. When the savages were within a few yards suddenly she appeared on the top of the boulder, looking like a second Witch of Endor, and stretched <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm.</b> Not a word did she speak, only stretched <b>out</b> <b>her</b> draped <b>arm,</b> but the effect was remarkable and instantaneous.|$|R
6000|$|... "The rope was so {{attached}} that {{by putting}} <b>out</b> <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> Irene could reach it. She seized it {{and made the}} lower end of it move more quickly on the ground.

6000|$|And {{as she sat}} on her {{bed that}} night, musing and half-undressed, she began to run one hand down <b>her</b> <b>arm</b> and scrutinize the soft flow of muscle under her skin.
