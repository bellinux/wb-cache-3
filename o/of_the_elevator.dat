5|$|At {{approximately}} 1:43p.m. CST (19:43 UTC), Hawkins {{stepped out}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> {{on the third}} floor and opened fire. He killed eight people and wounded four others over the course of six minutes, before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head near the customer service desk. He fired more than 30 rounds, striking 12 people. Six were killed instantly, one died before reaching the hospital, and another died 45 minutes after reaching the ER of another hospital.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} investigation, police had noted {{undisturbed}} human excrement {{in the elevator}} shaft, which Conley said he had left there before the murder. Use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> on the Monday after the murder crushed the excrement, which Slaton concluded was {{an indication that the}} elevator could not have been used as described by Conley, casting doubt on his testimony.|$|E
5|$|Early {{conceptual}} {{designs of}} the Pod itself were based, as it {{existed in the}} novel, {{on one of the}} primary shapes in geometry, a dodecahedron, or a twelve-sided figure. Eventually the Pod was modified to a spherical capsule that encases the traveler. Zemeckis and the production crew also made several visits to the Kennedy Space Center at Merritt Island adjacent to Cape Canaveral, where officials allowed them access to sites off-limits to most visitors. Filmmakers were also brought onto Launch Complex 39 before the launch of the space shuttle. There, they concentrated on the mechanics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> and the gantry area and loading arm. The resulting photographs and research were incorporated into the design of the machine's surrounding supports and gantry. Once the concept met with the filmmakers' approval, physical construction began on the sets for the Pod itself, the interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> and the gantry, which took almost four months to build. The rest of the effects were compiled digitally by Imageworks.|$|E

2500|$|In 2014 the Property and Facilities Committee {{approved}} {{a plan for}} a $10.4 million upgrade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building's <b>elevator</b> system. [...] This is the second major upgrade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> to have been implemented throughout the building's history. Originally manually controlled and later automated to Westinghouse Selectomatic in 1971, the system was completely modernized into Otis Compass destination dispatch in 2016.|$|R
50|$|During the 1970s the {{building}} was partially renovated including replacement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> and silver leaf in the lobby. It went into foreclosure and was purchased in 1990 by the Brooklyn-based Wybro brothers.|$|R
5|$|The {{cause of}} the fire could not be {{determined}} with certainty. One possibility is that a fire smouldered in the furniture store Inden under the hotel, and the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft in the morning provided an inflow of oxygen, causing the fire to spread. There is also a theory that the fire was set by burglars who tried to cover their tracks; however, {{there was no evidence}} of a burglary.|$|E
5|$|When World War I {{broke out}} in 1914, Khrushchev was exempt from {{conscription}} {{because he was a}} skilled metal worker. He was employed by a workshop that serviced ten mines, and he was involved in several strikes that demanded higher pay, better working conditions, and an end to the war. In 1914, he married Yefrosinia Pisareva, daughter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> operator at the Rutchenkovo mine. In 1915, they had a daughter, Yulia, and in 1917, a son, Leonid.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> {{was also}} {{essential to the}} emergence of the early skyscrapers, as office buildings taller than around six stories would have been impractical without them. Powered elevators were first installed in England during the 1830s and spread to U.S. factories and hotels by the 1840s. Elevators using hoist ropes, however, could only function effectively in low-rise buildings, and this limitation encouraged the introduction of the hydraulic elevator in 1870, even though early models contained dangerous design flaws. By 1876 these problems had been resolved, providing a solution for servicing the early skyscrapers.|$|E

5|$|The filming in {{downtown}} Chicago {{was conducted on}} Sundays {{during the summer of}} 1979, and much of the downtown was cordoned off from the public. Costs for filming the largest scene in the city's history totaled $3.5 million. Permission was given after Belushi and Aykroyd offered to donate $50,000 to charity after filming. Although the Bluesmobile was allowed to be driven through the Daley Center lobby, special breakaway panes were temporarily substituted for the normal glass in the building. The speeding car caused $7,650 in damage to 35 granite paver stones and a bronze air grill in the building. Interior shots <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> staircase, and assessor's office were all recreated in a film set for filming.|$|E
5|$|Alex realizes Geiger is {{controlling}} the ship. Armed with skeet guns, he goes with Juliano to Geiger's cabin. Geiger remotely detonates explosives inside the room. Annie and Dante, the ship's photographer, notice the people trapped behind the fire doors, and Annie uses a chainsaw {{to cut the}} door open and let them out. Meanwhile, Alex orders the navigator, Merced, to flood the ship and slow it down by opening the ballast doors. As the ship floods, Alex sees Drew on a monitor after she climbs out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> and runs to save her. Alex notices Geiger leaving the vault and holds him at gunpoint, but he escapes by closing the fire door in front of him. Using the ship's intercom, Geiger explains that he designed the ship's autopilot system and is taking revenge against the cruise line after being fired when he got sick from copper poisoning. Geiger again escapes from Alex by attaching a grenade to a door.|$|E
5|$|Cully and his thugs arrive as the McCoys try to leave. A violent gunfight ensues in the halls, stairwell, and elevator; all Cully's men {{are killed}} but one, who Doc allows to run away. Cully himself dies when Doc shoots the cables <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> {{he is in}} and it crashes {{to the bottom of}} the shaft. Rudy comes to his senses, follows Doc and Carol outside onto a fire escape, and shoots at them. Doc returns fire and kills him. With the police on the way, the couple hijack a pickup truck and force the driver, a {{cooperative}} old cowboy, to take them to Mexico. After crossing the border, Doc and Carol pay the cowboy $30,000 for his truck. Overjoyed, the cowboy heads back to El Paso on foot, while the couple continue into Mexico.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981, a new {{inclined}} elevator was installed.

5|$|Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she had in her pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E
5|$|The Framingham/Worcester line {{schedule}} was changed slightly in April 2012 {{to allow for}} temporary single-tracking through the station for construction. Actual station construction activity started in June 2012, and in August one track was cut, reducing the line to one track through the station. The platforms were installed in late November 2012; construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> shafts began in February 2013. A temporary ramp opened in June 2013 for passengers to use {{the east end of}} the future outbound platform; the old platform was demolished soon afterwards {{to make room for the}} west ends of the new platforms. The pedestrian bridge was lifted into place in August 2013, followed by the various roof and canopy elements. The second track was rebuilt in late September, followed by the remaining platform segments.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} {{is filled}} with ironwork, consisting of its stairs, elevator columns and associated tie beams, none of which supports {{the weight of the}} stonework. It was redesigned in 1958 to reduce congestion and improve the flow of visitors. Originally, visitors entered and exited the west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> on the observation floor, causing congestion. So the large landing at the 490-foot level was expanded to a full floor and the original spiral stair in the northeast corner between the 490- and 500-foot levels was replaced by two spiral stairs in the northeast and southeast corners. Now visitors exit the elevator on the observation floor, then walk down either spiral stair before reboarding the elevator for their trip back down.|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{flight and}} landing tests {{made on a}} group <b>of</b> conventional airplanes. <b>The</b> upward deflection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> {{was limited to the}} point where the airplanes could not be made to spin without <b>the</b> aid <b>of</b> power. With <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> travel thus limited, the airplane in every case had good lateral stability and good aileron effectiveness up to <b>the</b> highest angles <b>of</b> attack which could be obtained in a glide, although this was not true in any case without the limited control. All ordinary flight maneuvers could be performed with <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> displacement limited, but usually there was not sufficient control to get the tail down for a normal 3 -point landing...|$|R
50|$|Flying re-commenced on 16 February 2007, {{resuming}} {{flight tests}} which, so far, {{have proved to}} be satisfactory and certification is well advanced.

25|$|Grain {{elevators}} {{in small}} Canadian communities often had {{the name of}} the community painted on two sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> in large block letters, with the name <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> operator emblazoned on the other two sides. This made identification of the community easier for rail operators (and, incidentally, for lost drivers and pilots). The old community name would often remain on an elevator long after the town had either disappeared or been amalgamated into another community; the grain elevator at Ellerslie, Alberta, remained marked with its old community name until it was demolished, which took place more than twenty years after the village had been annexed by the City of Edmonton.|$|E
25|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} Civil Aeronautics Board, which concluded its probable cause was {{the loss of a}} 5/16 inch bolt which fell out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> control mechanism during the climb from Chicago, resulting in an abrupt pitch up followed by a stall and crash.|$|E
25|$|In 1943, the Lisbon Electric Tramway Ltd. {{solicited}} {{the city}} council to authorize the transfer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> to the Companhia da Carris.

50|$|After {{a series}} of proving flights at Hendon, 1456 was {{accepted}} by the RNAS and was flown to Manston for further trials. These revealed that despite a reduced balance area on <b>the</b> <b>elevators,</b> {{there was still a}} tail oscillation problem. A lack of directional stability caused by the increased forward side area was partly cured by adding a fixed fin but to find <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tail oscillation, the Admiralty called in Frederick Lanchester from the National Physics Laboratory. Lanchester agreed that simple structural weakness was not <b>the</b> root <b>of</b> <b>the</b> problem and that resonance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage was the probable cause. Static tests on the third prototype, 1457, which had a redesigned, stiffer, fuselage structure showed nothing. This aircraft had an amidships crew position and on 26 June, Lanchester was flown as an observer. The tail oscillations started at 80 mph; Lanchester observed that the tail was twisting by 15° to either side and deduced that the cause was asymmetric movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> right and left halves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators,</b> which were not rigidly linked but connected by long control cables. He recommended that <b>the</b> halves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> be connected, <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> balances removed and further bracing added between the lower longerons and the lower tailplane spar, measures which were wholly successful.|$|R
40|$|In {{high-rise}} buildings, elevators must {{be safely}} and efficiently moving people during daytime.
