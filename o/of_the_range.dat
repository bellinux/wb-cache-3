5|$|Breeding densities {{have been}} {{recorded}} as over 30pairs/km2 in northwestern Russia, depending on habitat, generally becoming lower, around 5pairs/km2 in the east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range.</b> Weather is also a factor, with an atypically high density of 7.4 birds/km2 being recorded in the Taymyr Peninsula in 1983.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of {{the west}} range – the cellarer's range – are extant. It was entered from the west by an outer parlour, {{projecting}} from the north end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range,</b> where {{members of the community}} received visitors. The prior lived on the upper floor which comprised a hall, chamber and chapel dedicated to Saint Hilda. The prior's rooms were probably located above the outer parlour, as was the pattern at other monasteries, accessing the cloister and the outside world. The largest surviving fragment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> comprises a cellarium or storehouse where supplies were kept. It is a vaulted undercroft of nine bays constructed from stone ashlar with its floor level below that of the cloister. It is relatively well-preserved and believed to have been divided by timber partitions which were later replaced in stone.|$|E
5|$|Heli-skiing gives {{ready access}} to many remote or off-piste ski routes in the Mont Blanc massif. Because heli-skiing is banned across France for {{environmental}} reasons, companies offering this service only operate on the Swiss and Italian sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Peninsular <b>Ranges</b> are in <b>the</b> Nearctic ecozone.

30|$|In addition, <b>the</b> {{heat balance}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shearer <b>ranging</b> arm was {{investigated}} {{and a special}} forced lubrication and cooling device was developed. <b>The</b> heat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shearer <b>ranging</b> arm comes mainly from the gears, bearings and stirring oil by gears. There are four main ways of heat dissipation for <b>the</b> shearer <b>ranging</b> arm: convective heat transfer between <b>the</b> <b>ranging</b> arm shell and air flow; heat removal by <b>the</b> cooling water <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranging</b> arms; heat absorption by <b>the</b> lube oil <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranging</b> arm; radial heat transfer between ranging arm and its connection devices.|$|R

5|$|Nine {{species of}} Perovskia are recognized. P.abrotanoides shares much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> of P.atriplicifolia, but is {{distinguished}} by its bipinnate leaves. Hybrids {{between these two}} species may occur naturally. Restricted to Turkestan in its native range, P.scrophularifolia is less upright; some forms have white flowers. The flowers of P.scabiosifolia are yellow.|$|E
5|$|Range {{queries are}} also straightforward. Once {{the ranks of}} the two values are known, the number of {{elements}} {{greater than or equal to}} the first value and less than the second is the difference of the two ranks. This count can be adjusted up or down by one according to whether the endpoints <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> should be considered to be part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> and whether the array contains keys matching those endpoints.|$|E
5|$|The {{historic}} {{range of}} the springbok stretched across the dry grasslands, bushlands, and shrublands of south-western and southern Africa; springbok migrated sporadically in southern parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range.</b> These migrations are rarely seen nowadays, but seasonal congregations can still be observed in preferred areas of short vegetation, such as the Kalahari desert.|$|E

5|$|West to east {{trending}} canyons provide {{easier access}} by foot {{into the heart}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> as no vehicular roads traverse the range except at Teton Pass, which is south of the park. Carved {{by a combination of}} glacier activity as well as by numerous streams, the canyons are at their lowest point along the eastern margin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> at Jackson Hole. Flowing from higher to lower elevations, the glaciers created more than a dozen U-shaped valleys throughout the range. Cascade Canyon is sandwiched between Mount Owen and Teewinot Mountain to the south and Symmetry Spire to the north and is situated immediately west of Jenny Lake. North to south, Webb, Moran, Paintbrush, Cascade, Death and Granite Canyons slice through Teton Range.|$|E
5|$|A. p. kleinschmidti is {{sometimes}} {{merged with the}} nominate form, A. p. petrosus.

5|$|Adding to the problems, the zip fuel {{program was}} {{canceled}} in 1959. After burning, the fuel turned into liquids and solids that increased wear on moving turbine engine components. Although the B-70 {{was intended to}} use zip only in the afterburners, and thus avoid this problem, the enormous cost of the zip program for such limited gains led to its cancellation. This by itself was not a fatal problem, however, as newly developed high-energy fuels like JP-6 were available to make {{up some of the}} difference. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> lost in the change from zip fuel was restored by filling one of the two bomb bays with a fuel tank. However, another problem arose when the F-108 program was canceled in September 1959, which ended the shared development that benefited the B-70 program.|$|E
5|$|After {{crossing}} the Atlantic Ocean on the RMS Lusitania to London, where they gathered the supplies {{they would need}} for their expedition, Beebe and his team traveled across the Mediterranean Sea to Egypt, through the Suez Canal, and across the Indian Ocean to Ceylon, where they began their task of documenting the native wildfowl. From Ceylon they traveled to Calcutta, {{with the goal of}} capturing the species of pheasants which live only in the Himalayas. By this point Beebe was beginning to be in conflict with Horsfall, who was unaccustomed to such expeditions. After Beebe had finished his documentation in the eastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range,</b> Horsfall refused to accompany Beebe in the western part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range,</b> causing Beebe to leave him in the town of Jorepokhri and continue his work in the Western Himalayas without him. Horsfall rejoined them in Calcutta, from which they sailed to Indonesia. The next ship took them to Singapore, where Beebe established a base of operations for the next stage of his expedition.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{described}} subspecies, a 1989 morphometrical {{study by}} Humphrey and Setzer separated only two—O. p. natator from much of Florida (including O. p. coloratus, O. p. planirostris, O. p. sanibeli, and O. p. floridanus, {{as well as}} O. p. argentatus) and O. p. palustris from the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>range</b> (including O. p. texensis). However, Whitaker and Hamilton in their 1998 book on the Mammals of the Eastern United States recognized O. p. planirostris and O. p. sanibeli as separate subspecies, but merged all others into O. p. palustris, and placed O.argentatus as a separate species; their classification was based on their emphasis of overwater gaps as agents of biological diversification and a critique of shortcomings in Humphrey and Setzer's study, not on a reanalysis of the data.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> {{precipitation}} of {{any area}} {{is affected by}} elevation, and topography influences temperature within elevation <b>ranges.</b> <b>The</b> higher the elevation, the lower the temperatures, and with lower temperatures come increased precipitation. <b>The</b> highest point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ranges</b> is Mt. San Gorgonio (11,503 feet) in the San Bernardino Mountains at <b>the</b> eastern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ranges.</b> <b>The</b> southeastern part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Transverse <b>Ranges</b> can be considered to have a desert climate. Mountain ranges can cause a rain shadow effect, when air flow inland from the ocean and it rises, it begins to cool and after it reaches <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain it becomes warm and evaporates. This is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reasons for the dry conditions in <b>the</b> Transverse <b>Ranges</b> that are furthest from <b>the</b> coast. <b>The</b> <b>Ranges</b> are also affected by the Santa Ana winds, a regional wind system created when air is forced from a high pressure to a low pressure, causing air to move from inland towards the ocean. These dry winds usually originate at <b>the</b> eastern end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ranges.</b>|$|R
