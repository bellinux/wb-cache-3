5|$|Gods were worshiped in cult temples {{administered}} by priests {{acting on the}} king's behalf. At {{the center of the}} temple was the cult statue in a shrine. Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship. Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials. Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos. After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods.</b> As a result, priests developed a system of oracles to communicate the will <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> directly to the people.|$|E

5|$|Temples, {{where the}} state rituals were carried out, were filled with images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods.</b> The most {{important}} temple image was the cult statue in the inner sanctuary. These statues were usually less than life-size, and made of the same precious materials that were said to form the gods' bodies. Many temples had several sanctuaries, each with a cult statue representing one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> in a group such as a family triad. The city's primary god was envisioned as its lord, employing many of the residents as servants in the divine household that the temple represented. The gods residing in the temples of Egypt collectively represented the entire pantheon. But many deities—including some important gods {{as well as those}} that were minor or hostile—were never given temples of their own, although some were represented in the temples of other gods.|$|E

5|$|The text is a royal {{building}} inscription, a genre {{which had}} no equivalent in Old Persian literature. It illustrates how Cyrus co-opted local traditions and symbols to legitimize his conquest and control of Babylon. Many elements of the text were drawn from long-standing Mesopotamian themes of legitimizing rule in Babylonia: the preceding king is reprimanded and he is proclaimed to have been abandoned by the gods for his wickedness; the new king has gained power through the divine will of the gods; the new king rights the wrongs of his predecessor, addressing {{the welfare of the}} people; the sanctuaries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> are rebuilt or restored, offerings to the gods are made or increased and the blessings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gods</b> are sought; and repairs are made to the whole city, in the manner of earlier rightful kings.|$|E
