5|$|The {{strategy}} guide {{also received}} criticism; it urged buyers to log onto an online site {{to gain the}} information, instead of providing it within the actual guide. The book's given links are no longer accessible on the PlayOnline website. Tetra Master was seen by GameSpot as inferior and confusing compared to Final Fantasy VIIIs minigame Triple Triad, as the rules for it were <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> explained {{in the game and}} there were very few rewards earned from playing it despite its expansive nature.|$|E
25|$|History between 1830 and 1840 is <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> documented.|$|E
25|$|The series saw {{the return}} of the cliffhanger, with six of the twelve episodes divided into two-parters. Moffat has stated that the two-part stories aren't as {{connected}} as similar stories in previous series, but instead are quite different and <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> related.|$|E

25|$|By {{then also}} an anticapitalist, he {{identified}} in Jewry the common source of economic liberalism and communism, both seen as internationalist forces manipulated by a Judaic conspiracy. As {{an opponent of}} modernization and materialism, he <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> indicated that his movement's economic goals implied a non-Marxian form of collectivism, and presided over his followers' initiatives to set up various cooperatives.|$|E
25|$|In the Gathas, Zoroaster {{sees the}} human {{condition}} as the mental struggle between aša (truth) and druj (lie). The cardinal concept of aša—which is highly nuanced and <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> translatable—is at the foundation of all Zoroastrian doctrine, including that of Ahura Mazda (who is aša), creation (that is aša), existence (that is aša) and as the condition for free will.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the great}} epics of European {{literature}} include episodes that occur in Hell. In the Roman poet Virgil's Latin epic, the Aeneid, Aeneas descends into Dis (the underworld) to visit his father's spirit. The underworld is <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> described, with one unexplored path leading to the punishments of Tartarus, while the other leads through Erebus and the Elysian Fields.|$|E

25|$|Malagasy has {{a complex}} system of deixis (these, those, here, there, etc.), with seven degrees of {{distance}} {{as well as}} evidentiality across all seven. The evidential dimension is prototypically visible vs. non-visible referents; however, the non-visible forms {{may be used for}} visible referents which are <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> identified or have unclear boundaries, whereas the visible forms are used for non-visible referents when these are topical to the conversation.|$|E
25|$|Problem 1 – If the photon has a short wavelength, and therefore, a large momentum, the {{position}} {{can be measured}} accurately. But the photon scatters in a random direction, transferring a large and uncertain amount of momentum to the electron. If the photon has a long wavelength and low momentum, the collision does not disturb the electron's momentum very much, but the scattering will reveal its position <b>only</b> <b>vaguely.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{boundary}} between Canada and the United States along the Alaska Panhandle was <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> defined then (see Alaska boundary dispute). There were overlapping land claims from the United States' purchase of Alaska from Russia in 1867 and British claims along the coast. Canada requested a survey after British Columbia united {{with it in}} 1871, but the idea {{was rejected by the}} United States as being too costly, given the area's remoteness, sparse settlement, and limited economic or strategic interest.|$|E
50|$|By 7 July, {{governor}} Mazhar {{heard from}} his Istanbul superiors, receiving <b>only</b> <b>vague</b> instructions to retain public order pending conclusion of negotiations with Austria-Hungary.

50|$|Homosexuality in Ancient Egypt is a passionately disputed subject within Egyptology: {{historians and}} egyptologists alike debate {{what kind of}} view the Ancient Egyptians society fostered about homosexuality.

25|$|The {{opening and}} credits {{sequences}} of most anime television episodes {{are accompanied by}} Japanese pop or rock songs, often by reputed bands. They may be written with the series in mind, but are also aimed at the general music market, and therefore often allude <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> {{or not at all}} to the themes or plot of the series. Pop and rock songs are also sometimes used as incidental music ("insert songs") in an episode, often to highlight particularly important scenes.|$|E
25|$|It {{has already}} been {{discussed}} that qin music has a rhythm, {{and that it is}} <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> indicated in the tablature. Though there is an amount of guesswork involved, the tablature has clues to indicate rhythm, such as repeating motifs, indication of phrases or how the notation is arranged. Throughout the history of the qinpu, we see many attempts to indicate this rhythm more explicitly, involving devices like dots to make beats. Probably, one of the major projects to regulate the rhythm to a large scale was the compilers of the Qinxue Congshu tablature collection of the 1910s to 1930s. The construction of the written tablature was divided into two columns. The first was further divided into about three lines of a grid, each line indicating a varied combination of lyrics, gongche tablature, se tablature, pitch, and/or beats depending on the score used. The second column was devoted to qin tablature.|$|E
25|$|D'Aspré {{received}} a command {{in the army}} of Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este and Karl Mack von Lieberich {{at the beginning of}} the War of the Third Coalition. He led a brigade-sized unit of three and one-half infantry battalions and six cavalry squadrons. When the army of Emperor Napoleon I of France reached the Danube on 6 October, Mack realized that his army was in danger of being cut off from Vienna. At that time, he made the questionable decision to assemble the corps of Franz Jellacic, Franz von Werneck, and Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg near Ulm, renouncing any idea of retreating south to the Tyrol. On 8 October, he issued orders for his army to concentrate at Günzburg downstream from Ulm. He hoped to put his troops in a position to sever Napoleon's supply line back to France. At this time, Napoleon was <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> aware of the Austrian army's position.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{non-self}} managed funds {{only provide}} very minimal {{information to the}} account holders about how their money has been invested.

50|$|Henry Wells {{was said}} to have a horrible temper, and he had been {{involved}} in several brawls. People said he constantly carried a straight razor, and was not afraid to use it.

25|$|The 83 × 67cm (33 × 26 in) {{painting}} shows a half-length {{portrait of}} the painter Édouard Manet. In this self-portrait as painter he depicted himself as a stylish Boulevardier {{in front of a}} dark background. The depicted wears a black top hat and a brown jacket, under which is a white shirt, of which only the collar can be seen. The neckline of the suit jacket covers a black silk tie which is affixed by a tie pin. In the right, <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> depicted hand he holds a long wooden brush with red paint on the tip; the left hand holds a painting palette with about three more brushes. No further accessories are shown. The figure is lit from the left by which the shadows beneath the left arm and the right half of the face are created. His pose is slightly turned to the right, so that the right half of the body is darker than the forward, left half. The painter's gaze is directed forwards at the viewer.|$|E
500|$|Around this time, Bellette {{also held}} {{a show in}} Melbourne, which {{included}} some black-and-white landscape studies {{as well as some}} of her classical Greek subjects. Arnold Shore, art critic for The Argus, drew a contrast between the two groups of works. He thought that one of the landscapes [...] "sets the heart singing with its lovely tone, pattern and sense of place". Continuing, he noted that the landscapes and some other works [...] "attain at their best a standard <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> suggested when the painter concerned herself too much with striving after a new treatment of ancient Grecian ideals." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{lengthening}} {{has received}} {{a number of different}} explanations within the context of theoretical phonology. All accounts agree that some property of the fortis sonorant is being transferred to the preceding vowel, but the details about what property that is vary from researcher to researcher. [...] argue that the fortis sonorant is tense (a term <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> defined phonetically) and that this tenseness is transferred to the vowel, where it is realized phonetically as vowel length and/or diphthongization. [...] argues that the triggering consonant is underlyingly associated with a unit of syllable weight called a mora; this mora then shifts to the vowel, creating a long vowel or a diphthong. [...] expands on that analysis to argue that the fortis sonorants have an advanced tongue root (that is, the bottom of the tongue is pushed upward during articulation of the consonant) and that diphthongization is an articulatory effect of this tongue movement.|$|E
50|$|Vijayapala {{was born}} to the Chandela ruler Vidyadhara. No {{inscription}} from his reign is available. He is mentioned in several Chandela inscriptions, {{but most of these}} contain <b>only</b> <b>vague</b> eulogies. For example, the Mau stone inscription declares that he killed all wicked men {{and put an end to}} the Kali Yuga.|$|R
5000|$|... 'InfoWatch' {{software}} had <b>only</b> <b>vague</b> prospects at {{the time}} of the spin-off and was an albatross around 'Kaspersky Lab’s neck. Unlike 'Kaspersky Lab', the technological solutions and product line of the new company were initially targeted at large and medium enterprises, starting from 300 workstations, rather than small businesses and retailers.|$|R

500|$|Leslie seeks {{advice from}} city planner Mark Brendanawicz (Paul Schneider), who feels {{the project would}} prove {{practically}} impossible due to the logistics and bureaucratic red tape, but Leslie is undeterred. Leslie later fondly tells the documentary crew that she and Mark made love five years ago, but Mark <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> recalls the encounter. Leslie, Tom and uninterested intern April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) visit Ann and meet Andy, a lazy and demanding musician whom she is forced to wait on and support financially. Afterward, Leslie and Ann visit the pit, which Leslie accidentally falls into as Tom and April make fun of her. Ann quickly provides medical assistance. Afterward, Leslie leaves, and Ann tells the documentary crew, [...] "She's a little doofy, but she's sweet". Some time later, Leslie asks her boss Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) for permission to form an exploratory committee for the pit project. Ron initially refuses, but eventually agrees to consider it so that Leslie will leave his office. Ron explains {{that he does not}} want the Parks Department to build any parks because he believes government is a waste of money, and that all government should be privatized and run by corporations for profit. Leslie repeatedly pesters Ron about the park project, but he refuses to commit.|$|E
500|$|... "Hellbound" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B". John Keegan, writing for Critical Myth, gave the episode a positive review and complimented its exploration of Reyes' character. He rated it an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "overall, a wonderful unexpected {{look into the}} underlying motivations of a character that, until now, has been <b>only</b> <b>vaguely</b> drawn for the audience. Thankfully it is completely consistent {{with what we have}} seen before". Keegan added that the [...] "greatest drawback may be that we are unlikely to see this theme explored much further, since this is now officially the final season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the entry's plot—comparing it to the first season episode [...] "Squeeze" [...] and the fourth season episode [...] "The Field Where I Died"—calling the writing [...] "delightfully subtle". They praised Amann's misdirection, noting that the episode contains several red herrings. Shearman and Pearson also praised the episode's effects, calling the skinless bodies [...] "the high point of the series' trading in gore". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode [...] "unexpectedly entertaining" [...] and praised the script's attempts to shed more light on Reyes' character.|$|E

50|$|Like fangames, dōjin soft {{frequently}} use {{characters from}} existing games, anime, or manga.

50|$|When it {{came time}} to {{duplicate}} the oak doors of the entrance, the builders had <b>only</b> <b>vague</b> descriptions of the detailed carving. Because people (especially wedding parties) often posed for photos outside the church doors, they issued an appeal for old photographs and the response—which included entire wedding albums—allowed artisans to recreate the original doors.|$|R
