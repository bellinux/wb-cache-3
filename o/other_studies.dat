5|$|Records of otters preying upon beavers (Castor canadensis) vary; it {{has been}} {{reported}} in the southern boreal forest of Manitoba.

5|$|Aspirin's {{popularity}} declined {{after the}} development of acetaminophen/paracetamol in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1962. In the 1960s and 1970s, John Vane and others discovered the basic mechanism of aspirin's effects, while clinical trials and <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> from the 1960s to the 1980s established aspirin's efficacy as an anti-clotting agent that {{reduces the risk of}} clotting diseases. Aspirin sales revived considerably in the last decades of the twentieth century, and remain strong in the twenty-first with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{findings}} of these and <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> in the early 1970s, the current consensus is that the use of methoxyflurane should be restricted only to healthy individuals, in situations where it offers specific advantages and even then, only at dosages less than 2.5MAC hours. Partly because of these warnings, but also because of the development of newer volatile anesthetics such as enflurane, isoflurane, desflurane and sevoflurane, the clinical use of methoxyflurane as a general anesthetic in humans was largely abandoned in the mid-1970s.|$|E

5|$|Drosophila melanogaster, a fruit fly, {{has long}} {{been used as a}} model {{organism}} in research because of the ease with which it can be bred and reared in the laboratory, its small genome, and {{the fact that many of}} its genes have counterparts in higher eukaryotes. A large number of genetic studies have been undertaken based on this species; these have had a profound impact on the study of gene expression, gene regulatory mechanisms and mutation. <b>Other</b> <b>studies</b> have investigated physiology, microbial pathogenesis and development among other research topics. The studies on dipteran relationships by Willi Hennig helped in the development of cladistics, techniques that he applied to morphological characters but now adapted for use with molecular sequences in phylogenetics.|$|E
5|$|Each {{of these}} {{positive}} outcomes requires some ability to forgo short-term reward {{in favor of}} a higher payoff in the future. The ability to delay gratification also appears to be a buffer against rejection sensitivity (the tendency to be anxious when anticipating interpersonal rejection). In a 20-year follow-up of the marshmallow experiment, individuals with vulnerability to high rejection sensitivity who had shown strong delay of gratification abilities as preschoolers had higher self-esteem and self-worth and more adaptive coping skills, in comparison to the individuals who had high rejection sensitivity but low delay of gratification as four-year-olds. These compelling longitudinal findings converge with <b>other</b> <b>studies</b> showing a similar pattern: The ability to resist temptation early in life translates to persistent benefits across settings.|$|E
5|$|Found on or {{near the}} bottom, the blackmouth {{catshark}} favors a muddy habitat. There is little evidence for segregation by sex. A number of studies in the northern and western Mediterranean have reported that adults occur deeper than juveniles. <b>Other</b> <b>studies</b> though have found no such pattern. It is possible that areas such as the waters off southern France offer a habitat suitable for sharks of all ages. Another explanation with some scientific support is that adults are most common at intermediate depths, while young sharks are restricted to shallower water and both adults and juveniles are found in deeper water. If true, the age-depth inconsistencies observed from previous research could have resulted from incomplete depth sampling.|$|E
