5|$|Diplodocids like Apatosaurus {{are often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.|$|E
5|$|Immature {{birds have}} duller and less demarcated plumage.

5|$|In non-breeding plumage, the {{nominate}} has greyish-black upper parts, cap, nape, and hindneck, {{with the}} colour {{on the upper}} portion of the latter being contained in a vertical stripe. The dark colour of the cap reaches below the eye and can be seen, diffused, to the ear-coverts. Behind the ear-coverts on the sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck,</b> there are white ovals. The rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> is grey to brownish-grey in colour and has white that varies in amount. The breast is white, and the abdomen is whitish.

5|$|Matthew Cobley et al. (2013) dispute this, {{finding that}} large muscles and {{cartilage}} would have limited movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck.</b> They state the feeding ranges for sauropods like Diplodocus were smaller than previously believed, {{and the animals}} may have had to move their whole bodies around to better access areas where they could browse vegetation. As such, they might have spent more time foraging to meet their minimum energy needs. The conclusions of Cobley etal. are disputed by Taylor, who analyzed the amount and positioning of intervertebral cartilage to determine the flexibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>neck</b> of Apatosaurus and Diplodocus. He found that the neck of Apatosaurus was very flexible.|$|E

5|$|Spontaneous {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{is thought}} to result from increased pressures in the lung that cause alveoli to rupture.

5|$|The {{long neck}} of Dinocephalosaurus {{probably}} served a functional role.

Juvenile comb ducks are bulkier than whistling ducks and have a dark cap to the head. In South America and Africa, juvenile white-faced whistling ducks are separable from fulvous by their dark crowns, barred flanks and chestnut breasts.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{subspecies}} are recognized, {{there are}} morphological differences in wood turtles between areas.

Johann Fischer von Waldheim described this taxon as Corvus soemmerringii in 1811, noting its differences from populations in western Europe.
