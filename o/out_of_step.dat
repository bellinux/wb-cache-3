5|$|Alexander and {{his paper}} vocally {{supported}} the old governing {{class of the}} former Confederate States of America and were rabid in {{their opposition to the}} policies of Reconstruction imposed upon the South by the Northern-based Republican Party. Such views were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> with the majority of Oregonians, however, with the Republicans coming to dominate Oregon politics during {{the last quarter of the}} 19thcentury. Alexander was forced to liquidate his stake in his money-losing newspaper in 1868.|$|E

Undaunted, he stages a show, complete with a gospel choir, at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, and against all odds it is a huge success.|$|E

For example, at the 1988 Winter Olympics, both men and ladies were required to do a double flip as the jump <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>steps,</b> and include a double loop in the jump combination. Beginning in the 1998-99 season, men were allowed to do a triple as the required axel jump and include a quadruple jump in the short program.|$|R

5|$|Historically, Ashland {{has been}} {{something}} of a political outlier in southwest Oregon. In the presidential election of 1860, Ashland favored Abraham Lincoln while its neighbors strongly preferred pro-slavery candidates. In the early 1900s, Ashland voters supported women's suffrage and prohibition, generally <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> {{with the rest of the}} region. In more recent elections, liberal Ashland has supported tax levies and environmental regulations opposed by voters elsewhere in Jackson and nearby counties. Critics sometimes refer to the city as the People's Republic of Ashland.|$|E
5|$|When Wilson {{proposed}} {{establishment of}} a League of Nations, with the League's charter part of the Treaty of Versailles, Taft expressed public support. He was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> with his party, whose senators were not inclined to ratify the treaty. Taft's subsequent flip-flop {{on the issue of}} whether reservations to the treaty were necessary angered both sides, destroying any remaining influence he had with the Wilson administration, and causing some Republicans to call him a Wilson supporter and a traitor to his party. The Senate refused to ratify the Versailles pact.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Rix Nicholas {{returned}} to Australia, and in 1928 she married Edgar Wright, {{whom she had}} met during her travels in the early 1920s. The couple settled at Delegate, New South Wales; their only child, a son named Rix Wright, was born in 1930. Though she continued to paint significant works including The Summer House and The Fair Musterer, Rix Nicholas, a staunch critic of modernism who was disdainful {{of the works of}} emerging major artists such as Russell Drysdale and William Dobell, grew <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> with trends in Australian art. Her pictures remained didactic, portraying an Australian pastoral ideal, and reviews of her exhibitions grew more uneven. She held her last solo show in 1947. Rix Nicholas remained at Delegate until her death in 1961. Her works are held in most major Australian collections, including the Art Gallery of South Australia, Australian War Memorial, National Gallery of Australia, National Gallery of Victoria, and the Queensland Art Gallery.|$|E

5|$|On days of {{particular}} religious significance, the daily rituals were replaced with festival observances. Different festivals occurred at different intervals, though most were annual. Their timing {{was based on}} the Egyptian civil calendar, which most of the time was far <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> with the astronomical year. Thus, while many festivals had a seasonal origin, their timing lost its connection with the seasons. Most festivals took place at a single temple, but others could involve two or more temples or an entire region of Egypt; a few were celebrated throughout the country. In the New Kingdom and later, the festival calendar at a single temple could include dozens of events, so it is likely that most of these events were observed only by the priests. In those festivals that involved a procession outside the temple, the local population also gathered to watch and to celebrate. These were the most elaborate temple ceremonies, accompanied by the recitation of hymns and the performance of musicians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the image}} {{selected}} by McCartney, the group {{walk across the}} street in single file from left to right, with Lennon leading, followed by Starr, McCartney, and Harrison. McCartney is barefoot and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> with the other members. Apart from Harrison, the group are wearing suits designed by Tommy Nutter. To the left of the picture, parked next to the zebra crossing, is a white Volkswagen Beetle which belonged to one of the people living in the block of flats across from the recording studio. After the album was released, the number plate (LMW 281F) was stolen repeatedly from the car. In 1986, the car was sold at auction for £2,530 and in 2001 was on display in a museum in Germany. The man standing on the pavement {{to the right of the}} picture is Paul Cole (7 July 1911– 13 February 2008), an American tourist unaware he had been photographed until he saw the album cover months later. On the original cover, McCartney holds a cigarette; in 2003 several US poster companies airbrushed this cigarette out of the image, without permission from either Apple or McCartney.|$|E
5|$|The European Champion Clubs' Cup {{was founded}} in 1955 and was renamed the UEFA Champions League in 1992. Malmö FF first entered the {{competition}} in 1964–65, qualifying {{by virtue of their}} position {{at the top of the}} Allsvenskan table midway through the 1964 season. As Allsvenskan is played between April and October of each year, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>step</b> with most European leagues, modern practice sees each season's Allsvenskan champions qualify for the UEFA Champions League competition starting in August the following year. Malmö FF's most notable achievement in this competition, and in all European tournaments, is reaching the final at the end of the 1978–79 season. In the 2014–15 season the side passed the qualifying rounds for the first time since the competition was re–branded. The following is a complete list of matches played by Malmö FF in the European Cup and the UEFA Champions League; it includes the season of the tournament, the stage, the opponent club and its country, the date, the venue and the score. It is up to date as of the 2017–18 season.|$|E
