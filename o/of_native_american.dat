5|$|The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) {{passed a}} {{resolution}} calling {{for the end of}} the use <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> names, images, and mascots in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue is}} often {{discussed}} in the media {{only in terms of}} the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a fuller understanding of the history and context of the use <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> names and images, and the reasons why use of such names and images by sports teams should be eliminated. Social science research says that sports mascots and images, rather than being mere entertainment, are important symbols with deeper psychological and social effects. The accumulation of research on the harm done has led to over 115 professional organizations representing civil rights, educational, athletic, and scientific experts adopting resolutions or policies that state that the use <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> names and/or symbols by non-native sports teams is a form of ethnic stereotyping that promotes misunderstanding and prejudice which contributes to other problems faced by Native Americans.|$|E
5|$|A legal {{claim of}} {{discrimination}} rests upon a group agreeing {{that a particular}} term or practice is offensive, thus opponents of mascot change often point to individuals claiming Native American heritage {{who say they are}} not offended. This raised the difficulty <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> identity in the United States, also an evolving controversy.|$|E
50|$|However, other {{scholars}} {{point out that}} the Catholic Church often defended the rights <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> For example, Jesuits devoted themselves to the interests <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{exclusion}} <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> from citizenship {{was eventually}} eliminated by the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924. At the time, two thirds <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> had already achieved citizenship.|$|R
25|$|In the United States, <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>of</b> the <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> racial type can be stereotyped as Mexicans or Latin American. This {{is because}} Mexicans <b>of</b> predominantly/significant <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> ancestry {{are a large}} group <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> in the United States.|$|R
5|$|A {{study done}} by the Emory University Goizueta Business School {{indicates}} that the growing unpopularity <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> mascots is a financial drain for professional teams, losing money compared to more popular animal mascots.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a human skull was {{unearthed}} {{along the}} same stretch of riverbank during excavations in search of additional evidence. Forensic pathologists eventually determined that it belonged to a woman, possibly <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> ancestry.|$|E
5|$|In the past, some ceremonialists used face paint, {{performed}} {{dances with}} religious significance, and used objectionable terms regarding Native Americans. The OA no longer allows these practices, stating {{that this is}} in recognition of preferences <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> groups that found such actions offensive.|$|E
5000|$|The {{decision}} in United States v. Kagama {{led to the}} new idea that [...] "protection" [...] <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> could justify intrusion into intratribal affairs. The Supreme Court and Congress were given unlimited authority with which to force assimilation and acculturation <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> into American society.|$|R

5|$|Native American {{names and}} images {{are used by}} teams in other countries, {{generally}} those playing American-style sports and copying the imagery of American teams. Several are in Austria, Germany, and Sweden, which also have a tradition <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> hobbyists.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> settlements {{dates back}} as far as 3000 BC; the Jeffers Petroglyphs site in southwest Minnesota contains carvings thought to date to the Late Archaic Period (3000 BC to 1000 BC). Around 700 BC, burial mounds were first created, and the practice continued until the arrival of Europeans, when 10,000 such mounds dotted the state.|$|E
5|$|Because many Native Americans {{were forced}} to move to Oklahoma when White {{settlement}} in North America increased, Oklahoma has much linguistic diversity. Mary Linn, {{an associate professor of}} anthropology at the University of Oklahoma and the associate curator <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> languages at the Sam Noble Museum, notes Oklahoma also has high levels of language endangerment.|$|E
40|$|While {{many forms}} of {{institutionalized}} discrimination <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> have ended, {{there is still a}} powerful legacy of past discrimination and trauma. This manifests itself in levels of perceived discrimination, crime and substance abuse, and the depiction <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> in the media as mascots...|$|R
5000|$|The legal {{position}} <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> {{during the time}} of the case could be compared to that of a Minor. Minors are citizens with guardians and have special laws applying only to them. <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> were set to have congress as a guardian. [...] This status stemmed from the view <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> as an inferior race which was put into legal terms in the case Johnson v. M'Intosh. [...] <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> were viewed as unable to resist or handle alcohol. [...] Congress viewed United States citizenship as a method <b>of</b> civilizing <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> [...] The treatment of citizenship in United States v. Nice implies the inferiority of Indians and allows for individual liberties <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> to be restricted based on such an implication.|$|R

5|$|Edwards won an {{unlikely}} 1826 election to become Governor of Illinois. Conflict with the legislature over state bank regulations marked Edwards' administration, {{as did the}} pursuit of Indian removal. As governor or territorial governor he twice sent Illinois militia against Native Americans, in the War of 1812 and the Winnebago War, and signed treaties for the cession <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> land. Edwards returned to private life when his term ended in 1830 and died of cholera two years later.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, {{an outfit}} worn by model Karlie Kloss, which was {{reminiscent}} <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> attire, sparked controversy {{due to its}} alleged stereotypical depiction of Native Americans. Victoria's Secret released a statement of apology shortly after, saying that they will remove it from future advertisements and the broadcast. Kloss apologized on her Twitter account for the outfit and expressed her support for the outfit's removal in the broadcast.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{returning}} to America after the war, some <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> soldiers suffered from PTSD and unemployment. Following the war, many <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> found themselves living in cities {{rather than on}} reservations. In 1940, only 5 percent <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> lived in cities. By 1950, this number had ballooned to nearly 20 percent <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> living in urban areas off of reservations.|$|R
5|$|Indian Wars is {{the name}} {{generally}} used in the United States to describe a series of conflicts between the colonial or {{federal government and the}} native people of North America. The wars, which ranged from the 17th-century to the early 1900s, generally resulted in the opening <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> lands to further colonization, the conquest of American Indians and their assimilation, or forced relocation to Indian reservations.|$|E
5|$|Some of Churchill's Native American critics, such as Vernon Bellecourt (White Earth Ojibwe) and Suzan Shown Harjo (Southern Cheyenne-Muscogee Creek), {{argue that}} his {{assertion}} <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> ancestry without {{the ability to}} prove it might constitute misrepresentation and grounds for termination. The University {{has said that it}} does not hire on the basis of ethnicity.|$|E
5|$|Support for {{continued}} use of the name {{has come from the}} team's owners and a majority of fans, which include some Native Americans. Supporters say that the name honors the achievements and virtues of Native Americans, and that it is not intended in a negative manner. Some, such as team president Bruce Allen, also point to the use of Redskins by three high school teams, two on reservations, that have a majority <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> students. Supporters have asserted that a majority of Native Americans are not offended by the name based upon a national poll by Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004. In a commentary published soon after that poll, 15 Native American scholars collaborated on a critique that stated that there were so many flaws in the Annenberg study that rather than being a measure <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> opinion, it was an expression of white privilege and colonialism. Specific criticism of the methodology includes the use of self-reporting to identify Native Americans, which violated the basic principles supporting the validity of public opinion polling. In May 2016, the Washington Post published a poll that duplicated the central question posed in 2004, yielding an identical result.|$|E

5|$|The Black Hawk War of 1832 {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} at least 70 settlers and soldiers, and hundreds of Black Hawk's band. As well as the combat casualties of the war, a relief force under General Winfield Scott suffered hundreds deserted and dead, many from cholera. The end of the war at Bad Axe ended the large-scale threat <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> attacks in northwest Illinois, and allowed further settlement of Illinois and what became Iowa and Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{lasted about}} two hours and Harrison lost 62 men (37 killed in action and 25 mortally wounded); about 126 were less seriously hurt. The Yellow Jackets {{suffered}} the highest casualties of the battle, with 30% of their numbers killed or wounded. The number <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> casualties is still the subject of debate, but it was certainly {{lower than that of}} the United States forces. Historians estimate that as many as 50 were killed and about 70–80 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Caudy {{participated in}} the French and Indian War and {{is best known for}} having purportedly defended himself from a band <b>of</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> fighters on Caudy's Castle—a {{sandstone}} outcrop that now bears his name. According to tradition, Caudy used his long rifle barrel to push his Native American attackers off the rock into the Cacapon River below. In his later life, Caudy became involved in a land dispute with John Capper that was resolved by Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron in November 1762. Caudy died in 1784 and was interred on his property south of present-day Capon Bridge. According to local tradition, Caudy was buried with a Native American on either side of him, while another tradition says Caudy was buried with his horse.|$|E
