5|$|Some species, {{notably the}} Australian {{paralysis}} tick, are also intrinsically venomous {{and can cause}} tick paralysis. Eggs can become infected with pathogens inside a female tick's ovaries, {{in which case the}} larval ticks are infectious immediately at hatching, before feeding on their first host. Tropical bont ticks transmit the rickettsial disease heartwater which can be particularly devastating in cattle. The ticks carried by migratory birds may act as reservoirs and vectors <b>of</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases.</b> Over twenty strains of pathogenic virus were found in the autumn in the Egyptian migratory bird study.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other factors are less closely linked to COPD. The risk is greater in those who are poor, {{although}} it is not clear if this is due to poverty itself or other risk factors associated with poverty, such as air pollution and malnutrition. There is tentative evidence that those with asthma and airway hyperreactivity are at increased risk of COPD. Birth factors such as low birth weight may also play a role as do a number <b>of</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases</b> including HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis. Respiratory infections such as pneumonia do not appear to increase the risk of COPD, at least in adults.|$|E

5|$|The {{previously}} described study by Timby et al. (2015) also assessed {{the effects of}} MFGM supplementation in term infants on the risk <b>of</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases</b> and other disease symptoms. In particular, the cumulative incidence of acute otitis media was analyzed between the two randomized feeding groups (control formula or MFGM- supplemented formula to 6 months of age), and compared to a breastfed reference group. The MFGM-supplemented group experienced {{a significant reduction in}} episodes of acute otitis media up to 6 months of age compared with infants fed control formula (1% vs 9%; P=0.034); with no significant difference in otitis media incidence compared to the breastfed group (0%). In addition, a significantly lower incidence and longitudinal prevalence of antipyretic drug use was seen in the MFGM-supplemented group (25%) compared with the control formula group (43%). Timby et al. (2017) further showed that the MFGM supplementation influenced the infants’ oral microbiota; the authors noted that, Moraxella catarrhalis, a common bacterial cause of acute otitis media, was less prevalent in infants fed the MFGM-supplemented formula than in those fed control formula.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{the central}} {{government}} revised the law on the control <b>of</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases</b> in March 2004. The revision provides instructions to tackle infectious-disease outbreaks, improve the reporting <b>of</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases,</b> implement interventions to control the spread of such diseases, provide clinical services, and fund the control <b>of</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>diseases.</b> This law directly benefited tuberculosis control by addressing the under-reporting of tuberculosis by health facilities. Tuberculosis now has to be reported to local public-health authorities within 24 hours. Because failure to report is now a crime, hospitals have begun to take the reporting of tuberculosis very seriously.|$|E

Reporting <b>of</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> by occupational and specialist physicians {{is an important}} tool {{in the investigation of}} occupationally related infections and is relevant in their management.

Methods Cases <b>of</b> <b>infectious</b> <b>disease</b> reported by occupational and specialist physicians to the UK based schemes, Occupational Disease Intelligence Network (ODIN) and The Health and Occupation Reporting network (THOR), from 2000 to 2003 were analysed by reporting patterns, diagnosis, single case or outbreak reporting and industry.
