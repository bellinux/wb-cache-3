50|$|If {{home and}} {{personal}} cleanliness contributes to reduced exposure to vital microbes, its role {{is likely to}} be small. The idea that homes can be made “sterile” through excessive cleanliness is implausible. The evidence shows that, as fast as they are removed by cleaning, microbes are replaced, via dust and air from outdoors, by shedding from the body and <b>other</b> living <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> from food. The key point may be that the microbial content of urban housing has altered, not because of home and personal hygiene habits, but because they are part of urban environments.

60|$|He answers, {{the people}} of these isles, and {{particularly}} the seers, are very temperate, and their diet is simple and moderate in quantity and quality; so that their brains are not, in all probability, disordered by undigested fumes of meat or drink. Both sexes are free from hysteric fits, convulsions, and several other distempers of that sort. There are no madmen among them, nor any instance of self-murder. It is observed among them, that a man drunk, never has {{a vision of the}} second-sight; and he that is a visionary would discover himself in <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as in that; nor are such as have the second-sight, judged to be visionaries by any of their friends or acquaintance.|$|E

Burning Daylight called up <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> They were there in the newspapers, the magazines, and the books on the Klondike. When all was said, Burning Daylight had a mighty connotation--one to touch any woman's imagination, as it touched hers, the gate between them, listening to the wistful and impassioned simplicity of his speech. Dede was after all a woman, with a woman's sex-vanity, and it was this vanity that was pleased by the fact that such a man turned in his need to her.|$|E
60|$|But {{there were}} <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> He put his {{confidence}} and his money into Parkinson, the renegade captain whom nobody would trust. And Parkinson sailed away on mysterious voyages {{in the little}} Vega. Parkinson was taken care of until he died, and years afterward Honolulu was astonished when the news leaked out that the Drake and Acorn guano islands had been sold to the British Phosphate Trust for three-quarters of a million. Then there were the fat, lush days of King Kalakaua, when Ah Chun paid three hundred thousand dollars for the opium licence. If he paid {{a third of a}} million for the drug monopoly, the investment was nevertheless a good one, for the dividends bought him the Kalalau Plantation, which, in turn, paid him thirty per cent for seventeen years and was ultimately sold by him for a million and a half.|$|E
50|$|When {{housing benefit}} {{does not fully}} cover rent people can {{struggle}} to pay rent and buy all the <b>other</b> <b>things</b> they need <b>as</b> <b>well.</b> This can lead to increasing debt. Anne Baxendale of Shelter, said, “We are deeply concerned that the current freeze on housing benefit is piling {{a huge amount of}} pressure on to thousands of private renters who are already teetering on the brink of homelessness.” People are forced out of their homes because they cannot pay their rent and all their other bills.|$|R
30|$|Economic {{remittances}} {{affect the}} hierarchy between the sender and the recipient. Hence, {{the correlations between}} receiving economic remittances and following voting recommendations cannot be reduced to mere clientelistic relationships; the reality is more complex. To be sure “Money matters in politics […] But <b>other</b> <b>things</b> matter <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> and the direct correlation between money and outcomes that so many political scientists have sought simply is not there” (Baumgartner, 2009, p. 291). More precisely, the statistical correlations between economic transfers and political influence signal complex interdependencies that cannot be conflated to {{presence or absence of}} clienteslistic patronage. Complex practices renegotiate, reshape, nuance, and rework the role of economic resources when it comes to political mobilization. Non-migrants have their own agency: in polling booths, they might ignore migrants’ recommendations and cast their ballot for another candidate. However, fieldwork showed that non-migrants are susceptible of aligning their political preferences on the ones of migrants, for a series of reasons.|$|R

60|$|It {{occurred}} to Bernard that--by some mysterious impulse--she was suddenly presenting {{him with a}} chance to ask her the question that Blanche Evers had just suggested. Two or three <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> {{occurred to}} him. Captain Lovelock had been struck with the fact that she favored Gordon Wright's addresses to her daughter, and Captain Lovelock had a grotesque theory that she had set her heart upon seeing this young lady come into six thousand a year. Miss Evers's devoted swain had never struck Bernard as a brilliant reasoner, but our friend suddenly found himself regarding him as one of the inspired. The form of depravity into which the New England conscience had lapsed on Mrs. Vivian's part was an undue appreciation of a possible son-in-law's income! In this illuminating discovery everything else became clear. Mrs. Vivian disliked her humble servant because he had not thirty thousand dollars a year, and because at a moment when it was Angela's prime duty to concentrate her thoughts upon Gordon Wright's great advantages, a clever young man of paltry fortune was a superfluous diversion.|$|E
60|$|But {{how about}} the juice, the sap, the qualities of the soil, the manure required? is the incredulous cry of Other People. What {{is the use of}} the roots, and {{especially}} of the rootlets, if they are not the mouths and supply-tubes of the plants? Well, I plainly perceive I can get 'no forrarder,' like the farmer with his claret, till I've answered that question, provisionally at least; so I will say here at once, without further ado--the plant requires drink as well as food, and the roots are the mouths that supply it with water. They also suck up a few <b>other</b> <b>things</b> <b>as</b> <b>well,</b> which are necessary indeed, but far from forming the bulk of the nutriment. Many plants, however, don't need any roots at all, while none can get on without leaves as mouths and stomachs. That is to say, no true plantlike plants, for some parasitic plants are practically, to all intents and purposes, animals. To put it briefly, every plant has one set of aerial mouths to suck in carbon, and many plants have another set of subterranean mouths as well, to suck up water and mineral constituents.|$|E
60|$|Then there {{started a}} revulsion from Gudrun. She {{finished}} life off so thoroughly, she made things so ugly and so final.

There he was, summed up, paid for, settled, done with. And it was such a lie. This finality of Gudrun's, this dispatching of people and things in a sentence, it was all such a lie. Ursula began to revolt from her sister.|$|R

Her Ladyship is treated with the same respect {{as the head of}} the Vietnamese household. Responsiveness is also seen as a feminine trait in Vietnam.
