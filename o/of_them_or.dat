5|$|Being {{the capital}} and largest city of the Republic of Macedonia, Skopje enjoys a {{particular}} status granted by law. The last revision of its status was made in 2004. Since then, the City of Skopje has been divided into 10 municipalities which all have a council and a mayor, like all the municipalities of the Republic of Macedonia. Municipalities only deal with matters specific of their territory, and the City of Skopje deals with matters that concern all <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>or</b> that cannot be divided between two or more municipalities.|$|E

5|$|For {{the battle}} {{sequence}} in North Africa, two actual Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks in Desert Air Force paint schemes were used, accompanied by cloned images <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> by computer-generated planes. In scenes showing squadrons of soldiers, digital extras were not used; instead, photography of real squadrons was cloned. Sony Pictures Imageworks also digitally expanded details on stage locations and at practical locations. The exterior of Hitler's Bavarian residence Berghof was digitally created, since little {{was left of}} the original structure, and the creation was superimposed on a shot of a ski area in Austria. In Berlin itself, city officials helped reduce the need for visual effects by removing power poles and modern lighting over the weekend when filming took place and restoring the equipment by the start of the new week.|$|E

5|$|Players can use {{a variety}} of weapons to fight enemies. The game {{features}} a large arsenal of weapons, from two-handed pistols to rocket launchers, and a variety of sea, land and air vehicles. Players can drive them, jump on top <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> hide in front of them while they are moving and hijack enemy vehicles, triggering a series of quick-time events. Initially, the player must acquire weapons and vehicles in the field. Early in the game, they encounter a black market supplier from whom weapons and vehicles can be purchased (with optional delivery to the player's location by helicopter). As more chaos points are gained, additional weapons, vehicles and an extraction option become available on the black market. All black-market weapons and vehicles can be upgraded in steps with weapon and vehicle components in the game world; over 2,000 parts may be acquired. Players use a beacon to access the market.|$|E

25|$|The story unfolds as a first-person {{narrative}} and contains many references (see below) to real people, places, literary works and philosophical and cultural concepts, besides some fictional or ambiguous ones which {{contribute to the}} plot development. It is divided into part one, part two, and a postscript. Events and facts are revealed roughly in the order that the narrator becomes aware <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> their relevance. The timing of events in Borges's first-person story is approximately from 1935 to 1947; the plot concerns events going {{back as far as}} the early 17th century and culminating in a postscript set in 1947.|$|E

Some languages have respect forms for {{the man and woman}} pronouns. Some languages have other pronouns as well (such as for trees.) (These pronouns show some etymological affinity to nouns for 'man', 'woman', 'tree', etc., but they are distinct from those nouns.) These may be pluralized (in some varieties, if one wishes to be explicit) by using the common plural marker de in front <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>or</b> by using explicit plural forms that have evolved.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} way, Stewart centers {{the first half}} of Earth Abides on the forces of natural and {{artificial}} selection. In freeing the landscape from humans, half of the book is devoted to looking at how the world would change in their absence. Stewart chose to make his main human character an ecologist, and sends him on a cross-country tour, to see what the world is like without people. As animals and plants no longer have humans taking care <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> controlling them, they are free to breed uncontrolled and to prey upon one another. The main character sees that some have been under humans so long that they are helpless in the face of change, while others are still able to adapt and survive. Stewart shows that humans have routinely influenced the lives of almost every plant and animal around them.|$|E
25|$|Pirates {{were mostly}} former {{merchant}} seamen, {{or at least}} men who had sailed on vessels legitimately before turning to piracy. As a result, a pirate ship still had the usual terminology found on merchant ships, but the role each ranking sailor would play on the pirate ship was not the norm. A pirate ship still had a Captain of the vessel. As the economist Peter Leeson argues, pirate captains were democratically elected by the entire crew. This was not a lifelong title and had less power than the merchant captain, as Leeson provides evidence of pirate captains being removed from the position, in one case thirteen captains were removed during one voyage, for not performing at the level that was expected <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> for overstepping their bounds of authority. The Pirate captain had absolute command when pursuing a vessel or in military engagements, otherwise he was {{another member of the}} crew.|$|E

25|$|The {{election}} on November 5, 1968, {{proved to be}} extremely close, {{and it was not}} until the following morning that the television news networks were able to declare Nixon the winner. The key states proved to be California, Ohio, and Illinois, all of which Nixon won by three percentage points or less. Had Humphrey carried all three of these states, he would have won the election. Had he carried only two <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> just California alone, George Wallace would have succeeded in his aim of preventing an electoral college majority for any candidate, and the decision would have been given to the House of Representatives, at the time controlled by the Democratic Party. Nixon won the popular vote with a plurality of 512,000 votes, or a victory margin of about one percentage point. In the electoral college Nixon's victory was larger, as he carried 32 states with 301 electoral votes, compared to Humphrey's 13 states and 191 electoral votes and Wallace's five states and 46 electoral votes.|$|E

500|$|Hurricanes late in {{the year}} are often in the process of {{undergoing}} extratropical transition and receiving baroclinic enhancement. Bermuda is less likely to be impacted during years when the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and southeastern United States are favored targets. Even in intense hurricanes, the islands tend to fare relatively well; ever since a cyclone in 1712 destroyed many wooden buildings, most structures have been built with stone walls and roofs, and are able to withstand severe winds. As a result, hurricane-related deaths have been uncommon since the early 18th century. Ten storms have collectively caused 129 fatalities; 110 <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>or</b> 85%, were the result of shipwrecks along the shore in Hurricane [...] "Ten" [...] of 1926. Hurricane Fabian in 2003 was the only system in the weather satellite era to cause storm-related deaths.|$|E
500|$|There is no {{recorded}} unrest {{against the}} queen accompanying her ascendance in ancient sources hostile to her, indicating no serious {{opposition to the}} new regime. The most obvious candidates for opposition were the Roman provincial governors, but the sources do not say that Zenobia marched on any <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>or</b> that they tried to remove her from the throne. According to Hartmann, the governors and military leaders of the eastern provinces apparently acknowledged and supported Vaballathus as the successor of Odaenathus. During Zenobia's early regency, [...] she focused on safegarding the borders with Persia and pacifying the Tanukhids in Hauran. To protect the Persian borders, the queen fortified many settlements on the Euphrates (including the citadels of Halabiye—later called Zenobia—and Zalabiye). Circumstantial evidence exists for confrontations with the Sassanid Persians; probably in 269, Vaballathus assumed the victory title of Persicus Maximus (the great victor in Persia); this may be connected to an unrecorded battle against a Persian army trying to control northern Mesopotamia.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton {{used his}} {{considerable}} fund-raising skills, and the expedition was financed largely by private donations, although the British government gave £10,000 (about £680,000 in 2008 terms). Scottish jute magnate Sir James Caird gave £24,000, Midlands industrialist Frank Dudley Docker gave £10,000 and tobacco heiress Janet Stancomb-Wills gave an undisclosed but reportedly [...] "generous" [...] sum. Public {{interest in the}} expedition was considerable; Shackleton received more than 5,000 applications to join it. His interviewing and selection methods sometimes seemed eccentric; believing that character and temperament were as important as technical ability, he asked unconventional questions. Thus physicist Reginald James {{was asked if he}} could sing; others were accepted on sight because Shackleton liked the look <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>or</b> after the briefest of interrogations. Shackleton also loosened some traditional hierarchies, expecting all men, including the scientists, to take their share of ship's chores. He ultimately selected a crew of 56, twenty-eight on each ship.|$|E
