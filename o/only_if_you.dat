It was later announced that the Saturdays had signed a contract for their show to be shown through, E! and their programme would be titled Chasing the Saturdays. The series was available on E! and later available on MTV. The series was 10 episodes long and was first broadcast on 10 January. The iTunes download included an extra-minute snippet of the show back in London and was <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> bought the entire series through iTunes.|$|E
25|$|Income {{taxation}} has {{the worst}} effect on {{division of labor}} {{in the form of}} barter. Suppose that the person doing job B is actually interested in having job A done for him. Now suppose you could amazingly do job A four times over, selling half your work on the market for cash just to pay your tax bill. The other half of the work you do for somebody who does job B twice over but he has to sell off half to pay his tax bill. You're left with one unit of job B, but <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were 400% as productive doing job A! In this case of 50% tax on barter income, anything less than 400% productivity will cause the division of labor to fail.|$|E

25|$|Version 5.5 {{followed}} in July 2000. First released to developers at the 2000 Professional Developers Conference in Orlando, Florida, then {{made available for}} download, version 5.5 focused on improved print preview capabilities, CSS and HTML standards support, and developer APIs; this version was bundled with Windows Me. Version 5.5 also includes support for 128-bit encryption. Although {{it is no longer}} available for download from Microsoft directly it can also be installed with MSN Explorer 6.0 as msnsetup_full.exe. The full version of MSN Explorer can be downloaded <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> use Windows 95, Windows NT 4.0, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE and Windows 2000 if Internet Explorer 5.5 has not yet been installed. The full version will work on also Windows ME and Windows XP but you will need to download it on Windows 2000 or earlier and transfer the setup file to the newer operating system. If you still want to download it on a newer operating system the only way is to use an outdated web browser such as Netscape 4.8.|$|E

500|$|The Dreamcast version's control {{responsiveness}} {{was praised}} by Gantayat. Guilty Gear Xs PS2 version was also generally praised, with Greg Kasavin of GameSpot writing that it [...] "controls smoothly and precisely". Major Mike of GamePro included the caveat that [...] "some moves {{are difficult to}} execute and require patience to master fully." [...] According to James Fudge for GameSpy, [...] "The gameplay manages {{to be easy to}} pick up but isn't dumbed down enough to annoy expert fight fans." [...] Guilty Gear Xs limited replay value was heavily criticised; Jay Fitzloff of Game Informer said, [...] "Since it's especially weak in the singles game, consider purchasing Guilty Gear X <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> and a friend want to go at it." ...|$|E

500|$|Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, {{in their}} book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five. The two praised Amman's ability to [...] "elicit {{real-world}} reactions out of fantastical situations". However, Shearman and Pearson took issue with the way Doggett's backstory was extrapolated. They noted that Doggett had been portrayed, {{up to the point}} in the series, as a [...] "solid and reliable" [...] character. However, [...] "Invocation" [...] sees him [...] " [...] protocol and [...] like a bully" [...] because of a case reminiscent of that of his deceased son's, a situation that, the two reason, is too similar to Mulder's own search for the truth about his sister, Samantha. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris bluntly wrote, [...] "'Invocation' is a masterpiece, but <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> grade it on a 'Roadrunners' bell-curve." [...] She elaborated, calling it [...] "a run-of-the-mill stand-alone, a combination of 'Revelations' and 'The Calusari'" ...|$|E
500|$|Political philosopher Kristján Kristjánsson differentiates {{threats and}} offers by {{explaining}} that the former is a proposal that creates an obstacle, while the latter is one kind of proposal (another example being a request) that does not. He also draws a distinction between tentative proposals and final proposals, which he feels earlier authors ignored. A tentative proposal does not logically create any kind of obstacle for its subject, and, as such, is an offer. For instance, [...] "if you fetch the paper for me, you'll get candy" [...] is a tentative proposal, as it does not logically entail that a failure to fetch the paper will result in no candy; {{it is possible that}} candy can be acquired by another route. In other words, if the subject fetches the paper, then they get candy. By contrast, if the proposal was a final proposal, it would take the form of [...] "if and <b>only</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> fetch the paper for me, you'll get candy". This entails that candy can only be acquired if the subject fetches the paper, and no other way. For Kristjánsson, this kind of final proposal constitutes a throffer. There is an offer to fetch the paper ("if"), and a threat that candy can only be acquired through this route ("only if"). As such, an obstacle has been placed on the route of acquiring candy.|$|E
