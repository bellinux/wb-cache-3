A similar characterization is obtained for the set of edges in T with smallest distance-edge difference in terms of the vertices <b>of</b> <b>smallest</b> distance balance. This yields a new proof that the set of vertices in T <b>of</b> <b>smallest</b> distance balance consists of a single vertex or two adjacent vertices (possibly disjoint from the center and the branch weight centroid) ...|$|R

40|$|Diaconis and Shahshahani {{studied a}} Markov chain W[function <b>of</b> (italic <b>small</b> f) ](1) whose states are the {{elements}} of the symmetric group S[function <b>of</b> (italic <b>small</b> f) ]. In W[function <b>of</b> (italic <b>small</b> f) ](1), you move from a permutation [pi] to any permutation of the form [pi](i, j) with equal probability. In this paper we study a deformation W[function <b>of</b> (italic <b>small</b> f) ]([alpha]) <b>of</b> this Markov chain which is obtained by applying the Metropolis algorithm to W[function <b>of</b> (italic <b>small</b> f) ](1). The stable distribution of W[function <b>of</b> (italic <b>small</b> f) ]([alpha]) is [alpha][function <b>of</b> (italic <b>small</b> f) ]-c([pi]) where c([pi]) denotes the number of cycles of [pi]. Our main result is that the eigenvectors of the transition matrix of W[function <b>of</b> (italic <b>small</b> f) ]([alpha]) are the Jack symmetric functions.
