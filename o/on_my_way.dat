I wanted to be a writer <b>on</b> <b>my</b> <b>way</b> to being a director. Directors were already my heroes. Kurosawa, number of Italian directors... Movies from England, France, Sweden, Italy. Poland... One wanted a chance to tell stories in an open, loose, not constricted Hollywood kind of way. At the same time you wanted to work in Hollywood... I was tremendously interested in genre films. Wanted to work within genre films.|$|E

500|$|Since late 2008, MOBA {{has been}} experimenting with {{allowing}} the public to title and caption some works. According to the curatorial staff, since some of the works are so puzzling, mere artistic interpretation is not sufficient: they must be [...] "interpreted". The [...] "Guest Interpretator's Collection" [...] is an invitation for MOBA's visitors to include their thoughts on compelling artworks; a contest decides the best analysis and one is added every two months. A professor at Boston University offered his thoughts: [...] "The location of the museum as much as its collection suggests {{a commitment to the}} abject and a belief in the power and force of culture's marginalized effects.

[...] British band Friendly Fires covered the song during BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Kevin O'Donnell of Spin praised their cover writing: [...] "Gaga's original showcases the pop star's gale force pipes, and Friendly Fires frontman Ed Macfarlane doesn't try to match that energy. Instead, they offer a lovely, cinematic take on the song: Macfarlane croons with the heart-on-sleeve sensitivity of an emo-boy over cascading synth melodies and a breezy funk pulse. Nice!" ...|$|E
500|$|Welling {{was cast}} in the WB superhero drama Smallville after a {{nationwide}} search for an actor to play Clark Kent.

[...] The pilot aired in October 2001 and became the highest rated debut for The WB, with 8.4 million viewers. Welling told TV Guide that he turned down the lead role twice, but after reading the script, decided to take the job.

In fact, he said, he continues to not read Superman comics: [...] "I made a conscious decision to stay away from that material. We're doing something different at a time before all that, I don't want that to affect what I'm doing, even subconsciously." [...] He did get the chance to meet two previous Superman actors: Christopher Reeve, who appeared in season 2: episode 17 titled [...] "Rosetta", and Dean Cain, who appeared in season 7: episode 4 titled [...] "Cure".|$|E
