5000|$|LCoS-based WSS, however, permit {{dynamic control}} of channel centre {{frequency}} and bandwidth through on-the-fly {{modification of the}} pixel arrays via embedded software. The degree of control of channel parameters can be very fine-grained, with independent control of the centre frequency and either upper- or lower-band-edge of a channel with better than 1 GHz resolution possible. This is advantageous from a manufacturability perspective, with different channel plans {{being able to be}} created from a single platform and even different operating bands (such as C and L) being able to use an identical switch matrix. Additionally, it is possible {{to take advantage of this}} ability to reconfigure channels while the device is <b>operating.</b> <b>Products</b> have been introduced allowing switching between 50 GHz channels and 100 GHz channels, or a mix of channels, without introducing any errors or [...] "hits" [...] to the existing traffic. More recently, this has been extended to support the whole concept of Flexible or Elastic networks under ITU G.654.2 through products such as Finisar's Flexgrid™ WSS.|$|E

However, in the early 1990 's low power microelectronics rapidly evolved from a substantial tributary to the mainstream of microelectronics. The principal reasons for this transformation were the increasing packing density of transistors and increasing clock frequencies of CMOS microchips pushing heat removal and power distribution to the forefront of the problems confronting the advance of microelectronics.
