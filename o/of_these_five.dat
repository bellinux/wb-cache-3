5|$|Altogether, {{thirteen}} {{teams have}} played {{in the past ten}} seasons of the IPL tournament. <b>Of</b> <b>these,</b> <b>five</b> teams are no longer a part of the tournament. In 2011, BCCI terminated the franchise of Kochi Tuskers Kerala for contractual breach. Similarly, BCCI terminated the franchise of Deccan Chargers in 2012 for backing off from its commitments. In 2013, Pune Warriors India exited IPL after it had a franchise valuation disagreement with BCCI. Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were suspended in 2015 following a betting controversy. Currently, the tournament features eight teams, including Delhi Daredevils, Gujarat Lions, Kings XI Punjab, Kolkata Knight Riders, Mumbai Indians, Rising Pune Supergiant, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Sunrisers Hyderabad.|$|E

5|$|Grand Canyon {{lies on the}} {{southern}} end of the Intermountain West seismic belt. At least 35 earthquakes larger than 3.0 on the Richter Scale occurred in the Grand Canyon region in the 20th century. <b>Of</b> <b>these,</b> <b>five</b> registered over 5.0 on the Richter Scale and the largest was a 6.2 quake that occurred in January 1906. Major roughly north—south trending faults that cross the canyon are (from west to east), the Grand Wash, Hurricane and Toroweap. Major northeast-trending fracture systems of normal faults that intersect the canyon include the West Kaibab and Bright Angel while northwest-trending systems include the Grandview—Phantom. Most earthquakes in the region occur in a narrow northwest-trending band between the Mesa Butte and West Kaibab fracture systems. These events are probably the result of eastward-migrating crustal stretching that may eventually move past the Grand Canyon area.|$|E
5|$|Mauna Kea {{is one of}} five hotspot volcanoes {{that form}} the island of Hawaii, the largest and {{youngest}} island of the Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain. <b>Of</b> <b>these</b> <b>five</b> volcanoes, Mauna Kea is the fourth oldest and fourth most active. It began as a preshield volcano driven by the Hawaii hotspot around one million years ago, and became exceptionally active during its shield stage until 500,000 years ago. Mauna Kea entered its quieter post-shield stage 250,000 to 200,000years ago, and is currently dormant. Mauna Kea does not have a visible summit caldera, but contains a number of small cinder and pumice cones near its summit. A former summit caldera may have been filled and buried by later summit eruption deposits.|$|E
5|$|These forty-seven cruisers all saw action {{across the}} globe in World War I; the bulk served with the German fleets in the North and Baltic Seas, though several served on foreign stations, {{typically}} as commerce raiders. Sixteen cruisers were lost during the war to causes ranging from enemy submarines and naval mines to combat with hostile cruiser squadrons. Most of the survivors were either scuttled in Scapa Flow in June 1919 or seized by the various Allied governments as war prizes following Germany's defeat. Several of these were commissioned into their fleets: Italy received three cruisers and France took four. Germany was permitted to retain eight of the oldest cruisers; <b>of</b> <b>these,</b> <b>five</b> continued to serve in secondary roles into World War II.|$|E

5|$|This season had a {{quick start}} but a slow end. Overall {{activity}} was below average, with twelve named systems in total. <b>Of</b> <b>these,</b> <b>five</b> were tropical storms, seven were hurricanes, of which three were major (Category 3 or {{higher on the}} Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale). Just one storm formed in August, {{one of the least}} active Augusts ever in the east Pacific. The season officially started May 15, 1973, in the eastern Pacific, and June 1, 1973, in the central Pacific, and lasted until November 30, 1973. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. All tropical cyclones this season formed in the eastern north Pacific Ocean, often off the coast of Mexico. As is usual in the northern hemisphere, most traveled generally westward or northwestward, and two reached as far as the waters south of the Hawaiian Islands.|$|E
5|$|Tournaments {{generally}} run for 10 consecutive episodes {{and feature}} 15 contestants. The first five episodes, the quarter-finals, feature three new contestants each day. The winners <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>five</b> games, {{and the four}} highest scoring non-winners ("wild cards"), advance to the semi-finals, which run for three days. The winners of these three games advance {{to play in a}} two-game final match, in which the scores from both games are combined to determine the overall standings. This format has been used since the first Tournament of Champions in 1985 and was devised by Trebek himself.|$|E
5|$|Uranus is {{the seventh}} {{planet of the}} Solar System; it has 27 known moons, {{all of which are}} named after {{characters}} from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. Uranus's moons are divided into three groups: thirteen inner moons, five major moons, and nine irregular moons. The inner moons are small dark bodies that share common properties and origins with Uranus's rings. The five major moons are massive enough to have reached hydrostatic equilibrium, and four of them show signs of internally driven processes such as canyon formation and volcanism on their surfaces. The largest <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>five,</b> Titania, is 1,578km in diameter and the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System, and about one-twentieth the mass of the Moon. The orbits of the regular moons are nearly coplanar with Uranus's equator, which is tilted 97.77° to its orbit. Uranus's irregular moons have elliptical and strongly inclined (mostly retrograde) orbits at large distances from the planet.|$|E
