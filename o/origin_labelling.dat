2500|$|Country {{of origin}} (COO), {{is the country}} of manufacture, production, or growth where an article or product comes from. [...] There are differing rules of origin under various {{national}} laws and international treaties. Country of <b>origin</b> <b>labelling</b> {{is also known as}} place-based branding, the made-in image or the [...] "nationality bias." [...] In some regions or industries, country of <b>origin</b> <b>labelling</b> may adopt unique local terms such as terroir used to describe wine appellations based on the specific region where grapes are grown and wine manufactured.|$|E

50|$|In Australia, such is {{the demand}} for the fish that a {{substantial}} amount of barramundi consumed there is actually imported. This has placed economic pressure on Australian producers, both fishers and farmers, whose costs are greater due to remoteness of many of the farming and fishing sites, as well as stringent environmental and food safety standards placed on them by government.

5000|$|Tampa Bay Times food {{critic and}} investigative {{reporter}} Laura Reiley {{found that many}} vendors at local [...] "farmers' markets" [...] were actually selling rejected produce from local wholesale markets, or selling produce purchased from non-local sources. In some cases they claimed to sell products from their own farm at first, but when pressed admitted that they had grown none of the products for sale. In at least one case despite vendor claims to the contrary the farm in question was not growing any food, and the produce was all purchased from other companies.

40|$|Bernard, John C. In an {{environment}} of increasingly health conscious consumers, {{how they feel about}} the quality and safety of foods from different regions could have significant impact on their impressions of, and willingness to pay (WTP) for, <b>origin</b> <b>labeled</b> products leading to more government involvement in creating <b>origin</b> <b>labeling</b> programs. This study aimed to determine if regional labels on chocolate bars: 1) influenced consumers' taste perceptions, and 2) changed their WTP. In order to complete these objectives both a taste evaluation and BDM auction mechanism were employed in five field experiment sessions conducted at different locations in Delaware. Results showed a higher perceived food safety, food quality, and economic status for Europe and the U. S. over South America and Africa. When comparing labeled versions, participants preferred the taste of, and were willing to pay more for, chocolate from more-developed (Europe and the U. S.) over the less-developed regions. However, in comparing labeled and unlabeled versions of the same chocolate, it was found that <b>origin</b> <b>labels</b> did not hinder taste evaluations or WTP, and instead typically resulted in premiums. This was counter to initial hypotheses and suggests implementing voluntary or mandatory <b>origin</b> <b>label</b> can raise product evaluations and increase sales. Taste evaluation and WTP bid difference models were conducted in order to identify variables that {{had a significant impact on}} the premium <b>origin</b> <b>labeled</b> products obtained over unlabeled products. Even though significant variables varied widely by model, there were a few that had an impact on both taste evaluation and WTP differences including income, children, post graduate education, and consumer importance placed on quality.

40|$|The final {{implementation}} of Mandatory Country-of-Origin Labeling has caused some U.

It was found that the implementation of Mandatory Country of <b>Origin</b> <b>Labeling</b> reduced the trade of live hogs between the United States and Canada by 37. 8 percent.

Country of <b>origin</b> <b>labelling</b> has implications for traceability systems in agrifood supply chains. The ability to provide consumers with information on the country of origin requires a basic level of traceability, although does not necessarily imply full traceability throughout the supply chain to the farm. This paper examines the role of traceability and identity preservation systems in marketing agri{{food products}}, focusing on the underlying economic functions of traceability systems. Voluntary versus mandatory labelling of country of origin and/or traceability becomes a question of determining if consumers value this information and whether a market failure exists in providing this information.

40|$|A {{provision}} of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 requires country of <b>origin</b> <b>labeling</b> (COOL) for certain agricultural commodities. To comply with the law, producers, processors, and retailers face additional production costs associated with labeling, separating, and tracking commodities. Using estimated costs provided by the U. S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), we simulate the impacts of mandatory COOL on U. S. and global agricultural markets using a global static general equilibrium model (STAGEM). The results show resource adjustments that lead to decreases in production, consumption, and trade flows.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{geographical}} <b>origin</b> <b>labels</b> on consumers' preferences. Specifically, we consider the preferences of Canadian consumers for extra virgin olive oils marketed with country-of-origin labels (COOL) and geographical indications (GIs). In contrast to previous studies, by considering a third-country market (a market different from that where production occurs), we can look simultaneously at COOL and GIs and separate the impacts of these two forms of geographical <b>origin</b> <b>labels.</b> We find that, {{within the context of}} a high quality value-added commodity such as extra virgin olive oil, consumers value both COOL and GI labels. But, in terms of the fraction of consumers with positive preferences and willingness to pay, COOL labels are valued more by Canadian consumers compared to GI labels. To better account for taste heterogeneity among consumers, we partition the sample on the basis of consumers' choice of shopping location. We find that different consumer groups vary to a large degree in their relative valuations for COOL, GI, and organic olive oils. country of <b>origin</b> <b>labeling,</b> extra-virgin olive oil, geographical indications of origin, mixed logit, PDO/PGI, stated-choice experiments, Consumer/Household Economics, Demand and Price Analysis,...|$|R
40|$|Country of <b>Origin</b> <b>Labelling</b> (COOL) {{regulation}} {{has been}} applied in the United States meat sector since October 2008. The industry must label beef, lamb and pork (ground meat and muscle cuts) sold through retail outlets according to its country of origin. The labelling requirements create differentiation at the retail level and may impose additional costs on producers, processors and retailers in the U. S. and elsewhere. The purpose of this analysis is to investigate whether there has been structural change in U. S. import demand for Canadian hog/pork products. Given that COOL {{has been in place}} for a limited period of time, we implement statistical procedures that are robust to structural change occurring {{at the end of the}} sample. We find evidence that COOL has impacted U. S. /Canada slaughter hog trade flows. While Canadian feeder hog prices appear to have declined concurrently with the introduction of COOL, statistical hypothesis testing found little evidence of structural change for feeder hog trade flows that could be associated with COOL.
