5|$|It is {{one thing}} to say that a bird has a {{property}} right in its nest, or that a wolf has a property right in its den – specific bits of territory used exclusively by one animal family. But the habitat that animals need to survive extends far beyond such specific and exclusive bits of territory – animals <b>often</b> <b>need</b> to fly or roam over vast territories shared by many other animals. Protecting a bird’s nest is of little help if the nearby watering holes are polluted, or if tall buildings block its flight path. It’s not clear how ideas of property rights can help here.|$|E
5|$|Challenges for the {{localization}} teams include space limitation (due to {{data storage}} and/or on-screen space), achieving a natural dialogue flow despite multiple plot branches and script lines being stored out of order, and, when voiced footage is not re-recorded for lip movement, dealing with file length and lip-synch limitations. When {{the same team}} works on different games in a series such as Final Fantasy, they <b>often</b> <b>need</b> to adopt different writing styles depending on the setting of their games. Another point to consider is humorous elements that do not translate properly into English, and different cultural expectations about character interactions. The localization process depends on {{factors such as the}} development teams' wishes, as well as budget and schedule. Traditionally, translation usually started late in development or after the original Japanese release, but recent titles have been translated during initial development, making the translators appear more like additional planners or consultants and not just translators-this was the case for Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIV and Final Fantasy XV. A few titles, like The Bouncer, have actually been recorded in English first and then adapted to Japanese. The Last Remnant also adopted this approach, featuring motion-capture and dialogue synched to English rather than Japanese actors. This was done due to the company's wish to create a title for the international market.|$|E

25|$|Reactors used {{in nuclear}} marine {{propulsion}} (especially nuclear submarines) often cannot be run at continuous power {{around the clock}} {{in the same way}} that land-based power reactors are normally run, and in addition <b>often</b> <b>need</b> to have a very long core life without refueling. For this reason many designs use highly enriched uranium but incorporate burnable neutron poison in the fuel rods. This allows the reactor to be constructed with an excess of fissionable material, which is nevertheless made relatively safe early in the reactor's fuel burn-cycle by the presence of the neutron-absorbing material which is later replaced by normally produced long-lived neutron poisons (far longer-lived than xenon-135) which gradually accumulate over the fuel load's operating life.|$|E
25|$|Brunello {{is often}} {{compared}} with the Pinot noir wines of Burgundy with its smooth tannins and ripe, fruit driven character. The high acidity of the wine allows it to pair well with food, especially grilled meat and game. A large portion of Brunello sold in the United States is purchased in restaurants. The wine has become particularly popular in America with nearly 1 out of every 3 bottles of Brunello di Montalcino being sold in the US. Brunello di Montalcino {{are known for their}} ability to age with well made examples from exceptional vintages often showcasing development for several decades. Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan notes that most Brunellos <b>often</b> <b>need</b> at least 10 years before they shed their youthfulness and start to harmonize their flavors.|$|E
25|$|The Women’s House in Robe St is an {{open access}} centre {{offering}} {{a safe place for}} women in need. Staff offer general case management, of usually 13 weeks, and intensive case management with the Women’s Housing Complex Needs Program (WHCN), which is usually between six and 12 months. Staff members provide support and referrals for issues such as counselling, housing, drug and alcohol support and parenting. Women who use these programs <b>often</b> <b>need</b> support having experienced family violence. The Women’s House open access operates from Monday to Friday, 11:30am – 3.00pm, providing women with a lunch, shower and laundry facilities. There is a sleeping room available for women to take a rest during opening hours. Health and wellbeing activities are also organised, such as ceramics and yoga classes, provided by volunteers.|$|E

25|$|Some {{approaches}} {{go further}} and propose continuously-varying dimensions {{that are not}} grouped into spectra or categories; each individual simply has a profile of scores across different dimensions. DSM-5 planning committees are currently seeking to establish a research basis for a hybrid dimensional classification of personality disorders. However, the problem with entirely dimensional classifications is {{they are said to}} be of limited practical value in clinical practice where yes/no decisions <b>often</b> <b>need</b> to be made, for example whether a person requires treatment, and moreover the rest of medicine is firmly committed to categories, which are assumed to reflect discrete disease entities. While the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual has an emphasis on dimensionality and the context of mental problems, it has been structured largely as an adjunct to the categories of the DSM.|$|E
25|$|Until the {{building}} of Tilbury Docks {{on the opposite side}} of the river, between 1882 and 1886, Gravesend was the Thames' first port of entry. Thousands of emigrants, as well as large numbers of troops, embarked from here. Tilbury Docks have expanded considerably since with the closure of all the London Docks. The entrance to the Docks is somewhat awkward, situated as it is on the sharp bend of the river, and <b>often</b> <b>need</b> tugboat assistance, as do the larger ships moored at Tilbury landing stages. There have been many tug companies based at Gravesend: among them the Sun Company, the Alexandra Towing Company and, today, the Smith Howard Towing Company. East Indiamen traditionally stopped here at a point known as Long Reach to lighten their loads before sailing up the Thames to moorings at Blackwall.|$|E
25|$|Traditional depth-of-field {{formulas}} {{and tables}} assume equal circles of confusion for {{near and far}} objects. Some authors, such as Merklinger (1992), have suggested that distant objects <b>often</b> <b>need</b> to be much sharper to be clearly recognizable, whereas closer objects, being larger on the film, {{do not need to}} be so sharp. The loss of detail in distant objects may be particularly noticeable with extreme enlargements. Achieving this additional sharpness in distant objects usually requires focusing beyond the hyperfocal distance, sometimes almost at infinity. For example, if photographing a cityscape with a traffic bollard in the foreground, this approach, termed the object field method by Merklinger, would recommend focusing very close to infinity, and stopping down to make the bollard sharp enough. With this approach, foreground objects cannot always be made perfectly sharp, but the loss of sharpness in near objects may be acceptable if recognizability of distant objects is paramount.|$|E

25|$|Vouvrays {{are known}} for their {{longevity}} and aging potential, particularly if the vintage was favorable. Some wines, most notably the sweeter Moelleux styles, have the potential to age and develop in the bottle for several decades to a century. While modern producers are contributing to making examples more approachable to drink while young, some premium examples still made in the traditionally high acid style will <b>often</b> <b>need</b> 3 to 7 years of bottle age before the acidity tones down. Dry or Sec examples from favorable vintages can have the potential to age for 15–20 years or more but many are ready to drink within 4 or 5 years after vintage. Sparkling Vouvrays tend not to have the same aging potential as their still wine counterparts or vintage dated Champagne and are usually meant to be consumed within 3 years of vintage or, for non-vintage bottling, soon after purchase.|$|E
25|$|Wheelchairs are {{devices that}} can be {{manually}} propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and {{are designed to be}} a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy. Wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility-related activities of daily living which include feeding, toileting, dressing, grooming, and bathing. The devices come in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a joystick, sip-and-puff control, or other input devices. Often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom walking is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability. People with both sitting and walking disability <b>often</b> <b>need</b> to use a wheelchair or walker.|$|E
25|$|Economic {{historians have}} found that {{societies}} in the Northern Hemisphere experience higher standards of living, and that as latitude increases north or south from the equator, levels of real GDP per capita also increases. Climate is closely correlated with agricultural production since without ideal weather conditions, agriculture alone will not produce the surplus supply needed to build and maintain economies. Locations with hot tropical climates often suffer underdevelopment due to low fertility of soils, excessive plant respiration, ecological conditions favoring infectious diseases, and unreliable water supply. These factors can cause tropical zones to suffer a 30% to 50% decrease in productivity relative to temperate climate zones. Tropical infectious diseases that thrive in hot and moist equatorial climates cause thousands of deaths each year. They are also an economic drain on society due to high medical costs, and the unwillingness of foreign capital {{to invest in a}} sickly state. Because infectious diseases like malaria <b>often</b> <b>need</b> a warm ecology for growth, states in the mid to high latitudes are naturally protected from the devastating effects of disease.|$|E
