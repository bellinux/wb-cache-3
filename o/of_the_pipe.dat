5|$|The Dialogus de Scaccario or Dialogue {{concerning}} the Exchequer, written in about 1178, details {{the workings of}} the Exchequer and gives an early account of how the Pipe rolls were created. The Dialogue was written by Richard FitzNeal, the son of Nigel of Ely, who was Treasurer for both Henry I and Henry II of England. According to the Dialogue, the Pipe rolls were the responsibility of the clerk of the Treasurer, who was called the Clerk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> and later the clerk of the pells. FitzNeal wrote his work to explain {{the inner workings of the}} Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls and how they are used. The Dialogue also states that the Pipe rolls, along with Domesday Book and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for daily use by the Exchequer clerks.|$|E
5|$|The cycle repeats at a {{frequency}} relative to {{how long it}} takes a wave to travel to the first open hole and back twice (i.e. four times the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipe).</b> For example: when all the holes bar the very top one are open (i.e. the trill 'B' key is pressed), the note A4 (440 Hz) is produced. This represents a repeat of the cycle 440 times per second.|$|E
5|$|The Pipe rolls, {{sometimes}} called the Great rolls, or the Great Rolls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pipe,</b> are a collection of financial records maintained by the English Exchequer, or Treasury, and its successors. The earliest date from the 12th century, and the series extends, mostly complete, from then until 1833. They form the oldest continuous series of records concerning English governance kept by the English, British and United Kingdom governments, covering a span of about 700 years. The early medieval ones are especially useful for historical study, as they {{are some of the}} earliest financial records available from the Middle Ages. A similar set of records was developed for Normandy, which was ruled by the English kings from 1066 to 1205, but the Norman Pipe rolls have not survived in a continuous series like the English.|$|E

30|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{procedure}} {{to fit the}} bent metal inner pipe with respect to <b>the</b> outer <b>pipe</b> such that only <b>the</b> two ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> are in {{contact with each other}} by adjusting <b>the</b> flexural rigidity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>pipe</b> with slits as shown in Fig. 2 b. Thus, the friction between <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> can be reduced even if <b>the</b> inner <b>pipe</b> touches <b>the</b> outer <b>pipe</b> in areas other than <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipes.</b> An inner pipe with optimally adjusted slit intervals can minimize the twist angle.|$|R

5|$|The cathedral's {{pipe organ}} {{was built in}} 1955 by Orgelbau Kuhn AG of Männedorf, Switzerland, for the Reformed Evangelical Basel Münster Cathedral in Basel, Switzerland. The Swiss cathedral donated the organ, {{dismantled}} it in 2002, and all pipes but without the largest—Nr.65 principal bass32, 10m (32ft) long—were transferred to Moscow. The pipes were transported wrapped in new garments donated {{by the people of}} Basel, which were later distributed to Moscow's poor. The installation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> organ in Moscow was performed by the Orgelbau Schmid company from Kaufbeuren, Germany, headed by Gerhard Schmid, who refused payment for his work. During the work, Schmid was killed in a fall from a scaffold on 9September 2004; his son Gunnar finished the work.|$|E

Kesslee, whose body had been reconstructed by the cybernetic surgeon Che'tsai (James Hong), reveals that Tank Girl has unknowingly been bugged. Deetee is killed. While the Rippers turn the tide of the battle, Jet Girl kills Sergeant Small (Don Harvey), who had earlier sexually harassed her. Kesslee reveals that Sam is in the pipe, her life {{endangered}} by rising water. Tank Girl uses her tank to kill Kesslee, then pulls Sam out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipe.</b> The film ends with an animated sequence showing water starting to flow freely. Tank Girl drives down rapids, pulling Booga behind on water-skis, then takes them over a waterfall, shouting for joy.|$|E
5|$|Work {{carried out}} in the 20th and 21st centuries {{included}} full cleaning of the stonework and the reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> organ by Klais Orgelbau of Bonn. The stonework of the west front had been subject to natural erosion therefore a process of lime-based conservation was carried out during the 1990s by Nimbus Conservation under the guidance of Professor Robert Baker who had previously worked on the west front of Wells Cathedral. Some of the damage to sculptures had been made worse by the use of Portland cement by previous work {{carried out in}} the Victorian era. A statue of St Phillip was beyond repair and was removed and replaced with a modern statue by Laurence Tindall.|$|E

5|$|During the 12th {{century the}} Norman kings {{attempted}} to formalise the feudal governance system initially created after the invasion. After the invasion {{the king had}} enjoyed a combination of income from his own demesne lands, the Anglo-Saxon geld tax and fines. Successive kings found that they needed additional revenues, especially {{in order to pay}} for mercenary forces. One way of doing this was to exploit the feudal system, and kings adopted the French feudal aid model, a levy of money imposed on feudal subordinates when necessary; another method was to exploit the scutage system, in which feudal military service could be transmuted to a cash payment to the king. Taxation was also an option, although the old geld tax was increasingly ineffective due to a growing number of exemptions. Instead, a succession of kings created alternative land taxes, such as the tallage and carucage taxes. These were increasingly unpopular and, along with the feudal charges, were condemned and constrained in the Magna Carta of 1215. As part of the formalisation of the royal finances, HenryI created the Chancellor of the Exchequer, a post which would lead to the maintenance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pipe</b> rolls, a set of royal financial records of lasting significance to historians in tracking both royal finances and medieval prices.|$|E

25|$|Pipe piles can {{be driven}} either open end or closed end. When driven open end, soil {{is allowed to}} enter the bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> or tube.

Closed end pipe piles are constructed by covering the bottom of the pile with a steel plate or cast steel shoe.|$|E
25|$|The {{ventilated}} improved {{pit latrine}} (VIP) is a pit latrine {{with a black}} pipe (vent pipe) fitted to the pit and a screen (flyscreen) at the top outlet <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipe.</b> VIP latrines are an improvement to overcome the disadvantages of simple pit latrines, e.g. fly and mosquito nuisance and unpleasant odors. The smell is carried upwards by the chimney effect and flies are prevented from leaving the pit and spreading disease.|$|E
50|$|It {{had been}} {{thought that the}} {{material}} used to make <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> had been quarried from Ohio pipestone outcrops across the Scioto River from Tremper, but new tests have shown that <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> were made from Sterling pipestone from northwestern Illinois.

50|$|It {{is a kind}} of Scottish “Bagpiper” or Chinese “Snag”. Nine small Bamboo pipes or hollow reeds, Having {{different}} sizes and lengths are inserted to the dried gourd. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> serves as a mouth piece. Small portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipes</b> are struck out so that it can produce sound when the instrument is blown. The Musician blows into the mouth piece, and by controlling the holes with his fingers, he can produced various musical notes.|$|R
25|$|To be successful, a beaver dam pipe must {{eliminate}} {{the sound and}} feel of water flowing into the pipe. Successful pipe designs (e.g. Flexible Pond Leveler, Castor Master, Clemson Pond Leveler) achieve this by protecting the intake end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> with a cylindrical fence enclosure. A beaver swimming along {{the outside of the}} fence enclosure is unable to hear or feel the flow of water into the pipe and cannot reach it to block it.|$|E
25|$|Typically, elaborate, {{capital-intensive}} {{storm sewer}} networks are engineered {{to deal with}} stormwater. In some cities, such as the Victorian era London sewers or much of the old City of Toronto, the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.|$|E
25|$|The leather valve {{along the}} top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pipe</b> tended to dry out and air could then leak in, but this was mitigated {{slightly}} by the passing trains spraying water on the leather. The harsh environment of the line, which runs adjacent to the sea for much of its length and is often soaked with salt spray, presented difficulties in maintaining the leather flaps provided to seal the vacuum pipes, {{which had to be}} kept supple by being greased with tallow; even so, air leaked in, reducing the pressure difference.|$|E
