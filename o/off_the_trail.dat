5|$|St. Elmo is a 1910 American silent short drama {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The scenario was adapted by Lloyd Lonergan from Augusta Jane Evans's 1866 novel of the same name. Frank H. Crane and Anna Rosemond play the leading roles in the simplified plot that was reliant on inter-titles to tell the story. The film follows St. Elmo who is engaged to his cousin Agnes, being betrayed by his friend Dick Hammond who has an affair with Agnes. St. Elmo challenges and kills Hammond in a duel. A young girl, Edna witnesses the duel and leads Agnes and the sheriff <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> St. Elmo disappears and returns five years later to woo Edna. She rejects then accepts his affections only {{to stop him from}} committing suicide. The production was met with mixed reviews by critics, but was successful. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

The {{ecosystem}} of the waterfront makes it a perfect nesting place for small and large water birds including herons, egrets, geese, ducks and pelicans, along with woodland birds such as owls, hawks and eagles. Some feral bird species may also be identified, including parakeets that feed near the trees right <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{their first}} task as warriors, Fireheart and Graystripe are {{assigned}} to find WindClan, which had been driven out by ShadowClan, and bring them home. They go to the WindClan camp and search for clues there. On the way, they see some RiverClan warriors hunting on WindClan territory. Graystripe finds the correct scent trail, and they follow it to a makeshift WindClan camp. Fireheart spots Barley's farm a little ways <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> and the pair hurriedly leaves in fear of the dogs that live on the farm chasing them after they get let out.|$|E

The condo {{was in the middle}} of a gated complex, surrounded by other units from which burglars could have expected to be easily observed. The front door had an alarm warning, and had not been forced open, as it might have been if the putative burglars had not expected anyone to be at home.|$|E
25|$|Ochre River Trail is {{situated}} deep within Riding Mountain National Park, beginning just off Highway #10 and then winding {{its way through}} thick forest down to a parking lot on the north-eastern boundary of the park. Highlights along this trail include scenic campsites, river views, stream crossings, and a serene forest setting. The trail is used by backpackers, bikers, horseback riders, and cross country skiers. Skiers can make an over-night trek from the South Trailhead to Cairn’s Cabin (located about 800m <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> near the Ochre River Campsite) for the night and then back out again the following day. This cabin must be booked and paid for in advance. This trail has not been maintained since September 29, 2011.|$|E
25|$|From 1928 to 1932, the Hungarian {{research}} team of Albert Szent-Györgyi and Joseph L. Svirbely, {{as well as}} the American team led by Charles Glen King in Pittsburgh, first identified the anti-scorbutic factor. Szent-Györgyi had isolated the chemical hexuronic acid (actually, L-hexuronic acid, although he did not know the stereochemistry at that time) from animal adrenal glands at the Mayo clinic, and suspected it to be the antiscorbutic factor, but could not prove this without a biological assay. At the same time, for five years King's laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh had been trying to isolate the antiscorbutic factor in lemon juice using the original 1907 model of scorbutic guinea pigs which developed scurvy when not fed fresh foods, but were cured by lemon juice. They had also considered hexuronic acid as being the vitamin, but had been put <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> when a coworker made the explicit (and mistaken) experimental claim that this substance was not the antiscorbutic substance.|$|E

25|$|Nance {{began work}} on The Plot to Hack America incidentally, while already engaged in writing Hacking ISIS. During the course of {{research}} for Hacking ISIS, he discovered computer hacking to Germany's legislative body the Bundestag, and French television station TV5Monde. At the time, the hacks {{were thought to be}} caused by ISIS, and instead they were traced back to Russian hacking group, the Cyber Bears. Nance knew this was a Russian intelligence GRU operated group, and realized the attribution to ISIS was a false flag operation to throw investigators <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> This gave Nance prior knowledge of Russian intelligence tactics, through the Cyber Bears, to infiltrate servers for purposes of disrupting government in the case of Germany, and injecting propaganda in the case of France. After the 2016 hack on the DNC, it was apparent to Nance that the identical foreign agency had carried out the attack, GRU. Nance's suspicions were borne out as accurate when security firm CrowdStrike determined Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear were behind the attack. Nance saw this as akin to the Watergate scandal, albeit a virtual attack instead of a physical break-in to Democratic facilities.|$|E

500|$|The {{plot was}} adapted from Augusta Jane Evans's 1867 novel St. Elmo. The actual {{production}} was greatly shortened {{for the purposes of}} conveying the plot of the film. The synopsis in The Moving Picture World states: [...] "St. Elmo, a wealthy young man, is betrothed to his cousin Agnes. Dick Hammond, St. Elmo's chum, is studying for the ministry. As soon as he is ordained he is to take charge of a church built for him by St. Elmo. Hammond, however, takes St. Elmo's friendship lightly and makes love to Agnes in secret. The affair is discovered by St. Elmo, who, in a rage at Hammond's perfidy, challenges him to a duel. The false friend loses his life in the ensuing combat. Edna, the granddaughter of the village blacksmith, strays upon the scene of the duel, an uninvited witness. St. Elmo is forced to flee the country. He is pursued by Agnes and the sheriff. Edna tells her first lie when she deceives St. Elmo's pursuers as to his direction and leads them completely <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> St. Elmo makes good his escape. On the day that Edna witnesses the duel her grandfather dies, leaving her alone in the world. She is adopted by St. Elmo's mother. Five years later the fugitive returns. Edna recognizes him as the victor of the dual but he does not remember having met her. He discovers that he loves the girl. Edna rejects his suit, declaring that she never would marry a man who had taken a human life. In desperation, St. Elmo attempts suicide, choosing as a spot the grave of Dick Hammond, but is swerved from his purpose by Edna, who relents and promises him her love and sympathy. St. Elmo decides that life is worth living if but for her sake." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although {{nearly all}} of the delegates signed the constitution, very few delegates volunteered to join Brown's forces, {{although}} it will never be clear how many Canadian expatriates actually intended to join Brown because of a subsequent [...] "security leak" [...] that threw off plans for the raid, creating a hiatus in which Brown lost contact with many of the Canadian leaders. This crisis occurred when Hugh Forbes, Brown's mercenary, tried to expose the plans to Massachusetts Senator Henry Wilson and others. The Secret Six feared their names would be made public. Howe and Higginson wanted no delays in Brown's progress, while Parker, Stearns, Smith and Sanborn insisted on postponement. Stearns and Smith were the major sources of funds, and their words carried more weight. To throw Forbes <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> and to invalidate his assertions, Brown returned to Kansas in June, and he remained in that vicinity for six months. There he joined forces with James Montgomery, who was leading raids into Missouri.|$|E
2500|$|On a pretext, Poirot makes Japp {{call at the}} mews {{house and}} while they are there Poirot sneaks {{another look at the}} {{cupboard}} under the stairs and sees that the attaché-case has gone. As Miss Plenderleith has just come back from playing golf at Wentworth, they go there and find out that she was seen on the links with the case. Later investigations show that she was seen to throw the item into the lake there. The police retrieve it but find nothing in it. Poirot asks Japp and Miss Plenderleith to call at his flat and they tell her of Eustace's arrest. Poirot then tells her of his real conclusions. From clues concerning missing blotting paper, Poirot deduces that Mrs Allen had written a letter just before she died, which if she killed herself, would indicate a suicide note. [...] He postulates that Miss Plenderleith came home, found her friend dead, driven to kill herself by the actions of her blackmailer and was determined to avenge her – this wasn't a murder made to look like suicide but a suicide made to look like murder and thereby entrapping the blackmailer. Miss Plenderleith placed the gun in Mrs Allen's right hand, {{despite the fact that she}} was left-handed, and the purpose of her trip to Wentworth was to hide there the dead lady's golf clubs – left-handed clubs, the attaché-case being a red herring to put the police <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> [...] Convinced by Poirot that Major Eustace will be imprisoned for his other crimes, she agrees to tell the truth and save the man from the gallows.|$|E

2500|$|The {{plant and}} take off is {{initiated}} typically three steps out from the final step. Vaulters will usually count their steps backwards from their starting point to the box only counting the steps taken on the left foot (vice versa for left-handers) except for the second step from the box, which is taken by the right foot. For example; a vaulter on a [...] "ten count" [...] (referring {{to the number of}} counted steps from the starting point to the box) would count backwards from ten, only counting the steps taken with the left foot, until the last three steps taken and both feet are counted as three, two, one. These last three steps are normally quicker than the previous strides and are referred to as the [...] "turn-over". The goal of this phase is to efficiently translate the kinetic energy accumulated from the approach into potential energy stored by the elasticity of the pole, and to gain as much initial vertical height as possible by jumping off the ground. The plant starts with the vaulter raising their arms up from around the hips or mid-torso until they are fully outstretched above the head, with the right arm extended directly above the head and the left arm extended perpendicular to the pole (vice versa for left-handed vaulters). At the same time, the vaulter is dropping the pole tip into the box. On the final step, the vaulter jumps <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> leg which should always remain straight and then drives the front knee forward. As the pole slides {{into the back of the}} box the pole begins to bend and the vaulter continues up and forward, leaving the trail leg angled down and behind.|$|E
