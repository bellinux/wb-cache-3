50|$|Add-drop {{multiplexers}} (ADMs) are {{the most}} common type of network elements. Traditional ADMs were designed to support one of the network architectures, though new generation systems can often support several architectures, sometimes simultaneously. ADMs traditionally have a high-speed side (where the full line rate signal is supported), and a low-speed side, which can consist of electrical as well as <b>optical</b> <b>interfaces.</b> The low-speed <b>side</b> takes in low-speed signals, which are multiplexed by the network element and sent out from the high-speed side, or vice versa.|$|R
50|$|Optical module {{refers to}} a {{typically}} hot-pluggable optical transceiver used in high-bandwidth data communications applications. Optical modules typically have an electrical <b>interface</b> on the <b>side</b> that connects {{to the inside of}} the system and an <b>optical</b> <b>interface</b> on the <b>side</b> that connects to the outside world through a fiber optic cable. The form factor and electrical interface are often specified by an interested group using a multi-source agreement (MSA). Optical modules can either plug into a front panel socket or an on-board socket. Sometimes the optical module is replaced by an electrical interface module that implements either an active or passive electrical connection to the outside world. A large industry supports the manufacturing and use of optical modules.|$|R
50|$|Originally, both {{electrical}} and <b>optical</b> <b>interfaces</b> were defined by SMPTE, over concerns that an electrical interface at that bitrate would be expensive or unreliable, {{and that an}} <b>optical</b> <b>interface</b> would be necessary.

50|$|In many cases, the {{baud rate}} of the <b>optical</b> <b>interface</b> does not equal {{the baud rate}} of the {{electrical}} interface. In these cases, a gearbox is used within the module to convert between the two rates.

40|$|The local plane-interface {{approximation}} (LPIA) is {{a method}} for propagating electromagnetic fields through the inhomogeneous regions (e. g., elements) of an optical system. The LPIA is the superclass of all approximations that replace the usually curved <b>optical</b> <b>interfaces</b> with local tangential planes. Therefore the LPIA is restricted to smooth optical surfaces. A maximum radius of curvature of the <b>optical</b> <b>interface</b> {{of the order of}} a few wavelengths is a rough estimate for the validity of the LPIA. Two important approximation levels of the LPIA are the thin-element approximation (TEA) and a geometric. optical version of the LPIA (LPIAray). The latter combines the wave-optical propagation of an electromagnetic field in the homogeneous region of an optical system with a ray-tracing step in the inhomogeneous region. We discuss the regions of validity of the LPIA in general and the approximation levels LPIAray and TEA in detail...|$|R

40|$|In {{the digital}} X-ray imaging systems, {{one of the}} main {{problems}} to be solved is the efficiency of the <b>optical</b> <b>interfaces</b> between scintillators and photodetectors. This article presents the theoretical analysis, simulations, and experimental results on two different <b>optical</b> <b>interfaces</b> (SiO 2 and Si 3 N 4), in order to maximize the X-ray detection efficiency. The working principle is the following: the X-ray photons reach the scintillator, which produces visible light. The visible light is then absorbed by the CMOS photodetector. Due {{to the fact that the}} refractive indexes of the scintillator and the photodetector are different, the visible light produced by the scintillator is partially reflected by the surface of the photodetector. In order to minimize this problem it is necessary to cover the photodetector with an anti-reflective filter. The anti-reflective filters were fabricated using two different dielectric layers available in a standard CMOS process, with no increase of the production time and costs of the device...|$|R
