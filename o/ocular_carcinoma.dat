40|$|Isolates of bovine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (BHV- 1) {{are associated}} with a variety of clinical manifestations. To determine if a single form of BHV-I was responsible for the different virus-associated diseases or whether subpopulations of various isolates produced different clinical symptoms, studies were initiated to examine the DNA restriction enzyme patterns and nucleic acid homology between virus isolates from respiratory infections and other clinical syndromes. Differences between the genomes of several virus isolates were detected using DNA restriction enzyme analyses. However, nucleic acid hybridization studies of the virus DNAs using filter and liquid hybridization indicated at least a 95 ~ genetic homology between the virus isolates from different ypes of infections. Additionally, these studies demonstrated that the DNA of BHV- 1 had an average molecular weight of 84 x 106. Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV- 1) has been associated with a variety of clinical syndromes.

One thousand eight hundred thirty-six sebaceous carcinomas were diagnosed during the time period: 633 (34. 5 %) in the eyelid and 786 (42. 8 %) in the extraocular head and neck skin.

Here, we provide a clinicopathological correlation of <b>ocular</b> sebaceous <b>carcinoma</b> in a young individual lacking history of hereditary cancer or immunosuppression. Findings A detailed histopathological study including p 53 DNA sequencing was performed on an aggressive sebaceous carcinoma presenting in a healthy 32 year-old Caucasian woman. She had no history of retinoblastoma, evidence for a hereditary cancer syndrome, or radiation therapy. However, she potentially was at risk for excessive UV light exposure. A detailed {{review of the literature}} is also provided. A moderately well differentiated sebaceous carcinoma was established histopathologically arising from the meibomian gland of the upper eyelid. In most areas, the cytoplasm contained small but distinct Oil-red-O positive vacuoles. Direct sequencing of p 53 identified a G:C→A:T mutation at a dipyrimidine site. The mutation results in substitution of arginine for the highly conserved glycine at residue 199 located at the p 53 dimer-dimer interface.

OSCC has been diagnosed all over the world with high prevalence, being the most common bovine tumour and the one causing the most significant economic losses (Hamir & Parry, 1980; Dennis et al., 1985, Heeney & Valli, 1985; Wilcock, 1993). In Portugal, the frequency of these tumours is particularly high in the Azores, where in S. Miguel Island a large number of cattle affected with OSCC is rejected for consumption at slaughter. OSCC is the second most frequent neoplasia after urinary bladder tumours, representing 21 % of all cases of rejection due to neoplasia (Pinto et al, 1996). Several reasons have been advanced to explain this situation namely the fact that animals stay in pasture all year around, with a prolonged exposition to day light and benefiting from few shelters. The ingestion of toxic plants present the pasture could also give rise to photosensitazation problems, either primary or due to hepatic toxicity, that could generate predisposing conditions to the development of OSCC...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to immunocharacterize Bovine <b>Ocular</b> Squamous Cell <b>Carcinoma</b> {{neoplastic}} cells, in terms of proliferation index and DNA damage, using two human primary antibodies anti- Ki 67 antigen of the cell cycle and anti- p 53. Ki 67 is a nuclear antigen expressed in dividing cells during late G 1, G 2, S-phase and M-phase that disapears rapidly after mitosis. p 53 is a tumor supressor protein that plays a key role in the control of the DNA damage acting as a supressor of tumour cell proliferation, enhancing genetic stability. Mutation of the gene that codes for p 53 provides an extended intracellular half-life of the protein and greater stability, therefore increasing its expression. Tumours for this study were obtained at the slautherhouse, in Ponta Delgada, Azores. A total of thirty samples were colected from eighteen bovine. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed in parafin embeded sections of formalin fixed material, using the Avidin-Biotin-Peroxidase method (ABC). Primary antibodies used were anti-human p 53 (NCL – p 53 CM- 1, NOVOCASTRA, UK) and anti-human Ki 67 (NCL – Ki 67 p, NOVOCASTRA, UK), both policlonal. Positivity for both Ki 67 and p 53 was evaluated quantitatively and semi-quantitatively, respectively...|$|R
