5000|$|The trail closing has, as of December 2013, {{generated}} considerable political controversy.

We now report that the virus agglutinates red cells of primate origin, though with plasma-derived virus this activity is masked by the presence of an IgM-like inhibitor. This observation is consistent with the presence on the erythroid precursor target cell of a specific receptor for parvovirus B 19. Parvovirus B 19, the causative agent of erythema infectiosum and viral aplastic crisis, was first described by Cossart et al. in 1975.
