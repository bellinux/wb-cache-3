5|$|After the Philippines fell to Japanese {{forces in}} 1942, the Department <b>of</b> <b>Agriculture</b> <b>and</b> the U.S. Army urged farmers to grow hemp fiber and tax stamps for {{cultivation}} were issued to farmers. Without {{any change in}} the Marihuana Tax Act, over 400,000 acres of hemp were cultivated between 1942 and 1945. The last commercial hemp fields were planted in Wisconsin in 1957. New York Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, who was a strong opponent of the 1937 Marihuana Tax Act, started the LaGuardia Commission that in 1944 contradicted the earlier reports of addiction, madness, and overt sexuality.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, fuel {{stocks were}} used by the armies, and were {{unavailable}} to farmers. This allowed horses to remain a key aspect <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> <b>and</b> transportation {{until the end of}} the war. After the war, farmers rapidly mechanized their operations. The Auxois and other draft breeds were quickly abandoned in favor of machines, and population numbers began to fall in the early 1950s and collapsed completely in the 1960s. By the 1970s, the Auxois had almost disappeared, although many villages in the breed's homeland retained a small number of mares for traditional competitions.|$|E

A school of agriculture would teach about important topics such as crop rotation, the specific ways to work with each crop, methods of seeding and harvesting, preservation of seeds, and identification of pests. Until that time, the only previous attempts to teach agriculture was done by the Jesuits, who were banished in 1767.|$|E
