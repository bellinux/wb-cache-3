Darryl demands anew to be fired, then switches gears: he tells Andy {{to give him the}} manager job, saying he deserves it and wants that or a pink slip. Andy then steps up and bluntly tells Darryl he not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> not going to do that, but Darryl was not even the runner-up to Andy in the selection process. As he brings up Darryl's short temper, his hiring of the unqualified Glenn, and his loss of interest in taking business education courses, Darryl finally snaps out of his funk and listens to him. Andy tells Darryl that Jo Bennett loved him and saw something in him, and he simply stopped striving after that. He convinces Darryl to stay on board, and Darryl says he will assemble a new warehouse staff using a combination of his picks and one or two of Andy's applicants.|$|E

5|$|Boating on {{the canal}} is encouraged, {{although}} {{the lack of}} a link to the River Parrett at Bridgwater is restrictive.

Not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> there a risk of silt entering the canal, but the salt water cannot be allowed to contaminate the fresh, as the canal is still used for the transport of drinking water for the population of Bridgwater. The canal forms part of the local flood relief system, in winter taking water from the River Tone at Taunton and discharging it into the Parrett at a sluice in the western fringe of Bridgwater, near the Bridgwater Canalside Centre.|$|E
5|$|Dar was disqualified on 28 July 2017 by the Supreme Court of Pakistan to {{hold the}} office of Ministry of Finance after then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was also disqualified by the court {{following}} Panama Papers case decision. On the same day, he had ceased to hold ministerial office when the federal cabinet was disbanded after Nawaz Sharif resigned as Prime Minister. Following the election of Shahid Khaqan Abbasi as new Prime Minister in early August 2017, Dar {{was inducted into the}} federal cabinet of Abbasi despite his disqualification and an investigation was ordered against him by the Supreme Court and was re-appointed as the Minister for Finance for the fourth time After assuming the office of Prime Minister, Abbasi divided the Finance Ministry into separate entities thus minimizing the role of Dar in the federal government affairs. On 11 August 2017, he was removed as chairman of Economic Coordination Committee by Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi. On 20 August 2017, he was removed from the chairmanship of some 35 National Assembly committees by Shahid Khaqan Abbasi thus further reducing Dar's influence. Pakistan Today reported that the reason of confining Dar to Ministry of Finance <b>only</b> <b>is</b> on direction of the Sharif family.

Intent on rescuing M, Bond follows the clues to Vrakonisi, one of the Aegean Islands. In the process, Bond discovers the complex military-political plans of Colonel Sun of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Sun {{had been sent to}} {{sabotage}} a Middle East détente conference which the Soviet Union is hosting. He intends to attack the conference venue and use M and Bond's bodies to blame Great Britain for the disaster, leading to a world war. Bond meets Soviet agents in Athens and they realise that not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> a third country behind the kidnap, but that there is a traitor in the organisation. An attack on the Soviet headquarters kills all the agents except Ariadne Alexandrou, a Greek Communist. As he is dying, the Soviet leader encourages Bond and Ariadne to work together to prevent an international incident.|$|E

5|$|Lion's {{share of}} Ireland has with most likehood been {{above sea level}} during the last 60 million years. As such its landscapes have been shaped by erosion and {{weathering}} on land. Protracted erosion does also means most of the Paleogene and Neogene sediments have been eroded away or, as known in a few cases, buried by Quaternary deposits. Before the Quaternary glaciations affected Ireland the landscape had developed thick weathered regolith on the uplands and karst in the lowlands. There have been some controversy regarding {{the origin of the}} planation surfaces found on Ireland. While some have argued for an origin in marine planation others regard these surfaces as peneplains formed by weathering and fluvial erosion. Not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> their origin disputed but also their actual extent and the relative role of sea-level change and tectonics in their shaping. Most river systems in Ireland formed in the Cenozoic before the Quaternary glaciations. Rivers follow for most of their course structural features of the geology of Ireland. Marine erosion since the Miocene might have made Ireland's western coast retreat more than 100 km. Pre-Quaternary relief was more dramatic than today's glacier-smoothened landscapes.|$|E

5|$|Mount Rainier is {{currently}} {{listed as a}} Decade Volcano, {{or one of the}} 16 volcanoes with the greatest likelihood of causing great loss of life and property if eruptive activity resumes. If Mt. Rainier were to erupt as powerfully as Mount St. Helens did in its May18, 1980 eruption, the effect would be cumulatively greater, because of the far more massive amounts of glacial ice locked on the volcano compared to Mount St. Helens, the vastly more heavily populated areas surrounding Rainier, and the simple fact that Mt Rainier is a much bigger volcano, almost twice the size of St. Helens. Lahars from Rainier pose the most risk to life and property, as many communities lie atop older lahar deposits. According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), about 150,000 people live on top of old lahar deposits of Rainier. Not <b>only</b> <b>is</b> there much ice atop the volcano, the volcano is also slowly being weakened by hydrothermal activity. According to Geoff Clayton, a geologist with a Washington State Geology firm, RH2 Engineering, a repeat of the Osceola mudflow would destroy Enumclaw, Orting, Kent, Auburn, Puyallup, Sumner and all of Renton. Such a mudflow might also reach down the Duwamish estuary and destroy parts of downtown Seattle, and cause tsunamis in Puget Sound and Lake Washington. Rainier is also capable of producing pyroclastic flows and expelling lava.|$|E

At least two governors of New York lived in buildings facing Washington Park outside of their term in office. Due to the historical and architectural significance of the park and neighborhood both were included in 1972 as the Washington Park Historic District; and in 1998 the park was named one of the nation's 100 most important parks by the American Association of Architects. In 2008 Boston-based composer Peter Child wrote an orchestral piece inspired by the park, entitled Washington Park.|$|E
