In the 18th century, Benjamin Franklin conducted extensive research in electricity, selling his possessions to fund his work.

A succession <b>of</b> <b>sparks</b> jumping from the key {{to the back of his}} hand showed that lightning was indeed electrical in nature. He also explained the apparently paradoxical behavior of the Leyden jar as a device for storing large amounts of electrical charge in terms of electricity consisting of both positive and negative charges.|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. <b>Spark</b> ignition <b>of</b> the air-fuel mixture at the appropriate time is important for successful flame initiation and complete combustion thereafter without unnecessary emissions. The physical and chemical reactions taking place between the spark plug electrodes during spark delivery determine the intensity <b>of</b> the <b>spark</b> and subsequent flame initiation. The energy <b>of</b> <b>spark</b> and the duration of its delivery are dependent on the ignition system design. The characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>spark</b> plug determine the interaction <b>of</b> the <b>spark</b> with the air-fuel mixture. The compression pressure, combustion chamber temperature and mixture motion at the time <b>of</b> <b>spark</b> generation {{play a significant role in}} the flame initiation process. All of these parameters are responsible for the resulting spark discharge and flame initiation process. The objectives of this research include investigation of the different phases <b>of</b> <b>spark</b> discharge and development of a thermodynamic analysis to determine the rate of change <b>of</b> the <b>spark</b> kernel temperature with time during the initial phases <b>of</b> the <b>spark</b> discharge. The effect <b>of</b> <b>spark</b> energy delivery rate, heat transfer losses and mass entrainment on the spark kernel temperature was determined through the thermodynamic analysis. This research also includes an evaluation of the various types of conventional as well as high-energy ignition systems for lean burn engines. An experimental ignition system was constructed to determine the effect <b>of</b> ignition energy, <b>spark</b> plug electrode geometry and gas pressure on {{the character}}istics <b>of</b> the <b>spark</b> discharge. Images <b>of</b> <b>spark</b> discharge were captured through photography using three different types of electrode geometries and also by varying the pressure and by changing the ignition energy using different condensers in the ignition system.

5|$|Across the Way is a 1915 American silent {{short film}} {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company under the Princess brand. The comedy-drama involves a man named Sparks playing a trick on his friend to make him question his sanity. The trick involves the friend's love interest being attacked by an assailant which works, but then a burglar attacks her a few days later. The friend saves his love interest from the burglar and later marries him instead <b>of</b> <b>Sparks.</b> The Princess comedy-dramas were not well-received {{and it was not}} long after the film's release that Edwin Thanhouser took a personal interest in the productions at the New Rochelle studio. Soon thereafter, the Princess brand was discontinued and replaced by the Falstaff brand. The film is presumed to be lost.|$|E
5|$|Although Project Alberta had no attack orders, it {{proceeded}} {{with the plan}} to have the Little Boy ready by 1 August 1945 and the first Fat Man ready for use {{as soon as possible}} after that. In the meantime, a series of twelve combat missions were flown between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan using high-explosive Pumpkin bombs. Project Alberta's Sheldon Dike and Milo Bolstead flew on some of these missions, as did the British observer Group Captain Leonard Cheshire. One serious incident occurred when a Pumpkin bomb was released in the bomb bay of the B-29 Strange Cargo while it was taxiing. The bomb fell through the closed bomb bay doors onto the taxiway. The plane came to a halt in a shower <b>of</b> <b>sparks,</b> but fire fighters doused the plane and the bomb in foam, and the bomb did not explode. The aircraft had to be jacked up to remove the bomb.|$|E
5|$|The climatic vault heist {{required}} {{four weeks}} of preparation with every scene and camera angle determined in advance. The filmmakers hired stunt director Spiro Razatos and stunt coordinator Jack Gill to direct the second-unit action filming. The pair initially began research for the stunt by testing {{the capabilities of the}} prop vaults and the Dodge Chargers driven by Diesel and Walker. Filmed on the streets of Hato Rey, the chaotic scene demanded specific timing that had to be synchronized with the various character interactions also occurring during the scene. Razatos chose to use a series of camera cars including a crane-mounted camera atop a Porsche Cayenne, which allowed him to film from a variety of angles and heights while the vehicles were in motion, and a Subaru Impreza with a steel cage built around it that allowed for tracking shots. The Subaru's driver Allen Padelford would occasionally accidentally collide with the vault, creating a shower <b>of</b> <b>sparks</b> that inadvertently became useful footage. Padelford also developed a top-mount dual-drive system for the Chargers that allowed a stunt driver to control the vehicle from the roof, while the actor focused on their performance inside the car.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} Spears at a vanity, putting Curious on and {{earrings}} by Bulgari. She is then seen holding a top hat {{in front of}} her face, while doves fly out of another hat. Spears starts singing in the vanity but stands up and puts on a ringmaster jacket. She walks through an aisle while dancing suggestively with several circus dancers. Throughout the video, there are interspersed scenes of different circus performers, including ribbon dancers, contortionists, clowns and a mime on stilts. There are also scenes of Spears singing with the top hat, wearing a nude body stocking in front of a red curtain, with a spotlight on her. This is followed by a group dance scene {{in the middle of a}} circus ring, where Spears wears the ringmaster jacket, sequined hot pants and a feathered top hat. In the second verse, she dances with a chair and a whip wearing a nude bra covered in leaves. The video continues with a series of intercut scenes, such as Spears in slow motion in front of a shower <b>of</b> <b>sparks,</b> her surrounded by a pair of lions and in front of an elephant. During the bridge, Spears and her dancers perform a routine in front of flames. In the last chorus, Spears returns to the circus ring, surrounded by two elephants, many more circus performers, dancers and fire breathers. The video ends with Spears in the spotlight, laughing with the top hat over her head.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a closeup shot of Katy's face, {{surrounded}} by alternating red and blue lights, as she mouths the song's lyrics. It then changes to a mechanics' shop, where two young men are seen sitting, looking to the ground. Shots <b>of</b> <b>sparks</b> then appear in the screen, which emerge from a car. Katy {{is sitting on the}} automobile's passenger seat, while looking to her love interest, who is repairing the car, seemingly worried. She is later seen being driven by her boyfriend's group in that car. Her boyfriend is seen lying on a bed, and looking at the mirror, looking distantly. The car seen before finally arrives in a car parking lot where other cars are driving in circles. They exit their cars while others start driving again. The video's final scenes take place at the car parking lot, while the cars keep driving, with shots of women and other men sitting on the cars. The visual finally closes with a similar shot to that seen in the beginning, of Katy's face surrounded by lights, though now, her face is mixed with her love interest's.|$|E

However, it is found that, at loads with reduced trapped residuals, the presence <b>of</b> <b>spark</b> influences combustion. Therefore the effects <b>of</b> <b>spark</b> timing on the CAI combustion process were investigated through the introduction <b>of</b> <b>spark.</b> The effect on engine performance and the emission specific values were evaluated. The engine speed was maintained at 1500 r/min and lambda was kept constant at 1. 2.

25|$|Almost any finely-divided organic {{substance}} becomes an explosive material when dispersed as an air suspension; hence, {{a very fine}} flour is dangerously explosive in air suspension. This poses a significant risk when milling grain to produce flour, so mills {{go to great lengths}} to remove sources <b>of</b> <b>sparks.</b> These measures include carefully sifting the grain before it is milled or ground to remove stones which could strike sparks from the millstones, and the use of magnets to remove metallic debris able to strike sparks.|$|E
25|$|The Benz Patent-Motorwagon and the Ford Model T used a {{trembler}} {{coil ignition}} system. A trembler coil was a battery-powered induction coil; the trembler interrupted the current through the coil and caused a quick series <b>of</b> <b>sparks</b> during each firing. The trembler coil would be energized at an appropriate {{point in the}} engine cycle. In the Model T, the four-cylinder engine had a trembler coil for each cylinder; a commutator (timer case) delivered power to the trembler coils. The Model T would be started on battery but then switched to an alternator.|$|E

25|$|The {{first step}} in the {{emergence}} of life may have been chemical reactions that produced many of the simpler organic compounds, including nucleobases and amino acids, that are the building blocks of life. An experiment in 1953 by Stanley Miller and Harold Urey showed that such molecules could form in an atmosphere of water, methane, ammonia and hydrogen with the aid <b>of</b> <b>sparks</b> to mimic the effect of lightning. Although atmospheric composition was probably different from that used by Miller and Urey, later experiments with more realistic compositions also managed to synthesize organic molecules. Computer simulations show that extraterrestrial organic molecules could have formed in the protoplanetary disk before the formation of the Earth.|$|E
