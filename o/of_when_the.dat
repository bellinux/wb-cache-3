5|$|Homer becomes {{depressed}} {{after learning}} {{he has lived}} past the halfway point of the average life expectancy for men without accomplishing anything worthwhile. His family tries to cheer him up by showing him a film of his accomplishments and a special appearance by the character KITT from the Knight Rider television series that Homer is a fan <b>of.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> film projector stops working, Lisa mentions that Thomas Edison invented the projector and many other inventions. Homer decides {{to learn more about}} Edison and eventually idolizes him. In an attempt to follow his footsteps, he quits his job at the power plant to become an inventor.|$|E
5|$|The Dry Salvages is {{the third}} poem of T. S. Eliot's Four Quartets and marks the {{beginning}} <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> series was consciously being formed {{as a set of}} four poems. It was written and published in 1941 during the air-raids on Great Britain, an event that threatened him while giving lectures in the area. The title comes from the name of a rock formation near a town he spent time at as a child, which reflects Eliot's references to his own past throughout the poem.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} list {{contains a}} chronology <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> various sections of mainline railway lines were electrified. The list excludes industrial and short branch lines, {{as well as}} systems installed at ports and yards. The list contains the date when the electrification was taken into regular use on each section. It also notes if a section was opened as an electric railway, and if the line was prepared as an electric line, but where this was not taken into use immediately. The list contains the line and section to be electrified, and its length. The length indicates {{the length of the}} mainline section at the time of electrification. Due to changes of routes and shortening of lines, the current length of sections may be shorter. The sixth column shows the electrification system, including voltage and frequency in case of AC and no frequency in case of DC.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} {{election}} since the Act on a Candidate's Election Funding came into force in May 2009, along with the 2010 amendments to the Act on Political Parties. Both laws mandate the disclosure {{of the sources of}} campaign finance and expenses. Every candidate and party as a whole must disclose their source of funding. Campaign funding may start six months before the election day and end two weeks after the election regardless <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> costs are actually paid. The candidates must file a public report with the National Audit Office detailing their sources of all contributions of over €1,500 in value raised in support of the election campaign. The funds include expenses from the candidate's own assets, loans taken out for the campaign, and contributions received by either the individual or by a group that supports the candidate. Candidates are barred from receiving anonymous contributions of over €1,500 in value.|$|E
5|$|Although a court roll of 1389 {{mentions}} two gardens, {{there is}} no record of where these were sited, nor is there any record <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> terraces were constructed. The basic layout as known today was certainly in place by about 1730, {{as can be seen in}} a portrait of the house from that period. Later in the 18th century, the space behind the great pilastered wall was infilled to make the top terrace, which has wide views across the valley to the Mendip Hills beyond. The Octagon, a garden pavilion, was built about the same time, as was the more rustic summer house which faces it down the long grassy walk of the Pretty Terrace. Further modifications involved facing the lower retaining wall with rosy pink bricks, which were also used to build a double flight of steps below the Octagon. The garden is still largely in its 18th-century form, though small ponds and fountains were added in the 19th century and the once open hillside behind is now thickly wooded. A single rose arbour remained from the Edwardian garden but was on the verge of collapse when it was replaced with a new one in 2009, marking 300 years of the Elton family's presence at Clevedon Court.|$|E

5|$|Sky Team (Místico, Valiente and Volador Jr.) are {{the current}} champions, having {{defeated}} Los Guerreros Laguneros (Euforia, Niebla Roja and Último Guerrero) {{to win the}} title on February 13, 2015. They are the 27th overall championship team and this is their first reign as a team. Místico and Valiente have previously held the championship with Máscara Dorada. 25 different teams have held the title, combining for 27 individual title reigns. Only two teams have held the title more than once, the first champions Los Infernales and the team of Héctor Garza, Hijo del Fantasma and La Máscara. Black Warrior, Blue Panther and Dr. Wagner Jr. hold {{the record for the}} longest single reign of any team, but due to the uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> championship was vacated it can only be verified that they held them for a minimum of 1,141 days. Dr. Wagner Jr.'s four reigns combine to 2,051 days, the highest of any wrestler. Héctor Garza's five individual reigns is the record for the most reigns of any individual wrestler. All title matches take place under two out of three falls rules.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{continued}} to prosper through the 1920s and 1930s with a toll of one quarter {{to cross the}} bridge, with drivers of State Highway Route 6 coming along the bridge from the junction with State Highway Route 8 coming across the bridge since 1927. During the 1920s and 1930s, the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania began to buy out bridges along the Delaware River under the Joint Commission for the Elimination of Toll Bridges. The reconstructed bridge at Belvidere was bought by the commission for $60,000 (1920s USD) and the covered bridge at Columbia for only $50,000. Although the commission tried to buy the second-hand railroad bridge for a lower, unspecified amount, Darlington used his strong bargaining skills to raise the amount to $275,000, {{a far cry from}} the other local bridges. Residents of Knowlton Township, New Jersey rejoiced at the fact <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> bridge was bought, tolls were eliminated from the crossing. The new generation of people prospered at the thought that the crossing the Delaware would be forever free.|$|E

25|$|According to Rabbi Jose b. Hanina, {{each of the}} Patriarchs instituted one prayer: Abraham the morning, Isaac the {{afternoon}} and Jacob the evening prayers. This view is supported with Biblical quotes indicating that the Patriarchs prayed at the times mentioned.

25|$|Retreat mining is {{a method}} in which the pillars or coal ribs used {{to hold up the}} mine roof are extracted; {{allowing}} the mine roof to collapse as the mining works back towards the entrance. This {{is one of the most}} dangerous forms of mining, owing to imperfect predictability <b>of</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> roof will collapse and possibly crush or trap workers in the mine.|$|E

25|$|During the 1970s ATV, the {{previous}} Midlands licence holder, had often been criticised for {{its lack of}} regional output and character.
