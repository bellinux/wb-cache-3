It proposes a theoretical framework designed to conceptualise aspects of meaning-making across on- and offline contexts. In arguing for the ‘(im) materiality’ of literacy, it makes four propositions which highlight the complex and diverse relationships between the immaterial and material associated with meaning-making. Complementing existing sociocultural perspectives on literacy, the article {{draws attention to the}} significance of relationships between space, mediation, materiality and embodiment to literacy practices. This in turn emphasises the importance of the subjective in understanding how different locations, experiences and so forth inflect literacy practice. The article concludes by drawing on the Deleuzian concept of the ‘baroque’ to suggest that this focus on articulations between the material and immaterial helps us to see literacy as multiply and flexibly situated...|$|E

40|$|This study {{explores the}} online higher {{education}} experience {{of students who}} are enrolled on a traditional face-to-face undergraduate degree program. The core focus of the research was to investigate the Virtual learning Environment experience of students who study in Higher Education. Data was collected from 117 students who were enrolled on undergraduate degrees in the United Kingdom. The research is based on individual student questionnaires. Early findings indicate that student’s want an experience that is consistent with their classroom-based teaching. In many cases students perceived that the offline experience was disconnected from the online experience and came across as having been designed in a ad-hoc manner with little or no thought put in to the development process. This negative online experience was contaminating the experience of the course as a whole and indicated that students were viewing the <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> <b>experience</b> as one holistic entity. To better understand the student perception in how Virtual Learning Environments are used and developed learner perceptions and academic course design will be discussed and the use of social media as a bridge between the offline and online environments will be explored...|$|E
40|$|The exceptionality of #occupymovement {{give rise}} to a {{collective}} subjectivity and shared social unrest. This social event generated an innovative speech and the reappropriation of public space. It became a body capable of making visible emotions that are inside each of us. Because the body exists also in the virtual space, participants in the #occupymovement used social networks to mobilize people. Physical bodies (demonstrating at Zuccotti Park), voices (ideas, posters, banners, tweets, meetings) and emotions (invisible but real) constitute this new mixture that can be understood as machines, technologies which fuse with the bodies. Most bodies in the square, while shouting, approve, argue, and write banners, as well tweets, texts messages on social networks, shared images. Real space and virtual space intersect within this mix, enriching the linguistic and expressive chaos of social unrest in different places. Ordinary objects for common people, like plastic chairs clobbered with mobile phones, give voice to thousands of bodies in a system that usually suppresses these voices. A camping-like place such as the one in the picture becomes an offline world, while Internet mobile phones, in an online world, are capable of fighting against formal institutions. The ability of putting the body in the language is a feature of the mutant-figure, a body that has won the man with lungs, thanks to a set of voices, emotions and new technologies.

The Glass museum has aimed at creating an iPod application that should enrich the experience in the physical location of the museum by means of using their recently digitized collection. During the pilot of the iPod application TNO carried out research {{in order to find}} out to what extent and how the digitized collection could be used to allow visitors to explore a wide range of content in their visit to the museum. The pilot resulted in some valuable insights that were used in optimising the iPod application to a redesign.

Because the application could be tested in the physical location of the museum, it was possible to identify what was of most value to the visitors of the museum in an early stage of the development. Introducing the mobile application in the museum as a way to use a digital collection of data is only the first step towards a different museum experience...|$|E
40|$|How {{identity}} is communicated in forum-based Virtual Communities of Consumption (VCCs) {{and the role}} of the medium in identity communication are investigated by comparing what occurs online and face-to-face, using a conceptual framework of Symbolic Interactionism and Medium Theory. Ten qualitative case studies are applied, where one individual's <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> <b>experience</b> represents a case. Principal data gathering techniques in the two environments (online and omine) were observations and semi-structured interviews. Data were analysed using socio-semiotics and grounded theory. The findings reveal that reading identity online is a much richer and complex process than conveying identity. Reading identity online is involves medium, social and individual factors. The medium acts both as enabler constraint in identity communication with both similarities and differences, in comparing the process online with what occurs face-to-face. The research makes a literature contribution to identity communication online with a critique of Symbolic Interactionism, suggesting Sensemaking as a finer framework. It also contributes to an understanding of VCCs as places of consumption with a typology of the threads present in VCCs and the type of social interaction occurring in them; with different focuses of attention when interacting online influencing online relationships; it also offers some qualitative insights into how social {{identity is}} communicated. Knowledge of VCCs as objects of consumption in their own right is also enriched regarding the multidimensional and ontologically fluid nature of VCCs as a 'virtual product'. Further insights are offered into distinctivity about the intemet environment in relation to identity communication. An adapted version of Kress and van Leeuwen's socio-semiotic framework and the added data capturing accuracy through Virtual Network Computing can benefit future research, with the multilayered, comparative approach applied in other settings. Managerial recommendations include suggestions on organising and managing the community more effectively considering the role of the individual in shaping the community experience, the different worth and uses of online identity symbols/cues, the importance of members' accountability online to develop relationships, and impact of thread topic and structure on social interaction.

Learning processes take place in this complex environment, and they include formal and informal experiences (learning in school, home, and real-virtual communities), peer cultures and intergenerational connections, production and creation as relevant activities, and personal interests as a focal point. Methods used in the study of learning and the social practices of young people must take into account four key issues: boundaries between <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> <b>experiences</b> are blurring; young people act performatively; young people act knowingly or reflexively; and the activities of young people cannot be understood {{through the use of a}} single method but require the use of multiple tools of investigation.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} {{the role of}} the Internet and of the (techno) social networks in the circulation of political-electoral information and in the processes of influencing political opinion during the Campaign for the 2006 general elections in Italy. The basic hypothesis is that online information, which can strengthen, integrate, replace the information produced by traditional media, reaches some Internet users who then become sources of information for people who don’t use this medium and for other Internet users characterized by a more generic and recreational use of the medium (through the same Internet and computer mediated communication systems -chat, email, forum, instant messaging, blog, etc.). On a theoretical level, this work is rooted in the path undertaken by the recent communication research: careful about the unnumbered everyday possibilities of integration between <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> <b>experiences,</b> this recent research considers Internet as mature technology of social relation, as well as powerful database of information. This contemporary communication research rethinks the conceptual and methodological instruments developed in order to study “offline” realities, by verifying their descriptive and interpretative potential with the mediated sociality. In fact, our research finds some conceptual and methodological suggestions {{in the tradition of the}} studies on personal influence and social networks in the circulation of political-electoral information (Lazarsfeld, Berelson, Gaudet, 1948, Katz, Lazarsfeld, 1955). This suggestions are the points of departure of other questions about the actuality of the two-step flow model of communication (developed in a very simple communication setting, characterized by a limited and privileged diffusion of the media) and about the mechanism of circulation of political-electoral information through Internet supported and immediate social networks...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWhile {{customers}} increasingly expect seamless, integrated, {{consistent and}} personalized experiences across channels (Rigby, 2011; Schramm-Klein et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2010), the current multi-channel and traditional business model of retailers, with its multiple silos, is unadapted {{to these new}} expectations. Retailers need to move towards an integrated approach of their channels and, ultimately, to go omni-channel (Rigby, 2011; Strang, 2013). This is an important challenge from their perspective (Brynjolfsson et al., 2013). Such a strategy arouses great interest among retail managers despite facing key issues regarding their core business model when going omni-channel (Brown et al., 2013). Numerous research have been devoted to multi-channel strategies, both from the customer and the retailer perspectives (Aubrey and Judge, 2012; Avery et al., 2012; Griffiths and Howard, 2008; Gulati and Garino, 2000). They suggest that <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> <b>experiences</b> can be complementary (e. g. Rigby, 2011 : p. 72). Yet in focusing on the multi-channel approach, research may be overlooking the new omni-channel approach that provides a frame for a single, unified experience for the customer across all channels. Thus, important issues in relation to omni-channel retailing strategy remain unaddressed in the literature and prompt this research. Following calls to investigate how to analyze, formulate and implement an omni-channel strategy (Brynjolfsson et al., 2013; Gallino and Moreno, 2013; Lewis et al., 2013; Strang, 2013), this article examines how a multi-channel retailer goes omni-channel. It does so by developing a qualitative study on how an online retailer Direct Optic combines bricks and clicks. More precisely, {{the objective of this}} research consists in investigating in– depth the motives, challenges and processes of orchestrating the convergence of bricks with clicks in an omni-channel perspective...|$|R

The current study aims to investigate whether adolescents' <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> risk <b>experiences</b> are driven by the same general propensity to risks. Data from a representative study of N = 19, 406 (50 % girls) internet-using 11 – 16 year olds (M = 13. 54, SD = 1. 68) youth in Europe were subjected to the current analyses.

A bi-factor model of a general risk factor and two specific factors of <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> risks was shown to provide the best theoretical and empirical fit. All risk experiences loaded significantly on the general risk factor while additionally all offline risks loaded significantly on the offline risk factor. However, none of the online risks loaded significantly on the online risk factor. Online risks could not be explained by factors that go beyond a general propensity to experience risks suggesting that new technologies do not bring with them a new type of risk propensity driven by that environment. Interventions should target risk and protective factors that can account for adolescents’ experiences across risk types (<b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline)</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This paper {{explores the}} {{experiences}} and interconnection of young people’s <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> (face-to-face) <b>experiences</b> of interpersonal violence and abuse (IPVA) victimization across 5 European countries (i. e., Bulgaria, Cyprus, England, Italy and Norway) and its subjective impact. Evidence on the association between <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> forms of IPVA in young people’s relationships remains rare and even fewer studies address the subjective impact of these experiences. To our knowledge {{this is the first}} study to address these issues within a European context. Method: As part of a wider mixed-method study, a school-based survey was completed with 4, 564 young people aged 14 – 17 across 5 European countries. Results: The findings showed that IPVA through new technologies, especially controlling behavior and surveillance, represented a common aspect of IPVA behaviors across the 5 country samples. There was a substantial intersection between <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> forms of IPVA. In 3 of the 5 country samples, IPVA prevalence rates were not significantly associated with gender. However, for each form of IPVA studied, the reported subjective impact was gendered: Girls reported greater negative impact than boys. Conclusion: Our research showed that youth programs aimed at preventing or responding to adolescent IPVA need to pay careful attention to how new technologies are used within young people’s relationships {{and the ways in which}} these experiences may be differentiated by gender...|$|R
40|$|Peer {{groups such}} as neighbourhoods and hobby circles are {{important}} sources of social identity for young people, but their viability is challenged by processes of urbanisation and labour mobility. In recent years, traditional peer groups have been joined by easily accessible computer-mediated groups, which have become an everyday part of life in many countries. In this article, we examine how young people identify with various <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> peer groups. We compare <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> identification <b>experiences</b> {{from the perspective of}} how socio-demographic position and individual sociability characteristics influence them, and examine how these identification processes differ between national contexts. Empirical analyses are conducted based on a survey of online community users from the UK, Spain and Japan (N! 4299). It is found that participants identify as strongly with their online communities as they do with their own families, and stronger than with offline hobby groups. In the mature online societies of the UK <b>and</b> Japan, the <b>online</b> group provides a more socio-demographically inclusive source of identification than traditional leisure-time formations. As friends <b>and</b> family move <b>online,</b> affinity towards online groups {{is more likely to be}} a reflection of high sociability than a lack of it.

40|$|Abstract Background: This article explores {{changes in}} the {{prevalence}} of youth Internet users reporting unwanted sexual solicitations between 2000 and 2005, {{as well as the}} risk factors related to reports of the most serious solicitations, aggressive solicitations, in which solicitors attempted or made offline contact with youth. Methods: Data were collected from two cross-sectional random-digit-dial telephone surveys of Internet-using youth (aged 10 to 17) in the United States. Results: Although sexual solicitations declined overall since 2000, in 2005 youth were 1. 7 times more likely to report aggressive solicitations, even when adjusting for changes in demographic and Internet-use characteristics. Risk factors for aggressive solicitations included being female, using chat rooms, using the Internet with a cell phone, talking with people met online, sending personal information to people met online, talking about sex <b>online,</b> <b>and</b> <b>experiencing</b> <b>offline</b> physical or sexual abuse. Conclusions: Further research is warranted into the implications of aggressive <b>online</b> sexual solicitation <b>and</b> how to address and prevent such experiences...|$|R
40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} study {{aimed to explore}} the association between the intensity of participation in <b>online</b> depression communities <b>and</b> the benefits users gain from participation. The study {{was based on an}} online survey of 631 users in 16 English language-based online depression communities. Results indicated that there were several differences between heavy, medium and light users with regard to their participation patterns, but they did not differ in their background characteristics and hardly varied in their interests. There were also no differences between the groups in their level of depression. However, there were many significant differences in perceived benefits gained, which demonstrated that heavy users reported receiving emotional support <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>experiencing</b> <b>offline</b> improvement more than medium and light users, and medium users reported these benefits more than light users. These findings suggest that contrary to some previous arguments regarding possible adverse consequences of intensive Internet use, heavy use of online depression communities is associated with positive results. Thus, it may even contribute to the general well-being of people with depression. Future research of the various associations between Internet use and psychological well-being should examine specific <b>online</b> activities, <b>and</b> explore diverse audiences including disadvantaged populations...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} rise of voluntary associations of ¡°donkey friends,¡± accompanied {{by the emergence of}} new types of cultural identities, interpersonal relationships, and social networks in contemporary urban China. At the end of the 1990 s, the native term ¡°donkey friend¡± (l¨¹you Â¿ÓÑ) became a popular self-identifier for Chinese backpackers who formed voluntary communities to facilitate group travels and many collective activities. My research is based on three months of preliminary field research in 2003 and 2004, and a year of fieldwork in 2005 in Beijing, Yunnan Province and Inner Mongolia. I carried out participant observation in three voluntary donkey friend communities, and conducted anthropological interviews with donkey friends, journalists, tourist guides, professors, and publishers. My field research was multisited, including face-to-face interaction in different locations and Internet research. The Internet phase is important because backpacker travel has co-evolved with the Internet forums in China. Both <b>online</b> interaction <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> travel <b>experience</b> served to cultivate a sense of fellowship among travelers. Donkey friend communities have not only provided social and emotional support for their members, but also allowed individuals to engage in various voluntary projects based on free association, self regulation, and practices of many democratic values. By contextualizing this phenomenon with the retreat of the state from many public realms of Chinese society, I argue that donkey friend community demonstrates {{the rise of}} the new public sphere of middle class in post-socialist urban China. Participants in this sphere no longer pose a direct threat to the state, but aim to promote cultural change, challenge cultural values, and raise public consciousness. They seek to practice democratic values and resolve specific social problems. This research not only offers an ethnographically-based study of new cultural forms that accompany the development of backpacker tourism in China, but also contributes to the anthropology of China by providing a detailed analysis of the formation of new urban communities and public spheres in which neoliberal values of production and consumption can be challenged by the emergence of new forms of cultural identities, horizontal ties, and collective actions...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} {{investigation}} {{in this research}} was the online performativity of gender and sexuality, and their relation to virtual spaces based on the analysis of a gay dating platform. Virtual gay dating is defined as an activity of gay subjects inserted in the contemporary digital universe, which turn gay sexualities in cyberspace into objects of visibility beyond national borders. Connecting gay users from around the world, these gay dating websites make up a global geography of gay sexuality in terms of strategies of seduction {{in the search for}} partners. As case study for this research, gay sexualities were observed in their relationship with the online universe within the gay dating webpage GayRomeo. This frame allowed me to analyze the connection between performativity theory and the use of new technologies, thus defining the research questions as following: 1) Which performances of gender and sexuality are affirmed in the GayRomeo online dating webpage? How can online performativity be investigated? In which extent is it possible to avoid constructivist reductionism? 2) Which is the constitutive relationship of these new performativities with virtualization processes that tie space to sexuality in a conception of symmetrical agency between human and nonhuman actors? This research was structured in: first, there was a theoretical discussion anticipating the fieldwork that consisted in constructing a genealogy of gender and sexuality categories with current contributions of investigations from the cultural and social sciences on sexuality, gender and technologies. All of these previous theories problematized an anthropocentric epistemology, assuming a type of agency that still focused greatly on a conscious and autonomous subject. The fieldwork consisted in a participant observation of the page together with semi-structured interviews with 17 gay users from Brazil, Germany, Mexico and Austria. Data analysis of the interviews consisted in checking with the actors their appropriations of the platform and how these appropriations articulated the users' <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> sexual <b>experiences,</b> also aiming to understand the basis of the difference between <b>offline</b> <b>and</b> <b>online</b> dating <b>and</b> the kind of dating experiences users relayed. This research demonstrated that the online gay dating platforms are conclusively a new space of our contemporaneity in which sexuality entangled the public and private domains, blurring their boundaries. There was a queer archive becoming evident precisely with the mix of normative orders. What the individual use of the page revealed, in this investigation, is that distinct codes and relations with sexuality appeared in users' daily experiences. On the one hand, some users clung to gender performances more guided by a heteronormative pattern, creating coherence between gender identity and sexuality, which is reflected in the reports of many when they appealed to hegemonic figures of masculinity. On the other hand, many users reported strategies of (dis) identification with the mainstream gay culture, facing unfamiliarity with some aspects on the platform, such as having to define a gender. These aspects contradicted a uniform perspective on gay identity. That is, a "global gay identity" cannot be defended, by considering the daily use of the page that indicates multiple lines of corporeality and sexuality...|$|R
40|$|Despite having {{difficulties}} {{in the areas of}} social interaction and communication, the introduction of the Internet seems to have encouraged some high-functioning autistic people {{to communicate with each other}} via chat rooms and bulletin boards. The Internet can address the social isolation of autism by improving the potential to find others who have similar experiences. Additionally it may be that, for autistic people, the Internet also offers a comfortable space more suited to their communication style, perhaps one in which their interaction seems less odd. If so, there are possible implications for this group of people in terms of education, employment and social inclusion. However there are risks. Autistic people may be particularly vulnerable to individuals misrepresenting themselves or to the possibility of over-reliance on computer-mediated interaction resulting in an exacerbation of obsessive behaviour and withdrawal from face-to-face interaction. An initial survey, to discover the extent of Internet use among people with autism and investigate their motivations for using it, was carried out, obtaining responses from 138 people with high-functioning autism or Asperger syndrome. Results indicated a high level of computer and Internet use amongst respondents and implied that email was a popular means of communication, more so than face-to-face communication even when interacting with friends. This introductory survey raised issues and questions which were explored in more depth with a subset of the respondents who were interviewed by email about their experiences, motivations and perceptions regarding Internet-based communication. In addition to 19 email interviews, data were also collected from 4 non or reluctant users of the Internet who were sent a series of questions by post. A grounded theory analysis of the data revealed a heightened awareness of communication amongst this group of participants, who offered insights into the process of communication in terms of its component parts and how it breaks down for them. Central to the analysis is a theme of the interviewee as observer, feeling detached to some degree from mainstream interaction and like an outsider. From this perspective participants offered their analysis of the complex process of communication, <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> as they <b>experienced</b> it, highlighting key aspects of the Internet in relation to their own needs, ones which made it a unique form of communication. Their insights into communication are described in four themes: control, clarity, the role of nonverbal communication and the social role of communication. Additionally the interviewees expressed a sense of liberation that could come with online communication for people with Asperger syndrome/high-functioning autism such that they may interact with others on a more equal basis. This could be empowering but with the sense of liberation there was a risk of losing control over one’s interactions. The interviewees’ perceptions of CMC are explored within a uses and gratifications framework which posits that people use particular communication channels to satisfy their individual needs and motives. By using computer-mediated communication some of the social and communication barriers which contribute to the disability of autism may be broken down.

This study {{looked at}} the {{exchange}} of <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> social capital {{among a group of}} people who share both an online network (Twitter users) and live in the same offline community (Wichita, Kansas). The study, recognizing that communities are social networks, utilized a triangulated methodology including a survey, focus groups and a case study to analyze social capital in <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> networks, similarities <b>and</b> differences in the experience of social capital <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline,</b> <b>and</b> the transference of social capital between <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> networks. Results indicate the presence of both <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> bridging <b>and</b> bonding relationships and the transference of social capital between them. Implications of these findings for the enhancement of offline communities are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper will}} discuss hybrid {{communities}} that connect users online {{with the intention}} of facilitating offline interaction.   These electronic-to-face (e 2 f) communities provide social benefits to members through the unique interaction of their <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> components. They offer members the opportunity to pursue new <b>offline</b> <b>experiences,</b> increase social capital and develop weak-tie relationships. To develop an environment that encourages members to participate <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline,</b> the physical design of e 2 f systems should include functionality that encourages a sense of community, trust and generalized reciprocity.  Following a set of e 2 f development guidelines proposed by the author, a new e 2 f system called Mix It Up was created. It aims to provide the social benefits of an increased social circle by enabling users to connect online with the purpose of meeting people to organize <b>and</b> enjoy activity-driven <b>offline</b> <b>experiences.</b> By engaging in an online community, members can be exposed to new offline opportunities that are not currently available in their limited offline social realms. Utilizing user research, this community was evaluated in reference to suggested conceptual points of departure for the creation of e 2 f communities...|$|R

40|$|Background: Despite the {{increasing}} popularity of videogame playing, {{little is known}} about the similarities <b>and</b> differences between <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> videogame players. However, the characteristics of <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> gaming might predispose different pattern of problematic use. Objectives: The aims of this study were to (i) test applicability and the measurement invariance of the previously developed Problematic Online Gaming Questionnaire (POGQ) in both <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> gamers; <b>and</b> (ii) examine the differences between <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> gamers in the dimensions of problematic use. Methods: A total of 1, 964 adolescent videogame players were recruited. Information on videogame use habits were collected and all gamers were administered the POGQ. Those gamers who played at least sometimes in an online context were considered as “online gamers” and “offline gamers” were those who played videogames exclusively offline. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis supported the measurement invariance across <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> videogame players. According to the multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) model, online gamers were more likely to score higher on overuse, interpersonal conflict, and social isolation subscales of the POGQ. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> gaming can be assessed using the same psychometric instrument. These findings open the possibility for future research studies concerning problematic video game to include participants who exclusively play either online or offline games, or both. However, the study also identified important structural features about how <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> gaming might contribute differently to problematic use. These results provide important information and ideas that could be utilized in parental education and prevention program about the possible detrimental consequences of online vs. offline video game use...|$|R
50|$|However, other cyber-ethnographers {{have argued}} that {{difference}} between <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> selves {{is similar to the}} different identity performances that occur in other contexts. This perspective views identity issues in cyber-ethnography as consistent with those of traditional ethnography. Researchers should thus consider how community members relate their <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> selves. If it is normal for community members to bring together their <b>online</b> <b>and</b> <b>offline</b> identities <b>and</b> meet face-to-face then it makes sense that the ethnographer should observe or participate in these offline interactions in order to fully understand the community as was done by Sherry Turkle.|$|R
