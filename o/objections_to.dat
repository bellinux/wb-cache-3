What government is to be regarded here as representative of a foreign sovereign state is a political rather than a judicial question, and is to be determined by the political department of the government. That authority is not limited to a determination of the government to be recognized. It includes the power to determine the policy which is to govern the question of recognition. <b>Objections</b> <b>to</b> the underlying policy as well as <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> recognition are to be addressed to the political department and not to the courts.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preparation}} of the new constitution for West Germany, discussions regarding its national symbols took place in August 1948 during a meeting at Herrenchiemsee. Although there were <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> the creation of a national flag before reunification with the east, it was decided to proceed. This decision was primarily motivated by the proposed constitution by the eastern SED in November 1946, where black-red-gold were suggested as the colours for a future German republic.|$|E

5|$|Other common <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> {{evolution}} {{allege that}} evolution leads to objectionable results, including bad beliefs, behaviors, and events.

Helped along by the independent voice of the Squadrone Volante, the cardinals settled on Chigi. Only Olimpia Maidalchini was left to be convinced.

5|$|Some of {{the oldest}} and most common <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> {{evolution}} dispute whether evolution can truly account for all the apparent complexity and order in the natural world. It is argued that evolution is too unlikely or otherwise lacking to account for various aspects of life, and therefore that an intelligence, such as God of the Abrahamic religions, must at the very least be appealed to for those specific features.|$|E

5|$|There {{were serious}} {{scientific}} <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> {{the process of}} natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Karl von Nägeli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that {{the age of the}} Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of the age of the Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|As was {{the case}} with many of Heinlein's books, Starship Troopers was {{completed}} in a few weeks. It was originally written as a juvenile novel for New York publishing house Scribner; Heinlein had previously had success with this format, having written several such novels published by Scribner. The manuscript was rejected, prompting Heinlein to end his association with the publisher completely, and resume writing books with adult themes. Scholars have suggested that Scribner's rejection was based on ideological <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> the content of the novel, particularly its treatment of military conflict.|$|E

5|$|Browning's {{dealings}} with the British Army were no smoother. His successor as commander of the 1st Airborne Division, Major-General Hopkinson, had sold the British Eighth Army commander, General Sir Bernard Montgomery, on Operation Ladbroke, a glider landing to seize the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse. Browning's <b>objections</b> <b>to</b> the operation were ignored, and attempts to discuss airborne operations with the corps commanders elicited a directive from Montgomery that all such discussion {{had to go through}} him.
