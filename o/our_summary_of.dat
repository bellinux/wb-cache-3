6000|$|SUMMARY. What we call {{eighteenth-century}} literature appeared [...] {{between two}} great political upheavals, the English Revolution of [...] 1688 and the French Revolution of 1789. Some {{of the chief}} [...] characteristics of that literature--such as the emphasis on form, [...] the union of poetry with politics, the prevalence of satire, the [...] interest in historical subjects--have been accounted for, in part [...] at least, in <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> {{the history of the}} period.|$|E
60|$|THE QUALITY OF GEORGE ELIOT. Of {{the moral}} quality of George Eliot {{we have already}} said enough. To <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> her method this should be added, that she tried to make each of her {{characters}} not individual but typical. In other words, if Tito came finally to grief, and Adam arrived at a state of gloomy satisfaction (there is no real happiness in George Eliot's world), it was not because Tito and Adam lived in different times or circumstances, but because both were {{subject to the same}} eternal laws. Each must have gone to his own place whether he lived in wealth or poverty, in Florence or England, in the fifteenth or the nineteenth century. The moral law is universal and unchanging; it has no favorites, and makes no exceptions. It is more like the old Greek conception of Nemesis, or the Anglo-Saxon conception of Wyrd, or Fate, than anything else you will find in modern fiction.|$|E
6000|$|Appended to {{the play}} is an {{entertaining}} though somewhat mysterious document called [...] "The Revolutionist's Handbook." [...] It contains many very sound remarks; this, for example, which I cannot too much applaud: [...] "If you hit your child, {{be sure that you}} hit him in anger." [...] If that principle had been properly understood, we should have had less of Shaw's sociological friends and their meddling with the habits and instincts of the poor. But among the fragments of advice also occurs the following suggestive and even alluring remark: [...] "Every man over forty is a scoundrel." [...] On the first personal opportunity I asked the author of this remarkable axiom what it meant. I gathered that what it really meant was something like this: that every man over forty had been all the essential use that he was likely to be, and was therefore in a manner a parasite. It is gratifying to reflect that Bernard Shaw has sufficiently answered his own epigram by continuing to pour out treasures both of truth and folly long after this allotted time. But if the epigram might be interpreted in a rather looser style as meaning that past a certain point a man's work takes on its final character and does not greatly change the nature of its merits, it may certainly be said that with Man and Superman, Shaw reaches that stage. The two plays that have followed it, though of very great interest in themselves, do not require any revaluation of, or indeed any addition to, <b>our</b> <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> his genius and success. They are both in a sense casts back to his primary energies; the first in a controversial and the second in a technical sense. Neither need prevent our saying that the moment when John Tanner and Anne agree that it is doom for him and death for her and life only for the thing unborn, is the peak of his utterance as a prophet.|$|E

40|$|Background: Ganciclovir, a drug against {{cytomegalovirus}} (CMV) infection, {{is generally}} well tolerated, but can cause neurotoxicity such as encephalopathy. Although ganciclovir-induced encephalopathy {{has been described}} in several reports, a literature search revealed that ganciclovir concentrations in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid were previously measured in only 3 patients with encephalopathy. Symptoms usually include confusion and disturbed consciousness, which mimic CMV encephalitis. Prompt and accurate diagnosis is thus sometimes difficult, and is derived solely from accumulated clinical information of definite cases, since ganciclovir concentrations, not routinely measured, become available after several days or a few weeks. Case Presentation: Here, we summarize clinical information of all patients with definite ganciclovir-induced encephalopathy including our own patient, who had severe symptoms, with the highest reported trough concentration of ganciclovir in the blood, and underwent therapeutic dialysis with complete recovery. Conclusion: <b>Our</b> <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> patients with definite encephalopathy could lead to prompt and accurate diagnoses...|$|E
40|$|Among vertebrates, most of {{the largest}} genomes are found within the salamanders, a clade of {{amphibians}} that includes 613 species. Salamander genome sizes range from ∼ 14 to ∼ 120 Gb. Because genome size is correlated with nucleus and cell sizes, {{as well as other}} traits, morphological evolution in salamanders has been profoundly affected by genomic gigantism. However, the molecular mechanisms driving genomic expansion in this clade remain largely unknown. Here, we present the first comparative analysis of transposable element (TE) content in salamanders. Using high-throughput sequencing, we generated genomic shotgun data for six species from the Plethodontidae, the largest family of salamanders. We then developed a pipeline to mine TE sequences from shotgun data in taxa with limited genomic resources, such as salamanders. <b>Our</b> <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> overall TE abundance and diversity for each species demonstrate that TEs make up a substantial portion of salamander genomes, and that all of the major known types of TEs are represented in salamanders. The most abundant TE superfamilies found in the genomes of our six focal species are similar, despite substantial variation in genome size. However, our results demonstrate a major difference between salamanders and other vertebrates: salamander genomes contain much larger amounts of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons, primarily Ty 3 /gypsy elements. Thus, the extreme increase in genome size that occurred in salamanders was likely accompanied by a shift in TE landscape. These results suggest that increased proliferation of LTR retrotransposons was a major molecular mechanism contributing to genomic expansion in salamanders...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Oxytocin {{presents}} an exciting potential {{to target the}} core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) pharmacologically in an easily administered, cost-effective form with possibly minimal adverse effects. But, there are still major gaps {{in this area of}} research. This paper reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of oxytocin administration on social cognition and restricted, repetitive behaviors in individuals with an ASD. Method: Electronic literature searches were conducted from PsycINFO, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, and EMBASE for RCTs published through June 2015. Results: 12 RCTs were included in this review. 7 out of the 11 studies that examined social cognition reported improvements.

40|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{thorough}} research showing many positive benefits of school choice. However, many questions remain on how school choice works. Rigorous school choice experiments can only determine if access to school choice programs alters student outcomes; they cannot confidently identify the specific mechanisms that mediate various outcomes. Two commonly theorized mechanisms in school choice programs that lead to positive outcomes are (1) an increased access to higher-quality schools and (2) an improved match between schools and students. We examine the existing empirical evidence and the theoretical arguments for these two primary mechanisms. While there is evidence supporting both mechanisms, no studies are able to isolate the effect of quality schools independent of families selecting schools that match their preferences. Since the majority of this research is descriptive and has limited causal interpretation, theory is essential in guiding interpretation and policy implications. Theory suggests that people make choices based on what they believe to be the best match for their children, and those choices lead to incentives for individual schools to improve.
