He was {{planning}} his wedding {{at the end}} of his term in Latin America but was persuaded to postpone it due to the urgency with which he was required in Canberra, and the wedding eventually took place later in 1972. The couple had three children, but his wife did not enjoy the <b>overseas</b> postings. They <b>divorced</b> in 1984 and Penfold travelled to Kampala alone. While in Uganda, Penfold met his second wife-to-be, Celia, who was working for the World Bank. They married while Penfold was Governor of the British Virgin Islands, making Penfold the first British governor to get married in-post. Both Penfold and his wife consider themselves committed Christians, and Penfold has stated that, [...] "as a Christian, I have felt more at home in Africa".|$|R
