Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on his official website: [...] "Apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me." [...] MTV replied that it respected Reznor's point of view, but was [...] "uncomfortable" [...] with the performance being [...] "built around partisan political statements". A performance by Foo Fighters replaced Nine Inch Nails' time slot on the show. [...] During the Lights in the Sky tour in 2008, some performances of [...] "The Hand that Feeds" [...] had the image of Bush on a video screen behind the band.

[...] He cited three reasons for dropping out: (1) the criteria of the Commission on Presidential Debates, which would have made it [...] "impossible" [...] for him to qualify for general election debates; (2) the rise of the presidential campaign <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>McCain,</b> whose similar message would have made a contrast difficult; and (3) the exit of Ventura from the Reform Party.

500|$|In any case, Biden {{would not}} run {{again for the}} {{presidency}} until his 2008 campaign, twenty years later. This time {{he made it to}} the Iowa caucuses, but withdrew after a poor showing. [...] Meanwhile, Biden and Kinnock had become close friends after the plagiarism incident. Meeting in August 2008, after Biden had been chosen by Democratic nominee Barack Obama as his running mate, Biden introduced Kinnock to his Senate staff by saying: “Hey, you people! Do you know this guy? He used to be my greatest speechwriter.” [...] Obama and Biden proceeded to win the general election against the Republican ticket <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>McCain</b> and Sarah Palin; Biden's 1988 campaign lapses were never a significant issue in the race, and Biden invited Kinnock to the inauguration. Additionally, Biden also won the Delaware Senate election the same year, and would've been the longest serving Senator in Delaware history, had the McCain/Palin ticket been elected. In 2015, Biden considered a possible 2016 presidential bid, but declined it on October 21, 2015, the same year his son Beau died of brain cancer.

500|$|After much speculation, Trump officially {{decided to}} run for {{president}} as a Republican in 2016, using the motto [...] "Make America Great Again." [...] In his announcement speech in June 2015, Trump took a tough stance against illegal immigration and promised to build a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border if elected president. [...] After announcing, Trump became the front-runner for the nomination, taking the lead in nearly every national poll, ahead of his rivals for the Republican nomination including Jeb Bush, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. [...] Trump styled himself as the candidate of anti-establishment Republicans and received praise from former rival Pat Buchanan, who compared Trump's run to Buchanan's 1992 and 1996 campaigns. [...] His attacks on the Republican establishment included a slight against the war hero status <b>of</b> <b>John</b> <b>McCain,</b> whom Trump complimented during his 2000 campaign. [...] Republican voters favored the purported honesty of Trump's message and his abrasive approach, which eschewed political correctness. Roger Stone, who headed Trump's 2000 presidential committee, served as an adviser for the 2016 campaign until a much publicized split in August 2015. The campaign generated major media attention and attracted large crowds to campaign events. [...] Trump won multiple Republican primaries, receiving more votes than any previous Republican candidate, and earned the party's presidential nomination at the 2016 Republican National Convention.
