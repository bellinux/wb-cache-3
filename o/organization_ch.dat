40|$|Sesquiterpene lactones (SLs) are plant-derived {{compounds}} that display anti-cancer effects.

30|$|In 1997 and 1998, {{a strong}} El Niño event {{collided}} with widespread agricultural burning practices in Indonesia, igniting extensive peatlands.

An estimated 20 million people experienced respiratory illnesses (World Health <b>Organization</b> 1998). Because <b>CH</b> 4 is released from burning peat, and because the Global Warming Potential of CH 4 is 79 to 105 times that of CO 2 over a 20 year time span (Shindell et al. 2009, Myhre et al. 2013), {{it is essential that}} we address fire where peat soils dominate.|$|R
40|$|Retinal {{melatonin}} {{is involved}} in the modulation of many important retinal functions. Our previous {{studies have shown that the}} viability of photoreceptors and ganglion cells is reduced during aging in mice that lack melatonin receptor type 1. This demonstrates that melatonin signaling is important for the survival of retinal neurons. In the present study, we investigate the effects of aging on photoreceptor physiology and retinal <b>organization</b> in <b>CH</b> 3 -f+/+ mice, a melatonin proficient mouse strain. Our data indicate that the amplitude of the a and b waves of the scotopic and photopic electroretinogram decreases with age. Moreover, the daily rhythm in the amplitude of the a- and b- waves is lost during the aging process. Similarly, the scotopic threshold response is significantly affected by aging, but only when it is measured during the night. Interestingly, the changes observed in the ERGs are not paralleled by relevant changes in retinal morphological features, and administration of exogenous melatonin does not affect the ERGs in C 3 H-f+/+ at 12 months of age. This suggests that the responsiveness of the photoreceptors to exogenous melatonin is reduced during aging...|$|R

Hawley pursued his Ph.D at the University of Michigan where he was mentored by Roderick McKenzie. McKenzie suffered from a degenerative disease and while he slowly succumbed he assigned Hawley to teach a few of his classes. Hawley was appointed as an instructor in the Sociology department after turning in his dissertation and McKenzie's death in 1940. Hawley was a professor and the Chairman of the Department of Sociology at the University of Michigan. While teaching Hawley printed the 1950 book Human Ecology, which had an international effect on the field of sociology. Hawley taught as professor at Michigan from 1941 to 1966, he served as chair of the Sociology department at University of Michigan for ten years (1951-1961).|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{aimed to develop}} a pre-endothelialized {{chitosan}} (CH) porous hollowed scaffold for application in spinal cord regenerative therapies. CH conduits with different degrees of acetylation (DA; 4 % and 15 %) were prepared, characterized (microstructure, porosity and water uptake) and functionalized with a recombinant fragment of human fibronectin (rhFNIII 7 – 10). Immobilized rhFNIII 7 – 10 was characterized in terms of amount (125 I-radiolabelling), exposure of cell-binding domains (immunofluorescence) and ability to mediate endothelial cell (EC) adhesion and cytoskeletal rearrangement. Functionalized conduits revealed a linear increase in immobilized rhFNIII 7 – 10 with rhFNIII 7 – 10 concentration, and, for the same concentration, higher amounts of rhFNIII 7 – 10 on DA 4 % compared with DA 15 %. Moreover, rhFNIII 7 – 10 concentrations as low as 5 and 20 lgml 1 in the coupling reaction were shown to provide DA 4 % and 15 % scaffolds, respectively, with levels of exposed cell-binding domains exceeding those observed on the control (DA 4 % scaffolds incubated in a 20 lgml 1 human fibronectin solution). These grafting conditions proved {{to be effective in}} mediating EC adhesion/cytoskeletal <b>organization</b> on <b>CH</b> with DA 4 % and 15 %, without affecting the endothelial angiogenic potential. rhFNIII 7 – 10 grafting to CH could be a strategy of particular interest in tissue engineering applications requiring the use of endothelialized porous matrices with tunable degradation rates...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the MONICA project is ''To measure the trends and determinants in cardiovascular mortality and coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease morbidity and to assess {{the extent to which}} these trends are related to changes in known risk factors, daily living habits, health care, or major socio-economic features measured at the same time in defined communities in different countries''. The project was initiated in 26 countries in the early 1980 s. Risk factors are monitored through three independent cross-sectional population surveys in the beginning, the middle and at the end of the ten year observation period. According to the MONICA Manual (World Health Organization; 1986, 1990), risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia and obesity are of major interest. (orig.)

International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 18 (4). doi: 10. 3390 /ijms 18040702 Chitin biosynthesis in yeast is accomplished by three chitin synthases (Chs) termed Chs 1, Chs 2 and Chs 3, of which the latter accounts {{for most of the}} chitin deposited within the cell wall. While the overall structures of Chs 1 and Chs 2 {{are similar to those of}} other chitin synthases from fungi and arthropods, Chs 3 lacks some of the C-terminal transmembrane helices raising questions regarding its structure and topology. To fill this gap of knowledge, we performed bioinformatic analyses and protease protection assays that revealed significant information about the catalytic domain, the chitin-translocating channel and the interfacial helices in between. In particular, we identified an amphipathic, crescent-shaped α-helix attached to the inner side of the membrane that presumably controls the channel entrance and a finger helix pushing the polymer into the channel. Evidence has accumulated in the past years that chitin synthases form oligomeric complexes, which may be necessary for the formation of chitin nanofibrils. However, the functional significance for living yeast cells has remained elusive. To test Chs 3 oligomerization in vivo, we used bimolecular fluorescence complementation. We detected oligomeric complexes at the bud neck, the lateral plasma membrane, and in membranes of Golgi vesicles, and analyzed their transport route using various trafficking mutants. © 2017 by the authors.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of 12 -week indacaterol therapy on daytime physical activity in patients with untreated COPD. Methods: The subjects were stable and untreated COPD outpatients with a percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%FEV 1) below 80 %. Baseline assessments included clinical assessment, respiratory function testing, arterial blood gas analysis, the COPD assessment test (CAT™), and the Medical Outcomes Study 36 -Item Short-Form Health Survey, Japanese version 2 (SF- 36 v 2 ®). Patients underwent monitoring by uniaxial accelerometer before and after 12  weeks once-daily inhalation of indacaterol 150 µg/day. Results: Eighteen patients were evaluable. Patient characteristics included a mean age of 74. 2 years, and three patients were current smokers. Indacaterol improved mean (± standard deviation [SD]) %FEV 1 from 55. 2 % (± 17. 9 %) to 61. 0 % (± 17. 3 %) (P= 0. 003), CAT scores from 16. 4 (± 10. 2) points to 12. 4 (± 8. 2) points (P= 0. 04), some scales of the SF- 36 v 2 (physical component summary, 41. 6 ± 9. 7 points to 45. 1 ± 7. 9 points, P= 0. 03), and number of daily steps (3, 311. 5 ± 2, 103. 3 steps/day to 3, 841. 8 ± 2, 096. 8 steps/day, P= 0. 02), but did not affect daily energy expenditure (85. 0 ± 77. 2 kcal change to 90. 9 ± 56. 8 kcal, P= 0. 29) or exercise duration of an intensity of level 1 or more (36. 4 ± 23. 9 minutes increase to 40. 8 ± 21. 6 minutes, P= 0. 12).

As a part of this international project, the MONICA Augsburg Coronary Event Register has been in operation since 1 October 1984 to assess the risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in a defined population of South Germany (2, 3). Data are annually transferred to the MONICA Data Center in Helsinki (1) in two separate formats. One format corresponds to the Coronary Event Form 01 and primarily addresses the first hypothesis.
