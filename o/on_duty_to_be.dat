40|$|Based on {{input from}} {{representatives of the}} Short Line Railroad Association (ASLRRA) it is {{apparent}} that there is an issue with the impact of the hours of Service rules as generated by the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 that creates difficulty for short line railroad operators during peak harvest season. Since the service demands are very extreme it is difficult for crews to operate within the time constraints. Consequently, there <b>is</b> a need <b>to</b> address ways to assist operating crews in better managing the fatigue associated with long hours of work. The Hours of Service law (HSL), first enacted in 1907 and most recently amended in 2008, control how many hours train employees, dispatching service employees, and signal employees may work. The statute provides maximum on-duty periods for each group of employees, minimum off-duty periods for train employees and signal employees, and establishes how time <b>on</b> <b>duty</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> calculated. The statute also provides additional limitations on consecutive-days and certain monthly limitations on the activity of train employees. In the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, FRA received regulatory authority to establish hours of service limitations for train employees providing commuter and intercity rail passenger transportation service and on August 12, 2011, FRA published its final rule providing new limitations for passenger train employees which necessitated the evaluation of work schedules for risk of fatigue. In previous studies in railroad operational settings crew work schedules <b>were</b> analyzed <b>to</b> {{determine the extent to which}} persons working long hours were experiencing excessive levels of fatigue.

The thesis presents in a concise form the relevant Czech case law, in particular the decisions issued by the Supreme Court. The thesis is composed of eight main chapters, each of them dealing with different aspects of contractual penalty and default interest. Chapter One is introductory and defines basic terminology, which is used in the thesis. Furthermore, it analyzes the purpose of contractual penalty and default interest, legislation in force, the historical evolution of legislation and the foreign legislation involved. Chapter Two examines an agreement on contractual penalty and default interest, its alternation and a simultaneous agreement on contractual penalty and default interest.

40|$|The central {{question}} of this thesis <b>is</b> <b>to</b> what extent affluent individuals ought {{to help the}} global poor. In hope of answering this question, I will turn to three approaches to ethics: consequentialism, Kantianism and Williams’ a-theoretical approach. However, I will argue {{that none of these}} approaches can answer the question satisfactorily. Consequentialism tells us that our duty is extremely demanding, but fails to provide convincing arguments for this claim. Kantianism <b>is</b> unable <b>to</b> tell us whether to assign more weight to impartial demands or to personal demands. And while the a-theoretical approach leads to an upper limit <b>on</b> our <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> aid, this limit is very imprecise and it is uncertain whether we should accept Williams’ arguments for it. The three approaches do tell us what the lower limit <b>on</b> our <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> aid <b>is.</b> If we <b>are</b> <b>to</b> live a morally decent life, we <b>are</b> required <b>to</b> give some aid to the poor, even if it takes a little sacrifice. While this is an important find, it leaves us with a lot of uncertainty about the demandingness of our <b>duty</b> <b>to</b> aid. The fact that there is so much uncertainty about a topic that is so significant, renders it important to ask questions about the reason why we do not have clear answers. I will argue that this reason may be found in our human nature...|$|R

50|$|The two Commissioners {{were almost}} entirely {{responsible}} for the organisation of the new force. In twelve weeks, they managed to recruit, train, organise, equip and deploy a force of nearly one thousand men. They drew up regulations and pay scales, designed and ordered uniforms and equipment, and found, purchased and furnished station houses. Rowan's military experience led to the division of London into six divisions, each divided into eight sections, each of which was divided into eight beats. The beat system, with each constable almost overlapping the next, {{was based on the}} Shorncliffe System for light infantry, devised by Sir John Moore, Rowan's commander in the Peninsula (and who had paid for his captaincy in 1803). It is possible that it <b>was</b> Rowan's idea <b>to</b> outfit the police in more civilian-styled blue uniforms rather than the scarlet and gold that Peel had originally envisaged. Since there was heated debate over whether the police should even be uniformed at all (due to fears of a European-style gendarmerie), this was undoubtedly a wise move. Rowan did, however, insist that his men were drilled and laid down the highest standards of conduct, dismissing men for the slightest infringement even before the police had begun patrolling the streets of London. During {{the first two years of}} the force's existence, half of its original constables were dismissed, mainly for drunkenness, absenteeism, and frequenting pubs and fraternising with prostitutes while <b>on</b> <b>duty.</b> Officers <b>were</b> <b>to</b> ensure that they treated members of the public with respect and courtesy at all times. On the other hand, Rowan insisted that his senior officers treat their men with kindness and fairness and without undue harshness or authoritarianism. On 16 September 1829, the two Commissioners personally swore in their new constables at the Foundling Hospital. The new force first took to the streets at 6:00 p.m. on 29 September.|$|R
