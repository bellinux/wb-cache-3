500|$|Because {{only five}} {{terrestrial}} orders of mammals {{have made it}} to the island, each likely to have derived from a single colonization, and since these colonizations date to either the early Cenozoic or the early Miocene, the conditions for oceanic dispersal to Madagascar seem to have been better during two separate periods in the past. A report published in January 2010 supported this assumption by demonstrating that both Madagascar and Africa were [...] south of their present-day positions around 60mya, placing them in a different <b>ocean</b> <b>gyre</b> and reversing the strong current that presently flows away from Madagascar. [...] The currents were even shown to be stronger than they are today, shortening the rafting time to approximately 30 days or less, making the crossing much easier for a small mammal. [...] Over time, as the continental plates drifted northward, the currents gradually changed, and by 20mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed.|$|E
500|$|Once {{part of the}} supercontinent Gondwana, {{the island}} of Madagascar has been {{isolated}} since it broke away from eastern Africa (~160mya), Antarctica (~80–130mya), and India (~80–90mya). Since ancestral lemurs {{are thought to have}} originated in Africa around 62 to 65mya, they must have crossed the Mozambique Channel, a deep channel between Africa and Madagascar with a minimum width of about 560km (350mi). In 1915, paleontologist William Diller Matthew noted that the mammalian biodiversity on Madagascar (including lemurs) can only be accounted for by random rafting events, where very small populations rafted from nearby Africa on tangled mats of vegetation, which get flushed out to sea from major rivers. This form of biological dispersal can occur randomly over millions of years. In the 1940s, American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson coined the term [...] "sweepstakes hypothesis" [...] for such random events. Rafting has since been the most accepted explanation for the lemur colonization of Madagascar, but until recently this trip was thought to be very unlikely because strong ocean currents flow away from the island. In , a report demonstrated that around 60mya both Madagascar and Africa were 1,650km (1,030mi) south of their present-day positions, placing them in a different <b>ocean</b> <b>gyre,</b> producing currents that ran counter to what they are today. The ocean currents were shown to be even stronger than today, which would have pushed a raft along faster, shortening the trip to 30days or less—short enough for a small mammal to survive easily. As the continental plates drifted northward, the currents gradually changed, and by 20mya the window for oceanic dispersal had closed, effectively isolating the lemurs {{and the rest of the}} terrestrial Malagasy fauna from mainland Africa. Isolated on Madagascar with only a limited number of mammalian competitors, the lemurs did not have to compete with other evolving arboreal mammalian groups, such as squirrels. They were also spared from having to compete with monkeys, which evolved later. The intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness of monkeys gave them an advantage over other primates in exploiting the environment.|$|E

2500|$|Scientific {{experiments}} involving drift objects—more generally called determinate drifters—provide {{information about}} currents and help researchers develop ocean circulation maps. For example, experiments {{conducted in the}} mid-1700s by Benjamin Franklin and others indicated the existence and approximate location of the Gulf Stream, with scientific confirmation following in the mid-1800s. Using a network of beachcomber informants, rear admiral Alexander Becher {{is believed to be}} the first (from 1808-1852) to study travel of so-called [...] "bottle papers" [...] around an <b>ocean</b> <b>gyre</b> (a large circulating current system). In the late 1800s, Albert I, Prince of Monaco determined that the Gulf Stream branched into the North Atlantic Drift and the Azores Current. In the 1890s, Scottish scientist T. Wemyss Fulton released floating bottles and wooden slips to chart North Sea surface currents for the first time. Releasing bottles designed to remain a short distance above the sea bed, British marine biologist George Parker Bidder III first proved in the early twentieth century that deep sea currents flowed from east to west in the North Sea and that bottom feeders prefer to move against the current.|$|E

On the Indian Ocean leg of their trip, they travelled between Perth, Australia, and Port Louis, Mauritius (east of Madagascar); each of the water samples they collected in the 4800 km between contained plastic. They found that the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>gyres</b> were affected in the same way as the North Pacific and North Atlantic gyres.

50|$|Normally moving counter-clockwise, in {{the winter}} the Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>gyre</b> reverses {{direction}} due to the seasonal winds of the South Asian Monsoon. In the summer, the land is warmer than the ocean, so surface winds blow from the ocean to the land. However, during the winter, these temperatures reverse, making the winds blow from the land to the ocean. Because most of the air pressure gradient is retained behind the Tibetan plateau, air pressure gradients over the Indian Ocean and the gyre are small. This results in winds of moderate strength, due to the protection from the full force winds blowing off the Mongolian high pressure region. Because of these moderate, dry winds, the Winter Monsoon season in the Indian Ocean region is the dry season for most of Southern Asia. Due to this seasonal wind cycle, the currents of the Indian Ocean, which make up the Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>gyre,</b> are directly affected, causing reversal.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{the other}} gyres, it {{contains}} a garbage patch. A garbage patch is a suspended region of marine debris within the water column that circulate the gyre constantly. The Indian Ocean’s garbage patch covers a massive area: at least five million square kilometers (two million square miles). [...] As garbage patches such as these circulate {{for long periods of}} time, they cause inorganic toxins to enter the food chain due to solar breakdown of plastics in the water. In the Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>gyre,</b> the garbage patch has been more of a mystery. Having just been discovered in 2010, it is still under research. It is known, however, that like most garbage patches, it is very fluid, and changes with the seasons, making its location difficult to pinpoint. It seems to circulate with the Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>gyre,</b> from the Australian side to the African side, down the African coast, and then back to Australia. According to the team who discovered the garbage patch, the full rotation of the gyre’s garbage patch takes about six years, until it reaches the center of the gyre, where it may remain indefinitely.|$|E
50|$|The {{underlying}} {{rocks are}} of upper Precambrian to lower Paleozoic age and are partly composed of calcium carbonate.

25|$|About 18 {{percent of}} litter, usually {{traveling}} through stormwater systems, {{ends up in}} local streams, rivers, and waterways.

5000|$|Ekman {{transport}} is also {{a factor}} in the circulation of the <b>ocean</b> <b>gyres.</b> Ekman transport causes water to flow {{toward the center of the}} gyre in all locations, creating a sloped sea-surface, and initiating geostrophic flow (Colling p 65). Harald Sverdrup applied Ekman transport while including pressure gradient forces to develop a theory for this (see Sverdrup balance). See: Garbage Patch ...|$|R
50|$|This {{build-up}} {{of water}} in the center creates flow towards the equator in the upper 1000 to 2000 m of the ocean, through rather complex dynamics. This flow is returned towards the pole in an intensified western boundary current. The boundary current of the North Atlantic Gyre is the Gulf Stream, of the North Pacific Gyre the Kuroshio Current, of the South Atlantic Gyre the Brazil Current, of the South Pacific Gyre the East Australian Current, and of the Indian <b>Ocean</b> <b>Gyre</b> the Agulhas Current.|$|E

5000|$|The Benguela Current [...] is the broad, northward flowing {{ocean current}} {{that forms the}} eastern portion of the South Atlantic <b>Ocean</b> <b>gyre.</b> The current extends from roughly Cape Point in the south, to the {{position}} of the Angola-Benguela front in the north, at around 16°S. The current is driven by the prevailing south easterly trade winds. Inshore of the Benguela Current proper, the south easterly winds drive coastal upwelling, forming the Benguela Upwelling System. The cold, nutrient rich waters that upwell from around 200-300 m depth in turn fuel high rates of phytoplankton growth, and sustain the productive Benguela ecosystem.|$|E
50|$|The {{majority}} of the litter near and in the ocean {{is made up of}} plastics. According to Dr. Marcus Eriksen of The 5 Gyres Institute, there are 5.25 trillion particles of plastic pollution that weigh as much as 270,000 tons (2016). This plastic is taken by the ocean currents and accumulates in large vortexes known as <b>ocean</b> <b>gyres.</b> The {{majority of}} the gyres become pollution dumps filled with plastic.|$|R
30|$|Boundary {{currents}} and <b>ocean</b> <b>gyres</b> are important elements in heat transport on Earth; they fundamentally control the Earth’s climate. The Kuroshio Current {{is a major}} western boundary current in the western Pacific Ocean; it {{plays a key role}} in distributing heat from the tropics to the mid-latitudes and has been an important control on the climate of Northeast Asian for millions of years. This paper reviews evidence for the Pliocene to recent history of the Kuroshio Current and the Tsushima Current.|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} the {{interaction}} between the midlatitude <b>ocean</b> <b>gyres</b> and the wind stress is formulated for a shallow-water, spherical hemisphere with finite thermocline displacement and the latitudinal dependence of the long Rossby wave speed. The oceanic currents create a temperature front at the midlatitude intergyre boundary that is strongest near {{the western part of the}} basin. The intergyre temperature front affects the atmospheric temperature gradient in the storm track region, increasing the eddy transport of heat and the surface westerlies. The delayed adjustment of the gyres to the wind stress causes the westerly maximum to migrate periodically in time with a decadal period. The behavior of the model in a spherical geometry is qualitatively similar to that in a quasigeostrophic setting except that here the coupled oscillation involves oceanic temperature anomalies that circulate around the subpolar gyre, whereas the quasigeostrophic calculations favor the subtropical gyre. Another difference is that here there is a linear relationship between the period of the coupled oscillation and the delay time for the adjustment of <b>ocean</b> <b>gyres</b> to changes in the wind stress. This result departs from the quasigeostrophic result, in which the advection timescale also influences the period of the decadal oscillation. 1...|$|R

50|$|The {{physics of}} western {{intensification}} {{can be understood}} through a mechanism that helps maintain the vortex balance along an <b>ocean</b> <b>gyre.</b> Harald Sverdrup was the first one, preceding Henry Stommel, to attempt to explain the mid-ocean vorticity balance {{by looking at the}} relationship between surface wind forcings and the mass transport within the upper ocean layer. He assumed a geostrophic interior flow, while neglecting any frictional or viscosity effects and presuming that the circulation vanishes at some depth in the ocean. This prohibited the application of his theory to the western boundary currents, since some form of dissipative effect (bottom Ekman layer) would be later shown to be necessary to predict a closed circulation for an entire ocean basin and to counteract the wind-driven flow.|$|E
