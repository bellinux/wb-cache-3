40|$|Abstract:- A {{disconnector}} for an <b>overvoltage</b> <b>protector</b> is {{equipment that}} disconnects a circuit when the <b>overvoltage</b> <b>protector</b> may fail {{in a short}} circuit mode. The disconnector and the <b>overvoltage</b> <b>protector</b> are connected in series. A fuse or a circuit breaker is normaly used as a disconnector. However {{there are problems with}} both methods. A fuse is not recyclable once it goes out. Even a circuit breaker is resetable, a lightning surge current causes a swichgear of circuit breaker to open unnecessary. This malfunction prevents the overvoltage protective function which eliminates a lightning surge current into an instrument. If the problem which a switchgear of circuit breaker comes floating can be solved, even when a lightning surge current flows through it, an instrument can be protected by the <b>overvoltage</b> <b>protector.</b> This paper presents a way of preventing circuit breker type disconnectors from the malfunction...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{beneficiary}} of Offshore Wind Farms (OWF) to land wind {{farms in the}} sense of more power productivity and land view disturbance leads to more investment and consideration. Nevertheless, the maintenance of OWFs is a significant issue due to accessibility and repair costs. Thus, the protection of OWFs electrical components should be investigated in various operation conditions such as energization, deenergization as well as lightning strikes to the blade of wind turbines. In this paper, the overvoltages due to energization are simulated and the impact of surge arresters and capacitive filters to protect wind turbine components is analyzed. Modeling of the components in OWF is considered based upon their frequency behavior. The significant components for energization studies are interconnecting cables, Wind Turbine Transformers (WTTs), surge arresters, vacuum circuit breakers as well. For modeling the cables, JMarti model is applied and model frequency is modified based on cable length. WTTs as the heart of wind farms are modeled based on vector fitting and transformer terminal measurements. Surge arresters as the main <b>overvoltage</b> <b>protector</b> is modeled considering stray lead inductances which degrade the efficiency of the surges arresters in reality. Simulation results indicate that energizing a row of OWF is actually similar to a ladder cables-transformers energization which LV terminal of transformers should be considered no load. The overvoltages in LV can reach up to 10 - 15 p. u. if surge arresters and capacitive filters are not installed. By the application of surge arresters and capacitive filters, the overvoltage peak and rate of rise of overvoltage (dU/dt) can be respectively controlled...|$|E

50|$|For {{one of the}} K Project tests, Soviet {{scientists}} instrumented a 570 km {{section of}} telephone line {{in the area that}} they expected to be affected by the pulse. The monitored telephone line was divided into sub-lines of 40 to 80 km in length, separated by repeaters. Each sub-line was protected by fuses and by gas-filled <b>overvoltage</b> <b>protectors.</b> The EMP from the 22 October (K-3) nuclear test (also known as Test 184) blew all of the fuses and fired all of the <b>overvoltage</b> <b>protectors</b> in all of the sub-lines.|$|R
50|$|The 1998 IEEE article, however, does {{contain a}} number of details about the {{measurements}} of EMP effects on the instrumented 570 km telephone line, including details about the fuses that were used and also about the gas-filled <b>overvoltage</b> <b>protectors</b> that were used on that communications line. According to that paper, the gas-filled <b>overvoltage</b> <b>protectors</b> fired {{as a result of}} the voltages induced by the fast E1 component of the EMP, and the fuses were blown as the result of the slow E3 component of the EMP, which caused geomagnetically induced currents in all of the sub-lines.|$|R
5000|$|The Soviet {{scientists}} instrumented a 570 km {{section of}} telephone {{line in the}} area that they expected to be affected by the nuclear detonation in order to measure the electromagnetic pulse effects. The electromagnetic pulse (EMP) fused all of the 570-kilometer monitored overhead telephone line with measured currents of 1500 to 3400 amperes during the 22 October 1962 test. [...] The monitored telephone line was divided into sub-lines of 40 to 80 km in length, separated by repeaters. Each sub-line was protected by fuses and by gas-filled <b>overvoltage</b> <b>protectors.</b> The EMP from the 22 October (K-3) nuclear test caused all of the fuses to blow and all of the <b>overvoltage</b> <b>protectors</b> to fire in all of the sub-lines of the 570 km telephone line. The EMP from the same test caused the destruction of the Karaganda power plant, and shut down 1000 km of shallow-buried power cables between Astana (then called Aqmola) and Almaty.|$|R
