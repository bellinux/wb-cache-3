5|$|The <b>overall</b> <b>impression</b> {{of space}} within the cockpit {{area and the}} great degree of visual {{sighting}} afforded by the Plexiglas panelling were regarded as positive factors, with one important provision in relation to weather conditions. Should either bright sunshine or rainstorms be encountered, the pilot's visibility could be dangerously compromised either by glare throwback or lack of good sighting.|$|E
5|$|The western slopes fall {{smoothly}} to {{the head}} of Thirlmere reservoir, and the tiny church at Wythburn. There are rougher areas, High and Comb Crags in particular, but these do little to change the <b>overall</b> <b>impression</b> of high moorland. The lower slopes have been planted with conifers as part of the Thirlmere Forest, but above this is a sense of wide open space. Nethermost Pike's toehold on the valley is shifted a little to the south, relative to its position on the ridge. This is because Whelpside and Birkside Gills, its boundary streams, both run south-west, rather than flowing straight down the slope.|$|E
5|$|In the 1330s, {{when the}} architects of Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture {{moved away from the}} Flowing Decorated in an entirely different and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly modular form, of the choir of the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved forms for effect, gives an <b>overall</b> <b>impression</b> of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above. The style proved very adaptable and continued with variations in the naves of Canterbury and Winchester, and in the choir of York.|$|E

5|$|Voting {{during the}} three shows {{consisted}} of 50 percent public televoting and 50 percent from a jury deliberation. The jury consisted of five music industry professionals who were citizens of the country they represent, with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency. This jury was asked to judge each contestant based on vocal capacity, the stage performance, the song's composition and originality, and the <b>overall</b> <b>impression</b> of the act. In addition, no member of a national jury could be related {{in any way to}} any of the competing acts {{in such a way that}} they could not vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member were released shortly after the grand final.|$|E

The {{purpose of the study}} is to research how teacher-raters respond, interpret and use rubrics in assessing EFL students’ short descriptive writing, and to what degree it impacts students’ grades. Through this study, I hope to determine whether teacher-raters work toward being true to a given rubric, or whether their ratings are still based on <b>overall</b> <b>impressions.</b>|$|R
25|$|The cloisters of {{the cathedral}} were built between 1317 and 1340 in Gothic style, and again shows the {{influence}} of the cloisters of Lisbon Cathedral.

25|$|The {{practice}} of surface variation {{as a means}} of illusionism--"kenlijkheyt", or perceptibility--was understood by some of Rembrandt's contemporaries. Even so, the dramatic differences between the paint application in the face and passages of the drapery and background are unusual for a late self-portrait. The <b>overall</b> <b>impression</b> is that of a complete work, one that presents the subject as marked by experience yet ultimately resolute in dignity.|$|E
25|$|In 2011 some {{detected}} a pre-Raphaelite {{line to the}} Alexander McQueen dress, designed by Sarah Burton, for Catherine Middleton's wedding to Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, Middleton's somewhat medieval headdress called to mind images from paintings by such later pre-Raphaelites as John Waterhouse and Edward Burne-Jones, the <b>overall</b> <b>impression</b> being especially apparent in a side-on double page photograph of the couple by Max Mumby {{on the cover of}} the following day's edition of the London Times.|$|E

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that negative information has a stronger influence on <b>overall</b> <b>impressions</b> than does positive information of equal intensity. Recent attempts to explain this phenomenon with evolutionary arguments show strong potential for predicting how and when the effect will be manifested. This paper tests information processing implications of one evolutionary perspective (Peeters and Czapinski 1990), finding general support. In particular, empirical evidence indicates that processing of negative information is relatively more objective and integrative whereas processing of positive information is relatively more subjective and less integrative in focus...|$|R
25|$|Very roughly, earlier printings {{are valued}} more than later. In particular, the first edition, with its very {{different}} account of Riddles in the Dark, is in great demand. However, the fifth <b>overall</b> <b>impression,</b> {{or the first}} printing of the second edition, seems to be garnering prices {{as high as the}} British fourth printing, which was the cheapest and most common of the first edition printings. Later second edition printings are valued much less than first edition printings or the first printing of the second edition.|$|E
25|$|The {{buildings}} are relatively soberly designed with few distinct details; the <b>overall</b> <b>impression</b> is monumental. The interior, however, has gradually been changed {{and very little}} remains from the original interior. An exception is the auditorium in the central courtyard, which keeps its original interior with ceiling paintings, as well as stage and balcony with classical decoration. This building along with the administration building are listed blue (class I) – as buildings of most historical importance. The remaining original {{buildings are}} listed green (class II) – important in a culture-historical perspective.|$|E
25|$|Most single-breasted suits {{have two}} or three buttons, and one or four buttons are unusual (except that dinner jackets ("black tie") often have only one button). It is rare to find a suit with more than four buttons, {{although}} zoot suits can have as many as six or more due to their longer length. There is also variation in the placement and style of buttons, since the button placement is critical to the <b>overall</b> <b>impression</b> of height conveyed by the jacket. The centre or top button will typically line up quite closely with the natural waistline. There seems to be no clear rule as to which side the overlap should lie. It usually crosses naturally with the left side to the fore but not invariably. Generally, a hidden button holds the underlap in place.|$|E

The findings reveal high marks for the conference space, hotel rooms, and the city of Boston itself, resulting in an overall positive conference experience, but responses also highlight several areas of concern, including panelist attendance problems and presentation etiquette.

We surveyed 360 Belgian redundant employees (i. e., clients) using outplacement services provided by a public employment agency. The results indicate that an outplacement experience perceived as adequate for clients fosters their <b>overall</b> <b>impressions</b> of justice towards the dismissing organization; this leads in turn to benefits for them: reduction of negative emotions, enhancement of their perceived well-being, future perspectives, and job-seeking activities - confirming the mediating role of overall justice.

25|$|I find it {{amazing that}} he wrote this in the time period he did. It's very prophetic, {{it seems to be}} in line with a more modern {{understanding}} of Jesus that readers of The Course in Miracles and Marianne Williamson are a large part of vocalizing. But even fundamentalists would enjoy this book… being how it is written from the opinion of 80 different points of view, many of which do proclaim him the Son of God. Ultimately, any view can be thoughtfully stimulating because the people of any opinion have personalities and background given that support why they view Jesus with their perspective. The <b>overall</b> <b>impression</b> I received from this beautiful prose is the beauty and message of Jesus, the devotion, admiration, gratitude and love inspired by him, and the grace which he exuded with confident compassion. And whether he was God, man, a combination of both that we all are potentially, or a combination we can only idolize with an envious self-debasing distorted form of humility, this book shows him to be nothing less than relevant to our comprehension.|$|E

This study aims to examine the effects of emotional labour (surface acting and deep acting), perceived organisational support (POS) and perceived supervisor support (PSS) on tour guides’ role performance and to investigate correlations between variables. The results show that deep acting, POS and PSS are positively related to role performance while surface acting is negatively related to role performance. Moreover, surface acting, deep acting and supervisor concern and care predict tour guides’ role performance...|$|R
30|$|Most {{experimental}} studies shared {{the opinion that}} a short-term exposure to AFVs improves the respondents’ <b>overall</b> <b>impressions,</b> especially {{with respect to their}} environmental benefits. But once experience with AFVs is gained, environmental benefits become of minor importance as other vehicle features (e.g., driving range) will enter the decision set. Nevertheless, some studies stipulate that acquired experience with AFVs attract so-called “hybrid households”, because of their new qualities (e.g., quite ride, low running costs, home recharging) which can more than offset the disutility of a reduced range. Again, these studies also recognise that environmental concern is not an important attribute in the car purchase decision, even for early AFV buyers.|$|R
