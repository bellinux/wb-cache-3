5|$|Akihiro Kitamura as Katsuro, a Japanese tourist {{and front}} {{section of the}} centipede. Having already acted in <b>or</b> <b>written</b> {{for a number of}} films and {{television}} shows (including popular American television series Heroes), Kitamura was a relatively experienced actor compared to other cast members. He auditioned for the role of Katsuro via Skype from Los Angeles after the casting director saw him on television and recommended him for the role. The rest of the cast did not meet Kitamura until the day before shooting commenced.|$|E
5|$|Along these lines, some {{academics}} {{link the}} Gawain pentangle to magical traditions. In Germany, the symbol {{was called a}} Drudenfuß and was placed on household objects to keep out evil. The symbol was also associated with magical charms that, if recited <b>or</b> <b>written</b> on a weapon, would call forth magical forces. However, concrete evidence tying the magical pentagram to Gawain's pentangle is scarce.|$|E

5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication (AAC) is an umbrella term that encompasses the communication {{methods used to}} supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken <b>or</b> <b>written</b> language. AAC is used by those {{with a wide range}} of speech and language impairments, including congenital impairments such as cerebral palsy, intellectual impairment and autism, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. AAC can be a permanent addition to a person's communication or a temporary aid.|$|E

She claimed that every word attributed to Wellington in An Infamous Army was actually spoken <b>or</b> <b>written</b> by him in real life. Her knowledge of the period was so extensive that Heyer rarely mentioned dates explicitly in her books; instead, she situated the story by casually referring to major and minor events of the time.|$|E

5|$|Administered by the International Baccalaureate (IB), the IBDP {{is taught}} in schools in over 140 countries, {{in one of three}} languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, {{students}} must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each subject group, and three core requirements. Students are evaluated using both internal and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. Internal assessment varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, <b>or</b> <b>written</b> work. In most cases, these are initially graded by the classroom teacher, whose grades are then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator.|$|E
5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken <b>or</b> <b>written</b> language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E

5|$|The Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) {{mainframe}} computer {{was built in}} the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory between 1946 and 6 May 1949, when it ran its first program, and remained in use until 11 July 1958. The EDSAC {{was one of the first}} stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from <b>or</b> <b>written</b> to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes (CRTs) to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human-computer interaction, Alexander S. Douglas, a doctoral candidate in mathematics at the university, used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game.|$|E
5|$|The electors {{were then}} told {{to break up}} the Convention and {{assemble}} into the formal Assembly or Council. The electors voted by placing a pebble <b>or</b> <b>written</b> ballot into an appropriate jar. The baskets that held the votes were watched by specific officers, who then counted the ballots, and reported the results to the presiding magistrate. The majority of votes in any Curia, Tribe, or Century decided how that Curia, Tribe, or Century voted. Each Curia, Tribe, or Century received one vote, regardless of how many electors each Tribe or Century held. Once a majority of Curiae, Tribes, or Centuries voted in the same way on a given measure, the voting ended, and the matter was decided.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{internal}} assessment (IA) varies by subject. There may be oral presentations (used in languages), practical work (in experimental sciences and performing arts), <b>or</b> <b>written</b> work. Internal assessment accounts for 20 to 50 percent of the mark awarded for each subject and {{is marked by a}} teacher in the school. A sample of at least five per subject at each level from a school will also be graded by a moderator appointed by the IB, in a process called external moderation of internal assessment. Based on this moderation, the grades of the whole subject from that school will change.|$|E

5|$|When {{described}} as a system of symbolic communication, language is traditionally seen as consisting of three parts: signs, meanings, and a code connecting signs with their meanings. The study {{of the process of}} semiosis, how signs and meanings are combined, used, and interpreted is called semiotics. Signs can be composed of sounds, gestures, letters, or symbols, depending on whether the language is spoken, signed, <b>or</b> <b>written,</b> and they can be combined into complex signs, such as words and phrases. When used in communication, a sign is encoded and transmitted by a sender through a channel to a receiver who decodes it.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive deficits {{that can}} follow TBI include {{impaired}} attention; disrupted insight, judgement, and thought; reduced processing speed; distractibility; and deficits in executive {{functions such as}} abstract reasoning, planning, problem-solving, and multitasking. Memory loss, the most common cognitive impairment among head-injured people, occurs in 20–79% of people with closed head trauma, depending on severity. People who have suffered TBI may also have difficulty with understanding or producing spoken <b>or</b> <b>written</b> language, or with more subtle aspects of communication such as body language. Post-concussion syndrome, a set of lasting symptoms experienced after mild TBI, can include physical, cognitive, emotional and behavioral problems such as headaches, dizziness, difficulty concentrating, and depression. Multiple TBIs may have a cumulative effect. A young person who receives a second concussion before symptoms from another one have healed {{may be at risk}} for developing a very rare but deadly condition called second-impact syndrome, in which the brain swells catastrophically after even a mild blow, with debilitating or deadly results. About one in five career boxers is affected by chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI), which causes cognitive, behavioral, and physical impairments. Dementia pugilistica, the severe form of CTBI, affects primarily career boxers years after a boxing career. It commonly manifests as dementia, memory problems, and parkinsonism (tremors and lack of coordination).|$|E
5|$|In 1952, Alexander S. Douglas created OXO, a {{software}} program for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of tic-tac-toe. The EDSAC {{was one of the}} first stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from <b>or</b> <b>written</b> to, and filled an entire room; it included three 35×16 dot matrix cathode ray tubes to graphically display the state of the computer's memory. As a part of a thesis on human–computer interaction, Douglas used one of these screens to portray other information to the user; he chose to do so via displaying the current state of a game. The player entered input using a rotary telephone controller, selecting which of the nine squares on the board they wished to move next. Their move would appear on the screen, and then the computer's move would follow. The game was not available to the general public, and was only available to be played in the University of Cambridge's Mathematical Laboratory, by special permission, as the EDSAC could not be moved. Like other early video games, after serving Douglas's purpose, the game was discarded. Around the same time, Strachey expanded his draughts program for another mainframe computer, the Manchester Mark 1, culminating in a version for the Ferranti Mark 1 in 1952, which had a CRT display. Like OXO, the display was mostly static, updating only when a move was made. OXO and Strachey's draughts program are the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen.|$|E

5|$|OXO or Noughts and Crosses is a {{video game}} {{developed}} by A S Douglas in 1952 for the Electronic Delay Storage Automatic Calculator (EDSAC) computer, which simulates a game of noughts and crosses. It {{was one of the}} first games developed in the early history of video games. Douglas programmed the game as part of a thesis on human-computer interaction for the University of Cambridge. The EDSAC {{was one of the first}} stored-program computers, with memory that could be read from <b>or</b> <b>written</b> to, and had three small cathode ray tube screens to display the state of the memory; Douglas re-purposed one screen to demonstrate portraying other information to the user, such as the state of a noughts and crosses game. After the game served its purpose, it was discarded on the original hardware but later successfully reconstructed. OXO, along with a draughts game by Christopher Strachey completed around the same time, is one of the earliest known games to display visuals on an electronic screen. Under some definitions, it thus may qualify as the first video game, though other definitions exclude it due to its lack of moving or real-time updating graphics.|$|E
5|$|The recipes {{were often}} brief {{and did not}} give precise quantities. Cooking times and {{temperatures}} were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done with fire. At best, cooking times could be specified as {{the time it took}} to say a certain number of prayers or how long it took to walk around a certain field. Professional cooks were taught their trade through apprenticeship and practical training, working their way up in the highly defined kitchen hierarchy. A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal without the help of recipes <b>or</b> <b>written</b> instruction. Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historian Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household, such as the Ménagier de Paris from the late 14th century. Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today, written in several major European languages.|$|E
