The <b>OM</b> <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> used was the evaporative gravimetric method used with volatile food simulants. Thirty (30) food contact substances (additives and monomers) were tested for their chemical stability and volatile loss during the heated evaporation stage of the OM procedure. 18 of the 30 were determined in acceptable yield. It is concluded that in the list of ca. 620 EU substances that have specific migration limit values of 5 mg/kg or higher, and based on considerations of stability and volatility, more than half could be amenable to control using OM methodology. This is particularly the case for inert plastics with low intrinsic overall migration values of oligomers. This means that, based on the OM test result found, testing laboratories could decide case-by-case if known additives and starting substances are covered by the OM result and no separate testing would be required for specific migration, with time and resource cost savings...|$|E

Three interesting and intuitively appealing motivations, {{in favor of the}} proposed <b>test</b> <b>procedure,</b> are given. Asymptotic, normality of the proposed test statistic is derived under the null hypothesis and under a large class of fixed alternatives. The proposed <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> is shown to be consistent against a large class of alternatives. For a sequence of local alternatives, which, converges to the null hypothesis at the rate of n(- 1 / 4), the proposed <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> is compared with three existing <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> (i. e. the Greenwood-type <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> proposed in (4), which is known to be locally most powerful among all <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> based symmetrically on spacings, a procedure due to (5) and a procedure due to (3)), in terms of the Pitman asymptotic relative efficiency. It is observed that the proposed <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> has larger efficacies than <b>test</b> <b>procedures</b> proposed by (5) and (3), and has efficacies comparable to the Greenwood-type <b>test</b> <b>procedure.</b> Using Monte Carlo simulations, we simulate finite sample critical points and power results against seven alternatives.

40|$|Consider {{the problem}} of testing s null {{hypotheses}} simultaneously. In {{order to deal with}} the multiplicity problem, the classical approach is to restrict attention to multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedures</b> that control the familywise error rate (FWE). The closure method of Marcus et al. (1976) reduces {{the problem of}} constructing such procedures to one of constructing single tests that control the usual probability of a Type 1 error. It was shown by Sonnemann (1982, 2008) that any coherent multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> can be constructed using the closure method. Moreover, it was shown by Sonnemann and Finner (1988) that any incoherent multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> can be replaced by a coherent multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> which is at least as good. In this paper, we first show an analogous result for dissonant and consonant multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedures.</b> We show further that, in many cases, the improvement of the consonant multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> over the dissonant multiple <b>testing</b> <b>procedure</b> may in fact be strict {{in the sense that it}} has strictly greater probability of detecting a false null hypothesis while still maintaining control of the FWE.

40|$|Residential {{two-stage}} gas furnaces {{account for}} {{almost a quarter of}} the total number of models listed in the March 2005 GAMA directory of equipment certified for sale in the United States. Two-stage furnaces are expanding their presence in the market mostly because they meet consumer expectations for improved comfort. Currently, the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> serves as the method for reporting furnace total fuel and electricity consumption under laboratory conditions. In 2006, American Society of Heating Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) proposed an update to its <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> which corrects some of the discrepancies found in the DOE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and provides an improved methodology for calculating the energy consumption of two-stage furnaces. The objectives of this paper are to explore the differences in the methods for calculating two-stage residential gas furnace energy consumption in the DOE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and in the 2006 ASHRAE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> and to compare test results to research results from field tests. Overall, the DOE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> shows a reduction in the total site energy consumption of about 3 percent for two-stage compared to single-stage furnaces at the same efficiency level. In contrast, the 2006 ASHRAE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> shows almost no difference in the total site energy consumption. The 2006 ASHRAE <b>test</b> <b>procedure</b> appears to provide a better methodology for calculating the energy consumption of two-stage furnaces.
