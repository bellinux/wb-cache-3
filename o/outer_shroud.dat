5000|$|A Vickers-type booster (the [...] "typical" [...] muzzle booster type) {{consists}} of two parts; {{the first is a}} flared [...] "cup" [...] on the muzzle of the barrel and the second is a perforated tube around the end of the muzzle, attached to {{the main body of the}} weapon, and with an end closed except for a small hole for the bullet to pass through. As the bullet exits the barrel, the expanding gases follow it into the chamber created between the cup and the shroud. As it passes through the close tolerance hole in the end of the perforated tube, it temporarily forms a blockage to further forward movement of the expanding gas from the barrel. The pressure inside the booster rises very rapidly as the gases continue to expand in the confined space (even after the bullet has cleared the hole, the gas pressure is still very high). The cup on the muzzle of the barrel provides a large, movable surface for the gas to push against, as it exerts force equally in all directions. As the <b>outer</b> <b>shroud</b> is fixed to the main frame of the gun, and only the barrel is movable, the pressure forces the cup and barrel to the rear, acting exactly as a piston in a cylinder. As the barrel cycles to the rear, the cup passes the perforations in the <b>outer</b> <b>shroud,</b> opening an escape path for the gases, immediately lowering the pressure, both reducing the harsh impact when the barrel reaches full recoil and preventing the remaining pressure from the gases from acting as a [...] "spring" [...] and slowing the barrel when it begins to travel forwards again (which would only slow the rate of fire). The barrel continues to the rear on its own momentum, and actuates the operating mechanism. The resulting action can be seen as a composite of the recoil action and a gas action — the barrel being acted upon as if it were the piston. Muzzle boosters in other weapons act in a similar fashion.|$|E

This new design of turbine consisted of bowed stator and rotor blades to study the effect on reduction of secondary ow losses and thus improvement in turbine efficiency if any. The new design also incorporated labyrinth seals on both inner and <b>outer</b> <b>shrouds.</b> Extensive Inter-stage and Performance experiments were carried out on this new turbine. Inter-stage measurements were accomplished by traversing three 5 -hole probes radially and circumferentially, using the existing probe traverse system in TPFL. Performance tests were conducted for varying pressure ratio, at fixed rotational speed and for varying rotational speed with fixed pressure ratio and the efficiency was plotted against u/c_ 0. Each condition was tested and measured two to three times to check for reproducibility of the data. The results from inter-stage experiments show that the rotor row loss coefficient is about four times higher than the stator row loss coefficient. This high rotor loss coefficient reduces the total to static efficiency. From the performance tests, the maximum total-to-static efficiency observed was 85. 2 percent located at around u/c_ 0 = 0. 75.

In this paper, a novel high multi-stage pressure reducing valve (HMSPRV) is proposed, which can be used for hydrogen stable decompression in hydrogen refueling station. In HMSPRV, the inner and <b>outer</b> porous <b>shrouded</b> valve core is used to replace piston valve core to achieve the first-stage throttling, and the porous orifice plate is chosen as the second-stage throttling component. Meanwhile, in order to verify the applicability of HMSPRV, the flow characteristics of two fluids are studied. Firstly, the choked flow, flow and temperature characteristics of superheated steam under different valve openings are carried out. Secondly, the flow characteristic of hydrogen is also conducted to validate the application of HMSPRV in hydrogen refueling station. The results show that, for superheated steam flow, with the increasing of valve openings, the maximum gradient of fluid pressure moves from the fitting surface where inner and <b>outer</b> porous <b>shrouded</b> to the orifice plate. The regulation of its amount is decreasing first and then increasing. With the increasing of valve openings, the maximum velocity, turbulent dissipation rate and pressure loss are all increasing gradually, while the temperature does not change significantly. For hydrogen flow, both the pressure changing process and velocity changing process are similar to superheated steam. It can be concluded that HMSPRV has good flow and temperature characteristics in complex conditions, and it does not prone to choked flow. Throttling effect of the multi-stage pressure reducing way is obvious. This work can benefit the further research work on hydrogen stable decompression in hydrogen refueling station...|$|R

40|$|During {{a typical}} startup cycle {{industrial}} gas turbine blades experience rapid radial thermal expansion while bulky shroud structure with larger thermal inertia requires much longer period {{to reach its}} operating temperature. Turbine designers have to leave a safe radial distance {{in order to prevent}} contact of blades to the surrounding annular casing. However, when thermal steady state in the turbine stage is achieved, shroud and casing grow and excessive amount of blade-shroud clearance remains. Engine efficiency is very sensitive to blade-shroud clearance. Just one millimeter of radial blade tip gap in fist stage turbine section of a 150 MW class engine leads to 4 % efficiency drop due to blade tip leakage. To achieve better efficiency or higher power, turbine blade tip clearance has to be controlled. Attempts to address blade tip clearance problem were not applicable as designs were bulky and complex which required excessive modification on the turbine hardware and design. The goal {{of this study is to}} design, analyze and develop a low-cost and compact actuator system which is capable of controlling the tip clearance up to 0. 25 mm at elevated temperatures. Actuator will be positioned between inner and <b>outer</b> <b>shrouds</b> of the casing to force the inner shroud radially away from the blades during transients, and allow it to come back towards the blades when casing reaches operating temperature to decrease the tip leakage during steady state. Different actuator designs have been studied and finite element analysis solutions have been obtained for deflection and stress. Low cycle fatigue life of the actuator has been estimated via Coffin-Manson criterion. An experimental setup has been designed and fabricated to validate the simulation results. Furthermore, since actuator will be subjected to wear at elevated temperatures due to mechanical loading and vibrations in the gas turbine, friction and wear behavior of candidate actuator materials has to be investigated. High temperature scuffing combined with rapid oxidation can lead to failures and dramatic reductions service life. Therefore, another experimental setup has been developed to conduct friction and wear tests of the candidate actuator materials, i. e. Nickel and Cobalt based superalloys Haynes 25, 188 and 214. The tests have been conducted at 20, 200, 400 and 540 °C.

An apparent independence of burnout heat flux from inlet pressure was observed for the rod cluster at a very small value of mass velocity (50 kg m- 2 s- 1). At a high mass velocity (4 Mg m- 2 s- 1), the internally heated annulus had a significantly greater burnout heat flux than the corresponding externally heated one.

The {{development}} of HDDs goes toward higher data densities and increased rotation speeds with a continuously growing demand for larger storage capacity and faster data access speed. On the other hand, the next generation of HDDs is expected to be smaller in size and to consume less energy. The distance between the read-and-write head and the disk surface reaches into the range of 10 nm for recently developed HDDs. The disk rotation entrains the surrounding air and lets three-dimensional complex flow structures develop in a HDD. The complex flow induces disk vibrations, which may lead irreparable damage to the disks. Many investigations have been reported on the disk vibrations or/and on the flow structures in a HDD, but the detailed mechanism of the flow-disk interaction remains still yet to be understood. The air flow in a HDD can be roughly divided into three different regions: inner, <b>outer</b> and <b>shroud</b> regions [1] as depicted in Fig. 1.

40|$|Cryogenic shrouds {{have been}} {{designed}} and built for use in thermomechanical testing of samples of thermalinsulation panels on cryogenic vessels. In the original application for which these shrouds were specifically designed, the samples {{are representative of the}} large-area thermal-insulation panels on the space-shuttle external tanks that hold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, and the purpose of the testing is to demonstrate the ability of bonded layers in the panels to resist delamination under a combination of applied uniaxial mechanical loads and realistic operational temperatures. Presumably, the shrouds and the tests performed by use of them could be modified to enable similar evaluation of thermomechanical properties of thermal-insulation panels for cryogenic vessels other than the external tanks of the space shuttles. The shrouds are required to enable maintenance of required temperatures on the inner and outer surfaces of the thermal-insulation-panel samples, to enable visual observation of the outer surfaces of the samples, and not to introduce any measurable loads into the panels. For each panel sample, there are two shrouds: one to be mounted on the inner surface (the surface that would be in contact with a tank containing a cryogenic liquid during normal use) and one to be mounted on the outer surface (the surface that would be exposed to ambient air or other warmer environment during normal use). The shrouds for testing specimens of thermal-insulation- panels for the liquid-hydrogen tank are made largely of titanium; the shrouds for testing specimens of thermal- insulation-panels for the liquid-oxygen tank are made largely of an aluminum- lithium alloy. The specific temperature requirements are the following: The inner shroud must make it possible to maintain a temperature of 321 degrees F (196 degrees C) [the approximate temperature of liquid nitrogen] or 453 F (about 269 C) [the approximate temperature of liquid helium] on the inner face of the sample. The <b>outer</b> <b>shroud</b> must make it possible to maintain a temperature between 30 degrees and 0 degrees F (between about 34 degrees and about 18 degrees C) on the outer surface of the sample by blowing a cryogenic gas or missile grade air along that surface. To enable viewing of the outer surface of the sample during testing, the <b>outer</b> <b>shroud</b> includes a window comprising two layers of poly(methyl methacrylate) with a gap between them to reduce fogging. To ensure that the shrouds do not introduce any measurable loads into a panel specimen, the shrouds are cushioned on the specimen by seals made of a fluoropolymer-membrane/fabric composite material and are held in place on the specimen by means of symmetrically placed clamps with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) pads.

One of the subscale model test programs for the integrated mixer/ejector development was a joint test conducted by the NASA Lewis Research Center and Pratt & Whitney Aircraft. This test was conducted to study various mixer/ejector nozzle configurations installed on the core flow exhaust of advanced, high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines for subsonic, commercial applications. The mixer/ejector concept involves the introduction of largescale, low-loss, streamwise vortices that entrain large amounts of secondary air and rapidly mix it with the primary stream. This results in increased ejector pumping relative to conventional ejectors and in more complete mixing within the ejector shroud. The latter improves thrust performance through the efficient energy exchange between the primary and secondary streams. This experimental program was completed in April 1997 in Lewis' CE- 22 static test facility. Variables tested included the nozzle area ratio (A 9 /A 8), which ranged from 1. 6 to 3. 0. This ratio was varied by increasing or decreasing the nozzle throat area, A 8. Primary nozzles tested included both lobed mixers and conical primaries. These configurations were tested with and without an <b>outer</b> <b>shroud,</b> and the shroud position was varied by inserting spacers in it. In addition, data were acquired with and without secondary flow...|$|E
40|$|In a {{gas turbine}} engine, {{ingestion}} of hot {{gas from the}} flowpath into the gaps between the turbine rotor and stator can lead to elevated metal temperatures and a deterioration of component life. To prevent ingestion, bleed air from the compressor is used to "purge" the rim seal cavities. Establishing a quantitative understanding of the wheelspace and rim cavity flow processes driving ingestion is critical to optimizing seal design and minimizing the associated performance penalty. A computational model of the wheelspace that does not limit the spatial or temporal scales of flow processes is formulated. This allows {{the assessment of the}} response of the wheelspace to external stimuli set up by the turbine main flow path, and the development of causal links between flow processes and their drivers. Varying the axisymmetric turbine flowpath pressure on a quasi-steady basis when the purge flow supply seal is choked has no impact on ingestion; the pressure field in the wheelspace merely scales with the flowpath pressure, leaving the flow structure unchanged. Introducing circumferential variation in the external pressure field can, however, lead to ingestion with the ratio of disturbance wavelength to the trench depth emerging as a key parameter. Varying rotational speed alone does not drive ingestion as a stagnation point is formed on the <b>outer</b> <b>shroud</b> that is ingestion resistant. It is shown that excitation at frequencies corresponding to the natural modes of the wheelspace system can lead to large responses in pressure and seal flow rate, with the seal reduced frequency appearing as a characterizing parameter. The existence and parametric dependence of these modes is further assessed through a small disturbance flow analysis. A generalized small disturbance flow analysis is formulated that provides a direct enumeration of the key characterizing parameters. by Peter T. Catalfamo. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|This {{paper is}} objected {{to bring out}} an {{unbiased}} and detailed hydraulic response study in pumps as turbines due to blade rounding, inner and <b>outer</b> <b>shroud</b> rounding of the impeller inlet through high quality measurements of macroscopic parameters. To begin with a theoretical model is proposed where the hydraulic losses are categorized as flow zone and no-flow zone types, while suitable assumptions are made to the shaft and runner (Euler) torque. Four centrifugal pumps having specific speed {{in the range of}} 19 - 54 rpm are selected for this 3 -stage impeller rounding investigation. All pumps had backward vane impeller designs. The blade rounding showed greater reduction of flow zone losses compared to increase of runner torque resulting in an efficiency rise of 1 - 1. 5 %, while inner shrouds have shown evidence of decrease in losses but an inconsistent behavior of runner torque gains. The final rounding stage at the outer shrouds displayed traces of proof of non-flow zone hydraulic optimization. The consolidated rounding effects were compared to results of other researchers which again showed concurrence and consistency. The paper evokes a sentiment that the technique of fixed geometry optimizations of backward vane impeller has been saturated given that the maximum efficiency rise is only in the range of 1 - 2. 5 %., even though the total hydraulic losses constitute 25 - 30 % of the total energy (head) since the achieved best efficiency after modification ranges between 65 % and 75 %. Therefore, the paper recommends a calibrated methodology to change the backward vane angle so that the inlet relative velocity aligns with the blade and the strong wakes are reduced, which could reduce losses by 5 - 10 %. To conclude the paper pragmatically looks towards the limited scale of PAT application compared to pumping and proposes the study of rounding effects on pump operation {{to see if there is}} any positive alleviation of performance, which could have a greater benefit to industry and society.

This thesis {{is concerned with the}} development of a theoretical method for predicting the turbulent flow and heat transfer in the cavity between a rotating and a stationary cone. The motivation for the work stems from the need, in the design process for the gas turbine aero-engine, for a fast and reliable predictive method for such flows. The method developed here is the integral method, which reduces the governing partial differential equations to ordinary differential equations. A number of solution methods for these equations are described, and the optimum in terms of speed and accuracy is indicated. Predicted moment coefficients compare well with experimental data. For half-cone angles greater than approximately 60 ° but poorly for half cone angle less than approximately 45 °. The poor agreement for small cone angles is thought to be due to the presence of Taylor-type vortices, which cannot be incorporated into the integral method. Heat transfer is incorporated into the method using the Reynolds analogy. Due to the lack of experimental data, heat transfer predictions are compared with those from a finite difference program and show encouraging agreement. A computer program which solves the full Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes and energy equations in steady and axisymmetric form, using a finite-difference method is modified for use in the conical geometry. Comparison of the predicted moment coefficients with experimental data shows no marked improvement over the integral method. Examination of the secondary flow predicted by the program shows it to be {{similar to that of the}} integral method. The failure of the program to predict Taylor-type vortices may be attributed to the fact that they are non-axisymmetric and/or unsteady. The assumptions underlying the Integral method are investigated via the finite difference program and it is concluded that they are valid for half cone angles as small as 15 °. Based on the results of the finite difference program, the Integral method is modified to allow for a rectangular <b>outer</b> <b>shroud,</b> and a new model for the stator is described. It is concluded that both the integral method and the finite difference program can be used safely in rotor-stator systems where the half cone angle is greater than about 60 °. Rolls-Royce pl...|$|E
