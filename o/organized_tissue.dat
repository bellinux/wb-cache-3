5|$|Insect wing {{muscle is}} a {{strictly}} aerobic tissue. Per unit protein it consumes fuel and oxygen at rates {{taking place in}} a very concentrated and highly <b>organized</b> <b>tissue</b> so that the steady-state rates per unit volume represent an absolute record in biology. The fuel and oxygen rich blood is carried to the muscles through diffusion occurring in large amounts, {{in order to maintain}} the high level of energy used during flight. Many wing muscles are large and may be as large as 10mm in length and 2mm in width. Moreover, in some Diptera the fibres are of giant dimensions. For instance, in the very active Rutilia, the cross-section is 1800µm long and more than 500µm wide. The transport of fuel and oxygen from the surroundings to the sites of consumption and the reverse transport of carbon dioxide therefore represent a challenge to the biologist both in relation to transport in the liquid phase and in the intricate system of air tubes, i.e. in the tracheal system.|$|E

50|$|Laminins are heterotrimeric {{proteins}} that contain an α-chain, a β-chain, and a γ-chain, found in five, four, and three genetic variants, respectively. The laminin molecules are named {{according to their}} chain composition. Thus, laminin-511 contains α5, β1, and γ1 chains. Fourteen other chain combinations {{have been identified in}} vivo. The trimeric proteins intersect to form a cross-like structure that can bind to other cell membrane and extracellular matrix molecules. The three shorter arms are particularly good at binding to other laminin molecules, which allows them to form sheets. The long arm is capable of binding to cells, which helps anchor <b>organized</b> <b>tissue</b> cells to the membrane.|$|E

40|$|Micro- and nanotextured {{biomaterial}} surfaces {{have been}} widely studied for their capacity to drive the regeneration of <b>organized</b> <b>tissues.</b> Nanotopographical features {{in the shape of}} grooveâ ridge patterns aim at mimicking the extracellular matrix organization. However, to date, a wide array of groove and ridge sizes has been described. In this work, we therefore tested a device composed of a multipatterned array consisting of six patterns of radially arranged parallel nanogrooves, with a pitch ranging from 0 to 1000 nm and a depth ranging from 0 to 170 nm, {{to be used as a}} tool for the expeditious and simultaneous screening of surface topographies aiming the regeneration of anisotropically <b>organized</b> <b>tissues</b> such as ligament. The topographies were reproduced in (1) epoxy resin or (2) membranes produced by the crosslinking of platelet lysate (PL) with genipin (gPL). Both materials were seeded with periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) and the proliferation, migration, as well as cell alignment were assessed. The effect of topography in PDLCs was only evident in terms of cell organization, resulting in a highly anisotropic organization of the cells for the 1000 and 600 nm patterns, and in an increased isotropic organization for shallower topographies. Overall, our results suggest that this multipatterned system can be a valuable diagnostic tool for biomaterials aiming at the regeneration of anisotropically <b>organized</b> <b>tissues,</b> such as periodontal ligament.

However, Brusca & Brusca (2003) discourage this usage, using mesoglea in its strict sense, and preferring to maintain both the embryological and zoological senses for the term mesenchyme.|$|E

40|$|Cancers {{are rarely}} caused by single mutations, but often develop {{as a result}} of the {{combined}} effects of multiple mutations. For most cells, the number of possible cell divisions is limited because of various biological constraints, such as progressive telomere shortening, cell senescence cascades or a hierarchically <b>organized</b> <b>tissue</b> structure. Thus, the risk of accumulating cells carrying multiple mutations is low. Nonetheless, many diseases are based on the accumulation of such multiple mutations. We model a general, hierarchically <b>organized</b> <b>tissue</b> by a multi-compartment approach, allowing any number of mutations within a cell.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Low-intensity pulsed {{ultrasound}} (LIPUS) {{has been}} shown to stimulate tissue metabolism and accelerate muscle healing. However, the optimal parameters in the use of LIPUS are still not clear. OBJECTIVE: The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the effects of LIPUS on muscle healing in rats subjected to a cryolesion. METHOD: Twenty rats were divided into the following groups: an injured control group (CG) and an injured treated group (TG). Both groups were divided into 2 sub-groups (n= 5 each) that were sacrificed 7 and 13 days post-surgery. Treatments were started 24 hours after the surgical procedure and consisted of 3 or 6 sessions. After euthanasia, the muscles were submitted to standard histological procedures. RESULTS: Qualitative analyses were based on morphological assessments of the muscle. The histopathological analysis on day 7 revealed that the muscles in the CG and the TG presented an intense inflammatory infiltrate, a large necrotic area and a disorganized tissue structure. After 13 days, both the CG and the TG had granulation tissue and newly formed fibers. The TG presented a more <b>organized</b> <b>tissue</b> structure. The quantitative analysis of collagen indicated similar findings among the groups, although the qualitative analysis revealed a better organization of collagen fibers in the TG at 13 days. The immunohistochemical analysis indicated that, at both time points, the expression of cyclooxygenase- 2 was upregulated in the TG compared to the CG. CONCLUSIONS: LIPUS used as a treatment for muscle injury induced a more <b>organized</b> <b>tissue</b> structure at the site of the injury and stimulated the expression of COX- 2 and the formation of new muscle fibers...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{formation}} of sharp borders, across which cell intermingling is restricted, has {{a crucial role}} in the establishment and maintenance of <b>organized</b> <b>tissues.</b> Signaling of Eph receptors and ephrins underlies {{formation of}} a number of boundaries between and within tissues during vertebrate development. Eph–ephrin signaling can regulate several types of cell response—adhesion, repulsion and tension—that can in principle underlie the segregation of cells and formation of sharp borders. Recent studies have implicated each of these cell responses as having important roles at different boundaries: repulsion at the mesoderm–ectoderm border, decreased adhesion at the notochord–presomitic mesoderm border, and tension at boundaries within the hindbrain and forebrain. These distinct responses to Eph receptor and ephrin activation may in part be due to the adhesive properties of the tissue...|$|R

A complex membrane organelle, the adherens junction, is thought to accomplish many of these functions. Molecular components of the adherens junction have begun to be identified (reviewed in Magee and Buxton, 1991).
