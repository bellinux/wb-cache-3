5|$|Briton was {{the first}} of the trio to be {{commissioned}} and was assigned to the East Indies Station in 1871. She remained there for four and a half years, mostly engaged on the suppression of the slave trade. The ship was refitted and rearmed upon her return home and Briton remained in reserve until recommissioned in 1881 for service <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Station. She was transferred back to the East Indies after two years <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape.</b> Her crew was relieved in 1884 by another sent out from Britain and the ship remained on station until she was sold, less her armament, in Bombay in 1887.|$|E
5|$|HMS Philomel, later HMNZS Philomel, was a Pearl-class cruiser. She was {{the fifth}} ship of that name and served with the Royal Navy. After her {{commissioning}} in 1890, she served <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> of Good Hope Station and later with the Mediterranean Fleet.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{other members}} of the royal family wear {{distinctive}} robes, most particularly queens consort (including dowagers) and princesses of the United Kingdom, all of whom wear purple velvet mantles edged with ermine over their court dresses. Other {{members of the royal family}} in attendance dress according to the conventions listed below, except that royal dukes wear a distinctive form of peer's robe, which has six rows of ermine <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>cape</b> and additional ermine on miniver edging to the front of the robe.|$|E
5|$|George Mack, ornithologist of the National Museum of Victoria, was {{the first}} to {{classify}} the three forms melanocephalus, cruentatus and pyrrhonotus as one species, although Richard Schodde reclassified pyrrhonotus as a hybrid from a broad hybrid zone in North Queensland; this area is bounded by the Burdekin, Endeavour and Norman Rivers. Breeding males of intermediate plumage, larger and scarlet-backed, or smaller and orange-backed, as well as forms that resemble one of the two parent subspecies, are all encountered within it. A molecular study published in 2008 focussing <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> York population found it was genetically closer to the eastern forest subspecies than to the Top End form. These birds became segregated around 0.27 million years ago, with some gene flow still with eastern birds.|$|E
5|$|Good Hope, {{named after}} the British colony <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> of Good Hope, was laid down on 11 September 1899 {{with the name of}} Africa by Fairfield Shipbuilding & Engineering at their Govan shipyard. She was renamed Good Hope on 2 October and {{launched}} on 21 February 1901. She arrived in Portsmouth to be completed and armed in late December 1901. In 1906 she became the flagship of the 1st Cruiser Squadron, Atlantic Fleet and was the flagship of the 2nd Cruiser Squadron when she visited South Africa two years later. Good Hope was placed in reserve in 1913.|$|E
50|$|Europeans, {{mostly from}} the nearby Burdekin farming community, began - {{in the early twentieth}} century - {{building}} semi-permanent huts <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape's</b> western foreshores. By the start of the twenty-first century these had mostly been replaced by permanent structures used mostly for recreational purposes, a small permanent population having also taken up residency by then.|$|R
50|$|These early farming {{groups had}} a {{relatively}} inclusive and progressive effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape's</b> conservative farming society. Sir Antonie was an MP in <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Parliament and, together with fellow MP James Molteno, he launched the first movement to give {{women of all}} races the right to vote, in 1907.

5|$|Historically, {{the spotted}} hyena was {{widespread}} throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. It {{is present in}} all habitats save for the most extreme desert conditions, tropical rainforests {{and the top of}} alpine mountains. Its current distribution is patchy in many places, especially in West Africa. Populations are concentrated in protected areas and surrounding land. There is a continuous distribution over large areas of Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Botswana, Namibia and the Transvaal Lowveld areas of South Africa. During the 1770s and 1780s the species was still widespread in southern and western South Africa, being recorded i.a. <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Peninsula and Cape Flats, and near present-day Somerset West, Riviersonderend, Mossel Bay, George, Joubertina, Gamtoos River, Jansenville, Cannon Rocks, Alice, Onseepkans and Augrabies Falls.|$|E
5|$|There were {{no further}} attacks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Colony during the war. The Treaty of Amiens in 1802 {{returned}} all captured Dutch colonies except Ceylon to the Batavian Republic, including the Cape Colony. The peace was short-lived, and {{early in the}} Napoleonic Wars a second British expeditionary force was prepared. In 1806 the British seized the Cape Colony a second time following the Battle of Blaauwberg. Cape Colony remained part of the British Empire until its independence {{as part of a}} unified South Africa in 1910.|$|E
5|$|A carnivore, the caracal {{typically}} preys upon small mammals, {{birds and}} rodents. Studies in South Africa {{have reported that}} it preys <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> grysbok, the common duiker, sheep, goats, bush vlei rats, rock hyraxes, hare and birds. A study in western India showed that rodents comprise {{a significant portion of}} the diet. They will feed from a variety of sources, but tend to focus on the most abundant one. Grasses and grapes are taken occasionally to clear their immune system and stomach of any parasites. Larger antelopes such as young kudu, bushbuck, impala, mountain reedbuck and springbok may also be targeted. Mammals generally comprise at least 80 percent of the diet. Lizards, snakes and insects are infrequently eaten. They are notorious for attacking livestock, but rarely attack humans.|$|E

5|$|Across {{northern}} Australia, Banksia dentata {{has been}} recorded as far west as the King Leopold Ranges in the western Kimberley through the Northern Territory and extending south to Katherine Gorge and into Queensland, where it is found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> York Peninsula to {{as far south as}} Cooktown. Off the coast, it {{has been recorded}} from Groote Eylandt and the Wessel Islands, as well as Melville and Bathurst Islands. It also extends onto the Aru Islands, where it is found around Trangan, and New Guinea, where it ranges in the south from Merauke east to Port Moresby, and around Bulolo and Mount Mau. It is the only Banksia species not endemic to Australia. As much of its range is in remote and poorly surveyed country, it is possible that it is found more widely than has been recorded. Pollen samples indicate it has been present on the Torres Strait Islands over the past 8000 years, though it has not been a prominent component of the island flora.|$|E
5|$|In North America {{and most}} of Europe, voles predominate in the diet and shrews are {{the second most common}} food choice. Mice and rats form the main {{foodstuffs}} in the Mediterranean region, the tropics, sub-tropics and Australia. Barn owls are usually more specialist feeders in productive areas and generalists in drier areas. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde Islands, geckos are the mainstay of the diet, supplemented by birds such as plovers, godwits, turnstones, weavers and pratincoles, and on a rocky islet off the coast of California, a clutch of four young were being reared on a diet of Leach's storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa). In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the bank vole in the 1950s led to a major shift in the barn owl's diet: where their ranges overlap, the vole is now by far the largest prey item. Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up the single largest proportion of prey. In the United States, rodents and other small mammals usually make up ninety-five percent of the diet and worldwide, over ninety percent of the prey caught.|$|E
5|$|On 31 March—just a {{fortnight}} {{after his arrival}} in Australia—MacArthur sent Casey and his air officer, Brigadier General Harold H. George to survey the situation in Port Moresby. They drew up plans to develop it into a base to support future operations. They recognised that to secure the area required work far beyond its environs. They called for the airfield at Horn Island to be upgraded, and new airfields to be constructed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> York Peninsula north of Townsville around Mareeba, Cooktown and Coen. This would allow ships to have fighter cover crossing the Torres Strait. To protect Port Moresby's eastern flank, GHQ decided to establish an airstrip in the Abau–Mullins Harbour area. Milne Bay was subsequently determined {{to be a better}} location, and a garrison was sent by sea from Port Moresby on 22 June. Another strip, at Merauke on the south coast of Dutch New Guinea, was authorised on 22 June to protect the western flank.|$|E

5|$|The area {{in which}} the Flanders family's beach house is located in is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Cape</b> Cod peninsula. Many of the writers of The Simpsons spent time on Cape Cod so they decided to model the new {{locations}} on it. The animators looked at Cape Cod photographs to get inspiration for the episode, and one of the show's background designers, Lance Wilder, grew up in that area. The beach house is based on then-show runner Josh Weinstein's parents' house in New Hampshire, to which the writers had visited many times. They played several board games when they were there, which gave them the idea to have to the Simpson family play the Mystery Date board game in the episode. Silverman said that the episode was difficult to animate and direct because it had so many new and detailed backgrounds and completely different locations.|$|E
