First, some level of household labour use diversification both within agriculture and into off-farm activities might be necessary, not only for income risk reduction, but also for significant increases in rural farm households’ income. Note that apart from the seasonal nature of agricultural production in Nigeria, {{the fact that most}} farm households operates small landholdings make <b>off-farm</b> <b>diversification</b> almost inevitable if full employment is to be guaranteed.|$|E

Diversification of income sources is stressed in the literature as an important strategy of enhancing the resilience of vulnerable communities and it “stands as the primary measure of household vulnerability and resilience (Tesso et al., 2012 p 884; Nguyen and James, 2013). Thus, given the benefits of diversification, households that diversify their income sources are likely to build their resilience to flood disasters in the future.|$|E

30|$|Income {{diversification}} {{has been}} hailed by some policy-makers {{as an important}} ingredient for building pastoral resilience. This study applied the sustainable livelihood approach to establish the determinants of diversification among pastoral households of Turkana and Mandera Counties. In these Counties, 300 and 362 households, respectively, were identified through multi-stage sampling. A participatory wealth-ranking method was used to categorize the sampled households into three poverty levels: poor, middle and rich. The number of income sources, distance to water source, education level of household head, Tropical livestock units (TLUs) held, durable index (a measure of physical asset ownership) and age of the household head influenced the choice of livelihood strategy, whether pastoral, agro-pastoral or <b>off-farm.</b> Although <b>diversification</b> among pastoral communities is on the increase, {{it is important to}} promote activities that complement pastoralism among communities of northern Kenya.

40|$|The study {{begins with}} a review of Green Revolution {{research}} in India. A move is charted from a concern with various types of differentiation to an interest in wage-rate trends and opportunities for <b>off-farm</b> <b>diversification.</b> This leads into {{a discussion of the}} crucial role of the investment patterns of richer farmers in governing the dynamics of rural industrialisation. Various characterisations of richer farmers are reviewed in this context. The focus then moves to Meerut District, western Uttar Pradesh. A review of the progress of the Green Revolution in this area is followed by a focus on the investment strategies of richer farmers in the district. The particular significance of notions of family is noted and related to social and political changes operating at a number of scales. It is argued, in conclusion, that the next generation of rural development or Green Revolution studies in India will require an attention to both 'old-fashioned' rural development issues centring on labour relations and distributive justice and a more novel set of social, cultural, and micropolitical questions relating to how successful farmers imagine their surplus and how its subsequent utilisation might be contested by less affluent groups. ...|$|E
30|$|Under the {{neoliberal}} paradigm, Mexican smallholders {{are portrayed as}} backward or inefficient and hence the rhetoric that Mexico needs a ‘modern’ agricultural sector (Toledo [1992]). Smallholders are often deemed as the ‘nonviable’ (Bebbington [1999]) and therefore the way forward for neoliberal planners is to intensify and modernize the agricultural sector. For example, in 1992, the Mexican government, arguing that rural smallholders lacked productivity, launched the counter-land reforms that {{opened the door for}} seizing ‘ejidos’ - smallholders’ community-owned land, which was about half of the agricultural land until 1991. This policy resulted from the negotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) (Schmidt and Gruben [1992]). Furthermore, public funds for the smallholder sector, in the form of subsidies and extension services, were withdrawn, and BANRURAL (a farmers’ bank) and CONASUPO (an institution to guarantee fair crop market prices) were dismantled. Under NAFTA, there has been an unprecedented growth of commercial food corporations with oligopolistic control of food commodities (Ochoa [2013]). This context for rural smallholders is further complicated by the unprecedented wave of violent crime often related to drug trafficking (Pereyra [2012]). And yet smallholders are still resisting this hostile context. On and <b>off-farm</b> <b>diversification</b> has been their main survival strategy in Latin American countries (Kay [2008]).|$|E
30|$|Cost of seed (COSEED) {{and income}} from rice {{production}} (RICINC) was positive and statistically significant {{only in the}} pooled data. This implies that {{as the price of}} seed and income from rice production increase, the farmers are motivated to participate more in the market. Similarly, the coefficient of house ownership (HOWN) — a measure of wealth —was also positive and statistically significant in the sub-population of the upland rice farming households. The coefficient of off-farm income (OFFINC) was also negative and statistically significant in the pooled data and sub-population of the upland and lowland rice farming households. Participating in any secondary occupation generally discourages households from participating in the market. Those who have income from off-farm activities generally do not have enough time to engage in the market activities. This implies that off-farm income has the tendency to initiate <b>off-farm</b> <b>diversification.</b> Jaleta et al. (2009) posited that ownership of livestock, which is usually one of the major sources of off-farm /non-arable income, negatively influence households’ participation in the crop market {{as a result of the}} possibility of distraction away from farming.

30|$|In Northwest Ethiopia, {{where the}} study was conducted, farm {{households}} simultaneously adopt agroforestry and non-farm income diversification activities.

This paper focuses on the barriers to taking up off-farm employment and establishing new non-agricultural enterprises. Factor and cluster analysis are applied to a data-set of individual farms in Poland {{in order to identify}} groups of households facing similar constraints and profile policy measures that are most likely to assist diversification. The majority of non-diversifiers are unlikely to become pluriactive in the near future due to a combination of age, a desire to concentrate on farming and remoteness. Farm households that are willing to diversify are characterised by the lowest agricultural incomes. For these households, a poor endowment of human and physical capital is a major constraint.

40|$|Although {{specialization}} is {{the global}} trend in agriculture, integrated farming systems {{have emerged in}} Vietnam. An important motive was the desire to improve the livelihoods and the diet of the nuclear families; this {{was evident in the}} analysis using the household life cycle of five phases. <b>Off-farm</b> <b>diversification</b> was especially important for a new household. At the onset of expansion, the new mothers replaced off-farm with homebound activities. During expansion the farmers increased virtual farm size by keeping more livestock; during accumulation, they invested in land or education, and during consolidation old couples adjusted farm activities to their labor capacity. Livestock, including fish, was essential for livelihood. The distribution of goats instead of cattle by credit or by "passing-on-the-gift " was far more effective for poverty alleviation. Technological innovations on the cultivation of rice and fruits, and the breeding of fish were essential for change. The improved food security and reduced cash income from rice after the 1986 reforms pushed farmers to take risks. The farm area and number of component farm activities providing cash determined the level of cash income from agriculture. Farms with at least four flows of biomass between components earned more, demonstrating that real integration improved profits. A minimum area of land in, or close to, the homestead, and know-how are required for an effective integration of components. Mekong Delta, agricultural diversification...|$|E
40|$|Special Issue: Works from "Future Leaders Global Workshop on Social Science of Agriculture, Food and Environment"This article {{studies the}} changes and {{diversification}} of family farming in Itasy region of Madagascar through {{the analysis of}} the class structure of this rural area. We are mainly interested in the Moderate Prosperity class and its formation process through the analysis of its members’ trajectories. Using detailed data from 508 households in the 2008 Itasy Observatory, we first identify the Moderate Prosperity groups by applying a clustering method based on four socioeconomic factors: household income, head of household’s education level, income structure and land tenure. Second, using a panel data from 2005 to 2008, we assess their trajectories by carrying out a sequence analysis. Third, we make a qualitative analysis of interviews conducted among 27 Moderate Prosperity households to explain these pathways. We identify four Moderate Prosperity groups reflecting three levels of accumulation potential. The Vulnerable Moderate Prosperity Households who adopt coping and defensive strategies have a diversified portfolio of on- and off- farm activities. The Emerging and Traditional Moderate Prosperity groups that are involved in adaptive strategies respectively rely on polyculture and rice farming. The Upper Moderate Prosperity households who clearly adopt accumulative strategies combine intensive farming with high-return non-farm activities or employment. The development of these livelihoods seems to result from a progressive integration into larger markets and different types of capital endowments. Findings show that changes in family farming in Itasy maintain strong rural roots, are developed around on- and <b>off-farm</b> <b>diversification,</b> and are still based on the family production unit...|$|E
40|$|Production of staples {{occupies}} {{an important}} part in Sub-Saharan Africa‘s crop production, and maize is its single most important food staple. This thesis mainly examines the role of maize in farmers‘ livelihoods and wellbeing in Tanzania, {{in the context of a}} long period of reforms that have affected both the maize market, agriculture more widely. It does so by exploring the role of maize in household‘s on and <b>off-farm</b> <b>diversification,</b> the determinants of crop productivity, and the relationship between diversification, commercialisation and‘ well-being. A number of specific issues are explored including the importance of factors such as farm size and education, access to key inputs such as seeds, fertilizers and agricultural extension services. The thesis uses data collected from three districts of Rukwa, one of Tanzania‘s major maize producing regions, and some secondary agricultural data from official sources. The research found that households with more land were generally more diversified (both on-farm and off-farm) than those with less land, and they experienced higher levels of well-being as measured by a range of concepts of well-being, but that maize continues to play an important role households‘ livelihoods and well-being. The research also revealed low levels of use of important agricultural inputs such as modern fertilizers and extension services, which may explain the low yields observed in the region. Education emerged as an important factor in raising yields, increasing commercialisation and also well-being, suggesting that nonagriculture policies may also be important for improving productivity and welfare of farmers. Despite the importance of crop production to their‘ well-being, households face several constraints; these include access to fertilizers, improved seeds and other chemical inputs necessary for higher production, and extension services. These findings have important policy implications as many rural households continue to rely on agriculture, especially production of staples. Therefore, these results could help the central and local governments to formulate strategies geared towards improving rural well-being...|$|E

The econometric methodology consists of deploying a multinomial logit model to track the distribution of OFA employment opportunities. Our results reveal that market forces, rather than overt political connections, are assuming increasing significance, especially for those operating own-account enterprises (OAEs); that birthplace and location remain potent determinants of work destination and earnings capacity; and that being male and single motivates rural inhabitants to seek OFAs to a much greater extent than other household members. These findings have implications for those responsible for framing policy. In particular, a further round of liberalization to favour OFAs is suggested.

40|$|Block and Webb (2001) in {{food policy}} {{address the issue}} of the {{dynamics}} of livelihood diversification in Ethiopia. Their study uses the ratio of per capita income derived from crops to the sum of all other incomes as an indicator of livelihood diversification for the years 1989 and 1994. Their study focuses only on drought-prone areas during the survey years. The aim of the present study is to explore further the demographic and economic determinants of the dynamics of income diversification using survey data. The data used in this study cover larger and more representative sample and was colleted from rural Ethiopia during 1994 and 1997 harvest years. This study investigates not only the determinants of participation and intensity of off-farm activities, but also factors that affect the dynamics between 1994 and 1997. The results of this study attempt to answer the question: to what extent initial conditions (for instance, asset holdings, production, and crop income) prompt households to diversify to off-farm activities overtime. The results show that participation in off-farm activities is mainly driven by demographic factors, whereas land and other asset ownership as well as crop production and income affect intensity of off-farm activities. The dynamic model results show that farm families who have initially diversified to more off-farm activities subsequently realized less income diversification. Families with more initial crop production from slack harvest season subsequently realized greater income from off-farm activities in 1997. The study also confirms that it is only during slack harvest season that off-farm and on-farm activities are complement each other.

The data was collected by postal survey in 2001. The survey was sent to all Finnish bookkeeping farms, excluding greenhouse enterprises. The survey was sent to 1 056 farms. The response rate was 74 %. The collected survey data was integrated with the bookkeeping results. Most farmers (87 % of the respondents) intents to continue farming by themselves during 2001 - 2005. Approximately 9 % of farmers were planning succession in their farm during the same period. These two groups had different plans for future production, especially those concerning the animal production. On those farms, where farmers intented to continue farming themselves, 68 % of the farmers planned to maintain {{the current level of}} animal husbandry and 21 % to expand it. On the other hand, on those farms, which were preparing to succession 45 % intended to maintain the current level, 27 % to expand it and 22 % to give up the animal husbandry. Farms that intended to expand their agricultural production were bigger than those farms that intended to maintain the current level of production. The average turnover and operating profit were bigger in expanding farms. On the other hand, their depreciation, financing costs and liabilities were higher. Thus, those farms, which were going to expand had already earlier invested more into agriculture. Quite naturally, expanding farms were going to invest more to agriculture than the others did. 55 % of the farms were pluriactive. 25 % of the farms had diversified their activities to nonagricultural on-farm or off-farm entrepreneurship. In addition, in 44 % of the farms had least some income from off-farm employment. Pluriactivity is more common in crop producing farms than in livestock farms.

40|$|In Southeast Asia, inland fish {{resources}} are crucial for small-scale fishing households. Their decline, due to overfishing {{and a set}} of socio-ecological factors, jeopardises aquatic ecosystems and the livelihoods of fishing communities. Singkarak Lake (West Sumatra) exemplifies this sustainability challenge. The paper proposes a multi-disciplinary analysis of the situation. First, it identifies and documents the primary livelihood systems and the strategic adaptations involved in fishing communities. Based upon a sample of 200 households and the implementation of multivariate analyses, a typology is developed. Three household types are identified. Type I comprises better-off farming fishers that have high fishing capitals and income but the lowest returns on fishing and land assets. Type II includes poor fishing farmers with higher farming income; they show the highest return on land assets. Type III is composed of poorer, younger fishers with the highest return on fishing assets and fishing costs. They have little land, low farming income, and diversified livelihood sources. Second, the technical efficiency (TE) of fishing households is studied using a data envelopment analysis. The results show that the average TE is low, but marked differences exist between the types. Type I households have the lowest TE in fishing, confirming an extensification and overcapitalisation strategy. Type II households show a high technical fishing efficiency. They have developed on-farm diversification with a combined, balanced livelihood system. Type III households are the most efficient fishers. They developed an intensification strategy together with <b>off-farm</b> <b>diversification.</b> Different livelihood strategies and economic portfolio have been developed as the response to the limited resources, uncertainty, fluctuating environment and other source of vulnerability. The fishers built up their livelihood based on their assets' ownership, access to other resource out of fishing and their socio-economic status. In this context, understanding livelihood diversity among small-scale fishers, different socio-economic, their efficiency, constraints and opportunities emerge as important factor in policy formulation to enhance support to small-scale fishing communities and improved management of both the resources and local development. Finally, the paper suggests a focus on people and community-related solutions and proposes a threefold approach of resource conservation, livelihood improvements and restructured governance.

40|$|Rural {{households}} in Bangladesh are {{highly dependent on}} agriculture for their livelihoods. As in other developing countries, these households have followed different livelihood strategies {{to move out of}} poverty and, in the process, changes have occurred in the roles and positions of household members. Government, non-government, and donor agencies have long been promoting new innovations in the agricultural sector, but the level and sustainability of adoption depends on multiple factors, including both technical and socio-economic aspects. However, the socio-economic aspects of the intervention and innovation process have not been addressed adequately. In particular, the lack of attention to gender roles in household decision making and the implementation of new practices has been a major deficiency. The overall aim of the research is to understand the changing roles of women (and, more broadly, of gender relations) in the construction of rural livelihoods in rice-based farming systems of Bangladesh. The research draws on the rural livelihoods framework to analyse agricultural change within the context of broader rural livelihood strategies, including on- and <b>off-farm</b> <b>diversification.</b> Using a case-study approach, the research focuses on two villages in Noakhali District with contrasting bio-physical and socio-economic settings. Both qualitative and quantitative techniques have been applied. The primary findings reveal that in the traditional patriarchal society of rural Bangladesh, women have distinct roles and a subordinate position in both the household and the village community. However, the traditional roles and status of women are changing in response to changes (shocks and trends) in household livelihoods. The thesis analyses how women’s roles and status are being re-defined and adapted in these changing contexts. Drawing on case histories of individuals and {{households in}} the villages, the thesis examines the influence of household composition, household assets, farming activities, seasonal and international migration of men, the weakening of extended family norms, and interventions by government and non-government agencies. It is found that gender relations, especially women’s roles and status within the household, are being renegotiated in response to extreme poverty, {{the ebb and flow of}} male migration, and the activities of change agents, resulting in a diversity of practice, even within social groups adhering to the same religious and cultural norms. These findings justify the importance of focusing on gender roles in the construction of agricultural livelihoods. The results will help agricultural scientists, development workers, and policy-makers to re-think technical interventions from the perspective of rural livelihoods and, in particular, to address women as active agents along with men in agricultural and other development planning and implementation...|$|E

Household’s survival depends {{on the ability to}} anticipate and to cope with this uncertain income. Through time, households have developed ex-ante risk management and ex-post risk coping strategies. These include crop portfolio adjustments and <b>off-farm</b> activity <b>diversification.</b> This thesis investigates the role of rainfall and rainfall risk on households’ risk management and risk coping strategies. Econometric models based on the neo-classical household production and consumption model were used. These methods were applied to a four-year (1996, 1997, 2001, and 2002) panel data sample of Tigray (Northern Ethiopia) farm households. The study showed that farmers’ ex-ante strategic response to rainfall risk is through diversification of crops to be grown. Choosing the crops most suited to specific rainfall conditions was proven to be a strategy of farmers to cope with unpredictable rainfall. In times of low rainfall, the dominant crops to be chosen are teff and grass pea. Rainfall risk also increases the probability of off-farm labor supply. Therefore, households’ off-farm labor supply can be seen as an ex-ante and ex-post income smoothing strategy. Moreover, this study showed that ex-post consumption variability and rainfall risk negatively correlated with ex-ante fertilizer adoption decisions. This implies that households are biased toward technologies that are less risky. This leads to the conclusion that any mechanism that allows farmers to smooth consumption ex-post will raise ex-ante fertilizer adoption. Ex-ante crop choice, fertilizer adoption, and reliable water availability for farming can be viewed as complements. These complementarities suggest that policies that focus on rainwater harvesting techniques and promoting small-scale irrigation would promote fertilizer adoption. Reducing rainfall-induced risk leads to more fertilizer use, and therefore, to more production and income. Expansion of off-farm employment opportunities inside and outside agriculture would also improve households’ risk management and risk coping capacities. ...|$|R

A mixed methods approach has been used. A survey of members of the Rural Contractors New Zealand, the national organisation and leading advocate for rural contractors, was followed by a case study approach to explore the perceptions of and relationships between rural contractors and sheep and beef farmers. The results have been divided into three sections. One section considers the labour use on farms and the ability of farmers to gain numerical flexibility through the use of casual labour and contractors as there are increasing disincentives for employing permanent workers. Contractors are used for the skills they have gained through specialisation, the machinery and technology they can offer, and as a substitute for other labour. The ageing of farmers, the paucity of skilled farm employees and increasing pluriactivity all indicate that the contracting sector will grow in importance. The second section considers the environment in which contractors work. The availability of suitable labour, weather, competition, financial viability and health and safety are the major short term issues they face while their long term concerns revolve around the profile of their industry, increasing legislative requirements and the state of the economy. The third section considers the relationship between the two parties and finds there is a relatively harmonious relationship based on a development of trust between farmer and contractor. Contractors make a significant contribution to rural communities, by providing off-farm work and casual workers for the farming sector, and contributing to the economic and social health of local areas. Increasing farm productivity, and increasing farm accreditation requirements to meet the changing market demand for credence properties in agricultural products, are likely to require further input from the rural contracting industry in the future...|$|R

This is in a context that smallholder farmers’ participation is reported to be very low, despite several claimed benefits of beekeeping. Moreover, despite receiving substantial endorsements as a resilient climate-smart rural livelihood, <b>off-farm,</b> forest, non-timber <b>diversification</b> strategy; the uptake of beekeeping by smallholder farmers in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa still remains very low. Against this background, this study used cross-sectional survey data to gauge smallholder farmers’ perceptions and factors that influence their participation in beekeeping using a binary regression model; further, it measured the contribution of beekeeping to rural household income using a linear regression model. Descriptive statistics revealed that majority of the people from the study area have positive perceptions regarding beekeeping. Regression estimates further indicate that beekeeping is mostly conditioned by shared perceptions, institutional and socio-economic factors that are worth targeting to promote the uptake of beekeeping as a livelihood. Public policies that influence the institutional framework (extension, credit and market) in favour of beekeeping are more likely to promote participation in beekeeping activities. Also, more research on the documentation and benefits of beekeeping supported by investments targeting educational campaigns towards promoting positive attitudes and dispelling fears and myths surrounding beekeeping as an enterprise, will also promote the participation of smallholder farmers in beekeeping. Regression estimates for determinants of household income revealed a significant positive contribution of beekeeping to household income, education, gender and age. Promotion of beekeeping may therefore address household income that is worth targeting to address rural poverty. The study therefore concludes that to fully unlock the income potential of beekeeping for smallholder farmers, development agencies need to address several negative perceptions and institutional factors that affect beekeeping participation, while more research is required to quantify the claimed benefits of beekeeping, given their positive potential to promote farmers’ interests in beekeeping...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} adoption of soil conservation technologies among farmers participating in the Environmental Program of El Salvador (PAES). A sample of PAES participants was surveyed in 2002, from which a sub-sample was re-surveyed in 2005 along with a control group of non-participating households. This is an ex-post evaluation of PAES {{and there is no}} baseline and no randomized control group. Therefore, quasi-experimental techniques were applied to select the treatment and comparison groups after the intervention occurred. Matching techniques were employed to construct a comparison group that resembles the treatment group based on observed characteristics while statistical controls were applied to measure differences on adoption of soil conservation for the treatment group at two points in time (2002 and 2005) and between the treatment and comparison groups at a given point in time (2005), allowing for before-after and with-without comparisons. Two adoption models (Conservation Practices and Conservation Structures) were estimated using two separate samples (PAES beneficiaries 2002 - 2005 and beneficiaries-control group 2005). We then analyzed the factors associated with disadoption of the technologies in 2005 relative to 2002. Overall, the adoption of practices and structures is positively associated with schooling, <b>off-farm</b> earnings, crop <b>diversification,</b> technical assistance, participation in social organizations, frequency of extension visits and access to local markets. More importantly, PAES beneficiaries have increased significantly the area treated with conservation between 2002 and 2005. The results confirm that the project intervention (frequency of extension visits and years with project) is positively associated with adoption. Our findings also indicate that access to agricultural markets and rural infrastructure and institutions is crucial for adoption and diffusion of new technologies. Two probit models are estimated to examine the disadoption of practices and structures using the 2002 - 2005 data for PAES beneficiaries. These models indicate that off-farm income, education, frequency of extension visits, years with PAES and participation in social organizations are significant contributors to reducing the probability of disadoption of conservation technologies. In turn, disadoption is significantly associated with farm size. Disadopters of practices tend to be younger than adopters and have more diversified and larger farms with more access to input and output markets. In turn, disadopters of structures tend to have larger and more steeply farms, are more involved in social organizations and have less access to input and output markets and local infrastructure.

40|$|Reducing food {{insecurity}} {{in the developing}} world continues to be a major public policy challenge, and one that is complicated by the lack of a generalized comprehensive strategy for dealing with it. Around 854 million people are undernourished worldwide, many more suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, and the absolute numbers tend to increase further, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Recent food price hikes have contributed to greater public awareness of hunger related problems, also resulting in new international commitments to invest in developing country agriculture. Whereas agriculture-led growth {{played an important role in}} reducing {{food insecurity}} and transforming the economies of many Asian and Latin American countries, the same has not yet occurred in Africa. Most countries in Africa have not yet met the criteria for a successful agricultural revolution, and factor productivity lags far behind the rest of the world. This has led to growing skepticism in the international development discourse about the relevance of agriculture to food security in the region. As a result, the promotion of off-farm activities as a pathway out of food insecurity has gained widespread support among development agencies and non-governmental organizations. So far, relatively little policy efforts have been made to promote the off-farm sector in a pro-poor way and overcome potential constraints in countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. One reason is probably the dearth of solid and up-to-date information about the impact of off-farm income on food security and nutrition in specific context. While the poverty implications of off-farm income have been analyzed in different developing countries, much less is known about the impact of off-farm income on household food security and nutrition. 2 This paper analyzes the role of off-farm income in enhancing food security and nutrition for households in rural Nigeria. The analysis builds on a survey of 220 households in Kwara State, which was conducted in 2006. Food consumption data were elicited through a 7 -day recall, covering 105 food items. The food consumption data are supplemented by anthropometric measurements that we took from pre-school children up to 60 months of age. In the 220 sample households, we obtained weight and height data from 127 children. Different Econometric analyses are employed to examine the mechanisms by which off-farm income affects household calorie and micronutrient supply, dietary quality, and child anthropometry. We hypothesize that off-farm income contributes to better nutrition in terms of calorie and micronutrient supply and child anthropometry. Issues of endogeneity are taken into account by using instrumental variable approaches. Both descriptive analyses and econometric approaches showed that off-farm income contributes to improved calorie supply at the household level. We find that off-farm income has a positive net effect on food security and nutrition, which is in the same magnitude as the effect of farm income. We also show that the prevalence of stunting and underweight is remarkably lower among children in households with off-farm income. Accordingly, improving poor households’ access to the off-farm sector can contribute to reducing problems of rural malnutrition. Our results demonstrate that both farm and off-farm activities can equally contribute to better food security and nutrition. Yet, while investing into agricultural growth is currently featuring high on the development policy agenda, promoting the rural off-farm sector receives much less attention. This should be rectified, especially in regions where agricultural resources are becoming increasingly scarce. Using a structural model, we also show that off-farm income contributes to higher food production and farm income by easing capital constraints, thus improving household welfare in multiple ways. <b>Off-farm</b> income <b>diversification</b> is already an extensive phenomenon 3 among rural households in developing countries. But without a clear policy strategy on how to support this process in a pro-poor way, outcomes might socially undesirable, because of unequal household access to certain off-farm activities.

40|$|This thesis explores human-wildlife {{interactions}} under community managed game parks. The thesis {{consists of}} an introductory chapter, study location chapter and four self-contained studies based on different samples from created clusters surrounding Nyatana Game Park, which make {{up the rest of}} the thesis chapters. Chapter one presents an introductory overview of wildlife management in Zimbabwe, specifically looking at human-wildlife interactions under CAMPFIRE projects, welfare dynamics and conservation implications for the surrounding communities who share boundaries with community-managed game parks. The chapter concludes by highlighting the challenges facing community-based wildlife conservation in Zimbabwe as well as the key concepts that will be the subject of the rest of the thesis. Chapter two presents the study location; it highlights the road map to the study area, starting with the provincial location, and indicates the specific districts from which respondents were selected. A brief agro-ecological summary of the study area is also presented; it looks specifically at climate, vegetation and a demographic data of the study area. Chapter three: Can game parks be trusted as livelihood sources? To answer this topical question, Chapter three explores livelihood adaptation strategies for households who share boundaries with Nyatana Game Park. Most of the community managed game parks, under CAMPFIRE principles in Zimbabwe, were established with the primary objective of generating revenue for the surrounding communities; this was done in the hope of using positive returns from game farming to promote the conservation of wildlife. Has this materialised in practice? Descriptive results from this study seem to suggest otherwise, where mixed farming and gold panning were the major livelihood adaptation choices reported by most households. The revenue from game farming was reported to be too low and inconsistent, to such an extent that the majority of the community regarded it as risky and unreliable. A multinomial logistic regression model for correlates of adaptation choices indicated that access to credit, markets, and extension may be some of the current institutional constraints inhibiting households from accessing off-farm sources for their livelihoods. In addition, household size, gender and age may enhance the adaptive capacity of households to move out of risky crop faming into other <b>off-farm</b> portfolio <b>diversifications.</b> The study, therefore, suggests that game parks, according to the evidence uncovered by the study, may not be trusted as a reliable and sustainable livelihood source. If local communities who share boundaries with game parks do not view them as reliable and sustainable livelihood sources, as concluded in Chapter three, how can they (local communities) be trusted to conserve them? To assess their perceptions of game parks, Chapter four presents a multinomial logistic regression model for perceptions of society on game parks using the African elephant as a typical example. The results suggest that Problem Animal Control (PAC) perceptions, livestock predation and issues of low and poor revenue distribution may be some of the critical perceptions capable of influencing surrounding communities to negatively participate in the conservation of wildlife. The results further suggest that using wildlife proceeds to finance observable local common pool infrastructure may positively influence the surrounding communities to conserve wildlife. The chief conclusion regarding game parks, therefore, was that the surrounding communities were in favour of the obliteration pathway, although minimal conservation perceptions were also available. Given the negative conclusions regarding game parks, as suggested in Chapters three and four, citizens would then wonder if any meaningful hope for community managed game parks exists. Chapter five probes the buffer zone livelihood link under community managed game parks, using evidence from the Nyatana Game Park. The binary logistic regression model results, for buffer zone participation and resource extraction combinations by surrounding communities, suggest that resource extraction may be market driven rather than focussing on domestic consumption. The study therefore concludes that the buffer zone livelihood link as currently practiced, though potential, may fail to address the livelihood expectations of the sub-district producer communities. The study therefore calls for extreme caution whenever the buffer zone livelihood link is considered, because several institutional and design conflicts exist within this dynamic. In Chapter six, the study further probed the buffer zone income dynamics for the sub-district producer community. The results of descriptive statistics suggest that the contribution of buffer zone activities to household income may be significant with a positive correlation to household agricultural income for communities who reside inside or close to the park (primary sub-district producer community). Using the Gini decomposition approach and Lorenz curves, the study concluded that a buffer zone income may be capable of contributing to more equally distributed incomes for rural communities who share boundaries with game parks. With respect to the correlates of household income, the results suggest that household size and age may negatively influence income from buffer zone activities, while gender may have a positive effect. This was also true for education and Livestock Units (LUs) with respect to income from self employment; the former positively and the latter negatively related. The results further suggest that land size may also be positively significant in order to explain income from agriculture as well as total income. With regard to the distance from the buffer zone, the results suggest a negative influence with respect to the buffer zone, agriculture and total income. The implied message therefore suggests that buffer zones may provide active livelihood sources which are capable of financing rural household agriculture. The income equalizing effect which is portrayed may also further imply that, if correctly targeted and promoted, a buffer zone income could possibly address the current income inequality which is generic in rural areas. However, this potential may not be realized due to the current buffer zone design status (created for local secondary use as opposed to commercial primary use), restrictive policies and poor institutional support. With this dilemma facing community managed game parks (threats as summarised in Chapters three and four amid the potential hope summarized in Chapters five and six), Chapter 7 concludes the study by suggesting that the human-wildlife interaction model, though currently theoretical, may have significant practical potential in addressing the livelihoods of the surrounding communities as well as promoting the conservation of wildlife. This could be possible if available challenges that range from low revenue, insecure property rights, high human-elephant conflict and institutional design conflict for buffer zone utilization are corrected by means of the free market system. This would allow market forces to deliver on the expectations of the ―human-wildlife interactions model‖ – sustainable livelihoods for the former and intergenerational conservation for the latter...|$|R
40|$|The {{promotion}} of off-farm activities and income diversification {{in order to}} provide alternative income earning opportunities for rural households in developing countries has received increased policy attention recently. The growing importance of off-farm activities has also led to rising interest in analyzing the wider implications for household livelihoods and rural development, especially in Africa. In this dissertation, the impact of <b>off-farm</b> income <b>diversification</b> on income, food security and nutrition is analyzed in rural Nigeria. This is done within the scope of three research articles. The analyses build on a survey of 220 farm households, which was carried out in Kwara State, north-central Nigeria, in 2006. The first article is entitled ?The role of off-farm income in rural Nigeria: Driving forces and household access?. Off-farm employment is disaggregated into different segments to take account of heterogeneity in the rural labor market. Various econometric techniques are used to model the determinants of household participation in and income from different economic activities. Furthermore, the contribution of the individual income sources to overall income inequality is examined using the Gini decomposition method. Results indicate that almost 90 % of the households sampled have at least some off-farm income; on average, off-farm income accounts for 50 % of total household income. Sixty-five percent of the households are involved in some type of off-farm employment ? 44 % in agricultural wage employment, 40 % in non-agricultural wage employment, and 50 % in self-employed non-farm activities. In fact, self-employed activities are the dominant source of off-farm income, accounting for almost one-fourth of overall household income. The share of off-farm income is positively correlated with overall income, indicating that the relatively richer households benefit much more from the off-farm sector. Strikingly, the share of off-farm income also increases with farm size, suggesting that there are important complementarities between farm and off-farm income. The econometric analysis shows that households with little productive assets and those who are disadvantaged in terms of education and infrastructure are constrained in their ability to participate in more lucrative off-farm activities. Accordingly, off-farm income tends to increases income inequality. The analysis counters the widespread notion that shrinking per capita land availability is always the main driving force for the growing importance of off-farm activities. It shows that financial capital rather than land is the scarcest factor for farm households in the study region, so that cash income from off-farm activities can also help to expand farm production. Entry barriers to off-farm activities for poor households need to be overcome to promote equitable rural development. In the second article, entitled ?Impact of off-farm income on food security and nutrition in Nigeria?, 7 -day food expenditure and anthropometric data are used to analyze the effects of off-farm income on household calorie consumption, dietary quality, micronutrient supply and child nutritional status. Descriptive analysis indicates that engagement in off-farm activities is associated with higher calorie consumption and a reduced prevalence of undernourishment. Dietary quality, measured by the calorie supply that comes from fruits, vegetables and animal products, is also higher among households with off-farm income. Similarly, households with off-farm income enjoy a higher supply of micronutrients, particularly iron and vitamin A. Child nutritional status, indicated by the average Z-scores for height-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-height of children aged 0 to 5 years, is also better in households with off-farm income. Employing instrumental variable approaches, econometric analyses confirms that the net effect of off-farm income on household food security and nutrition is positive and in the same magnitude as the effect of farm income. This is an interesting result, because it is often believed that farm income is more important than off-farm income for food security and dietary quality in rural areas. Accordingly, improving poor households? access to the off-farm sector can contribute to reducing problems of rural malnutrition. In the third article, entitled ?Patterns of income diversification in rural Nigeria: Determinants and impacts?, descriptive analysis is used to examine income diversification patterns among households, disaggregated by income classes and livelihood strategies. Econometric models, focusing on three measures of income diversification ? the number of income sources, the share of off-farm income in total income and the Herfindahl diversification index ? are also estimated. The impact of diversification on total household income is analyzed using an instrumental variable approach. The results indicate that rural households in Nigeria have indeed a diversified income base, with 93 % having at least two sources of income. Interestingly, richer households tend to be more diversified than poorer ones, and income diversification leads to net increases in total household income. Yet, the regression models also show that households have unequal abilities to diversify their income sources. Education, asset endowment, access to credit and good infrastructure conditions increase the levels of household diversification. These factors improve the opportunities to start own businesses and find employment in the higher-paying non-farm sector. In other words, resource-poor households in remoter areas are more constrained in diversifying their income sources. What are the broader policy implications? Enhancing poor households? access to off-farm activities is important to support equitable rural development, since farming alone often cannot sustain a sufficient livelihood. In the Nigerian context ? as in many other parts of SSA ? this requires improvements in the physical infrastructure, including roads, electricity, water, and telecommunication, but also improvements in rural education and financial markets. But up to what level is income diversification desirable? According to economic theory, specialization allows exploitation of comparative advantages and economies of scale, resulting in higher profits and household incomes. Hence, when markets function properly, diversification is associated with foregone benefits. When there is risk involved and formal insurance markets fail, these foregone benefits can be considered as an informal insurance fee that poor households in particular are willing to pay. But the fact that richer households are more diversified in rural Nigeria suggests that there are other mechanisms at work, too. An important motive for richer households to have highly diversified income sources instead of specializing more is that there are limited opportunities to expand single economic activities. This is mainly due to markets that are small and poorly integrated in rural Nigeria, which again is largely a function of infrastructure weaknesses. Better roads, for instance, would enable villagers to commute to the next bigger town, where they might find more stable employment. Better roads and information networks would also improve marketing opportunities for food and non-food products originating from household self-employed activities. Therefore, income diversification should not be considered as a policy objective per se. Rather, it has to be understood as a household response to various market imperfections. Hence, the policy objective should be to reduce these imperfections and make markets work better. While this would facilitate income diversification among the poorest, it would probably promote a higher degree of specialization among relatively richer households. Die Förderung von außerlandwirtschaftlichen Tätigkeiten und von Einkommensdiversifizierung hat in letzter Zeit mehr Beachtung in der Politik gefunden mit dem Ziel, alternative Einkommensmöglichkeiten für ländliche Haushalte in Entwicklungsländern zur Verfügung zu stellen. Die zunehmende Bedeutung von außerlandwirtschaftlichen Tätigkeiten führte zu einem steigenden Interesse, die weitergehenden Auswirkungen auf den Lebensunterhalt in Haushalten und auf die ländliche Entwicklung, besonders in Afrika, zu untersuchen. In vorliegenden Dissertation wird der Einfluss von außerlandwirtschaftlichem Einkommen auf Gesamteinkommen, Ernährungssicherung und Ernährungsstatus im ländlichen Nigeria untersucht. Dies wird im Rahmen von drei Forschungsartikeln durchgeführt. Die Analyse baut auf einer Befragung von 220 landwirtschaftlichen Haushalten auf, die 2006 im Bundesstaat Kwara in nord-zentral Nigeria durchgeführt wurde. Der erste Artikel trägt den Titel ?The role of off-farm income in rural Nigeria: Driving forces and household access?. Außerlandwirschaftliche Beschäftigung wird in verschiedene Segmente disaggregiert, um der Heterogeneität in ländlichen Arbeitsmärkten gerecht zu werden. Verschiedene ökonometrische Techniken werden angewendet, um die Einflussgrößen der Teilnahme an und das Einkommen aus verschiedenen ökonomischen Tätigkeiten zu modellieren. Darüber hinaus wird der Beitrag einzelner Einkommensquellen zu Einkommensungleichheit unter Zuhilfenahme der Gini decomposition Methode untersucht. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass fast 90 % der ausgewählten Haushalte zumindest irgendein außerlandwirtschaftliches Einkommen haben; im Durchschnitt macht außerlandwirtschaftliches Einkommen 50 % des gesamten Haushaltseinkommens aus. 65 % der Haushalte sind in irgendeiner Form in außerlandwirtschaftliche Beschäftigung involviert ? 44 % in landwirtschaftlicher Lohntätigkeit, 40 % in nicht-landwirtschaftlicher Lohntätigkeit und 50 % in selbständigen nicht-landwirtschaftlichen Tätigkeiten.
