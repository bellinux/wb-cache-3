30|$|Another phenomenon, {{related to}} sustainability, that will {{drastically}} influence the daily practice of architecture studios throughout Europe {{is the fact}} that new construction will not get back to levels comparable to before 2008. This may be partly compensated by an increase in renovation and rehabilitation projects, which responds to a general tendency in our society not to replace but to re-use and re-cycle commodities. But it might also go beyond that and lead to extreme scenarios, like the process that is taking place actually {{in the southern part of}} the Netherlands, in the so-called ‘Parkstad’ region. There the ongoing demographic population decrease has caused not only the demolition of <b>obsolete</b> <b>housing</b> blocks but even the disappearing of entire streets, like the Govert Flinckstraat in the city of Heerlen, where housing corporation Woonpunt demolished several housing blocks entirely.

40|$|The need {{to combat}} decay of <b>obsolete</b> <b>housing</b> and {{services}} in urban renewal areas has been recognized by every major country in Western Europe, including the Netherlands (Couch et al., 2003). Urban regeneration in general {{can be considered as}} developing an approach in a complex urban context that includes a variety of spatial scales, sectors, actors and disciplines. Urban regeneration needs to respond to changing contexts with new economic concentrations in cities that are accompanied by new markets for new population groups within the current urban population (Sassen, 1991). This situation is sometimes in conflict with the living conditions of specific groups in the urban population trapped in economic difficulties, excluded from opportunities and rights. The other side of the same coin and with as the common underlying factor a change in economic structure caused by global competition and technological innovation (Drewe et al. 2008). Urban regeneration needs to respond to new conditions and can therefore not be a static phenomenon. Two basic concerns have become part of the agenda in all new strategies for urban regeneration, namely the search for lasting solutions and an integrated approach to physical, environmental, social and economic programs.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} based on {{material}} gathered {{as part of a}} larger, multi-methodological study of public participation in Structure Planning in Cleveland County in the North East of England. The variations in local responses to planning policies were investigated through the use of the social networks approach, in which the interaction between individuals and sets of individuals was the main focus of the analysis. The case-study in this thesis covers an area in which there was little, if any, response to the Structure Plans. It is, therefore, primarily an explanation of non-participation. The former "ironstone mining settlements of the Skelton and Brotton area of East Cleveland are marked by declining employment opportunities, poor roads and facilities, and much old and <b>obsolete</b> <b>housing.</b> The image of dereliction, fragmentation and deprivation is reinforced by the planners' treatment of the area, both in the plans and in the way that public participation in the area was managed. Analysis of interaction in networks shows some inter- penetration of group membership, but no coherent, enduring involvement by participators from more than one village together, raising questions of cohesion and conflict. Within the context of fragmentation and competition between villages, the impact of major demolition and renovation schemes is assessed. The explanation of non-participation in a situation of clear inequality and disadvantage necessitates the use of power theory of a more radical type than that which has usually been applied to the inherently political process of planning. A theoretical frame work adequate to deal with the powerlessness of a population whose interests are adversely affected by those in power, is a modified version of Lukes' three-dimensional approach. Ideological factors such as deference can thus be related to the acquiescence found...|$|E
40|$|RESUMEN En el aire es un viaje a la primera mitad del siglo XX que nos tratará de acercar la frescura y oportunidad de las calles corredor y los jardines en la ciudad vertical. Se inicia en 1909 en Nueva York, con la publicación por la revista Life de La Torre del Globo, se acerca al Inmueble-Villas y al Plan Obus para Argel de Le Corbusier, y finaliza en 1952 con el {{proyecto}} para el conjunto residencial de Golden Lane en Londres de A. y P. Smithson. Fragmentos para la ciudad vertical que se construía sobre papel, tras el espejo, paralela en el tiempo, pero muy distinta a la ciudad real, con el objetivo {{entre otros}} de integrar arquitectura y naturaleza. Esas propuestas siguen teniendo hoy un gran valor, en un panorama en que el espacio público ligado a la vivienda colectiva, prácticamente ha desaparecido, y el esfuerzo que se demanda al arquitecto se centra, en tejer a modo de encaje de bolillos, una fachada que envuelva un programa de vivienda, funcional y espacialmente obsoleto.

It begins in 1909 in New York, with the publication in Life magazine of the Globe Tower, it approaches the Immeubles-Villas and Plan Obus for Algiers by Le Corbusier, and ends in 1952 with the project for the Golden Lane Estate residential complex in London, by A. and P. Smithson. Fragments for the vertical city that was constructed on paper, behind the mirror, parallel in time, but was very different from the real city, with the aim, inter alia, of integrating architecture and nature. These proposals continue to have great value today, in a scenario where the public space linked to the collective home has virtually disappeared, and the effort that is demanded of the architect focuses on weaving a facade like bobbin lace around a functionally and spatially <b>obsolete</b> <b>housing</b> programme...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to define an {{approach}} to a methodological assessment of existing urban patterns that allows us to verify, from an analytical, comparative and critical scope, the return to the consolidated city as a necessary way of developing new urban fabric. After reconsidering the history of large-scale urban projects in Madrid, the design of the <b>obsolete</b> collective <b>housing</b> in the consolidated city has revealed the existing residential areas as an infrastructure potentially capable of absorbing the complexity of the unpredictable future. The solution does not fall on the design of a specific project for each building, but in defining a general project for the city that we inherited and for the city that we will bequeath. This approach is supported by an original methodology developed by GIVCO (Research Group in Collective Housing-Polytechnic University of Madrid). The research process goes from the typological to the urban scale, digging into the impact of expansion areas and reconstructing the urban process as a continuum, predicting its main layouts for the near future. On one hand, the analysis of satellite settlements built in the fifties in the case study of Madrid, unveils a struggle to achieve a model in which building types and urban planning cannot be separated from each other. The urban pattern was understood as a system in which social housing and public space are the basic configurative elements. Problems such as the lack of coherence with the city center or the deterioration of construction can be noticed although the quality of the public space remains the same...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARYThe {{objective}} of the journal {{is to be an}} active agent of research in architecture and urbanism and to contribute to the production of constructive debate. There are as many ideas about landscape as there are ideas about architecture and here we attempt to explore some of them. The articles in this issue are heterogeneous, diverse and, simultaneously, full of coincidences, for that reason I believe they need to be read without haste. Reflections are offered on the origin of the concept of architecture in opposition to nature, on contradiction, dialectic discourse, debate and evolution. The planning process is vindicated as a continuum between learning and creative contribution. It is indiscriminate. All architecture, whether small or localized, has a responsibility within the construction of the landscape. The plurality of public space, the new ways of producing urban space and its history from the ethnographic artists are all observed. The theories distilled from this cocktail of ideas serve to lead us to a state, independent of the passage of time, to revive specific and current problems such as the regeneration of <b>obsolete,</b> social <b>housing</b> districts. This vindicates the need to manage urban-planning operations with full architectural control. Several authors show us, through works and critical reflection, how the architect can make a long-term research project of their career. In order to bring the experience of successive sources of superimposed thoughts to a consistent closure, we have recovered an unpublished article by the lecturer Manuel Trillo de Leyva, which is current, pertinent, multi-faceted and integrates all the contributions in a balanced and essential way. His analysis on Foster’s intervention in the Reichstag reveals the integrating position that architecture should occupy within history...|$|R

50|$|From {{the early}} 2000s, greater {{inequity}} in the income and wealth of Australians saw declining levels of home ownership, {{increasing numbers of}} long-term private renters and greater numbers of households experiencing housing stress. This placed governments and housing providers under greater pressure. All states and territories renewed calls for the Commonwealth Government to take an integrated, national approach to housing policy and address housing and related issues such as health, education and employment. Changes to the Commonwealth Government's funding preferences through the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement increasingly directed funds away from {{the construction of new}} public housing and into programs to assist low-income earners rent accommodation in the private market. The demand for housing in Queensland had never been higher. The State's population grew by more than 634,000 persons from 1991 to 2001, mainly due to interstate migration. In 2003, the Queensland population reached 3.7 million. Australia's population continued to age and diversify. A growing number of people with specialised housing needs were not being catered for by the private housing market. House prices continued to rise and young professionals and retirees in particular flocked to embrace inner-city living. Burgeoning residential developments and gentrification saw older residential and former industrial areas turned into bustling new communities, further reducing the amount of affordable inner-city housing. Many people with lower incomes were moving to areas with cheaper housing and often worse access to employment and other services. As a result, the Department of Housing took a more sophisticated approach to developing sustainable housing options to meet Queensland's housing needs in the 21st century. Research, client participation and consultation, cross-government collaboration and partnerships with the private sector became standard business practice for the department. Housing design became more innovative with economic, social and environmental sustainability high on the agenda. With these changes it became apparent that the legislation that provided the legal basis for all of the Commission's activity since its inception, had begun to inhibit rather than embrace the development of innovative housing solutions. Many aspects of the State Housing Act 1945, which was written {{at a time when the}} Queensland Government's focus was on assisting families into home ownership immediately after World War II, were no longer relevant to address Queensland's housing needs in the 21st century. So in 2003, after many years of development and consultation, new housing legislation was tabled in Parliament to replace the <b>obsolete</b> State <b>Housing</b> Act 1945 and to provide a modern basis for the Department of Housing's activities. In January 2004, the Housing Act 2003 took effect and officially marked the end of 58 years of the Queensland Housing Commission. The legislation was a turning point that provided an opportunity to reflect on close to 60 years of hard work, innovation and commitment to meeting housing need in Queensland, through times of hardship and prosperity. It also allowed the department to embrace the changing direction its activities had taken and to pursue new partnerships and solutions.|$|R
