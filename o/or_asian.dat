5|$|As a young social worker, in 1963 Stephenson led {{a boycott}} of the Bristol Omnibus Company, protesting against its refusal to employ Black <b>or</b> <b>Asian</b> drivers or conductors. After a 60-day boycott {{supported}} by thousands of Bristolians, the company revoked its colour bar in August. In 1964 Stephenson achieved national fame when he refused to leave a public house until he was served, resulting in a trial {{on a charge of}} failing to leave a licensed premises. His campaigns were instrumental in paving the way for the first Race Relations Act, in 1965. Stephenson is a Freeman of the City of Bristol and was awarded an OBE in 2009.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} British cities, there was {{immigration}} from various Commonwealth {{countries in the}} post war years, which did lead to some racist tension. In 1963, a colour bar operated by Bristol Omnibus Company, which at that time refused to employ Black <b>or</b> <b>Asian</b> bus crews, was successfully challenged in the Bristol Bus Boycott, which was considered to have been instrumental in the eventual passage of the Race Relations Act 1968. In 1980 a police raid on a cafe in St Paul's sparked the St Pauls riot, which highlighted the alienation of the city's ethnic minorities.|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Labor market {{characteristics}} vary dramatically {{according to}} race and ethnicity. While workers in all groups experience labor market difficulties, Blacks and Hispanics disproportionately suffer from serious labor market problems. This occurs despite gains in average educational attainment and increased representation in higher-paying occupations among these groups. Blacks and Hispanics {{are more likely}} than Whites <b>or</b> <b>Asians</b> to be unemployed. When employed, Blacks and Hispanics are much more likely than Whites <b>or</b> <b>Asians</b> to be working in lower-paying occupations...|$|R

5|$|The {{approximate}} population {{figure for}} Uxbridge North {{was recorded in}} 2009 by the Office for National Statistics as 11,812, and 11,887 in Uxbridge South. The majority of residents in Uxbridge North were white, with 85% categorised, against 79% for the entire borough of Hillingdon. Uxbridge South also had a majority of white residents, matching the borough figure. In both wards, the remaining percentage {{was made up of}} mixed-race, Asian <b>or</b> <b>Asian</b> British, Black or Black British, and Chinese or other ethnic groups. Of the two wards, Uxbridge South had a higher percentage of black and Chinese residents, when compared with the borough.|$|E
5|$|The {{fish and}} {{bivalves}} {{were found in}} clay which was probably a lagoon, and the dinosaurs and lizards in sand which probably was land, perhaps a beach; turtles and crocodiles were found in both. Freshwater snails were found in clay {{that may have been}} shallow, drying lakes behind a sandy barrier between lagoon and sea, in a setting perhaps similar to the Florida Keys or the southwestern coast of Jutland. Dinosaurs may have fed there, based on the remains of plants and small land animals, and theropods may have hunted along the shore. Bornholm and Scania appear to be the only places were remains of the Scandinavian-Russian fauna of the Early Cretaceous can be found. Further investigations there may show whether this fauna has European <b>or</b> <b>Asian</b> affinities.|$|E

25|$|Under the 1961 Constitution, the Legislative Assembly had 65 elected members: 50 {{constituency}} {{members and}} 15 district members. The voter rolls had education, property and income qualifications. The main A roll was for citizens who satisfied high standards in these regards and 95% {{of its members}} were white and 5% were black <b>or</b> <b>Asian.</b> The B roll had lower qualification standards and 90% of its members were black and 10% were white <b>or</b> <b>Asian.</b> The B roll was about one-tenth {{of the size of}} the A roll. Both rolls voted in elections for constituencies and districts, but for elections in the constituencies, the B roll vote was capped at 20% of the total, and for elections in the districts, the A roll vote was capped at 20% of the total. This procedure was known as 'cross-voting'. In practice, the 50 constituency members would all be white and the 15 district members would mostly be black.|$|E
