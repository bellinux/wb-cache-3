Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is {{involved}} in Aβ accumulation, whereas <b>occlusal</b> <b>disharmony</b> increases Aβ production in the rat hippocampus. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to investigate the effects of apoE deficiency and <b>occlusal</b> <b>disharmony</b> on Aβ production and spatial memory. Wild-type (WT) (n = 12) and apoE-deficient [ApoE(−/−) ] (n = 12) rats (Sprague-Dawley; 8 weeks old) were used. These rats were randomly divided into four groups of six rats each: two control (C) groups: WT (C-WT) and ApoE [C-ApoE(−/−) ], and two <b>occlusal</b> <b>disharmony</b> (D) groups: WT (D-WT) and ApoE [D-ApoE(−/−) ]. The C group received no treatment for 8 weeks. In the D group, the maxillary molar cusps were cut off for 8 weeks. The spatial memory of rats was assessed according to their behavioral performance in a radial arm maze. In both genotypes of rats, significant differences in the reference memory, Aβ 42 production, β-secretase expression and plasma corticosterone levels were observed between the C and D groups (P < 0. 0125). The levels of Aβ 42 and glucocorticoid receptor in the C-ApoE(−/−) group were also significantly higher than those in the C-WT group (P < 0. 0125). However, no significant differences in these parameters were found between the two genotypes with <b>occlusal</b> <b>disharmony.</b> In conclusion, <b>occlusal</b> <b>disharmony</b> induces cognitive dysfunction and Aβ accumulation in the rat hippocampus, and the effects of <b>occlusal</b> <b>disharmony</b> on Aβ accumulation and cognitive dysfunction were larger than those of apoE deficiency...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Open bite is a multifactorial {{phenomenon}} and no single factor {{can account for}} open-bite. Etiology {{plays an important role}} in diagnosis. Heredity, unfavorable growth patterns, incorrect jaw postoure, are the characteristics of skeletal open bite. Digit sucking. Depending on where the thumb is placed, a number of different types of dental problems can develop. Malocclusions of the late mixed or permanent dentitions, caused by thumb sucking are not self corrected and orthodontic treatment is necessary for their correction. Lymphatic tissue. In order to produce oral respiration, the mandible is postured inferiorly with the tongue protruded and resting against the oral floor. This postural alteration induces dental and skeletal modifications similar to those caused by thumb sucking. This may cause excessive eruption of the posterior teeth, leading to an increase in the vertical dimension of the face and result in development of anterior open bite. Tongue thrust. Tongue habits cause an anterior open bite or they develop secondarily to thumb sucking. In skeletal open bite the tongue habit acts as a secondary factor which helps to maintain or exacerbate the condition. Many orthodontists have had a discouraging experience of completing dental treatment, with what appeared to be good results, only to discover that the case had relapsed because the patient had a tongue thrust swallowing pattern. Conclusion. Dentoalveolar or habitual open bite is caused by habits, which influence the growth and development of dentoalveolar processes and contribute to <b>occlusal</b> <b>disharmonies.</b> Prior to eruption of adult dentition, open bite related to oral habits is usually not a concern as when the habits stop, because the erupting dentition tends to improve spontaneously. Treatment is usually not necessary until permanent teeth erupt (~ 6 years old). ...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Sleep bruxism as nocturnal parafunction, {{also known}} as tooth {{grinding}}, {{is the most common}} parasomnia (sleep disorder). Most tooth grinding occurs during rapid eye movement - REM sleep. Sleep bruxism is an oral habit characterized by rhythmic activity of the masticatory muscles (m. masseter) that causes forced contact between dental surfaces during sleep. Sleep bruxism has been associated with craniomandibular disorders including temporomandibular joint discomfort, pulpalgia, premature loss of teeth due to excessive attrition and mobility, headache, muscle ache, sleep interruption of an individual and problems with removable and fixed denture. Basically, two groups of etiological factors can be distinguished, viz., peripheral (occlusal) factors and central (pathophysiological and psychological) factors. The role of occlusion (occlusal discrepancies) as the causative factor is not enough mentioned in relation to bruxism. Objective. The main objective of this paper was to evaluate the connection between occlusal factors and nocturnal parafunctional activities (<b>occlusal</b> <b>disharmonies</b> and bruxism). Method. Two groups were formed- experimental of 15 persons with signs and symptoms of nocturnal parafunctional activity of mandible (mean age 26. 6 years) and control of 42 persons with no signs and symptoms of bruxism (mean age 26. 3 yrs.). The computerized occlusal analyses were performed using the T-Scan II system (Tekscan, Boston, USA). 2 D occlusograms were analyzed showing the occlusal force, the center of the occlusal force with the trajectory and the number of antagonistic tooth contacts. Results. Statistically significant difference of force distribution was found between {{the left and the right}} side of the arch (L%-R%) (t= 2. 773; p 0. 05), but obtained results directly revealed uneven distribution of the occlusal forces which caused the excessive attrition and mobility of tooth.

40|$|Objectives: Brain-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (BDNF), which {{is produced in}} rat submandibular gland, {{is one of the}} most abundant neurotrophins in the central nervous system. It is generally accepted that <b>occlusal</b> <b>disharmony</b> causes stress. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether occlusal disharmony-induced chronic stress affects BDNF levels and morphology in rat submandibular gland. Design: Eight wks old male Wistar rats (n = 21) were randomly divided into three groups of 7 rats. In a control (C) group, the rats received no treatment for 8 wks. In a molar cusp-less (OD) group, maxillary molar cusps were cut off with a dental turbine at baseline and kept for 8 wks. In a molar cusp-less + recovered cusp (OR) group, maxillary molar cusps were cut off and then were recovered after 4 wks using resin material. After the experimental period, expression of BDNF mRNA and protein as well as histological findings were evaluated in the submandibular glands. The comparisons between the groups were made using the Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction. Results: The OD group showed a significant increase in submandibular gland BDNF mRNA and protein expression after 8 wks, and plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone levels increased in a time-dependent manner. There were no significant differences in BDNF expression in the submandibular glands and in levels of plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone between the OR and C groups.

40|$|Introduction: Occlusal {{trauma is}} defined as an injury {{resulting}} intissues changes within the attachment apparatus as result of occlusalforce(s). Since 1901, when Karolyi reported a possible interactionbetween <b>occlusal</b> <b>disharmony</b> and periodontal alterations, severalstudies have tried to find scientific evidence that corroborates or not this interrelationship. Objective and literature review: In this paper,the authors review the studies that have analyzed traumatic occlusion as a presumed aggravating factor in periodontal disease, {{as well as those}} suggesting possible advantages with the concomitant use of occlusal and periodontal therapies. Even though there are still many doubts to be clarified in order to completely understand the effects of occlusal forces on the periodontium, {{it is well known that}} a functional occlusion is fundamental for the equilibrium of the diverse components of the stomatognathic system, including the periodontal tissues. Conclusion: An occlusal adjustment should be done, whenever it is indicated, as a routine procedure during periodontal treatment. Furthermore, it is evident that additional studies, with more precise and reproducible methodology, are needed in order to clarify the interaction between the occlusion with the periodontal tissues...|$|E

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is used to describe all functional disturbances of the masticatory system. The etiology of TMD is multifactorial, such as <b>occlusal</b> <b>disharmony</b> and emotional stress. The relationship between occlusion and TMD has been highly debated in dentistry, one of the occlusal factors is the occlusal scheme. Occlusal schemes are defined as bilateral canine guidance, unilateral canine guidance, group function and balanced occlusion. However, studies about the relationship of occlusal schemes and the occurrence of the TMD are still limited and remained controversial. Objective: To investigate the relationship of occlusal schemes witht he occurrence of TMD. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Faculty of Dentistry, Uniiversitas Indonesia.

Although autogenous rib grafts have no relevance in the restoration of mandibular bone defects occurring after ablative tumor surgery due to limited bone stock {{and the availability of}} other donor areas, they are a useful surgical alternative following tumor surgery in infants. We here report on a 2, 5, 8, and 15 -year follow-up of four children who were diagnosed with benign tumors of the mandible with osseous destruction at the age of 4, 6, 15, and 18 months, respectively. Histologic diagnoses were melanotic neuroectodermal tumor (n[*]=[*] 2), hemangioendothelioma of the mandible (n[*]=[*] 1), and ameloblastoma (n[*]=[*] 1). Following continuity resection of the mandible, lateromandibular bone defects were restored using autogenous rib grafts. Both clinical and radiologic follow-up visits were performed for all children to assess growth of the facial skeleton and the mandible. One child was already further reconstructed using bone augmentation at the age of 15 years. Cephalometric measurements on panorex films and three-dimensional computed tomographic scans revealed a slight vertical growth excess and transversal growth inhibition of the reconstructed mandible compared with the nonoperated side. Although further growth of rib grafts is difficult to predict and <b>occlusal</b> <b>disharmony</b> may occur due to physiologic maxillary growth and growth of the unaffected mandible, we believe that autogenous rib grafts can be ideally used for the restoration of mandibular continuity defects in newborns and young children.

Materials and Methods: Twenty subjects in the age group of 19 - 35 years, free from temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and <b>occlusal</b> <b>disharmony,</b> with healthy dentition participated in the study. Hanau H 2 (non-arcon type) and Hanau Wide-Vue (arcon type) articulators were programmed for sagittal condylar guidance values using the same protrusive record made in polysiloxane bite registration material with edge to edge degree of protrusion. The resultant values for both the articulators on either side were compared with values obtained from tracing of digital lateral cephalogram using Kodak Dental imaging Window software 6. 6. 3. 0 -C program. The tabulated data were subjected to statistical analysis, ANOVA (Fishers ′F′ test) for group comparison, Tukey′s HSD test for inter-comparison, student′s unpaired ′t′ test for intra-group comparison, and level of significance (P) was calculated using the same. Results: The mean sagittal condylar guidance values of the three different groups were found to be very highly significant (P= 0. 001) and highly significant (P= 0. 002) on the right and left sides respectively. There was a very highly significant difference (P= 0. 001) and highly significant difference (P= 0. 003) between the arcon and non-arcon group on the right and left side respectively. No significant difference was found between the arcon and cephalometric group (P= 0. 284 right, P= 0. 853 left) and a statistically significant difference was found between the non-arcon and cephalometric group (P= 0. 049 right, P= 0. 015 left).

40|$|Mandibular {{asymmetry}} {{secondary to}} unilateral condylar hyperplasia (UCH) or asymmetric mandibular hyperplasia (AMH) {{is common in}} Hong Kong. The aims {{of this study are}} to investigate the roles of medical imaging (single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and conebeam CT (CBCT)) in: (1) investigation of the condylar activity in mandibular asymmetry secondary to UCH and AMH; (2) surgical planning in patients presented with complex asymmetry; and (3) evaluation of the association between asymmetry and patients’ quality of life (QoL) and psychosocial well-beings, and the changes at 1 -year after surgery. (1 a) A retrospective study on mandibular asymmetry by planar scintigraphy was performed in 109 patients to compare UCH and AMH. (1 b) A prospective study on a separate 62 patients with UCH or AMH to compare the condylar activities of each side using SPECT scintigraphy. The quantitative analysis included condylar activity percentage (CA%) and condylar activity ratio (CAR). (1 c) 21 patients with valid cone-beam CT (CBCT) data were selected for correlation analysis with the scintigraphic findings. The results from the 3 studies are summarized as follows: A significant difference in CA% between UCH and AMH in both planar and SPECT scintigraphy. Serial analysis of the scintigraphic data in patients with initially active mandibular asymmetry showed an increase in CAR followed by reduction once the asymmetry had become inactive, while CA% percentile difference showed minimal change. The serial change in CAR was corresponding to the change in condylar activity. Correlation analysis revealed significant association between scintigraphic activity and condylar dimensions. Obvious difference was found between UCH and AMH: UCH showed differences in condylar dimensions and posterior ramus height; and AMH showed morphological differences between the left and right posterior ramus including condyles but without non-significant difference in dimension. (2) An new treatment strategy was developed for patients with complex mandibular asymmetry with the use of steroemodel planning and surgical navigation. A case was used to illustrative this technique achieving excellent result. This combination has greatly facilitated the correction of complex mandibular asymmetry with severe <b>occlusal</b> <b>disharmony.</b> (3) Thirty-two patients who were ready for surgical correction of mandibular asymmetry were recruited for evaluation of the patients’ reported outcome measures. The evaluation was conducted before surgery, 1 - & 6 - week, 3 -, 6 - and 12 -month after surgery using a set of self-administered quality of life and psychosocial questionnaires including SF- 36, OHIP- 14, Orthognathic Quality of Life (OQLQ), Hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS), Satisfaction with life scale (SWLS) and Hope scale. 20 patients with valid pre-surgical CBCT were selected for the correlation analysis. Results showed that patients with mandibular asymmetry were more anxious, depressed and had poor QoL. CT correlation analysis revealed both dental midline deviation and occlusal canting had significant association with OHIP, OQLQ and HADS. Surgical correction could bring significant improvement of QoL (in OHIP 14 and OQLQ) but not the psychosocial well-beings. published_or_final_versionDentistryDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
