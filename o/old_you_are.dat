When {{you left}} the orphan asylum and how <b>old</b> <b>you</b> <b>were,</b> how long <b>you</b> worked in the jute mills, the cannery, the paper-box factory, the laundry--maybe you think I can't do addition. I knew how <b>old</b> <b>you</b> <b>was,</b> even to your birthday." ...|$|R

My {{youth was}} nothing; I was a failure; but for you? no, George, you never can, you never must be <b>old.</b> <b>You</b> <b>are</b> {{the triumph of}} my generation, George, and of our old {{friendship}} too.

6000|$|Ben sat thoughtfully {{for some}} time, and then, {{making all the}} {{preparations}} which Toby knew so well signified a long bit of advice, he said: [...] "Toby, my boy, I've been with a circus, man an' boy, nigh to forty years, an' I've seen lots of youngsters start in just as you re goin' to start in tomorrow; but the most of them petered out, because they got to knowin' more 'n them that learned 'em did. Now, you remember what I say, an' you'll find it good advice: whatever business you get into, don't think you {{know all about it}} before you've begun. Remember that you can always learn somethin', no matter how <b>old</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> an' keep your eyes an' ears open, an' your tongue between your teeth, an' you'll amount to somethin', or my name hain't Ben." ...|$|E

60|$|The {{twins were}} {{by this time}} nearly two years old, when the queen was taken {{suddenly}} ill. All the best doctors in the country were sent for, {{but it was no}} use, for there is no cure for death. The queen knew she was dying, and sent for Dotterine and her nurse, who had now become her lady-in-waiting. To her, as her most faithful servant, she gave the lucky basket in charge, and besought her to treasure it carefully. 'When my daughter,' said the queen, 'is ten years <b>old,</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> to hand it over to her, but warn her solemnly that her whole future happiness depends on the way she guards it. About my son, I have no fears. He is the heir of the kingdom, and his father will look after him.' The lady-in-waiting promised to carry out the queen's directions, and above all to keep the affair a secret. And that same morning the queen died.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, that isn't so. It's I that am <b>old.</b> <b>You</b> <b>ARE</b> young." [...] This {{was what}} she had at first answered--and quite in the tone too of having taken her minutes. It had not been wholly to the point, {{but it had been}} kind--which was what he most wanted. And she kept, for her next words, to kindness, kept to her clear, lowered voice and unshrinking face. [...] "To me too it {{thoroughly}} seems that these days have been beautiful. I shouldn't be grateful to them if I couldn't more or less have imagined their bringing us to this." [...] She affected him somehow as if she had advanced a step to meet him and yet were at the same time standing still. It only meant, however, doubtless, that she was, gravely and reasonably, thinking--as he exactly desired to make her. If she would but think enough she would probably think to suit him. [...] "It seems to me," [...] she went on, [...] "that it's for YOU to be sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please tell me," [...] she said, [...] "did papa, in Rome, {{go to see}} Madame Catherine? He told me {{he would}} if he had time. Perhaps he had not time. Papa likes {{a great deal of}} time. He wished to speak about my education; it isn't {{finished}} yet, you know. I don't know what they can do with me more; but it appears it's far from finished. Papa told me one day he thought he would finish it himself; for the last year or two, at the convent, the masters that teach the tall girls are so very dear. Papa's not rich, and I should be very sorry if he were to pay much money for me, because I don't think I'm worth it. I don't learn quickly enough, and I have no memory. For what I'm told, yes--especially when it's pleasant; but not for what I learn in a book. There was a young girl who was my best friend, and they took her away from the convent, when she was fourteen, to make--how do you say it in English?--to make a dot. You don't say it in English? I hope it isn't wrong; I only mean they wished to keep the money to marry her. I don't know whether it is for that that papa wishes to keep the money--to marry me. It costs so much to marry!" [...] Pansy went on with a sigh; [...] "I think papa might make that economy. At any rate I'm too young to think about it yet, and I don't care for any gentleman; I mean for any but him. If he were not my papa I should like to marry him; I would rather be his daughter than the wife of--of some strange person. I miss him very much, but not so much as you might think, for I've been so much away from him. Papa has always been principally for holidays. I miss Madame Catherine almost more; but you must not tell him that. You shall not see him again? I'm very sorry, and he'll be sorry too. Of everyone who comes here I like you the best. That's not a great compliment, for there are not many people. It was very kind of you to come to-day--so far from your house; for I'm really as yet only a child. Oh, yes, I've only the occupations of a child. When did YOU give them up, the occupations of a child? I should like to know how <b>old</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> but I don't know whether it's right to ask. At the convent they told us that we must never ask the age. I don't like to do anything that's not expected; it looks as if one had not been properly taught. I myself--I should never like to be taken by surprise. Papa left directions for everything. I go to bed very early. When the sun goes off that side I go into the garden. Papa left strict orders that I was not to get scorched. I always enjoy the view; the mountains are so graceful. In Rome, from the convent, we saw nothing but roofs and bell-towers. I practise three hours. I don't play very well. You play yourself? I wish very much you'd play something for me; papa has the idea that I should hear good music. Madame Merle has played for me several times; that's what I like best about Madame Merle; she has great facility. I shall never have facility. And I've no voice--just a small sound like the squeak of a slate-pencil making flourishes." ...|$|E
