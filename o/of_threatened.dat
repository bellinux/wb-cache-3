5|$|Although {{formerly}} {{common in}} its range, the species {{was on the}} brink of extinction in Victoria by 1917.

On the 2007 advisory list <b>of</b> <b>threatened</b> vertebrate fauna in Victoria, this species is listed as near threatened.|$|E

40|$|Three {{studies show}} that {{different}} forms of self-activation have differential influences on the processing of social comparison information. Activating neutral self-conceptions results in defensive processing <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> social comparison information (Study 1). Participants maintain favorable self-evaluations {{in the face of}} upward comparison and rate the upward target of comparison negatively. Activating positive self-conceptions results in nondefensive processing <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> social comparison information (Study 2). Participants endorse negative self-evaluations following upward comparison and rate the upward target of comparison positively. Activating negative self-conceptions maximizes defensive processing <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> social comparison information (Study 3). Participants maintain favorable self-evaluations in the face of upward comparison and rate both upward and downward targets of comparison negatively. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for strategies to maintain self-esteem in the face <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> comparisons...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Threatening health {{messages}} {{that focus on}} severity are popular, but frequently have no effect or even a counterproductive effect on behavior change. This paradox (i. e. wide application despite low effectiveness) may be partly explained by the intuitive appeal <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> communication: {{it may be hard}} to predict the defensive reactions occurring in response to fear appeals. We examine this hypothesis by using two studies by Brown and colleagues, which provide evidence that threatening health messages in the form of distressing imagery in anti-smoking and anti-alcohol campaigns cause defensive reactions. Methods We simulated both Brown et al. experiments, asking participants to estimate the reactions of the original study subjects to the threatening health information (n = 93). Afterwards, we presented the actual original study outcomes. One week later, we assessed whether this knowledge of the actual study outcomes helped participants to more successfully estimate the effectiveness <b>of</b> the <b>threatening</b> health information (n = 72). Results Results showed that participants were initially convinced of the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> health messages and were unable to anticipate the defensive reactions that in fact occurred. Furthermore, these estimates did not improve after participants had been explained the dynamics <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> communication as well as what the effects <b>of</b> the <b>threatening</b> communication had been in reality. Conclusions These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> health messages is intuitively appealing. What is more, providing empirical evidence against the use <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> health messages has very little effect on this intuitive appeal. </p...|$|R

5|$|Freshwater and {{terrestrial}} molluscs appear exceptionally {{vulnerable to}} extinction. Estimates {{of the numbers}} of nonmarine molluscs vary widely, partly because many regions have not been thoroughly surveyed. There is also a shortage of specialists who can identify all the animals in any one area to species. However, in 2004 the IUCN Red List <b>of</b> <b>Threatened</b> Species included nearly 2,000 endangered nonmarine molluscs. For comparison, {{the great majority of}} mollusc species are marine, but only 41 of these appeared on the 2004 Red List. About 42% of recorded extinctions since the year 1500 are of molluscs, consisting almost entirely of nonmarine species.|$|E
5|$|Great white {{pelicans}} on Dyer Island, in the Western Cape {{region of}} South Africa, were culled during the 19th century because their predation {{of the eggs}} and chicks of guano-producing seabirds was seen to threaten the livelihood of the guano collectors. More recently, such predation at South African seabird colonies has impacted on the conservation <b>of</b> <b>threatened</b> seabird populations, especially crowned cormorants, Cape cormorants and bank cormorants. This has led to suggestions that pelican numbers should be controlled at vulnerable colonies.|$|E
5|$|Its {{inaccessible}} {{habitat and}} retiring nature {{mean that the}} snoring rail is rarely seen and little is known of its behaviour. Only the adult plumage has been described, and the breeding behaviour is unrecorded. It feeds on small crabs and probably other small prey such as lizards. Although protected under Indonesian law since 1972, the rail is threatened by habitat loss (even within nature reserves), hunting for food and predation by introduced species; it is therefore evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List <b>of</b> <b>Threatened</b> Species.|$|E

5|$|Loss of nesting {{and feeding}} habitat through the {{draining}} of wetlands, pollution and disturbance, together with hunting and egg {{collection in the}} past has caused a massive decline in the population of this species.

5|$|The County Divisions, {{including}} the Devon and Cornwall County Division, were around 10,000 men strong and assigned {{to defend the}} coastlines <b>of</b> <b>threatened</b> sections of the country, {{including the}} manning of coastal artillery. These divisions were largely static, lacking mobility and also divisional assets such as artillery, engineers, and reconnaissance forces.

5|$|The Dalmatian pelican is {{the rarest}} species with a {{population}} estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 following massive declines in the 19th and 20th centuries. The main ongoing threats include hunting, especially in eastern Asia, disturbance, coastal development, collision with overhead power lines and the over-exploitation of fish stocks. It is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List <b>of</b> <b>Threatened</b> Species as the population trend is downwards, especially in Mongolia where it is nearly extinct. However, several colonies are increasing in size and the colony at the Small Prespa Lake in Greece has nearly 1000 breeding pairs.|$|E

The researcher employs the descriptive qualitative {{as a type of}} the research. The data source of this research is action films and their subtitles. The methods of collecting data are documentation and observation. The techniques of analyzing data of this research are describing the form by referring to linguistic form, analyzing the intention based on speech act theory and describing the politeness pattern by referring politeness strategy. This research shows the variation of the sentence types, the equivalence of intentions and the equivalence of politeness pattern <b>of</b> <b>threatening</b> utterances in action films and their subtitles. The variations of type of sentences are: declarative, imperative, and interrogative. While the sentences form variations are: simple sentence is subtitled into simple sentence, compound sentence is subtitled into complex sentence is subtitled into complex sentence, and complex-compound sentence is subtitled into complex sentence. The intentions <b>of</b> the <b>threatening</b> utterance are: threatening, asserting, showing power/ability, warning, commanding, and encouraging. The politeness pattern is divided into three kinds, they are: Bald on record, Positive Politeness, Negative Politeness, and Off Record Strategy...|$|R
