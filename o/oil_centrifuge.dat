For cold-pressed lemon oil (etheric oil), {{it needs a}} separator specifically designed to handle the delicate nature and value of the <b>oil.</b> A hermetic <b>centrifuge</b> is best for this purpose because it can prevent product contamination and losses.|$|R

30|$|Aliquots of 50  ml of {{distilled}} water {{were added to}} each flask {{at the end of}} the incubation period and these flasks were agitated for 1  h at 30  °C and 200  rpm. The obtained suspension was filtered through gauze pieces, and the remaining liquid was manually squeezed out then added to the filtrate. The whole process was repeated twice (Camilios-Neto et al. 2011). The filtrates were then pooled and centrifuged for 10  min at 10, 000  rpm to collect the supernatant. In case of sunflower seed meal and mixtures containing this substrate, supernatant was found to contain residual oil. Therefore, these supernatants were vigorously shaken with n-hexane 1 : 1 (v/v) to remove residual <b>oil</b> and <b>centrifuged</b> (10, 000  rpm, 10  min) to separate the aqueous and n-hexane phases. This was done to avoid interference during orcinol assay (Kosaric and Vardar-Sukan 2014). The aqueous phase was then used for RL quantification. RL concentrations were expressed first as the product mass per kilogram of initial dry solids (g/kg IDS). In addition, to compare with results obtained in SLF, we expressed RL concentration as grams per liter of impregnating solution added to the solid substrate (g/l IS) (Camilios-Neto et al. 2011).|$|R

However, current commercial obstacle for biodiesel production is uneconomical and impractical due to high feedstock cost. Therefore in this study, decanter cake (DC), waste from oil palm mill {{was used as a}} feedstock for biodiesel production can be a better alternative. DC is a solid waste produced when the crude palm <b>oil</b> is <b>centrifuged</b> for purification where the supernatant is the purer palm oil and the sediment is called the decanter cake. Waste oil which has been classified as low-grade oil usually suffered with high free fatty acids (FFA) content. Catalyst selection has to be made wisely so that it can work for both esterification of free fatty acid which is present in DC-oil, and transesterification of triglycerides. In the present work, a solid acid catalyst comprising SO 4 2 −/TiO 2 –SiO 2 was prepared, characterized and studied for its activity for the production of biodiesel. The silica source was obtained from biomass rice husk ash (RHA) which is available abundantly and low in cost as it also categorized as a waste. In addition, solid asid catalyst, SO 4 2 -/TiO 2 -SiO 2 showed the potential in esterification reaction of decanter cake. About 91 % of methyl ester yield was produced at 13 wt. % catalyst loading, 15 : 1 of methanol ratio to oil and 5 hours reaction at 120 °C...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} in hemp (Canapa Sativa L.) {{in the last}} decade is greatly increased for its multiplicity of uses: food; textile industry; cosmetics and biochemical. In addition, hemp seed oil is a great source of high quality nutrients and has multi-purpose natural remedies and It could be used as edible oil containing about 80 % of essential fatty acids (excellent ratio of omega- 6 to omega- 3). The aim of this study was the optimization of hemp seeds oil mechanical extraction parameters {{in order to have a}} higher oil yield. The hemp variety was Futura 75, cultivated in Castelvolturno (CE), Southern Italy. Harvest has been carried out in September 2016 with a mechanical harvester. The test has been carried out using a mechanical screw press, powered by 2. 2 kW electric motor, using an 8 mm nozzle. The variable parameters were: temperature of extraction (50 °C and 70 °C), measured with a temperature sensor placed on press head; two rotational screw speeds (22 rpm and 32 rpm) and seeds pre-treatment (heated at 50 °C for 1 h in a laboratory oven and not heated). The processed samples weighted 1000 g each. After the extraction, <b>oil</b> was <b>centrifuged</b> at 3500 rpm for 20 minutes with an laboratory centrifuge to determine the yield of pure oil as percentage of extracted oil (g) on the total oil extractable basis. During the tests, the performances of the press has been monitored: initial and final extraction temperatures have been recorded with a RTD (Pt 100) temperature sensor; extraction time has been recorded with a laboratory stopwatch. Results show that the combination of high extraction temperature and slow rotational screw speed has a positive effect on oil yield as well as seeds pre-treatment. Further studies are scheduled in order to evaluate the effect of extraction parameters on oil quality in terms of acidity, sensory profile, volatile compounds and fatty acids composition...|$|R
40|$|The residue in {{sunflower}} oil is a dispersed phase consisting of particulate products grinding sunflower {{seeds in the}} form of particles of the pulp, oil cake, meal, residual quantities of metals, pesticides. In the recycling process they are in the oil in suspension and negatively affect its quality. For research an experimental setup was developed allowing to change the angle of inclination of the filter element. The regularities of filtration were determined without preliminary purification of {{sunflower oil}} by centrifugation and after centrifugation. It is established, the contamination of <b>centrifuged</b> <b>oil</b> in the initial period is 14. 6 times lower. After 10 minutes of treatment, it decreases by 62 %, after 20 minutes – by 79. 4 %. With a 30 -minute treatment, particles of 0. 005 - 0. 1 mm in size are removed to 90 %, which is approximated to the refined oil in terms of contamination. The influence of vibration-acoustic action on sunflower oil during its filtration is shown. At the last stage of production, the peroxide index is reduced to 2 - 3 moles of active oxygen, and after 3 months of storage – from 11. 8 to 7. 7, which according to GOST corresponds to the highest-grade oil.

40|$|Le but de cette étude est de caractériser, à l'échelle du pore, la mouillabilité des roches réservoir, en {{relation}} avec leur géométrie et/ou leur minéralogie. Cette caractérisation se fait, après congélation des échantillons, par l'observation de la distribution des fluides au sein du milieu poreux (saumure et huile brute), en microscopie électronique à balayage. Les expériences ont d'abord été effectuées sur des roches modèles parfaitement mouillables à l'eau, verre fritté et grès naturels. Certains de ces minéraux ont été rendus hydrophobes par greffage de silane. L'étude de ces systèmes a mis en évidence une corrélation entre la mouillabilité et la distribution des fluides. Puis, une roche réservoir (grès argileux de {{la formation}} de Brent, de mer du Nord) connue comme étant de mouillabilité intermédiaire a été étudiée. Un travail précédent (étude de déplacements eau/huile par tomographie X) avait abouti à la conclusion que si ces roches présentaient des hétérogénéités de mouillabilité, l'échelle de ces hétérogénéités devait être inférieure au millimètre. Les études de cryomicroscopie ont montré le caractère hydrophobe de la kaolinite, tandis que les illites, le quartz et les feldspaths sont préférentiellement mouillables à l'eau. L'imbibition spontanée d'huile pourrait ainsi être attribuée à l'existence au sein de la roche d'un réseau de kaolinite, tandis que l'imbibition spontanée de saumure serait due à l'existence d'un second réseau plus ou moins imbriqué avec le premier et constitué des autres minéraux. Un autre cas de roche réservoir a été étudié, à savoir un carbonate du Moyen-Orient. Les mésopores intergranulaires y ont été observés comme étant mouillables à l'huile tandis que les micropores restaient mouillables à l'eau. Dans ce cas, la mouillabilité intermédiaire de ces échantillons s'explique par la géométrie plutôt que par la minéralogie qui est plutôt homogène. Wettability {{is generally considered}} {{to be one of the}} principal parameters influencing the distribution, saturation and flow of fluids in porous media. Reservoir rock wettability has long been approached by overall or indirect methods [1] (capillary pressure or relative permeability curves, contact angle, fluid displacement, etc.). Few studies until now have led to a detailed description of porous media with intermediate wettability. - Is there any evidence of an intermediate behavior of fluids in contact with minerals distributed homogeneously throughout the medium, or is there a heterogeneous distribution of water- and oil-wettabilities within the porous medium?- What influence does the local heterogeneity of the minerals (size, geometry, surface chemistry, etc.) have on fluid distribution [2 to 7]?The answer to these questions requires a microscopic-scale description of saturated porous media [8 to 11]. By using the imaging and analytical capabilities of a scanning electron microscope coupled with a cold stage unit, fluids can be visualized and identified by detection of their natural tracer element (sulfur for oil and chlorine for brine), and their relative distribution within the pore space can be analyzed in terms of wettability. Results presented here illustrate both the interest of the method and its applicability to actual reservoir rocks. Small cores of the chosen porous media were first saturated with brine, flooded to irreducible water saturation by <b>centrifuging</b> in <b>oil,</b> aged in oil for one month and finally flooded to residual <b>oil</b> saturation by <b>centrifuging</b> in brine. Samples were then frozen in nitrogen slush, freeze fractured and coated before being transferred to the cold stage of the microscope for observation. Experiments were first conducted on porous media with controlled wettability : model sintered glass media, natural clean sandstone (Fontainebleau) and clayey sandstones (Vosges, Velaines). All these porous media are naturally water wet. Some of them were treated with alkyltrichlorosilane so as to become oil wet. - The analysis of the relative distribution of fluids within the pore space enables conclusions to be drawn about the wettability of the pore walls. The residual non wetting fluid appears as globules trapped in the center of the pores, while the irreducible wetting fluid appears as films surrounding some grains. Films observed were rather thick (1 to 5 microns) and rare, but this does not exclude the systematic presence of a film less than 0. 1 micron thick, this being the limit resolution in the operating conditions. - The porous media made of spherical glass beads, eroded quartz grains or silica overgrowth with no or low content of clays, have a comparable behavior. - Quartz and feldspars are naturally water-wet; the wettability of the quartz grains is efficiently reversed by silanation. - Illite has a marked affinity for brine even after silanation. - The presence of small size minerals (weathered feldspars and clays) enhances oil entrapment by reducing the pore throats. Experiments were then conducted on actual field cores with intermediate wettability (i. e. spontaneously imbibing both brine and oil), a sandstone and a limestone. Both led to interesting conclusions concerning the origin of their behavior. The main results concerning a sandstone from the North Sea (Brent formation) composed of quartz and feldspar grains, and a high content of clay minerals (mainly kaolinite and some illite) are as follows :- residual oil is systematically associated with kaolinite,- illite and weathered feldspars are always observed associated with brine,- quartz and feldspar grains are preferentially water-wet. In some cases, detrital feldspar grains were observed partially covered by oil. Dissolution roughness then seems to play a role in oil entrapment. The hydrophobic character of this sandstone can then be attributed mainly to the presence of kaolinite and its affinity for oil. Spontaneous imbibition in both crude oil and brine can be interpreted as a consequence of two coexisting networks that are oil- or water-wet : kaolinite on one hand (due to high content, and homogeneous distribution), and essentially quartz, feldspar and illite on the other. A quantitative analysis of phase distribution could confirm this hypothesis. - The difference between the Wettability Index measured for oil and water zone samples could be due to differences in clay distribution (depending on the diagenetic history). For an actual field limestone, cryo-SEM observations of fluid distribution lead to an interpretation of sample behavior during displacement tests. They show that intergranular mesopores are preferentially oil-wet, whilst cement micropores remain water-wet. This points out a wettability heterogeneity at the pore scale, leading to an intermediate wettability on a macroscopic scale and thus demonstrates the importance of pore size and geometry. Wettability alteration could be related to geometric parameters during oil invasion. When oil invaded the initially waterwet pore space, its distribution was controlled by both pore size and prevailing capillary pressure : the largest pores were invaded by oil while the smaller ones remained oil free. Aging then caused adsorption of polar oil compounds on the exposed surface. Spontaneous imbibition of oil could therefore be due to a continuous pore network within the oil-wet intergranular mesopores, whilst spontaneous imbibition of brine could be related to brine circulation in water-wet micropores of the calcitic cement. Cryo-SEM has a resolution below the size of minerals constituting natural porous media. It makes it possible to study in situ the influence of various parameters (pore mineralogy, geometry, surface chemistry, etc.) on wettability. Microscopic studies of oil-brine-rock systems (associated with other imaging techniques such as the X-ray computed tomography) contribute to a better understanding of intermediate wettability causes and can thus explain the macroscopic behavior of some reservoir rocks...|$|R
