This can be done manually, but the validated prefix origin data can also be sent to a supported router using the RPKI to Router Protocol (RFC 6810). Cisco Systems offers native support on many platforms for fetching the RPKI data set and using it in the router configuration. Juniper offers support on all platforms that run version 12.2 or newer. Quagga obtains this functionality through BGP Secure Routing Extensions (BGP-SRx) or a fully RFC-compliant RPKI implementation based on RTRlib. The RTRlib provides an open source C implementation of the RTR protocol and prefix <b>origin</b> <b>verification.</b> The library is useful for developers of routing software but also for network operators. Developers can integrate the RTRlib into the BGP daemon to extend their implementation towards RPKI. Network operators may use the RTRlib to develop monitoring tools (e.g., to check the proper operation of caches or to evaluate their performance).|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} {{scientific}} book devoted to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, which is a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics and is permanently applied in chemistry, physics, molecular biology and in physical astronomy. However, while the principle has been studied for more than 90 years, rigorous theoretical foundations still have not been established and many unsolved problems remain. Following an introduction and historical survey, this book discusses the still unresolved questions around this fundamental principle. For instance, why, according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, are only symmetric and antisymmetric permutation symmetries for identical particles realized, while the Schrödinger equation is satisfied by functions with any permutation symmetry? Chapter 3 covers possible answers to this, while chapter 4 presents effective and elegant methods for finding the Pauli-allowed states in atomic, molecular and nuclear spectroscopy. Chapter 5 discusses parastatistics and fractional statistics, demonstrating that the quasiparticles in a periodical lattice, including excitons and magnons, are obeying modified parafermi statistics. With detailed appendices, The Pauli Exclusion Principle: <b>Origin,</b> <b>Verifications</b> and Applications is intended as a self-sufficient guide for graduate students and academic researchers {{in the fields of}} quantum mechanics, theoretical chemistry, physics, and applied mathematics. It will be a valuable resource for any reader interested in the foundations of quantum mechanics and its applications in areas such as atomic and molecular spectroscopy, spintronics, molecular biology, and applied fields of quantum information...|$|R

In an electronic literature search and review of bibliographies (January 1984 to May 2000) the articles selected included data on sensitivity and specificity for local staging. Subgroup analyses examined the influence of age, prostate specific antigen, tumor grade, hormonal pre-treatment, stage distribution, publication year, department of <b>origin,</b> <b>verification</b> bias, time between biopsy and MR imaging; consensus reading, study design, consecutive patients, sample size, histology preparation, imaging planes, fast spin echo, fat suppression, endorectal coil, field strength, resolution, glucagon, contrast agents, MR spectroscopy, and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Seventy-one articles and five abstracts were included, yielding 146 studies. Missing values were highly prevalent for patient characteristics and study design. Publication year, sample size, histologic gold standard, number of imaging planes, turbo spin echo, endorectal coil, and contrast agents influenced staging performance (p= 0. 05). Due to poor reporting {{it was not possible to}} fully explain the heterogeneity of performance presented in the literature.

In particular, we address the following two issues: • What types of assertions can be used most effectively in the context of object oriented software? How can you discover them and where should they be placed? • During maintenance, both the design and the software are continuously changed. These changes can mean that the original assertions, if present, are no longer valid for the new software. Can we automatically derive assertions for the changed software...|$|R

At the same time, many U. S. farmers are producing these high-quality products but are not using market mechanisms that allow them to take fullest advantage of price premiums. This paper describes a pilot program developed to commercialize an origin-based collective brand for very high quality beef. We hypothesize that, if successful, the program would create potential for cattle producers to take fuller advantage of price premiums often captured elsewhere in the marketing channel. Specifically, the pilot program analyzed two mechanisms for differentiating and marketing very high quality beef: a certification mark (a type of U. S. trademark that links products to their geographic origin) and a USDA Process Verification Program (a federal program that allows producers to provide documented assurances to their customers that a stated set of minimum production standards are met). This paper describes how we identified target markets, defined product specifications and determined potential supply, protected property rights using the U. S. trademark system, prepared documentation for a USDA process verification program, and attempted to commercialize Iowa- 80 Beef. We also discuss the costs and feasibility of small firms or producer groups obtaining and maintaining a certification mark and a process verification program. Finally, we discuss the challenges and lessons learned from attempting to brand and commercialize very high quality beef. certification mark, collective brands, consumer assurance, geographic <b>origin,</b> process <b>verification.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{verification}} of gender eligibility in sporting competition poses a biological and management challenge for sports science and medicine, {{as well as}} for sporting authorities. It has been established that in most sporting events, the strength and power advantage possessed by males {{as a result of the}} virilising action of hormones such as testosterone produce significant advantages in performance. For this reason, males and females compete largely in separate gender categories. Controversies arise as a result of intersex conditions, where the classification of individuals into male or female is complex. The present review provides the historical context to the debate, identifying the <b>origins</b> of gender <b>verification</b> as a means to deter cheating. It describes how various testing methods have been attempted, including physical examinations of genitalia, molecular techniques including genetic screening, and complex multidisciplinary approaches including endocrinological, genetic and gynaecological examination. To date, none appear to have provided a satisfactory resolution to the problem, and appear instead to have unfairly discriminated against individuals as a result of inappropriate application of testing results. Sporting authorities have formulated position stands for the management of such cases, but there is not absolute agreement between them and little evidence to support whether intersex individuals should or should not be allowed to compete in female categories...|$|R
40|$|BGP, the Internet’s {{interdomain}} routing protocol, {{is highly}} vulnerable to routing failures {{that result from}} unintentional misconfigurations or deliberate attacks. To defend against these failures, recent years have seen {{the adoption of the}} Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), which currently authorizes 4 % of the Internet’s routes. The RPKI is a completely new security infras-tructure (requiring new servers, caches, and the design of new protocols), a fact that has given rise to some controversy [1]. Thus, an alternative proposal has emerged: Route <b>Origin</b> <b>Verification</b> (ROVER) [4, 7], which leverages the existing reverse DNS (rDNS) and DNSSEC to secure the interdomain routing system. Both RPKI and ROVER rely on a hierarchy of authorities to provide trusted information about the routing system. Recently, however, [2] argued that the misconfigured, faulty or compromised RPKI authorities introduce new vulnerabilities in the routing system, which can take IP prefixes offline. Meanwhile, the designers of ROVER claim that it operates in a “fail-safe ” mode, where “[o]ne could completely unplug a router verification application at any time and Internet routing would continue to work just as it does today”.

30|$|Sensor {{pattern noise}} (SPN) has been {{recognized}} as a reliable device fingerprint for camera source identification (CSI) and image <b>origin</b> <b>verification.</b> However, the SPN extracted from a single image can be contaminated largely by image content details from scene because, for example, an image edge can be much stronger than SPN and hard to be separated. So, the identification performance is heavily dependent upon {{the purity of the}} estimated SPN. In this paper, we propose an effective SPN predictor based on eight-neighbor context-adaptive interpolation algorithm to suppress the effect of image scene and propose a source camera identification method with it to enhance the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) performance of CSI. Experimental results on different image databases and on different sizes of images show that our proposed method has the best ROC performance among all of the existing CSI schemes, as well as the best performance in resisting mild JPEG compression, especially when the false-positive rate is held low. Because trustworthy CSI must often be performed at low false-positive rates, these results demonstrate that our proposed technique is better suited for use in real-world scenarios than existing techniques. However, our proposed method needs many such as not less than 100 original images to create camera fingerprint; the advantage of the proposed method decreases when the camera fingerprint is created with less original images.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A {{sample of}} 181 wind pollinated families, {{representative}} {{of the range of}} environmental conditions occupied by Douglas-fir in northern California, was used as a basis for studying variation in early height growth, phonology, and seed characteristics. Seedlings were raised at Corvallis, Oregon, in a nursery trial designed to evaluate response to varying levels of moisture stress, Variation in cold hardiness was also assessed growing a period of approximately low winter temperatures. It was demonstrated that seedlings from the coastal fog-belt regioret buds later; grew taller; were less cold hardy; and had less capacity to go dormant in response to moisture stress than did samples from the inner ranges. Coastal samples were also characterized by smaller seeds; slower germination; and seedlings with fewer cotyledons and shorter hypocotyls. Lesser variation patterns associated with source elevation and latitude were apparent. For characteristics related to the annual cycle of growth and dormancy, regional differences were greater in relation to family variation than they were for seed related factors. The adaptive significance of this is considered. Regress ion analyses are presented relating seed weight, and epicotyl length {{at the end of the}} first growing season, to source climate and location; the models are then used to compare results of the present study with previously published data. Finally, implications of the study for Douglas-fir seed movement within Caiifornia, and to exotic planting sites, are discussed, and a procedure for seed lot <b>origin</b> <b>verification</b> suggested...|$|E
40|$|Sensor {{pattern noise}} (SPN) is a noise-like {{spread-spectrum}} signal inherently cast onto every digital image by each imaging device {{and has been}} recognised as a reliable device fingerprint for camera source identification (CSI) and image <b>origin</b> <b>verification.</b> It can be estimated as the noise residual between the image content and its denoised version. However, the SPN extracted from a single image can be contaminated largely by image scene because image edge noise is usually much stronger than the SPN. So the identification performance is heavily dependent upon {{the purity of the}} estimated SPN, especially for small size images because they have less and weaker SPN. Although there are some existing works dedicated to improving the performance of source camera identification, an effective method to eliminate the contamination of image scene and extract an accurate SPN is currently lacking. In this paper, we will propose an edge adaptive SPN predictor based on context adaptive interpolation (PCAI) to exclude the contamination of image scene. Different from most of the existing methods extracting SPN from wavelet high frequency coefficients, we extract SPN directly from the spatial domain with a pixel-wise adaptive Wiener filter, {{based on the assumption that}} the SPN is a white signal. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PCAI method achieves the best receiver operating characteristic (ROC) performance among all of the state-of-the-art CSI schemes on different sizes of images, and has the best performance in resisting JPEG compression (e. g. with a quality factor of 90 %) simultaneously.
