Hindman also commenced a campaign <b>of</b> <b>misinformation</b> designed to mislead Federal authorities about the strength of the state's defenses. He also diverted Texas troops bound for Virginia for use in defense of Arkansas. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear {{that they did not have}} an adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{during this}} time of {{increased}} media publicity of the controversy, public health officials and institutions did little to rebut the concerns and speculative theories being offered. Media attention and polarization of the debate has also been fueled by personal injury lawyers who took out full-page ads in prominent newspapers and offered financial support for expert witnesses who dissented from the scientific consensus {{that there is no}} convincing evidence for a link between thiomersal and autism. Paul Offit, a leading vaccine researcher and advocate, has said that the media has a tendency to provide false balance by perpetually presenting both sides of an issue even when only one side is supported by the evidence and thereby giving a platform for the spread <b>of</b> <b>misinformation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Press {{reports of}} the Amelia Island affair were wildly inaccurate, partly because <b>of</b> <b>misinformation</b> disseminated by MacGregor himself. His sudden departure, he claimed, was because he had sold the island to Aury for $50,000. Josefa gave birth to their first child in Nassau on 9 November 1817, a boy named Gregorio. The owner of the Venus was an ex-captain of the British Corps of Colonial Marines named George Woodbine. He drew MacGregor's {{attention}} to the British Legions being raised by the Latin American revolutionaries in London, and suggested that he could recruit and command such a force himself. MacGregor was excited {{by the idea of}} leading British troops again after years in command of colonials, tribesmen, and miscellaneous adventurers. He sailed for home with Josefa and Gregorio and landed in Dublin on 21 September 1818, and from there made his way back to London.|$|E

25|$|Intelligence {{summaries}} initially did {{not believe}} the INA to be a substantial force or have any purpose more than propaganda and espionage purposes. However, by the end of 1942, they had become aware of trained Indian espionage agents (of the INAs Special services group) who had infiltrated into India for the purpose of collecting intelligence, subversion of the army and the subversion of civilian loyalty. These information were derived to a large extent from some of the agents themselves who gave themselves up to the authorities after reaching India. However, the intelligence was also aware at this point <b>of</b> <b>misinformation</b> being spread about the INA itself by the agents who concealed their purpose and professed to pass on intelligence from local knowledge. More troubling for the military command were the activities of the INA agents in the battle fields of India's eastern frontier in Burma.|$|E

Discovery Channel published an article several months after her disappearance discussing how the high levels of media coverage, including some instances of inaccurate media coverage, have hurt the investigation. A notable example <b>of</b> <b>misinformation</b> was the description of her last known movements. Early reports inaccurately reported that Bobo was dragged into the woods. Clint later clarified that Holly had in fact walked with the man wearing camouflage into the woods, either willingly or by coercion. This clarification led to rumors that Clint had changed his story and was a suspect in his sister's disappearance. Whitney Duncan defended him in an April 17 Twitter statement, stating that he was innocent and not a suspect in the case. Some early sources also erroneously reported that the skull was found on property owned by Zach Adams' family. Her body was found 10 miles away from Adams' property on land owned by the Tubbs family.|$|E

McCowen won the 1982 Evening Standard Theatre Award for best actor for this performance. The production generated [...] "a storm of controversy". In [...] "Stage Nazis: The Politics and Aesthetics of Memory", Robert Skloot described the play as [...] "a rarely articulated fantasy about the causes of genocide" [...] that [...] "test the limits of personal tolerance". He wrote that Steiner was [...] "intentionally provocative" [...] in choosing Hitler for the search party to pursue, and Hampton exploited this by giving the former Führer 25 minutes to present his case.

Fogel asserted that part of the problem was Chang's [...] "lack of training as a historian" [...] and another part was [...] "the book's dual aim as passionate polemic and dispassionate history". Fogel also writes: [...] "Dozens of Japanese scholars are now actively engaged in research on every aspect of the war.... Indeed, we know many details of the Nanjing massacre, Japanese sexual exploitation of 'comfort women,' and biological and chemical warfare used in China because of the trailblazing research" [...] of Japanese scholars.|$|E
500|$|Personal {{accounts}} of the battle frequently magnified an individual's own role or minimised those of rivals.

Not only does a historian {{have to deal with the}} normal problem of a veteran looking back and recalling events as he or she would have liked them to have been, but in some cases outright malice was involved. Nor was this strictly a Russian event, as bickering and sabotage were known amongst the French marshals and their reporting generals. To [...] "lie like a bulletin" [...] was not just a French affair either, with Kutuzov in particular promoting an early form <b>of</b> <b>misinformation</b> that has continued to this day. Further distortions occurred during the Soviet years, when an adherence to a [...] "formula" [...] was the expectation during the Stalin years and for some time after that.
