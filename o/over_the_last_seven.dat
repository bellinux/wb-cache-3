Joyce praised the concert for showing the best of Lewis' vocal abilities. Focussing predominately on songs from Spirit (2007) and Glassheart (2012), the concert was largely acoustic music with a band and string quartet. In particular Joyce praised Lewis' performances of [...] "First Time Ever I Saw Your Face" [...] and [...] "Bleeding Love" [...] which earned her standing ovations, {{in addition to the}} [...] "note perfect" [...] rendition of [...] "Run". Katherine Hollisey-McLean for the Worthing Herald largely agreed, commenting that if anyone expected Lewis to be [...] "belting out song after song" [...] they were right. Hollisey-McLean praised the decisions to switch the song arrangements, for example adding reggae beats to [...] "Better in Time" [...] and performing the acoustic version of [...] "Trouble".

2500|$|Almost {{as soon as}} he {{was drafted}} into the Phillies organization, Buchanan drew {{comparisons}} to Kyle Kendrick, a pitcher who possesses similar attributes, specifically that they are built similarly in terms of height and weight, and that they both are reliable groundball pitchers. Also similar to Kendrick, many fans and others have overlooked Buchanan during his minor league tenure; he did not receive any interview requests during the Reading Phillies' media day in 2012, despite being one of the team's top starting pitchers. An article in The Times Herald asserted, [...] "Most of what gets Buchanan overlooked are the things that get his pitching compared to Kendrick’s: He isn’t overpowering, but he uses a sinker and control on the corners to coax ground balls and keep his team in games. That capability has earned Kendrick 153 starts and 64 wins <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>seven</b> seasons with the Phillies, not to mention a $7.7 million deal in 2014 as he approaches free agency."

50|$|Situated {{within the}} Central Queensland Sandstone Belt, and {{separating}} the Consuelo Tableland and the Great Dividing Range, Carnarvon Gorge's landscapes {{have largely been}} shaped by water erosion. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> twenty <b>seven</b> million years Carnarvon Creek, which winds for over 30 km, has carved down through six hundred metres of stone, exposing rocks from three significant phases of Queensland's geological history including two sedimentary basins, the Bowen and the Surat, and the Buckland Volcanic Province. The youngest rocks {{in the area are}} the igneous basalt rocks of the Buckland volcanic Province which were laid down between 35-27 million years ago to depths of up to 300 metres. The basalt layer is present on top of the high country either side of the Gorge where it protects the landscape from erosion and generates significantly different soils to those derived from the lower sedimentary rocks. Boulders eroded from the basalt layer dominate the Gorge's waterways due to their ability to resist water erosion better than the sedimentary rocks they once overlaid.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Cognitive and metacognitive {{strategies}} appear truly generic skills through {{their ability to}} foster effective learning in an era where the two constants are continuing change and growth in bodies of knowledge. Yet the literature on lifelong learning has rarely acknowledged {{the importance of these}} skills as a vital foundation in a less than surface way, while policy at Australian federal government level seems generally to be rooted in superficial rhetoric. Interestingly, however, more serious attention has been given to effective learning strategies in earlier Vocational Education and Training (VET) documents, probably because VET attracts many less academically able students. After briefly outlining the importance of cognitive and {{metacognitive strategies}} as a basis for effective lifelong learning, this paper examines the changes that have occurred concerning adoption of cognitive and metacognitive skills as a basis for effective lifelong learning at school and post-compulsory education levels <b>over</b> approximately <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>seven</b> years. It is concluded that, while there is evidence of the effectiveness of the teaching of learning-to-learn approaches, policy makers in Australia appear to have little real understanding of the needs for effective policy and do not recognise curriculum and teaching revolutions that need to occur for the ideal of effective lifelong learning to be realised...|$|R

The present study is the first to analyze the SIAH 2 expression pattern at different levels (RNA, protein expression and immunohistochemistry) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We found that SIAH 2 protein expression is significantly enhanced in human lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and squamous cell lung cancer (SCC). Paradoxically, non-significant changes at RNA level were found, suggesting a post-traductional regulatory mechanism. More importantly, an increased correlation between SIAH 2 expression and tumor grade was detected, suggesting that this protein could be used as a prognostic biomarker to predict lung cancer progression. Likewise, SIAH 2 protein expression showed a strong positive correlation with fluorodeoxyglucose (2 -deoxy- 2 (18 F) fluoro-D-glucose) uptake in primary NSCLC, which may assist clinicians in stratifying patients at increased overall risk of poor survival. Additionally, we described an inverse correlation between the expression of SIAH 2 and the levels of one of its substrates, the serine/threonine kinase DYRK 2. Our results provide insight into the potential use of SIAH 2 as a novel target for lung cancer treatment...|$|R
40|$|Five decades ago, lead {{toxicity}} {{in childhood}} was thought in nonlethal cases {{to be without}} residual effect. This misconception was corrected in 1943 by Randolph Byers, who began the modern era of lead neurotoxicology by asserting that lead not only killed cells, but interfered with the normal development of central nervous system neurons.

The temperature index reconstructions show that the late 20 th century was the warmest period in Asia <b>over</b> <b>the</b> past millennium. The temperature field reconstructions illustrate that temperatures in central, eastern, and southern China during the 11 th and 13 th centuries, and in western Asia during the 12 th century, {{were significantly higher than}} those in other regions, and comparable to levels in the 20 th century.

The main finding of the study is that spatial temperature patterns have, on centennial time-scales, varied greatly <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> millennium.
