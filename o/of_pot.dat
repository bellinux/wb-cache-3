5|$|In the inaugural, non-ranking Northern Ireland Trophy, {{he reached}} the quarter-finals before he was {{defeated}} 4–5 by Neil Robertson. In the first three ranking events of the season—the Grand Prix, the UK Championship, and the Malta Cup—{{he reached the}} last 16, losing final-frame matches to Bingham, Robertson, and Graeme Dott, respectively. After his loss to Bingham, he complained about having to play his match on an outside table, given his world champion status. In the revival <b>of</b> <b>Pot</b> Black, a single-frame knockout tournament not staged since 1991, Murphy was defeated in the final by Stevens. Murphy was awarded Sportsman of the Year at the BBC East Midlands Sports Awards in December 2005.|$|E
5|$|Goods {{traffic was}} more substantial, with fruit, hops and timber being sent out and coal being received. The 1937 {{timetable}} showed two down freight workings from Paddock Wood and one conditional working for Goudhurst, {{while in the}} other direction two conditional workings ran from Hawkhurst and one from Goudhurst. These were market trains and carried wagons for Blackfriars Goods attached to freight services at Paddock Wood. The volume of goods carried fell into steep decline after the Second World War as more and more freight was taken to market by road. Coal traffic remained constant as did the transport <b>of</b> <b>pot</b> plants from local nurseries at Flimwell and Wadhurst for F W Woolworth. This was an important source of revenue for the line with one million pot plants a year being transported from Hawkhurst, bringing in around £1,000 per week. Up to four parcels and miscellaneous vans were loaded daily at Hawkhurst and attached to the last train to Tonbridge, with further collections possibly being made at Horsmonden; special services were laid on in the busy period before Mothering Sunday.|$|E
25|$|A coffee {{percolator}} {{is a type}} <b>of</b> <b>pot</b> used to brew coffee. In {{the case}} of coffee-brewing the solvent is water, the permeable substance is the coffee grounds, and the soluble constituents are the chemical compounds that give coffee its color, taste, and aroma. In 1806, Benjamin Thompson Rumford invented the percolating coffee pot with a metal sieve to strain away the grounds.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, the {{political}} landscape that had prevented {{the creation of the}} Pajarito National Park was starting to change. John F.

He was so impressed that he retained Hewett to report to Congress on the archaeological resources of the region.|$|E
25|$|By the 17th century, it {{was common}} for a Western kitchen to contain a number of skillets, baking pans, a kettle and several pots, along with a variety <b>of</b> <b>pot</b> hooks and trivets. Brass or copper vessels were common in Asia and Europe, whilst iron pots were common in the American colonies. Improvements in {{metallurgy}} during the 19th and 20th centuries allowed for pots and pans from metals such as steel, stainless steel and aluminium to be economically produced.|$|E
25|$|Dye {{designed}} the Radrick Farms Golf Course for the University of Michigan in 1962, but the course did not open until 1965. At the time, {{he was using}} the design style of Trent Jones, but after seeing the work of Alister MacKenzie, who {{designed the}} 1931 Michigan course, Dye decided to incorporate features from two greens into his next project. Dye visited Scotland in 1963 and made a thorough study of its classic courses. The Scottish use <b>of</b> <b>pot</b> bunkers, bulkheads constructed of wood, and diminutive greens influenced his subsequent designs.|$|E

Until 1990 they practised pottery in small scale, producing a small kind <b>of</b> <b>pot</b> to take with them on their travels and a second, bigger kind, to leave as supplies in their key camping sites. Today they prefer to obtain metallic pots. When {{they do not have}} matches or lighters, they use special wood (Pausandra trianae) to produce fire. At present time they do not make mirrors with the resin of Trattinickia glaziovii nor stone axes like they did in past times.|$|E
25|$|Pot {{distilled}} gin represents the earliest style of gin, and is traditionally produced by pot distilling a fermented grain mash (malt wine) from barley or other grains, then redistilling it with flavouring botanicals {{to extract the}} aromatic compounds. The fermentation of grain mash produces a neutral alcohol (similar to vodka) that is predominately tasteless except for the iconic ethyl alcohol taste. A double gin can be produced by redistilling the first gin again with more botanicals. Due to the use <b>of</b> <b>pot</b> stills, the alcohol content of the distillate is relatively low; around 68% ABV for a single {{distilled gin}} or 76% ABV for a double gin. This type of gin is often aged in tanks or wooden casks, and retains a heavier, malty flavour that gives it a marked resemblance to whisky. Korenwijn (grain wine) and the oude (old) style of Geneva gin or Holland gin represent the most prominent gins of this class.|$|E
25|$|The {{west coast}} of Little Sark is rocky, {{but there are two}} notable beaches to the north and east. The beach <b>of</b> <b>Pot</b> Bay {{stretches}} along the east coast from north of Brenière to Avocat Point, but this is a minor attraction compared to La Grande Grève, Sark's largest and most popular beach, which lies along the north coast of Little Sark and is normally accessible via steps cut in La Coupée (after a landslip temporarily closed the steps down to the shore a second way down has now (2016) been prepared and is usable). There are also popular swimming spots at the Venus Pool and Adonis Pool. The former (or Venus's Bath, as it is also known), named as such by Victorian artist William Toplis, lies close to the southeasternmost point of Little Sark. Protected and overhung by granite cliffs, it is largely free from prevailing winds and is a fine swimming spot. Completely covered by the sea at high tide, a low tide a circular pool originally some eighteen feet (five metres) deep (recent rockfalls have decreased its depth substantially) is separated from the sea. A smaller pool, Cupid's Bath, is also found nearby. The Adonis Pool is a similar tidal pool, though deeper, larger and less easily accessible than the Venus Pool; it is located close to the southwesternmost tip of Little Sark. The Adonis Pool enjoys longer periods of sunshine then the Venus Pool but is separated from the mainland at anything approaching half tide (the pool is covered by the sea at high tide) by a deep and fast flowing race of water where visitors require experience or careful instruction to cross to the Adonis rock safely.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} half of the decade, three of Presley's soundtrack albums hit number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as [...] "Can't Help Falling in Love" [...] (1961) and [...] "Return to Sender" [...] (1962). ("Viva Las Vegas", the title track to the 1964 film, was a minor hit as a B-side, and became truly popular only later.) But, as with artistic merit, the {{commercial}} returns steadily diminished. During a five-year span—1964 through 1968—Presley had only one top-ten hit: [...] "Crying in the Chapel" [...] (1965), a gospel number recorded back in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release <b>of</b> <b>Pot</b> Luck and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album How Great Thou Art (1967). It won him his first Grammy Award, for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was [...] "arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [...] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs." ...|$|E
500|$|No.3 Squadron was re-formed at RAAF Point Cook, Victoria, on 1July 1925, with Lukis as its Commanding Officer (CO). Over {{the next}} week, {{operating}} DH.9s and S.E.5s, the unit established {{itself at the}} Air Force's newest base, RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales. Alerted to a forthcoming inspection by the Chief of the Air Staff, Group Captain Richard Williams, Lukis {{had the foresight to}} engage in a speedy beautification program at the base, arranging delivery <b>of</b> <b>pot</b> plants and shrubs; the notoriously fastidious Williams concluded the inspection by pronouncing himself [...] "happily surprised... that so much had been done so quickly". For the duration of his tour as No.3 Squadron commander, Lukis doubled as CO of the base. He was promoted squadron leader on 2July 1927, and handed over command to Squadron Leader Harry Cobby on 13January 1930. Lukis served as CO of No.1 Squadron from 1930 to 1934, interrupted in 1931 by a posting to Britain to [...] attend RAF Staff College, Andover. Raised to wing commander, he was placed in charge of No.1 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Station Laverton, Victoria, in 1936. He held command of No.1 Flying Training School at Point Cook from January 1938 to November 1939, receiving appointment as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1938 King's Birthday Honours, and promotion to group captain in July the same year.|$|E

Once the food began to arrive, his opinion changed immediately with a dish of vichyssoise with oysters and caviar showing that White was [...] "on brilliant form". He called his main course <b>of</b> <b>pot</b> roasted pork accompanied by a cuvée vegetables and potatoes with parsley, [...] "as good a main course as I have ever eaten, and I had the sense to be born to extremely rich parents, who kept me gloriously fed from childhood."

John Lanchester dined there for The Guardian, on the second night following the opening, but complained of the cost of the meal which he thought at £60 for three courses including cover charge and VAT made it the most expensive in London. He said that the starter of ravioli of seafood with sauce vierge was [...] "good but not dumbfounding", while the lobster salad suffered from the lobster being slightly chewy. He called both main courses [...] "the business"; they were a saddle of rabbit served with a herb risotto, leeks, asparagus and a rosemary au jus; the other course was ham wrapped sweetbreads, he added were [...] "stupendously good", served with braised lettuice and cep confit. He referred to the desserts as [...] "red-fruit heaven".|$|E
