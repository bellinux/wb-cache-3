These goals were achieved using a mixed-methods approach. Three studies were undertaken. In the first study a concept mapping approach was used to explore <b>the</b> collective views <b>of</b> clients and clinicians in identifying factors in client-clinician interaction that influence hearing aid adoption. Ten audiologists and 13 clients generated 122 statements that formed eight conceptually homogenous clusters <b>of</b> factors. <b>The</b> concepts were: 1) ensuring client comfort, 2) understanding and meeting client needs, 3) client-centered traits and actions, 4) acknowledging client as an individual, 5) imposing undue pressure and discomfort, 6) <b>conveying</b> <b>device</b> information by clinician, 7) supporting choices and shared decision making, and 8) factors in client readiness. In the second study, nine audiologists and 11 clients who participated in the first study rated <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 122 statements. Clients rated <b>the</b> concept <b>conveying</b> <b>device</b> information by clinician more important than audiologists.

Such memory patterns are very useful in stencil computations. <b>The</b> theoretical bandwidth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> memory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Convey</b> is compared with <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> our measurements. <b>The</b> accurate study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> memory subsystem is particularly useful for users when they are developing their application-specific personality. Experiments were performed to measure the bandwidth between the coprocessor and the memory subsystem. The experiments aimed mainly at measuring the reading access speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> memory from Application Engines (FPGAs). Different ways of accessing data were used {{in order to find}} {{the most efficient way to}} access memory. This way was proposed for future work in <b>the</b> <b>Convey</b> HC-x. When performing a series of accesses to memory, non-uniform latencies occur. <b>The</b> Memory Controller <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Convey</b> HC-x in <b>the</b> coprocessor attempts to cover this latency.
