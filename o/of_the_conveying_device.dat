40|$|<b>The</b> purpose <b>of</b> this {{dissertation}} was to gain {{a better}} understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> client-clinician interaction in the hearing aid adoption process. <b>The</b> specific goals <b>of</b> this dissertation were: 1) to identify factors in client-clinician interactions that were perceived by clients and clinicians to influence hearing aid adoption in first time adult hearing aid candidates, 2) to investigate <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identified factors from clients and clinicians perspectives, and 3) to compare <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> identified factors between clients and clinicians. These goals were achieved using a mixed-methods approach. Three studies were undertaken. In the first study a concept mapping approach was used to explore <b>the</b> collective views <b>of</b> clients and clinicians in identifying factors in client-clinician interaction that influence hearing aid adoption. Ten audiologists and 13 clients generated 122 statements that formed eight conceptually homogenous clusters <b>of</b> factors. <b>The</b> concepts were: 1) ensuring client comfort, 2) understanding and meeting client needs, 3) client-centered traits and actions, 4) acknowledging client as an individual, 5) imposing undue pressure and discomfort, 6) <b>conveying</b> <b>device</b> information by clinician, 7) supporting choices and shared decision making, and 8) factors in client readiness. In the second study, nine audiologists and 11 clients who participated in the first study rated <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 122 statements. Clients rated <b>the</b> concept <b>conveying</b> <b>device</b> information by clinician more important than audiologists.

Different ways of accessing data were used {{in order to find}} {{the most efficient way to}} access memory. This way was proposed for future work in <b>the</b> <b>Convey</b> HC-x.
