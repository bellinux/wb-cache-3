25|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} introduce the birds into Mexico in 2008, however due to import restrictions and permits, the plan was delayed. A stock of viable individuals was kept in the U.S., until finally they were transferred to Mexico in 2013. In 2005 plans were outlined to assess the level of soil erosion on Socorro {{as a result of}} vegetation loss. The Mexican Navy claimed to have reduced the sheep population on the island to around 300 with further plans to eradicate all of the sheep on the island between 2008 and 2009. This was accomplished in 2010. Avian Malaria and trichomoniasis were detected during screens other dove populations on neighboring islands in December 2003 and January 2004. As a result, recommendations for protection of the reintroduction population were put forward. In 2008 the Edinburgh and Paignton Zoos sent 12 chicks from their breeding program to the Albuquerque Zoo as part of the collective aggregation effort. In 2006, there was an <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>avian</b> <b>influenza</b> in Europe, and therefore 12 doves were sent to Albuquerque Biological Park to create a separate reserve population. Construction of aviaries on Socorro Island began in 2003 and ended in 2005.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Asian Flu" [...] was a {{category}} 2 flu pandemic <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>avian</b> <b>influenza</b> that originated in China in early 1956 lasting until 1958. It originated from mutation in wild ducks combining with a pre-existing human strain. The virus was first identified in Guizhou. It spread to Singapore in February 1957, reached Hong Kong by April, and US by June. Death toll in the US was approximately 69,800. [...] The elderly were particularly vulnerable. Estimates of worldwide deaths vary widely depending on source, ranging from 1million to 4million.|$|E
2500|$|HPAI A(H5N1) is {{considered}} an avian disease, although {{there is some evidence}} of limited human-to-human transmission of the virus. [...] A risk factor for contracting the virus is handling of infected poultry, but transmission of the virus from infected birds to humans has been characterized as inefficient. Still, around 60% of humans known to have been infected with the current Asian strain of HPAI A(H5N1) have died from it, and H5N1 may mutate or reassort into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. In 2003, world-renowned virologist Robert G. Webster published an article titled [...] "The world is teetering {{on the edge of a}} pandemic that could kill a large fraction of the human population" [...] in American Scientist. He called for adequate resources to fight what he sees as a major world threat to possibly billions of lives. On September 29, 2005, David Nabarro, the newly appointed Senior United Nations System Coordinator for Avian and Human Influenza, warned the world that an <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>avian</b> <b>influenza</b> could kill anywhere between 5 million and 150 million people.

40|$|Scale-free {{model for}} spatio-temporal {{distribution}} <b>of</b> <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>avian</b> <b>influenza</b> Abstract—Traditional models for geographical spread of infectious agents invoke a diffusion mechanism.

We find that the <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>avian</b> <b>influenza</b> follow a scale-free distribution that can accurately model connectivity between outbreaks on a scale-free complex network. We explore possible mechanisms that can generate such complex transmission dynamics. Our results indicate that heterogeneity in both the human and animal populations is insufficient to explain our results. Only when we model the potential transmission pathways between flocks with a scale-free network do we obtain a scale-free distribution <b>of</b> connectivity between <b>outbreaks...</b>|$|R
