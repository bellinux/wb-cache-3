25|$|Some {{of these}} codes took direct {{influence}} from rugby union, or rugby football, {{but all of}} these involved kicking and carrying the ball towards posts, meaning {{that they were in}} direct competition with rugby union. While American, Canadian, and Australian rules football are professional, and so competed for rugby union players' economic attentions, Gaelic football has remained staunchly amateur. The former three also use an <b>oblong</b> <b>ball,</b> superficially similar in appearance to a rugby football.|$|E

5000|$|The Australian Football League {{amended the}} rules {{prior to the}} 2013 season to {{instruct}} the umpires to only bounce the ball {{at the start of}} each quarter and after a goal is scored, and throw the ball vertically upwards at all other times. [...] Previously throw-ups were only used if ground conditions did not allow for the ball to be bounced effectively, or after a bounced ball-up is poorly executed and recalled (skewing {{in such a way that}} only one of the competing ruckmen is able to contest the ball). The skill of being able to bounce an <b>oblong</b> shaped <b>ball</b> vertically upwards on a grass surface is unique to Australian Football and the difficulty has been blamed for deterring some from becoming umpires.|$|R

While Harvard's voluntary absence from the meeting made it hard for them to schedule games against other American universities, it agreed to a challenge to play the rugby team of McGill University, from Montreal, in a two-game series. It was agreed that two games would be played on Harvard's Jarvis baseball field in Cambridge, Massachusetts on May 14 and 15, 1874: one to be played under Harvard rules, another under the stricter rugby regulations of McGill. Jarvis Field was at the time a patch of land at the northern point of the Harvard campus, bordered by Everett and Jarvis Streets to the north and south, and Oxford Street and Massachusetts Avenue to the east and west. Harvard beat McGill in the [...] "Boston Game" [...] on the Thursday and held McGill to a 0-0 tie on the Friday.
