5|$|Polarization {{of voting}} {{patterns}} based <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> {{was evident in}} the eastern provinces. Christianity-based Prosperous Peace Party (PDS) received 14.8 percent of votes in Christian-dominant North Sulawesi and 13 seats overall in the People's Representative Council. Likewise, Muslims were more likely to vote for the PKS in regions where religious conflict has been historically prevalent.|$|E
5|$|The census {{question}} <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> {{has been}} criticised by the British Humanist Association as leading, and other surveys of religion tend to find very different results. The 2015 British Election Survey found 52% of Northerners identified as Christian (22% Anglican, 14% non-denominational Christian, 12% Roman Catholic, 2% Methodist, and 2% other Christian denominations), 40% as non-religious, 5% as Muslim, 1% as Hindu and 1% as Jewish.|$|E

5|$|According to a 2001 {{report from}} The World Factbook by CIA, about 47% of Nigeria's {{population}} is Muslim, 43% are Christians and 10% adhere to local religions. But in some recent report, the Christian population is now sightly {{larger than the}} Muslim population. An 18 December 2012 report <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> and public life by the Pew Research Center stated that in 2010, 49.3percent of Nigeria's population was Christian, 48.8percent was Muslim, and 1.9percent were followers of indigenous and other religions, or unaffiliated. Additionally, the 2010s census of Association of Religion Data Archives has reported that 46.5percent {{of the total population}} is Christian, slightly bigger than the Muslim population of 45.5percent, and that 7.7percent are members of other religious groups.|$|E
5|$|As a {{description}} of the origin of the universe, the Big Bang has significant bearing <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> and philosophy.

5|$|Durkheim had an {{important}} impact {{on the development of}} Anthropology and Sociology, influencing thinkers from his school of sociology, such as Marcel Mauss, but also later thinkers, such as Maurice Halbwachs, Talcott Parsons, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown, and Claude Levi-Strauss. More recently, Durkheim has influenced sociologists such as Steven Lukes, Robert Bellah, and Pierre Bourdieu. His description of collective consciousness also deeply influenced the Turkish nationalism of Ziya Gökalp, the founding father of Turkish sociology. Randall Collins has developed a theory of what he calls interaction ritual chains, which is a synthesis of Durkheim's work <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> with Erving Goffman's micro-sociology. Goffman himself was also deeply influenced by Durkheim in his development of the interaction order.|$|E
5|$|Like much of Tamil Nadu, Tiruchirappalli remains {{prone to}} {{communal}} tensions based <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> and ethnicity. There have been occasional outbreaks {{of violence against}} Sri Lankans. In 2009, the offices of a Sri Lankan airline were attacked in the city. In September 2012, two groups of Sri Lankan pilgrims who had visited the Basilica of Our Lady of Good Health in Velankanni and the Poondi Madha Basilica had their buses attacked in Tiruchirappalli {{by a group of}} Tamil activists. Owing to a series of terrorist attacks in Indian cities since 2000, security has been increased at sites such as Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hitchens, with {{particular}} reference to events which {{occurred in the}} Soviet Union, argues that his brother's verdict <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> is misguided, and that faith in God is both a safeguard against the collapse of civilisation into moral chaos and the best antidote to what he views as the dangerous idea of earthly perfection through utopianism. The Rage Against God received a mostly favourable reception in the media.|$|E

5|$|Sai Baba also {{condemned}} distinction based <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> or caste. It {{remains unclear}} {{if he was}} a Muslim or a Hindu. This, however, was of no consequence to Sai Baba. His teaching combined elements of Hinduism and Islam: he gave the Hindu name Dwarakamayi to the mosque in which he lived, practised both Hindu and Muslim rituals, taught using words and figures that drew from both traditions, and took samadhi in Shirdi. One of his well-known epigrams, Allah Malik (God is King) and Sabka Malik Ek (Everyone's Master is One), is associated with both Hinduism and Islam. He is also known to have said Look to me, and I shall look to you.|$|E
5|$|The Binding of Isaacs main {{concept was}} the result of a weeklong game jam that McMillen had with Florian Himsl; at the time, his co-contributor on Super Meat Boy, Tommy Refenes, was on vacation. The concept McMillen had was two-fold: to develop a roguelike title based on the first The Legend of Zelda game's dungeon structure, and to develop a game that {{addressed}} McMillen's thoughts <b>on</b> <b>religion.</b> McMillen had been inspired by Shigeru Miyamoto, the designer of the original Zelda games.|$|E
5|$|The Emperor assured Mary {{that he had}} {{no doubts}} about her loyalty to the Roman Catholic Church. He had learned that the Queen could not easily be bullied, {{especially}} not in matters which affected her personally. Yet, upon leaving the States General in October 1531, Charles gave her a warning, saying that if his parent, wife, child or sibling became a follower of Luther, he would consider them his greatest enemy. Mary was thus forced to suppress Protestantism in the Netherlands, regardless of her own religious tolerance. However, she always strived to enforce her brother's laws <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> as little as possible. She was accused of protecting Protestants on several occasions.|$|E

5|$|Although the country's {{reliance}} on foreign workers {{has been a}} concern to the Saudi government since the mid-1950s, the situation has persisted because of a reluctance by Saudis to take on menial work and a shortage of Saudi candidates for skilled jobs. This has, in part, been blamed on the Saudi education system, which {{has been criticized for}} its emphasis <b>on</b> <b>religion</b> and rote learning. The Saudi economy has, therefore, remained dependent on Westerners for expertise in specialised industries and on the Asian workforce for the construction industry as well as for menial and unskilled tasks. In response, since 1995 the Saudi government has initiated a policy of Saudization, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals. For example, in 2000, it was decreed that the work force of businesses with more than 20 employees must be at least 25 per cent Saudi. In the private sector, there has been a reluctance to employ Saudis and Saudization is generally considered to have been a failure. Saudis themselves may be unwilling to take certain jobs, considering them to lack social value.|$|E
5|$|Bart {{attempts}} to reinspire Krusty by showing him old episodes of the show, but {{he picks up}} on the repetitive nature of his own jokes, and binge drinks in anger. He passes out and has a vision of himself in Jewish Heaven, where he meets Rodney Dangerfield. Rabbi Krustofski then appears and tells Krusty that Jews {{do not believe in}} Heaven, and thus he should do more to help others. An act of kindness does not seem to make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes <b>on</b> <b>religion.</b> Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary.|$|E
5|$|Godwin's books {{begin to}} {{incorporate}} religious themes starting with Father Melancholy's Daughter (1991). The novel is told {{from the perspective}} of multiple characters, each of whom have a different perspective <b>on</b> <b>religion.</b> Father Melancholy's Daughter was followed by several books that centered on the Episcopal church and Christian practices. In these novels female and male characters have a more equal influence on the events and plot than in prior novels. Godwin's books neither evangelize nor mock the practices of the Episcopal Church, but rather treat it as a routine aspect of life, or as a subject of intellectual interest. During these years Godwin's books continued to show father figures who have died or are absent. By 1996 two of her books had fathers that died and five had stepfathers that are depicted as intruding on the mother-daughter relationship.|$|E
