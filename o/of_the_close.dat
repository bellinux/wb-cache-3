5|$|Another proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> {{cooperation}} between uncle and nephew {{in the last}} years of Bolesław the Pious' life is in the events that taken place in mid-1278 (probably in August): Bolesław, using the weakeness of the Margraviate of Brandenburg during the fight between Ottokar II and Rudolph I, in only eight days attacked Neumark and advanced until Myślibórz, where his troops defeated Margrave Otto V the Long.|$|E
5|$|Except for chemicals, {{all of the}} old {{industries}} have disappeared {{and there has been}} diversification, in particular because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> links to the motorway system and the development of warehousing and distribution centres. A new town was built to the east of the existing town in the 1960s and 1970s, and areas of private housing have been established farther to the east; this has resulted in the population more than doubling from around 26,000 to its present level of 70,000.|$|E

5|$|The Close {{owes its}} origins to {{a grant of}} land and {{buildings}} by Walter de Hulle, a canon of Wells Cathedral, {{for the purpose of}} accommodating chantry priests; however the land is likely to have been used for a long period before the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close,</b> as prehistoric flint flakes and Romano-British pottery shards were recovered from the garden of number four during work to construct an extension.|$|E
5|$|The Vicars' Hall was {{completed}} in 1348 and included a communal dining room, administrative offices and treasury of the Vicars Choral. The houses on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> {{were built in the}} 14th and early 15th centuries. Since then alterations have been made including a unified roof, front gardens and raised chimneys. The final part of the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> was during the 1420s when the Vicars' Chapel and Library was constructed {{on the wall of the}} Liberty of St Andrew. The south face includes shields commemorating the bishops of the time. The interior is decorated with 19th century gesso work by Heywood Sumner and the building now used by Wells Cathedral School.|$|E
40|$|Abstract We give a new simple proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NP-hardness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> vector problem.

This is a variant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> vector problem in which the lattice is specified in advance, and can be preprocessed for an arbitrarily long amount <b>of</b> time before <b>the</b> target vector is revealed.

5|$|Following the 15th century Reformation when {{clerical}} {{marriage was}} permitted, larger households {{would have been}} required {{and as a result}} some of the houses were altered and combined by knocking through walls, into larger dwellings. Others had extensions built to the rear. Water supply was originally from two wells, one at each end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close.</b> By 1468 lead pipes had been installed to bring water into the houses, although the wells continued to function until the 19th century. Number 22 is the house which still has most of its original medieval structure as it was originally built.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, Chamakh was {{pursued by}} several {{professional}} clubs {{that wanted to}} obtain his services. He drew interest from Lens, Toulouse, Lorient, and Bordeaux.

Upon his arrival, Chamakh was placed into the club's youth academy. For the 2001–02 season, {{he was promoted to}} the club's Championnat de France amateur 2 team in the fifth division. Chamakh was involved heavily in the campaign of the team, coached by Jean-Louis Garcia. He appeared in 17 matches and scored six goals as the team finished first in their group, thus earning promotion to the Championnat de France amateur.|$|E

5|$|Michael de la Pole {{had been}} {{instrumental}} in the marriage negotiations; he had the king's confidence and gradually became more involved at court and in government as Richard came of age. De la Pole came from an upstart merchant family. When Richard made him chancellor in 1383, and created him Earl of Suffolk two years later, this antagonised the more established nobility. Another member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> circle around the king was Robert de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who in this period emerged as the king's favourite. Richard's close friendship to de Vere was also disagreeable to the political establishment. This displeasure was exacerbated by the earl's elevation to the new title of Duke of Ireland in 1386. The chronicler Thomas Walsingham suggested {{the relationship between the}} king and de Vere was of a homosexual nature, due to a resentment Walsingham had toward the king.|$|E
5|$|Most gods were {{depicted}} in several ways. Hathor {{could be a}} cow, cobra, lioness, or a woman with bovine horns or ears. By depicting a given god in different ways, the Egyptians expressed different aspects of its essential nature. The gods are {{depicted in}} {{a finite number of}} these symbolic forms, so that deities can often be distinguished from one another by their iconographies. These forms include men and women (anthropomorphism), animals (zoomorphism), and, more rarely, inanimate objects. Combinations of forms, such as gods with human bodies and animal heads, are common. New forms and increasingly complex combinations arose in the course of history, with the most surreal forms often found among the demons of the underworld. Some gods can only be distinguished from others if they are labeled in writing, as with Isis and Hathor. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> connection between these goddesses, they could both wear the cow-horn headdress that was originally Hathor's alone.|$|E
5|$|Ohioans post-war {{career was}} {{relatively}} uneventful until 8 October 1936, {{when she ran}} aground near Seal Rock at the Golden Gate, the entrance to San Francisco Bay. Attempts to free the ship were unsuccessful and, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> proximity of the wreck to San Francisco, the grounded Ohioan drew large crowds to watch salvage operations. Angelo J. Rossi, the mayor of San Francisco, toured the wreck on 19 October. Ohioans hulk caught fire in March 1937, and the wreck broke into two pieces in a storm in December. As late as 1939, some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.|$|E
30|$|As can be observed, the Chhabdi Khola {{river basin}} {{is an area}} largely covered by (open and closed) forest (fluctuating at around a little over 60 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total area from 1990 to 2015). There is {{generally}} more open than <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> broadleaved forest in the season during which the classifications were made. There is a strong probability that <b>the</b> percentage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> broadleaved forest class will rise significantly in the monsoon season, since the canopy will get denser in the wetter season (this also applies to the other study areas). <b>The</b> share <b>of</b> open broadleaved forest peaked in 2000 with 41.86 %, while <b>the</b> share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> broadleaved forest was at its lowest. In contrast, while <b>the</b> share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> broadleaved forest peaked in 2010 with 30.77 % <b>the</b> share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> broadleaved forest was at its lowest with 31.35 %.|$|R

5|$|On the {{following}} day, the 2nd Brigade of the 1st Air Cavalry captured the old French fort near Khe Sanh village after a three-day battle. The link-up between the relief {{force and the}} Marines at KSCB took place at 08:00 on 8 April, when the 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment entered the camp. The 11th Engineers proclaimed Route 9 open to traffic on 11 April. On that day, Tolson ordered his unit to immediately make preparations for Operation Delaware, an air assault into the A Shau Valley. At 08:00 on 15 April, Operation Pegasus was officially terminated. Total US casualties during the operation were 92 killed, 667 wounded and five missing. Thirty-three South Vietnamese troops were also killed and 187 wounded. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> proximity of the enemy and their high concentration, the massive B-52 bombings, tactical airstrikes, and vast use of artillery, NVA casualties were estimated by MACV as being between 10,000 to 15,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Only {{a single}} Tyrannosaurus rex {{specimen}} has been conclusively shown {{to belong to}} a specific sex. Examination of B-rex demonstrated the preservation of soft tissue within several bones. Some of this tissue has been identified as a medullary tissue, a specialized tissue grown only in modern birds as a source of calcium for the production of eggshell during ovulation. As only female birds lay eggs, medullary tissue is only found naturally in females, although males are capable of producing it when injected with female reproductive hormones like estrogen. This strongly suggests that B-rex was female, and that she died during ovulation. Recent research has shown that medullary tissue is never found in crocodiles, which are thought to be the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, aside from birds. The shared presence of medullary tissue in birds and theropod dinosaurs is further evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> evolutionary relationship between the two.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{of damage}} to the {{hypoglossal}} nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple slcerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage {{to the left and}} right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing.|$|E

5|$|Some breeds, {{such as the}} American Quarter Horse in Texas and the Morgan {{horse in}} Vermont and Massachusetts, were named as the state horse because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> {{connection}} between {{the history of the}} breed and the state. Others, including the Tennessee Walking Horse and the Missouri Fox Trotter, include the state in the official breed name. School children have been persuasive lobbyists for the cause of some state horses, such as the Colonial Spanish Horse being named the state horse of North Carolina due to the presence of the Spanish-descended Banker horses in the Outer Banks, while others have been brought to official status through the lobbying efforts of their breed registries.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrain of}} the {{peninsula}} {{has much to do}} with the geology of the Aegean Region in general. The peninsula was shaped into its current form over several geological eras with the tectonic merging of Paleozoic schist formations, Mesozoic limestone and marble deposits, and finally the accretion of large clays and other sediments during the Neogene period. This is partly because of Turkey's unstable fault block terrain, and because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> proximity of the Anatolian-Aegean plate boundary, which generates massifs of mountains all across western Turkey. This includes the peninsula and the mountains surrounding the Büyük Menderes River, known collectively as the Menderes Massif.|$|E
5|$|This garment {{instantly}} received significant global media coverage, and {{has been}} cited along with Elizabeth Hurley's black Versace dress {{as one of the}} most high-profile dresses that made the designer Versace a household name. In addition, this dress was described as a turning point in designer Donatella Versace's career after the death of her brother Gianni Versace. It was chosen by the fashion journalist Lisa Armstrong to represent 2000 in the Fashion Museum of Bath's Dress of the Year collection, at which point it was described as a key example <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>close</b> relationship between fashions, celebrities and publicity. Another duplicate is displayed at The Grammy Museum while as of 2015, Lopez still owns the original gown. In 2015, fifteen years since Lopez first wore it, the dress is still inextricably associated with her and Versace.|$|E
