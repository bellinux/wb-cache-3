40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} two {{decentralized}} algo-rithms that aim to achieve uniform lighting {{across the floor}} of an experimental testbed {{under a variety of}} challenges, including cross-illumination effects and external light disturbances. These challenges cause <b>over-illuminations</b> in the environment that result in a waste of energy and discomfort to the occupants. First, a decentralized integral control approach that does not have any communication between the lights is developed and applied to the system. Due to its failure in achieving uniform lighting when the cross-illumination effects are maximized, a new decentralized method called the illumination balancing algorithm (IBA) is developed that takes the local light levels into account when adjusting the light voltages. The stability analysis of the IBA for the full height partitions case of the testbed is shown as well as the regulation problem results where the algorithm successfully balances the illuminations and hence achieves uniform lighting. In order to track a desired light level across the zones, the IBA is augmented with an integral control at an arbitrarily selected control loop. This combined algorithm achieved successful control even in a case where the decentralized integral control failed.

25|$|The Quaternario judges {{focused on}} the {{technological}} aspects of the fenestration design where window angles were calculated to minimize interior glare and reduce interior <b>over-illumination,</b> {{while at the same}} time reducing solar heat loading and subsequent demand for air conditioning as energy conservation techniques. The angled window projections effectively provide permanent sunscreens, obviating any need for interior blinds or shades.|$|E
25|$|Lighting is {{responsible}} for one-fourth of all electricity consumption worldwide, and case {{studies have shown that}} several forms of <b>over-illumination</b> constitute energy wastage, including non-beneficial upward direction of night-time lighting. In 2007, Terna, the company responsible for managing electricity flow in Italy, reported a saving of 645.2 million kWh in electricity consumption during the daylight savings period from April to October. It attributes this saving to the delayed need for artificial lighting during the evenings.|$|E
25|$|To {{provide the}} kind of {{information}} and support people need to invest money, time and effort in energy conservation, {{it is important to understand}} and link to people's topical concerns. For instance, some retailers argue that bright lighting stimulates purchasing. However, health studies have demonstrated that headache, stress, blood pressure, fatigue and worker error all generally increase with the common <b>over-illumination</b> present in many workplace and retail settings. It has been shown that natural daylighting increases productivity levels of workers, while reducing energy consumption.|$|E
25|$|Direct skyglow {{is reduced}} by {{selecting}} lighting fixtures which {{limit the amount of}} light emitted above the horizontal (90° above the nadir). Indirect skyglow produced by reflections from illuminated surfaces is harder to manage; effective methods for limiting it include the use of low-impact lamp types (e.g. amber sources, see above), minimizing <b>over-illumination</b> and inefficient designs or fixtures that spread light where it is not needed. But it has {{to be taken into account}} that, according to late 2010 publications, Italian regions using full cut off lighting only does not increase skyglow. Anyway, light reflected upwards by dark surfaces such as roads or buildings can be considered as minor, so debate about the contribution of indirect skyglow will continue.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{research}} {{on the effects of}} excessive light on the human body suggests that a variety of adverse health effects may be caused by light pollution or excessive light exposure, and some lighting design textbooks use human health as an explicit criterion for proper interior lighting. Health effects of <b>over-illumination</b> or improper spectral composition of light may include: increased headache incidence, worker fatigue, medically defined stress, decrease in sexual function and increase in anxiety. Likewise, animal models have been studied demonstrating unavoidable light to produce adverse effect on mood and anxiety. For those who need to be awake at night, light at night also has an acute effect on alertness and mood.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of using full cutoff roadway lights to combat light pollution {{has also been}} called into question. According to design investigations, luminaires with full cutoff distributions (as opposed to cutoff or semi cutoff, compared here) have to be closer together to meet the same light level, uniformity and glare requirements specified by the IESNA. These simulations optimized the height and spacing of the lights while constraining the overall design to meet the IESNA requirements, and then compared total uplight and energy consumption of different luminaire designs and powers. Cutoff designs performed better than full cutoff designs, and semi-cutoff performed better than either cutoff or full cutoff. This indicates that, in roadway installations, <b>over-illumination</b> or poor uniformity produced by full cutoff fixtures may be more detrimental than direct uplight created by fewer cutoff or semi-cutoff fixtures. Therefore, the overall performance of existing systems could be improved more by {{reducing the number of}} luminaires than by switching to full cutoff designs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Over-illumination</b> is the {{excessive}} use of light. Specifically within the United States, <b>over-illumination</b> is responsible for approximately two {{million barrels of oil}} per day in energy wasted. This is based upon U.S. consumption of equivalent of [...] of petroleum. It is further noted in the same U.S. Department of Energy source that over 30% of all primary energy is consumed by commercial, industrial and residential sectors. Energy audits of existing buildings demonstrate that the lighting component of residential, commercial and industrial uses consumes about 20–40% of those land uses, variable with region and land use. (Residential use lighting consumes only 10–30% of the energy bill while commercial buildings' major use is lighting.) Thus lighting energy accounts for about four or five million barrels of oil (equivalent) per day. Again energy audit data demonstrates that about 30–60% of energy consumed in lighting is unneeded or gratuitous.|$|E
2500|$|In {{certain cases}} an <b>over-illumination</b> {{lighting}} technique may be needed. For example, indirect lighting {{is often used}} to obtain a [...] "softer" [...] look, since hard direct lighting is generally found less desirable for certain surfaces, such as skin. The indirect lighting method is perceived as more cozy and suits bars, restaurants and living quarters. It is also possible to block the direct lighting effect by adding softening filters or other solutions, though intensity will be reduced.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Over-illumination</b> is the {{presence}} of lighting intensity higher than that which is appropriate for a specific activity. <b>Over-illumination</b> was commonly ignored between 1950 and 1995, especially in office and retail environments. [...] Since then, however, the interior design community has begun to reconsider this practice. <b>Over-illumination</b> encompasses two separate concerns: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Over-illumination</b> can {{be reduced}} by {{installing}} occupancy sensors, using natural sunlight whenever possible, turning off lights when leaving a room, or changing the type of lightbulb. <b>Over-illumination</b> does not refer to snowblindness, where high exposure to ultraviolet light causes physical damage to the eye. Too little light, the opposite of <b>over-illumination,</b> is associated with seasonal affective disorder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Over-illumination</b> {{can also}} {{contribute}} to light pollution if stray light can be seen a neighboring property or building. <b>Over-illumination</b> is a topic normally addressed {{in the process of}} building design, whereas light pollution is normally addressed by zoning regulations.|$|E

5000|$|... {{environmental}} stressors (hypo or hyper-thermic temperatures, elevated sound levels, <b>over-illumination,</b> overcrowding) ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Over-illumination</b> {{has been}} linked to various {{negative}} health effects. While some effects might happen because the color spectrum of fluorescent lighting is significantly different from sunlight, other symptoms might be caused by light that is simply too intense. In particular, <b>over-illumination</b> {{has been linked}} to headaches, fatigue, medically defined stress, anxiety, and decreases in sexual function.|$|E
5000|$|Likewise, <b>over-illumination</b> {{can also}} cause stress and anxiety. In fact, natural light was {{preferred}} over purely artificial light by office workers from both eastern and western cultures. [...] In addition, <b>over-illumination</b> can cause medical stress and even aggravate other psychological disorders like agoraphobia. [...] The replacement of natural light with artificial light also decreases task performance under certain conditions.|$|E
5000|$|Fatigue {{is another}} common {{complaint}} from individuals exposed to <b>over-illumination,</b> especially with fluorescent media.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Over-illumination</b> is {{the excess}} supply of light used {{beyond what is}} {{necessary}} for safety and efficiency.|$|E
50|$|To avoid {{spillover}} {{from the}} effects of <b>over-illumination</b> of the main reflector surface and diffraction, a microwave absorber is sometimes employed. This lossy material helps prevent excessive side-lobe levels radiating from edge effects and <b>over-illumination.</b> Note {{that in the case of}} a front-fed Cassegrain the feed horn and feeder (usually waveguide) need to be covered with an edge absorber in addition to the circumference of the main paraboloid.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{there are}} {{ancillary}} reasons why <b>over-illumination</b> might be {{decided to be}} necessary. For example, retail stores with large windows will sometimes stay illuminated overnight {{as a method of}} crime prevention.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the case}} of more {{conventional}} office environments, the techniques in architectural acoustics discussed above may apply. Other solutions may involve researching the quietest models of office equipment, particularly printers and photocopy machines. Impact printers and other equipment were often fitted with [...] "acoustic hoods", enclosures to reduce emitted noise. One source of annoying, if not loud, sound level emissions are lighting fixtures (notably older fluorescent globes). These fixtures can be retrofitted or analyzed to see whether <b>over-illumination</b> is present, a common office environment issue. If <b>over-illumination</b> is occurring, de-lamping or reduced light bank usage may apply.|$|E
50|$|It is {{valuable}} {{to provide the}} correct light intensity and color spectrum for each task or environment. Otherwise, energy not only could be wasted but <b>over-illumination</b> can lead to adverse health and psychological effects.|$|E
50|$|In {{the context}} of {{seasonal}} affective disorder, it may be worth consideration that an additional installation of light tubes increases the amount of natural daily light exposure. It could thus possibly contribute to residents´ or employees´ well-being while avoiding <b>over-illumination</b> effects.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of these}} issues can be readily {{corrected}} with available, inexpensive technology, and with resolution of landlord/tenant practices that create barriers to rapid correction of these matters. Most importantly, public awareness would need to improve for industrialized countries to realize the large payoff in reducing <b>over-illumination.</b>|$|E
50|$|It is too simplistic {{to try to}} {{increase}} energy savings by increasing the size of windows. Daylight <b>over-illumination</b> may cause glare for occupants, causing them to deploy blinds or other window shading devices, and compromising the daylight harvesting system. Even partially deployed venetian blinds can cut energy savings in half.|$|E
5000|$|Hypertension {{effects of}} <b>over-illumination</b> {{can lead to}} {{aggravation}} of cardiovascular disease and erectile dysfunction, which impacts are outcomes of long term cumulative exposure and associated systematic increases in blood pressure. The mechanism of this effect seems to be stress by related upregulation of adrenaline production akin to the fight-or-flight response.|$|E

5000|$|Health effects (or health impacts) are {{changes in}} health {{resulting}} {{from exposure to}} a source. Health effects are an important consideration in many areas, such as hygiene, pollution studies, occupational safety and health, nutrition and health sciences in general. Some of the major environmental sources of health effects are air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination, noise pollution and <b>over-illumination.</b>|$|E
