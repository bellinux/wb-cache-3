5|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was established}} following {{an increase in}} traffic through the northern entrance to Moreton Bay in the 1840s. It was designed by Edmund Blacket in 1854 and established in 1857. Over the years the light source went through several changes, from <b>oil</b> <b>wick,</b> to kerosene, to acetylene gas, to electricity, and finally to solar power. The structures also went through various modifications, the major one being {{an increase in the}} lighthouse height and rebuilding of several structures, in 1928–1930.|$|E
25|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was first}} exhibited on 11 September 1884, the eighteenth to be {{constructed by the}} Queensland Government. The original lamp was an <b>oil</b> <b>wick</b> burner with an intensity of 13,000cd. It was fixed, with revolving panels. Three lighthouse keeper cottages were also constructed, originally located near the lighthouse. A schoolhouse was also established at the point at the same time, which was active until 1922.|$|E
25|$|The {{lighthouse}} {{was recommended}} in February 1876 but {{construction of the}} lighthouse and cottages, by W. P. Clark, started {{more than a year}} later. The structures were ready and the light was lit in late 1878. The original <b>oil</b> <b>wick</b> light was upgraded to kerosene in 1923, to electricity in 1963 and finally converted to solar power in 1993, when the station was demanned.|$|E

40|$|Sugarcane bagasse was {{partially}} acetylated to enhance its oil-wicking ability in saturated environments while holding moisture for hydrocarbon biodegradation. The water sorption capacity of raw bagasse was reduced fourfold after treatment, which indicated considerably increased hydrophobicity {{but not a}} limited capability to hold moisture for hydrocarbon biodegradation. Characterization results by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and surface area analyzer suggested that treated bagasse exhibited enhanced hydrophobicity and surface area. <b>Oil</b> <b>wicking</b> test results indicate that treated bagasse is more effective in <b>wicking</b> <b>oil</b> from highly saturated environments than raw bagasse and suggest that application of this material in remediation of oil spills in highly saturated wetlands is promising...|$|R

500|$|In 1859, {{control of}} the lightstation passed to the Government of Queensland, but it {{continued}} to be managed by the New South Wales Marine Board until {{the formation of the}} Queensland Department of Ports and Harbours in 1862. In 1864 a telegraph office was opened at the Cape. In 1873, the <b>oil</b> <b>wick</b> lamps were replaced with kerosene. During the 1860s and 1870s some further structures were constructed in the station including a schoolhouse (opened in 1879), a stable, and other storage buildings. A telegraph line was constructed during the 1890s, and a Morse lamp visible for [...] was installed in the 1910s. In 1913 the timber parts of the structures, which were damaged by ants, were replaced. A 1911–1913 survey found the light in good shape, though the apparatus was found out of date and needing replacement. This replacement was to be delayed for a long time due to the transfer of all coastal lights to the Commonwealth, occurring officially October 1913, though practically in July 1915. A post office was operated by the light keepers between 1915 and the early 1920s.|$|E

50|$|The current light {{replaced}} a brick tower on {{the point}} itself, integral to the keeper's house, which was erected in 1857. By 1874 the Lighthouse Board complained that {{the extent of the}} shoal and the poor equipment of the lighthouse made a new light necessary; appropriations were not forthcoming, however, until 1882. The whole gamut of light sources has been run, from <b>oil</b> <b>wicks</b> to incandescent <b>oil</b> vapor (1913) to electricity (1929). The characteristic changed from flashing to fixed and back to flashing along with the change in light source. The present light is powered by a pair of solar panels attached to the roof on the south side.|$|R
50|$|A {{ring oiler}} {{is a simple}} device, {{consisting}} of a large metal ring placed around a horizontal shaft, adjacent to a bearing. An oil sump is underneath this shaft and the ring {{is large enough to}} dip into the oil. As the shaft rotates, the ring is carried round with it. The rotating ring in turn picks up some oil and deposits it onto the shaft, from where it flows sideways and lubricates the bearings. The oil ring is effectively a simple lubrication pump, with only one moving part and no complex or high-precision components. The device is crude, but automatic, effective and reliable. Unlike a drip oiler, there is also no need to close off the oiler or remove <b>oil</b> <b>wicks</b> when the machine is stopped.|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} apparatus comprised {{a fourth}} order lens with an <b>oil</b> <b>wick</b> burner of 4,000cd intensity. Like other lighthouses {{at that time}} it used a clockwork mechanism with weights, {{which had to be}} wound periodically. Due to its short height, only [...] from the base to the lantern, the mechanism had to be wound every 75 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Plans for a {{lighthouse}} and cottages were prepared in early 1874 {{by the office}} of F. D. G. Stanley, Queensland Colonial Architect, with an estimated cost of £1460 for the lighthouse and cottages. The lighthouse, a typical Queensland timber framed and iron clad structure, was to be prefabricated and built in Brisbane. However, the only response to the first tender was an overpriced offer of £2850. The second tender was more successful, the winning offer being by James Midson for £1046/10/-. The construction was completed some time in October 1874, and an additional contract was granted to Midson for the erection of the structures on the site for the sum of £753. Quite remarkably, a last minute change in the order of the lantern from England meant that no lamp room was ordered. An urgent request for an additional £180 was made by Stanley for construction of a lamp room from timber framing with iron plating, instead of the planned cast iron one. The lighthouse was operational around late July 1875. The original light source was an <b>oil</b> <b>wick</b> burner. [...] An 1895 survey also reports two additional auxiliary lights on Cape Capricorn, to the north and southeast of the main lighthouse.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, Puget built a {{computer}} submerged in mineral oil. [...] The project {{was inspired by}} similar computers submerged in vegetable oil, which provides very even cooling but has the disadvantages of being translucent yellow and going rancid after a few months. The mineral oil used for this project is clear and does not decay. Oil has a high specific heat capacity, so it takes this computer approximately twelve hours of operation to reach its peak temperature of eighty degrees Celsius. A radiator and pump can be attached to lower the temperature significantly. After {{more than a year}} of reported use, the only minor problem indicated was from <b>oil</b> <b>wicking</b> into peripherals and making a mess. While Puget does not sell mineral oil computers, they provide a construction tutorial on their website.|$|R

2500|$|A {{station on}} Low Island was {{established}} 1874. A recommendation {{for the construction}} of a permanent lighthouse was made in February 1876 by Commander George Poynter Heath, the first Portmaster of Queensland and the Chairman of the Queensland Marine Board, Commander George Heath, in a letter to the Colonial Treasurer. While the recommendation was accepted for immediate action, the preparation of plans for the lighthouse was delayed from an unknown reason and tenders were called in March 1877. The contract, for £3,195, was awarded in May 1877 to W. P. Clark, who already constructed Queensland's first lighthouse since the separation, Bustard Head Light, in 1868, and who was later to be awarded the contracts for Cape Cleveland Light and Dent Island Light (1878), Double Island Point Light (1884) and Pine Islet Light (1885). Clark committed to completing the lighthouse and cottages in seven months, starting in June 1877. Constructed commenced in Brisbane in July 1877 and by December 1877 the lighthouse was being moved to Low Island. Construction completed by August of that year and light was finally displayed on 17 September 1878. The lens was a Chance Brothers 3rd order (500mm focal length) revolving dioptric supported by a roller bearing pedestal and the characteristic mentioned was [...] "attains its greatest brilliancy every minute", with visibility of [...] The tower was painted white. [...] The original light source was <b>oil</b> <b>wick</b> burners with an intensity of 13,000cd.

Number two in the Court was soon reached; and an inscription on the door-post informing me that Mr. Traddles occupied a set of chambers on the top storey, I ascended the staircase.

The bungalow was a very solid one, but the partition walls of the rooms were almost jerry-built in their flimsiness. Every step or bang of a trunk echoed from my room down the other three, and every footfall came back tremulously from the far walls. For this reason I shut the door. There were no lamps--only candles in long glass shades. An <b>oil</b> <b>wick</b> was set in the bathroom.|$|E
