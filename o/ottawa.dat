5|$|Explorer Samuel de Champlain was {{the first}} European to record an {{encounter}} with <b>Ottawa</b> speakers when he met a party of three hundred Ottawas in 1615 {{on the north shore}} of Georgian Bay. French missionaries, particularly members of the Society of Jesus and the Récollets order, documented several dialects of Ojibwe in the 17th and 18th centuries, including unpublished manuscript <b>Ottawa</b> grammatical notes, word lists, and a dictionary. In the 19th century, <b>Ottawa</b> speaker Andrew Blackbird wrote a history of the <b>Ottawa</b> people that included a description of <b>Ottawa</b> grammatical features. The first linguistically accurate work was Bloomfield's description of <b>Ottawa</b> as spoken at Walpole Island, Ontario. The Odawa Language Project at the University of Toronto, led by Kaye and Piggott, conducted field work in <b>Ottawa</b> communities on Manitoulin Island in the late 1960s and early 1970s, resulting in a series of reports on <b>Ottawa</b> linguistics. Piggott also prepared a comprehensive description of <b>Ottawa</b> phonology. Rhodes produced a study of <b>Ottawa</b> syntax, a dictionary, and a series of articles on <b>Ottawa</b> grammar. Valentine has published a comprehensive descriptive grammar, a volume of texts including detailed analysis, as well as a survey of Ojibwe dialects that includes extensive description and analysis of <b>Ottawa</b> dialect features.|$|E

5|$|A {{tradition}} of indigenous literacy in <b>Ottawa</b> {{arose in the}} 19th century, as speakers of <b>Ottawa</b> on Manitoulin Island became literate in their own language. Manitoulin Island Ottawas who were Catholic learned to write from French Catholic missionaries using a French-influenced orthography, while Methodist and Anglican converts used English-based orthographies. Documents written in <b>Ottawa</b> by <b>Ottawa</b> speakers on Manitoulin Island between 1823 and 1910 include official letters and petitions, personal documents, official Indian band regulations, an official proclamation, and census statements prepared by individuals. <b>Ottawa</b> speakers from Manitoulin Island contributed articles to Anishinabe Enamiad ("the Praying Indian"), an Ojibwe newspaper started by Franciscan missionaries and published in Harbor Springs, Michigan between 1896 and 1902.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{standard}} or official writing system for <b>Ottawa,</b> a widely accepted system is used in a recent dictionary of <b>Ottawa</b> and Eastern Ojibwe, a collection of texts, and a descriptive grammar. The same system is taught in programs for Ojibwe language teachers. One of its goals is to promote standardization of <b>Ottawa</b> writing so that language learners are able {{to read and write}} in a consistent way. By comparison, folk phonetic spelling approaches to writing <b>Ottawa</b> based on less systematic adaptations of written English or French are more variable and idiosyncratic, and do not always make consistent use of alphabetic letters. While the modern orthography is used in a number of prominent publications, its acceptance is not universal. Prominent <b>Ottawa</b> author Basil Johnston has explicitly rejected it, preferring to use a form of folk spelling in which the correspondences between sounds and letters are less systematic. Similarly, a lexicon representing <b>Ottawa</b> as spoken in Michigan and another based on <b>Ottawa</b> in Oklahoma, use English-based folk spellings distinct from that employed by Johnson.|$|E

5|$|In 1908–09, the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association became {{completely}} {{professional and}} {{changed its name}} to the Eastern Canada Hockey Association (ECHA). This led to the retirement of several stars, including Ottawa's Harvey Pulford and Montreal's Russell Bowie, who insisted on keeping their amateur status. The Montreal Victorias and Montreal HC founded the Interprovincial Amateur Hockey Union, leaving only <b>Ottawa,</b> Quebec, Montreal Wanderers and Montreal Shamrocks in the ECHA. It was another season of player turn-over for <b>Ottawa.</b> Besides Pulford, <b>Ottawa</b> lost Alf Smith, who formed a competing <b>Ottawa</b> Senators professional team in the Federal League, and Tommy Phillips, who joined Edmonton. The club picked up Bruce Stuart from the Wanderers, Fred Lake from Winnipeg and Dubby Kerr from Toronto. This lineup had a successful season, winning 10 out of 12 games. Walsh led all scorers with 38 goals in 12 games, while Stuart had 22 and Kerr had 20. The season was clinched with a win against the Wanderers on March 3 in <b>Ottawa,</b> 8–3, as <b>Ottawa</b> won the league and Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|In the 1889–90 season, <b>Ottawa</b> HC {{played two}} {{competitive}} games {{but this was}} to increase greatly the next season.

5|$|<b>Ottawa</b> {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the CHA and one of the teams that had {{rejected}} Renfrew. However, after a few poorly attended games showed that fans had no interest in the league, <b>Ottawa</b> and the Montreal Shamrocks abandoned the CHA to join the NHA. <b>Ottawa,</b> the defending Stanley Cup champion and Wanderers' rival, was readily accepted by the NHA. This enabled <b>Ottawa</b> to continue the rivalry with the Wanderers and take in the gate revenues those games provided. The Wanderers won the championship in 1910, and <b>Ottawa</b> won in 1911 and 1915.|$|E
