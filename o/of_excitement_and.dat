5|$|As the two champions {{appeared}} {{they were}} greeted by a frenzy <b>of</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> everyone was on their feet to acclaim the two heroes. It was difficult to recognise them. Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E

25|$|Munro's {{interest}} in speed began {{at an early}} age, riding the family's fastest horse across the farm, despite the complaints of his father. Trips via train to the port at Invercargill were a rare source <b>of</b> <b>excitement,</b> <b>and</b> the arrival of cars, motorcycles and aircraft added to Burt's eagerness to join the world outside his farm.

25|$|Not all bands {{took part}} in Traoré's roots revival. Les Ambassadeurs du Motel formed in 1971, playing popular songs {{imported}} from Senegal, Cuba and France.

Salif Keita, perhaps the most popular singer of the time, defected to Les Ambassadeurs in 1972. This {{was followed by a}} major concert at which both bands performed as part of the Kibaru (literacy) program.

25|$|The true {{identity}} of the discoverers of carbon nanotubes is a subject of some controversy. A 2006 editorial written by Marc Monthioux and Vladimir Kuznetsov in the journal Carbon described the interesting and often-misstated origin of the carbon nanotube. A large percentage of academic and popular literature attributes the discovery of hollow, nanometer-size tubes composed of graphitic carbon to Sumio Iijima of NEC in 1991. He published a paper describing his discovery which initiated a flurry <b>of</b> <b>excitement</b> <b>and</b> could be credited by inspiring the many scientists now studying applications of carbon nanotubes. Though Iijima has been given {{much of the credit}} for discovering carbon nanotubes, {{it turns out that the}} timeline of carbon nanotubes goes back much further than 1991.|$|E
