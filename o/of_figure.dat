On December 10, 2013, Lysacek announced on The Today Show that he would not attempt to qualify for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, due to the labrum injury which he sustained in September.|$|E
5|$|The rink {{was also}} notable for {{its role in}} the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> skating in Canada. It held some of the first competitions in the sport in Canada. During its existence, it was the home of two important clubs, the Victoria Skating Club and the Earl Grey Skating Club. It was the home rink of Louis Rubenstein, considered one of the first world champions of the sport, and also an important organizer.|$|E
5|$|Another common {{low-pass}} design {{technique is}} {{to implement the}} shunt capacitors as stubs with the resonant frequency set above the operating frequency so that the stub impedance is capacitive in the passband. This implementation has a lumped-element counterpart of a general form similar to the filter <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> 6. Where space allows, the stubs may be set on alternate sides of the main line {{as shown in figure}} 7(a). The purpose of this is to prevent coupling between adjacent stubs which detracts from the filter performance by altering the frequency response. However, a structure with all the stubs on the same side is still a valid design. If the stub is required to be a very low impedance line, the stub may be inconveniently wide. In these cases, a possible solution is to connect two narrower stubs in parallel. That is, each stub position has a stub {{on both sides of the}} line. A drawback of this topology is that additional transverse resonant modes are possible along the λ/2 length of line formed by the two stubs together. For a choke design, the requirement is simply to make the capacitance as large as possible, for which the maximum stub width of λ/4 may be used with stubs in parallel on both sides of the main line. The resulting filter looks rather similar to the stepped impedance filter <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> 5, but has been designed on completely different principles. A difficulty with using stubs this wide is that the point at which they are connected to the main line is ill defined. A stub that is narrow in comparison to λ can be taken as being connected on its centre-line and calculations based on that assumption will accurately predict filter response. For a wide stub, however, calculations that assume the side branch is connected at a definite point on the main line leads to inaccuracies as this is no longer a good model of the transmission pattern. One solution to this difficulty is to use radial stubs instead of linear stubs. A pair of radial stubs in parallel (one on either side of the main line) is called a butterfly stub (see figure 7(b)). A group of three radial stubs in parallel, which can be achieved at the end of a line, is called a clover-leaf stub.|$|E

5|$|For {{clarity of}} presentation, the {{diagrams}} {{in this article}} are drawn with the components implemented in stripline format. This does not imply an industry preference, although planar transmission line formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established printed circuit board manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using microstrip or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to coaxial cables, twin leads and waveguides, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in integrated circuit designs.|$|E
5|$|Si Ronda is a 1930 silent {{film from}} the Dutch East Indies which was {{directed}} by Lie Tek Swie and starred Bachtiar Effendi. Based on contemporary Betawi oral tradition, it follows the exploits of a bandit, skilled in silat (traditional Malay martial arts), known as Si Ronda. In the lenong stories from which the film was derived, Ronda was often depicted as a Robin Hood type <b>of</b> <b>figure.</b> The production, now thought lost, {{was one of a}} series of martial arts films released between 1929 and 1931. Si Ronda received little coverage in the media upon its release. A second adaptation of the tale, Si Ronda Macan Betawi, was made in 1978.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{works of}} art that exhibit traces {{of the influence of}} the Parthenon frieze belong to the media of vase painting and grave stelae where we may find some echo not just of motifs, themes, poses, but tenor, as well. Direct imitation, and indeed quotation, of the frieze begins to be pronounced around 430 BC. One example, an explicit copy, is a pelike attributed to the Wedding Painter of a youth “parking up” a horse exactly in the manner <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> W25 on the frieze. While those vase paintings that resemble the frieze cluster around 430, the vases that quote the pediments are datable nearer {{to the end of the}} century, giving further evidence of the priority of the sculptural program. More accomplished painters also found inspiration in the sculpture, namely Polygnotos I and his group, especially the Peleus Painter, the Kleophon Painter and the late work of the Achilles Painter. Later painters of talent also managed to capture the mood of eusebeia, or thoughtful piety of the procession, as, for example, on the volute krater of the Kleophon Painter of a sacrifice to Apollo, which shares the quiet dignity of the best of High Classical sculpture.|$|E

5|$|The {{simplest}} {{structure that}} can be implemented {{is a step in}} the characteristic impedance of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a). Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with impedance transformers to produce a filter of higher order. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families (Butterworth, Chebyshev, etc.) by approximating the rational transfer function of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).|$|E
5|$|As in the 1984 Winter Olympics, 17 NOCs won {{at least}} one medal and 11 of them secured {{at least one}} gold medal. The Soviet Union {{returned}} {{to the top of}} the gold medal count with 11, relegating East Germany—which took first place four years earlier—to second place with nine. The Soviet Union also collected the most overall medals (29), including the most bronzes (9). In a repeat of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and mimicking Yugoslavia at the 1984 Winter Games, Canada, as host nation, did not win any gold medal, totalling two silver and three bronze medals. Canadian hopes for a gold rested on the shoulders <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> skater Brian Orser, the reigning World champion and silver medalist at the Sarajevo Games. A tight contest with Brian Boitano of the United States ended with the American taking the Olympic title. Athletes from Norway failed to win any event in Calgary, making this the first and so far only time that the country ended the Winter Olympics without a single gold medal. Italy's two gold medals were won by the same athlete: Alberto Tomba, a first-time Olympian who was crowned Olympic champion in the alpine skiing's slalom and giant slalom events. Ski jumper Matti Nykänen of Finland contributed to three of his nation's four gold medals by winning both individual events (first time by an Olympic ski jumper) and helping his team to win the collective title. The performance of the Swiss athletes ensured their nation's best result at the Winter Games, securing a record number of 15 medals, including a then-record of five gold medals that took 18 years to be improved.|$|E
5|$|The churches {{had three}} aisles, divided by wooden columns, often solomonic columns, carved with twisted fluting {{resembling}} those at St. Peter's baldachin in St Peter's, Rome. Until modern times, {{there were no}} pews so the congregation had to kneel or sit on the floor. A variety of fine pieces of art adorn {{the inside of the}} churches, notably their altars, which are sometimes covered in gold, silver or mica. Especially remarkable are the pulpits made of brightly painted wood and supported by carved sirens. The pulpit in the church of San Miguel de Velasco features motifs derived from local vegetation. Elements specific to the Chiquitos missions exist also in other decorations. The altars of the churches of San Xavier and Concepción include depictions of notable Jesuits together with indigenous peoples. There remain a handful of original sculptures in retablos often depicting Madonnas, the crucifixion, and saints, carved in wood and then painted. These sculptures exhibit a style unique to the Chiquitos region, differing from that of the reductions in Paraguay or the Bolivian highlands. The tradition <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> carving has been preserved to the present day in workshops where carvers make columns, finials and windows for new or restored churches or chapels in the area. In addition, carvers produce decorative angels and other figures for the tourist market.|$|E

5|$|The {{frequency}} response behaviour of all mechanical filters {{can be expressed}} as an equivalent electrical circuit using the impedance analogy described above. An {{example of this is}} shown in figure 8b which is the equivalent circuit of the mechanical filter <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> 8a. Elements on the electrical side, such as the inductance of the magnetostrictive transducer, are omitted but would be taken into account in a complete design. The series resonant circuits on the circuit diagram represent the torsional resonators, and the shunt capacitors represent the coupling wires. The component values of the electrical equivalent circuit can be adjusted, more or less at will, by modifying the dimensions of the mechanical components. In this way, all the theoretical tools of electrical analysis and filter design can be brought to bear on the mechanical design. Any filter realisable in electrical theory can, in principle, also be realised as a mechanical filter. In particular, the popular finite element approximations to an ideal filter response of the Butterworth and Chebyshev filters can both readily be realised. As with the electrical counterpart, the more elements that are used, the closer the approximation approaches the ideal, however, for practical reasons the number of resonators does not normally exceed eight.|$|E

This study {{investigates the}} role <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech, mainly metaphors, analogies, and personifications {{in the process}} of conceptual change in the physics classroom. The objectives of this study are as follows: (1) documenting the views of teachers on the role <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech and humor in teaching physics concepts, (2) examining students’ views on the influence <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech on their understanding of physics concepts, (3) observing how students interact with the use <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech and humor in the physics classroom, and (4) investigating the relation between the roles <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech and humor on a motivational and cognitive level. A mixed-method approach was used to conduct this research. Interviews were conducted with physics teachers; questionnaires were distributed to students, and a non-participant observation was carried out during a period of 4 months. A thematic approach was used to analyze the data which provided in-depth knowledge of how teachers and students viewed the roles <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech in teaching physics. Teachers viewed <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech as a VIII tool that helps them transmit abstract physics concepts to students in a simpler and concrete way as well as it helps deal with student misconceptions. The study suggests several ways to overcome the drawbacks and {{make the most of the}} positive aspects. Questionnaires revealed that the majority of students understand physics concepts better when the teacher uses tools such as <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech to explain them. The research highlighted the effective role of teachers in discerning when to use the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> speech and how to overcome its drawbacks when applicable. Non-participant observations enlisted several examples <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech used and the positive responses of students towards them. This study makes an important contribution to using language tools in teaching physics concepts. It highlights the urgent need for all stakeholders to work collaboratively to include <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech in the physics curriculum as tools to enhance the process of conceptual change in the physics classroom. 1 hard copy: xi, 150 leaves; 31 cm. available at RNL...|$|R

In stylistic approach, style can be seen in figurative language through <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech. Thus, the aims of this research are to describe the types <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech and to find out the functions <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech in Les Miserables. This research employed descriptive qualitative approach. The data were in the form of utterances (words, phrases, clauses, and utterances) spoken by the characters in Les Miserables movie. The main instrument of the study was the researcher herself. The researcher employed some steps during the data collection: watching the movie, finding its script, making data sheet, and categorizing the data. In conducting the data analysis, the researcher passed some steps, identifying, classifying, and making interpretation. To gain the data trustworthiness, the researcher asked triangulators to check the data. Using Perrine’s classification <b>of</b> types <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech, this results show that there are eleven types <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech in Les Miserables Movie. They are simile (12 times), metaphor (20 times), personification (22 times), apostrophe (10 times), metonymy (once), synecdoche (7 times), symbol (22 times), paradox (8 times), hyperbole (13 times), irony (16 times), and litotes (10 times). The most often used types <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech are personification and symbol. The character used personification often to depict a story as if this world can execute anything. Meanwhile, the use of symbol was used to represent idea in society. The functions <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech found in the movie are to give imaginative pleasure (105 times), to give additional imagery (86 times), to add emotional intensity (77 times), and to concrete the meaning in a brief compass (60 times). Giving imaginative pleasure is the main function of the use <b>of</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> speech in Les Miserables movie because most figurative language can create pleasure in readers’ mind...|$|R
