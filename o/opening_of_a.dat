5|$|After the Attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Screen Writers Guild {{set up on}} December 8, 1941, the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to {{organize}} writers for the war effort.

His earnings were much greater than in 1937. However, his work for Hollywood Writers Mobilization and for the Communist Party forced him to abandon some partly developed film projects, including The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which John Huston eventually directed in 1948.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} housing projects, a 1955 urban renewal bond issue totaled more than $110 million. The bonds {{provided}} funds to purchase land to build three expressways into downtown St. Louis, which later became Interstate 64, Interstate 70, and Interstate 44. In 1967, the highway-only Poplar Street Bridge opened to move traffic {{from all three}} expressways over the Mississippi River. The openings of the Arch in 1965 and the bridge in 1967 were accompanied by the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new stadium for the St. Louis Cardinals. The Cardinals moved into Busch Memorial Stadium early in the 1966 season. Construction of the stadium required the demolition of Chinatown, St. Louis, ending the decades-old presence of a Chinese immigrant community.|$|E

The branch highway was extended to North Bend after the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Sunset Highway bypass in 1941, using the former mainline road.|$|E

5|$|Canada {{was renamed}} Almirante Latorre {{once again and}} {{formally}} {{handed over to the}} Chilean government on 27 November 1920. It departed Plymouth the same day with two of the destroyers, and they arrived in Chile on 20 February 1921, where they were welcomed by Chile's president, Arturo Alessandri. Almirante Latorre was made the flagship of the navy. The dreadnought was frequently used by Alessandri for various functions, including as transport to Vallenar after a 1922 earthquake, and to Talcahuano for the grand <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new naval drydock in 1924. In 1925, with the fall of the January Junta, the ship hosted Alessandri after his return from exile. In September, the last month of his term, Alessandri received the United Kingdom's Edward, Prince of Wales, on board the battleship.|$|E
5|$|In 1907, to {{mark the}} seventh centenary {{of the birth of}} King James I, Gaudí {{designed}} a monument in his memory. It would have been situated in the Plaça del Rei, and would have also meant the renovation of the adjacent buildings: new roof for the cathedral, as well as the completion of its towers and cupola; placement of three vases above the buttresses of the Chapel of Santa Àgada, dedicated to the Litany of the Blessed Virgin Mary, as well as the figure of an angel on top of the chapel's tower; finally, the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large square next to the walls (now the Plaça Ramon Berenguer el Grand). The project was not executed because the city council disliked it.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations between Smith and Wilson {{took place}} {{throughout}} the rest of the year, but repeatedly broke down; between July and September, a parallel development concerned Rhodesia's <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> representative mission in Lisbon, which Britain opposed, but proved unable to stop. Soon after Smith visited London in October 1965, Wilson resolved to curb his rival's ambitions. During his own visit to Salisbury later that month, he proposed to safeguard future black representation in the Rhodesian parliament by withdrawing control over the Rhodesian parliamentary structure to London. Salisbury had held these powers since 1923. This proved the last straw for Smith's Rhodesian government, which issued the Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) on 11 November.|$|E

5|$|On 14 January 1858, an Italian {{refugee from}} Britain called Felice Orsini {{attempted}} to assassinate Napoleon III with a bomb made in England. The ensuing diplomatic crisis destabilised the government, and Palmerston resigned. Derby was reinstated as prime minister. Victoria and Albert attended the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new basin at the French military port of Cherbourg on 5 August 1858, {{in an attempt}} by Napoleon III to reassure Britain that his military preparations were directed elsewhere. On her return Victoria wrote to Derby reprimanding him for the poor state of the Royal Navy {{in comparison to the}} French one. Derby's ministry did not last long, and in June 1859 Victoria recalled Palmerston to office.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February 1941, Müncheberg was {{informed}} by Gruppenkommandeur Schöpfel that the 7. Staffel had {{to relocate to}} Sicily in support of X.

With the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new front in North Africa in mid-1940, British air and sea forces based on the island could attack Axis ships transporting vital supplies and reinforcements from Europe to North Africa. To counter this threat the Luftwaffe and the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force) were tasked with bombing raids in an effort to neutralise the RAF defences and the ports.|$|E
5|$|On June 21, 1904, the Regents of the University of the State of New York {{consented to}} allow the board of {{trustees}} to authorize the <b>opening</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> law school and a medical school. St. John's College officially became Fordham University on March 7, 1907. The name Fordham refers to the village of Fordham, in which the original Rose Hill campus is located. The village, in turn, drew its name from its location near a shallow crossing of the Bronx River ("ford by the hamlet"). When Fordham and several other Westchester County towns were consolidated into the Bronx {{at the turn of the}} twentieth century, the village became the borough's Fordham neighborhood. Still in existence today, it is just to the west of the Rose Hill campus.|$|E
