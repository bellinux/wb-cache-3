40|$|Aim: To {{present the}} current {{situation}} of dental <b>operating</b> <b>microscopy</b> (DOM) training in the available Advance Specialty Education Programs in Endodontics in Arab Middle-Eastern countries. Materials and Methods: A web-based survey {{was sent to the}} electronic mail address of Advance Specialty Education programs of 15 Arab and middle east countries. The questions were limited to those who have an advanced specialty education program in Endodontics at their University if they are using an operating microscope? Results: Out of 15 countries, only 4 countries have microscopic technology in their Advance Education Programs in Endodontics. Conclusion: Few Arab Middle-Eastern countries have DOM in their advance education programs in endodontics. The highest authority in advancing endodontic education in the Arab Middle-East should consider in the near future the importance of this technology as standard care in teaching advance endodontics. An advance workshops should be organized regularly to provide enough knowledge about this standard educational technology...|$|E
40|$|Objective. In a group case series, the {{clinical}} characteristics of congenital membranous cataract in children were studied {{to establish a}} system of classification and determine the surgical method suited for each type. Methods. Children (18 eyes) with congenital membranous cataract were examined by slit lamp, ultrasound biomicroscopy, and <b>operating</b> <b>microscopy</b> to classify cataracts. The clinical characteristics of congenital membranous cataract and its feature related to the surgical method were analyzed. Results. Five major types of congenital membranous cataracts were classified. All of the surgeries were successful. Anterior and posterior capsulorhexis was performed using Klöti RF capsulotomy tips. The capsular flap was removed, and anterior vitrectomy was performed using a vitrectomy cutter. Postoperative complications included posterior capsule opacification in 16. 7 % of the patients. Conclusion. Ultrasound biomicroscopy was used successfully to classify congenital membranous cataracts prior to surgery. Anterior and posterior capsulorhexis was performed using Klöti RF capsulotomy tips, and capsulectomy was performed using a vitrectomy cutter. These were effective techniques and should be considered for congenital membranous cataract removal surgery. This trial is registered with registration number chiCTR-OOC- 17010913...|$|E

40|$|Driven by {{cost and}} sustainability, {{secondary}} resource {{materials such as}} fly ash, blast furnace slag, and bottom ash are increasingly used for alternative types of concrete binders, such as geopolymers. Because secondary resources may be highly variable {{from the perspective of}} geopolymers, it is often a challenge to upscale these binder types to an industrial scale. This paper describes the testing of a screening method – feature sizing and chemical typing (FS&CT) using an electron microscope – in order to capture the heterogeneity of secondary resources in a quantitative manner. This automated technique is able to simultaneously measure inter particle variations in chemistry (energy dispersive X-ray spectra) and size (shape). Two key variables for application in geopolymers, Si:Al ratio and size, are measured using FS&CT for coal combustion fly ash and its fraction of potentially reactive aluminium-silicate particles. These measurements have been preliminary related to the reactivity of the fly ash in NaOH-solutions with high liquid/solid ratios as well as low liquid/solid ratios (geopolymers).

Diffracted loops show a two-step switching process for external fields along or perpendicular to any of the ring edges. The diffracted loops calculated from micromagnetic simulations reproduce the measured ones and show that the switching occurs from one asymmetric onion state to the reversed state, for both directions of the applied field. In both cases a stable intermediate vortex state appears during the switching, accounting for the diffracted loop structures. The stability and the magnetization chirality of the vortex state depend on the direction of the applied field relative to the ring orientation.

The clue information is deduced when analysing the excitation amplitude A(exc) applied to the piezo shaker in constant amplitude DFM which is strongly affected either by the short-range chemical force or the longer range electrostatic contribution. The latter arises from the bound surface charge within individual ferroelectric domains and results in a long-range tip-sample interaction. From variation of the bias voltage applied to the TGS counter electrode we deduce {{the sign of the}} bound surface charge within each ferroelectric domain.

Results for a tip with negative termination are found not to be compatible with experiments. We demonstrate that theory correctly predicts the trend in contrast changes when varying the tip–surface distance but is also limited in quantitative agreement due to the non-ideal atomic structure of real tips. In a distance range where such peculiarities do not play a major role, however, we find good quantitative agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results.

It is shown that considering only the ballistic photons leads to an under-estimation of the actual out-of-focus distribution of the fluorescence, whereas it is over-estimated when the ballistic and scattered photons are treated alike. Comparison of the in-focus signal to the overall out-of-focus background clearly pointed out that the signal-to-background ratio of TPEF microscopy images benefits from a shortening of the excitation pulses. Moreover, in homogeneously labeled specimen, the background is shown to overcome the signal at imaging depths of about five to six photon mean-scattering paths...|$|R
