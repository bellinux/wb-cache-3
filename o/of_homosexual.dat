5|$|Since 2002, various {{statutory}} {{bodies have}} issued reports calling for recognition <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> and de facto heterosexual relationships.|$|E
5|$|This {{response}} was counter-productive {{in a legal}} sense as it only served to reinforce the charges <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Early {{comic strips}} also avoided overt {{treatment}} of gay issues, though examples <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> subtext have been identified. The 1938–1939 edition of Milton Caniff's Terry and the Pirates features a primary villain, Sanjak, {{who has been}} interpreted {{by some as a}} lesbian with designs on the hero's girlfriend.|$|E
50|$|In 2013, UNAIDS {{conducted}} a survey of 773 Belizeans, ages 18 to 64. The survey found that 34% consider themselves accepting <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals,</b> while another 34% consider themselves tolerant <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals.</b> <b>Of</b> all the Caribbean countries that were polled, Belize and Suriname had the highest percentage <b>of</b> acceptance for <b>homosexuals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Dianne Trilling {{focuses on}} the intersections between gender and {{sexuality}}. Women's sexuality is consistently repressed, and so is that <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals.</b> As such, sexual liberation (<b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> as well) is required for women to be liberated from social norms.|$|R
50|$|The {{umbrella}} organisation dealing with homosexual and bisexual issues is Rosa Lëtzebuerg (Pink Luxembourg). This charity {{was founded on}} 26 June 1996 and had 220 members by 2004. Its aims are to promote the civil rights <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> and bisexuals and to fight against discrimination against them, to work in terms of social, cultural and legal matters for full equality <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> and bisexuals, and to organise social and cultural activities that are in favour <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> and bisexuals.|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the women}} who {{reported}} homosexual activity had not experienced it more than ten times. Fifty-one percent of women reporting homosexual experience had only one partner. Women with post-graduate education had a higher prevalence <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> experience, followed by women with a college education; the smallest occurrence was among women with education no higher than eighth grade. However, Kinsey's methodology was criticized.|$|E
5|$|Starkey is {{an honorary}} {{associate}} of the National Secular Society and an ardent supporter of gay equality movements. A {{supporter of the}} Tory Campaign for Homosexual Equality ("Torche"), during one of many appearances on the BBC's Question Time he attacked Jeffrey Archer over his views on the age <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> consent.|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler's {{sexuality}} {{has long}} been a matter of historical and scholarly debate. There is evidence that he had romantic encounters with a number of women during his lifetime, as well as evidence of his antipathy to homosexuality, and no evidence <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> encounters. His name has been linked to a number of possible female lovers, two of whom committed suicide. Another died of complications eight years after a suicide attempt, and one made a failed suicide attempt.|$|E
5000|$|The Martin-Mitchell defections {{had another}} life inside the U.S. {{intelligence}} community. At {{a meeting of}} the National Security Council in October 1960, officials considered a response to the Martin-Mitchell affair. Attorney General William P. Rogers believed that the Soviets had a list <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> to use in their recruiting and blackmail efforts, that Martin and Mitchell were part of [...] "an organized group". Several at the meeting thought polygraph tests would help prevent the hiring <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals.</b> President Eisenhower himself wanted a central authority to coordinate all government lists <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bisexual actress Marlene Dietrich {{cultivated}} a cross-gender {{fan base}} {{and started a}} trend when she began wearing men's suits. She caused a commotion when she appeared at the premiere of The Sign of the Cross in 1932 in a tuxedo, complete with top hat and cane.Siegel & Siegel, pg. 124. The appearance <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> characters was at its height in 1933; in that year, Hays declared that all gay male characters would be removed from pictures. Paramount {{took advantage of the}} negative publicity Dietrich generated by signing a largely meaningless agreement stating that they would not portray women in male attire.|$|E
5|$|Four {{years later}} public attitudes had changed little. When Ian Harvey, a junior Foreign Office {{minister}} in Harold Macmillan's government, {{was found guilty}} of indecent behaviour with a Coldstream Guardsman in November 1958, he lost both his ministerial job and his parliamentary seat at Harrow East. He was ostracised by the Conservative Party and by most of his former friends, and never again held a position in public life. Thus, anyone entering politics at that time knew that revelations <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> activity would likely bring such a career to a swift end.|$|E
5|$|Kinsey and {{his staff}} {{reported}} that 28% of women had been aroused by another female, and 19% had a sexual contact with another female. Of women who had sexual contact with another female, half to two-thirds of them had orgasmed. Single women had the highest prevalence <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> activity, followed by women who were widowed, divorced, or separated. The lowest occurrence of sexual activity was among married women; those with previous homosexual experience reported they got married to stop homosexual activity.|$|E

5000|$|The sexologist Richard Green {{wrote that}} Sexual Preference {{is one of}} several studies, {{including}} Bieber et al.′s Homosexuality: A Psychoanalytic Study <b>of</b> Male <b>Homosexuals</b> (1962), to have found strained relationships between fathers and homosexual sons. He added that a [...] "gnawing question" [...] in these studies is what percent of heterosexuals give answers more typical <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> and what percent <b>of</b> <b>homosexuals</b> give answers more typical of heterosexuals, and that such [...] "contradictory" [...] outcomes require explanation.|$|R
5|$|Martin {{was also}} wanted in San Francisco in the United States {{for the murder}} <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> prostitute Tom Wenger on 28 March 1994. Wenger's body was chopped up and drained of blood; it {{was found in a}} garbage skip (dumpster) in Myrte Alley in the Polk Street district. Martin's {{photograph}} matched a facial composite picture of a suspect made by San Francisco police, but he was formally eliminated as a suspect after it was established that he was living in a British halfway house {{at the time of the}} murder. He was also investigated for another murder in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|Michael Moorcock {{was one of}} {{the first}} scifi authors to depict {{positive}} portrayals <b>of</b> <b>homosexual,</b> lesbian and bisexual relationships and sex in his novels. For example, in his 1965 novel, The Final Programme, most of the leading characters, including the central 'hero' Jerry Cornelius, engage in same sex relationships on multiple occasions and same sex relationships are depicted as entirely normal and without any moralising, negative consequences or gratuitous titillation, this is the case in the whole Jerry Cornelius series and in Moorcock's fiction generally (particularly in the Dancers at the End of Time series) sexuality is seen as polymorphic and fluid rather than based in fixed identities and gender roles.|$|E
5|$|Gay men {{and lesbians}} came {{together}} to work in grassroots political organizations responding to organized resistance in 1977. A coalition of conservatives named Save Our Children staged a campaign to repeal a civil rights ordinance in Dade County, Florida. Save Our Children was successful enough to influence similar repeals in several American cities in 1978. However, the same year a campaign in California called the Briggs Initiative, designed to force the dismissal <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> public school employees, was defeated. Reaction {{to the influence of}} Save Our Children and the Briggs Initiative in the gay community was so significant that it has been called the second Stonewall for many activists, marking their initiation into political participation.|$|E

5|$|Initially Bryant {{kept her}} {{concerns}} low-key, despite her pastor's pleadings to become involved. She {{wrote a letter}} to the county commission and called Ruth Shack, expressing her concerns. Her most significant objection to the ordinance was that it would allow homosexuals to work in parochial schools; all four of Bryant's children attended a local private Christian school. She admitted she was largely ignorant of any specific dangers homosexuals presented, but when she was sent graphic images <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> acts, and shown photos of child pornography by a local police sergeant visiting her church, she was horrified. Bryant credited her inspiration later to her 9-year-old daughter suggesting God could assist with her cause; then she decided to take a more public role.|$|E
5|$|Records of men {{meeting for}} sex {{with other men}} in bathhouses {{date back to the}} 15th century. A {{tradition}} of public baths dates back to the 6th century BC, and there are many ancient records <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> activity in Greece. In the West, gay men have been using bathhouses for sex since at least the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time when homosexual acts were illegal in most Western countries and men who were caught engaging in homosexual acts were often arrested and publicly humiliated. Men began frequenting cruising areas such as bathhouses, public parks, alleys, train and bus stations, movie theatres, public lavatories (cottages or tearooms), and gym changing rooms where they could meet other men for sex. Some bathhouse owners tried to prevent sex between patrons while others, mindful of profits or prepared to risk prosecution, overlooked discreet homosexual activity.|$|E
5|$|Since medical {{literature}} began to describe homosexuality, {{it has often}} been approached from a view that sought to find an inherent psychopathology as the root cause, influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud. Although he considered bisexuality inherent in all people, and said that most have phases <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> attraction or experimentation, exclusive same-sex attraction he attributed to stunted development resulting from trauma or parental conflicts. Much literature on mental health and lesbians centered on their depression, substance abuse, and suicide. Although these issues exist among lesbians, discussion about their causes shifted after homosexuality was removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. Instead, social ostracism, legal discrimination, internalization of negative stereotypes, and limited support structures indicate factors homosexuals face in Western societies that often adversely affect their mental health.|$|E

5|$|The film {{is mostly}} in English, {{but also has}} some subtitled Yiddish and Hebrew. The film follows the lives of several gay and lesbian Orthodox Jews and {{includes}} interviews with rabbis and psychotherapists about Orthodox attitudes towards homosexuality. During the film's six-year production, DuBowski met hundreds <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> Jews, but only a handful agreed to be filmed due to fear of being ostracized from their communities. Many people who agreed to be interviewed are shown only in silhouette or with their faces pixelized. The {{majority of the participants}} are American Jews, with one British and one Israeli Jew also featured. The film was successful at the box office, grossing over $788,896 on eight screens by its close date.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Göring was {{involved}} in the Blomberg–Fritsch Affair, which led to the resignations of the War Minister, Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg, and the army commander, General Werner von Fritsch. Göring had acted as witness at Blomberg's wedding to Margarethe Gruhn, a 26-year-old typist, on 12 January 1938. Information received from the police showed that the young bride was a prostitute. Göring felt obligated to tell Hitler, but also saw this event as an opportunity to dispose of the field marshal. Blomberg was forced to resign. Göring did not want Fritsch to be appointed to that position and thus be his superior. Several days later, Heydrich revealed a file on Fritsch that contained allegations <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> activity and blackmail. The charges were later proven to be false, but Fritsch had lost Hitler's trust and was forced to resign. Hitler used the dismissals as an opportunity to reshuffle the leadership of the military. Göring asked for the post of War Minister, but was turned down; he was appointed to the rank of field marshal. Hitler took over as supreme commander of the armed forces and created subordinate posts to head the three main branches of service.|$|E
5|$|The {{breeding}} season generally begins in August and September {{with the onset}} of the humid season, but the climate during a particular year may change the timing of breeding. On Cima, W. R. P. Bourne observed females remaining in flocks while males began to take up locations on rocky slopes from which they could sing. The {{breeding season}} is typically long enough that some pairs may be fledging young before others even start to build a nest; the greatest number of pairs breed when rains come, in October to November. Unmated males attract females by calling out beside a prospective nest site. When approached by a female, the displaying male will increase the intensity of his calls and hop around her while crouching with chestnut rump- and shoulder-feathers exposed. The male begins building the nest, but once a pair is formed both birds of the pair participate in the nest's construction and remain close together. Copulation occurs after the nest has been constructed, while the female is dominant in the pair for a time. The male invites the female to copulate by giving the crouching courtship display, and after ignoring and pecking at him initially, the female solicits copulation by crouching herself. When four vagrants were in the Netherlands in May 2013, a male was seen mounting a second male, apparently after the second crouched submissively to resolve a fight between them. This is the only recorded case <b>of</b> <b>homosexual</b> behaviour in sparrows.|$|E
