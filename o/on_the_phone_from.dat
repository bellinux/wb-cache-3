5000|$|The [...] "Lobogate" [...] scandal {{involved}} forged academic transcripts, {{payments made}} for bogus Junior College credits, {{and other devices}} to attain eligibility for players who lacked academic credentials. In an investigation into illegal gambling, the FBI had placed a wiretap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> of a major Lobo booster.

Based <b>on</b> this conversation, <b>the</b> FBI launched an investigation that led to a federal indictment of Ellenberger on seven counts of fraud and forgery of academic transcripts, though he was acquitted of those charges at trial. In July 1981, however, he was convicted by a state District Court on 21 of 22 counts of fraud and submitting false public vouchers. The judge deferred sentence for a year, noting that it was unfair for Ellenberger alone to bear culpability, and all counts were formally dismissed in 1983.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, {{the cost of}} long {{distance}} calling decreased and more business communications were conducted by telephone. As corporations grew and labor rates increased, the ratio of secretaries to employees decreased. With multiple time zones, fewer secretaries and more communication by phone, real-time phone communications were hampered by callers being unable to reach people. Some early studies showed that only 1 in 4 phone calls resulted in a completed call and half the calls were one-way in nature (that is, they did not require a conversation). This happened because people were either not at work (due to time zone differences, being away on business, etc.), or if they were at work, they were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone,</b> away <b>from</b> their desks in meetings, on breaks, etc. This bottleneck hindered the effectiveness of business activities and decreased both individual and group productivity. It also wasted the caller's time and created delays in resolving time-critical issues.|$|R

50|$|Out of the box, the N95 {{supports}} audio in MP3, WMA, RealAudio, SP-MIDI, AAC+, eAAC+, MIDI, AMR, and M4A formats. Its two-way slide, when opened {{towards the}} keypad, allows {{access to its}} media playback buttons.

With the AD-43 headset adapter the N95 introduced support for multiple remote control buttons on the headset. Users can also use Bluetooth for audio output using A2DP, or use the built-in stereo speakers. The N95 is also capable of playing video in 3GP, MPEG4, RealVideo, and, in newer firmware, Flash Video formats. All of the phone's video output can also be played through the TV-out feature. TV-out is a feature offered by the phones OMAP processor, that allows users to connect the smartphone, using the supplied cable, to a TV or any other composite video input.

It's nice to be surprised...Maxine's vision for Chester's Mill is certainly an interesting left turn from the book. We love the idea of a wild frontier town-type thing happening, but we wonder how long that can carry on inside the dome? Is it a temporary thing? Or is Maxine a big bad who is here to stay a while?" [...] Darren Franich of Entertainment Weekly also commented positively on Natalie Zea's character, saying [...] "Max immediately added a whole lot of plot momentum to the show. She convinced Big Jim to round up all the guns so that they/she could be in control. She also revealed that she knew Barbie by giving him a very memorable smooch, and promised to tell Julia about the whole whoops-I-killed-your-husband thing...So basically, Max has only been on the show for an episode, and already she’s A) the most powerful enemy for Big Jim we’ve ever met B) the third corner of a Barbie/Julia romantic triangle, and C) established that she knows all the secrets of everyone in town. More of her, please!" ...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about memory and about narrative, {{both of which}} are {{concerned}} with what is missing. It explores the ways that the events in our individual lives, our collective lives, become history and narrative. The paper considers writer Thomas King’s work on narrative, and Walter Benjamin’s work on memory as theatre. Many of the stories included here are personal. They might have been heard at kitchen tables, or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>from</b> family and friends. Some stories are ones which I can’t recall not knowing. The paper poses questions such as how these things become important to our present. Whether and why it is important to remember, and what constitutes authenticity in memory. The narrative structure of the paper reflects these concerns, by highlighting spaces and absences. To an extent the structure manifested itself organically, as a result of attempts to provide an honest articulation of the questions and ideas which have impacted on my material practice. This {{has proven to be a}} delicate task, as it attempts to speak to a material practice that is ongoing, constantly changing. There are overlaps in the form and content of each but there is also a space in between. My modus operandi resists full disclosure.
