While the observations did not suggest that Gliese 3634 b transited its star, a few <b>orbital</b> <b>parameters</b> were discovered, yielding the planet's true mass, which cannot be collected solely by radial velocity measurements.|$|E

30|$|The {{calculated}} electrodonating, electroaccepting and net electrophilicity {{values of}} the BCPTI and BTPTT inhibitors are listed in Table  2. The energy parameter indicates BCPTI is a better electron donor than BTPTT in gas phase and the <b>orbital</b> <b>parameter</b> indicates BCPTI is also a better electron donor than BTPTT in liquid phase. In contrast to this, the energy parameter indicates BTPTT molecule has a better capability of accepting charge in gas phase and the <b>orbital</b> <b>parameter</b> indicates BTPTT molecule has also a better capability of accepting charge in liquid phase. The total electrophilicity indicates BCPTI is the strongest nucleophile in gas phase if energy parameter is applied and also is the strongest nucleophile in liquid phase if <b>orbital</b> <b>parameter</b> is applied. In contrast to this, BTPTT molecule is the strongest nucleophile in gas phase if <b>orbital</b> <b>parameter</b> is applied and also is the strongest nucleophile in liquid phase if energy parameter is applied. These {{are similar to the}} results obtained by the electrophilicity index. The calculated back-donation (∆E T) {{values of the}} inhibitors are listed in Table  2. This Table shows the back-donation (∆E T) values are similar to global softness values (σ).|$|R

5|$|Because the Earth's axis is tilted {{relative}} to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles {{at different times}} of the year. In June the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, so at any given Northern Hemisphere latitude sunlight falls more directly on that spot than in December (see Effect of sun angle on climate). This effect causes seasons. Over thousands to hundreds of thousands of years, changes in Earth's <b>orbital</b> <b>parameters</b> affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth and influence long-term climate. (See Milankovitch cycles).|$|E

In 1996 a group of Japanese and French astronomers discovered that Pleione is a single-lined spectroscopic binary with an orbital period of 218.0 days and a large eccentricity of 0.6. The Washington Double Star Catalogue lists an angular separation between the two components of 0.2 arcsecondsan angle which equates to a distance of about 24 AU, assuming a distance of 120 parsecs.|$|E

The Voyager1 and Voyager2 probes visited Jupiter in 1979, discovering the volcanic activity onIo {{and the presence of}} water ice on the surface of Europa. The Cassini probe to Saturn flew by Jupiter in 2000 and collected data on interactions of the Galilean moons with Jupiter's extended atmosphere.

30|$|The {{absolute}} hardness and softness are important properties for measuring a molecular stability and reactivity. Table  2 shows that BCPTI {{has a lower}} hardness and a higher softness in gas and liquid phases (except for values obtained by <b>orbital</b> <b>parameter</b> method) which reflect the high reactivity of BCPTI as compared with BTPTT.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of a binary star known only from visual observations, it is not {{possible}} to tell which node is ascending and which is descending. In this case the <b>orbital</b> <b>parameter</b> which is recorded is the longitude of the node, Ω, which is the longitude of whichever node has a longitude between 0 and 180 degrees., chap. 17;, p. 72.|$|R
5|$|Astrometric {{observations}} {{with the}} Hubble Space Telescope measured an inclination of 53° {{of the outer}} planet d, though this result relies on the precise <b>orbital</b> <b>parameters</b> which have been substantially revised since this was published. The observed transits of e suggest an orbit normal inclined within 9° to the line-of-light, and a possible detection of the transit of an extended atmosphere around 55 Cancri b would, if confirmed, imply that it too is in an orbit that is close to edge-on. Between them, no measurement of c's nor f's inclination has been made. It had been thought that with five planets, the system cannot deviate far from coplanar {{in order to maintain}} stability. An attempt to measure the spin-orbit misalignment of the innermost planet reported that it was in a nearly polar orbit, but this interpretation of the data has since been challenged by a subsequent study, with noted inconsistencies between the implied and measured stellar rotation.|$|E
5|$|In nearby objects (within our Milky Way galaxy) {{observed}} redshifts {{are almost}} always related to the line-of-sight velocities associated with the objects being observed. Observations of such redshifts and blueshifts have enabled astronomers to measure velocities and parametrize the masses of the orbiting stars in spectroscopic binaries, a method first employed in 1868 by British astronomer William Huggins. Similarly, small redshifts and blueshifts detected in the spectroscopic measurements of individual stars are one way astronomers {{have been able to}} diagnose and measure the presence and characteristics of planetary systems around other stars and have even made very detailed differential measurements of redshifts during planetary transits to determine precise <b>orbital</b> <b>parameters.</b> Finely detailed measurements of redshifts are used in helioseismology to determine the precise movements of the photosphere of the Sun. Redshifts have also been used to make the first measurements of the rotation rates of planets, velocities of interstellar clouds, the rotation of galaxies, and the dynamics of accretion onto neutron stars and black holes which exhibit both Doppler and gravitational redshifts. Additionally, the temperatures of various emitting and absorbing objects can be obtained by measuring Doppler broadening – effectively redshifts and blueshifts over a single emission or absorption line. By measuring the broadening and shifts of the 21-centimeter hydrogen line in different directions, astronomers have been able to measure the recessional velocities of interstellar gas, which in turn reveals the rotation curve of our Milky Way. Similar measurements have been performed on other galaxies, such as Andromeda. As a diagnostic tool, redshift measurements {{are one of the most}} important spectroscopic measurements made in astronomy.|$|E
25|$|Simple {{collision}} {{models can}} be used to estimate the possible dispersion of the <b>orbital</b> <b>parameters</b> given a velocity impulse Δv. Applying these models to the known <b>orbital</b> <b>parameters</b> makes it possible to estimate the Δv necessary to create the observed dispersion. A Δv of tens of meters per seconds (5–50m/s) could result from a break-up. Dynamical groupings of irregular satellites can be identified using these criteria and the likelihood of the common origin from a break-up evaluated.|$|E

30|$|Based on {{energetic}} parameter calculations, BCPTI {{has a lower}} {{value of}} electrophilicity in gas phase and therefore this molecule is a stronger nucleophile than BTPTT but based on <b>orbital</b> <b>parameter</b> calculations, the BCPTI is a weaker nucleophile than BTPTT in liquid phase. A larger electroaccepting value corresponds to a better capability of accepting charge, whereas a smaller value of electrodonating value of a system makes it a better electron donor [47].|$|R

Calculation of <b>orbital</b> <b>parameters</b> led to tentative identification as being the Apollo 12 S-IVB stage. Mission controllers had planned to send Apollo 12's S-IVB into solar orbit after separating from the Apollo spacecraft, but it is believed the burn lasted too long, and hence did not send it close enough to the Moon, remaining in a barely stable orbit around the Earth and Moon. In 1971, through a series of gravitational perturbations, it is believed to have entered in a solar orbit and then returned into weakly captured Earth orbit 31 years later. It left Earth orbit again in June 2003.|$|E

30|$|The high-latitude {{location}} of the EISCAT_ 3 D radar has pros and cons. The biggest disadvantage is that the radar {{will not be able}} to measure objects with low inclinations, as these will never fly over the radar. However, most of the orbital debris is in high-inclination Sun-synchronous orbits, which means that it will pass over EISCAT_ 3 D. Due to this fact, the density of orbital debris is higher at high latitudes, meaning that EISCAT_ 3 D will be able to observe more debris per unit volume than radars located in more southern locations.
