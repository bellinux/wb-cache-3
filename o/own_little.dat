5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It got me out of my <b>own</b> <b>little</b> world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, the {{outbreak}} of World War II forced the Szigetis to leave Europe for the United States. (Irene remained in Switzerland, having married pianist Nikita Magaloff earlier that year.) They settled in California, where Wanda, always fond of nature, was delighted {{to be able to}} raise her own garden. In a letter to a friend, Szigeti describes their California life: Wanda is happy, doing wonders with her gardening, chicken and rabbit raising, preserve and pâté de foie making. She doesn't budge from our place, doesn't {{want to come back to}} New York even for a visit, which I, for one, can well understand! Two dogs, an aviary full of exotic birds, tomatoes, grapes, strawberries, asparagus, artichokes, lovely flowers (camellias too!), right in our <b>own</b> <b>little</b> world.|$|E
5|$|On July 5, 1861, at {{nineteen}} Myers {{became a}} teller and cashier at the Mohawk Valley Bank. General Francis E. Spinner was the {{treasurer of the}} bank at the time. His first year as a trainee was without pay. Myers then received a salary of $100 per year, being higher than normal since he put in extra attention to his work habits. He opened his <b>own</b> <b>little</b> telegraph office in July 1863 within the counting office of the bank. This was the first telegraph office for the town of Mohawk, New York. He constructed all the necessary telegraph equipment needed and taught himself Morse code. Myers' income from this bank telegraph business was one-half of his total income. He eventually {{had to give up}} being a part-time telegraph operator within the bank, as his bank responsibilities took up most of his time. He turned over the telegraph business to the local post office with Austin Shall as the operator.|$|E

25|$|In {{reaction}} to the desolation of the abandoned burnt-out buildings of the South Bronx, Fekner stenciled Last Hope in large letters above one crumbling structure so that every time you passed it you couldn’t block {{it out of your}} vision. Now you know you can’t change the world, but you can’t sit back and watch it implode either, so you’ll do your part, have your <b>own</b> <b>little</b> victory, and so will the next guy and the next, and maybe things will start to change.|$|E
25|$|The Heroninos Archive is {{the name}} given to a huge {{collection}} of papyrus documents, mostly letters, but also including {{a fair number of}} accounts, which come from Roman Egypt in 3rd century AD. The bulk of the documents relate to the running of a large, private estate is named after Heroninos because he was phrontistes (Koine Greek: manager) of the estate which had a complex and standardised system of accounting which was followed by all its local farm managers. Each administrator on each sub-division of the estate drew up his <b>own</b> <b>little</b> accounts, for the day-to-day running of the estate, payment of the workforce, production of crops, the sale of produce, the use of animals, and general expenditure on the staff. This information was then summarized as pieces of papyrus scroll into one big yearly account for each particular sub-division of the estate. Entries were arranged by sector, with cash expenses and gains extrapolated from all the different sectors. Accounts of this kind gave the owner the opportunity to take better economic decisions because the information was purposefully selected and arranged.|$|E

25|$|The Ainsworth {{family moved}} to Smedly Lane, north of Manchester in Cheetham Hill, during 1811. They kept the old {{residence}} {{in addition to the}} new, but resided in the new home most of the time. The surrounding hilly country was covered in woods, which allowed Ainsworth and his brother to act out various stories. When not playing, Ainsworth was tutored by his uncle, William Harrison. In March 1817, he was enrolled at Manchester Grammar School, which was described in his novel Mervyn Clitheroe. The work emphasised that his classical education was of good quality but was reinforced with strict discipline and corporal punishment. Ainsworth was a strong student and was popular among his fellow students. His school days were mixed; his time within the school and with his family was calm even though there were struggles within the Manchester community, the Peterloo Massacre taking place in 1819. Ainsworth was connected to the event because his uncles joined in protest at the incident, but Ainsworth was able to avoid most of the political after-effects. During the time, he was able to pursue his own literary interests and even created his <b>own</b> <b>little</b> theatre within the family home at King Street. Along with his friends and brother, he created and acted in many plays throughout 1820.|$|E
500|$|At Wood Farm, John became [...] "a {{satellite}} {{with his}} <b>own</b> <b>little</b> household on an outlying farm on the Sandringham estate...

500|$|This episode {{marks the}} first {{on-screen}} appearance of the Daleks as a primary adversary, without their creator Davros, since the 1974 Third Doctor story Death to the Daleks. [...] Since his introduction in 1975's Genesis of the Daleks, Davros had appeared in every subsequent Dalek story in the original series run. [...] He is not named in this episode, but the Doctor describes him as [...] "a genius... {{a man who was}} king of his <b>own</b> <b>little</b> world". Davros would later be re-introduced in the 2008 two-part story The Stolen Earth/Journey's End.|$|E
500|$|It was {{recorded}} at Sear Sound in New York using two vintage Telefunken ELA M 251 E mics into a Forsell Technologies FetCode preamp. Most of it {{was recorded}} onto the same Studer 1" [...] two-track {{that was used to}} mix Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band! Everything was tracked live, and I’ve decided never to record wearing headphones again unless I absolutely have to. Wearing headphones is bullshit, because you’re in your <b>own</b> <b>little</b> world playing to a mix that no one will ever hear but you. What’s the point? ...|$|E
500|$|On 2 July 2014, it was {{announced}} {{there would be a}} special episode broadcast between the third and fourth series. Filming began on 5 January 2015 and wrapped on 10 February 2015. Moffat confirmed the episode is set in Victorian London, saying, [...] "The special is its own thing. We wouldn't have done the story we're doing, and the way we're doing it, if we didn't have this special. It's not part of the run of three episodes. So we had this to do it … It's kind of in its <b>own</b> <b>little</b> bubble." ...|$|E

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, as Kligman and Verdery explain, [...] "Collectivization brought undeniable {{benefits}} to some rural inhabitants, {{especially those who}} had <b>owned</b> <b>little</b> or no land. It freed them from laboring on the fields of others, and it increased their control over wages, lending to their daily existence a stability previously unknown to them." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Young, {{the music}} on Fascination was a {{progression}} for the band, and a challenge for them. Comparing their prior work to the new album, she said, [...] "They're probably a bit more bluegrass-influenced than this one here. While {{we still have the}} bluegrass and roots music influences, we really wanted to push ourselves harder on this one, something a bit more challenging to play live." [...] She described their music through their fourth album as having evolved, explaining that it began as traditional roots and bluegrass, but after six years is [...] "our <b>own</b> <b>little</b> sound". The track [...] "The Crystal Merchant" [...] was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance.|$|E
500|$|Many Antemoro work as ombiasy {{and earn}} their {{livelihood}} selling their services as astrologers, sorcerers, or crafters of powerful amulets; {{it is common}} for men to travel for six to ten months out of the year. Coffee production is widespread in the Antemoro homeland and generates income for many families.

The album, The Story of Your Life, was released October 5, 2010, and according to West, {{is a response to}} thousands of life stories his fans shared with him. [...] "The first day, I got 1,000 stories. All of a sudden, I was like, 'holy cow, something special is about to take place'. I rented a cabin in Tennessee, about 25 minutes from my house that felt like it was {{out in the middle of}} nowhere. And I spent two months in that cabin reading 10,000 stories," [...] the singer/songwriter reported in an interview with CBN.com. Matthew is also starring in The Heart of Christmas.|$|E

500|$|McCartney {{primarily}} flatpicks {{while playing}} acoustic guitar, though he also uses elements of fingerpicking. Examples of his acoustic guitar playing on Beatles tracks include [...] "Yesterday", [...] "I'm Looking Through You", [...] "Michelle", [...] "Blackbird", [...] "I Will", [...] "Mother Nature's Son" [...] and [...] "Rocky Raccoon". McCartney singled out [...] "Blackbird" [...] {{as a personal}} favourite and described his technique for the guitar part in the following way: [...] "I got my <b>own</b> <b>little</b> sort of cheating way of ... I'm actually sort of pulling two strings at a time... I was trying to emulate those folk players." [...] He employed a similar technique for [...] "Jenny Wren". He played an Epiphone Texan on many of his acoustic recordings, but also used a Martin D-28.|$|E
500|$|While Confessions {{was still}} in production, Usher promised [...] "real talk" [...] in it.

Dupri {{expected}} people to question some of the personal lyrics they associated in the song.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} written by Glen Morgan and James Wong and {{directed}} by David Nutter. Originally, the season two premiere {{was supposed to be}} written by series creator Chris Carter. In the rough draft of this version, Mulder would have been sent to Moscow. Carter, instead, assigned Morgan and Wong the task of writing the season opener. Before working on The X-Files, Morgan had written a script with the same name about a man who goes to a telescope located in Chile. The script was never made, but Morgan liked various elements of it, so he cannibalized parts for [...] "Little Green Men". In addition, the episode was specifically written for Mulder to question himself and his beliefs. According to the two writers, one of the main themes of the episode is “the idea that we all have to fight our <b>own</b> <b>little</b> green men and carry on.” ...|$|E

50|$|ROCE is used {{to prove}} the value the {{business}} gains from its assets and liabilities.

50|$|Malory died on 14 March 1471 and {{was buried}} in Christ Church Greyfriars, near Newgate Prison.
