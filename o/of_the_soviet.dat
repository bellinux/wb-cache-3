5|$|With Poland being {{a member}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Bloc, the party's pursuits of power and reform were {{permanently}} hindered by the restrictions and limits imposed by the rulers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, by the resentful attitude of Polish society, acutely conscious of its lack of national independence and freedoms, and by {{the understanding of the}} party managers that their positions would terminate once they stop conforming to the requirements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> alliance (because of both the lack of public support and Soviet reaction). Poland's political history was governed by the mutual dependence of the Soviets and the Polish communists.|$|E
