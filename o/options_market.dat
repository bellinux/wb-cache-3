40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to survey a wide range of {{empirical}} papers on <b>option</b> <b>markets</b> to address the extent to which <b>option</b> <b>markets</b> affect price discovery on the spot market. The theoretical prediction that informed traders should sometimes trade in the <b>option</b> <b>market</b> has been examined empirically by several authors. The existing empirical evidence for such a view, however, is mixed. One group of researchers support the hypothesis that information reflects in <b>option</b> <b>market</b> first and find a significant lead for the <b>option</b> <b>market.</b> Another group of researchers support the hypothesis that information reflects in stock markets first and trading activities in <b>option</b> <b>markets</b> are not significant.

40|$|The authors present two {{examples}} {{in which the}} addition of an <b>option</b> <b>market</b> leads to sunspot equilibria {{despite the fact that}} no sunspot equilibria exist without the market. These examples highlight limitations in two prevalent views of <b>option</b> <b>markets.</b> It is often assumed that <b>option</b> <b>markets</b> help complete otherwise incomplete markets.

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the impact of market {{activity}} on the percentage bid-ask spreads of S&P 100 index options using transaction data. We propose a new market microstructure theory called a derivative hedge theory, in which <b>option</b> <b>market</b> percentage spreads will be inversely related to the <b>option</b> <b>market</b> maker's ability to hedge his positions in the underlying market, as measured by the liquidity of this underlying market. In a perfect hedge world, spreads arise from the illiquidity of the underlying market, rather than from inventory risk or informed trading in the <b>option</b> <b>market</b> itself. We estimate three models to investigate various market microstructure theories. In the static model, option spreads are a function of moneyness, time to maturity, option prices, hedge ratios and volatility. The dynamic model includes time between trades or duration and average volume per transaction while the cross-market model adds cross <b>option</b> <b>market</b> activity and spreads in the underlying <b>market.</b> We find <b>option</b> <b>market</b> volume is not a significant determinant of <b>option</b> <b>market</b> spreads, which challenges the validity of volume as a proxy for liquidity and supports my theory. <b>Option</b> <b>market</b> spreads are positively related to spreads in the underlying market, again supporting our theory. However, <b>option</b> <b>market</b> duration does affect <b>option</b> <b>market</b> spreads, with very slow and very fast <b>option</b> <b>markets</b> both leading to bigger spreads. Only the fast market result would be predicted by asymmetric information theory. Inventory models predict big spreads in slow markets. Neither would be observed if the underlying securities market provided a perfect hedge. We interpret these mixed results to mean that the <b>option</b> <b>market</b> maker is able to only imperfectly hedge his positions in the underlying securities market. Our result of insignificant option volume casts doubt on the price discovery argument between stock and <b>option</b> <b>markets</b> (Easley, O'Hara, and Srinivas (1997)). Asymmetric information costs in either market are naturally passed to the other market by market maker's hedging and therefore it is unimportant where the informed traders trade...|$|R

While unidirectional causality from cash market volatility to call <b>option</b> <b>market</b> activity is documented for both the subperiods, bilateral causality between put <b>option</b> <b>market</b> activity and cash market volatility was found for one of the subperiods.

It is found that the expected volatility of the underlying asset increases in the net order flow in the <b>option</b> <b>market.</b> Also, {{the depth of the}} <b>option</b> <b>market</b> is smaller when there is more uncertainty about the variance of the underlying asset, which is conceptually consistent with empirical findings in the equity <b>option</b> <b>market.</b> <b>Options</b> (Finance); Financial <b>markets...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} model in which the {{addition}} of an <b>option</b> <b>market</b> leads to sunspot equilibria in an economy which has no sunspot equilibrium before the market is introduced.
