30|$|To {{this basic}} silica-soda-lime mix {{could be added}} modifying agents that {{produced}} colour, removed colour to form colourless glass, or <b>opacified</b> <b>glass.</b> Comparative analysis and interpretation of compositional glass data is initially based on the essential raw materials, the so-called reduced glass composition that excludes intentionally added modifiers such as colourants and opacifiers, and includes the basic glassmaking oxides and their associated ‘contaminant’ oxides. Besides silica, soda and lime which are the major components, magnesia, potash and phosphorus are typically minor impurities associated with a plant ash soda flux, while iron, titania and alumina may enter the glass as natural sedimentary contamination of the silica sand source [8, 11, 16, 25, 36, 37, 61 : p. 162 T]. Alumina may also be derived from the refractory containers used in glass production [47, 61 : p. 175 T].|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{the study}} is to {{understand}} how antimonate opacifying crystals were obtained throughout history. Two archaeological glass productions opacified with calcium and lead antimonates are studied in this paper, in order to rediscover ancient opaque glass technologies: Roman mosaic tesserae (1 st cent. B. C. - 4 th cent. A. D.) and Nevers lampworking glass (18 th cent. A. D.). The fine examination of crystalline phases and of the vitreous matrix is undertaken using various and complementary techniques. Results are compared with a modern reference production, for which the technological process is well known. We demonstrate that Ca-antimonate opacifiers in Roman mosaic tesserae, as well as in Nevers lampworking glass, were obtained by in situ crystallization. Nevertheless, Roman and Nevers glass would have undergone different firing processes. We propose that the addition of previously synthesized crystals or the use of "anime" could be the process used to obtain Pb-antimonate <b>opacified</b> <b>glass,</b> for both productions studied. We demonstrate that CaO, PbO and Sb 2 O 3 concentrations in the bulk compositions and in the matrices, and their evolution with the crystallinity ratio, offer robust criteria for the distinction of the opacification process used. Also, the different crystalline structures help to provide information on the experimental condition...|$|E
40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} results of archaeometric {{characterisation}} of the opaque tesserae, intentionally coloured with antimony- or phosphorus-based opacifiers, coming {{from one of the}} two only palaeo- Christian glass mosaics known in the Veneto region (Italy), i. e., the mosaic which decorated the votive chapel of St. Prosdocimus in Padova. In particular, 55 tesserae belonging to glass types “White”, “Blue”, “Yellow”, “Green” and “Brown” are examined here. The multi-methodological approach (SEM-EDS, EMPA, XRPD, imaging spectroscopy coupled, in some cases, with XAS) gave valuable insights into the complexities of palaeo-Christian glass mosaic production technologies. Two main groups are identified, one characterised by glassy matrixes and opacifiers (calcium or lead antimonate) typical of the Roman period and comprising all “White”, “Blue”, and “Yellow” tesserae and some “Green” ones, and the other characterised by glassy matrixes and an opacifier (calcium phosphate) typical of the 6 th century AD, composed of “Green” and “Brown” tesserae. This suggests that, during that century there was a gradual change from older to “new” production technologies: although new opacifiers such as calcium phosphate started to be used, the frequent use of antimony-based ones (43 / 55 samples) supports the hypothesis that their systematic use was extended until the 6 th century, although re-using old tesserae cannot be completely excluded. In addition, comparisons with compositional groups already identified in the “gold” tesserae of the same mosaic and tesserae from Ravenna demonstrate that both the same “base compositions” of the glass were used to produce transparent and opaque glass. This evidence, coupled with {{the results of}} the historical-artistic study, suggests technological connections between Padova and Ravenna, the capital of Byzantine mosaics in Italy. Micro-structural observations and chemical analyses of the Paduan antimonybased <b>opacified</b> <b>glass</b> demonstrate that different processes and raw materials were used in their production. Both in situ and ex situ crystallisation can be identified for calcium and lead antimonate in Paduan tesserae, whereas the production of tesserae opacified with calcium phosphate generally appears to be highly standardised. Although the opacifiers used in the Paduan tesserae support technological transitions, the colouring elements identified here, i. e., iron and manganese for white, yellow, brown and some green tesserae, cobalt for blue, and copper for blue and green, suggest continuity, because their use is widely testified in the production of both transparent and opaque glass artefacts dating from the Bronze Age until Medieval times, from whichever archaeological site the samples come. Peculiar relationships among the oxidation states of colouring elements, their contents in the glassy matrix, the types of opacifiers used, and the final colour of tesserae were identified. In addition, the correlations of cobalt and/or copper with other elements, together with identification of relics of colouring and “metallic” droplets, allow us to speculate on possible sources and production technologies. Lastly, identification of newly formed crystalline inclusions in tesserae also yields information on kiln temperatures, which ranged between 900 and 1150 °C, a range easily reached in the furnaces of the 6 th century AD...|$|E

50|$|The Chinese lead-barium glasses {{typically}} present 5 to 15% BaO. The {{source of}} barium {{in the glass}} in not clear; however {{it is possible that}} ancient Chinese glassmakers used witherite (a mineral form of barium carbonate) as an ingredient. The use of a separate ingredient implies that barium had a specific function. This function could have been to flux the glass, by lowering the melting point of the melt; or stabilize the glass, by making it less soluble to water. It could also have been added to <b>opacify</b> the <b>glass.</b> Electron microprobe analysis of glass fragments have shown that the turbidity of certain lead-barium glasses is produced by barium disilicate crystals. This turbidity gives the glasses a jade-like appearance.|$|R
50|$|The {{outer layers}} of a goldstone batch {{tend to have}} duller colors and a lower degree of glittery aventurescence. This {{can be caused by}} poor crystallization, which {{simultaneously}} decreases the size of reflective crystals and <b>opacifies</b> the surrounding <b>glass</b> with non reflective particles. It can also be caused by partial oxidation of the copper, causing it to redissolve and form its usual transparent blue-green glass in ionic solution.|$|R

This object is obviously an imitation of the celadon wares imported into the Near East at this time from China. The fritware method of ceramic production was a recent invention in the Near East in the eleventh century and represented a technique {{very different from that}} used to produce the high temperature, long firing porcelains and stoneware of China. The surface glaze made from lead-based <b>glass</b> <b>opacified</b> with tin shows an early mastery of this glazing technique used in glass making of the period. However, this technique is employed here in a non-conventional manner, compared to the normal Near Eastern glazed fritware production of the period. The fritware compositions of the Andone sample can be compared most closely to those of Qal'at Ja'bar (Syria). Other objects found at the site, as well as documented travels, indicate the Count of Angoulecircme's relationship with the Near East...|$|R
