40|$|Proceedings of the BioCreative V. 5 Challenge Evaluation WorkshopThe BioCreative (Critical Assessment of Information Extraction in Biology) is a community-wide {{effort with}} the aim of {{evaluating}} biomedical text mining and information extraction tools. It is organized in the form of shared tasks or challenges. The evaluation workshop linked to each BioCreative event serves to analyze the results obtained for each track, and to present the used Gold Standard datasets/evaluation settings. For each track, top scoring teams were invited to present a system’s description talk to uncover the used methodology and system’s implementation. Building on the achievements of previous BioCreative evaluations and workshops (BioCreative I, II, II. 5, III, 2012 workshop, IV and V [1 – 5]) we have organized the BioCreative V. 5 challenge evaluation workshop in Barcelona, Spain on April 26 th- 27 th, 2017. To promote synergies, this workshop was co-located with the ELIXIR-EXCELERATE workshop on text mining infrastructure requirements, with a particular emphasis on the role of Text Mining systems for Data Curation and Knowledge Management in the Life Sciences domain. The goal of BioCreative V. 5 was to address some of the major barriers to the adoption and use of text mining tools, related to assessment, accessibility, interoperability, robustness and integration. Two traditional BioCreative tracks focused on monitoring progress on the recognition of relevant bio-entities (chemicals – CEMP track and genes/proteins – GPRO track). A novel track called TIPS (Technical interoperability and performance of annotation servers) focused on the technical aspects of the evaluation of continuous text annotation web services. The topics that were addressed during the workshop included: (1) continuous evaluation/stability of text mining tools, (2) enabling of interoperability of multiple text annotation systems at the technical level (design of compatible annotation schemas), (3) extraction of textual content from heterogeneous document sources, and (4) visualization and comparative assessment of automatic and manual annotations. Through the contribution of invited speakers and panel sessions, we also discussed aspects related to annotation formats, technical integration of text mining components, the experience of text mining techniques for the DARPA Big Mechanism program and the use of text processing web services and workflows. During the collocated workshops, the OpenMinted project and the <b>open</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders</b> were presented. We acknowledge the OpenMinted (654021) and the ELIXIR-EXCELERATE (676559) H 2020 projects, and the Encomienda MINETAD-CNIO as part of the Plan for the Advancement of Lan-guage Technology for funding.

As planned, KommAustria completed a <b>call</b> <b>for</b> interest regarding DAB+ in August 2012. KommAustria intended to launch DAB+ by an <b>open</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>tender</b> regarding the DAB+ network if enough parties showed believable and sustainable interest. A minimum limit of 12 possible programs (to fill one MUX coverage) was set. Unfortunately this limit was not reached as too few parties showed interest or failed to meet the criteria of the <b>call</b> <b>for</b> interest. Most remarkably, the public broadcaster ORF and the bigger players in the Austrian market did not show interest but strongly voiced their opposition against the launch of DAB+ in Austria. However, there is a group of broadcasters who are very outspoken in favour of DAB+, but the majority of radio stations remain unsure. The public broadcaster ORF has renewed its objection to any DAB+ plans. In the upcoming [...] "Digitalisation Concept" [...] which marks the authority’s official strategy and schedule for the digitalisation of broadcasting, KommAustria plans to elaborate on the technical details of a possible DAB+ network. There will be no further <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> interest but the possibility <b>for</b> a <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>tender</b> upon request. Nevertheless, a working group that was created in 2009 to consider the countries digital future is still at work. Its members are stakeholders from the Austrian radio market who represent opponents and proponents of digital radio. It consists of the regulatory authority, the public broadcaster ORF, the commercial and non-commercial broadcasters associations, the electronic industry and consumer associations. The group is constantly watching and evaluating the progress of digital radio in other European countries. The success of digital radio in Germany will affect whether Austria decides to implement DAB+.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of a {{graduation}} project, conducted at the financial consultancy firm Maritime Transport and Business Solutions, to fulfill the Master of Science program Management of Technology at the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management at Delft University of Technology. This thesis comes forth out the increasing awareness of the port industry on sustainability and the continuous growth of container transport. Dutch ports are more and more constrained by their physical and environmental boundaries. To reduce the environmental and physical constraints of ports, this research aims to examine whether it is possible to stimulate container terminal operators to enhance their environmental performance. Environment is one of the three elements to enhance sustainability. In order to enhance sustainability it is important to increase the environmental performance without compromising the economic and social factors. A port authority has two revenue streams which both can be used to pressure concessionaires and visiting modalities. This thesis focuses on the incorporation of environmental criteria in the concession agreement and thereby the feasibility to exert pressure on the private sector to increase sustainability. This is combined in the following research question, “How can environmental criteria be incorporated in the awarding procedure for port concessions in order to enhance sustainability of container terminal operations?" In order to do so three building blocks are determined that will provide the information. These three building blocks are, - Concession awarding process, - Evaluation methods for port concessions, - Environmental themes. Container terminal concessions are increasingly awarded via a competitive process. This competitive process can consist of private bilateral negotiation or container terminal concessions can be awarded through an <b>open</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>tender.</b> In the awarding process environmental criteria are underexposed but already present in the form of existing legislation and permits. The use of environmental awarding criteria is virtually absent in ports with the exception of Maasvlakte 2. For Maasvlakte 2 concessions an environmental management system and modal split criteria have been used as environmental awarding criteria. The developed evaluation method <b>for</b> port <b>tenders</b> does not differ from other investment projects. The Net Present Value technique is used to determine the added value of the container terminal investment for the port authority. The net present value technique is incorporated in the business case which is an analysis of to determine whether an investment for the port authority is worthwhile. The weighed sum is an evaluation model is the most widely applied evaluation model <b>for</b> <b>tenders.</b> The European Commission implicitly refers to use the weighted sum as evaluation model to evaluate the outcome of a tender process. The establishment of weighting is ultimately determined by political decisions. The net present value technique provides insight on the costs or benefits on the incorporation of environmental criteria and is used as input to apply the weighted sum technique. The combination to determine the value of a project with the net present value technique and further develop an evaluation method with the method of the weighted sum provides an evaluation method to combine the best of both worlds. Environmental themes that are important for consideration in the awarding process of container terminals are: - Air quality, - Energy consumption, - Intensification in use of space, - Water quality management, - Noise, - Light - Preservation and development of nature. These themes have come forth out of desk research and the conducted expert interviews. The themes are reviewed by experts in interviews to judge the feasibility of the themes for the construction of awarding criteria. For the port authorities, an expert from the Port of Rotterdam, two experts from the Port of Amsterdam and one expert of Zeeland Seaports are interviewed. To represent the terminal operators one expert of APM Terminals and one expert of Europe Container Terminals (United States Environmental Protection Agency) have been interviewed. Representing the government, three experts of the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management were interviewed. In order maintain coherence with economic and social parts of sustainability for both these aspects of sustainability an indicator is introduced. For the economic part this indicator is profitability and for social part this indicator is employment. The combination of environmental, social and economical themes represents the sustainability framework. The interviewed experts have acknowledged that incorporation of environmental awarding criteria will stimulate environmental innovation and considering the environment is an increasing dominant factor to maintain their license-to-operate. This license-to-operate is under continuous pressure due to the general trend in society to enhance sustainability. In order to cope with the general trend in society the experts have indicated that intensification in use of space is the most important theme to enhance sustainability. Dutch ports and society are constraint by the physical constraints of the country. To be able to expand the ports’ transshipment without physical expansion benefits the port authorities and society in general. Society in general benefits due to the reason that space can therefore be utilized for other purposes, as housing or recreation for instance. Therefore an indicator for this theme is developed which is based on terminal efficiency and is calculated by the annual throughput per square meter. The second stage of this research has reviewed the feasibility to incorporate intensification of space in the awarding process. To be able to provide sensible comment on this topic, two cases were abstracted from real terminals. The straddle carrier terminal and the change needed in a rail mounted gantry crane terminal. On basis of their differences the needed change to increase sustainability in port operation is mapped. The analysis of the reference terminals was divided in a financial review, an environmental analysis and the application of the evaluation methodology. The reference terminals have revealed that in Hong Kong intensification of space is possible on basis of current practices. The reference cases served as input for the financial review. A business case served as financial review. The business case has revealed that intensification of space is financially feasible. The financial analysis has indicated the trade-off between the economic indicator, profitability and the environmental indicator, space. Based on this business case the performance measures and scoring functions for the weighted sum are constructed. Both reference container terminals are subjected to an environmental analysis based on the sustainable framework of environmental, social and economical themes. This analysis has indicated that the rail mounted gantry crane terminal will have similar of better environmental and social performance than the straddle carrier option. However, due to the higher investments needed to realize the rail mounted gantry crane terminal the profitability of this terminal is lower. To assess whether incorporation in use of space will actually enhance the sustainable performance of container terminals an expert meeting has been held. The port experts of MTBS have revealed that the total sustainability can be determined when all of the above mentioned themes are quantified. Therefore, at this stadium no conclusion can be provided whether the sustainability of container terminals is enhanced with the incorporation of space. However the The general conclusion of this research is that it is possible to enhance the environmental performance of the port by integrating environmental criteria the concession agreement. Based on reference cases the financial, technical and environmental feasibility of the environmental criteria can be determined. The input following from the business case can be used as input for the evaluation model. The application of the weighted sum technique will determine the performance measures and scoring functions of the environmental criterion. When incorporating environmental criteria in the awarding procedure it is important to consider that the environmental criteria are measureable and are attributable to the party responsible. The incorporation of environmental criteria will lead to additional costs without generating additional revenues for port authority and terminal operator. However, from the expert interviews follows that incorporation of environmental criteria is necessary to respond to the general trend in society where environment is becoming an increasingly important topic to maintain their license-to-operate. This implies that environmental criteria have great potential to be incorporated in the near future.

40|$|Green Public Procurement (GPP) {{has been}} {{considered}} as an important policy instrument {{in the context of}} sustainable consumption and production. The state and progress of GPP has earlier been measured by questionnaires and interviews, both methods being based on the assessment by the purchaser, and questionnaires having low response rates. Recently, a new method was developed, analyzing the existence of environmental criteria in the <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders.</b> However, the studies have dealt neither with the progress in GPP, nor the statistical evidence of differences between countries. Our aim was to analyze more thoroughly whether the differences in the proportions of 'green' <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders</b> between the three Nordic countries, Denmark, Finland and Sweden, in 2003 and 2005 were real, and whether there had occurred any progress between the years concerned. The paper also presents the 'GPP-record' method, which enables more valid measurement of the environmental soundness of public purchasing. The statistical analyses were done using logit models with country, year and product group as the explanatory factors. It proved to be relevant {{to take into account the}} variation that occurred from the random existence of product groups in the samples of <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tender.</b> There were less environmental criteria in the <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> <b>tenders</b> in Finland than in Denmark and Sweden in 2003, but in 2005 no significant difference between Finland and Denmark was observed.
