An extensive search of the professional literature between 1963 and June 2001 yielded a total of 21 group design in-tervention studies that met the criteria for inclusion in the synthesis. Using <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> (i. e., semantic organizers, framed outlines, cognitive maps with and without a mnemonic) was associated with improved reading comprehension overall for students with LD. Com-pared to standardized reading measures, researcher-developed comprehension measures were associated with higher effect sizes. Initial gains demonstrated when using <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> were not revealed during later comprehension tasks or on new comprehension tasks. <b>Graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> are visual andspatial displays designed to fa-cilitate the teaching and learn-ing of textual material through the “use of lines, arrows, and a spatial arrange-ment that describe text content, struc-ture, and key conceptual relationships” (Darch & Eaves, 1986, p. 310). <b>Graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> include semantic maps, se-mantic feature analysis, cognitive maps, story maps, framed outlines, and Venn diagrams.

40|$|This {{experiment}} investigated {{whether a}} set of <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> presented as adjuncts to text {{would be more effective}} than an equivalent set of outlines or no adjunct displays in helping students learn various types of information. College students read a 6500 word text on abnormal behavior either with or without {{a set of}} adjunct displays, and then were tested either immediately or two days later. Tests included both objective and essay items. Objective items measured knowledge of concept facts that either appeared (represented) or did not appear (nonrepresented) in the adjunct displays, knowledge of the hierarchical structure of concepts, and the ability to transfer knowledge of concepts by identifying novel examples. Essay items measured knowledge of between-concept comparisons and whether written expression of those comparisons involved the use of contrasting premises (comparing concepts along characteristics). Results revealed the following significant findings: (1) the <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> group outperformed the text-only group on the comparisons measure, and (2) the <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> group outperformed the outline group on the contrasting premises measure. Responses to a questionnaire also indicated that students rated <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> as easier to understand than outlines. These findings suggest that <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers,</b> and not outlines, should be used when learning comparisons among concepts and organized writing is desired. <b>Graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> appear to have an advantage over linear displays, such as outlines and text, in making relationships among concepts more explicit, through visual argument (Waller, 1981).

One-hundred-sixty-one students were recruited for participation in the study from a two-year community college and a four-year public university in the southeast United States. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> treatment groups: static, sortable, and shuffle-sortable. Response accuracy and response latency measurements for three types of mental tasks (factual, comparative, and inferential) were compared across the three treatment groups. A multivariate analysis of variance showed no significant difference between the three <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> types for response accuracy. A within-groups analysis of variance showed no significant differences in response accuracy between mental tasks within the static or sortable treatment groups. However, analysis of variance indicated that accuracy for inferential judgments was lower than that for factual judgments in the shuffle-sortable group. With respect to response latency, a multivariate analysis of variance revealed no significant difference between the three treatment groups. A within-groups analysis of variance showed significant differences in response latency between factual and inferential judgment-making for both the sortable and shuffle-sortable treatments. The sortable treatment had the most pronounced differences in latency between mental tasks, whereas no significant differences in response latency were observed within the static treatment. Participants in the two dynamic treatments reported much higher percentages of affirmative responses to the question, “Did you think your <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> was an effective instructional tool?” with 82. 7 % and 81. 5 % responding “yes” for the Sortable and Shuffle-sort groups, respectively, and only 60. 0 % responding “yes” for the Static group. The <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> in the study are known as adjunct displays and therefore each was associated with an accompanying text passage. Participants had the capability of viewing the accompanying text passage at will within the constraints of a five-minute <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> study period. Analysis of variance revealed that participants in the shuffle-sortable group spent significantly less time viewing the text passage than participants in the static group, possibly because the overhead associated with the shuffle-sortable <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer’s</b> user interface controls consumed time or mental resources that would have otherwise been used to view the text.

The scored {{obtained}} from the students at SMPN 18 Banda Aceh showed that the students had problems in writing skill, because, according to observation in preliminary research, the teacher did not use any media in teaching writing. The objective {{of this study was}} to find out the impact of implementing <b>Graphic</b> <b>Organizer</b> strategy in improving students' writing skill. The writer gave 3 meeting of treatments by using <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> instruction. Thus, this research was included as an experimental study with one "group pre-test post-test design. The sample of this research was chosen. by using random sampling technique consisting 23 second grade students of SMPN 18 Banda Aceh. The writer followed the procedures of quantitative research in which the data was gathered using written test before and after the treatments were given. Then, the collected data were analyzed statistically with the t-test formula. Finally, after analyzing the data collected, it was found that there was an improvement on the students' writing ability after the treatments. The result showed that hypothesis (Ha) was accepted since the score of t-test (1. 7) was higher than the t-table (0. 4599). In conclusion, <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> as a tool in the prewriting stage can be applied as a solution to students' writing problems. With the positive findings of this study, it might be a good reference for teachers to start implementing <b>graphic</b> <b>organizer</b> in the writing class. i...|$|R

Includes bibliographical {{references}} leaves 86 - 91. This {{study investigated}} the effectiveness of discourse structure-based <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> on intermediate level EFL students‟ reading comprehension of selected texts. The {{purpose of the study}} was to determine whether students who used discourse structure-based <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> as a post-reading activity would perform better on post-test summaries compared to those who were involved in a discussion as a post-reading activity. This study also explored the attitudes of students towards the use of discourse structure-based <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> in reading instruction. Two intact intermediate-level EFL classes at Uludağ University School of Foreign Languages participated in the study. The data were collected through the administration of four post-test summaries and a questionnaire that was in a Likertscale format. The statistical analysis of the post-test scores revealed that the students who completed discourse structure-based <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> as a post-reading activity performed significantly better in the post-test summaries of the four selected texts than the students who participated in discussion as a post-reading activity. The analysis of the participant students‟ responses to the attitude questionnaire showed that the students had mixed attitudes towards the utilization of discourse structurebased <b>graphic</b> <b>organizers</b> in reading instruction.
