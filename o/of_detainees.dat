Benzodiazepines are sometimes used for criminal purposes; they serve to incapacitate a victim in cases of drug assisted rape or robbery.|$|E

The blocking was criticized by Human Rights Watch. In November 2011, after the Libyan Civil War, YouTube was once again allowed in Libya.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{there was}} no system in place to allow prisoners to send letters; {{censorship}} arrangements were made through the Dominion Police in Ottawa, and the American Consul was designated a representative for prisoner welfare. As the war progressed, groups <b>of</b> <b>detainees</b> were transferred to and from other prisons according to their behaviour or level of risk {{and the number of}} inmates per institution. After the 1917 Halifax Explosion, prisoners were transferred to the 800-man Amherst Internment Camp at Amherst, Nova Scotia. One of the prisoners transferred may have been Leon Trotsky, although this is disputed.|$|E
5|$|On October 17, 2006, Bush {{signed into}} law the Military Commissions Act of 2006, a law enacted {{in the wake of}} the Supreme Court's {{decision}} in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, , which allows the U.S. government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial. The law also denies them access to habeas corpus and bars the torture <b>of</b> <b>detainees,</b> but allows the president to determine what constitutes torture.|$|E

5|$|The first {{allegations}} of detainee abuse came in early February 2007, when University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran produced documents {{he had received}} through an access-to-information request showing that three prisoners {{in the custody of}} Canadian military police were brought in by their Afghan interrogator for treatment of similar injuries to the head and upper body, all on the same day. Attaran argued this could be evidence of torture {{on the part of the}} interrogator and should be investigated. Attaran has maintained these allegations, stating in 2010 that the documents show torture <b>of</b> <b>detainees</b> was an actual tactic used to obtain information during interrogation.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{arrival at}} the facility, some of the prisoners were {{selected}} for beatings or execution. Survivors reported {{that some of the}} detainees were escorted to the brickyard, from which shots could be heard, and those detainees were not seen again. One surviving prisoner later reported that he witnessed the killing of one prisoner in the camp itself, when Serbian paramilitaries slit the victim's throat in front <b>of</b> <b>detainees.</b> Other prisoners were beaten during interrogations, were shot and wounded, or were otherwise abused. On 19 November, gradual transfer of the detainees to Sremska Mitrovica prison in Serbia started. These transfers caused a clash between Vujić and the Croatian Serb TO, as the latter wanted to keep the detainees under their control.|$|E
5|$|On 18 December 2005, then-Chief of Defence Staff Rick Hillier {{signed an}} {{agreement}} between Canada's Department of National Defence and the Government of Afghanistan. The agreement did not include any explicit right of access by Canada to Afghan detainees. Members of the opposition requested then-Minister of National Defence Gordon O'Connor to renegotiate the prisoner transfer agreement. This request was dismissed, with O'Connor saying the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent fulfilled the duty of ensuring fair treatment <b>of</b> <b>detainees</b> and Canada could be notified and take action in any cases of abuse. However, the Red Cross stated that their mandate was being misunderstood, {{and it was the}} responsibility of Canada. It maintained that it had no role in monitoring the Canada-Afghanistan detainee-transfer agreement, and that following long-established operating procedure, the Red Cross would not reveal to any foreign government any abuses it might find in Afghan prisons. While maintaining that detainee monitoring was the Red Cross' duty until March 2007, O'Connor apologized to the House of Commons for previously misleading them on the issue. In turn, a new agreement was reached in April 2007 that allowed Canadian officials to have access to Kandahar jails.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} 1941 and the {{beginning}} of 1942, approximately 7,000 Jewish women, children and old men were brought to the camp, along with a further 500 Jewish men and 292 Romani women and children. Most of these people were from the outlying Serbian towns, primarily Niš, Smederevo and Šabac. Women and children were placed in makeshift barracks that were barely heated, and whose windows were shattered due to German bombing raids carried out during the invasion of Yugoslavia. Originally constructed as fair pavilions, the largest of these barracks held up to 5,000 prisoners. Inmates suffered during numerous influenza epidemics, slept on wet straw or bare floorboards, and were provided with inadequate amounts of food. Starvation was widespread, and Jewish inmates appealed unsuccessfully to Serbian authorities for more food to be provided to the camp. Consequently, a high number <b>of</b> <b>detainees,</b> especially children, died in late 1941 and early 1942, with many inmates freezing to death in one of the coldest winters on record. The Romani inmates were kept in far more miserable conditions than their Jewish counterparts. They also slept on straw in an unheated hall, but were kept separate from non-Romani prisoners. The majority of Romani inmates were released after six weeks of detention. Most Jewish inmates remained detained, with the exception of ten Jewish women who were married to Christian men.|$|E
