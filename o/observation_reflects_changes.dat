40|$|We have {{performed}} multiangle static and dynamic light scattering studies of lysozyme solutions at pH= 4. 7. The Rayleigh ratio R(sub g) and the collective diffusion coefficient D(sub c) were determined as function of both protein concentration c(sub p) and salt concentration c(sub s) with two different salts. At low salt concentrations, the scattering ratio K(sub c) (sub p) /R(sub theta) and diffusivity increased with protein concentration above the values for a monomeric, ideal solution. With increasing salt concentration this trend was eventually reversed. The hydrodynamic interactions of lysozyme in solution, {{extracted from the}} combination of static and dynamic scattering data, decreased significantly with increasing salt concentration. These <b>observations</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>changes</b> in protein interactions, in response to increased salt screening, from net repulsion to net attraction. Both salts had the same qualitative effect, but the quantitative behavior did not scale with the ionic strength of the solution. This indicates the presence of salt specific effects. At low protein concentrations, the slopes of K(sub c) (sub p) /R(sub theta) and D(sub c) vs c(sub p) were obtained. The dependence of the slopes on ionic strength was modeled using a DLVO potential for colloidal interactions of two spheres, with the net protein charge Z(sub e) and Hamaker constant A(sub H) as fitting parameters. The model reproduces the observed variations with ionic strength quite well. Independent fits to the static and dynamic data, however, led to different values of the fitting parameters. These and other shortcomings suggest that colloidal interaction models alone are insufficient to explain protein interactions in solutions...|$|R

40|$|Visual {{perception}} of our environment essentially {{depends on the}} correct assembly of seven principal cell types into the functional architecture of the neuroretina. During retinogenesis these cell types derive from a common population of multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) residing in the inner layer of the optic cup. In contrast to other well studied regions of the developing CNS, retinal cell diversification is apparently not achieved by spatial prepatterning into distinct progenitor domains, but rather by the sequential production of cell types in a defined histogenetic order.

40|$|International audiencePitch is {{the perceptual}} {{dimension}} along which musical notes are ordered from low to high. It {{is often described}} as the perceptual correlate of the periodicity of the sound's waveform. Previous reports have shown that pitch can depend slightly on sound level. We wanted to verify that these <b>observations</b> <b>reflect</b> genuine <b>changes</b> in perceived pitch, and were not due to procedural factors or confusion between dimensions of pitch and level. We first conducted a systematic pitch matching task and confirmed that the pitch of low frequency pure tones, but not complex tones, decreases by an amount equivalent to a change in frequency of more than half a semitone when level increases. We then showed that the structure of pitch shifts is anti-symmetric and transitive, as expected for changes in pitch. We also observed shifts in the same direction (although smaller) in an interval matching task. Finally, we observed that musicians are more precise in pitch matching tasks than non-musicians but show the same average shifts with level. These combined experiments confirm that the pitch of low frequency pure tones depends weakly but systematically on level. These observations pose a challenge to current theories of pitch...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} of sodium bis(2 -ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) reverse micelles and water-in-oil microemulsions in isooctane and cyclohexane {{has been investigated}} using vibrational spectroscopy. The formation of reverse micelles resulted {{in an increase in}} the interaction between the Na+ counterion and the -SO 3 group, compared with the solid state. Hydration of reverse micelles in cyclohexane to form water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsions led to a shift in the wavenumber of the symmetric sulfonate stretching mode from 1064 to 1050 cm- 1 in the Raman spectrum and from 1051 to 1045 cm- 1 in the infrared spectrum. The difference between the wavenumber of the band maxima in the infrared and Raman spectra, which decreased from 13 to 5 cm- 1 after hydration, is attributed to correlation coupling. The splitting of the antisymmetric sulfonate stretching mode in the infrared spectrum, which produces two strong bands at ca. 1212 and 1248 cm- 1 in the reverse micelles, is also reduced upon hydration. These results are interpreted in terms of the increase in the separation between the Na+ counterion and the -SO 3 - group and an associated increase in the separation between the -SO 3 - groups of adjacent surfactant molecules at the micellar interface. The greatest changes in the interaction between the sulfonate moiety and the sodium counterion occurred below w 0 = [H 2 O]/[AOT] = 3, with only small band shifts in the spectra observed beyond w 0 = 6. No shifts were evident beyond ca. w 0 = 15. These results are consistent with a strong hydrogen-bonding interaction involving three H 2 O molecules located between the oxygen atoms of the -SO 3 - group and a Na+ cation, and the requirement of at least six H 2 O molecules per AOT molecule to completely solvate the head-group. In contrast, hydration produced only minor changes in the relative infrared intensities of carbonyl stretching modes at ca. 1735 and 1723 cm- 1. These <b>observations</b> <b>reflect</b> <b>changes</b> in the relative populations of different conformations about the acyl C-C bond and an increase in the degree of rotation, which accompanies the increase in the average area occupied by the head-group upon hydration...|$|R

Furthermore, the rhythm in CO 2 fixation (per cell) found in nondividing cultures maintained in LD: 12, 12 persisted in LD: 1 / 3, 1 / 3 for weeks with a free running, circadian period of approximately 30 hours. An endogenous, circadian rhythm in cellular chlorophyll was found to exist, independently of cell division, under both light regimens and in each individual experiment; this <b>observation</b> could <b>reflect</b> <b>changes</b> in the functional role of the pigment.

A recently discovered mechanism has linked the enhanced conversion of kynurenine to kynurenic acid (KYNA) to an increased resilience toward stress-induced depression in mice. The {{aim of this study}} was to translate these findings to humans. Materials and methods: Kynurenine and KYNA levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography in plasma samples from 117 patients affected by mild-to-moderate depression before and within a week after a 12 -week training period at three different intensities. The patients were part of the Regassa study. Results: No differences in plasma levels of kynurenine and KYNA or in their ratio could be detected between before and after training. No effect of the intensity group could be observed. No correlation with the improvement in cardiovascular fitness (Åstrand score) or the improvement in mood (Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score) could be observed. Limitations: As the Regassa study is based on an intention-to-treat protocol, the exact time and the exact intensity of the physical exercise are not known. Analyses of pulse data as well as personal interviews, however, were used to control the exercise protocols. Furthermore, the <b>observations</b> <b>reflect</b> chronic <b>changes.</b> Conclusion: Physical exercise positively affects mood and cardiovascular fitness, but does not lead to long-lasting changes in plasma levels of kynurenine and KYNA in patients affected by mild-to-moderate depression...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHost-guest {{interactions}} in poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) hydrogels with pyrocatechol were investigated by 1 H single-pulse, {{as well as}} one- and two-dimensional combined rotation and multiple-pulse spectroscopy (CRAMPS) 1 H solid state NMR techniques. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), swelling measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were used as supplementary methods. The results are compared with the phenol-PNIPA system to explore possible similarities or differences in {{the effects of the}} two phenolic guest molecules on the temperature-induced volume phase transition of the hydrogel. Both small molecules shift the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of the hydrogel, but with phenol the transition is broader. This <b>observation</b> may <b>reflect</b> <b>changes</b> in the 1 H signal from residual water trapped in cavities in the hydrogel above the LCST. Although in the pyrocatechol-containing hydrogel only two signals are observed, the phenol-containing hydrogel displays numerous signals. In the case of phenol, the formation of water cavities is a more complex process, although reaching the equilibrium state requires a very long time (about 40 days). The CRAMPS protocol increases the resolution and makes it possible to perform two-dimensional correlation 1 H- 1 H experiments. The rate matrix calculation yields a host-guest distance that is 0. 3 Ǻ shorter for pyrocatechol than for phenol. Independent calculations by DFT indicate that the host-guest distance is 0. 2 Ǻ shorter for pyrocatechol. The satisfactory agreement between the results from different methods demonstrates that the power of this NMR method extends not only to crystalline, but also to macroscopically amorphous systems possessing only local order...|$|R

Swift J 1910. 2 – 0546 is a candidate black hole low-mass X-ray binary that was discovered in 2012 when it entered an accretion outburst. To investigate the binary configuration and the accretion morphology, we monitored the evolution of the outburst for ≃ 3 months at X-ray, UV, optical (B,V,R,I), and near-infrared (J,H,K) wavelengths using Swift and SMARTS. The source evolved from a hard to a soft X-ray spectral state with a relatively cold accretion disk that peaked at ≃ 0. 5 keV. A Chandra/HETG spectrum obtained during this soft state did not reveal signatures of an ionized disk wind. Both the low disk temperature and the absence of a detectable wind could indicate that the system is viewed at relatively low inclination. The multi-wavelength light curves revealed two notable features that appear to be related to X-ray state changes. First, a prominent flux decrease was observed in all wavebands ≃ 1 – 2 weeks before the source entered the soft state. This dip occurred in (0. 6 – 10 keV) X-rays ≃ 6 days later than at longer wavelengths, which could possibly reflect the viscous timescale of the disk. Second, about two weeks after the source transitioned back into the hard state, the UV emission significantly increased while the X-rays steadily decayed.

40|$|Adsorption of poloxamine 908, a tetrafunctional {{polyethylene}} oxide (PEO) -polypropylene oxide ethylenediamine block copolymer, {{onto the surface}} of monodispersed polystyrene nanoparticles (232 ± 0. 33 nm) follows a bimodal pattern. Initially, the isotherm follows a Langmuir profile with a plateau observable over a very narrow equilibrium poloxamine concentration (0. 0018 - 0. 0031 mM). The isotherm then begins to rise again, reaching a final plateau at equilibrium poloxamine concentrations above 0. 0089 mM. Similarly, the profile of the adsorbed layer thickness of poloxamine on the surface of nanoparticles is bimodal. The first plateau corresponds to a thickness of 4. 6 ± 0. 07 nm, which occurs over the same range of poloxamine concentrations as in the initial plateau of the adsorption isotherm. The second plateau corresponds to a thickness of 9. 53 ± 0. 32 nm, observable at a minimum poloxamine concentration of 0. 0067 mM. By using a calculated radius of gyration of a PEO chain in poloxamine as 3. 1 nm, these <b>observations</b> <b>reflect</b> dynamic <b>changes</b> in the arrangement of surface projected PEO chains; a mushroom-like conformation at the first plateau region of the adsorption isotherm, followed by a transition into a brush-like conformation. These conformational <b>changes</b> are also <b>reflected</b> in rheological studies; the apparent viscosity of nanoparticles in which the PEO chains are in mushroom conformation is considerably higher than particles displaying the brush conformation. Further, atomic force microscopy studies (height profile and phase lag measurements) corroborated that the proposed poloxamine concentration dependent transition of surface associated PEO chains from mushroom to brush appearance is conserved when nanoparticles are dried under ambient conditions. Finally, we compared the influence of the surface PEO characteristics on complement consumption in human serum. Our results show complement-activating nature of all poloxamine-coated nanoparticles. However, complement consumption is reduced substantially with particles bearing a minimum of 11448 poloxamine molecules on their surface, thus demonstrating the importance of PEO surface density as well as brush conformation in suppressing complement consumption. This relationship between surface characteristics of poloxamine nanoparticles and their in vivo performance is discussed. ...|$|R

University of Pittsburgh, 2014 The {{current study}} {{examined}} changes in teacher behavior during the transformation to a 1 : 1 technology initiative on a secondary campus in the Mid-Atlantic region. This study assessed {{the frequency of}} instructional and non-instructional technology use over time.

The current study considered: 1) sex, 2) building level, 3) years of service, 4) participation in a previous technology initiative, 5) academic department, and 6) education level. A review of the literature suggested that several barriers to implementation of successful 1 : 1 technology initiatives exist (Lewis, 2003; Pelgrum 2001; BECTA, 2004; Levin & Wadmany, 2008; Pundak & Rozner, 2007).
