5|$|Beginning in 1914, Harlow Shapley began {{a series}} <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> {{globular}} clusters, published in about 40 scientific papers. He examined the RR Lyrae variables in the clusters (which he assumed were Cepheid variables) and used their period–luminosity relationship for distance estimates. Later, {{it was found that}} RR Lyrae variables are fainter than Cepheid variables, which caused Shapley to overestimate the distances of the clusters.|$|E

He drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness. Leonardo also studied and drew the anatomy of many animals, dissecting cows, birds, monkeys, bears, and frogs, and comparing in his drawings their anatomical structure with that of humans. He also made a number <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> horses.|$|E

In the evenings {{they went to}} small tavernas to enjoy the ambiance; {{all of which is}} {{recorded}} in the letters they sent home to Bauer's family. Bauer's sketchbooks are full <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> antique objects and Renaissance art, some of which he used for his illustrations. A portrait of Ghirlandaio by Sandro Botticelli {{is said to be the}} basis for Svanhamnen (The Swan maiden), and Piero della Francesca's work was the inspiration for Den helige Martin (Saint Martin, the Holy). He also became intrigued by frescoes. He was exuberant in the study of art, but he also became homesick for the quiet serenity of the Swedish forest which resulted in some of his best winter pictures with white snow, dark woods and the sky glittering with tiny stars.|$|E

25|$|In mathematics, {{spectral}} {{theory is}} an inclusive term for theories extending the eigenvector and eigenvalue theory {{of a single}} square matrix to a much broader theory {{of the structure of}} operators in a variety of mathematical spaces.

25|$|Until {{the end of}} the Edo period, in 1868, Shinto and Buddhism were intimately {{connected}} in what was called shinbutsu-shūgō (神仏習合), {{to the point that the}} same buildings were often used as both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples, and Shinto gods were interpreted as manifestations of Buddhas. However, the tendency to oppose Buddhism as a foreign import and to uphold Shinto as the native religion can be seen already during the early modern era, partly as a nationalistic reaction In a broad sense, the term shinbutsu bunri indicates the effects of the anti-Buddhist movement that, from the middle of the Edo period onwards, accompanied the spread of Confucianism, the growth <b>of</b> <b>studies</b> <b>of</b> ancient Japanese literature and culture (kokugaku), and the rise of Shinto-based nationalism, All these movements had reasons to oppose Buddhism.|$|E
