Specialists in this field are tasked with linking bullets and cartridges to weapons and weapons to individuals. Obliterated serial numbers can be raised and recorded in an attempt to find the registered owner of the weapon. Examiners can also look for fingerprints on the weapon and cartridges, and then viable prints can be processed through fingerprint databases for a potential match.|$|E

40|$|Background: The number <b>of</b> pathologically <b>examined</b> {{axillary}} nodes {{has been}} associated with breast cancer survival, and examination of >= 10 nodes has been advocated for reliable axillary staging. The considerable variation observed in axillary staging prompted this population-based study, which evaluated the prognostic effect of a variable number <b>of</b> pathologically <b>examined</b> nodes. Methods: In total, 5314 consecutive breast cancer patients who underwent mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery and axillary dissection between 1994 and 1999 were included. The prognostic effect <b>of</b> the <b>examined</b> number <b>of</b> nodes was assessed with crude and relative survival analysis. Results: A median number of 12 (range, 1 - 43) nodes were histologically examined, and 59 % of the patients had no nodal tumor involvement. The number <b>of</b> <b>examined</b> nodes decreased with age (P = 10 examined nodes (P <. 001), whereas the relative survival did not differ. After adjusting for age, tumor size, number of positive nodes, and detection by screening in a multivariate analysis, the number <b>of</b> <b>examined</b> nodes was not associated with relative survival. Conclusions: This study shows that the association between the number <b>of</b> pathologically <b>examined</b> axillary nodes and overall survival in node-negative and node-positive patients results from stage migration. The absence of an association between the number <b>of</b> <b>examined</b> nodes and relative survival further indicates that the association between the number <b>of</b> <b>examined</b> nodes and crude survival is confounded by age...|$|R

5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{longevity}} of frogs and toads in the wild, but some can live for many years. Skeletochronology is a method <b>of</b> <b>examining</b> bones to determine age. Using this method, the ages of mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa) were studied, the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter. The oldest frogs had ten bands, so their age was believed to be 14 years, including the four-year tadpole stage. Captive frogs and toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years, an age achieved by a European common toad (Bufo bufo). The cane toad (Bufo marinus) has been known to survive 24 years in captivity, and the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) 14 years. Frogs from temperate climates hibernate during the winter, and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time, including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica).|$|E
5|$|Science {{fiction and}} fantasy have {{traditionally}} been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions of sexuality and gender. However, speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures. This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means <b>of</b> <b>examining</b> sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as Nicola Griffith that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants, aliens, and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.|$|E

This was part of a wider project to produce a series of maps covering the entirety of the Roman Empire, for which Crawford visited various parts of Europe during the late 1920s and 1930s. Holiday destinations included Germany, Austria, Romania, Corsica, Malta, Algeria, and Tunisia, and in 1936 he purchased a plot of land in Cyprus on which he had a house built. During these vacations, he visited archaeological sites and met with local archaeologists, encouraging them to contribute articles to Antiquity.|$|E
5|$|These {{reforms were}} also {{significant}} {{in that they}} gave to Senate committees the role <b>of</b> <b>examining</b> the budget (what {{is referred to as}} the estimates process or estimates hearings), which had hitherto been confined to the Senate and its committee of the whole. The role of the committees was enhanced by three subsequent developments. First, in 1982 the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was established, which, in examining all bills, played a role that complemented that of the examination of all delegated legislation by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Second, in 1989 the Senate adopted procedures for the systematic referral of bills to committees, increasing the level of legislative scrutiny taking place within parliament. Third, in 1993, the committees adopted a more extensive procedure for consideration of the budget, creating a second opportunity each year for Senators to follow up issues identified during the initial budget estimates hearings. These second hearings are referred to as supplementary budget estimates. Though the committee system was restructured in 1994, 2006 and again in 2009, the range of functions has remained essentially the same.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the prevalence of cra- niomandibular dysfunction (CMD) in the military personel of the Republic of Serbia, as well as the distribution of sings and symptoms of CMD in this population group. Material and methods. The epidemiological investigation included 284 male persons between 18 - 25 years of age. The sample consisted of Military Academy students, and soldiers from different regions of the Republic of Serbia. A questionnaire was designed using Helkimo's clinical dysfunction index and sings and symptoms of CMD were evaluated, namely the anamnestic index (Ai) and the dysfunction index (Di). Results. According to the anamnestic dysfunction index (Ai), 85 % of persons among the examined group presented without any symptoms of CMD (Ai= 0), 14 % had mild symptoms (Ai = 1) and 1 % had severe symptoms of CMD (Ai= 5). Functional analysis of the orofacial system in the <b>examined</b> group (evaluation <b>of</b> dysfunction index - Di) revealed, however, that 70 % of solders had at least one sign of CMD, precisely a dysfunction index Di> 0. The analysis of signs and symptoms of CMD revealed that disturbances in mandibular kinematics were the most prevalent sign of CMD in this population group, which was confirmed in 56 % <b>of</b> <b>examined</b> persons. Disturbed functions of temporomandibular (TM) joints (click, and reciprocal click, deviation and deflection during mandibular opening) were established in 31 % <b>of</b> <b>examined</b> persons, and sensitivity of TM joints and masticatory muscles during palpation in 4 % <b>of</b> <b>examined</b> persons. Pain during mandibular movements was established only in 1 % <b>of</b> <b>examined</b> persons. Conclusion. The results of this investigation point to significant prevalence of Craniomandibular disorders in the examined population group. The incidence of TMJ and masticaory muscle pain in 4 % <b>of</b> <b>examined</b> persons and <b>of</b> pain during mandibular movements only in 1 % <b>of</b> <b>examined</b> persons, points to presence of mild or initial types of CMD in this population group. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{impact of}} the {{reported}} number of lymph nodes at pathologic examination of colon specimens on survival was studied. METHODS: The data of 2, 281 patients with localized colon cancer were retrospectively reviewed. The effect of tumor characteristics and surgical and pathologic factors {{on the number of}} lymph nodes and examined lymph node numbers on nodal status and survival were analyzed. RESULTS: The number <b>of</b> <b>examined</b> nodes increased with T stage, left-sided tumors, and mucinous morphology, but decreased with age. The proportion of node-positive patients increased with a larger number of nodes. A high number <b>of</b> <b>examined</b> nodes and high T stage affected nodal status. The five-year overall survival was 51. 3 percent for node-positive patients vs. 68. 2 percent for node-negative patients. Node-negative patients had a significantly higher five-year crude and relative survival when more lymph nodes were examined. This was not found for the node-positive group and for all patients combined. CONCLUSIONS: T stage, localization, and patient age were predictive for the number <b>of</b> nodes <b>examined.</b> A higher number <b>of</b> <b>examined</b> nodes was associated with an increase in node positivity. The survival benefit can be explained by stage migration. Eventually this may lead to an overall survival benefit, as more patients are classified as node-positive, and therefore will receive adjuvant therapy...|$|R
