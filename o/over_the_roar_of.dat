Then--she thought of nothing but those children. Why did she not take a book and occupy her mind? To which she had her pert, though just answer, about her mind having quite enough to do to keep clothes on the children's backs, and so forth,--let who list imagine the miserable little squabble;--till she says,--"I know what has put you out so to-night; nothing but the news of my sister's coming."

Alvina felt {{he was going to}} be out of breath. But no, rapid and high came the next verse, verse after verse, with the wild scream on the little new pipe in between, <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the bagpipe. And the crumbs of snow were like a speckled veil, faintly drifting the atmosphere and powdering the littered threshold where they stood--a threshold littered with faggots, leaves, straw, fowls and geese and ass droppings, and rag thrown out from the house, and pieces of paper.|$|E

50|$|The rocket festival {{begins the}} next day. While {{some people are}} {{launching}} their rockets, Ahlo {{is still in the}} woods trying to put his together. He grinds the bat droppings into powder, but tests it out on a few mini rockets, to no avail, so Ahlo tries urinating on the bat dropping powder (advised by Purple, who said that can make it work better). In the contest, Toma launches his rocket, named Lucky, but lets go of it too soon and launches it poorly. A champion rocket named The Million is launched afterwards which successfully reaches the clouds. Ahlo brings his rocket in, which he calls The Bat, but the announcer tells him that kids aren't allowed to launch. Ahlo asks Toma to launch it, but Taitko doesn't allow him to, believing that The Bat will blow everyone up because of Ahlo's bad luck. Nobody else volunteers to do so and Ahlo then runs off. Toma decides to launch it anyway. Kia catches up to Ahlo and tells him what his father is doing, and so he runs back to the contest, thinking the rocket will kill Toma, and shouts his apology <b>over</b> <b>the</b> loud <b>roaring</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rocket. The Bat is launched properly this time and it reaches the clouds. The Bat then surprisingly explodes inside the cloud, causing it to rain. Ahlo wins 10 million kip and is now no longer considered cursed.|$|R
6000|$|The lobby was full, {{and rather}} dirty, since {{the supply of}} {{spittoons}} was so far behind the demand. Like the firmament, it was divided into little bodies which revolved about larger bodies. But there lacked not here supporters of the Little Giant, and discreet farmers of influence in their own counties who waited to hear the afternoon's debate before deciding. These and others {{did not hesitate to}} tell of the magnificence of the Little Giant's torchlight procession the previous evening. Every Dred-Scottite had carried a torch, and many transparencies, so that the very glory of it had turned night into day. The Chief Lictor had distributed these torches with an unheard-of liberality. But there lacked not detractors who swore that John Dibble and other Lincolnites had applied for torches for the mere pleasure of carrying them. Since dawn the delegations had been heralded from the house-tops, and wagered on while they were yet as worms far out or the prairie. All the morning these continued to came in, and form in line to march past their particular candidate.

50|$|He {{was tried}} on 14 June 1679. He {{was forced to}} defend himself, as a person charged with treason had no right then to defence counsel (this rule was not changed until {{the passage of the}} Treason Act 1695). His main defence {{consisted}} of an attack on the character of the Crown's principal witnesses, Oates and Bedloe, but since the judges were well aware of the deplorable past lives of both men, this seems to have made little impression. He called a number of students from St Omer to prove that Oates had been at the college on crucial dates when he claimed to be in London, but the public mood was so hostile to Catholics that the witnesses were barely able to make themselves heard <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the crowd, and some of them were assaulted as they left the Court. Ironically, some of the same witnesses appeared for the prosecution at Oates' own trial for perjury in 1685, where the crowd treated them courteously, and the jury was told to treat their evidence with the greatest seriousness.|$|E
50|$|When Jack Dempsey met Jess Willard on July 4, 1919, at Toledo, OH, Ryan {{was there}} in the {{capacity}} of betting commissioner for Arnold Rothstein. Dempsey's manager, Doc Kearns, in the company of Damon Runyon, came to Ryan and asked for odds on the chance Dempsey might knock Willard out in the first round. Ryan offered Kearns 10 to 1 odds and Kearns put down a check for $10,000. Dempsey knocked Willard down seven times during the round, and when it ended, Ollie Pecord, the referee, had counted Willard out. Dempsey, at Kearn's urging, leaped from the ring, while Warren Barbour, the official timekeeper, screamed at Dempsey <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> the crowd {{to get back in the}} ring, or he would declare Willard the winner. Barbour claimed that the round had ended when Pecord's count had reached seven; because of noise, and a supposed fouling of the bell cord, no one had heard it clang. Whether of not Barbour was in conspiracy with Ryan to give Willard a chance to survive Dempsey's relentless attack is unknown, but Kearns lost his bet.|$|E
50|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity {{in action}} {{at the risk of}} his life above and beyond the call of duty. Troops B and C, while conducting a reconnaissance mission along a road were suddenly attacked by a Viet Cong regiment, supported by mortars, recoilless rifles and machine guns, from concealed positions astride the road. Sgt. Long abandoned the relative safety of his armored personnel carrier and braved a withering hail of enemy fire to carry wounded men to evacuation helicopters. As the platoon fought its way forward to resupply advanced elements, Sgt. Long repeatedly exposed himself to enemy fire at point blank range to provide the needed supplies. While assaulting the Viet Cong position, Sgt. Long inspired his comrades by fearlessly standing unprotected to repel the enemy with rifle fire and grenades as they attempted to mount his carrier. When the enemy threatened to overrun a disabled carrier nearby, Sgt. Long again disregarded his own safety to help the severely wounded crew to safety. As he was handing arms to the less seriously wounded and reorganizing them to press the attack, an enemy grenade was hurled onto the carrier deck. Immediately recognizing the imminent danger, he instinctively shouted a warning to the crew and pushed to safety one man who had not heard his warning <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> battle. Realizing that these actions would not fully protect the exposed crewmen from the deadly explosion, he threw himself over the grenade to absorb the blast and thereby saved the lives of 8 of his comrades at the expense of his life. Throughout the battle, Sgt. Long's extraordinary heroism, courage and supreme devotion to his men were in the finest tradition of the military service, and reflect great credit upon himself and the U.S. Army.|$|E
60|$|They {{departed}} and Maraton {{returned to}} his sitting-room. He {{stood for a moment}} looking out <b>over</b> <b>the</b> city, <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> which came to him clearly enough through the open window. He forgot the depressing tawdriness of his surroundings in the exhilaration of the sound. He was back again amongst the people, back again where the wheels of life were crashing. The people! He drew himself up and his eyes sought the furthest limits of that dim yellow haze. Somehow, notwithstanding a vague uneasiness which hung about him like an effort of wounded conscience, he had a still greater buoyancy of thought when he considered his possibly altered attitude towards the multitude who waited for his message. He felt his feet upon the earth with more certainty, with more implicit realism, than in those days when he had spoken to them of the future and had perhaps forgotten to tell them how far away that future must be. There was something more practical about his present attitude. What would they say here in Manchester, expecting fire and thunder from his lips and finding him hold out the olive branch? He shrugged his shoulders;--a useless speculation, after all. He rang the bell and glanced through the cards which the waiter brought him.|$|R
6000|$|At length, by mid-afternoon, {{after we}} had had two or three rainbows <b>over</b> <b>the</b> sea, the showers ceased, and the heavens {{gradually}} cleared up, though the wind still blowed as hard and the breakers ran as high as before. Keeping on, we soon after came to a Charity-house, which we looked into {{to see how the}} shipwrecked mariner might fare. Far away in some desolate hollow by the sea-side, just within the bank, stands a lonely building on piles driven into the sand, with a slight nail put through the staple, which a freezing man can bend, with some straw, perchance, on the floor on which he may lie, or which he may burn in the fireplace to keep him alive. Perhaps this hut has never been required to shelter a ship-wrecked man, and the benevolent person who promised to inspect it annually, to see that the straw and matches are here, and that the boards will keep off the wind, has grown remiss and thinks that storms and shipwrecks are over; and this very night a perishing crew may pry open its door with their numbed fingers and leave half their number dead here by morning. When I thought what must be the condition of the families which alone would ever occupy or had occupied them, what must have been the tragedy of the winter evenings spent by human beings around their hearths, these houses, though they were meant for human dwellings, did not look cheerful to me. They appeared but a stage to the grave. The gulls flew around and screamed <b>over</b> them; <b>the</b> <b>roar</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ocean in storms, and the lapse of its waves in calms, alone resounds through them, all dark and empty within, year in, year out, except, perchance, on one memorable night.
