5|$|The Season Four DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Michael comparing Toby to the flu, Toby giving his going-away speech and then being interrupted by Michael, Holly asking Pam if Kevin just ate before jumping in the bounce castle, Jim not sure whether Ryan is going to downsize him, Jim and Pam browsing for apartments online, the revelation that Kevin's band Scrantonicity played 30 full Police songs, all <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> and off-beat, during Phyllis's wedding, Kelly watching Ryan's YouTube arrest video {{over and over again}} at Jim's desk, Jim asking about the website, Troy (Noel Potek)—Ryan's drug dealer—showing up in Scranton.|$|E
5|$|The {{harmonium}} was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> with everything. It wasn't even in {{tune with}} itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from it as much as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E

5000|$|Havens as a live {{performer}} earned widespread notice. His Woodstock {{appearance in}} 1969 catapulted him into stardom {{and was a}} major turning point in his career. As the festivals first performer, he held the crowd for nearly three hours. In part, Havens was told to continue playing, because many artists scheduled to perform after him were delayed in reaching the festival location with highways at a virtual standstill. He was called back for several encores. Having run <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunes,</b> he improvised a song based on the old spiritual [...] "Motherless Child" [...] that became [...] "Freedom". In an interview with Cliff Smith, for Music-Room, he explained: ...|$|R
50|$|The show went great and, since another band {{playing at}} Sweden Rock Festival had a mobile hard disc {{recording}} unit, Christer Wedin {{managed to get}} the Talisman show recorded as well.But the sound Marcel had at the show was not too exciting and some <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tunes</b> guitars needed some fixing. So he and Pontus went into the studio to record live together the entire show exactly the same way they would have done it on stage. The live album was released in October 2002 in Sweden only through Empire Records, charting at number 18 the first week!In the same year, the entire back catalogue of Talisman was re-issued with bonus tracks on Frontline Records in Brazil.|$|R
5|$|Fauré {{was elected}} to the Institut de France in 1909, after his {{father-in-law}} and Saint-Saëns, both long-established members, had canvassed strongly on his behalf. He won the ballot by a narrow margin, with 18 votes against 16 for the other candidate, Widor. In the same year a group of young composers led by Ravel and Koechlin broke with the Société Nationale de Musique, which under the presidency of Vincent d'Indy had become a reactionary organisation, and formed a new group, the Société Musicale Indépendante. While Fauré accepted the presidency of this society, he also remained a member of the older one and continued on the best of terms with d'Indy; his sole concern was the fostering of new music. In 1911 he oversaw the Conservatoire's move to new premises in the rue de Madrid. During this time, Fauré developed serious problems with his hearing. Not only did he start to go deaf, but sounds became distorted, so that high and low notes sounded painfully <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> to him.|$|E
25|$|The first music genre to be {{commonly}} known as honky-tonk music was a style of piano playing related to ragtime but emphasizing rhythm more than melody or harmony; the style evolved {{in response to an}} environment in which the pianos were often poorly cared for, tending to be <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> and having some nonfunctioning keys.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} {{range of}} the whistle is two octaves. For a D whistle, this includes notes from D5 to D7; that is, from the second D above middle C to the fourth D above middle C. It is possible to make sounds above this range, by blowing with sufficient force, but, in most musical contexts, {{the result will be}} loud and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> due to a cylindrical bore.|$|E
50|$|The membranophones {{are also}} an {{important}} part of Uakti's sound, principally the trilobyte, formed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 10 <b>tuned</b> PVC tubes arranged on a frame, with drum skins over the top ends. Two musicians position themselves facing each other, holding the instrument between them, and use their fingers, drum sticks, or the palms of their hands to strike the skins, producing quite rapid melodies.|$|R
500|$|During {{his years}} in Salvador, Gil also {{encountered}} the music of songwriter Dorival Caymmi, who he says represented to him the [...] "beach-oriented" [...] samba music of Salvador. Gonzaga and Caymmi were Gil's formative influences. While in Salvador, Gil was introduced to many other styles of music, including American big band jazz and tango. In 1950 Gil moved back to Salvador with his family. It was there, while still in high school, that he joined his first band, Os Desafinados (The <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tunes),</b> in which he played accordion and vibraphone and sang. Os Desafinados was influenced by American rock and roll musicians like Elvis Presley, as well as singing groups from Rio de Janeiro. The band was active {{for two to three}} years. Soon afterwards, inspired by Brazilian star João Gilberto, he settled on the guitar as his primary instrument and began to play bossa nova.|$|R
50|$|The {{disadvantages}} of a heterodyne bat detector {{are that it}} can only convert a narrow band of frequencies, typically 5 kHz, {{and has to be}} continually retuned, and can easily miss species <b>out</b> <b>of</b> its current <b>tuned</b> range.|$|R
25|$|Many {{traditional}} instruments underwent {{changes in}} the early to mid 20th century which has a profound effect on the performance and sound of Chinese music, and a western equal temperament is now used to tune most traditional instruments, which to modern ears seem less harsh and more harmonious but which also robs the instruments of their traditional voices. To ears now used to hearing modern tunings, even Chinese ones, traditional tunings can sound <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> and discordant.|$|E
25|$|This disc rotates {{at a fixed}} {{specific}} speed, set by the user. Each disc {{rotation speed}} is set to a particular frequency of the desired note. If the note being played (and making the lamps behind the disc flash) is {{at exactly the same}} frequency as the spinning of the disc, then the disc appears to be static (due to the persistence of vision) from the strobing effect. If the note is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> then the pattern appears to be moving as the light flashing and the disc rotation are out of sync from each other. The more <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> the played note is, the faster the pattern seems to be moving, although in reality it always spins at the same speed for a given note. Many good turntables for vinyl disc records have stroboscopic patterns lit by the incoming AC power (mains). The power frequency, either 50 or 60Hz, serves as the reference, although commercial power frequency sometimes changes slightly (a few tenths of a percent) with varying load. Unless reference and measured quantity are interchanged, the operating principle is the same; the turntable speed is adjusted to stop drifting of the pattern.|$|E
25|$|After {{the breakup}} of the Beatles in 1970, Paul taught Linda to play {{keyboards}} and recorded an album with her, Ram, as a duo. Afterwards, he included her in the lineup of his subsequent group, Wings. The group garnered several Grammy Awards, becoming {{one of the most successful}} British bands of the 1970s, but had to endure jibes regarding Linda's singing. She later admitted that the accusations about her singing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> in the early days with Wings were true.|$|E
5000|$|GOASTT often {{finished}} their sets with the Syd Barrett tune [...] "Long Gone" [...] S. Victor Aaron in Something Else Reviews wrote: [...] "The Ghost of A Saber Tooth Tiger brings the full band {{to bear on}} the song, busting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tune’s</b> seams with heavy tones from guitars, Muhl’s organ and Tim Kuhl’s discriminating drums as the song descends into the metal bombast waiting at the end the chorus." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} Thom Jurek states that [...] "As {{is typical of}} Murphy, his {{readings}} <b>of</b> these <b>tunes</b> are seminal. His attention to color and nuance in a ballad like [...] "Summertime" [...] is just plain canny: he seems to coax the emotion <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tune</b> from underneath it, from someplace it was hidden away from view. As Murphy seamlessly changes tempos, keys, and vocal styles without blinking, the poetry gives way to burning scat and improv. A live gig by a master, this is worth seeking out.|$|R
50|$|The {{brochure}} for the 1892 Le Fils des étoiles premiere {{states that}} Satie wrote his score for flutes and harps. Satie's manuscript exists {{only in his}} 1896 piano reduction, with no indication of how the flute and harp parts might have been distributed. In his book Satie the Composer (1990), Robert Orledge pointed <b>out</b> problems <b>of</b> <b>tuning</b> and intonation for the harpists which {{would have made the}} music impractical to play as written, so the nature of its first performance remains a mystery.|$|R
25|$|Often, Vysotsky would {{neglect to}} check the tuning of his guitar, which is {{particularly}} noticeable on earlier recordings. According to some accounts, Vysotsky would get upset when friends would attempt to tune his guitar, leading some {{to believe that he}} preferred to play slightly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> as a stylistic choice. Much of this is also attributable to the fact that a guitar that is tuned down more than 1 whole step (Vysotsky would sometimes tune as much as 2 and a half steps down) is prone to intonation problems.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{there were}} white {{characters}} {{on a black}} background, all of plastic. In 1992, the design was changed to one of black characters on a white background in metal or fibreglass; in that same year, the European blue ribbon was added with the Portuguese 'P' denominator. In 1998, a yellow ribbon {{on the right side}} was added with the month and year in which the car was first registered (e.g. 99/12 for December 1999 - the year comes on top of the month). This is different from systems such as in Germany (where the numbers indicate the start and end month of the vehicle's registration) and more similar to systems such as in Italy (where the date indicates the year of vehicle registration). Note that the date is that of first-ever registration of the vehicle, not the date the vehicle was registered in Portugal. Some vehicles carry plates that have a year and month seemingly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> with the alphanumeric sequence, and {{the reason for this is}} that these are imported used vehicles.|$|E
500|$|Powderfinger’s bass guitarist, John Collins, jokingly {{noted in}} an {{interview}} with Rod Yates of Massive Magazines that [...] "the guitars are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> at the start of Passenger", whilst guitarist Darren Middleton explained that [...] "there are not regrets with any of that sort of stuff, it’s part of who we are and what we’ve done", in reference to the <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> guitars.|$|E
50|$|The song’s {{lyrics and}} melody echoes the {{psychedelic}} vibe of mid-1960s rock music. Micky Dolenz provides the vocals, which are distorted by echoing effect, and {{a mix of}} organ riffs, cello, string-bass, woodwinds and horns float in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tune.</b> The lyrics {{call into question the}} order of the world and one’s place therein, and there are also veiled in-joke references to Dolenz’s childhood work as the star of the television series Circus Boy.|$|R
25|$|The <b>tune</b> is {{reminiscent}} <b>of</b> change ringing, and the intonation of each line {{is said to}} correspond with the distinct sounds of each church's bells. Today, the bells of St. Clement Danes ring <b>out</b> the <b>tune</b> <b>of</b> the rhyme.|$|R
5000|$|Larry Fitzmaurice from Pitchfork Media {{described}} {{the original version}} as a [...] "spiky new-wave tune featuring a particularly angry vocal performance," [...] but commented that the Junior Boys [...] "smooth <b>out</b> some <b>of</b> the <b>tune's</b> rougher edges, morphing Ono's cries into elastic bursts and turning the track into a Danceteria-worthy disco jam." ...|$|R
500|$|In {{his review}} of the Apple Years box set, for Classic Rock magazine, Paul Trynka writes that [...] "The {{surprise}} of this set, though, is the albums whose quietness and introspection were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> with the mid-70s. Dark Horse … [...] packed with beautiful, small-scale moments." [...] While identifying [...] "Simply Shady" [...] and the title track among the standouts, Trynka adds: [...] "Only 'Ding Dong, Ding Dong' embarrasses …" [...] AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine describes Dark Horse as [...] "a mess but … a fascinating one".|$|E
500|$|Crew members often {{complained about}} {{difficult}} shoots, with many quitting or being fired. Mary Parent was then brought in as a producer. Iñárritu stated {{that some of}} the crew members had left the film, explaining that [...] "as a director, if I identify a violin that is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune,</b> I have to take that from the orchestra." [...] On his experience filming, DiCaprio stated: [...] "I can name 30 or 40 sequences that were some of the most difficult things I’ve ever had to do. Whether it’s {{going in and out of}} frozen rivers, or sleeping in animal carcasses, or what I ate on set. [...] enduring freezing cold and possible hypothermia constantly." ...|$|E
500|$|Overall {{reception}} of Final Fantasy IV Celtic Moon was also positive, though some reviewers felt {{that several of}} the tracks were of lesser quality {{than the rest of the}} album. Patrick Gann of RPGFan described it as [...] "Awesome. Purely spectacular." [...] and Matt Brady of Final Fantasy Symphony concurred, saying that the [...] "music quality for this soundtrack was spectacular." [...] Daniel Space of RPGFan, however, found the quality mixed, and said that [...] "some of the pieces do not live up to the new orchestration," [...] although others [...] "were a delight to hear." [...] He also found some of the instruments to be slightly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune,</b> which he disliked, though Matt Brady felt it gave the pieces an [...] "ethnic feel".|$|E
50|$|Both radios used {{vacuum tubes}} and {{employed}} Collins innovations including mechanical filters and permeability tuned oscillators. The latter alters the resonant frequency of a circuit by moving a sintered powder core in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the <b>tuning</b> coil using a lead screw. The KWS-1 final amplifier use {{a pair of}} 4X150 power tubes and operated at a power input of one kilowatt, the maximum allowed under Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulations at the time. The transmitter appearance matched the receiver, but its {{high voltage power supply}} was packaged in a separate pedestal.|$|R
5000|$|Ultimate Guitar Archive {{said about}} the song: [...] "The Empyrean is not like a RHCP's album that is chock-full of {{possible}} hit singles, but the track [...] "Unreachable" [...] does come close. <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> all the <b>tunes,</b> [...] "Unreachable" [...] {{is one of the}} most accessible between the hummable chorus and the infectiously grooving electric piano line." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song [...] "Mysterious Mose" [...] plays {{along with}} the credits, and {{afterwards}} a Porky Pig impostor in Monty Python-esque animation pops <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the Looney <b>Tunes</b> drum. As it tries to utter the line [...] "That's all, Folks!", Bugs punts out the impostor and drags in the real Porky Pig, placing him inside the drum, where he delivers his line.|$|R
500|$|While {{the event}} is {{considered}} a memorable one by several critics, they also agree {{that it was not}} one of the Stones' best performances, and the guitars played during the concert were <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune.</b> In a 1971 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Keith Richards evaluated their performance, [...] "We played pretty bad until near the end, because we hadn't played for years ... Nobody minded, because they just wanted to hear us play again." [...] The Stones' portion of concert was filmed by Granada Television and broadcast that September. It has since been released on DVD and Blu-ray. In April 2013, the band announced their intention to play two return concerts on 6 and 13 July, although the performances were not free.|$|E
500|$|Lead singer Chris Martin wrote [...] "The Scientist" [...] after {{listening}} to George Harrison's [...] "All Things Must Pass". In an interview with Rolling Stone Magazine, Martin revealed that while working on the band's second album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, {{he knew that the}} album was missing something. One night, during a stay in Liverpool, Martin found an old piano that was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune.</b> He wanted to work on Harrison's song, [...] "Isn't It a Pity", but he could not manage to do so. When the song came to Martin, he asked that the recorder be turned on. He concluded by saying that he came across this chord sequence and noted that the chord was [...] "lovely". Martin recorded the vocals and piano takes in a studio in Liverpool.|$|E
500|$|The {{opening track}} [...] "Leaving the City" [...] slowly builds {{up during the}} {{introduction}} and uses <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tune</b> instrumentation and a repetitive chorus. Following [...] "Sinking Feeling", which uses a beat constructed from clicking sounds, is [...] "Night of the Dancing Flame", which combines synthesisers with 1920s jazz. It is written in waltz time and was compared to Stevie Wonder's work during his peak. After opening with noises such as rustling and coughing, the longest track [...] "Through Time" [...] proceeds into a ballad that was compared to those by Carole King. The fifth track [...] "Sow into You" [...] was released as the album's second single. The song uses a metaphor of rain and harvests to describe love and sex, atop a baroque pop brass arrangement. [...] "Dear Diary" [...] is a torch song mixing northern soul with disco music {{with the sounds of}} doorbells and telephones ringing.|$|E
6000|$|They {{went down}} softly, Mab and all, nursed up {{the fire that}} Henry had raked out; and if Saturnalia could be held over the writing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a hymn <b>tune,</b> they did it! At any rate, it had the charm of an {{assertion}} of independence; and to Averil {{it was something like}} a midnight meeting of persecuted Christians--to Leonard it was 'great fun.' ...|$|R
6000|$|SCENE I.--Represents a Chaos, or a {{confused}} Mass of Matter; the Stage [...] is almost wholly dark: A Symphony of warlike Music is heard for some [...] time; {{then from the}} Heavens, (which are opened) fall the rebellious [...] Angels, wheeling in Air, and seeming transfixed with Thunderbolts: [...] The bottom of the Stage being opened, receives the Angels, who fall [...] <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight. <b>Tunes</b> <b>of</b> Victory are played, and an Hymn sung; Angels [...] discovered above, brandishing their Swords: The Music ceasing, and [...] the Heavens being closed, the Scene shifts, and on a sudden [...] represents Hell: Part of the Scene is a Lake of Brimstone, or [...] rolling Fire; the Earth of a burnt Colour: The fallen Angels appear [...] on the Lake, lying prostrate; a <b>Tune</b> <b>of</b> Horror and Lamentation is [...] heard.|$|R
50|$|The filter will self-oscillate (and blow an amplifier), but {{can also}} be scaled 1:1 with {{frequency}} so that the resonator {{can act as a}} 5th oscillator (sine wave). The frequency modulator in the 'EFFECTS' section can be used with the VCF envelope for pitch envelope control. A triangle wave {{can be used as a}} sub-oscillator to beef up the bass of the other oscillators: set a widespread chord in chord memory and then use the arpeggiator, and then switch back and forth between poly/chord memory. The Mono/Poly can be used as a rhythm machine, by setting the instrument in 'Poly' and setting the different footages of the oscillators and the different waveshapes (triangle actually works best), and then using the ring modulator/frequency modulators with the Arpeggiator; adjust the envelopes accordingly to percussive settings and fiddle with the cut-off and noise from time to time to add tone color, and finally, set the LFO to pitch and set it at a considerable amplitude. Further, the pedal inputs can be routed from synths like the Korg MS-20 so that external oscillators can further modulate above what's already available. Because the VCOs have separate tuning controls they tend to be slightly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tuning</b> phase no matter how well they're tuned; to play chords that are in direct tuning phase, play the notes in a rapid, descending order from high to low. Like most analog synthesizers, it tends to scale better from high to low than low to high.|$|R
