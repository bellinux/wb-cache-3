40|$|The use and {{fabrication}} of metallo-organic films are discussed. Metallo-organic compounds are ones {{in which a}} metal is linked to a long chain carbon ligand through a hetero atom such as O, S, N, P or As. Films formed by the thermal decomposition of these metallo-organics are called MOD films. In order that the products of decomposition contain only CO 2, H 2 O, and in rare cases nitrogen compounds, and to avoid S containing products, {{the use of a}} set of metallo-organic compounds for ink fabrication where the linking hetero atom was oxygen was pioneered. These links were made from commercially available carboxylates, or synthesized from commonly available reagents. The processing is described and the molecular design criteria are given.

40|$|The {{difficulty}} in formulating a two component waterborne polyurethane, is the isocyanate-water side reaction, {{which can lead}} to gassing/foaming, loss of isocyanate functionality, low gloss and a reduced pot life. To compensate for this side reaction, these formulations usually contain a large excess of isocyanate. Tin compounds, especially dibutyltin dilaurate, are widely used in coatings as catalysts for the isocyanate/hydroxyl reaction. Because of the high aquatic toxicity of some organotin compounds, there has been an attempt to ban organotin compounds from all coating applications. As a general rule, organotin catalysts are not selective, they catalyze the reaction of isocyanates with both hydroxyl groups and water and also catalyze the hydrolysis of ester groups. One novel approach to control the water side reaction is the use of catalysts which selectively catalyze the isocyanate-polyol reaction and not the isocyanate-water reaction. The selectivity of a variety of metal catalysts (metal <b>octoates,</b> metal acetylacetonates and mangan chelates with mixed ligands) to catalyze the preferred reaction was measured using the FTIR method...|$|R

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{synthesis}} {{used to produce}} a high molecular weight form of the polymer is ring-opening polymerization of [...] "glycolide", the cyclic diester of glycolic acid. Glycolide can be prepared by heating under reduced pressure low MW PGA, collecting the diester by means of distillation. Ring-opening polymerization of glycolide can be catalyzed using different catalysts, including antimony compounds, such as antimony trioxide or antimony trihalides, zinc compounds (zinc lactate) and tin compounds like stannous <b>octoate</b> (tin(II) 2-ethylhexanoate) or tin alkoxides. Stannous <b>octoate</b> is {{the most commonly used}} initiator, since it is approved by the FDA as a food stabilizer. Usage of other catalysts has been disclosed as well, among these are aluminium isopropoxide, calcium acetylacetonate, and several lanthanide alkoxides (e.g. yttrium isopropoxide). The procedure followed for ring-opening polymerization is briefly outlined: a catalytic amount of initiator is added to glycolide under a nitrogen atmosphere at a temperature of 195 °C. The reaction is allowed to proceed for about two hours, then temperature is raised to 230 °C for about half an hour. After solidification the resulting high MW polymer is collected.|$|E

Ethanol initiated the polymer-ization of c-caprolactone producing a polymer with c-caprolactone derived hydroxyl end groups which after addition of 1,-lactide in the second step of the polymerization initiated the ring-opening copolymerization of L-lactide. The number-average molecular weights of the poly(c-caprolactone) blocks varied from 1. 5 to 5. 2 X 10 a, while those of the poly(l. -lactide) blocks ranged from 17. 4 to 49. 7 X 10 s. The polydispersities of the block copolymers varied from 1. 16 to 1. 27. The number-average molecular weights of the polymers were controlled by the monomer/hydroxyl group ratio, and were independent on the monomer/ stannous <b>octoate</b> ratio {{within the range of}} experimental conditions studied. When L-lactide was polymerized first, followed by copolymerization of c-caprolactone, random copolymers were obtained. The formation of random copolymers was attributed to the occurrence of transesterification reactions.
