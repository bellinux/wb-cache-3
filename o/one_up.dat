5|$|It was {{something}} we wanted to wrap {{up to a certain}} extent. It's a disservice to Rick's character to make him look like he's completely clueless. But this isn't really a resolution per se. It makes things a little bit more tense, moving into this next episode. Seeing Rick interact with Shane will have an extra level of tension because now the audience has <b>one</b> <b>up</b> on Shane as opposed to <b>one</b> <b>up</b> on Rick. It’s going to be fun waiting for the other shoe to drop, when Rick may or may not confront Shane with this information.|$|E
5|$|In the Standard Model of physics, {{electrons}} {{are truly}} elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks. There {{are two types}} of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +) and one down quark (with a charge of −). Neutrons consist of <b>one</b> <b>up</b> quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.|$|E
5|$|Unlike some finch species, the American {{goldfinch}} {{uses its}} feet extensively in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding {{in order to}} reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American goldfinch feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling <b>one</b> <b>up</b> with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.|$|E

5|$|Del Potro {{played in}} the Davis Cup Final, with the title {{on the line and}} looking to fulfill his {{childhood}} dream. He lost in the second rubber to David Ferrer, despite being two sets to <b>one</b> <b>up,</b> eventually losing in a pulsating five-set contest in a match lasting over five hours. With his country down 2–1, del Potro needed to beat Rafael Nadal in the reverse singles to keep the tie going. Del Potro dominated the first set, but could not keep his level up and lost in four sets. For the third time in six years, Argentina lost in the finals of the Davis Cup World Group, this time 3–1.|$|E
5|$|Gameplay in Guitar Hero 5 {{is similar}} to {{previous}} games in the series. Using a special game controller, players attempt to match scrolling notes as they appear on screen along a note track to mimic the playing of rock music and other songs. Hitting correct notes {{in time with the}} music increases the player's score and builds up the performance meter, while missing notes will cause the meter to drop. Should the meter fall below a certain threshold, the song will end prematurely with the player booed off the stage by a virtual audience. Correctly hitting ten consecutive notes will add to the player's score multiplier by <b>one,</b> <b>up</b> to a maximum of four times the original multiplier. Specially marked sections of the song, if completed correctly, help to build up Star Power, which can then be activated through an action with the controller to further double the current multiplier (up to 8x).|$|E
5|$|The Proposal was {{released}} in the United States on June 19, 2009. On its opening day, the film grossed an estimated $12.7 million in 3,056 theaters, becoming the highest-grossing film of the day. It later went on to gross over $34 million during its opening weekend, beating out Year <b>One,</b> <b>Up,</b> and The Hangover. In an exit poll conducted by Disney, nearly 63% of the opening audience consisted of female viewers, 78% were eighteen or older, and 71% were classified as couples. It marked the biggest opening weekend out of any film in Bullock's career, nearly doubling from her previous holder, Premonition. As of October 2011, the film had grossed over $164 million in the United States and Canada.|$|E

25|$|The {{down quark}} is a first-generation quark with {{a charge of}} −. It is the second-lightest of all the six of quarks, the lightest being the up quark. Down quarks are most {{commonly}} found in nucleons. Its protons contains one down quark and two up quarks, while neutrons contain two down quarks and <b>one</b> <b>up</b> quark. Down quarks were theorized by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig when they discovered the quark model in 1968.|$|E
25|$|In the quarter-finals, France faced three-time world {{champion}} Brazil in Guadalajara.

Five minutes before half-time, France drew level when Michel Platini scored his 41st goal after converting a cross from Dominique Rocheteau.

25|$|The parish {{church is}} {{dedicated}} to Saint Cadoc. It contains some interesting features which can definitely be assigned to pre-reformation times, the chancel arch being in the early perpendicular style of the 14th century. Other features are of 14th-, 15th- and 16th-century perpendicular with 19th-century alterations. There is a row of six cottages just {{to the north of}} the church that were built in 1817 as almshouses from a bequest of £50 from Earl Talbot of Hensol and £50 from one Philip John. They were of very basic <b>one</b> <b>up</b> one down plus kitchen construction with a fireplace stair. No. 1 was subsequently rebuilt as a school.|$|E

25|$|In most Persian rugs, {{the field}} of the rug is {{surrounded}} by stripes, or borders. These may number from <b>one</b> <b>up</b> to over ten, but usually there is one wider main border surrounded by minor, or guardian borders. The main border is often filled with complex and elaborate rectilinear or curvilinear designs. The minor border stripes show simpler designs like meandering vines. The traditional Persian border arrangement was highly conserved through time, but can also be modified {{to the effect that}} the field encroaches on the main border. This feature is often seen in Kerman rugs from the late nineteenth century, and was likely taken over from French Aubusson or Savonnerie weaving designs.|$|E
25|$|Tony Blair had in 1993, before {{becoming}} Leader of the Labour Party, written a pamphlet for the Fabian Society which criticised {{the wording of}} Clause IV for not clearly stating the means and ends of the party. Blair put forward a case for defining socialism {{in terms of a}} set of values which were constant, while the policies needed to achieve them would have to account for changing society. After becoming Leader, he announced at the conclusion of his 1994 conference speech that the Labour Party needed a new statement of aims and values and that he would draw <b>one</b> <b>up</b> and present it to the party. This astonished many people, as the last time such a move had been taken (by Hugh Gaitskell in the late 1950s), it had been a failure.|$|E
25|$|Also {{included}} is {{an example}} of tunnel back to backs which were built in large numbers in Bowling after the 1866 bylaw change. The tunnel gave access to the rear two houses and a group of four privies. Most such houses exceeded the bylaw minimum (the 1870 bylaw still permitted construction of the <b>one</b> <b>up</b> and one down) by including a side scullery and often a small front garden. In the example in the table the ground floor had a good size living room and a side scullery with access to the tunnel. Such houses had either two or three bedrooms, the third being in a flying free hold over the tunnel. Even the three-bedroom type was considerably smaller than the type 3 Ripley Ville house.|$|E
