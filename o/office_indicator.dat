Three methods for extracting a signal are considered: a simple mechanical rule based upon the direction of consecutive movements in the leading indicator and two probabilistic models, namely a standard Bayesian procedure and the sequential probability model. The results suggest that usefulness of the shorter leading index is limited and typically outperformed by naive, nonindicator methods. The longer leading index performs only slightly better showing a lead time of between four and six months in relation to the reference cycle. Coauthors are Robin C. Bladen-Hovell, Denise R.

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis {{of just over}} 20, 000 patients (greater {{than or equal to}} 18 years of age) who visited providers 2 ̆ 7 offices during 9 -day periods in 1986. Patient- and physician-provided information was obtained by self-administered questionnaires. SETTING: Offices of 349 physicians practicing family medicine, internal medicine, endocrinology, and cardiology within health maintenance organizations, large multispecialty groups, and solo practices or small single-specialty group practices in three major US cities. OUTCOME MEASURES: Indicators of the intensity of resource utilization were examined among four medical specialties (family practice, general internal medicine, cardiology, and endocrinology) and five systems of care (health maintenance organization, multispecialty group-fee-for-service, multispecialty group-prepaid; solo practice and single-specialty group-fee-for-service, and solo practice and single-specialty group-prepaid) before and after controlling for the mix of patients seen in these <b>offices.</b> The <b>indicators</b> of resource utilization were hospitalizations, annual office visits, prescription drugs, and common tests and procedures, with rates estimated on both a per-visit and per-year basis. RESULTS: Variation in patient mix was a major determinant of the large variations in resource use.

40|$|A {{number of}} authors deal with {{problems}} of convergence, divergence and disparities, particularly with reference to economic growth and its comparison in groups of countries. This paper is aimed at problems of using basic methods of measuring the convergence at {{the evaluation of the}} development of selected demographic characteristics of particular regions of the Czech Republic for the period 1992 to 2007. From demographic data provided by the Czech Statistical <b>Office</b> some <b>indicators</b> were selected associated with aging the CR population. In particular, following indicators were used: the proportion of productive population, coefficient of loading the productive population by young persons, coefficient of loading the productive population by old persons, coefficient of the total loading and index of age. A precondition served as a working hypothesis that in addition to the negative demographic development affecting the CR as a whole, the convergence of its particular regions also occurred, viz. regions at the level of NUTS 3. At the quantification of convergence processes in particular regions of the CR, the method of beta convergence was used (in a simplified linearized form) as well as the method of sigma convergence. Both methods predicate unambiguously on the convergence of the CR regions {{from the point of view}} of all examined demographic indicators. From the aspect of both methods, the fastest convergence occurred in the studied period in the indicator of loading the productive population by old persons. In this indicator (as the only from monitored ones), no disparity showed as well, ie a region showing an isolated development was not noted. Opposite situation manifested itself at the indicator of loading the productive population by young persons. Only elimination of the capital city of Prague reversed an original result showing evidence of the divergence of regions from the aspect of this indicator. Disparities of the capital city of Prague occurred even at other two indicators. Only from the aspect of age, the Central Bohemian region became a region being beside the general trend of convergence...|$|R

The purpose behind such an index is in this study the development and the validation of a social vulnerability map of population characteristics towards river-floods covering all counties in Germany. This map {{is based on a}} composite index of three main indicators for social vulnerability in Germany – fragility, socio-economic conditions and region. These indicators have been identified by a factor analysis of selected demographic variables obtained from federal statistical <b>offices.</b> Therefore, these <b>indicators</b> can be updated annually based on a reliable data source. The vulnerability patterns detected by the factor analysis are verified by using an independent second data set. The interpretation of the second data set shows that vulnerability is revealed by a real extreme flood event and demonstrates that the patterns of the presumed vulnerability match the observations of a real event. It comprises a survey of flood-affected households in three federal states. By using logistic regression, it is demonstrated that the theoretically presumed indications of vulnerability are correct and that the indicators are valid. It is shown that indeed certain social groups like the elderly, the financially weak or the urban residents are higher risk groups...|$|R

We aimed to explore integrated urinary biomarkers, assessing the overall urine genotoxicity by in vitro comet and micronucleus assays and measuring urinary 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine. Methods During three consecutive working days, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds were sampled in workplace air of 34 sewage and 30 <b>office</b> workers, as <b>indicators</b> of airborne exposure. The last day, subjects collected their 24 hours urine. Genotoxicity of urinary extracts was assessed by comet and micronucleus assays on a HepG 2 cell line. Using competitive enzymatic immunoassay we evaluated the 24 hours urinary 8 -oxo- 2 '-deoxyguanosine excretion. Benzo(a) pyrene toxicity equivalent factors and inhalation unit risk for Benzo(a) pyrene and benzene were used to give an estimate of cancer risk levels.

40|$|The {{study is}} an {{evaluation}} of how Merseyside Police attempted to narrow the Black and Racial Minority (BRM) satisfaction gap, {{as measured by the}} Home <b>Office</b> performance <b>indicator.</b> The research considers the sense with which both police officers and, more importantly, victims made of the policies and processes used. It asks whether this activity resulted in an improvement to the service being provided, therefore benefitting the victim, or in the construction of performance data thereby benefitting the organisation. The research was undertaken between 2011 and 2015 and completed as a case study. It involved the views of those people within Merseyside Police who were responsible for the design and implementation of policy along, with some of those responsible for delivering the service to the public. The research also includes the narrative of victims who had taken part in Merseyside Police’s monthly victim satisfaction survey. The BRM satisfaction gap was initially proposed by the Macpherson Report, which had examined the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence. It was one of ten performance indicators intending to monitor and assess whether trust and confidence in the police was improving within BRM communities. Previous research had identified factors other than the quality of police contact as influencing a person’s level of satisfaction. However, this research shows how the BRM satisfaction gap was treated as a single subject by Merseyside Police, who chose to focus purely on service delivery to improve victim satisfaction. Warnings regarding statistical relevance of the BRM satisfaction gap, along with concerns as to whether the victim satisfaction survey was fit for purpose, were ignored in their efforts to ensure the performance indicator was on target. The research highlights how New Public Management (NPM) principles of performance management were used to produce organisational focus and develop a system which closely tracked the service provided to BRM victims by individual officers. However, it shows that although it resulted in a good knowledge amongst senior officers, this was not embedded amongst those delivering the service. Instead, reporting officers developed their own working practices to deliver Merseyside Police’s required ‘Gold Service’ to BRM victims, whilst many victims remained confused and frustrated with the service provided. Merseyside Police did statistically narrow the BRM satisfaction gap. However, the research highlights the influence of performance construction and questions whether the recorded improvement in performance was as result of an improved service or was manufactured by gaming techniques. Although the BRM satisfaction gap was intended to measure trust and confidence, the research concludes this was never a consideration for Merseyside Police who, instead, focussed their efforts on improving their performance indicator...|$|R
40|$|Background & Objective : Assessing students’ {{grades in}} their courses and in {{national}} comprehensive exams may {{help us in}} the assessment of educational status of different departments indirectly. In this study, the internal consistency of medical students’ scores in Kerman University of Medical Sciences was assessed. Methods : In a historical cohort study, students’ grades and other information for entrance years between 1995 and 2003 were extracted from the central admission <b>office</b> and 10 <b>indicators</b> for educational achievement were defined for each student. Having used Cronbach's alpha and linear regression, we checked the internal consistency of scores. Also, we used factorial analysis and related graphs (Dendrogram) to evaluate the consistency between factors of students’ educational achievement. Results : Females were more successful in all series of students except for national comprehensive exams. Although internal consistency in males’ scores was more than females’, males’ scores in specific courses of basic sciences were more related to the scores of their basic sciences comprehensive exams. In addition, internal consistency in males’ scores was more than females’ especially in clinical courses. Higher age at entering university could cause a decrease in educational success. Students’ grades in various courses had slight consistency with national comprehensive exams. Moreover, the internal consistency of scores during clerkship and internship were significantly lower than the other phases. Conclusion : Lower consistency of scores in clinical courses may imply lower validity of these scores. Unlike higher educational success in females, it seems that stability in males’ scores was greater in most indicators.

40|$|The {{quality of}} office indoor environments is {{considered}} to consist of those factors that impact occupants according to their health and well-being and (by consequence) their productivity. Indoor Environment Quality (IEQ) can be characterized by four indicators: • Indoor air quality indicators • Thermal comfort indicators • Lighting indicators • Noise indicators. Within each indicator, there are specific metrics that can be utilized in determining an acceptable quality of an indoor environment based on existing knowledge and best practice. Examples of these metrics are: indoor air levels of pollutants or odorants; operative temperature and its control; radiant asymmetry; task lighting; glare; ambient noise. The way in which these metrics impact occupants is not fully understood, especially when multiple metrics may interact in their impacts. While the potential cost of lost productivity from poor IEQ has been estimated to exceed building operation costs, the level of impact and the relative significance of the above four indicators are largely unknown. However, they are key factors in the sustainable operation or refurbishment of office buildings. This paper presents a methodology for assessing indoor environment quality (IEQ) in <b>office</b> buildings, and <b>indicators</b> with related metrics for high performance and occupant comfort. These are intended for integration into the specification of sustainable office buildings as key factors to ensure {{a high degree of}} occupant habitability, without this being impaired by other sustainability factors. The assessment methodology was applied in a case study on IEQ in Australia’s first ‘six star’ sustainable office building, Council House 2 (CH 2), located in the centre of Melbourne. The CH 2 building was designed and built with specific focus on sustainability and the provision of a high quality indoor environment for occupants. Actual IEQ performance was assessed in this study by field assessment after construction and occupancy. For comparison, the methodology was applied to a 30 year old conventional building adjacent to CH 2 which housed the same or similar occupants and activities. The impact of IEQ on occupant productivity will be reported in a separate future pape...|$|R
