They are usually made by {{combining}} sugar (often brown), butter, cream or buttermilk, and pecans {{in a pot}} <b>over</b> <b>medium-high</b> <b>heat,</b> and stirring constantly until most of the water has evaporated and it has reached a thick texture with a brown color. This is then usually dropped by spoonfuls onto wax paper or a sheet of aluminum foil greased with butter, and left to cool.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Plateau Rosa Alpine station (Italy) has {{collected}} atmospheric concentrations {{of carbon dioxide}} since 1989. If the complete set of hourly data is observed, two distinct and exceptional very high concentration events are evident for February 2004. Similar and almost contemporary peaks were registered at the European high–altitude stations of Zugspitze–Schneefernerhaus and Sonnblick in the Alps, and at Mt. Cimone in the Northern Apennines. A regional meteorological model (the Weather Research and Forecast) was applied <b>over</b> a <b>medium–high</b> resolution grid to study {{the evolution of the}} meteorological fields and to identify the trajectories of the polluted air masses during the CO 2 observed peaks. The results show that, during both episodes, atmospheric circulation conveyed highly polluted air from the European plains to the Alpine stations. This conclusion has been also confirmed through concentration measurements of the atmospheric trace gases in the same area...|$|R
40|$|In {{marine and}} power {{generation}} sectors, {{waste heat recovery}} technologies are attracting growing atten- tion {{in order to increase}} heavy duty diesel engines efficiency and decrease fuel consumption, with the purpose of respecting stringent emissions legislations. In this work, the backpressure effect of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) evaporator on the exhaust line of a turbocharged, V 12 heavy duty diesel engine, for typical marine and power generation applications has been investigated using the commercial software Ricardo WAVE. Three different state-of-the art turbocharging strategies are assessed in order to counterbalance the increased pumping losses of the engine due to the boiler installation: fixed turbine, Waste-Gate (WG) and Variable Geometry Turbine (VGT). At the same time, the steady-state thermodynamic performance of two different ORC configurations, simple tail-pipe evaporator and recuperated simple tail-pipe evaporator layouts, are assessed, with the scope of further increasing the engine power output, recovering unutilized exhaust gas heat. Several different working fluids, suitable for <b>medium-high</b> temperature waste <b>heat</b> recovery, are evaluated and screened, considering, as well, health and safety issues. Thermodynamic cycle parameters such as, for example, evaporation and condensing pressures, working fluid mass flow and cycle temperatures, are optimized in order to obtain the maximum improvement in Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (bsfc). From the engine side point of view, a VGT turbocharger is the most favorable solution to withstand increased backpressure, while, regarding the ORC side, between the considered fluids and layouts, acetone and a recuperated cycle show the most promising performance...|$|R
