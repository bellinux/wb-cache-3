Later in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict Leonidas, a {{relative}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> by Lysimachus of Acarnania. Alexander {{was raised in the}} manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read, play the lyre, ride, fight, and hunt.|$|E
5|$|Raymond {{was born}} on 10 May 1888, in Kladno, Central Bohemia (now the Czech Republic) to Alois Reimann and his wife Růžena.

Raymond started at the Reálné gymnasium (secondary school aimed at more technical/practical sciences) in Kladno, then continued on the same kind of school in Prague.|$|E
5|$|The {{adolescent}} Caligula {{was then}} sent {{to live with his}} great-grandmother (and Tiberius's mother) Livia. After her death, he was sent to live with his grandmother Antonia. In 30 AD, his brother, Drusus Caesar, was imprisoned on charges of treason and his brother Nero died in exile from either starvation or suicide. Suetonius writes that after the banishment <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> brothers, Caligula and his sisters were nothing more than prisoners of Tiberius under the close watch of soldiers.|$|E
50|$|Remington Schuyler (1884-1955) was an American painter, {{illustrator}} {{and writer}} {{during the early}} to mid twentieth century.

He began his {{baseball}} career there in 1911 as a catcher with Fred Palace's Colts, a semipro team composed mostly of teenagers. Also joining the Colts that season was Dick Whitworth, who would, like Rogan, go on to pitch for many years in the Negro leagues.|$|E
5|$|A coming-of-age story, Forward Unto Dawn {{follows a}} cadet, Thomas Lasky, at a twenty-sixth century {{military}} training academy {{as it is}} attacked by the Covenant, a religious alliance of aliens.

Lasky and his surviving squad mates are rescued by the Master Chief and, {{after the death of his}} romantic interest, Chyler Silva, Lasky is inspired by the Chief to take initiative and aids him in saving the remaining cadets.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{historians have}} had mostly {{negative}} assessments of Ivan Shishman. He is {{often viewed as}} having intruded onto the throne due to the intrigues <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> thus taking {{the place of the}} rightful successor, his elder brother Ivan Sratsimir. This eventually resulted in the division of the country {{on the eve of the}} Ottoman invasion. There are no direct historical sources to suggest any significant attempts by Ivan Shishman to fight off the Turks. The inconsistent policy of Ivan Shishman has been described as revealing his weakness and inability to cope with the situation. His rule, however, was still remembered in the 16th century. In a treaty signed in 1519 between the Ottoman sultan Selim I and Louis II of Hungary, some of the lands in question were referred to as terra cesaris Sysman, “the land of emperor Shishman”.|$|E
50|$|He {{also wrote}} a book about Eleonora Duse, who was a friend <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother's</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> sister's God <b>mother.</b> He {{translated}} the plays of Luigi Pirandello from Italian, at the same time working as a movie actor and as a theatre director. Co-stars included Lotte Lenya, Peter Lorre, Fritz Kortner, Theo Lingen, Heinz Rühmann and Paul Hörbiger.|$|R

5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to be generous in spirit, though many were {{political}} in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were a thing of the past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile. He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected and brought back the bones <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|In 1892 Rimsky-Korsakov {{suffered}} a second creative drought, {{brought on by}} bouts of depression and alarming physical symptoms. Rushes of blood to the head, confusion, memory loss and unpleasant obsessions led to a medical diagnosis of neurasthenia. Crises in the Rimsky-Korsakov household {{may have been a}} factor—the serious illnesses of his wife and one of his sons from diphtheria in 1890, the deaths <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> youngest child, as well as the onset of the prolonged, ultimately fatal illness of his second youngest child. He resigned from the Russian Symphony Concerts and the Court Chapel and considered giving up composition permanently. After making third versions of the musical tableau Sadko and the opera The Maid of Pskov, he closed his musical account with the past; he had left none of his major works before May Night in their original form.|$|E
5|$|Krichell's next {{target was}} second baseman Snuffy Stirnweiss from the University of North Carolina. He {{initially}} {{tried to convince}} him to bypass football for baseball, but the player refused until his father's death soon after his college graduation altered his priorities, leaving him as the sole supporter <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> younger brother. Krichell signed him to a contract soon afterwards. In a mass tryout for the Yankees team, Krichell scouted first baseman Whitey Ford. Krichell realised Ford had a strong arm, and recommended he tried pitching. Developing an effective fast curveball, Ford helped his team win the New York City sandlot ball championship, and was signed by Krichell for $7,000 in 1947 ($ in 2010). Ford later became a Hall of Famer and an ace of the Yankees {{for most of the}} 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Leonardo's early life. He spent his first {{five years in the}} hamlet of Anchiano in the home <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>and</b> from 1457 lived in the {{household}} of his father, grandparents and uncle {{in the small town of}} Vinci. His father had married a sixteen-year-old girl named Albiera Amadori, who loved Leonardo but died young in 1465 without children. When Leonardo was sixteen (1468), his father married again to twenty-year-old Francesca Lanfredini, who also died without children. Piero's legitimate heirs were born from his third wife Margherita di Guglielmo (who gave birth to six children: Antonio, Giulian, Maddalena, Lorenzo, Violante and Domenico) and his fourth and final wife, Lucrezia Cortigiani (who bore him another six children: Margherita, Benedetto, Pandolfo, Guglielmo, Bartolomeo and Giovanni).|$|E
5|$|O'Connell {{was born}} to {{distinguished}} lawyer Charles O'Connell in 1849 in Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, some {{two years after the}} death of his famed grand-uncle Daniel O'Connell. Young O'Connell attended Belvedere College, a Jesuit school in Dublin, but was called home at the deaths <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> sister in a coach accident. This tragic event was later judged to be the source of O'Connell's sense of the impermanence of the world. After the funeral, he was transferred without enthusiasm to Clongowes Wood College where he studied the classics for three years. O'Connell signed on with the Royal Navy as a midshipman. He travelled around Cape Horn to California in 1868.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, 13-year-old Sanford Clark {{was taken}} {{from his home in}} Saskatchewan (with the {{permission}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> reluctant father) by his uncle, 19-year-old Gordon Stewart Northcott. Northcott took Clark to a ranch in Wineville, California, where he regularly beat and sexually abused the boy — until , when the police took Clark into custody after his sister, 19-year-old Jessie Clark, informed them of the situation. Clark revealed that he was forced to help Northcott and his mother, Sarah Louise Northcott, in killing three young boys after Northcott had kidnapped and molested them. The police found no bodies at the ranch — Clark said they were dumped in the desert — but discovered body parts, blood-stained axes, and personal effects belonging to missing children. The Northcotts fled to Canada, but were arrested and extradited to the United States. Sarah Louise initially confessed to murdering Walter Collins, she later retracted her statement; Gordon, who had confessed to killing five boys, did likewise.|$|E

5|$|Shaw wrote The Christening, {{his only}} novel, in 1975. It centres around Miles Madgwick, who {{believes}} that he is bisexual but is too timid to find out through physical intercourse, so he instead describes his most intimate thoughts in his diary. He then meets a married woman named Alice and her son, Rodney; he comes to identify with Rodney's childhood innocence, and in Alice sees a symbol both <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> a heterosexual lover. Alice starts to tire {{of her husband and}} grow fonder of Madgwick, who experiences mixed emotions in his continued interactions with her and Rodney. One night, Rodney stays overnight at Madgwick's house and, when he takes the boy home in a taxicab, the driver observes their strange behaviour and accuses Madgwick of being a pederast. When Alice asks Madgwick to become the godfather to her new child, the driver threatens to expose Madgwick, creating a conflict between losing his first feelings of intimacy with others or facing humiliation and ridicule at the driver's exposure.|$|E
5|$|The {{reconciliation}} of Stephen {{and his father}} was only temporary. Stephen confiscated the domains <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> sister, Annaincluding Beszterce (present-day Bistrița, Romania) and Füzérwhich were located in the lands under his rule. Béla IV's army crossed the Danube under Anna's command after 1 August 1264. She besieged and took Sárospatak and seized Stephen's wife and children. Voivode Ladislaus Kán turned against Stephen and led an army, which consisted of Cuman warriors, to Transylvania. Stephen routed him at the fort of Déva (now Deva, Romania). King Béla's Judge royal, Lawrence arrived {{at the head of}} a new army and forced Stephen to retreat to Feketehalom (now Codlea, Romania). The Judge royal lay siege to the fortress, but Stephen's partisans relieved it. Stephen launched a counter-offensive and forced his father's army to retreat. He gained a decisive victory over his father's army in the Battle of Isaszeg in March 1265. The two archbishops mediated a new consolidation between father and son, which confirmed the 1262 division of the country. Béla and Stephen signed the peace treaty in the Convent of the Blessed Virgin on the Rabbits' Island (now Margaret Island in Budapest) on 23 March 1266.|$|E
5|$|While Shekhar {{is off to}} Darjeeling on a {{business}} trip, Naveen Roy violently thunders at Lalita {{about the loss of}} his hotel project, embarrassing and humiliating her. Roy gets a wall built between his and Gurcharan’s house symbolising the end of their association. Gurcharan, unable to digest this, suffers a heart attack. Upon Shekhar’s return, Roy informs him of the ill-health <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> <b>and</b> Gurcharan and viciously adds a note of Lalita and Girish’s marriage. Shekhar is disgusted to hear of the marriage and in his anger he scowls at Lalita, humiliating her like his father. Meanwhile, Girish assists Gurcharan's family and takes them to London for the heart treatment. Misunderstandings follow and upon the family’s return from London, Shekhar assumes that Girish and Lalita are married and agrees to marry Gayatri. The film returns to the night of Shekhar’s marriage when Girish hands him the ownership papers of Gurcharan’s haveli. He shocks Shekhar by telling him that he got married to Koel because Lalita denied his marriage proposal. As a conclusion, Shekhar confronts his father and symbolically breaks down the wall separating the two families. He then brings Lalita to his home as his bride much to the delight of his mother.|$|E
