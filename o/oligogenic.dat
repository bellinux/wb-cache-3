Elucidating the principles of <b>oligogenic</b> inheritance and mechanisms of genetic interactions could help unravel the newly appreciated role of rare sequence variants in polygenic disorders. With few exceptions, however, the precise genetic architecture of <b>oligogenic</b> diseases remains unknown. Isolated gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency caused by defective secretion or action of hypothalamic GnRH is a rare genetic disease that manifests as sexual immaturity and infertility. Recent reports of patients who harbor pathogenic rare variants {{in more than one}} gene have challenged the long-held view that the disorder is strictly monogenic, yet the frequency and extent of oligogenicity in isolated GnRH deficiency have not been investigated. By systematically defining genetic variants in large cohorts of well-phenotyped patients (n = 397), family members, and unaffected subjects (n = 179) for the majority of known disease genes, this study suggests a significant role of oligogenicity in this disease. Remarkably, oligogenicity in isolated GnRH deficiency was as frequent as homozygosity/compound heterozygosity at a single locus (2. 5 %). Among the 22 % of patients with detectable rare protein-altering variants, the likelihood of oligogenicity was 11. 3 %. No oligogenicity was detected among controls (P < 0. 05), even though deleterious variants were present.

The simulation showed an overall decrease in the accuracy of total genomic predictions as dominance increases, regardless of the method used for prediction.

When the ratio of dominance to total phenotypic variance reached 0. 2, the additive?dominance prediction models were significantly better than the additive-only models.

Populations consisting of 200, 500 and 1, 000 individuals were employed and 100 repetitions performed for each population size.

The IM was efficient at detecting OTL in all evaluated characteristics; however, for characteristics determined by two genes with effects between 40 and 50 %, the OTMM was more efficient at detecting and localizing OTL in simulated marks. In contrast, the IM method was more efficient at detecting and localizing OTL in simulated marks when the gene effect ranged from 10 to 30 %.

We present a comprehensive analysis of the spectrum, distribution, and involvement in non-Mendelian trait transmission of mutant alleles in BBS 1, the most common BBS locus. Analyses of 259 independent families segregating a BBS phenotype indicate that BBS 1 participates in complex inheritance and that, in different families, mutations in BBS 1 can interact genetically with mutations at each of the other known BBS genes, as well as at unknown loci, to cause the phenotype.

The recognition of an association between two RFLPs at the {{transforming growth factor alpha}} (TGFA) locus and CL/P supports a major-gene component to the etiology of CL/P.
