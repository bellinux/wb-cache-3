50|$|The play {{tells the}} story of a young black woman named Sarah who lives in New York City. The play focuses on Sarah's {{internal}} struggle with her racial identity. She spends a great deal of time grappling with her feelings about her mixed ancestry—she worships her white mother and despises her black father. In order to demonstrate this complicated mental battle, Kennedy transforms the stage into a manifestation <b>of</b> <b>Sarah's</b> mind, and she uses various historical figures as representations <b>of</b> <b>Sarah's</b> black and white heritage. These character's are described as extensions <b>of</b> <b>Sarah's</b> self. The figures include Queen Victoria, the Duchess of Hapsburg, Patrice Lumumba, and Jesus Christ.|$|R

5|$|Fowles's {{presentation}} <b>of</b> <b>Sarah,</b> one of {{the most}} enigmatic female characters in literary history, is also psychoanalytically informed. Fowles himself was interested in the psychology of men and women.The enigma of femininity, myth of masculinity, and impossibility of man-woman relationship are some of the crucial themes. Through Sarah's deliberate spreading of lies about herself and her relationship with Charles, Fowles brilliantly brings about the various aspects of femininity that has the potential to authenticate, threaten, and expose the vanity of the male subjects.|$|E

5|$|Sam Black (Gabrielle Anwar) {{replaced}} Julie as {{the head}} of the graphics team in the second series.

(Many actors who unsuccessfully auditioned for main characters were invited back later for guest roles.) Moffat had expanded the role of Julie after the first series, but Lucy Benjamin was unavailable for series two. Sam, therefore, was basically the character of Julie under a different name, especially in her earlier episodes.|$|E
