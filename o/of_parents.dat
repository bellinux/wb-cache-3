40|$|ABSTRACT Background There {{are lots}} of factors {{influence}} the type <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> style (democratic, permissive, and authoritarian) including parent's psychological condition. Anxiety is a psychological condition that {{can be derived from}} parent to child. Thus, anxiety in childhood can probably exist until adulthood and may affect the incorrect type <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> style. Aim To determine the association between anxiety with type <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> style in mothers who send their children to homeschooling. Methods This was a descriptive analytic study with cross sectional design. The sampleswere 62 mothers suitable with inclusion and exclusion criteria, who sent their children to Zidni, Primagama, and ANSA Semaranghomeschooling. Respondents’ anxiety level was measured by Zung Anxiety Questionnairewhile their type <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> was measured by type of parentingquestionnaire. The analysis used chi-square, Kruska Wallis, Mann Whitney, and Spearman Test. Results There was a significant difference in Zung anxiety scores among the types <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> (p = 0. 014). Besides, there was a significantassociation between Zung anxiety scores with scores types <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> (p = 0. 012). Furthermore, there was a significantassociation between anxiety level with the type <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> (p = 0. 013).

40|$|Despite broad {{consensus}} {{about the effects}} <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> practices on child development, many questions about the construct parenting style remain unanswered. Particularly pressing issues are the variability in the effects <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> style {{as a function of}} the child's cultural background, the processes through which parenting style influences the child's development, and the operational-ization <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> style. Drawing on historical review, the authors present a model that integrates two traditions in socialization research, the study <b>of</b> specific <b>parenting</b> practices and the study <b>of</b> global <b>parent</b> characteristics.

5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, Charles Darwin {{formulated}} the scientific {{theory of evolution}} by natural selection, published in his book On the Origin of Species (1859). Evolution by natural selection is a process demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are produced than can possibly survive, along with three facts about populations: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness), and 3) traits can be passed {{from generation to generation}} (heritability of fitness). Thus, in successive generations members of a population are replaced by progeny <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> better adapted to survive and reproduce in the biophysical environment in which natural selection takes place.|$|E

Furthermore, infant temperament has also found to be influential on parenting, but has also generated mixed results concerning how negative reactivity influences parenting. In regard to both variables, research on fathers is severely lacking. This study examined the direct effects <b>of</b> <b>parent</b> personality on parenting through the BIS/BAS model. Additionally, the direct effects of infant temperament on parenting were assessed. The interaction between these two factors was also examined as a predictor of sensitivity. Using a portion of a sample from an ongoing longitudinal study (n = 41), findings supported differential determinants <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> for mothers and fathers, such that maternal sensitivity was influenced by infant temperament and paternal sensitivity was influenced by the interaction <b>of</b> <b>parent</b> personality and infant temperament...|$|R

5|$|Critics in the 1990s such as J. R. Harris, Steven Pinker and Jerome Kagan were {{generally}} {{concerned with the}} concept of infant determinism (nature versus nurture), stressing the effects of later experience on personality. Building on the work on temperament of Stella Chess, Kagan rejected almost every assumption on which attachment theory's cause was based. Kagan argued that heredity was far more important than the transient developmental effects of early environment. For example, a child with an inherently difficult temperament would not elicit sensitive behavioural responses from a caregiver. The debate spawned considerable research and analysis of data from the growing number of longitudinal studies. Subsequent research has not borne out Kagan's argument, possibly suggesting that it is the caregiver's behaviours that form the child's attachment style, although how this style is expressed may differ with the child's temperament. Harris and Pinker put forward the notion that the influence <b>of</b> <b>parents</b> had been much exaggerated, arguing that socialization took place primarily in peer groups. H.

The degree to which these studies meet previous recommendations for future research is explored, {{particularly with regard to}} the influence of context on intervention outcomes. Materials and Methods Seven studies are reviewed, which have been published in the peer-reviewed literature since 1994. Results Evidence from this review supports the use of individually administered home-based behavioural intervention for parents with intellectual disability. However, the effect <b>of</b> <b>parent</b> training interventions on child outcomes and the generalization <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> skills is rarely investigated. Contextual factors that may be associated with intervention success (or failure) are also neglected. Conclusions There is reasonable evidence of the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>parent</b> training for parents with intellectual disability. However, investigators have yet to determine the influence of immediate or more distal contextual factors on intervention outcomes. This presents a significant gap in the literature in contrast to other areas <b>of</b> <b>parenting</b> intervention research where the influence of family and the broader community context has been shown to influence the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>parent</b> training interventions...|$|R
