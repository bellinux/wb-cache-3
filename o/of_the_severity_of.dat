5|$|At least 44 {{people were}} killed in various {{incidents}} related to Typhoon Sarah in the Philippines while another three were reported missing. A total of 1,157 homes were destroyed and another 24,638 sustained damage, leaving approximately 200,000 people homeless. Damage from the storm was placed at $4.3million. In light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> damage caused by Sarah, a state of calamity was declared for northern provinces. Less than a week after the storm, additional rains in areas affected by Sarah triggered landslides that killed at least 16 people. Officials blamed the landslides on rocks loosened by the typhoon's rains.|$|E
5|$|Harrison {{discussed}} the song at length in a 1987 interview for Musician magazine, {{during which he}} recalls that his mother developed a brain tumour late in 1969 but then recovered for seven months. After hearing of the initial diagnosis in September 1969, Harrison cancelled a recording session with Apple Records artist Jackie Lomax to see her; author Peter Doggett comments that, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> this news, Harrison would later have no recollection of how he heard of John Lennon's decision to leave the Beatles, on 20 September.|$|E
5|$|Bianchi drove for ART in the {{subsequent}} GP2 Asia season and the 2010 GP2 season. He competed {{in three of the}} four rounds of the GP2 Asia championship. In the main series, Bianchi took two pole positions and a number of points positions before he was injured in a first-lap crash at the Hungaroring. In the feature race, he spun into the path of the field exiting the first corner, and was struck head-on by Ho-Pin Tung, sustaining a fractured second lumbar vertebra in the process. Bianchi was fourth in the drivers' championship {{at the time of his}} injury. Despite initial pessimistic assessments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> his injury, he recovered to take part in the next round of the championship.|$|E

5|$|During the match, she {{was knocked}} onto her right side, and {{her right arm}} became trapped {{underneath}} her wheelchair, causing a tendon in her elbow to rupture. Tracey Ferguson, the Canadian player who knocked her down tried to block the way for Australian officials to help her up. Carter lost considerable mobility in her right arm, and required an elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine getting treatment. Nine operations were required to treat the elbow. Because she had a pre-existing condition, the insurance company refused {{to pay for her}} treatment, although it paid her $7,500 in return for agreeing not to take legal action. Carter carried a lot of anger towards the Canadian in the first year following her accident. By 2004, she still could not fully flex her hand. Following her accident, she occasionally required the use of an electric wheelchair because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> her injury, and needed the assistance of the Council's Home Care to clean her home. Before 2000, she had mostly been coached by national team coach Peter Corr.|$|E
5|$|In Zoha Prison in Romania, {{there are}} {{interviews}} with traffickers serving prison sentences {{that the film}} suggested were too short in light <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> the crime of human trafficking. The typical sentence for this crime is six or seven years, while the sentence for trafficking in drugs is normally twenty years. Two Romanian traffickers, Traian and Ovidiu, attest to having starved, punched, and kicked the girls they trafficked. Ovidiu recounts a story, in an interview filmed in February 2007, about kidnapping a prostitute and selling her for sex when he was 14. He expresses no remorse for these actions. The sentences served by Traian and Ovidiu were short enough that, {{by the time the}} film was released, they were no longer in prison. Ana, a girl they trafficked, is also interviewed in the film, saying that she lost a tooth in one of her beatings. She describes being pregnant at the time, but not telling this to her captors because of fears for the unborn child's safety.|$|E
5|$|On Saturday night, Max Mayfield, {{director}} of the National Hurricane Center, did something he had done only once before.

Later, Mr. Mayfield would tell Brian Williams with NBC Nightly News {{that he went to}} bed that night believing he had done what he could. On Sunday, he made a video call to U.S. President George W.

5|$|The Public Theater {{struggled}} {{to raise the}} $5.5million budgeted for the Broadway transfer, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>severity</b> <b>of</b> the economic recession in late 2008, but it reached its goal by adding new producing partners. Director Diane Paulus helped keep costs low by using an inexpensive set. The show grossed a healthy $822,889 in its second week. On April 30, 2009 on the Late Show with David Letterman, the cast recreated a performance on the same stage at the Ed Sullivan Theater by the original tribe. The production won the Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical, the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival of a Musical and the Drama League Award for Distinguished Revival of a Musical. By August 2009, the revival had recouped its entire $5,760,000 investment, {{becoming one of the}} fastest-recouping musicals in Broadway history. Its cast album was nominated for the 2010 Grammy Award for Best Musical Show Album.|$|E
