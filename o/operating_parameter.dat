40|$|In present {{manufacturing}} environment, {{the manufacturing}} flexibility {{has become one}} of the strategic competitive tools. Flexibility refers to the availability of alternative resources. These resources may have varied parameters, particularly related to physical and operating system. These physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> of alternative resources may influence the system's performance with the changing levels of flexibility and operational control parameters such as scheduling rules. Is increase in a flexibility level provides desired improved performance output? If yes, than under what conditions of physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> and under which control strategy (CS) ? Is improved performance is present at all increasing levels of flexibility? Flexible manufacturing system (FMS) being consist of numerous physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> and complex in nature, the solution to these questions can provide an understanding of the productive levels of flexibility for a given physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> of an FMS. This paper establishes the need of modelling of the physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> of flexible manufacturing system along with flexibility and presents a simulation study under Taguchi's method analysis of these parameters. The paper contributes an approach to study the impact of variations in physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> of an FMS and to identify the level of these variations that do not restrict the advantages of flexibility. The results show that the expected benefits from increasing the levels of flexibility and a superior CS may not be achieved if the physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> of alternative machines have variations. Taguchi's method analysis indicates that relative percentage contribution of variations in physical and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> of alternative resources should be negligible or minimum in the performance of FMS. Their increasing relative contribution may restrict the advantages of flexibility. If these variations are higher than increase in flexibility level may be counter productive. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{abrasive}} {{water jet}} (AWJ) cutting method {{has been used}} widely for the cutting and processing of materials because of its cool, damage-free, and precise cutting technique. Nowadays, the use of AWJ cutting in the natural stone industry is increasing. However, the effectiveness of AWJ cutting of natural stones {{is dependent on the}} rock properties and machine <b>operating</b> <b>parameters.</b> In this study, injection-type AWJ cutting was applied to 42 different types of natural stones to investigate the effects of rock properties and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> on the cutting depth. Shore hardness, Bohme surface abrasion resistance and the density of the rocks were the most significant rock properties affecting the cutting depth. The working pump pressure and traverse velocity were the most significant <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> affecting cutting, as has been shown previously. The relationships between the rock properties or <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> and the cutting depth were evaluated using multiple linear and nonlinear regression analyses, and estimation models were developed. Some of the models included only rock properties under fixed operating conditions, and others included both rock properties and <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> to predict cutting depth. The models allow for the preselection of particular <b>operating</b> <b>parameters</b> for the cutting of specific rocks types. The prediction of cutting depth is a valuable tool for the controlled surface machining of rock materials...|$|R

50|$|Control {{grouping}} poses difficult problems, {{especially in}} systems where a given <b>operating</b> <b>parameter</b> {{may be affected}} by multiple control groups.

5000|$|A {{system can}} either be {{described}} as a MIMO system, having multiple inputs and outputs, therefore requiring more than one controller; or a SISO system, consisting of a single input and single output, hence having only a single controller. Depending on the set-up of the physical (or non-physical) system, adjusting the system's input variable (assuming it is SISO) will affect the <b>operating</b> <b>parameter,</b> otherwise known as the controlled output variable. Upon receiving the error signal that marks the disparity between the desired value (setpoint) and the actual output value, the controller will then attempt to regulate controlled output behaviour. The controller achieves this by either attenuating or amplifying the input signal to the plant so that the output is returned to the setpoint. For example, a simple feedback control system, such as the one shown on the right, will generate an error signal that's mathematically depicted as the difference between the setpoint value and the output value, r-y. [...] This signal describes the magnitude by which the output value deviates from the setpoint. The signal is subsequently sent to the controller C which then interprets and adjusts for the discrepancy. If the plant is a physical one, the inputs to the system are regulated by means of actuators.|$|E
