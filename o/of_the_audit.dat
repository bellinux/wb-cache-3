During 2000, Arthur Andersen earned $25 million in audit fees and $27 million in consulting fees (this amount accounted for roughly 27% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audit</b> fees of public clients for Arthur Andersen's Houston office). The auditor's methods were questioned as either being completed solely to receive its annual fees or for its lack of expertise in properly reviewing Enron's revenue recognition, special entities, derivatives, and other accounting practices.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) audited Chipotle's Minneapolis restaurants, {{and found}} that some {{employees}} had been hired using fraudulent documents. In December, Chipotle fired 450 employees from its Minneapolis restaurants as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audit,</b> resulting in protests by local groups. In February 2011, ICE expanded the audit to include 60 restaurants in Virginia and Washington, D.C. which resulted in 40 workers being fired. In April 2011, the criminal division of the Attorney General's office in Washington, D.C., joined the case, and ICE agents began interviewing employees at 20 to 25 restaurants in other locations, such as Los Angeles and Atlanta. In response to the government investigations, Chipotle hired former director of ICE Julie Myers Wood and high-profile attorneys Robert Luskin and Gregory B. Craig.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The present article {{presents}} the results on an empiric study an empiric study on <b>the</b> independence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> financial <b>audit</b> in Romania. <b>The</b> methodology <b>of</b> research is a quantitative one. The statistic population is formed from three groups namely the financial auditors, financial managers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audited</b> firms and <b>the</b> users <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audited</b> accounting information. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> questionnaire have been analysed by <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> Kruskal Wallis Test, which has shown that for every statement {{the differences between the}} three groups are significant. Next the results have been interpreted globally.

5|$|The Pipe rolls are {{the records}} of the audits of the sheriffs' accounts, usually {{conducted}} at Michaelmas by the Exchequer, or English treasury. Until the chancery records began in the reign of King John of England, they were the only continuous set of records kept by the English government. They are not a complete record of government and royal finances, however, as they do not record all sources of income, only the accounts of the sheriffs and a few other sources of income. Some of the payments that did not regularly fall under the Exchequer were occasionally recorded in a Pipe roll. Neither do the Pipe rolls record all payments made by the exchequer. They were not created as a budget, nor were they strictly speaking records of receipts, but rather they are records <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>audit</b> of the accounts rendered. Although the rolls use an accounting system, it is not one that would be familiar to modern accountants; for instance {{until the end of the}} 12th century, no record was made of the total amount taken in by the sheriff of each shire. In their early form, they record all debts owed to the Crown, whether from feudal dues or from other sources. Because many debts to the king were allowed to be paid off in installments, it is necessary to search more than one set of rolls for a complete history of a debt. If a debt was not paid off completely in one year, the remainder of the amount owed was transferred to the next year. They did not record the full amount of debts incurred in previous years, only what was paid that year and what was still owed. Besides the sheriffs, others who submitted accounts for the audit included some bailiffs of various honours, town officials, and the custodians of ecclesiastical and feudal estates.|$|E

Our paper reports on an empirical study of 17 auditors and 22 representatives of VfM client organisations.

Our results also indicate significant role conflicts in the VfM process. Three types of conflict could be identified: (a) conflict between the VfM auditors' roles and their own professional values and standards (person-role conflict); (b) conflict between the VfM auditors' capabilities and their role requirements (role overload), and (c) conflict between the auditors and the auditees (inter-sender conflict) ...|$|R

40|$|Digitalization is a {{fast paced}} {{phenomenon}} that is recognised to be <b>of</b> importance for <b>the</b> <b>auditing</b> profession’s future. This study has, through an innovative approach, gathered {{the ideas and}} perspectives on the perceived future role of digitalization in relation to <b>the</b> <b>auditing</b> profession. In {{order to ensure that}} these ideas and perspectives were to be practically relevant, 14 Swedish auditors were interviewed. This study was initiated through an evident need <b>of</b> research about <b>the</b> future role <b>of</b> digitalization, as this role is recognized as important but rather under-theorized according to both practitioners and academics.   In order to tackle the need for research within the relatively unexplored area of digitalization in relation to <b>the</b> <b>auditing</b> profession, a dialogue with practitioners led to <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following research question:    -How do auditors expect digitalization to shape <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditing</b> profession?   In order to accurately answer the constructed research question, three sub-questions were established:   - How do auditors perceive past and current changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditing</b> profession? - How do auditors perceive futures changes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditing</b> profession? - How do auditors perceive <b>the</b> future role <b>of</b> digitalization?   <b>The</b> underlying purpose <b>of</b> this study was to push for a unification between the academic and practice community. To achieve this, a follow-up sub-question was generated:   - How do auditors perceive <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> academic research to shape <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auditing</b> profession?   And inductive research approach was adopted for this study, in line with <b>the</b> epistemological standpoint <b>of</b> interpretivism and a constructionism ontological approach. Furthermore, this thesis was a conducted qualitative exploratory research that employed semi-structured interviews. <b>The</b> research strategy <b>of</b> this study was a combination of narrative inquiry with grounded theory in order to collect data and to generate theories for building knowledge.   The results from the interviews with the auditors generated findings that were used to answer our four sub-questions, and therefore subsequently our main research question. It was concluded that academic research was not directly used by practitioners, since it was not found usable from a practical perspective. Furthermore, it was concluded through applying change theories that digitalization is, by auditors, expected {{to play an important role}} in <b>the</b> future <b>of</b> their profession and a list of driving forces was established. Moreover, discussions on how <b>the</b> <b>auditing</b> profession and digitalization will interact in the future are disclosed in this study...|$|R
