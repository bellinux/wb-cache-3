5|$|Apo{{lipoprotein}} B, in its ApoB100 form, is {{the main}} apolipoprotein, or protein part of the lipoprotein particle. Its gene {{is located on the}} second chromosome (2p24-p23) and is between 21.08 and 21.12Mb long. FH is often associated with the mutation of R3500Q, which causes replacement of arginine by glutamine at position 3500. The mutation is located <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the protein that normally binds with the LDL receptor, and binding is reduced {{as a result of the}} mutation. Like LDLR, the number of abnormal copies determines the severity of the hypercholesterolemia.|$|E
5|$|Dunkeswell Abbey, a Cistercian monastery and {{offshoot}} of Forde Abbey, {{was founded in}} 1201 by William Briwere. The abbey was closed in 1539 and granted to Lord Russell. It was mostly demolished promptly, though a section remained in domestic use until the 19th century. In 1842, a parish church was built <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the site. Some surviving fragments of monastery include the partial end wall of the cellarers range and parts of a gatehouse. Some carved fragments survive within the Victorian era church.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} two years of the club's existence, the players {{organised}} matches among themselves at Snaresbrook near Epping Forest, probably <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Epping Forest between the Infant Orphan Asylum and Forest Place. Forest's first match against another club took place on 15 March 1862, and resulted in a victory over Crystal Palace (not the modern club of the same name). Both this match, and a return fixture between the two teams the following month, involved fifteen players on each team. At the time, the rules of association football had not been codified, and many variants existed, differing in the number of players per team, whether players were permitted to play the ball with their hands, or the method of scoring goals. In 1863 the Forest club was among the founder members of The Football Association (the FA) and adopted the rules set down by that body, although they continued to play occasional matches under other sets of rules against clubs not affiliated to the FA.|$|E

25|$|The {{central part}} of Raditladi is {{occupied}} by a large peak ring with a diameter of 125km. The ring is slightly offset from the geometrical center of the basin in the north-west direction. The floor of Raditladi is covered by two types of terrain: light smooths plains and dark hummocky plains. The former partially embay the hummocky plains and are probably volcanic in origin. The latter are present mainly <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the floor between the peak ring and crater rim; they interpreted to be the original crater floor material {{not covered by the}} light colored lavas of smooth plains. The hummocky plains are slightly bluer than smooth plains. The areas outside Raditladi are covered by the dark relatively blue impact ejecta. The peak ring massifs at some places expose a bright blue material identical to one on the floors of some bright Mercurian impact craters (Bright Crater Floor Deposits—BCFD).|$|E
25|$|A freeway {{along the}} I-80 {{corridor}} {{had been planned}} in 1936 and again in 1955 to provide relief along US 46 between the George Washington Bridge and the Delaware Water Gap. With {{the establishment of the}} Interstate Highway System, this planned freeway, which had been identified in some planning documents as the Bergen-Passaic Expressway, would be incorporated into I-80. The freeway was built across New Jersey in various stages from the 1960s to 1973. The westernmost four miles in New Jersey was originally a rerouting of US 611 when built; that route was later realigned back into Pennsylvania. In the 1990s, high-occupancy vehicle lanes had existed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> I-80 in Morris County but were opened to regular traffic due to underuse. The Delaware Water Gap Toll Bridge and its approach is planned to be widened from four to six lanes, with construction beginning in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Belém and Ajuda {{were the}} areas around Lisbon {{suffering}} the least destruction {{in the great}} Lisbon earthquake and the following tsunami on 1 November 1755.

King Joseph and his court moved to a complex of tents and barracks located <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the royal estates where the Ajuda National Palace would be built. This relocation by the King and his Prime Minister and Secretary of State, the Marquess of Pombal, attracted commerce and made the Belém-Ajuda {{the centre of the}} state bureaucracy during the third quarter of the 18th century. A military presence was also deemed important by the government: two regimental infantry barracks under the Count of Lippe, and a cavalry regiment under Mecklenburg were installed. These events consolidated the integration of Belém-Ajuda into the city of Lisbon.|$|E

25|$|The Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja {{mentions}} that Tomislav, whose rule was specified at 13 years, successfully fought many battles with the Hungarians. Since the Venetian chronicler Andrea Dandolo and a notary of King Béla III mention Hungarian victories against Croatia {{in the same}} period, both sides had occasional gains. Croatia did manage to maintain its northern borders, but also to expand <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the collapsed Pannonian Duchy, such as its former capital Sisak. The plains north of Sisak were difficult to defend {{in front of the}} Hungarian cavalry, while Sisak was well fortified since the times of Duke Ljudevit. The sparsely populated area between the Sava and Drava rivers was {{on the outskirts of the}} Hungarian state, as well as of the Duchy of Croatia that was centered on the coastal areas, so neither country had the power to strengthen its rule there after the dissolution of the Duchy of Pannonia.|$|E
25|$|In 1953, Governor John Nicoll {{decided that}} the {{building}} should be renovated {{for use as a}} legislative chamber. Renamed Assembly House, it was declared officially open on 9 July 1954, and the existing Legislative Council had its first meeting there on 20 July. It was then occupied from 1955 by the newly formed Legislative Assembly of Singapore, and was renamed Parliament House when Singapore became fully independent in 1965. In 1988 the building's debating chamber was extensively renovated {{to increase the number of}} seats in it to 90. However, as further extensions were not feasible without causing MPs discomfort and disrupting the chamber's configuration, plans were approved in 1992 for a new Parliament building to be constructed. The present Parliament House, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> High Street that was renamed Parliament Place, was completed in July 1999. It was officially inaugurated on 6 September 1999 with a special sitting that began in the Old Parliament House, continued with legislators walking from the old building to the new one, and concluded in the new Parliament House. Three items from the old chamber were brought over: the Mace of Parliament, the Table of the House, and the Speaker's chair. The building formerly occupied by Parliament reopened in March 2004 as a performance venue called the Arts House at the Old Parliament, and the street it is on was renamed Old Parliament Lane.|$|E
25|$|MD 192 {{from the}} 7th Street Pike (now Georgia Avenue) west to Seminary Road was paved as a macadam road by 1923. The macadam road was {{extended}} to Kensington by 1927. MD 192's original western terminus was at St. Paul Avenue, which was the original course of MD 193. The highway was extended west along Metropolitan Avenue and Plyers Mill RoadMD 193 (now MD 185) was relocated around the center of Kensington after its grade separation of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was built in 1936by 1950. MD 192 was extended east from MD 97 along Forest Glen Road to Sligo Creek starting in 1934. That same year, a separate segment was built <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Forest Glen Road then named Fairway Avenue from US 29 west to Dallas Avenue. The Fairway Avenue segment was designated MD 597 by 1939, but became part of MD 192 when the portion of Forest Glen Road between Sligo Creek and Dallas Avenue was brought into the state highway system by 1946. This middle segment between Sligo Creek Parkway and Dallas Avenue was transferred to Montgomery County by 1961. The eastern segment of MD 192, whose eastern end had been shorn off by the construction of US 29's interchange with I-495, {{was removed from the}} state highway system in 1977. The final eastern segment of MD 192 from MD 97 to Sligo Creek Parkway was transferred to county maintenance between 1989 and 1991.|$|E
