2500|$|By 27 December 2009, {{there were}} {{on-going}} or prepared dismantling of turbines1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10. [...] Only turbines 5 and 6 {{were to be}} repaired in situ. The <b>other</b> <b>turbines</b> were to be replaced, repaired in the factory and/or modernized.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} turbine was decommissioned in 2015 due to age, {{and replaced}} in 2016 {{with a larger}} version. The original turbine was a relatively small machine compared with <b>other</b> <b>turbines</b> [...] installed in New Zealand, such as those at Te Āpiti Wind Farm, with an installed capacity of 0.23 MW. The present turbine has a capacity of 0.9 MW, enough to power around 490 homes, with the power generated going into the local network for general distribution. The tower hub is 44m high and the blades are 20.8m long.|$|E
2500|$|Turbine2 {{was started}} on 16 August 2009 at 23:14 local time. At 23:44 it was running at {{a full load}} of 600MW. [...] During the night, its load varied between 10 and 610MW. At {{the moment of the}} accident, which was 8:13 local time (00:13 GMT), its load was 475MW and water {{consumption}} was [...] Vibration of the bearing was , which far exceeded the values of the <b>other</b> <b>turbines</b> by more than fourfold. The working life defined by the manufacturer for the turbines was specified as 30years. At the moment of the accident, the age of the turbine was 29years and 10months.|$|E
25|$|The {{offshore}} wind {{industry is not}} fully industrialized, as supply bottlenecks still exist as of 2017. Monopiles up to 11 m diameter at 2,000 tonnes can be made, but the largest so far are 1,300 tonnes which is below the 1,500 tonnes limit of some crane vessels. The <b>other</b> <b>turbine</b> components are much smaller.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{excellent}} behaviour with partial loads, the cross-flow turbine is well-suited to unattended electricity production. Its simple construction {{makes it}} easier to maintain than <b>other</b> <b>turbine</b> types; only two bearings must be maintained, and there are only three rotating elements. The mechanical system is simple, so repairs can be performed by local mechanics.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to <b>other</b> <b>turbine</b> designs, the {{relatively}} low specific speed of the Pelton wheel, implies that the geometry is inherently a [...] "low gear" [...] design. Thus it is most suitable to being fed by a hydro source with a low ratio of flow to pressure, (meaning relatively low flow and/or relatively high pressure).|$|R
2500|$|From January to March 2009, turbine2 was {{undergoing}} scheduled repairs and modernization. It {{was the first}} and only turbine in the station which was equipped with a new electro-hydraulic regulator of its rotational speed supplied by the Promavtomatika company. [...] During the course of the repair, the turbine blades were welded, because after a long period of operation, cracks and cavities had once again appeared. The turbine runner was not properly rebalanced after these repairs, following which turbine2 had increased vibrations, ca [...] for the main bearing during the full load of the turbine. While this did not exceed specifications, the increased vibrations were unacceptable for long term use. The elevated vibration levels compared to <b>other</b> <b>turbines</b> were apparent for turbine 2 before the repair as well. The vibrations exceeded the allowed specification in the beginning of July and continued to increase with accelerated speed.|$|E
2500|$|Separately in May 2005 the Canadian company MagEnergy {{signed an}} {{agreement}} with SNEL to rehabilitate some of Inga II’s turbines, with a completion goal of 2009. [...] Actual work to rehabilitate Inga II finally began April 27, 2006, just under a year after the initial agreement with MagEnergy was signed. [...] This first phase, which involved fixing a single 168 MW turbine and other emergency repair work, was reported 90% complete in April 2009, and the second phase (four <b>other</b> <b>turbines)</b> was estimated to take five additional years. [...] However, there is doubt over whether the government accepts the validity of the contract, and in the meantime the Canadian company First Quantum was hired to rehabilitate two separate Inga II turbines. [...] To carry out the repairs, the SNEL has received funding from the Regional and Domestic Power Markets Development Project, which is itself supported by the World Bank, African Development Bank, and European Investment Bank.|$|E
2500|$|According to the {{newspaper}} Izvestia, the increased vibration of turbine2 was going on for some 10years and was well-known to the plant personnel. [...] According to {{the former director of}} Irkutskenergo, Viktor Bobrovski, the accident could have been caused by an incorrect start-up process of the turbine which resulted in a hydraulic pressure surge, or excess load of the turbine caused by peak consumption of electricity. According to Bobrovski, it is common practice in the region to compensate for a peak load by overloading hydroelectric power plants, and the energy system of the region is near collapse, as the main goal of its owners is to take out as much profit as possible, typically by cutting down on maintenance, investment, safety, and educational costs. [...] Since the load for <b>other</b> <b>turbines</b> ceased {{after the collapse of the}} turbine2, they probably started to spin without load at increasing speed until they failed. He said that the former director of Sayano–Shushenskaya hydroelectric power station, Valentin Bryzgalov, had alerted that it is dangerous to operate the plant at its maximum loads when the turbines are starting to vibrate in the axial direction. He said that the accident probably would not have had such catastrophic results if the safety systems had worked and the safety rules had been followed.|$|E

5000|$|On 19 March 2010 a blade {{snapped off}} a turbine {{which led to}} Whitelee wind farm being {{temporarily}} shut down while safety checks were completed on all <b>other</b> <b>turbines</b> on the site.|$|E
50|$|By 27 December 2009, {{there were}} {{on-going}} or prepared dismantling of turbines 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, and 10. Only turbines 5 and 6 {{were to be}} repaired in situ. The <b>other</b> <b>turbines</b> were to be replaced, repaired in the factory and/or modernized.|$|E
50|$|Construction of the {{facility}} began in 2012, consisting of five 135 metre tall turbines manufactured by Enercon. Three <b>other</b> <b>turbines</b> were constructed shortly thereafter. While construction activity has provided jobs to the area, {{the facility}} has been controversial. Some local residents have formed protest organizations, arguing that the turbines have negatively affected the bucolic nature of the Soonwald and the Hunsrück.|$|E
50|$|Another {{advantage}} {{is that it can}} often clean itself. As the water leaves the runner, leaves, grass etc. will not remain in the runner, preventing losses. Therefore, although the turbine's efficiency is somewhat lower, it is more reliable than other types. No runner cleaning is normally necessary, e.g. by flow inversion or variations of the speed. <b>Other</b> <b>turbine</b> types are clogged more easily, and consequently face power losses despite higher nominal efficiencies.|$|R
5000|$|Particularly {{with small}} run-of-the-river plants, the flat {{efficiency}} curve yields better annual performance than <b>other</b> <b>turbine</b> systems, as small rivers' water is usually lower in some months. The efficiency of a turbine determines whether electricity is produced during the periods when rivers have low flows. If the turbines used have high peak efficiencies, but behave poorly at partial load, less annual performance is obtained than with turbines {{that have a}} flat efficiency curve.|$|R

50|$|Karapiro is a {{baseload}} power station, {{as it is}} required to maintain water flow in the lower Waikato River even during low inflows to the catchment and during low electricity demand. Only two turbines are required to keep the river flow at a reasonable level, with the third turbine being available for peak generation and maintenance {{on one of the}} <b>other</b> <b>turbines.</b>|$|E
50|$|Like its RB211 predecessor, the Trent uses a three-spool design {{rather than}} the more common two-spool configuration. Although more complex, the engine is shorter and more rigid, and suffers less {{performance}} degradation in service than an equivalent twin-spool. The advantage three spools gives is that the front-most fan (driven by the third, rearmost turbine) can be tuned to rotate at its optimal (fairly low) speed; the two compressors are driven by the two <b>other</b> <b>turbines</b> via their spools. The three spools are concentric.|$|E

50|$|Standard modern {{turbines}} all furl {{the blades}} in high winds. Since furling requires acting against the torque on the blade, it requires {{some form of}} pitch angle control, which is achieved with a slewing drive. This drive precisely angles the blade while withstanding high torque loads. In addition, many turbines use hydraulic systems. These systems are usually spring-loaded, so that if hydraulic power fails, the blades automatically furl. <b>Other</b> <b>turbines</b> use an electric servomotor for every rotor blade. They have a small battery-reserve {{in case of an}} electric-grid breakdown. Small wind turbines (under 50 kW) with variable-pitching generally use systems operated by centrifugal force, either by flyweights or geometric design, and employ no electric or hydraulic controls.|$|E
