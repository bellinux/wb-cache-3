This excessive rainfall can be exacerbated by an El Nino year, which 2015 was.|$|E

5|$|Advertising {{alcohol on}} {{television}} and in the press was outlawed under president Marc Ravalomanana. In order to maximize brand recognition of THB, the company altered the label for its Fresh shandy, which was exempt from this ban due to its low alcohol content, to match the THB Pilsener design but using a green background instead of the pilsener's red. The pilsener is advertised in a variety of non-traditional ways, such as through celebrity promotion in music videos and music and sporting event sponsorship. THB is considered by the public as a promoter of Malagasy culture and identity, particularly through its sponsorship <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>annual</b> THB Tour traveling music festival and the THB fête de la bière (beer festival). Three Horses Beer sponsors the THB Champions League, the national football championship.

5|$|Flooding was {{considered}} worst in Puebla, {{and were the}} worst floods in about 400years, according to newspaper reports. A total of 21,342people evacuated their houses to 116shelters, mostly in the state's northern portion. The floods affected 16,511houses and 199schools. In Teziutlán, {{with a population of}} about 50,000, it is estimated the city received nearly half <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>annual</b> rainfall in about three days. Nine entire communities became isolated due to the floods, and the small village of Patla sustained heavy damage after the Necaxa River changed its course closer to the town. Widespread landslides occurred, including over 80 in Teziutlán alone; one mudslide there destroyed 80houses. Some of the landslides occurred along rivers and produced new lakes, but 85% of these broke within the first year. Population growth, primarily in Teziutlán and Zaragoza, occurred in landslide-prone areas along mountains. Along Sierra Norte de Puebla, deforestation contributed to additional landslides. A landslide covered the Zacatepec River near Zempoala, creating a natural dam and a small lake. Mudslides buried at least 16people at a school in Pantepec, and a deforested hill caused a landslide in the Indigenous village of Acalama, which covered up to 170people. Most had fled to a church that was also covered, and it is estimated that only 30people survived in the village. Statewide, 263people were killed, including 107 in Teziutlán who were buried by mudslides, becoming the worst disaster {{in the history of the}} town. In the village of Tetela de Ocampo, 31people died. In Puebla, 30,000people were injured, and 81 municipalities sustained damage, with statewide damage estimated at about $240million (2.1billion pesos).|$|E
