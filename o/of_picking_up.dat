5|$|The Jain texts further {{illustrate}} {{the effects of}} leśyās on the mental dispositions of a soul, using {{an example of the}} reactions of six travellers on seeing a fruit-bearing tree. They see a tree laden with fruit and begin to think of getting those fruits: one of them suggests uprooting the entire tree and eating the fruit; the second one suggests cutting the trunk of the tree; the third one suggests simply cutting the branches; the fourth one suggests cutting the twigs and sparing the branches and the tree; the fifth one suggests plucking only the fruits; the sixth one suggests picking up only the fruits that have fallen down. The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the person with the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the person with the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks <b>of</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E

30|$|The {{observations}} made by Sakigake {{revealed the}} asymmetric {{distribution of the}} interaction region of Halley’s comet, {{and the center of}} the interaction region was shifted toward the post-encounter side on the spacecraft trajectory. Oya (1993) proposed the model that this asymmetric distribution is explained by the field aligned motion <b>of</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> ions. Based on this model, we examined spatial and time scale of field aligned motion of cometary ions in the ion pick-up process by using numerical experiments and the shift of the interaction region is estimated. In the simulation results, it was shown that the braking process of the field aligned motion <b>of</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> ions are understood by the wave particle interaction through the excitation of the MHD wave and pitch angle scattering caused by the turbulent magnetic field, and spatial scale of field aligned motion of cometary ion was estimated to 1.5 × 106 km. This result suggests that observed asymmetrical distribution of the interaction region of the comet is formed by the motion <b>of</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> ions toward the field aligned direction until their merging into the solar wind, as it was proposed by Oya (1993).|$|R

25|$|There were {{optional}} {{systems to}} dial {{the phone or}} pick it up, but these were generally implemented as separate devices also intended to be used {{on one end of}} the connection or the other.

With respect to the Women's component, with Canada being awarded the 2006 Women's World Cup of Rugby, to be played in Edmonton and the Ottawa/Montreal region, it was felt that for 2005 and 2006 the Women's component should be removed, with the Women playing in the Canada Cup of Women's Rugby in Ottawa/Montreal in July 2005 and the Women's World Cup itself in September 2006 in Edmonton and Ottawa/Montreal.|$|E

25|$|To {{explore a}} male {{strategic}} point of view, proponents of FCC make a simple model of alternative strategies. Female A uses cosmetics {{as part of}} her ritual coalition whenever one of them menstruates; Female B and all her female neighbors use no cosmetics. Male A is prepared to work/invest to gain access; Male B tries a philanderer strategy, moving to the next cycling fertile female, neglecting the previous partner once she is pregnant. Very quickly, Male A will end up working/doing bride-service for Female A's coalition, since he has no competition from Male B. Male A gains regular fitness as a result. Male B will pair up with Female B, but is then liable to abandon her if he finds a new cycling female. She then has little support during pregnancy/breastfeeding. The question will be whether Male B gains sufficient fitness via a roving strategy <b>of</b> <b>picking</b> <b>up</b> cycling, non-cosmetic females. If Male A is not able to compete with Male B in terms of dominance, he is better off choosing the cosmetic females. Because Female B and her non-cosmetic female neighbors get the attentions, but no reliable investment, from Male B, they discourage any investment from the likes of Male A. Once costs of encephalization begin to bite and cooperative strategies are needed to support offspring, how many females will be choosing philanderers in preference to investors? Those females {{are not likely to be}} ancestors of large-brained hominins like ourselves or the Neanderthals.|$|E
