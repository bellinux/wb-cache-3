5|$|When Rasputin {{was murdered}} in December 1916, Victoria and Kirill signed a letter along with <b>other</b> <b>relatives</b> asking the Tsar to show {{leniency}} to Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, one of those implicated in the murder. The Tsar denied their request. Twice during the war Victoria visited Romania, where her sister Marie was now queen, volunteering aid for war victims. Victoria returned to Saint Petersburg in February 1917. Kirill had been appointed commander of the Naval Guards, quartered in Saint Petersburg, {{so he could be}} with his family for some time. Although publicly loyal to the Tsar, Victoria and Kirill began to meet in private with <b>other</b> <b>relatives</b> to discuss the best way to save the monarchy.|$|E

5|$|Fields' {{political}} enemies {{charged him with}} corruption and chastised him for issuing too many pardons. He also drew criticism for appointing his eldest son as state examiner, political supporter James Brown as tax commissioner, and <b>other</b> <b>relatives</b> and political supporters to low-ranking positions in the state government. Although the party strongly supported Alben Barkley's senatorial bid in 1926, Fields and his allies refused to support 1927 gubernatorial candidate J. C. W. Beckham, and the governorship went to Republican Flem D. Sampson.|$|E
5|$|Following this defeat, Ptolemy {{retreated to}} Egypt, and Menelaus {{was forced to}} {{surrender}} Salamis and its garrison, further increasing Demetrius' strength. Demetrius then moved {{to take over the}} rest of Cyprus, taking over the garrisons, some 16,000 infantry and 800 cavalry, into his own army as well. Menelaus and <b>other</b> <b>relatives</b> and friends of Ptolemy, however, who had been captured, were soon sent back to Egypt with their personal possessions.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas II and Alexandra Fyodorovna (Alix of Hesse) were exhumed {{from their}} tombs in September 2015 to confirm links to <b>other</b> <b>relatives.</b> This test was done so the Church and {{a branch of}} the Romanov line could set aside their doubts. The burial of what now are {{considered}} to be Maria's and Alexei's remains, to be with those of the family, was planned for 2015 but has been delayed mainly due to the insistence of the Russian Orthodox Church on more DNA-testing.|$|E

5|$|Roger le Poer was {{a medieval}} Lord Chancellor from 1135 until 1139 for King Stephen of England. The {{son of a}} {{powerful}} bishop, Roger owed his position to his family connections. He lost his office when his father and <b>other</b> <b>relatives</b> lost power. Arrested along with his father, Roger was used to secure the surrender of a castle held by his mother and then disappeared from history.|$|E
5|$|The named {{plaintiff}} in the case, Deborah Peterson, is {{the sister of}} {{a victim of the}} Beirut barracks bombings; joined by victims and <b>other</b> <b>relatives</b> of victims, she had won a default judgment in 2003 against Iran for its role in the bombings. Because of the large number of plaintiffs in the case—almost 1,000—the judge appointed special masters to determine each plaintiff's right to collect damages and appropriate amount of damages; in 2007, the judge entered a default judgment against Iran for $2,656,944,877 in damages.|$|E
5|$|Alexander was {{a nephew}} of Roger, Bishop of Salisbury, {{probably}} {{the son of}} Roger's brother Humphrey. His mother's name, Ada, is known from the Lincoln Cathedral libri memoriales, or obituary books. Alexander's brother David was archdeacon of Buckingham in the diocese of Lincoln. <b>Other</b> <b>relatives</b> included Nigel, another nephew of Roger's; and Adelelm, later Treasurer of England, who was recorded as Roger's nephew but perhaps was his son. It is possible, although unproven, that Nigel was really Alexander's brother rather than his cousin. Roger's son Roger le Poer, who later became Chancellor of England, was also a cousin. Alexander's cousin Nigel had a son, Richard FitzNeal, who later became Treasurer of England and Bishop of London. Alexander also had a nephew William, who became an archdeacon, and a great-nephew named Robert de Alvers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In the paper, we {{developed}} an improved approach for the imperialist competitive algorithm {{to help the}} original algorithm escape from local optimal area and obtain better performance. The Nelder-Meand simplex method is also introduced to execute alternately with the original procedures of the algorithm. The proposed approach is tested on twelve widely-used benchmark functions to check its validity. Compared with <b>other</b> <b>relative</b> studies, the proposed approach shows faster convergence rate, better search ability, and better stability than the original algorithm and <b>other</b> <b>relative</b> methods...|$|R
5|$|As Zahir {{consolidated}} {{his power}} and reduced external threats to his rule in the 1760s, his sons aspired for more influence and ultimately fought against their father and each other {{in order to secure}} their place as Zahir's successor. Besides support from elements of the Zaydani clan, Zahir's sons maintained their own power bases, largely derived from their mothers' clans, and also made their own alliances with other powerful actors in the region. Zahir was victorious in the many conflicts he had with his sons, but their frequent dissent weakened his rule and played a contributory role to his downfall in 1775. Prior to his sons' individual rebellions, Zahir had eliminated <b>other</b> <b>relatives</b> who challenged his power.|$|E
5|$|Attachment {{theory has}} {{implications}} in residence and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or <b>other</b> <b>relatives.</b> Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E
5|$|Coming from an oral tradition, {{the written}} word was nonexistent until the missionary arrival. Kanak {{knowledge}} was passed orally {{in the form of}} poems, legends, and stories. Children's oral history is provided by parents and <b>other</b> <b>relatives</b> who also use tickling and onomatopoeic noise to hold the child's attention. Of the Kanak authors, some of the notable ones are Jean-Marie Tjibaou who wrote La Présence Kanak; Susanna Ounei-Small, a Kanak author from Ouvéa who wrote about the Matignon Accords; and Kaloombat Tein, author of Hwanfalik – Sayings from the Hienghene Valley which provides insight into Hienghène legends and is written in Hienghène, with English language translation.|$|E

5|$|During PedroII's {{minority}} {{the governing}} regency faced countless rebellions throughout the country. Again breaking {{with his father}} and <b>other</b> <b>relatives</b> sympathetic to the rebels, from 1839 to 1845 Caxias commanded loyalist forces suppressing such uprisings as the Balaiada, the Liberal rebellions of 1842 and the Ragamuffin War. In 1851, under his command, the Brazilian army prevailed against the Argentine Confederation in the Platine War; a decade later Caxias, as army marshal (the army's highest rank), led Brazilian forces to victory in the Paraguayan War. As a reward he was raised to the titled nobility, becoming successively a baron, count, and marquis, finally becoming the only person created duke during PedroII's 58-year reign.|$|E
5|$|Elagabalus {{was born}} {{around the year}} 203 to Sextus Varius Marcellus and Julia Soaemias Bassiana. His father was {{initially}} {{a member of the}} Equites class, but was later elevated to the rank of senator. His grandmother, Julia Maesa, was the widow of the consul Julius Avitus, the sister of Julia Domna, and the sister-in-law of the emperor Septimius Severus. He had at least one sibling: an unnamed elder brother. His mother, Julia Soaemias, was a cousin of the Roman emperor Caracalla. His <b>other</b> <b>relatives</b> included his aunt Julia Avita Mamaea and uncle Marcus Julius Gessius Marcianus and among their children, their son Severus Alexander. Elagabalus's family held hereditary rights to the priesthood of the sun god Elagabal, of whom Elagabalus was the high priest at Emesa (modern Homs) in Roman Syria.|$|E
5|$|Foliot {{sent his}} nephew Richard Foliot and another clerk of his {{household}} to Bologna to study {{law in the}} 1160s, exemplifying the growing emphasis laid on Roman law among his countrymen. Another nephew was Ralph Foliot, Archdeacon of Hereford and a royal justice {{during the reign of}} Richard I. During his time at both dioceses, he did much to promote his relatives, and all of the archdeacons he appointed while at London were either nephews or <b>other</b> <b>relatives.</b> A member of his household at Hereford was the scholar Roger of Hereford, who dedicated his computus, or treatise on calculating dates, to Foliot. Another work, the Ysagoge in Theologiam, was dedicated to him by a writer named Odo while Foliot was still a prior in France.|$|E

5|$|In 1844, Breckinridge's wife Ann died. Lingering {{sadness and}} {{memories}} of his and Ann's life in Baltimore may have led {{him to leave the}} city and the pastorate he had held for twelve years. He was offered pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Lexington, Kentucky, but instead, accepted the presidency of Jefferson College in Pennsylvania in 1845 against the advice of his brothers John and William. A rift between Breckinridge and his brother Cabell's widow and <b>other</b> <b>relatives</b> may help account for this surprising decision. He did not feel he could yet return to his home state.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} for certain about Caffo; his dates of birth and death are not given in the sources. He {{is said to have}} been one of the sons of St Caw, a king in {{northern}} Britain who lost his lands and sought safety with his family in Anglesey; the ruler Maelgwn Gwynedd gave him land in the north-east of the island, in the district known as Twrcelyn. <b>Other</b> <b>relatives</b> of Caffo included his uncles St Iestyn and St Cyngar (brothers of Caw), his sister St Cwyllog and various brothers including St Gildas (although the number of his siblings varies from 10 to 21 in different manuscripts).|$|E
5|$|Montgomery's troops liberated Tailly, {{allowing}} Leclerc {{to return}} home to see Thérèse and the children again on 6 September 1944. His oldest sons, Henri and Hubert, now 18 and 17 years old respectively, lied about their ages to volunteer for service with 2e DB. Henri went on to serve with the RMT, while Hubert became a Sherman tank gunner with the 12e RCA. <b>Other</b> <b>relatives</b> also served with the division, including two nephews. The fighting in Paris cost 2e DB 97 killed and 238 wounded; nearly twice that number {{were lost in the}} fighting in surrounding areas. These were replaced by men and women who, like Leclerc's sons, offered themselves at a recruitment office the 2e DB established near the Bois de Boulogne.|$|E
