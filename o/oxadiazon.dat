The major lipid peroxidation and proline accumulation was observed for the herbicide oxyfluorfen. The oxyfluorfen and <b>oxadiazon</b> herbicides also resulted in increased activity of superoxide dismutase, compared to control. When evaluated ascorbate peroxidase activity, there was a higher enzyme activity in plants treated with <b>oxadiazon</b> and pendimethalin. Even selective herbicides registered for weed control in rice crops cause phytotoxicity, reduce height and alter the metabolism of plants, generating reactive oxygen species, which activate enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense systems and result in the degradation of photosynthetic pigments and in reduced protein content...|$|E

MH 383, a semi-spreading Virginia type, was the highest yielding cultivar and maintained its better yield {{in the presence of}} weeds and with the partially effective weed control provided by <b>oxadiazon.</b> The superiority of MH 383 was due to the rapid expansion of phenophase and thus suppression of weed growth. Monocotyledonous weeds were dominant over dicotyledonous ones, and B. eruciformis constituted about 66 % of the monocotyledonous weeds. Brachiaria eruciformis, Rhynochosia memnonia, Ipomea cordofana and Sonchus cornutus were the most troublesome weeds as they emerged simultaneously with the crop in high densities and continued to compete with it till harvest.

As mudas com 20 cm de altura, produzidas em tubetes, foram transplantadas num espaçamento de 2, 0 m x 2, 0 m, em parcelas de quatro fileiras com 10, 0 m de comprimento. Os tratamentos utilizados foram oxadiazil (600; 800 e 1000 g ha- 1), <b>oxadiazon</b> (1140; 1520 e 1900 g ha- 1), {{oxyfluorfen}} (720 g ha- 1), imazapyr (250 g ha- 1) e testemunhas (capinada e sem capina), dispostos em blocos ao acaso, com quatro repetições. Os herbicidas foram aplicados sete dias após o transplante, usando-se pulverizador costal, pressurizado com CO 2, calibrado para 200 L ha- 1 de calda. As principais plantas daninhas com maior infestação foram: Brachiaria plantaginea e Ipomoea grandifolia e com menor infestação: Galinsoga parviflora e Bidens pilosa. O oxadiazil apresentou excelente controle de B. plantaginea, I. grandifolia e G. parviflora, não sendo eficiente para controle de B. pilosa, embora proporcionasse controle superior ao observado pelo <b>oxadiazon.</b> O <b>oxadiazon</b> foi eficiente até 45 dias após o tratamento para B. plantaginea, G. parviflora e até 90 dias para I. grandifolia.

All herbicides provided 100 % control of Echinochloa colona, Echinochloa crus-galli, Leptochloa chinensis, Cyperus iria, and Amaranthus spinosus. Murdannia nudiflora was 100 % controlled by <b>oxadiazon</b> and pretilachlor with safener, but poorly controlled (22 - 75 %) by pendimethalin. Pendimethalin at 2 kg ai ha was more effective than at 1 kg ai ha in reducing the biomass of the stem, leaf, and root of M. nudiflora irrespective of timing of soil saturation. Rice plant height {{was reduced to a}} maximum (77 - 96 %) by pendimethalin at 2. 0 kg ai ha followed by <b>oxadiazon</b> at 1. 0 kg ai ha (38 - 70 %) compared to the non-treated control. In contrast, the tallest rice plants were observed in the non-treated control and those treated with pretilachlor with safener which had 80 - 100 % rice plant survival. The lowest rice plant survival of 0, 6, 7, and 16 % was found in the soil applied with pendimethalin at 2 kg ai ha and saturated at 1, 3, 5, and 7 DAS, respectively, which was followed by <b>oxadiazon</b> at 1 kg ai ha. All herbicides except pretilachlor with safener reduced SPAD values with early soil saturation, which improved with delay in soil saturation timing. Pendimethalin at 2 kg ai ha reduced the SPAD values of rice plants by 100 - 164 % relative to the non-treated control and produced the highest phytotoxicity symptoms. Pendimethalin also reduced rice shoot biomass more than <b>oxadiazon,</b> which was compounded by early soil saturation after herbicide application. Pretilachlor with safener was the only herbicide that exhibited low phytotoxic symptoms on rice plants and did not reduce leaf, stem, root, and shoot biomass of rice. Percent reduction in rice leaf, stem, root, and shoot biomass by the different herbicides was in the order of pendimethalin 2 > <b>oxadiazon</b> 1 > pendimethalin 1 > <b>oxadiazon</b> 0. 5 > pretilachlor with safener 0. 6 kg ai ha. Each herbicide treatment reduced rice growth parameters as soil saturation was delayed in the order of 1 DAS > 3 DAS > 5 DAS > 7 DAS.

The following herbicides were found to have potential for selectivity of S. secundatum: ALS-inhibitors chlorimuron-ethyl, ethoxysulfuron, halosulfuron, iodosulfuron-methyl and metsulfuron-methyl, mimicking of auxin 2. 4 -D, the inhibitors of the atrazine and bentazon photosystem II and the inhibitors Protox fomesafem, lactofen and <b>oxadiazon.</b> For turfgrass Z. japonica, the following herbicides showed potential for selectivity: the ALS-inhibitors chlorimuron-ethyl, ethoxysulfuron, halosulfuron, metsulfuron-methyl and nicosulfuron, mimicking of auxin 2. 4 -D and quinclorac, the inhibitors of the atrazine and bentazon photosystem II and the inhibitors Protox fomesafen, lactofen and <b>oxadiazon...</b>|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{nitric oxide}} acts on the {{antioxidant}} system {{of plants and}} can discontinue the damage of herbicides elicitors of oxidative stress that cause the disruption of membranes and leakage of cellular contents. In order to evaluate the protective effect of nitric oxide in electrolytes leakage, leaf segments of the Puita INTA CL rice cultivar were incubated with 0, 5, 50, 500 and 5, 000 &# 956;M clomazone (360 g a. i. L- 1), <b>oxadiazon</b> (250 g a. i. L- 1), oxyfluorfen (240 g a. i. L- 1) and the formulated mixture of paraquat (200 g a. i. L- 1) + diuron (100 g a. i. L- 1) to obtain the maximum potential conductivity of 50 % (MPC 50). Subsequently, leaf segments were pre-treated with 0, 200 and 2, 000 &# 956;M of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) for four hours and further incubated for 48 hours with 0, 0. 5, 1, 2 and 4 times the concentration of the herbicide that caused the CMP 50, and the protective effect was reassessed {{in the presence of}} nitric oxide scavenger, cPTIO. The MPC 50 was caused by exposure to 188. 9, 273. 4, 410. 2 + 205. 1 and 917. 0 &# 956;M of <b>Oxadiazon,</b> Oxyfluorfen, Paraquat + Diuron and Clomazone. Pretreatment with 200 &# 956;M of SNP reduced electrolyte leakage in leaf segments exposed to 2 and 4 times the MPC 50 to <b>oxadiazon</b> and paraquat + diuron, while 2, 000 &# 956;M reduced the damage caused by oxyfluorfen, at the same concentrations. Also, 200 and 2, 000 &# 956;M of SNP were efficient for clomazone, and the protection was confirmed by cPTIO in all cases...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, an {{environmentally}} friendly sample pre-treatment method, Ultrasound Assisted Surfactant Enhanced Emulsification Microextraction (UASEME) followed with spectrofluorimetry was performed for determination of <b>oxadiazon</b> residues in water samples. After {{the determination of}} the most suitable extraction solvent and its volume, other parameters such as type and concentration of surfactant, pH, extraction time and ionic strength were optimized. Under the best conditions for extraction recovery, 50 µL of chlorobenzene was chosen as extraction solvent and Tween 20 in concentration of 0. 06 mmol/L as emulsifier and 2 min was the required time for quantitative analysis, without ionic strength and pH adjustment. Limit of detection and relative standard deviation were calculated as 0. 05 µg/L and 3. 2 % respectively. The procedure was applied successfully for assessing matrix effect in real water samples with relative recovery 96 - 104 % with the precision in the range of 2. 9 - 3. 4 %. The results demonstrate that UASEME procedure as reported is reliable, rapid and easy to use for analysis of <b>oxadiazon</b> in water samples...|$|E
40|$|Five preemergent {{herbicides}} {{were evaluated}} {{for control of}} prostrate spurge (Euphorbia supina Raf.) in seven container-grown arid landscape ornamentals at the following rates in kilograms active ingredient per hectare: oxyfluorfen, 0. 6, 1. 1 and 2. 0; oryzalin, 3. 0, 6. 0 and 12. 0; Dacthal, 22. 4, 44. 8 and 89. 7; norea, 1. 2, 2. 2 and 4. 5; and axadiazon, 2. 2, 4. 5 and 9. 0, respectively. Prostrate spurge reaches its peak in summer. During the first test, February 5 - May 20, 1981, or 104 days, all herbicides provided satisfactory to complete control at all rates, except norea at 1. 2 and 2. 2 and <b>oxadiazon</b> at 2. 2 were ineffective in one test species. During the second test, May 21 - August 17, 1981 or 88 days, oryzalin gave the best overall control; oxyfluorfen provided effective control only at 2. 2; <b>oxadiazon</b> produced erratic results; and norea and Dacthal became ineffective at all rates after 23 days.

40|$|Controlled-release {{herbicide}} formulations {{have significant}} role in slow release of herbicides under laboratory and field conditions. In the present study kaolin, clay and saw dust were used to sorb the herbicide butachlor to test the slow release formulations of herbicides and their kinetic retention behavior in water. Release of different formulations of butachlor and <b>oxadiazon</b> were also studied. Desorption of <b>oxadiazon</b> formulations OA 1 showed higher release (93. 98 ± 0. 34 %) than OA 2 (43. 73 ± 0. 45 %), butachlor formulations BH 1 exhibited higher release (99. 29 ± 0. 33 %) than BH 2 (59. 45 ± 0. 30 %) on 28 th day. It was experimentally confirmed that clay and saw dust as a coating material have high adsorption rate (77. 2 %), found to increase the holding capacity of butachlor rather than kaolin and the release was very slow which may avoid herbicide loss by environmental degradation. Organoclays and saw dust may find application as better sorbents of herbicides than kaolin {{and this will be}} a promising formulation in the environmental and economic point of view...|$|E
40|$|Effect of {{different}} concentrations of three pre-emergence herbicides namely, pendimethalin (N-(1 -ethylopropyl) 2, 6 -dinitro- 3 - 4 -xylidine), trifluralin (2, 6 -dinitro-N-N-dipropyl- 4 -trifluoromethylaniline) and <b>oxadiazon</b> (3 -(2 - 4 dichloro- 5 isopropoxy Phenyl) - 5 -t-butyl - 3, 4 oxadizaolin 2 -one) on nodulation, nitrogen fixation, morphological characters {{and some other}} parameters have been investigated in groundnut (Arachis hypogaea), L. cv Banki. Pendimethalin @ 0. 74, 1. 49, 2. 23, trifluralin @ 0. 37, 0. 75, 1. 20 and oxadizon @ 0. 30, 0. 60, and 0. 90 kg ha - 1 was incorporated in soil before sowing. Data were recorded 40, 70 and 90 days after germination. Recommended doses of these herbicides in general had no significant effect on different parameters under investigation. Higher doses of these herbicides adversely affected the nodulation and the fresh and dry weights of nodules. However higher concentration of <b>oxadiazon</b> resulted in increased N. accumulation in shoots of groundnut plants. It was concluded that the herbicides under investigation {{did not affect the}} groundnut plants adversely if used at recommended levels...|$|E
40|$|Valerian (Valeriana officinalis L.) is a {{medicinal}} plant, but its cultivation {{is restricted}} by weed competition. Therefore, three rates (0. 75 X, 1 X, and 1. 25 X, where X {{is equal to}} the recommended dose of haloxyfop-R (methyl ester), sethoxydim, oxadiargyl, bentazon, <b>oxadiazon,</b> and oxyfluorfen) were applied at the 3 - 4 leaf stages to valerian plants. This application was done to select the herbicide type and rate for post-controlling broadleaf and grasses weeds in this species. Herbicide injury, Soil-Plant Analyses Development (SPAD) reading, number of leaves per plant, stem diameter, and fresh and dry weights were determined 10, 20, and 30 days after herbicide application. Oxyfluorfen application caused the most herbicide injury followed by bentazon. Injury increased as the rate and the days after application increased. <b>Oxadiazon</b> only caused significant damage 30 days after application under all three rates. Other treatments showed no marked injuries under any rate or date after application, as compared with the control. Effects on other measured traits depended on the trait, herbicide, and herbicide rate. The highest SPAD, leaf number, shoot diameter, fresh weight and dry weight, was recorded under application of 30 mg a. i. ∙ kg- 1 soil oxadiargyl and 90 mg a. i. ∙ kg- 1 soil <b>oxadiazon,</b> 81 mg a. i. ∙ kg- 1 soil haloxyfop-R, 37. 5 mg a. i. ∙ kg- 1 soil oxadiargyl, 22. 5 mg a. i. ∙ kg- 1 soil oxadiargyl, 81 mg a. i. ∙ kg- 1 soil haloxyfop-R, and 81 mg a. i. ∙ kg- 1 soil haloxyfop-R, respectively. To sum up, the results showed that sethoxydim, oxadiargyl, and haloxyfop-R produced no significant symptoms of phytotoxicity or reduction of measured traits. This means that oxadiargyl, haloxyfop-R, and sethoxydim may be used safely for weed control of valerian at the rates used in this experiment under similar conditions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Weeds and {{weed control}} {{are a major}} problem in the growth and {{management}} of Eucalyptus trees. Annual, biennial and perennial. weed species are common in sites to be planted. These weeds should be controlled before planting. Preplant, preemergence and postemergence herbicides are discussed. Safe preemergence herbicides include oryzalin, napropamide, <b>oxadiazon,</b> linuron and to a lesser degree simazine, atrazine and diuron. Glyphosate, amino triazole and paraquat have been used safely and efficaceously [sic] postemergence. Combinations of mechanical and chemical weed control help allow maximum tree establishment and growth. Weeds are plants that compete for water...|$|E
40|$|Farmers in many Asian {{countries}} are moving from puddled-transplanted rice to dry-seeded rice systems. Dry-seeded rice can be sown after land preparation or under zero-till conditions. Weeds, however, {{are the major}} constraint {{to the production of}} dry-seeded rice. A study was conducted during the wet season of 2011 and dry season of 2012 at the farm of the International Rice Research Institute to evaluate the effect of tillage systems (zero-till and conventional tillage) and herbicides on weed emergence, weed growth, and grain yield in dry-seeded rice systems. In the zero-till system, the densities of Digitaria ciliaris, Eleusine indica, Eclipta prostrata, and Ludwigia octovalvis increased many-fold from the first season to the second. The efficacy of herbicides (<b>oxadiazon</b> followed by fenoxaprop+ethoxysulfuron and <b>oxadiazon</b> followed by penoxsulam+cyhalofop) was lower in the zero-till system than in the conventional tillage system. Grain yield in the herbicide-treated and weed-free plots was similar between the tillage systems and this response was consistent during both the seasons. However, grain yield in the zero-till-control (one hand-weeded) plots was lower (0. 9 - 1. 5 tha - 1) than in the conventional tillage-control plots. The information gained from this study suggests that yields in zero-till systems similar to those in conventional-tilled systems can be achieved if weeds are effectively controlled. In the absence of effective weed control, zero-till systems may result in poor grain yield...|$|E
