5|$|In the 1960s, the Pentecostal Holiness Church {{began to}} branch <b>out</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> United States by affiliating with sister Pentecostal bodies {{in other parts}} of the world. In 1967, an {{affiliation}} was formed with the Pentecostal Methodist Church of Chile, one of the largest national Pentecostal churches in the world and the largest non-Catholic church in Chile. At the time, the Jotabeche Pentecostal Methodist congregation was the largest church in the world with over 60,000 members. With over 150,000 members, it ranks second to the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, South Korea. This denomination claims 1.7 million adherents. A similar affiliation was forged in 1985 with the Wesleyan Methodist Church of Brazil. A Neo-Pentecostal body with roots in the Brazilian Methodist Church, the Wesleyan Church numbered some 50,000 members and adherents in 1995. The word International was added to the church's name in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} higher boiling points, only metals and silicates could exist in solid {{form in the}} warm inner Solar System close to the Sun, and these would {{eventually}} form the rocky planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements only comprised a very {{small fraction of the}} solar nebula, the terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further <b>out,</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid. The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt, Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud. The Nice model is an explanation for the creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through various gravitational interactions.|$|E

25|$|Rip {{currents}} are water {{channels that}} flow {{away from the}} shore. Under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Since a rip current {{appears to be an}} area of flat water, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried <b>out</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> breaking waves. Although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of forty or fifty feet. However, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a rip current. Alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a rip current because it is a fast and effortless way to get <b>out</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> zone of breaking waves.|$|E

25|$|Fox, and William Penn, {{made public}} vows of pacifism and preached a new {{theology}} {{of peace and}} love. Other Puritans contented themselves with being able to meet freely and act on local parishes. They distanced themselves from the harshest sides of their religion that had led to the abuses of Cromwell's reign. Two religious authors stand <b>out</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> others in this time: John Bunyan and Izaak Walton.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of his reign, Yazdegerd II gathered a mixed army of various nations, including his Indian allies, and attacked the Eastern Roman Empire in 441, but peace was soon restored after small-scale fighting. He then gathered his forces in Nishapur in 443 and launched a prolonged campaign against the Kidarites. Finally, after a number of battles, he crushed the Kidarites and drove them <b>out</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> Oxus river in 450.|$|E
25|$|Now firmly {{established}} in the Persian Empire, with centres in Nisibis, Ctesiphon, and Gundeshapur, and several metropolitan sees, the Church of the East began to branch <b>out</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> Sasanian Empire. However, through the 6th century the church was frequently beset with internal strife and persecution from the Zoroastrians. The infighting led to a schism, which lasted from 521 until around 539, when the issues were resolved. However, immediately afterward Byzantine-Persian conflict led to a renewed persecution of the church by the Sasanian emperor Khosrau I; this ended in 545. The church survived these trials {{under the guidance of}} Patriarch Aba I, who had converted to Christianity from Zoroastrianism.|$|E

25|$|The {{empennage}} of the Hydro-triplane {{was supported}} {{on a pair}} of lattice girders, parallel in plan and each constructed from a horizontal member fixed to the upper wing {{at the top of the}} innermost interplane struts and a member below it which sloped upward from the lower wing to meet the upper one at the tail. Three sloping cross braces completed each girder. The rectangular tailplane, fitted with elevators, was placed over the ends of the girders, its leading edge braced by a central, vertical strut to the hull which also supported the rudder post <b>out</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> hull on upper and lower sloping struts. The trapezoidal rudder extended a little above the horizontal tail, which had a deep V-shaped cut-out to accommodate its movement.|$|E
25|$|Spinal disc herniation, {{also known}} as a slipped disc, is a medical {{condition}} affecting the spine in which a tear in the outer, fibrous ring of an intervertebral disc allows the soft, central portion to bulge <b>out</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> damaged outer rings. Disc herniation is usually due to age-related degeneration of the outer ring, known as the anulus fibrosus, although trauma, lifting injuries, or straining have been implicated as well. Tears are almost always postero-lateral (on the back of the sides) owing to the presence of the posterior longitudinal ligament in the spinal canal. This tear in the disc ring may result in the release of chemicals causing inflammation, which may directly cause severe pain {{even in the absence of}} nerve root compression.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{development}} as an Indianapolis neighborhood, the area {{now known as}} Cottage Home was part of two farms owned by prominent Indiana citizens. The land south of St. Clair Street belonged to Noah Noble, fifth Governor of Indiana who bankrupted the State {{with the passage of}} the Indiana Mammoth Internal Improvement Act. The land north of St. Clair Street belonged to Robert Hanna, who was a member of the Indiana constitutional convention and succeeded Noble's brother James as U.S. Senator upon James's death in 1831. After the railroad reached Indianapolis in 1847, the resulting economic boom pushed the city's boundaries <b>out</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> Mile Square. By the end of the Civil War, the arsenal, which would later be adapted for use as Arsenal Technical High School, was built on the eastern border of Cottage Home and the streetcar reached St. Clair Street just a few blocks to the west, providing access to jobs for the area's residents. The Noble farm was platted in 1865 and the Hanna farm in 1868, and both additions were annexed to the City of Indianapolis in 1870.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the loss}} of marine life, the initial burning of the oil and the {{successful}} removal of the bow section prevented {{what could have been}} a worse spill. Captain Mike Hall of the Coast Guard stated that [...] "at least 82 percent of the oil on board New Carissa never reached the wildlife or the pristine shoreline of Oregon's coast". The environmental impact of the sinking of the bow section was thought to be minimized since it was towed <b>out</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> continental shelf, into very deep water. Any remaining oil on board is unlikely to have affected marine life since the low temperatures at the bottom of the ocean would have caused it to solidify.|$|E

One source called Cody: [...] "the interference-smashingest, goal-cageingest, home-run knockingest, super-athlete in all Dixie." [...] Nashville Banner sportswriter and Vanderbilt alumnus Fred Russell described Cody: [...] "When I think of Josh in his college days, I get a mental picture of this great big fellow playing catcher in the spring between innings running <b>out</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> outfield to throw the shot or the discus in his baseball uniform. He was unbelievably skilled and nimble for a big man in basketball, and in football where he's a legend." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{remainder}} of the inner court was built by Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, in the 1570s. He built a tower now known as Leicester's building on the south edge of the court as a guest wing, extending <b>out</b> <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> inner bailey wall for extra space. Leicester's building was four floors high and built in a fashionable contemporary Tudor style with [...] "brittle, thin walls and grids of windows". The building was intended to appear well-proportioned alongside the ancient great tower, {{one of the reasons}} for its considerable height. Leicester's building set the style for later Elizabethan country house design, especially in the Midlands, with Hardwick Hall being a classic example. Modern viewing platforms, installed in 2014, provide views from Elizabeth I's's former bedroom.|$|E
