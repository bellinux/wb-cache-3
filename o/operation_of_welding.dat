40|$|To {{ensure that}} {{occupational}} radiation exposures are ALARA, two primary factors were considered: (1) minimizing occupational exposure during canister loading and (2) minimizing storage dose rates. Occupational exposure is minimized by shielding {{incorporated into the}} canister, transfer cask, and handling equipment, remote <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>welding</b> and handling equipment, and proven procedures for performing fuel loading. Storage dose rates are minimized by five feet of concrete shielding present in the module roof, use of self shielding by placing modules directly adjacent to one another, and by facing the lowest dose rate side of the module arrays toward the limiting boundary of the facility, where possible. 10. 1. 1 Policy Considerations The 24 PT 1 -DSC, transfer cask and AHSM design incorporates various methods of shielding and design features to minimize occupational radiation exposures.

40|$|Problem statement: Elastic {{cylindrical}} shells {{are common}} {{structures in the}} fields of civil engineering and engineering mechanics. These thin-walled constructions may undergo buckling when subjected to axial compression. Buckling limits to large extent their strength performance. This phenomenon depends hugely on the initial distributed or localized geometric imperfections that are present on the shell structure. Localized geometric imperfections result in general from the <b>operation</b> <b>of</b> <b>welding</b> strakes to assemble the shell structure. In this study, reliability of buckling strength as it could be affected by shell material and geometry parameters was investigated. The localized geometric imperfections were chosen to be entering and having either a triangular or a wavelet form. Interaction between three localized imperfections had also been considered. Approach: A special software package which was dedicated to buckling analysis of quasi axisymmetric shells was used in order to compute the buckling load via the linear Euler buckling procedure. A set of five factors including shell aspect ratios, defect characteristics and the distance separating the localized initial geometric imperfections had been found to govern the buckling problem. A parametric study was performed to determine their relative influence on the buckling load reduction. Reliability analysis was carried out by using first order reliability method. Results: Wavelet imperfection was found to be more severe than triangular form in the range of low amplitude imperfections. It was shown also by comparison with the single imperfection case that further diminution of the critical load is obtained for three interacting imperfections. The interval distance separating the localized geometric imperfections was found to have important influence on the reliability index. Conclusion/Recommendations: In the he range of investigated parameters, reliability was found to increase with the distance separating the localized geometric imperfections. This can help performing optimal design of assembled strakes...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The uses of Acoustic Emission (AE) {{in process}} monitoring, {{particularly}} in the automotive sector, are little known but very varied (welding, straightening, drawing, machining, etc.) The most common use {{is no doubt in}} the straightening of gear box and steering rack rods. Tears or cracks may occur when tubes are formed or deep drawn. AE can be used to detect the point in the process where the crack occurs (in the case of multiple step processes or multi-station presses). Once this crucial point has been identified, it is then possible to adapt the production process or the metallurgy in order to prevent this damage from occurring. A press has been instrumented {{in order to be able}} to continuously control the production process. The first step when defining the feasibility of a process is performed using a multi-purpose AE system such as those used in research laboratories. Once the process has been clearly identified and the process noise has been characterized, a simplified control system is then defined and put in place on the production lines. Today, the mill decided to first study the localization <b>of</b> the <b>weld</b> seam before implemented the AE process monitoring.

One of Scania's modular systems was the one for welded crossmembers. Scania uses a casted crossmember in their trailer truck for 4 x 2 chassis with air suspension. Because of the relatively high production costs for the casted crossmember a welded crossmember has been designed earlier on Scania. The design <b>of</b> the <b>welded</b> crossmember was not complete because it missed solutions for attachment of valves. This project was in collaboration between Scania in Södertälje and Ferruform in Luleå. The design of the crossmember was carried out in Södertälje and the production part of the project was carried out in Luleå. The goal of the project was to design a modular crossmember program for welded crossmembers and to suggest production line for the beams. Crossmembers with similar production operations were analyzed to minimize production costs. The welded air suspension beam should be fully designed. The beams studied were all closed, welded crossmembers which required production <b>operations</b> <b>of</b> pressing, <b>welding</b> and machining. The beams studied were air suspension beam of 4 x 2 chassis frame, GB-tipperbeam and two different endbeams. None of the beams could directly be combined because the stiffness differed too much, however the beams could be redesigned to facilitate the production. Three new air suspension beams and two new GB-tipper beams was designed and the strength <b>of</b> the <b>welds</b> were studied using Finite element analysis for the current load cases. The results showed that the stresses in both air suspension beam and GB-tipperbalken decreased with the new design. A proposal for a production line for welded crossmembers was developed with production operations, cutting, pressing, welding, machining, finishing and assembly. To manage the entire flow of crossmembers three NCmachines were needed and one laser machines.
