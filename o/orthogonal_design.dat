This paper offers techniques for constructing quaternion <b>orthogonal</b> <b>designs</b> via combinations of specially chosen complex <b>orthogonal</b> <b>designs.</b> One technique is used to build quaternion <b>orthogonal</b> <b>designs</b> on complex variables for any even number of columns. A second related technique is applied to maximum rate complex <b>orthogonal</b> <b>designs</b> to generate an infinite family of quaternion <b>orthogonal</b> <b>designs</b> on complex variables such that the resulting designs have no zero entries. This second technique {{is also used to}} generate an infinite family of quaternion <b>orthogonal</b> <b>designs</b> defined over quaternion variables that display a regular redundancy.

50|$|The town {{construction}} {{was done at}} a single stage while preserving the principles of <b>orthogonal</b> <b>design</b> (the so-called “Hippodamus system”). The two gates were located to the North-West and South-West and represented a starting point of the main streets which crossed each other under right angle at the square (the “Agora” Greek άγορά). Another street was used {{to pass through the}} inner side, along the whole fortress wall. The town was equipped with a water and sewerage system while several wells satisfied the citizens’ needs for fresh water.

50|$|The central idiom in policy-based {{design is}} a class {{template}} (called the host class), taking several type parameters as input, which are instantiated with types {{selected by the}} user (called policy classes), each implementing a particular implicit interface (called a policy), and encapsulating some orthogonal (or mostly orthogonal) aspect {{of the behavior of}} the instantiated host class. By supplying a host class combined with a set of different, canned implementations for each policy, a library or module can support an exponential number of different behavior combinations, resolved at compile time, and selected by mixing and matching the different supplied policy classes in the instantiation of the host class template. Additionally, by writing a custom implementation of a given policy, a policy-based library can be used in situations requiring behaviors unforeseen by the library implementor. Even in cases where no more than one implementation of each policy will ever be used, decomposing a class into policies can aid the design process, by increasing modularity and highlighting exactly where <b>orthogonal</b> <b>design</b> decisions have been made.|$|E

50|$|In some configurations, the piezo {{components}} can {{be arranged}} in a tripod design. In this type of set-up, the x, y and z components are arranged orthogonally to one another with their apex attached to a movable pivot point. Similar to the cylindrical piezo, in the tripod design the voltage {{is applied to the}} piezo corresponding to the appropriate direction of tip displacement. In this type of set-up the sample and substrate are mounted on top of the z-piezo component. When the x and y piezo components are in use, the <b>orthogonal</b> <b>design</b> causes them to push against the base of the z-piezo, causing the z-piezo to rotate about a fixed point. Applying voltage to the z-piezo causes the tube to move up and down on its pivot point. The other essential components of AFM instrumentation include the AFM tip module, which includes: the AFM tip, the cantilever, and the guiding laser.When the piezo-tube is positioned above the cantilever and tip, the guiding laser is focused through the tube and onto a mirror that rests on tip of the cantilever. The guiding laser is reflected off of the mirror and detected by a photodetector. The laser senses when the forces acting on the tip change. The reflected laser beam from this phenomenon reaches the detector. The output from this detector acts {{as a response to the}} changes in force and the cantilever adjusts the position of the tip, while keeping constant the force that acts on the tip.|$|E
