The book states that the truth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Guo Yunshen actually fought one of his older xingyi brothers and lost. Sun Lutang was a student of both Guo Yunshen and Cheng Tinghua so this stance on the subject {{seems to be one}} of the most accurate.|$|E
25|$|The fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we’re in our thirties now {{and that}} breakup {{happened}} ten years ago. As a human being you just don't want that kind of karma. We {{did a lot of}} shit talking, and they did a lot of shit talking, so I just called everybody up and invited them to my house and said ‘hey, listen, we’re in our thirties now, I’m sorry for whatever I said, I'm sure you guys didn’t mean what you said–you guys were upset because I split up the band and we were upset because of whatever. Let’s be friends again. But do I want to reunite and play fucking 15-year old songs? Well, it would be like asking you, ‘do you want to get back together with your first girlfriend?’ You learn some amazing things together, but I just shudder at the thought. We were a band that went out on top, which is good, but it’s just a coincidence. We were also a band that had been together for seven years, and for six of those years played to nobody and had a great time but were also on the verge of splitting up many times before that. It’s an old relationship. People would like {{to think of it as}} unfinished business because to them we went out when we were most popular, but that has nothing to do with the creative element. As far as the creative element went, it very much was finished business. That’s why I ended the band! Now, thank god, fucking ten years later, we're not holding a grudge and we’re all cool with it. People pick up on the difference of attitude and think 'oh, this could mean a possible reunion', but that’s just them projecting their own desires upon us.|$|E

500|$|Sino–Soviet {{relations}} {{had long}} been strained, and as Suslov told the Central Committee {{in one of his}} reports, [...] "The crux <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Leadership of the CCP has recently developed tendencies to exaggerate the degree of maturity of socialist relations in China... There are elements of conceit and haughtiness. [...] are largely explained by the atmosphere of the cult of personality of comrade Mao Zedong... who, by all accounts, himself has come to believe in his own infallibility."

500|$|There is an {{idealization}} of the [...] {{as presented}} in the film. In all but one case, the dead are either young or already made-up, such that [...] "the viewer can easily tolerate these images on the screen". The one corpse {{that had not been}} found for several days is never shown on screen. No bodies show the gaunt figure of one who has died after a long illness, or the cuts and bruises of an accident victim. Japanologist Mark R. Mullins writes that the gratitude shown in Departures would probably not have occurred in real life; according to Coffinman, there [...] "is nothing lower on the social scale than the mortician, and the truth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] fear the coffinman and the cremator just as much as death and the corpse".|$|E
500|$|Zappa {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as one of the most significant electric guitar soloists. In a 1983 issue of Guitar World, Jon Swenson declared: [...] "the fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] is one of the greatest guitarists we have and is sorely unappreciated as such." [...] His idiosyncratic style developed gradually and was mature by the early 1980s, by which time his live performances featured lengthy improvised solos during many songs. A November 2016 feature by the editors of Guitar Player magazine wrote: [...] "Brimming with sophisticated motifs and convoluted rhythms, Zappa's extended excursions are more akin to symphonies than they are to guitar solos." [...] The symphonic comparison stems from his habit of introducing melodic themes that, like a symphony's main melodies, were repeated with variations throughout his solos. He was further described as using a wide variety of scales and modes, enlivened by [...] "unusual rhythmic combinations". His left hand was capable of smooth legato technique, while Zappa's right was [...] "one of the fastest pick hands in the business." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video game}} version of Mona Sax was {{critically}} acclaimed for {{being one of}} [...] "relatively complex, non-stereotypical female game characters". She was included on the 2007 list of 50 greatest female characters in video game history by Tom's Games, where she was described as [...] "a stone-cold killer who's incredibly tempting but not entirely trustworthy" [...] and [...] "the perfect female accomplice to Max Payne." [...] In 2008, PC Games Hardware also listed her {{as one of the}} most important female characters in video games. In 2012, David Sanchez of GameZone proposed that Mona appear in her own spin-off game, calling her [...] "one of the sexiest femme fatales in all of gaming", and added, [...] "The fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Mona Sax is one hell of a character — one that hasn't starred in her very own game, but one that could very well do so and deliver an unforgettable experience." [...] That same year, Austin Yorski of Blistered Thumbs listed Mona among his personal favorites while discussing the portrayals of video game female characters. In 2013, Complex ranked her as the 20th-best supporting character in video games.|$|E

500|$|Partly in {{reaction}} to such theories, another school of thought emerged which argued that Arthur had no historical existence at all. Morris's Age of Arthur prompted the archaeologist Nowell Myres to observe that [...] "no figure on the borderline of history and mythology has wasted more of the historian's time". Gildas' 6th-century polemic De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae (On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain), written within living memory of Badon, mentions the battle but does not mention Arthur. Arthur is {{not mentioned in the}} Anglo-Saxon Chronicle or named in any surviving manuscript written between 400 and 820. He is absent from Bede's early-8th-century Ecclesiastical History of the English People, another major early source for post-Roman history that mentions Badon. The historian David Dumville has written: [...] "I think we can dispose of him [...] quite briefly. He owes his place in our history books to a 'no smoke without fire' school of thought... The fact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there is no historical evidence about Arthur; we must reject him from our histories and, above all, from the titles of our books." ...|$|E

It has low-resolution backgrounds, and pretty much nothing at all to get excited about". He also called the music [...] "boring and {{completely}} uninspiring". Allgame editor Matt Grandstaff commended the card games, as they [...] "require a fair amount of strategy, and thus remain entertaining" [...] and that [...] "the look and feel of Caesars Palace 2000 recaptures the feel {{of one of the most}} successful casinos of all-time". He stated that the game [...] "is definitely not about the looks" [...] but [...] "does an admirable job recreating the casino experience". Grandstaff felt that the game [...] "has the sound of a real casino. From background clatter to the voices of the dealer, this is Caesar's Palace". He noted that players [...] "will enjoy sitting through hours of card games" [...] but to [...] "Avoid the slots". Grandstaff also commented that the strategy book that comes with the game [...] "should be packed on any trip to Vegas".|$|E
500|$|The university's SRC was {{affiliated}} with the National Union of South African Students (NUSAS). NUSAS had taken pains to cultivate a multi-racial membership but remained white-dominated {{because the majority of}} South Africa's students were from the country's white minority. As Clive Nettleton, a white NUSAS leader, put it: [...] "the essence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> NUSAS was founded on white initiative, is financed by white money and reflects the opinions of the majority of its members who are white". NUSAS officially opposed apartheid, but it moderated its opposition {{in order to maintain the}} support of conservative white students. Biko and several other black African NUSAS members were frustrated when it organised parties in white dormitories, which black Africans were forbidden to enter. In July 1967, a NUSAS conference was held at Rhodes University in Grahamstown; after the students arrived, they found that dormitory accommodation had been arranged for the white and Indian delegates but not the black Africans, who were told that they could sleep in a local church. Biko and other black African delegates walked out of the conference in anger. Biko later related that this event forced him to rethink his belief in the multi-racial approach to political activism: ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Willard Quine, [...] "provide for ... {{the whole}} sweep of {{abstract}} set theory. The crux <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Schönfinkel lets functions stand as arguments. For Schönfinkel, substantially as for Frege, classes are special sorts of functions. They are propositional functions, functions whose values are truth values. All functions, propositional and otherwise, are for Schönfinkel one-place functions". Remarkably, Schönfinkel reduces all mathematics to an extremely compact functional calculus consisting {{of only three}} functions: Constancy, fusion (i.e., composition), and mutual exclusivity. Quine notes that Haskell Curry (1958) carried this work forward [...] "under the head of combinatory logic".|$|E
2500|$|In the Eighth {{series of}} Ethical Addresses (1901), after {{referring}} to [...] "Ament and his pious frauds', Ament's motivations are explored: [...] "It {{is because the}} Rev.

[...] In the same publication, however, referring to Ament: [...] "The truth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matter</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the missionary has been made the scapegoat by conspiring and corrupt native officials, and by immoral foreigners now in China and their ignorant brethren here in the United States." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{historical}} {{basis for}} King Arthur {{is a source}} of considerable debate among historians. Due to the paucity of British records from the period 450–550 AD, historian Thomas Charles-Edwards noted that [...] "at this stage of the enquiry, one can only say that there may well have been a historical Arthur [...] the historian can as yet say nothing of value about him". Historian David Dumville summed up his position: [...] "I think we can dispose of him [...] quite briefly. He owes his place in our history books to a 'no smoke without fire' school of thought...
