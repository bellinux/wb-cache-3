40|$|Instead {{of their}} {{remarkable}} progress in practical use, the optical whitening agents have many uncultivated problems owing to their speciality {{that they have}} no apparent colour but reveal their effects only by the excitation of the ultra-violet rays contained in sun-beams. On the way of our efforts, elucidating the dyeing properties of some fluorescent dyes, chiefly the substantive cotton dyes of stilben series, we have found some fundamental phenomena concerning the relationship between the intensity of fluorescence and the quantity of dyestuff dyed on the cotton fiber. Our chief results may be summerized as follows. 1) Fluorescence of the <b>optical</b> <b>whitening</b> <b>agent</b> on fibers as well as in solution, decreases its intensity as the concentration increases over a certain limit : so-called concentration quenching. 2) Quantitative relationship between the quantity of dyestuff on fiber and the intensity of fluorescence has been determined. 3) The difficulty of determining the apparent brightness of the dyed fibers was discussed. 4) Sensitizing effects of fluorescence by some neutral salts and soaps, are observed and this pr eliminary report is presented...|$|E
40|$|If a {{high level}} of {{whiteness}} is required for wool and wool blends, it is normal to carry out a combined oxidative/reductive bleaching treatments. A higher whiteness can be achieved by the use of optical whitening agents. The aim of this experimental work was to whiten 50 / 50 % PES/Wo woven fabrics. 50 / 50 % PES/Wool fabrics were first bleached in acidic conditions by hydrogen peroxide, and then, the reduction washing processes were carried out by sodium hydrosulphite (Merck), thiourea dioxide (Merck) or sodium borohydride (DyStar). The optical whitening agents, Hostalux ETB Liq. and Leucophor BSB Liq. were later applied at four different concentrations either in a single bath or in two separate baths to the fabrics treated with one of these three chemicals. The processes were repeated twice to check the repeatability of the results. The optical whitening processes were carried out in a laboratory type HT machine (Roaches). The colour measurements were carried out by Datacolor SF 600 + spectrophotometer. The Whiteness Indexes of the optically whitened samples were evaluated in accordance with CIE Whiteness Index. The <b>optical</b> <b>whitening</b> <b>agent</b> used for wool gave better results, and also the best results were obtained in single-bath treatments.

Bladder cancers have been reported in occupationally exposed groups but coexposures with other chemicals limits conclusions. Animal testing also shows that aniline damages red blood cells and causes toxic effects in the blood system (i. e., spleen, bone marrow, kidney, and liver). 2 Overexposure in humans causes methemoglobinemia and cyanosis. 2, 4 Exposure Aniline is used primarily as a chemical intermediate in production of MDA (methylene di-aniline), a starting product for polyurethane plastics. In the rubber industry, aniline is used in the manufacture of antioxidants and rubber accelerators.

40|$|Zircon is {{the main}} {{opacifier}} in the ceramic sector, however its high cost limits its wide use and {{has led to the}} search of alternative materials.

40|$|In an in vivo study, {{the authors}} tested the {{hypothesis}} that no difference in enamel surface roughness is detectable either during or after bleaching with a high-concentration in-office <b>whitening</b> <b>agent.</b> METHODS: The authors performed profilometric and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) analyses of epoxy resin replicas of the upper right incisors of 20 participants at baseline (control) and after each bleaching treatment with a 38 percent hydrogen peroxide <b>whitening</b> <b>agent,</b> applied four times, at one-week intervals.

40|$|Abstract: Tyrosinase {{is the key}} and {{rate-limiting enzyme}} {{responsible}} for the conversion of tyrosine into melanin. Competitive inhibition of tyrosinase enzymatic activity results in decreased or absent melanin synthesis by melanocytes in human skin. DeoxyArbutin (4 -[(tetrahydro- 2 H-pyran- 2 -yl) oxy]phenol), a novel skin <b>whitening</b> <b>agent,</b> was synthesized through the removal of hydroxyl groups from the glucose side-chain of arbutin. DeoxyArbutin not only shows greater inhibition of tyrosinase activity but is also safer than hydroquinone and arbutin. Hence, deoxyArbutin is a potential skin <b>whitening</b> <b>agent</b> for cosmetics and depigmenting drugs; however, stability of this compound under some conditions remains a problem. The lack of stability poses developmental and practical difficulties {{for the use of}} deoxyArbutin in cosmetics and medicines. Improving the thermostability of deoxyArbutin is an important issue for its development. In this research, we established an analytical procedure to verify the amount of deoxyArbutin in solutions using a high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method.

And, we found that Coumaric acid-LG-NH 2 inhibited tyrosinase activity dose-dependently and showed superior tyrosinase inhibitory activity to well-known <b>whitening</b> <b>agent,</b> arbutin. IC 50 value of Coumaric acid-LG-NH 2 was 182. 4 μM, and IC 50 value of arbutin was 384. 6 μM. Also, in measurement of melanin contents using B 16 F 1 melanoma cell lines, Coumaric acid-LG-NH 2 reduced melanin production induced by α-MSH statistically significant, and showed superior melanin inhibitory activity to p-coumaric acid or arbutin.

Atomic force microscopy showed a fiber surface with disoriented nanometric domains using both tapping-mode height and phase image modes.
