Halle Berry was nominated for Choice Movie Actress in a Drama at the Teen Choice Awards and Best Actress at the BET Awards while the film itself received mixed reviews from critics, but praised Berry's performance and the film's suspense.|$|E

5|$|Call of Duty 2 is a 2005 first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by Infinity Ward {{and published by}} Konami in Japan and Activision {{in the rest of}} the world. It is the second installment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Call</b> of Duty series. The game was released on October 25, 2005 for Microsoft Windows and on November 22, 2005 as a launch game for the Xbox 360 in Europe, Australia and South America, and later in Japan. Other versions were released on other platforms, including mobile phones as well as Pocket PCs.|$|E
5|$|Females are {{generally}} attracted to males by their calls, though in nonstridulatory species, some other mechanism must be involved. After the pair has made antennal contact, a courtship period may occur {{during which the}} character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> changes. The female mounts the male and a single spermatophore is transferred to the external genitalia of the female. Sperm flows from this into the female's oviduct {{over a period of}} a few minutes or up to an hour, depending on species. After copulation, the female may remove or eat the spermatophore; males may attempt to prevent this with various ritualised behaviours. The female may mate on several occasions with different males.|$|E
5|$|Many rodent species, {{particularly}} those that are diurnal and social, have {{a wide range of}} alarm calls that are emitted when they perceive threats. There are both direct and indirect benefits of doing this. A potential predator may stop when it knows it has been detected, or an alarm call can allow conspecifics or related individuals to take evasive action. Several species, for example prairie dogs, have complex anti-predator alarm call systems. These species may have different calls for different predators (e.g. aerial predators or ground-based predators) and each call contains information {{about the nature of the}} precise threat. The urgency of the threat is also conveyed by the acoustic properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>call.</b>|$|E

5|$|The call or croak of a frog {{is unique}} to its species. Frogs create this sound by passing air through the larynx in the throat. In most calling frogs, the sound is amplified {{by one or more}} vocal sacs, {{membranes}} of skin under the throat or {{on the corner of the}} mouth, that distend during the amplification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>call.</b> Some frog calls are so loud that they can be heard up to a mile away.|$|E
5|$|The yodel is a {{long and}} complex call made only by the male. It {{is used in the}} {{establishment}} of territorial boundaries and in territorial confrontations, and the length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>call</b> corresponds with the loon's level of aggression. The dominant frequencies in the yodel indicate the body mass and thereby the health of males. A male that occupies a new territory appears to alter its yodel to be clearly distinguishable from the call of the previous territory owner.|$|E
5|$|However, {{others found}} that the {{bundling}} of the games was a sensible business decision, most highlighting {{the risk that the}} sales of Remastered could overshadow those of Infinite Warfare and result in direct competition between the two. Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the impulsiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Call</b> of Duty fanbase, writing that due to the series' popularity, many of the individuals who felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to buy it regardless. As such, Activision had released the bundle with the knowledge that fans would certainly purchase Infinite Warfare in order to obtain a remaster of Modern Warfare, a game that was held in such high regard. While Wright did disagree with having to pay for an unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that the bundle would be good value for money.|$|E
40|$|Sound {{frequency}} {{patterns and}} sound pressure levels of distress calls from pups of several litters of albino mice were analysed. Practically all the characteristics measured (length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>calls,</b> initial, terminal, minimum and maximum sound frequency, total bandwidth and sound pressure) changed with successive days of age. However, only <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>calls,</b> their bandwidth and their sound pressure {{developed in a}} regular way and all decreased as the pups grew older. The other measures fluctuated considerably but did not show any definite trend. It is suggested that reduction in <b>the</b> acoustic energy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>calls</b> (intensity × duration) could decrease their effectiveness in eliciting maternal responses and could be <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> reduced cold stress as the pups develop homoiothermy. © 1969.
