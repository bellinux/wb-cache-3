5|$|In 1968–69, Greaves scored 27 {{goals in}} 42 league games to finish as the First Division's leading scorer {{for the sixth}} and final time. He scored four of his goals in one match against Sunderland, and also scored hat-tricks against Burnley and Leicester City. His nine goals in cup competitions, {{including}} a hat-trick against Exeter City, left him with an <b>overall</b> <b>goal</b> tally of 36 in 52 games. Spurs performed inconsistently in the 1969–70 season, and Greaves was dropped from the first team after playing in an FA Cup defeat to Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on 28 January 1970. He was never recalled to the starting line-up, but still ended the season as the club's joint top scorer (with Martin Chivers), having scored 11 goals in 33 matches.|$|E
5|$|On March 23, 1943, {{he headed}} up a {{committee}} of USAAF and RAF commanders {{to draw up a}} plan for the Combined Bomber Offensive (CBO). Despite the fact that it altered the target system priorities outlined in AWPD-42, and changed the <b>overall</b> <b>goal</b> of the offensive from knocking Germany out of the war using airpower to one of preparing for the invasion of Europe, Hansell approved the designation of the German aircraft industry as its most important target and the destruction of the German Luftwaffe as its top priority. Hansell wrote the final draft of the CBO plan himself. Although Hansell did not personally participate in later strategic bombing operations against Germany, he had been instrumental in setting in motion the plans and policies that led to the near total destruction of German war industry.|$|E

25|$|The <b>overall</b> <b>goal</b> is for an {{individual}} to eventually not need prompts. As {{an individual}} gains mastery of a skill at a particular prompt level, the prompt is faded to a less intrusive prompt.

Lyon won their last group game against Dinamo Zagreb with 7–1 (after being 0–1 down at half time) while Ajax lost 0–3 against Real Madrid (in which two goals from Ajax were wrongfully cancelled). The aggregate goal {{difference in}} both games {{would have to be}} at least 7 goals for Lyon to advance, and in fact it was 9.|$|E
25|$|The first {{emissions}} trading market {{was established in}} the United States by enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The <b>overall</b> <b>goal</b> of the Acid Rain Program established by the Act is to achieve significant environmental and public health benefits through reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), the primary causes of acid rain.

25|$|The {{growth of}} managed care in the U.S. was spurred by the {{enactment}} of the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. While managed care techniques were pioneered by health maintenance organizations, they are now used by a variety of private health benefit programs. Managed care is now nearly ubiquitous in the U.S, but has attracted controversy because it has had mixed results in its <b>overall</b> <b>goal</b> of controlling medical costs. Proponents and critics are also sharply divided on managed care's overall impact on the quality of U.S. health care delivery.|$|E

25|$|Since 1979 {{commercial}} farming {{has replaced}} subsistence farming {{as the dominant}} mode of agricultural production. Some northern and western areas support rain-fed agriculture, while other areas require irrigation for successful crop production. The 1979 Revolution sought self-sufficiency in foodstuffs {{as part of its}} <b>overall</b> <b>goal</b> of decreased economic dependence on the West. Higher government subsidies for grain and other staples and expanded short-term credit and tax exemptions for farmers complying with government quotas were intended by the new regime to promote self-sufficiency. But by early 1987, Iran was actually more dependent on agricultural imports than in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Some {{characteristics}} of stuttered speech {{are not as}} easy for listeners to detect. As a result, diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech-language pathologist (SLP). Diagnosis of stuttering employs information both from direct observation {{of the individual and}} information about the individual’s background, through a case history. Information from both sources should span multiple, various settings and times. The SLP may collect a case history on the individual through a detailed interview or conversation with the parents (if client is a child). They may also observe parent-child interactions and observe the speech patterns of the child's parents. The <b>overall</b> <b>goal</b> of assessment for the SLP will be (1) to determine whether a speech disfluency exists, and (2) assess if its severity warrants concern for further treatment.|$|E
