5|$|A. Your Duty to Self: {{describes}} {{the self as}} the center of the universe, with a call to learn about one's inner nature. Admonishes the reader to develop every faculty in a balanced way, establish one's autonomy, and to devote <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> the service of one's own True Will.|$|E
5|$|Because not all local cults of Isis held mystery rites, not all her devotees {{would have}} {{undergone}} initiation. Nevertheless, both Apuleius's story and Plutarch's On Isis and Osiris suggest that initiation was {{considered part of}} the larger process of joining the cult and dedicating <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> the goddess.|$|E
5|$|Despite renewed {{interest}} from Camacho, then coach of Osasuna, Pablo moved to England, where {{he signed a}} three-year deal with West Bromwich Albion, newly returned to the Premier League, to begin on 1 July 2010 when his contract with Atlético expired. He made his debut on {{the opening day of}} the season, partnering Gabriel Tamaș in central defence as Albion lost 6–0 at Chelsea, and scored his first goal ten days later, in a 2–0 win at League One (third-tier) club Leyton Orient in the League Cup. He was used sporadically, making only ten Premier League appearances, of which just two came in 2011. Teammate Jonas Olsson suggested that it took at least a season to accustom <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> English football, especially for someone who spoke little English when he first arrived.|$|E

50|$|Using a person's name <b>to</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>oneself</b> or <b>to</b> address {{another is}} {{considered}} more personal and informal than using pronouns. It {{can be found}} among close friends or children.|$|R

5|$|Under the Tang law code {{compiled}} in the 7th century, severe punishments were outlined {{for those}} who disobeyed or disrespected the hierarchical system of elders. Those who assaulted their parents could be put to death, those who assaulted an older brother could be put to forced labor, and those who assaulted an older cousin could be sentenced to caning. A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death, while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard labor for the state. Yet this reverence for elders and superiors was grounded in more than just secular Confucian discourse; Chinese beliefs of ancestor worship transformed the identity of one's parents into abstract, otherworldly figures. Song society was also built on social relationships governed not by abstract principles, but on the protection gained by devoting <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> a superior.|$|E
25|$|In Advaita Vedanta, the {{ultimate}} goal of life is happiness, in the sense that duality between Atman and Brahman is transcended and one realizes <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> be the Self in all.|$|E

50|$|Scientific {{management}} {{claims to}} be axiologically neutral. In Management Ethique (2012), he shows instead that managerial practice includes ethical and political questions {{not only at the}} meso (the organization) and macro (societal and environmental) but also at the micro level (relation <b>to</b> <b>oneself</b> and <b>to</b> others).|$|R
25|$|In Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada (2004), the Supreme Court ruled 5–4 {{that being}} {{required}} to identify <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> police under states' stop and identify statutes is not an unreasonable search or seizure, and is not necessarily self-incrimination.|$|E
25|$|The review {{looks at}} the extreme {{consequences}} to which communication problems can lead; from initial frustration at {{not being able to}} express <b>oneself,</b> <b>to</b> bullying or being bullied at school, fewer job prospects and even a descent into criminality.|$|E
25|$|By {{limiting}} <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> sets defined only {{in terms}} of what has already been constructed, one ensures that the resulting sets will be constructed {{in a way that is}} independent of the peculiarities of the surrounding model of set theory and contained in any such model.|$|E

25|$|The Fathers of the Church and the ecclesiastical {{writers of}} the third century {{frequently}} mention Terce, Sext, and None as hours for daily prayers. Tertullian, around the year 200, recommended, {{in addition to the}} obligatory morning and evening prayers, the use of the third, sixth and ninth hours of daylight to remind <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> pray.|$|E
25|$|A {{division}} between Force and consciousness in evolution: matter, life and mind are often warring with each other. Materialists {{try to resolve}} this war by submitting <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> the mortality of our being, while ascetics have tried to reject earthly life. A true solution may lie in finding the principle beyond mind, thereby overcoming the mortality of our existence.|$|E
25|$|Declaration against interest: A {{statement}} that would incriminate or expose the declarant to liability {{to such an}} extent that it can be assumed he would only make such a statement if it were true. It would be assumed that one would lie to further one's interests, so a statement against his interests (such as exposing <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> criminal or civil liability) likely would not be made unless it were true.|$|E

25|$|In 1983, Howard Gardner's Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences {{introduced}} {{the idea that}} traditional types of intelligence, such as IQ, fail to fully explain cognitive ability. He {{introduced the}} idea of multiple intelligences which included both interpersonal intelligence (the capacity to understand the intentions, motivations and desires of other people) and intrapersonal intelligence (the capacity to understand <b>oneself,</b> <b>to</b> appreciate one's feelings, fears and motivations).|$|E
25|$|In this encyclical, Benedict {{reflects}} on the concepts of eros, agape, and philia, and {{their relationship with the}} teachings of Jesus. Eros and agape are two of the various Greek words for love, each of which has a slightly different shade of meaning: agape is descending, oblative love in which one gives of <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> another; eros is ascending, possessive love which seeks to receive from another; philia is the mutual love between friends.|$|E
25|$|Confession of sins is made {{directly}} to God and not through man (except in asking for forgiveness {{from the victim}} of the sin). It is taught that sins are to be kept to <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> seek individual forgiveness from God. God forgives those who seek his forgiveness and commit to themselves not to repeat the sin, although some sins in which another person is victimized are not forgiven unless that person forgives you, so they should also be asked for forgiveness.|$|E
50|$|Intersubjectivity {{also helps}} to {{constitute}} objectivity: {{in the experience of}} the world as available not only <b>to</b> <b>oneself,</b> but also <b>to</b> the Other, there is a bridge between the personal and the shared, the self and the Others.|$|R
50|$|Since 2010 Graziano's lab {{has studied}} the brain basis of consciousness. Graziano {{proposed}} that specialized machinery in the brain computes the feature of awareness and attributes it to other people in a social context. The same machinery, in that hypothesis, also attributes the feature of awareness <b>to</b> <b>oneself.</b> Damage <b>to</b> that machinery disrupts one's own awareness.|$|R

25|$|The Sacrament of Penance and Reconciliation (commonly called Penance, Reconciliation, or Confession) {{is one of}} {{the seven}} sacraments of the Catholic Church (called sacred mysteries in the Eastern Catholic Churches), in which the {{faithful}} obtain absolution for the sins committed against God and neighbour and are reconciled with the community of the Church. By this sacrament Christians are freed from sins committed after Baptism. The sacrament of Penance is considered the normal way to be absolved from mortal sin, by which one would otherwise condemn <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> Hell.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrines of}} Sikhism teach that the soul exists, and is passed from one body {{to another in}} endless cycles of Saṃsāra, until liberation. Each birth begins karma (karam), these actions leave a karni (karmic signature) on one's soul which {{influences}} rebirth states Sikhism, but it is God whose grace that liberates. The {{way out of the}} reincarnation cycle, asserts Sikhism, is to live an ethical life, devote <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> God and constantly remember God's name. The precepts of Sikhism encourage the bhakti of One Lord for mukti (liberation).|$|E
25|$|Although the {{optimism}} bias occurs for both positive events, such as believing <b>oneself</b> <b>to</b> be more financially successful than others, and negative events, {{such as being}} {{less likely to have}} a drinking problem, there is more research and evidence suggesting that the bias is stronger for negative events. Different consequences result from these two types of events: positive events often lead to feelings of well being and self-esteem, while negative events lead to consequences involving more risk, such as engaging in risky behaviors and not taking precautionary measures for safety.|$|E

50|$|The {{activation}} of implicit stereotypes may be decreased when {{the individual is}} motivated to promote a positive self-image, either <b>to</b> <b>oneself</b> or <b>to</b> others in a social setting. Positive feedback from a black person decreases stereotypic sentence completion, while negative feedback from a black person increases it.Subjects also reveal lesser strength of race stereotypes when they feel others disagree with the stereotypes.|$|R
