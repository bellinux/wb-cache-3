This is so because tiny life forms are injured when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (<b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{access to}} the deep-tube {{platforms}} was by a lift. Each lift was staffed, and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office. The first escalator on the London Underground was installed in 1911 between the District and Piccadilly platforms at Earl's Court and from the following year new deep-level stations were provided with escalators instead of lifts. The escalators had a diagonal shunt at the top landing. In 1921 a recorded voice instructed passengers {{to stand on the}} right and signs followed in World War II. Travellers were asked to stand on the right so that anyone wishing to overtake them would have a clear passage {{on the left side of}} the escalator. The first 'comb' type escalator was installed in 1924 at Clapham Common. In the 1920s and 1930s many lifts were replaced by escalators. After the fatal 1987 King's Cross fire, all wooden escalators were replaced with metal ones and the mechanisms are regularly degreased to lower the potential for fires. The only wooden escalator not to be replaced was at Greenford station, which remained until October 2015 when TfL replaced it with the first incline lift on the UK transport network.|$|E
25|$|Like {{a number}} of other manuscripts that {{comprise}} the Canterbury/Tiberius group, the specific provenance or place (i.e., scriptorium) of manufacture of the Book of Cerne is unknown. This issue of provenance has generated much academic debate within the literature of this Southumbian codex, especially with the two references to Bishop Ædeluald/Oeðelpald, presumably the patron of this codex, within its text. The issue partly revolves around the identity of Bishop Ædeluald/Oeðelpald mentioned in the texts. Some researchers believe that these texts refer to Bishop Ædiluald/Æthelwold (721-740 CE) of Lindisfarne in Northumbria, while others have suggested that the name refers to Bishop Ædeluald (818-830 CE) of Lichfield in Mercia. As early as 1868 J.O Westwood attributed the Book of Cerne to Lindisfarne in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria. Variants of this Lindisfarne recension theory have been supported by subsequent studies written by such scholars as Bishop, Henry, and Dumville. However, other researchers who favor a 9th-century Mercian original have contested this Lindisfarne hypothesis. In 1902 Kuypers recognized this issue in his study of this manuscript where he cautiously identified the patron as the Bishop of Lichfield. More recent studies of the Book of Cerne by Moorish, Wormald, Robinson, Brown, Walker, and Webster have supported the Southumbrian/Mercian hypothesis. Brown has inferred that even if this manuscript is linked to the earlier Bishop of Lindisfarne, the orthography of the acrostic poem suggests that it may have been produced with reference to Bishop Ædeluald of Lichfield, <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> changed with him in mind.|$|E

25|$|Reverend Charles Helm (1844 - 1915), son of Reverend Daniel Helm of the London Missionary Society, {{was born}} in the Cape Colony, joined the London Missionary Society himself, and moved from the Zuurbraak (now Suurbraak) mission station just east of Swellendam (modern Western Cape Province, South Africa) to the Hope Fountain Mission in Matabeleland, Southern Rhodesia, {{travelling}} from October 1874 to December 1875, then bringing two ridged dog bitches from somewhere between Kimberley (modern Northern Cape Province, South Africa) and Swellendam with him to Hope Fountain in 1879 en route to becoming, as it would turn out, a political advisor to King Lobengula, house-host to hunter-explorer Frederick Courteney Selous, postmaster of Bulawayo and well-appreciated tooth-extractor. At Hope Fountain, now part of the city of Bulawayo, fellow South African transplant Cornelis van Rooyen (b. 1860, Uitenhage, modern Eastern Cape Province, South Africa), a biggame hunter, was married to Maria Vermaak of Bloemhof by Reverend Helm in 1879 the same year Helm brought his two rough-coated grey-black bitches to the Mission. Van Rooyen saw Helm's pair of bitches and decided to breed his own dogs with them to incorporate their guarding abilities. It is not known if these two first direct ancestors of Rhodesian ridgebacks had dorsal hair pattern ridges themselves, but they founded the Rhodesian ridgeback bloodline, so either carried the trait <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> added from other Boer dogs and hybrids with Khoikhoi ridgebacks which van Rooyen bred into his lines over many trials then generations.|$|E

500|$|Though McCotter {{had decided}} to run for reelection in his congressional district, he failed to qualify for his district's Republican primary after the {{majority}} of his petitions were declared fraudulent. An investigation of the campaign by the office of the Michigan Attorney General ensued. McCotter argued that [...] "somebody either panicked <b>or</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> sabotage...

[...] Steve Kornacki suggested the fraud may have been related to the presidential campaign, if it [...] "caused him to take his eye off the ball on his House reelection," [...] but McCotter rejected this as an [...] "idiotic line of thinking." [...] He initially hoped to wage a write-in campaign, but decided against it, finding he could not run the campaign while cooperating with the investigation and serving the remainder of his term in Congress. A month later, he resigned from Congress, claiming this was needed to fully assist with the petition fraud investigation. The investigation found that in addition to the 2012 petitions, McCotter's Congressional reelection petitions from 2006, 2008, and 2010, also showed evidence of fraud. McCotter sued two aides accusing them of intentional sabotage. Eventually, four aides, including one who was sued, were charged and convicted of violations related to the fraud.|$|E
