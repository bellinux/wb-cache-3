40|$|The 1994 {{outburst}} <b>threshold</b> <b>limits</b> {{imposed on}} coal mines {{operating in the}} Bulli seam were lower than the conservative value proposed by Lama in 1991. Equally conservative is the DRI 900 method for outburst <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> determination. A number of mines have encountered areas {{where it has been}} difficult, if not impossible, to reduce the seam gas to below the prescribed <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> prior to the arrival of roadway development machinery, despite extensive inseam gas drainage. In such situations these mines can experience lengthy production delays or even loss of reserves. Several Bulli seam mines have completed reviews of their outburst risk management which led to increasing their <b>threshold</b> <b>limits.</b> These mines have been operating safely, without outburst, for some four years. The method of determining the outburst <b>threshold</b> <b>limits</b> applicable to non-Bulli seam coal mines also hold a high degree of conservatism which is discussed. The need for re-appraisal of the <b>threshold</b> <b>limits</b> undertaken is reported, based on the further data analysis. The process of gas desorption methodology and the optimum gas content is one particular aspect of this study as it has a clear influence on the established values of the recognised <b>threshold</b> <b>limits.</b> The study has demonstrated that there is justification to increase the operating <b>threshold</b> <b>limits</b> to values of 12 m 3 /t for 100 % CH 4 and 8 m 3 /t for 100 % CO 2. Research is continuing to include sample analysis from other Australian mines...|$|R

40|$|Since the 1930 s <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> {{values have}} been {{presented}} as an objectively established measure of US industrial safety. However, there have been important questions raised regarding the adequacy of these thresholds for protecting workers from silicosis. This paper explores the historical debates over silica <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> values and the intense political negotiation that accompanied their establishment. In the 1930 s and early 1940 s, a coalition of business, public health, insurance, and political interests formed {{in response to a}} widely perceived "silicosis crisis. " Part of the resulting program aimed at containing the crisis was the establishment of <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> values. Yet silicosis cases continued to be documented. By the 1960 s these cases had become the basis for a number of revisions to the thresholds. In the 1970 s, following a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommendation to lower the <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> value for silica and to eliminate sand as an abrasive in blasting, industry fought attempts to make the existing values more stringent. This paper traces the process by which <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> values became part of a compromise between the health of workers and the economic interests of industry...|$|R

40|$|Since {{outburst}} <b>threshold</b> <b>limits</b> {{were imposed}} on Bulli seam mines in 1994 {{the occurrence of}} coal and gas outburst incidents have virtually been eliminated from the Australian coal industry. With the reduction in incidents and therefore hazard to the industry {{there has been a}} corresponding drop in research effort in this area. Some mines have in recent years reviewed and raised <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> values and non-Bulli seam mines accept the method of <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> value determination introduced by GeoGAS, based upon the DRI 900 concept. Detailed analysis of gas desorption data from a variety of Australian coal mines, representing different coal seams with variable gas content, gas composition, rank, type, structure, etc., has been undertaken and the results indicate significant relationships which impact the accepted method of outburst threshold determination. The relationships are discussed and a new method of determining outburst <b>threshold</b> <b>limits,</b> applicable to non-Bulli seam mines is presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the set of {{regulations}} as regards to accounting and auditing within the Union, is primarily to ensure a high quality of the large public companies financial reporting and hence protect the capital market investors. As the set of regulations also applies to the small companies, these are burdened by administrative costs that are disproportionate. To increase the competitiveness of the European companies, the European council has stated that {{it is essential to}} reduce the companies’ administrative costs. The main principle is that all companies are under an obligation to statutory audit, however Member States may make audit exemptions for small companies. In 2006 Denmark adopted a law which states that small companies are exempted from the statutory audit. Britain has progressively, in line with the Fourth Corporation Directive´s <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> value, abolished the statutory audit for small companies. The ability for small companies in Sweden to be exempted from the statutory audit will probably come into force 1 st of November 2010.  The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare the simplified auditing regulations in Swedish law with Danish law and British law. The aim is further to explore the possible cost savings that may arise in association with the abolition of the statutory audit in Sweden and subsequently estimate what the savings would amount to if the Danish and British <b>threshold</b> <b>limited</b> value was applied instead of the values suggested by the Swedish government. The thesis is performed with help of a comparative part followed by an analyzing part.   The auditing regulations are very equal in the three mentioned states. The British <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> value is the highest followed by the Danish and Swedish. The savings would have amount to almost the double if the British <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> value was applied instead of the one suggested by the Swedish government. Also when applying the Danish <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> value the savings would have amount to more. Thus it has been found that the higher <b>threshold</b> <b>limit</b> value that applies, the more companies will be subject to the statutory audit exemption and hence the greater the savings will amount to...|$|R
