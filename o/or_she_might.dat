5|$|Though {{the witches}} do not {{deliberately}} tell Macbeth to kill King Duncan, {{they use a}} subtle form of temptation when they inform Macbeth that he is destined to be king. By placing this thought in his mind, they effectively guide him {{on the path to}} his own destruction. This follows the pattern of temptation attributed to the Devil in the contemporary imagination: the Devil was believed to be a thought in a person's mind, which he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> either indulge or reject. Macbeth indulges the temptation, while Banquo rejects it.|$|E
5|$|Johnson and Christie set up {{separate}} departments {{for practical}} sciences, such as mathematics, natural history, agriculture, and medicine; literature, such as poetry, drama, and romance; and finally, politics and religion, which encompassed government, theology, philosophy, morality, law, and trade. For each department, {{there was a}} chief reviewer, although he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> engage others. Although the reviewers' names were not known to the public, Johnson and Christie managed to acquire several luminaries: the poet William Cowper; the popular moralist William Enfield; the writer and physician John Aikin; the poet, essayist, and children's author Anna Laetitia Barbauld; the Unitarian minister William Turner; the physician and literary critic James Currie; the artist Henry Fuseli; the writer Mary Hays; the scholar Alexander Geddes; and the theologian Joshua Toulmin. The reviewers were all paid, however scholars {{have been unable to}} discover their rates. Christie was often absent after the founding of the Analytical Review, leaving the day-to-day operations of the journal up to Johnson. In 1790 he went to Paris for six months, during which he met with revolutionary leaders and started a business; in 1792 he returned to help the French translate their constitution and to dissolve his business. He left for Surinam in 1796 to collect money owed to him, and died there.|$|E

25|$|The study The Evolution of the Human Breast (2001) {{proposed}} that the rounded shape of a woman's breast evolved to prevent the sucking infant offspring from suffocating while feeding at the teat; that is, because of the human infant's small jaw, which did not project from the face to reach the nipple, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> block the nostrils against the mother's breast if it were of a flatter form (cf. chimpanzee). Theoretically, as the human jaw receded into the face, the woman's body compensated with round breasts.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} sets of competencies for different specializations within I/O psychology and I/O psychologists are versatile behavioral scientists. For example, an I/O psychologist specializing in selection and recruiting should have expertise in finding the best talent for the organization and getting everyone on board while he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not need to know much about executive coaching. Some I/O psychologists specialize in specific areas of consulting whereas others tend to generalize their areas of expertise. There are basic skills and knowledge an individual needs {{in order to be}} an effective I/O psychologist, which include being an independent learner, interpersonal skills (e.g., listening skills), and general consultation skills (e.g., skills and knowledge in the problem area).|$|E
25|$|In operant conditioning, {{the type}} and {{frequency}} of behavior is determined mainly by its consequences. If a certain behavior, {{in the presence of}} a certain stimulus, is followed by a desirable consequence (a reinforcer), the emitted behavior will increase in frequency in the future, in the presence of the stimulus that preceded the behavior (or a similar one). Conversely, if the behavior is followed by something undesirable (a punisher), the behavior is less likely to occur in the presence of the stimulus. In a similar manner, removal of a stimulus directly following the behavior might either increase or decrease the frequency of that behavior in the future (negative reinforcement or punishment). For instance, a student that gained praise and a good grade after turning in a paper, might seem more motivated in writing papers in the future (positive reinforcement); if the same student put in a lot of work on a task without getting any praise for it, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> seem less motivated to do school work in the future (negative punishment). If a student starts to cause trouble in class gets punished with something he or she dislikes, such as detention (positive punishment), that behavior would decrease in the future. The student might seem more motivated to behave in class, presumably in order to avoid further detention (negative reinforcement).|$|E

500|$|In 1997, Morrison {{released}} The Healing Game. The album received mixed reviews, {{with the}} lyrics being described as [...] "tired" [...] and [...] "dull", though critic Greil Marcus praised the musical {{complexity of the}} album by saying: [...] "It carries the listener into a musical home so perfect and complete he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have forgotten that music could call up such a place, and then populate it with people, acts, wishes, fears." [...] The following year, Morrison finally released some of his previously unissued studio recordings in a two-disc set, The Philosopher's Stone. His next release, 1999's Back on Top, achieved a modest success, being his highest charting album in the US since 1978's Wavelength.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} quote is from 1955, spoken {{during the}} time of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the latest is from a sermon King delivered at the National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., four days before he was assassinated. The quotes are not arranged in chronological order, so that no visitor must follow a [...] "defined path" [...] to follow the quotations, instead being able to start reading at any point he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> choose. [...] Because the main theme of the Memorial is linked to King's famous [...] "I Have a Dream" [...] speech, none of the quotations on the Inscription Wall come from that speech.|$|E
2500|$|In {{mathematical}} psychology, antimatroids {{have been}} used to describe feasible states of knowledge of a human learner. Each element of the antimatroid represents a concept that is to be understood by the learner, or a class of problems that he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be able to solve correctly, and the sets of elements that form the antimatroid represent possible sets of concepts that could be understood by a single person. The axioms defining an antimatroid may be phrased informally as stating that learning one concept can never prevent the learner from learning another concept, and that any feasible state of knowledge can be reached by learning a single concept at a time. The task of a knowledge assessment system is to infer the set of concepts known by a given learner by analyzing his or her responses to a small and well-chosen set of problems. In this context antimatroids have also been called [...] "learning spaces" [...] and [...] "well-graded knowledge spaces".|$|E

2500|$|Techniques {{to promote}} {{lactation}} use frequent attempts to breastfeed, extensive skin-to-skin {{contact with the}} baby, and frequent, long pumping sessions. Suckling may be encouraged with a tube filled with infant formula, so that the baby associates suckling at the breast with food. A dropper or syringe without the needle {{may be used to}} place milk onto the breast while the baby suckles. [...] The mother should allow the infant to suckle at least ten times during 24 hours, and more times {{if he or she is}} interested. [...] These times can include every two hours, whenever the baby seems interested, longer at each breast, and when the baby is sleepy when he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> suckle more readily. [...] In keeping with increasing contact between mother and child, including increasing skin-to-skin contact, grandmothers should pull back and help in other ways. [...] Later on, grandmothers can again provide more direct care for the infant.|$|E
2500|$|The PayPal Buyer Protection Policy {{states that}} the {{customer}} may file a buyer complaint {{if he or she}} did not receive an item or if the item he or she purchased was significantly not as described. The customer can open a dispute within 180 days (for registered UK residents 180 days, changed 14 June 2014) from the date of payment and escalate it to a claim within 20 days from opening the dispute. [...] If the buyer used a credit card, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> get a refund via chargeback from his or her credit-card company. However, in the UK, where such a purchaser is entitled to specific statutory protections (that the credit card company is a second party to the purchase and is therefore equally liable in law if the other party defaults or goes into liquidation) under Section 75 Consumer Credit Act 1979, the purchaser loses this legal protection if the card payment is processed via PayPal.|$|E
2500|$|Beauvoir {{describes}} a woman's clothes, her girl friends and her relationships with men. She writes that [...] "marriage, by frustrating women's erotic satisfaction, denies them {{the freedom and}} individuality of their feelings, drives them to adultery". Beauvoir describes prostitutes and their relationships with pimps and with other women, as well as hetaeras. In contrast to prostitutes, hetaeras can gain recognition as an individual and if successful can aim higher and be publicly distinguished. Beauvoir writes that women's path to menopause might arouse woman's homosexual feelings (which Beauvoir thinks are latent in most women). When she agrees to grow old she becomes elderly with half of her adult life left to live. Woman might choose to live through her children (often her son) or her grandchildren but she faces [...] "solitude, regret, and ennui". To pass her time she might engage in useless [...] "women's handiwork", watercolors, music or reading, <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> join charitable organizations. While a few rare women are committed to a cause and have an end in mind, Beauvoir concludes that [...] "the highest form of freedom a woman-parasite can have is stoic defiance or skeptical irony".|$|E

2500|$|The {{new service}} plan was {{designed}} to redistribute Queens-bound passenger loads along the heavily used IND Sixth Avenue Line by encouraging use of the additional local trains provided for shorter trips, and to improve service and transfer opportunities for passengers using local stations along Queens Boulevard. The New York Times described the service plan as [...] "complex and heavily criticized." [...] New York Times columnist Randy Kennedy wrote that four months after it opened, the service was operating at only 49% of capacity. However, ridership had [...] "increased 30 percent since it began, and every new V rider, as lonely as he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be, relieves crowding on the [...]" [...] Several years experience with the service running, has shown its value and seen further gains. V trains, while by no means consistently full, have taken some load off the [...] train; however, some riders have complained that the passenger load on the [...] train has worsened, while others said it has gotten better, due to its becoming the only express train that runs along 53rd Street. The overcrowding on the E train was, in part, due to riders' propensity to board an express even in situations where it offers no real advantage in travel time over the local.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{one of the}} {{international}} alpine skiing classifiers was Mirre Kipfer. [...] She said [...] "Sometimes athletes try to cheat, to hide what they can really do. [...] They are athletes {{who want to be}} in a class [...] that is more advantageous to for them. [...] In testing and classification they don't show what they can really do. [...] They try to show that they are not able to do some movement, and that is why we have started functional testing." [...] She goes on to say [...] "The second problem is that when you have a very good athlete who is very well trained in the sport, you don't want to punish that person for their good performance. [...] He <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be an elite athlete doing a very good sport performance, and you might be tempted to say 'OK, he is doing so well he must be in another class.' We do try to get fewer classes so that we don't get, for example, 10 or 12 gold medals in alpine sports. [...] We try to review the classes, but you always have borderline classes and it is always difficult. [...] In winter the aim is to have three classes, like sitting, standing and blind: that is certainly the future that we are all looking to." ...|$|E
