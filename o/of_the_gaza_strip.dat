5|$|In 2000, the Second Intifada (also called al-Aqsa Intifada) began, and Israel built a {{separation}} barrier.

50|$|Although mixed bathing is commonplace today, it was {{not always}} the case, and it {{continues}} to be illegal or contentious in some parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world. In Muslim countries which are re-imposing sharia law, mixed bathing is being banned. For example, after Hamas took over <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> it closed down the Crazy Water Park, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip's</b> most popular entertainment sites, for allowing mixed bathing. Strict Orthodox Jews, Muslims and fundamentalist Christians in the Southern United States (e.g., Southwide Baptist Fellowship and Outward holiness) do not engage in mixed bathing. Many countries have anti-sex discrimination legislation which extend to <b>the</b> provision <b>of</b> sporting and recreational facilities, including private facilities. However, there are usually provisions for exemptions being granted, and exemptions have been granted in some cases for women-only bathing on the basis, for example, of religious and cultural sensitivities.|$|R
5|$|In March 2008, a {{coalition}} of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that Israeli air strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip.</b> In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians {{were killed in the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Gaza depends on groundwater {{as the only}} source for drinking, agricultural use, and domestic supply. The nearest stream is Wadi Ghazza to the south, sourced from Abu Middein along the coastline. It bears {{a small amount of}} water during the winter and virtually no water during the summer. Most of its water supply is diverted into Israel. The Gaza Aquifer along the coast is the main aquifer in the Gaza Strip and it consists mostly of Pleistocene sandstones. Like most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gaza</b> <b>Strip,</b> Gaza is covered by quaternary soil; clay minerals in the soil absorb many organic and inorganic chemicals which has partially alleviated the extent of groundwater contamination.|$|E
