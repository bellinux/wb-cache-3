Bigdata includes data from email, documents, pictures, audio, video files, and other sources that do not fit into a relational database. This unstructured data brings enormous challenges to Bigdata. The process of research into massive amounts of data to reveal hidden patterns and secret correlations named as big data analytics. Therefore, big data implementations need to be analyzed and executed as accurately as possible.

We performed a user study comparing our framework to two common 3 D selection techniques, Bendcast and Expand.

30|$|A feature-based {{approach}} for spectrum sensing based on periodic non-uniform sampling is addressed. In particular, the compressed-sampling version of detecting predetermined spectral shapes in sparse wideband regimes is faced {{by means of}} a correlation-matching procedure. The main contribution of the new sub-Nyquist sampling approach is that it allows to alleviate the amount of data needed in the spectrum sensing process. Once the sampling bottleneck is solved, the data autocorrelation matrix is obtained from sub-Nyquist samples. Following the correlation matching concept, the method is able to provide an estimate of the frequency location and a power level estimation of the desired user. Three different methods are proposed: The first one, which is based on the Euclidean distance, is discarded because of its low rejection to interference. The second one, which is based on the geodesic distance, works well in terms of interference rejection but the power level estimate that this method provides does not depend on the frequency parameter and therefore, it is not indicated when detecting more than one desired user. The third method, which is based on the positive semidefinite difference between matrices, is the <b>one</b> <b>which</b> <b>works</b> the better, both in terms of accuracy of the estimated parameters and in terms of robustness against noise. As it was expected, simulation results have shown that the compression affects the detection capabilities of all the correlation-matching methods. However, we have also shown that the accuracy of the frequency estimation and the accuracy of the power level estimation is not affected by the undersampling technique.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A black-box {{secret sharing}} scheme for the {{threshold}} access structure Tt,n is <b>one</b> <b>which</b> <b>works</b> over any finite Abelian group G. Briefly, such a scheme differs from an ordinary linear secret sharing scheme (over, say, a given finite field) in that distribution matrix and reconstruction vectors are defined over Z and are designed {{independently of the}} group G from which the secret and the shares are sampled. This means that perfect completeness and perfect privacy are guaranteed regardless of which group G is chosen. We define the black-box secret sharing problem as the problem of devising, for an arbitrary given Tt,n, a scheme with minimal expansion factor, i. e., where {{the length of the}} full vector of shares divided by the number of players n is minimal. Such schemes are relevant for instance in the context of distributed cryptosystems based on groups with secret or hard to compute group order. A recent example is secure general multi-party computation over black-box rings. In 1994 Desmedt and Frankel have proposed an elegant approach to the black-box secret sharing problem based in part on polynomial interpolation over cyclotomic number fields. For arbitrary given Tt,n with 0 < t < n − 1, the expansion factor of their scheme is O(n). This is the best previous general approach to the problem. Using certain low degree integral extensions of Z over which there exist pairs of sufficiently large Vandermonde matrices with co-prime determinants, we construct, for arbitrary given Tt,n with 0 < t < n − 1, a black-box secret sharing scheme with expansion factor O(log n), which we show is minimal. ...|$|E

This approach has old roots, but its current success born in the last years due to two phenomenon’s; the great crisis in traditional governance in particular in western societies from 70 ’s until nowadays, and the inadequate local answers to this problems. On one hand some governments try to solve it with more restrict places of power, that take decisions on their own, on the other hand or they try to solve it with naïve participation, open new moments of decision without specific methods, thinking that differences could be solve with “good will” and  voting. (From the introduction“Confronto Creativo; dal diritto alla parola al diritto di essere ascoltati” Lawrence Susskind- Marianella Sclavi 2011) On September 2011 Lawrence Susskind came to Italy in order to presents his book “Confronto Creativo, dal diritto di parola al diritto di essere ascoltati”, wrote with Marianella Sclavi.

S has a bidegree, (a,b), where a {{is the number}} of lines of S through a general point in P 3 and b {{is the number of}} lines of S contained in a general plane of P 3. Let g be the sectional genus of S. Then one would like to know a function B(a,b,s), such that g≤B(a,b,s) whenever S is not contained in a hypersurface of degree <s. E. Arrondo and I. Sols Lucía [Mém. Soc. Math. France (N. S.) No. 50 (1992), 96 pp. ] have produced a bound g≤B ′ (a+b,s), where s is the minimal degree of a hypersurface containing S, but their bound only depends on the total degree, a+b, of the surface. If a and b are different, one might expect to get a better bound. One such bound is a classical <b>one</b> <b>which</b> <b>works</b> provided a is quite small compared to b, s= 2 (S is not contained in a hyperplane section of Gr(1,P 3)) and the triadic locus of S is of dimension ≤ 2 [see M.

The paper under review provides two functions, B 1 (a,b,s) and B 2 (a+b,s), which bound the genus of S if S is not contained in a hypersurface of degree <s. B 1 gives a better bound than the Arrondo and Sols bound and the classical bound when a is close to b, but when a and b are far apart, it is not as strong as the classical bound. The method of proof is based on the analysis of characters of sets of points in the plane. ...|$|E

The automatic analysis is highly useful in analyzing player performance, computer assisted referee and tactics inference. In this thesis, we have proposed distinct methods to capture the ball movements there by ending which team has the control on the ball for most of the time. Distinct methods mean different methods for detection, tracking and to find the control. In the detection to identify the location of the ball, we have proposed a 9 step method. We have to execute these steps one by one. These steps include played detection, edge detection, moving object detection, conjunction, morphology, shape strainer, size sieve, dominant color extraction, neighborhood detection. These steps are mainly based on attributes of the ball. These attributes include color, shape, and size. The moving object detection step work based on the optical ow of the ball. In the tracking phase, we will select a region of interest in which we will nd the most probable location of the ball by maximizing the likelihood of multiplication of color histogram of location and ball. After finding the most probable location, we localize the ball in the region by mean shift tracking method. The mean shift tracking algorithm is the <b>one</b> <b>which</b> <b>works</b> base on weights derived from Bhattacharyya coecient to delineate the ball or target. Bhattacharyya coecient is naturally used to nd the similarity between two statistical samples by considering their probability distributions.

40|$|PRESIDENT'S REPORT QUOTA INTERNATIONAL OF YOUNGSTOWN June 1, 1994 -May 31, 1995 This {{has been}} a year of change for the club. We started the year with enthusiasm and optimism. We were to be the host club for the Sixth District Conference, Sept. 23 rd, 24 th, 25 th, 1994. The {{preparations}} for the conference should have involved all of the members and have a unifying effect on the club. Instead the conference was a negative influence. Some members {{felt that they were}} excluded from the preparations and were unaware of the plans for the conference. When questions were raised during the meetings, the conference chairman seemed to feel that her authority was being questioned. At one meeting, she stated that all preparations were on a need to know basis, and members would be informed when their help was needed. Although the club did have dissension previously, the conference should have been the opportunity for the members to work together and rebuild the camaraderie and fellowship for which Quota is known. The conference was considered to be a success by others, and seemed to run smoothly on the surface; the problems were noticeable to the members and those who looked closely. Following the conference, the club suffered a major loss of membership. When the year began, we had a membership of 43, which included 26 active and 17 affiliate. A new club was chartered in our area in November 1994. Thirteen of our members resigned to become charter members of the new club. This included the President, two Vice Presidents, and three Directors At this time, as a Past President and current Treasurer, I assumed the Presidency. We had to appoint almost a whole new Board. In addition, we had four others resign for various reasons. We now have a membership of twenty-six, which includes 10 active and 16 affiliates. The remaining members felt deserted and betrayed by the method used to charter the new club on the basis of 13 members of our club. They felt deserted and abandoned by the resigning members. Our club had been instrumental in the chartering of the Trumbull Valley club and would have supported efforts to charter a new club in Trumbull county. They feel that the Northeast club was organized in secret and created to be in direct competition with the Youngstown club, both for membership and in fund raising. These feelings have not been helped by the actions of the new club, which holds it's meetings and fund raising in the city of Youngstown. The members of the Youngstown club have now reach the point where they are beginning to move forward again. We are planning a membership recruitment drive in May 1995 and are exploring new service projects related to the new International service area of destitute women and children. A fund raiser has been tentatively planned for the fall. This club is not ready to give up, but will face the challenge of rebuilding. TO: President Donna Primm, President Quota International of Youngstown,Ohio FROM: Speech and Hearing Committee Elaine Garde (Chairperson), Grace Jones, Dorothy Klein DATE: April 3, 1995 1.) COLLECTOR DOLL RAFFLE: The original Committee voted on having a raffle of the Marie Osmond collector doll in order to raise funds for the Stambaugh Auditorium project. At Sixth District Conference several other Club were using the same doll for similar reasons. There were not sufficient moneys earned at Conference to justify holding the raffle. After the Conference, internal problems related to the loss of membership and the chartering of a new club in the area, resulted in the need to cancel the raffle. The doll can be used in the fall of 1996 if the new committee elects to use it as part of a fund raiser. If this project goes forward the tickets, which were not dated due a printing error, can be used by stamping the drawing date on to the tickets which were donated to the Club by Niles Printing. 2.) DEAF WOMAN OF THE YEAR: There was no nominee for the Deaf Woman of the Year from this Club. It is hoped that Quota International will be sucessfull in securing permission from the Miss America Pagent Committee to nominate the 1995 - 1996 Miss America as the International Deaf Woman of the Year. 3.) STAMBAUGH AUDITORIUM PROJECT: The Manager of the Stamb­augh Auditorium is in receipt of information on two different systems from two different companies. She is being asked to arrange a trial of both systems and will select the <b>one</b> <b>which</b> <b>works</b> the best with the auditorium sound system. Once the system is selected; plans to purchase the base unit will be made. How much we can spend, initially, will depend on the over-all cost. Expansion will depend on the audience response for additional units. At least $ 1000 will be spent initially. 4.) HEALTH-O-RAMA: We had a limited number of volunteers for this project in March. The help of the members who did volunteer is greatly appreciated. This year we had candy, purchased in bulk from Sam's Club, to give out in addition to the ear plugs and handouts. Emphasis is being placed, nation­ally, on preventing hearing loss in youth between the 3 rd. and 6 th. grades. Mothers were asked to speak out at PTA meetings - 2 ­requesting in-school programs and how to contact Quota Internat­ional of Youngstown, OH., for information on several programs. During International Convention we obtained information on new programs and free educational materials. These sources were contacted and the materials received used this year. A request to explore use of the educational materials has been received from the Lake to River Girl Scout Council for use as part of their "Earth Matters" program. The tapes from Health-O-Rama have been placed on loaned with the Council's Executive Director, Karen Yankush. A letter regarding the availability of these programs is being sent to the area Boy Scouts headquarters and to the Camp Fire Girls, as well. We ordered 8 boxes of ear plugs (1800) at $ 23 a box and rented a VCR for $ 49. 99. Handouts were copied at Kinko's for$ 28. 62. The charges for Health-O-Rama totaled $ 265. 36 We gave out over 1600 ear plugs this year; about 500 + over 1994. 4.) COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS: a. } Pursue the doll raffle for the coming year. Advertise and sell tickets in public places, like the Mallon Thanksgiving weekend, and indicate that the proceeds are going to the Stamb­augh Auditorium project. b.) Invite Sue Thomas, Youngstown's Deaf Woman of the Year, and 1986 Deaf Woman of the Year for the Sixth District, Jane Biehl, to membership in Quota International of Youngstown, OH. c.) Contact the Mahoning County, Youngstown, and Diocese of Youngstown Board of Education's {{before the end of the}} school year, using the promotional material of 1995, to invite partici­pation in the 1996 poster contest for Speech and Hearing month. d.) Attempt to locate a candidate for Deaf Woman of the Year unless International must wait 1 year before being able to use Miss America as a Deaf Woman of the Year. e. } Continue participation in Health-O-Rama, contact area music teachers and PTA groups regarding the educational programs for 3 rd. through 6 th. graders, and continue to promote our noise pollution programs throughout the Valley. f.) Stambaugh Project will need re-evaluation with the - 3 ­help of the Auditorium manager to determine how many additional personal unit will be needed.
