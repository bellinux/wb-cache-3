40|$|Previous {{research}} has usually assumed full execution of warranty if a product fails within <b>the</b> <b>warranty</b> time. This paper investigates <b>the</b> effect of <b>warranty</b> execution on <b>the</b> expected <b>warranty</b> reserves of a linear pro rata rebate plan.

40|$|Due to {{a growing}} demand for the {{second-hand}} product, especially for the expensive one, <b>the</b> <b>warranty</b> and maintenance policies for such products have been studied to improve the product reliability of late. In this paper we study a periodic maintenance model for the second-hand product which is purchased by the customer {{at the age of}} x. When purchased, the dealer provides a warranty of a xed length during which the product is maintained periodically to reduce the failure rate of the product and thus, to improve the reliability after each maintenance is served. If a failure occurs between two successive maintenances, only minimal repair is conducted. As for <b>the</b> <b>warranty</b> policy, we adopt free non-renewing repair action on each failure, in addition to the periodic maintenance service during <b>the</b> <b>warranty</b> period. Thus, under <b>the</b> given <b>warranty</b> policy, all <b>the</b> maintenance and repair costs incurred during <b>the</b> <b>warranty</b> period are charged to the dealer. For the proposed periodic maintenance scheme, we formulate a cost model to evaluate the expected total cost charged to the dealer during <b>the</b> <b>warranty</b> period and derive an optimal upgrade level of the failure rate at each maintenance to minimize <b>the</b> expected total <b>warranty</b> cost from <b>the</b> perspective of the dealer...|$|R

The cost of the ith minimal repair at age y depends on the random part C(y) and the deterministic part, ci(y).
