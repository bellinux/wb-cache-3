Recently, several new gravity models have been produced using the latest lunar satellites tracking data, such as LP 165 P, SGM 150 J, GL 0900 D and GRGM 900 C. In this paper, the four gravity models mentioned above were evaluated through the power spectra analysis, admittance and coherence analysis. Effect of four lunar gravity models on Chang'E- 2 orbit determination performance is investigated and assessed using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) tracking data. The overlap orbit analysis, the posteriori data residual, and the <b>orbit</b> <b>prediction</b> are used to evaluate the orbit precision between successive arcs.

The results show that the reduction in accuracy is not extensive and good orbit predictions are still possible when using only 5 s of data from the beginning of each pass.

40|$|The avaiability of GPS {{receivers}} for spaceborne applications {{has opened}} new prospects for satellite orbit determination {{over the past}} decade. In combination with a Kalman filter, accurate estimates of the spacecraft position and velocity can be obtained in real-time onboard the space vehicle. Traditionally, numerical methods of varying complexity are applied for propagating the state vector between measurements and updates of the state vector are referred to the epoch of the latest measurement. This approach is well- suited for applications requiring instataneous state estimates (e. g. sensor pointing or geocoding of images), but cannot easily be applied for onboard mission planning purposes (resource allocation, eclipse prediction, station contact forecast, etc.) that require <b>orbit</b> <b>predictions.</b> A different concept has therefore been developed, which offers increased onboard autonomy and is particularly promising for smal satellites eith moderate accuracy requirements. Here, an analytical orbit model is {{used to describe the}} spacecraft trajectory and mean epoch elements are estimated instead of the instantaneous, osculating state vector. Making use of the SGP 4 orbit model that is compatible with NORAD twoline elements, an epoch state Kalman filter has been implemented and tested with GPS flight data of GPS/MET and SAC-A. It is demonstrated that the proposed method provides accuracies compatible with that of the analytical model and is robust enough to handle large data gaps in case of limited onboard resources for GPS operations. By adjusting the ballistic coefficient along with the mean epoch elements, a considerable improvement of mid-term <b>orbit</b> <b>predictions</b> is achieved over methods that are restricted to the estimation of the state vector alone...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{consider}} methods of spectral analysis and deep learning to improve accuracy {{and quality of}} GNSS satellite orbit predictions. The quality of predictions decreases when satellite’s orbit is fixed with maneuvers, which causes satellite orbit predictions to fail. In our previous research orbit accuracy has been improved using analytical and data-driven models. The goal {{of this study is}} to improve quality of BeiDou satellite predictions with spectral analysis and to improve accuracy of GNSS satellite orbit predictions with deep learning. Both methods are used to improve the existing model for satellite orbit predictions. The improvement in quality is done by predicting unhealthy time periods of BeiDou’s GEO and IGSO satellites. Periodogram was used to estimate a period of health parameter from broadcast. The improvement in accuracy was done with convolutional neural networks. The convolutional neural network was used to predict RTN errors of existing models orbit predictions. The errors were predited from RTN errors from the beginning of the <b>orbit</b> <b>prediction.</b> With these error predictions the predicted orbit can be corrected. The main results of this study were that unhealthy periods can be predicted from the broadcast data and even a simple convolutional neural network can improve <b>orbit</b> <b>prediction</b> accuracy significantly. Health prediction algorithm could be created from the estimated periods to predict health successfully. Health prediction worked with BeiDou’s GEO and IGSO satellites and predicted over 70 % of unhealthy periods in testing.

40|$|The {{real-time}} GNSS {{applications are}} of increasing interest. The Precise Point Positioning tech-nique (Zumberge, 1997) applied in real-time requires dissemination of the precise satellite orbits and clocks with high eciency and unique reproducibility. Because {{of the rapid}} variation of the satellite clock corrections, the prediction could not be provided for a period longer than a few tens of minutes. The clock corrections should be thus better estimated in real-time. On contrary, the orbit dynamical models are, in most cases, good sucient even for a long-arc (few days) representation with a few centimeters accuracy in the position today.

40|$|A {{population}} of deep space objects {{is thought to}} be high area-to-mass ratio (AMR) debris having origins from sources in the geosynchronous orbit (GEO) belt. The typical AMR values have been observed to range anywhere from 1 's to 10 's of m(sup 2) /kg, and hence, higher than average solar radiation pressure effects result in long-term migration of eccentricity (0. 1 - 0. 6) and inclination over time. However, the nature of the debris orientation-dependent dynamics also results time-varying solar radiation forces about the average which complicate the short-term orbit determination processing. The orbit determination results are presented for several of these debris objects, and highlight their unique and varied dynamic attributes.
