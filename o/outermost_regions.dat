5|$|The {{migration}} {{of the outer}} planets is also necessary {{to account for the}} existence and properties of the Solar System's <b>outermost</b> <b>regions.</b> Beyond Neptune, the Solar System continues into the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc, and the Oort cloud, three sparse populations of small icy bodies thought to be the points of origin for most observed comets. At their distance from the Sun, accretion was too slow to allow planets to form before the solar nebula dispersed, and thus the initial disc lacked enough mass density to consolidate into a planet. The Kuiper belt lies between 30 and 55AU from the Sun, while the farther scattered disc extends to over 100AU, and the distant Oort cloud begins at about 50,000AU. Originally, however, the Kuiper belt was much denser and closer to the Sun, with an outer edge at approximately 30AU. Its inner edge would have been just beyond the orbits of Uranus and Neptune, which were in turn far closer to the Sun when they formed (most likely in the range of 15–20AU), and in 50% of simulations ended up opposite locations, with Uranus farther from the Sun than Neptune.|$|E

25|$|Seven <b>outermost</b> <b>regions</b> were {{recognised}} at {{the signing}} of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. The Treaty of Lisbon included two additional territories (Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin) in 2007, both of which seceded from one of the original <b>outermost</b> <b>regions</b> (Guadeloupe). Saint Barthélemy changed its status from OMR to OCT with effect from 1 January 2012. Mayotte, which was formerly an OCT, joined the EU as a OMR with effect from 1 January 2014. As of April 2014, a total of nine territories (six French, two Portuguese, and one Spanish) were registered to have OMR status.|$|E

25|$|On 22 February 2007, Saint Barthélemy and Saint Martin were {{separated}} from the French overseas department of Guadeloupe to form new overseas collectivities.

25|$|While ellipticals and spirals {{tend to have}} {{somewhat}} well-defined Sérsic profiles, {{the surface}} brightness profiles of lenticular galaxies are often more difficult to quantify. The disk component of lenticular galaxies often has a very flat surface brightness distribution (Sérsic index of n ≈ 1), especially in the <b>outermost</b> <b>regions</b> of the disk. Also, there is typically an observed truncation in the surface brightness of lenticular galaxies at ~ 4 scale radii of the disk. These features {{are consistent with the}} general structure of spiral galaxies. However, the bulge component of lenticulars is more closely related to elliptical galaxies in terms of morphological classification. This spheroidal region, which dominates the overall structure of lenticular galaxies, has a much steeper surface brightness profile (Sérsic index of n ≈ 4, or that of a de Vaucouleurs profile) than the disk component. Since the bulge component tends to dominate the galaxy, lenticular galaxy samples are often indistinguishable from elliptical galaxy populations in terms of their overall surface brightness profiles. However, galaxies are often assigned the S0 morphological class when they require multiple Sérsic indices to describe their surface brightness profiles, one to describe the bulge and one to describe the disk. This implies that lenticular galaxies are a distinct morphological subclass of galaxies.|$|E

500|$|Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's {{atmosphere}} is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, but {{it contains a}} higher proportion of [...] "ices" [...] such as water, ammonia, and methane.

500|$|Although the {{boundaries}} {{may be somewhat}} vague, Saturn's moons {{can be divided into}} ten groups according to their orbital characteristics. Many of them, such as Pan and Daphnis, orbit within Saturn's ring system and have orbital periods only slightly longer than the planet's rotation period. [...] The innermost moons and most regular satellites all have mean orbital inclinations ranging from less than a degree to about 1.5 degrees (except Iapetus, which has an inclination of 7.57 degrees) and small orbital eccentricities. [...] On the other hand, irregular satellites in the <b>outermost</b> <b>regions</b> of Saturn's moon system, in particular the Norse group, have orbital radii of millions of kilometers and orbital periods lasting several years. The moons of the Norse group also orbit in the opposite direction to Saturn's rotation.|$|E

The rest owe their status to European Union legislative provisions which exclude the territories from the application of the legislation concerned.
