5|$|Dušan put Syrgiannes at {{the head}} of a large Serbian force, with which he invaded Byzantine Macedonia in 1334. Syrgiannes's {{abilities}} as a general, his knowledge of the Byzantine army's dispositions and the friendships he had maintained with several local Byzantine officers resulted in the swift capture of many important Byzantine cities, including Ohrid, Prilep, Strumica, and Kastoria. The road was open for an advance towards Thessalonica, and Syrgiannes's army encamped before the walls of the city, facing a Byzantine relief force. Both sides remained encamped confronting each other for several days, but on 23 August 1334, Syrgiannes was lured away from his camp with only a few retainers and murdered by Sphrantzes Palaiologos, a Byzantine general who had defected <b>on</b> <b>purpose</b> to the Serbian camp a few days earlier. With the loss of their principal military leader, the Serbs settled for a negotiated peace with the Byzantines, which was very advantageous for them as they were left in possession of most of the cities won by Syrgiannes in northern Macedonia.|$|E

5|$|Hughes {{was killed}} in action {{on the evening of}} 7September 1940, after he intercepted a Dornier Do17 bomber taking part in a {{large-scale}} attack on London. His Spitfire crashed in a field between Sundridge and Bessels Green in Kent. He apparently bailed out, but his parachute failed to open; his body was found in a garden on Main Road, Sundridge, not far from the wreck of his Spitfire. The Dornier came down in the River Darent. No.234 Squadron lost its commanding officer, O'Brien, in the same action. Mystery surrounds exactly how Hughes came to grief, though his close-in tactics are believed to have played a major part in it. The strain of regular combat without respite, manifesting itself in fatigue and spots before the eyes, may also have contributed. He is generally thought to have collided with flying wreckage from the crippled German bomber, rendering his Spitfire uncontrollable. It is also possible that Hughes accidentally rammed his target. Further speculation suggested that he was the victim of friendly fire from another British fighter attacking the same Dornier, or was struck by German bullets from a Bf109. Some observers on the ground, including collier Charles Hall, maintained that Hughes rammed the Dornier <b>on</b> <b>purpose.</b> Four days after his death, No.234 Squadron was moved back to the relative quiet of Cornwall.|$|E
