50|$|The {{equivalent}} {{ability and}} safety of plant <b>sterols</b> and plant <b>stanols</b> to lower cholesterol {{continues to be a}} hotly debated topic. Plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols,</b> when compared head to head in clinical trials, have been shown to equally reduce cholesterol levels. A meta-analysis of 14 randomized, controlled trials comparing plant <b>sterols</b> to plant <b>stanols</b> directly at doses of 0.6 to 2.5 g/day showed no difference between the two forms on total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglyceride levels. Trials looking at high doses (> 4 g/day) of plant <b>sterols</b> or <b>stanols</b> are very limited, and none have yet to be completed comparing the same high dose of plant <b>sterol</b> to plant <b>stanol.</b>|$|R
40|$|High serum LDL {{cholesterol}} {{concentration is}} a major risk factor for cardiovascular complications. This risk can be lowered by diet. In this respect foods containing plant <b>sterol</b> or <b>stanol</b> esters can be useful for mildly- and hypercholesteraemic subjects. Plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols,</b> which are structurally related to cholesterol, decrease the incorporation of dietary and biliary cholesterol into micelles. This lowers cholesterol absorption. Furthermore, these components increase ABC-transporter expression, which may {{also contribute to the}} decreased cholesterol absorption. Consequently, cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor activity increase, which ultimately leads to decreased serum LDL cholesterol concentrations. Animal studies have further shown that these dietary components may also lower atherosclerotic lesion development. Plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> also lower plasma lipid-standardized concentrations of the hydrocarbon carotenoids, but not those of the oxygenated cartenoids and tocopherols. Also, vitamin A and D concentrations are not affected. Although absorption of plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> (0. 02 - 3. 5 %) is low compared to cholesterol (35 - 70 %), small amounts are found in the circulation and may influence other physiological functions. However, there is no consistent evidence that plant <b>sterols</b> or <b>stanols</b> can change the risk of colon or prostate cancer, or immune status. In conclusion, plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> effectively reduce serum LDL cholesterol and atherosclerotic risk. In addition potential effects of plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> on <b>other</b> metabolic processes remain to be elucidated. © 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} the impact of plant <b>sterols,</b> <b>stanols,</b> <b>sterol</b> esters, and <b>stanol</b> esters on (i) cholesterol-lowering efficiency, (ii) gene expression of ABCG 5 and ABCG 8 sterol transporters in the liver and small intestine, and (iii) colon mucosal cell proliferation in hamsters. After 5 weeks on experimental diets, plasma total cholesterol levels were reduced (P< 0. 05) by <b>stanols,</b> <b>sterol</b> esters and <b>stanol</b> esters compared to cholesterol-control diet. Different PS analogs did not alter ABCG 5 and ABCG 8 mRNA levels in small intestine and liver as compared to cholesterol control. In addition, colon mucosal cell proliferation was 21. 4 % lower (P< 0. 01) in group fed 0. 7 % stanol esters relative to cholesterol control. Results suggest that hypocholesterolemic effects of PS analogs are not associated with changes of liver and small intestine ABCG 5 and ABCG 8 sterol transporters.

40|$|Phytosterols (PS, {{comprising}} plant <b>sterols</b> {{and plant}} <b>stanols)</b> {{have been proven}} to lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations. The dose–response relationship for this effect has been evaluated in several meta-analyses by calculating averages for different dose ranges or by applying continuous dose–response functions. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. So far, the calculation of averages for different dose ranges has not been done for plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> separately. The objective of the present meta-analysis {{was to investigate the}} combined and separate effects of plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> when classified into different dose ranges. Studies were searched and selected based on predefined criteria. Relevant data were extracted. Average LDL-cholesterol effects were calculated when studies were categorised by dose, according to random-effects models while using the variance as weighing factor. This was done for plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> combined and separately. In total, 124 studies (201 strata) were included. Plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> were administered in 129 and fifty-nine strata, respect-ively; the remaining used a mix of both. The average PS dose was 2 · 1 (range 0 · 2 – 9 · 0) g/d. PS intakes of 0 · 6 – 3 · 3 g/d were found to gradually reduce LDL-cholesterol concentrations by, on average, 6 – 12 %. When plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> were analysed separately, clear and comparable dose–response relationships were observed. Studies carried out with PS doses exceeding 4 g/d were not pooled, as these were scarce and scattered across a wide range of doses.

40|$|Dietary supplementation with plant <b>sterols,</b> <b>stanols,</b> {{and their}} esters reduces {{intestinal}} cholesterol absorption, thus lowering plasma LDL cholesterol concentration in humans. It was suggested that these beneficial effects are attributable {{in part to}} induction of genes involved in intestinal cholesterol transport, e. g., Abcg 5 and Abcg 8, via the liver X receptor (LXR), but direct proof is lacking. Male C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were fed a purified diet (control), diets containing cholesterol (0. 12 g/ 100 g) only, or in combination with either plant <b>sterols</b> or <b>stanols</b> (0. 5 g/ 100 g) for 4 wk. Plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> dramatically increased neutral fecal sterol excretion (2. 2 and 1. 4 -fold, respectively, compared with cholesterol-fed mice; P < 0. 05). Cholesterol and cholesterol ester concentrations were higher in livers of mice fed cholesterol compared with controls (+ 135 % and + 925 %; P < 0. 05). Plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> completely prevented cholesterol accumulation as well as induction of LXR target genes in liver. Feeding plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> did not alter intestinal expression of Abcg 5, Abcg 8, or other LXR target genes nor of Npc 1 / 1. Fractional cholesterol absorption in Abcg 5 (-/-) mice was reduced {{to the same extent}} by dietary plant sterols (49 %) as in wild-type littermates (44 %). Plant sterol and stanol-induced reduction of cholesterol absorption in mice is not associated with upregulation of intestinal LXR target genes nor is it influenced by Abcg 5 -deficiency.

40|$|Research has {{demonstrated}} that plant <b>sterol</b> and <b>stanol</b> ester-enriched margarine spreads lower LDL cholesterol by 9 - 14 % (1). Maximal LDL reduction is achieved at plant <b>sterol</b> or <b>stanol</b> ester doses of 1. 6 - 2. 0 g/day (2, 3). The mechanism for LDL reduction is the inhibition of cholesterol absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. For patients following a low-fat diet, plant sterols provide LDL-lowering beyond that obtained through diet alone. Plant sterols also provide additional LDL-lowering when {{used in conjunction with}} statins (2, 4). Recent studies of esterified and non-esterified <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> in low-fat foods have demonstrated the same extent of LDL reduction observed with sterol ester-enriched fatty foods. Plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> appear safe, but are associated with decreased lycopene and carotene levels. However, these reductions can be prevented by consuming one additional serving/day of a high-carotenoid food (5). Despite demonstrated effectiveness and safety, sales of phytosterol-enriched products have been slow. Future research is needed to develop better marketing strategies and to expand the number of phytosterol-enriched products.

40|$|Heart {{disease has}} been the number one killer of American men and women over the past hundred years, with high blood {{cholesterol}} as a major risk factor of this disease. High Cholesterol can {{be a result of}} a number of different lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise. However, genetics and family history also {{play a role in the}} levels of cholesterol in the human body. Those who have high blood cholesterol levels are usually advised by their health professionals to consume a diet low in saturated fats and cholesterol, high in fiber and to exercise frequently. However, sometimes these precautions are just not enough to lower cholesterol to healthy levels, thus supplemental measures need to be taken. Cholesterol lowering medicines and/or adding plant sterols to a diet is a good complementary measure to take in order to lower cholesterol in individuals. People consume plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> every day in the foods they eat, however the amount that they consume is often not great enough to provide significant blood-cholesterol lowering effects. My senior research project will involve studying the natural and healthy alternatives to lowering individuals’ blood-cholesterol through plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols.</b> Food technologies have allowed plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> to be naturally incorporated into many commercially modified foods (such as salad dressings, spreads, yogurts, juices, snack bars etc.).

40|$|Cereals are an {{important}} source of <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> in the human diet. The present study underlines the effect of genotype and weather conditions in bread wheat, on total <b>sterol</b> and <b>stanol</b> content (TSS), agronomic traits, proteins and ash content under organic conditions. Variations in TSS as well as other characters between two sowing dates were observed. A broad genotypic variability was also reported since extreme genotypes differed by more than 30 mg 100. g- 1 DW for TSS, with total stanol content varying twofold. Moreover, two groups of genotypes that differed in agronomic production, ash and protein content were depicted, based on their response to an increase in temperature. This result suggests that the genotypic factor prevails over the sowing date factor for determining <b>sterol</b> and <b>stanol</b> traits in wheat cultivated under organic conditions. Nevertheless, a strong interaction exists between the two factors, which can be used to drive bioaccumulation of these molecules...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{animal and}} human {{studies have shown}} that plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols,</b> which are used as {{functional}} food ingredients to lower increased LDL cholesterol concentrations, pass the blood-brain barrier.

The aim {{of the present study was}} therefore to examine the effects of long-term plant <b>sterol</b> or <b>stanol</b> consumption on neurocognitive functioning and mood in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dietary intervention trial. To this end, hypercholesterolemic individuals, aged 43 - 69 y, receiving stable statin treatment were randomly assigned to an 85 -wk supplementation with margarines enriched with plant sterol esters (2. 5 g/d), plant stanol esters (2. 5 g/d), or placebo. At baseline and at the end of the intervention period, all participants underwent a cognitive assessment. In addition, subjective cognitive functioning and mood were assessed by means of questionnaires (Cognitive Failure Questionnaire and depression subscale of the Symptom Checklist 90, respectively). Long-term supplementation with plant <b>sterol</b> or <b>stanol</b> esters did not affect cognitive performance (memory, simple information processing speed, complex information processing speed, Letter-Digit Substitution test performance), subjective cognitive functioning, or mood.

40|$|Foods with plant <b>stanol</b> or <b>sterol</b> esters lower serum {{cholesterol}} levels. We {{summarize the}} deliberations of 32 {{experts on the}} efficacy and safety of <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols.</b> A meta-analysis of 41 trials showed that intake of 2 g/d of <b>stanols</b> or <b>sterols</b> reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by 10 %; higher intakes added little. Efficacy is similar for <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols,</b> but the food form may substantially affect LDL reduction. Effects are additive with diet or drug interventions: eating foods low in saturated fat and cholesterol and high in <b>stanols</b> or <b>sterols</b> can reduce LDL by 20 %; adding <b>sterols</b> or <b>stanols</b> to statin medication {{is more effective than}} doubling the statin dose. A meta-analysis of 10 to 15 trials per vitamin showed that plasma levels of vitamins A and D are not affected by <b>stanols</b> or <b>sterols.</b> Alpha carotene, lycopene, and vitamin E levels remained stable relative to their carrier molecule, LDL. Beta carotene levels declined, but adverse health outcomes were not expected. Sterol-enriched foods increased plasma sterol levels, and workshop participants discussed whether this would increase risk, in view of the marked increase of atherosclerosis in patients with homozygous phytosterolemia. This risk is believed to be largely hypothetical, and any increase due to the small increase in plasma plant sterols may be more than offset by the decrease in plasma LDL. There are insufficient data to suggest that plant <b>stanols</b> or <b>sterols</b> either prevent or promote colon carcinogenesis. Safety of <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> is being monitored by follow-up of samples from the general population; however, the power of such studies to pick up infrequent increases in common diseases, if any exist, is limited. A trial with clinical outcomes probably would not answer remaining questions about infrequent adverse effects. Trials with surrogate end points such as intima-media thickness might corroborate the expected efficacy in reducing atherosclerosis.

40|$|Intestinal {{absorption}} of plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> {{is much lower}} as {{compared with that of}} cholesterol; and therefore, serum concentrations are low. Circulating plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> are incorporated into tissues. However, hardly any data are available about tissue distributions of individual plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols,</b> particularly in relation to their serum concentrations. We therefore fed female apolipoprotein E* 3 -Leiden mice a control diet, a plant sterol-enriched diet (1 g/ 100 g diet), or a plant stanol-enriched diet (1 g/ 100 g diet) for 8 weeks. In the sterol group, serum cholesterol-standardized campesterol and sitosterol concentrations were, respectively, 8 and 7 times higher as compared with those in the control group. Consequently, the serum campesterol-sitosterol ratio remained essentially unchanged. Cholesterol-standardized plant sterol concentrations increased significantly in all analyzed tissues, except brain. However, the campesterol-sitosterol ratio also increased in all tissues (except in liver and spleen), suggesting that campesterol is preferentially incorporated over sitosterol in those tissues. For the stanol group, serum plant stanol concentrations also increased; but the increase was but less pronounced. We conclude that, in apolipoprotein E* 3 -Leiden mice, campesterol is preferentially incorporated into most tissues over sitosterol, which cannot be deduced from changes in serum concentrations. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

50|$|The debate {{regarding}} <b>sterol</b> vs. <b>stanol</b> {{safety is}} centered on their differing intestinal absorption and resulting plasma concentrations.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{ability of}} {{cholestanol}} to support growth of yeast sterol auxotrophs has been examined. Growth on this stanol was precluded unless minute quantities of ergosterol were available, a phenomenon designated sparking. The {{low levels of}} ergosterol were insufficient to support growth alone. The data indicate that cholestanol is fulfilling a bulk membrane requirement(s) while ergosterol satisfies a high specificity sparking function(s). A variety of <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> were analyzed {{for their ability to}} satisfy these two sterol functions in yeast sterol auxotrophs. While many <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> satisfied bulk membrane requirements, only those possessing a C- 5, 6 unsaturation or capable of being desaturated at C- 5 in vivo fulfilled the sparking function. Addition of a bromo or iodo moiety to the sterol side chain had no effect on the ability of cholesterol to satisfy either sterol function. However, the presence of a keto or hydroxy group on the sterol side chain completely abolished the ability of cholesterol to satisfy either sterol requirement. Unsaturation of the A-ring or a-saturation of a C- 5, 6 unsaturation rendered both <b>sterol</b> and <b>stanol</b> unsuitable for either function. The C- 28 methyl group of ergosterol, while found not to be required for growth, allowed for greater ease of in vivo desaturation at C- 5. As a result some <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> lacking the C- 28 methyl were incapable of satisfying the sparking requirement while identical compounds possessing the C- 28 methyl were able to fulfill the sparking function(s). These data are extended to hypothesize a role for the C- 28 methyl group as well as other functional moieties of ergosterol in yeast. Physiological studies are also undertaken in an attempt to define the sparking phenomenon better...|$|R

Quantitative results were compared with single-column GC analysis. The latter samples included sterols of interest, but which cannot be readily obtained elsewhere. It may also mimic potential environmental samples where dairy production and aquaculture (oyster, mussel cultivation) share the same catchment; environmental sterol signatures may exhibit characteristics of both sample types comprising this mixture. Whereas single-column GC-flame ionisation detection was unable to reliably quantitate target sterols, the GC×GC experiment permitted small amounts of <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> to be detected and separated.

When natural organic matter (NOM) is modelled by humic acid, increasing DOC concentration from 2. 7 to 15. 4 mg/L has no significant impact on the recovery of <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols.</b> The modelling of NOM by a mixture of humic acid and succinoglycan induces a significant (24 %) decrease in the recovery of <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols.</b> For all concentrations of target compounds, no significant increase in recovery is associated with increasing the salinity. Moreover, an increase in the recovery of target compounds is induced by an increase in their concentration. The nine target compounds and the recovery standard (RS) exhibit the same behaviour during the extraction step. Thus, we propose that (a) the concentration of target compounds can be corrected by the RS to calculate more realistic concentrations without modifying their profile and (b) the sterol fingerprint can be investigated in the colloidal fraction of aqueous samples without altering the information it could provide about the source. The application of this analytical method to waste water treatment plant influent and effluents yields results in agreement with previous studies concerning the use of those compounds to differentiate between sources of faecal contamination.

Plant sterols are found in low quantities in all fatty plant-based foods such as oils, nuts, seeds and cereals. For humans, they are not essential and are hardly used in the human metabolism.

The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) below assesses a study from the Netherlands which provides valuable information on the unwanted effects of plant sterols on human retinal microvessels.

50|$|Phytosterols, which {{encompass}} plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols,</b> are phytosteroids {{similar to}} cholesterol which occur in plants and vary only in carbon side chains and/or {{presence or absence}} of a double bond. <b>Stanols</b> are saturated <b>sterols,</b> having no double bonds in the sterol ring structure. More than 200 sterols and related compounds have been identified. Free phytosterols extracted from oils are insoluble in water, relatively insoluble in oil, and soluble in alcohols.|$|R

Nutrition and Toxicology Research Institute Maastricht (NUTRIM), Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands. d. kerckhoffs@hb. unimass. nl The {{effects of}} beta-glucan, soy protein, isoflavones, plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols,</b> garlic and tocotrienols on serum lipoproteins {{have been of}} great {{interest}} the last decade. From a critical review of the literature, it appeared that recent studies found positive as well as no effects of beta-glucan from oats on serum LDL cholesterol concentrations. These conflicting results may suggest that the cholesterol-lowering activity of products rich in oat beta-glucan depends on factors, such as its viscosity in the gastrointestinal tract, the food matrix and/or food processing. The effects of beta-glucan from barley or yeast on the lipoprotein profile are promising, but more human trials are needed to further substantiate these effects. It is still {{not clear whether the}} claimed hypocholesterolemic effects of soy can be attributed solely to the isoflavones. Several studies found no changes in serum LDL cholesterol concentrations after consumption of isolated soy isoflavones (without soy protein), indicating that a combination of soy protein and isoflavones may be needed for eliciting a cholesterol-lowering effect of soy. Therefore, the exact (combination of) active ingredients in soy products need to be identified. The daily consumption of 2 - 3 g of plant <b>sterols</b> or <b>stanols</b> reduces LDL cholesterol concentrations by 9 - 14 %. It has been demonstrated that functional foods enriched with plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols</b> are effective in various population groups, and in combination with cholesterol-lowering diets or drugs. Whether garlic or garlic preparations {{can be used as a}} lipid-lowering agent is still uncertain. It is important to characterize the active components in garlic and their bioavailability after ingestion. It is not very likely that tocotrienols from palm oil or rice bran oil have favorable effects on the human serum lipoprotein profile. Publication Types: Review Review, Academi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Phytosterols are {{bioactive}} compounds {{found in}} foods of plant origin, {{which can be}} divided into plant <b>sterols</b> and plant <b>stanols.</b> Clinical studies consistently indicate that the intake of phytosterols (2 g/day) is associated with a significant reduction (8 - 10 %) in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-cholesterol). Thus, several guidelines recommend the intake of 2 g/day of plant <b>sterols</b> and/or <b>stanols</b> in order to reduce LDL-cholesterol levels. As the typical western diet contains only about 300 mg/day of phytosterols, foods enriched with phytosterols are usually used to achieve the recommended intake. Although phytosterols decrease LDL-cholesterol levels, {{there is no evidence that}} they reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases; on the contrary, some studies suggest an increased risk of atherosclerosis with increasing serum levels of phytosterols. This review aims to address the evidence available in the literature on the relationship between phytosterols and risk of cardiovascular disease...|$|R
25|$|Phytosterols {{are widely}} {{recognized}} as having a proven LDL cholesterol lowering efficacy. Current supplemental guidelines recommend doses of phytosterols in the 1.6-3.0grams per day range (Health Canada, EFSA, ATP III, FDA) with a recent meta-analysis demonstrating an 8.8% reduction in LDL-cholesterol at a mean dose of 2.15gram per day. However, plant <b>sterols</b> and <b>stanols,</b> if absorbed (intestinal cells generally block), greatly accelerate progression of atherosclerosis more than cholesterol delivered into the arterial walls by lipoprotein particles.|$|R
