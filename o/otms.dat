40|$|The need {{to reduce}} CO 2 {{emissions}} from fossil-fuel based power production creates {{the need for new}} power plant solutions where the CO 2 is captured and stored or reused. Oxygen Transfer Membrane (<b>OTM)</b> is the key component of oxy-fuel combustion processes as pure oxygen is usually required to process reactions (e. g. Natural Gas Combined cycle NGCC, Pulverised Coal-fired power plants PC-plants, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle IGCC). The transfer of oxygen across such <b>OTM</b> is limited by a number of processes, such as surface exchange and ambipolar diffusion through mixed-conducting gas separation layer. This paper shows a mathematical model of an oxygen transfer membrane incorporated into <b>OTM</b> reactor (<b>OTM</b> reactor consists of High Temperature Heat Exchanger and <b>OTM),</b> where transient behavior takes place. The modeling of the <b>OTM</b> reactor has been carried out to show the importance of optimizing <b>OTM</b> parameters (temperatures, oxygen partial pressures, oxygen flux) and reactor design that enables a high oxygen transfer for optimum performance of future power cycles with CO 2 capture. All modeling work was carried out in the modeling language Modelica, which is an open standard for equation-based, object-oriented modeling of physical systems.

5000|$|Quoted from Status Report - October 13, 1994Communication {{with the}} Magellan {{spacecraft}} was lost early Wednesday morning, following an aggressive series of five Orbit Trim Maneuvers (<b>OTMs)</b> on Tuesday, October 11, which took the orbit {{down into the}} upper atmosphere of Venus. The Termination experiment (extension of September [...] "Windmill" [...] experiment) design was expected to result in final loss of the spacecraft due to a negative power margin. This {{was not a problem}} since spacecraft power would have been too low to sustain operations {{in the next few weeks}} due to continuing solar cell loss.Thus, a final controlled experiment was designed to maximize mission return. This final, low altitude was necessary to study the effects of a carbon dioxide atmosphere.The final OTM took the periapsis to 139.7 km where the sensible drag on the spacecraft was very evident. The solar panel temperatures rose to 126 deg. C. and the attitude control system fired all available Y-axis thrusters to counteract the torques. However, attitude control was maintained to the end.The main bus voltage dropped to 24.7 volts after five orbits, and it was predicted that attitude control would be lost if the power dropped below 24 volts. It was decided to enhance the Windmill experiment by changing the panel angles for the remaining orbits. This was also a preplanned experiment option.At this point, the spacecraft was expected to survive only two orbits.Magellan continued to maintain communication for three more orbits, even though the power continued to drop below 23 volts and eventually reached 20.4 volts. At this time, one battery went off-line, and the spacecraft was defined as power starved.Communication was lost at 3:02 AM PDT just as Magellan was about to enter an Earth occultation on orbit 15032. Contact was not re-established. Tracking operations were continued to 11:00 AM but no signal was seen, and none was expected. The spacecraft should land on Venus by 1:00 PM PDT Thursday, October 13, 1994.|$|E

40|$|Oral-transmucosal (<b>OTM)</b> drug {{delivery}} refers to noninvasive and painless administration of medical preparations through any oral cavity membrane to achieve systemic effects (Sattar et al., 2014). Regarding sedative drugs, <b>OTM</b> administration is very attractive in veterinary medicine, especially for patients difficult to inject and restrain (Messenger et al., 2016). This study aims {{to compare the}} pharmacokinetics of dexmedetomidine after <b>OTM</b> and intramuscular (IM) administration combined with methadone. After obtaining Ethical Committee approval and owner’s written consent, eight dogs, were administered with dexmedetomidine (10 mg/kg) and methadone (0. 4 mg/kg) by <b>OTM</b> and other 4 dogs by IM route. Blood samples were collected at prefixed times up to four hours. Dexmedetomidine was quantified by a validated HPLC-MS method. On dexmedetomidine concentrations, a pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out with a noncompartmental approach (Phoenix WinNonlin® 7. 0, Pharsight, Cary, NC). Mean ± SD terminal half-lives of dexmedetomidine were 187. 42 ± 109. 66 and 94. 78 ± 34. 08 min after <b>OTM</b> and IM administration, respectively. Maximum serum (Cmax) concentrations were 0. 83 ± 0. 32 and 9. 09 ± 2. 46 ng/mL for <b>OTM</b> and IM administration, respectively. Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) were 44. 38 ± 32. 16 and 21. 25 ± 11. 39 min by <b>OTM</b> and IM administration, respectively.

40|$|Objectives The {{diagnosis}} of transient neurological attacks (TNA) relies on medical history. Transient ischemic attack is often considered until proven otherwise, {{because of lack}} of objective paraclinical tools that can help discriminate TIA from differential diagnoses such as migraine aura. This may lead to needless and potentially harmful stroke secondary prevention in many cases. This study aimed at determining the yield of occipital transcranial magnetic stimulation (<b>oTMS)</b> in discriminating TNA of vascular origin from migraine aura without headache (MAWH). Methods Ten patients with acute TNA of vascular origin and ten patients with migraine aura without headache (MAWH), without prior history of migrainous headache, were prospectively included. TNA of vascular origin were considered for individuals presenting unilateral focal symptoms with full resolution within 24 hours and positive diffusion weighted imaging (DWI+). For individuals with MAWH, diagnostic criteria were either ICHD-III beta or Fischer criteria for a first episode of MAWH. All participants underwent one session of <b>oTMS.</b> Induction and threshold of phosphene induction were recorded.

This monolayer can then be selectively removed by UV photolithography. Under appropriate solution conditions, the <b>OTMS</b> regions will adsorb a monolayer of bovine serum albumin (BSA), while the silicon dioxide regions where the <b>OTMS</b> has been removed by UV light will adsorb less than 2 % of a monolayer, thus creating high contrast patterned adsorption of BSA.

40|$|Oxygen Transport Membranes (<b>OTMs)</b> can {{drastically}} {{reduce the}} energy and cost demands of processes that require pure oxygen, as they offer the possibility to combine a separation unit with a chemical reactor. One of the most commercially viable applications of <b>OTMs</b> is the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons for syngas production. A typical OTM configuration is a sequential arrangement of layers, i. e. an inactive support, a fuel oxidation layer, a dense layer and an oxygen reduction layer. However, one {{of the limitations of}} the OTM system is the low catalytic activity and stability of the materials currently used for the fuel oxidation layer. Moreover, the traditional deposition techniques that are used for the catalysts preparation are difficult to perform, as the fuel oxidation layer is buried deeply {{in the structure of the}} OTM. To simplify the OTM fabrication and improve the catalysts activity and stability, this thesis explores the exsolution of Ni nanoparticles from two different host lattice compositions, as potential materials for the fuel oxidation layer of <b>OTMs.</b> The (La₀. ₇₅Sr₀. ₂₅) (Cr₀. ₅Mn₀. ₄₅Ni₀. ₅) O₃ (LSCMNi 5) perovskite was selected, as the first candidate material for the <b>OTMs.</b> During reduction, the exsolution of Ni nanoparticles from the perovskite lattice took place and enhanced significantly the catalytic activity of the material regarding methane conversion. However, these nanoparticles were oxidised during the first hours of the testing and slowly reincorporated into the perovskite structure, leading to drop in the performance. Thereafter, the (La₀. ₇₅Sr₀. ₂₅) (Cr₀. ₅Mn₀. ₄₅Ni₀. ₅) O₃ (LSCMNi 5) perovskite was selected as an alternative composition. When the oxide lattice was sufficiently reduced, the exsolution of Fe-Ni alloy nanoparticles occurred.

The functionalization of <b>OTMS</b> on the surface of ZNRs was characterized and confirmed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The OTMS-ZNRs coated fiber exhibited stronger hydrophobicity after functionalization, and its extraction efficiency for non-polar benzene homologues was increased by a factor of 1. 5 - 3. 6 when compared to a ZNRs fiber with almost identical thickness and facade. In contrast, the extraction efficiency of the OTMS-ZNRs coated fiber for polar aldehydes was 1. 6 - 4. 0 -fold lower than that of the ZNRs coated fiber, further indicating its enhanced surface hydrophobicity.

To correct the tidal gravity factors from ocean loading effects {{we compared the}} load vectors from different ocean tides models (<b>OTMs)</b> computed with different software: OLFG/OLMP by the Free Ocean Tides Loading Provider (FLP), ICET and NLOADF. Even with the recent <b>OTMs</b> the mass conservation is critical but the methods used to correct the mass imbalance agree within 0. 1 nm/s 2.

The theoretical body tides model DDW 99 /NH provides the best agreement for M 2 (1. 1620) and MATH 01 /NH for O 1 (1. 1540) and K 1 (1. 1350). The largest discrepancy is for O 1 (0. 05 %). The corrected phase αc does not differ significantly from zero except for K 1 and S 2. The calibrations of the two SG's are consistent within 0. 025 % and agree with Strasbourg results within 0. 05 %...|$|E

LSCM exhibits a rhombohedral structure and LSCF an orthorhombic structure. Both materials retain their structures, after doping the B site with Ni, with small {{changes on the}} unit cell parameters. Thermal analysis under reducing conditions was used to investigate the reducibility of these perovskites up to 900 °C, {{which appears to be}} enhanced by doping with Ni. The formation of Ni nanoparticles (30 – 50 nm) on the LSCMNi and LSCFNi grains was observed by scanning electron microscopy, after reducing the samples in 5 % H 2 /Ar at 900 °C, indicating possible enhanced catalytic activity and potential benefits {{for the development of the}} <b>OTMs.</b> DC conductivity measurements conducted under a redox cycle, indicate that LSCFNi presents a better redox stability than LSCMNi...|$|E
