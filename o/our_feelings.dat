5|$|Self-empathy {{involves}} compassionately {{connecting with}} {{what is going on}} inside us. This may involve, without blame, noticing the thoughts and judgments we are having, noticing <b>our</b> <b>feelings,</b> and most critically, connecting to the needs that are affecting us.|$|E
5|$|The Sermons of Swift {{have none}} of that thunder which appals, or that resistless and winning {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in a tone of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches <b>our</b> <b>feelings</b> in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the feelings of the preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E

500|$|On February 12, 1994, {{during a}} rally {{to raise money}} for the defendants' {{mounting}} legal bills, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan supported the three aldermen's right to seize the painting, calling it [...] "an act of righteous indignation". Farrakhan referred to Washington as [...] "a father figure for black people", and described the painting and subsequent lawsuit [...] "a total disrespect for <b>our</b> <b>feelings</b> and our community".|$|E
500|$|Feelings: {{emotions}} or sensations, free {{of thought}} and story. These are to be distinguished from thoughts (e.g., [...] "I feel I didn't get a fair deal") and from words colloquially used as feelings but which convey what {{we think we are}} (e.g., [...] "inadequate"), how we think others are evaluating us (e.g., [...] "unimportant"), or what we think others are doing to us (e.g., [...] "misunderstood", [...] "ignored"). Feelings are said to reflect whether we are experiencing our needs as met or unmet. Identifying feelings is said to allow us to more easily connect with one another, and [...] "Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing <b>our</b> <b>feelings</b> can help resolve conflicts." ...|$|E

500|$|Some reviewers {{have placed}} parts the novel in the mystery genre. Edinger found {{that despite the}} broad genres, the novel is mainly [...] "a thrilling puzzle". She relates the pieces slowly; clues {{are found in the}} story itself, on the map, in words and chapter titles. At {{the end of the book}} {{everything}} is tied together and makes sense. Ann Crewdson of School Library Journal found that each note Miranda receives foreshadows the next event. Each note is [...] "skillfully" [...] integrated into the novel, along with subsequent clues, until the climax is reached and all the clues come together. Stead's editor Lamb agreed with the mystery genre, in that [...] "there's plenty to wonder about after you finish the book. Just as we wonder why <b>our</b> <b>feelings</b> change so suddenly, or why someone like the laughing man appears on the corner one day." [...] Gurdon of The Wall Street Journal concurred with Lamb, adding that although the novel is clearly a mystery, the mystery itself is not revealed until the end where the last note comes and where everything ties together.|$|E

2500|$|In his What Is Literature?, Sartre wrote, [...] "On the one hand, the {{literary}} object has no substance but the reader's subjectivity ...

2500|$|Janov {{believes}} {{that much of}} the pain of childhood is the result of needs going unmet. Drawing from earlier psychologists, he described his take on the basic needs in his books. [...] "Our first needs are solely physical ones for nourishment, safety and comfort. Later we have emotional needs for affection, understanding and respect for <b>our</b> <b>feelings.</b> Finally, intellectual needs to know and to understand emerge." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lorde's poetry {{became more}} open and {{personal}} as she grew older and became more confident in her sexuality. In , Lorde states, [...] "Poetry {{is the way we}} help give name to the nameless so it can be thought…As they become known to and accepted by us, <b>our</b> <b>feelings</b> and the honest exploration of them become sanctuaries and spawning grounds for the most radical and daring ideas." [...] Sister Outsider also elaborates Lorde's challenge to European-American traditions.|$|E
5000|$|When later {{asked the}} reasons for the name [...] "At Sunset", Harrison Kantarias noted 'At Sunset' was decided upon because: [...] "the name is a metaphor for <b>our</b> <b>feeling</b> towards music.

2500|$|Their {{blend of}} several musical styles and many diverse {{influences}} makes it challenging to classify them into one particular music genre or scene. They say they {{try not to}} restrict themselves to one type of music or try to fit into any scene. This creative approach in making music is according to Levin directly reflected in their name: [...] "Musically we’re stateless, we don’t belong to any particular scene." [...] James states their name reflects where they belong creatively: [...] "It mainly means; Freedom. We want {{to be free from}} barriers, borders and any restrictions really." [...] and that it is [...] "reflecting <b>our</b> <b>feelings</b> about the way we make music. No boundaries, no pigeon-holes, no rules." ...|$|E

[...] They rejoice that Penelope Ann {{is out of the}} way. Suddenly, Box observes that Cox must surely be his long-lost brother, and Cox says {{that he was about to}} make the same observation: Box asks if Cox has a strawberry mark on his left arm. Cox replies that he does not. That settles it: they are long-lost brothers. In a brief finale, they agree that they will remain in the room for good, with Bouncer adding a [...] "Rataplan!" [...] reprise. The curtain falls on general rejoicing.|$|E
2500|$|Also in April 1815 was John Taylor Coleridge's {{review for}} the British Critic, which read, [...] "This {{is the first}} time that we have had an {{opportunity}} of paying Mr. Southey the attention which he deserves; and we avail ourselves of it gladly [...] Mr. Southey is eminently a moral writer; to the high purpose implied in this title, the melody of his numbers, the clear rapidity of his style, the pathetic power which he exercises over <b>our</b> <b>feelings,</b> and the interesting manner of telling his story, whether in verse or prose, are all merely contributive." [...] The review concluded: [...] "here is plenty of sword and dagger, war-horse and chariot, a bugle or two, some little love, several beauties, and even a marriage in prospectu, with all the other ingredients of a 'charming poem.' If any one doat so desperately on 'love and glory,' that this does not content him, we are very sorry, but we cannot honestly recommend Don Roderick to his attention." ...|$|E

5000|$|Behavior ("Total Behavior" [...] in Glasser's terms) {{is made up}} {{of these}} four {{components:}} acting, thinking, feeling, and physiology. Glasser suggests we have considerable control or choice over the first two of these; yet, little ability to directly choose the latter two as they are more deeply sub- and unconscious. These four components remain closely intertwined, the choices we make in our thinking and acting greatly affect <b>our</b> <b>feeling</b> and physiology.|$|R

2500|$|One of {{his best}} friends was fellow actor Henry Fonda, {{despite the fact that the}} two had very {{different}} political ideologies. A political argument in 1947 resulted in a fistfight, but they maintained their friendship by never discussing politics again. This tale may be apocryphal as Jhan Robbins quotes Stewart as saying: [...] "Our views never interfered with <b>our</b> <b>feelings</b> for each other, we just didn't talk about certain things. I can't remember ever having an argument with him—ever!" [...] However, Jane Fonda told Donald Dewey for his 1996 biography of Stewart that her father did have a falling out with Stewart at that time, although she did not know whether it was because of their political differences. There is a brief reference to their political differences in character in their movie The Cheyenne Social Club. In the last years of his life, he donated to the campaign of Bob Dole in the 1996 presidential election and to Democratic Florida governor Bob Graham in his successful run for the Senate.|$|E
2500|$|Keelung {{was finally}} {{evacuated}} on 22 June 1885. [...] Under arrangements agreed between Liu Mingchuan and Admiral Lespès on 17 June, the French withdrew from their forts on Hung-tan-shan and Yueh-mei-shan in stages, over a three-day period, and their positions were reoccupied by the Chinese {{only after a}} prudent delay. [...] The Chinese officers kept their men well in hand, and the occupation of the French forts was conducted with dignity and restraint. [...] "There was not the slightest demonstration of triumph, nothing that could hurt <b>our</b> <b>feelings,</b> nothing that could wound our legitimate pride," [...] wrote one French officer. [...] The French flag that had flown above Keelung for eight months was lowered to a 21-gun salute from the ironclad La Galissonnière. [...] Colonel Duchesne, {{the commander of the}} Formosa expeditionary corps, was the last French soldier to embark aboard the waiting transports. [...] The men of the Formosa expeditionary corps were ferried either to Makung in the Pescadores, which would remain [...] in French hands for another month, or to Along Bay in Tonkin, to rejoin the Tonkin expeditionary corps.|$|E
2500|$|The US Department of State {{issued a}} 17 May 2012 {{directive}} {{stating that the}} Chinese professors at university-based CIs were violating their J-1 visas by teaching in schools at the precollege level {{and would have to}} return to China by 30 June to apply for a new visa. In addition, the institutes would be required to obtain US academic accreditation. Chinese officials reportedly applied pressure on Washington in response. On 24 May, State Department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said there was [...] "a mess-up in the processing in general" [...] and called the original directive [...] "sloppy and incomplete." [...] The State Department said it would arrange the appropriate visa categories for Chinese teachers, without them needing to leave the country and re-apply. Chinese state media reacted strongly to the initial announcement, with Global Times editorializing that, [...] "the promotion of Chinese language and culture by Confucius Institutes makes some Americans uneasy." [...] Xu Lin, head of the Hanban, told a CI conference in Edinburgh, [...] "The US government hurt <b>our</b> <b>feelings,</b> but Confucius Institutes across Europe have done a great job, especially with cultural promotion, which is not surprising given Europe's rich history and culture." ...|$|E
