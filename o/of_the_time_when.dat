In addition, the Europeans often referred to the Wi:pukba and Guwevkabaya incorrectly as the Yavapai Apache or Yuma Apache. The Europeans referred to the Ɖo:lkabaya, the southwestern group of Yavapai, and the Hualapai (who belonged to the Upland Yuma Peoples), as Yuma Apache or Mohave Apache.|$|E
5|$|After sailing {{for some}} hours, Leopard, {{commanded}} by Captain Salusbury Pryce Humphreys, approached Chesapeake and hailed {{a request to}} deliver dispatches to England, a customary request <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> a British lieutenant arrived by boat he handed Barron an order, given by Vice-Admiral George Berkeley of the Royal Navy, which instructed the British ships to stop and board Chesapeake to search for deserters. Barron refused to allow this search, and as the lieutenant returned to Leopard Barron ordered the crew to general quarters. Shortly afterward Leopard hailed Chesapeake; Barron could not understand the message. Leopard fired a shot across the bow, followed by a broadside, at Chesapeake. For fifteen minutes, while Chesapeake attempted to arm herself, Leopard continued to fire broadside after broadside until Barron struck his colors. Chesapeake only managed to fire one retaliatory shot after hot coals from the galley were brought on deck to ignite the cannon. The British boarded Chesapeake and carried off four crewmen, declining Barron's offer that Chesapeake {{be taken as a}} prize of war. Chesapeake had three sailors killed and Barron was among the 18wounded.|$|E
5|$|Crawley {{lies within}} the Sussex Weald, {{an area of}} highly {{variable}} terrain, so that many microclimates of frost hollows, sun traps and windswept hilltops will be encountered over a short distance. During calm, clear periods of weather this allows for some interesting temperature variations, although most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>when</b> mobile westerly airstreams persist, the weather is typically Oceanic {{like the rest of}} the British Isles. Gatwick is the nearest weather station that publishes long-term averages that give an accurate description of the climate of the Crawley area, although more recently the Met Office has also published data for its nearby weather station at Charlwood. Both weather stations are about 3 miles north of Crawley town centre and at similar altitudes.|$|E

5|$|Whimpress tabled various {{hypotheses}} for Crockett's actions. At the time, Crockett was 37 {{years old}} {{and was ready to}} emerge from the shadow of Phillips, the eminent Australian umpire <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> Crockett called Marsh, it was his 29th match as a first-class umpire and the no-balling was seen in some quarters as a signal that he felt ready to officiate in Test matches. A cynical view of Crockett's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then the umpire was going to choose a soft target. This theory ruled out the calling of a fellow Victorian, his state of origin. The same line of reasoning concluded that a New South Welshman would be called, and likely not a high-profile Test player like Noble or Jack Saunders. Those who adhered to this hypothesis believed that it would be easier for Crockett to target someone who had a previous stigma of throwing and that Marsh—an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17.38—was an ideal target.|$|E

Mrs Messervy had a 60% shareholding, Sayeed had 30%, and 10% was owned by Mrs Genie Ford (who ran operations in the US).|$|E

25|$|The castle was {{constructed}} between 1270 and 1282 {{in the typical}} square plan of the fortifications in Savoy. The end of the 15th century stands out as the golden age {{in the history of}} the counts. In 1476, count Louis takes part in the Burgundy war by the Confederates’ side. Following this deed of valour, modernization works were undertaken. The adjustment of the esplanade with its chapel, the spiral staircase in the courtyard and the transformation of the main building go back to that time. Thus, the castle loses its fortress appearance to become a stately residence. The baroque interiors remind one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> the bailiffs sent by Fribourg lived there. The romantic landscapes were painted in the mid-19th century by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Barthélemy Menn and other artists.|$|E
25|$|A {{school of}} higher {{education}} had long been an aspiration of the colonists. An early attempt at Henricus failed after the Indian Massacre of 1622. The location at {{the outskirts of the}} developed part of the colony had left it more vulnerable to the attack. In the 1690s, the colonists tried again to establish a school. They commissioned Reverend James Blair, who spent several years in England lobbying, and finally obtained a royal charter for the desired new school. It was to be named the College of William & Mary in honor of the monarchs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> Reverend Blair returned to Virginia, the new school was founded in a safe place, Middle Plantation in 1693. Classes began in temporary quarters in 1694, and the College Building, a precursor to the Wren Building, was soon under construction.|$|E
25|$|María García Granados y Saborío (1860-May 10, 1878), {{also known}} as La Niña de Guatemala ("the little girl of Guatemala"), was a Guatemalan socialite, {{daughter}} of General Miguel García Granados, who was President of Guatemala from 1871 to 1873 and whose house served as a gathering for the top artists and writers of the time. María was also niece and granddaughter of María Josefa García Granados, an influential poet and journalist <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>When</b> Cuban poet and patriot José Martí came to Guatemala in 1877, {{he was invited to}} General Garcia Granados gatherings {{and fell in love with}} Maria there, but could not correspond her because he was already engaged to marry Ms. Carmen Zayas Bazán. María died in 1878, shortly after learning that Martí had married, and he immortalized her in his 1891 poem La Niña de Guatemala.|$|E

25|$|From 1 January 1876 onwards, the Mark {{became the}} only legal tender. The name Goldmark was created later to {{distinguish}} it from the Papiermark (papermark) which suffered a serious loss of value through hyperinflation following World War I (see inflation in the Weimar Republic). The goldmark was on a gold standard with 2790 Mark equal to 1 kilogram of pure gold (1 Mark = 358mg). From 1900 to 1933, the United States adhered to a gold standard as well, with {{the value of the}} dollar being fixed at a price of approximately one-twentieth ounce (troy weight) of gold (one troy ounce of gold was actually valued at US$20.67). The goldmark therefore had a value of approximately U.S. $0.25.

25|$|Under a Charter of Incorporation 1848, A Watch Committee {{was formed}} {{and the first}} members of the Halifax Borough Police were {{appointed}} on 7 July of that year. In April 1903 Richardson took up his post as Chief Constable of Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire, in the then relatively new building housing the Magistrates' Court, the Coroner's Court and Police Station.

He, with his wife and young son, moved to a large detached stone-built house in Clover Hill Road, Halifax (known as Clover Lea in 1903, but soon there were concerns by the Halifax Watch Committee about his general safety. There was a surge of threats to officials at this time, including the British Royal Family, and he had to move in closer to the town centre and live nearer the Police station at Harrison Road.
