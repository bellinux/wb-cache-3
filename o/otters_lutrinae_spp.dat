40|$|International audienceWe report new dental {{remains of}} Mustelidae {{from the late}} middle Miocene of Mae Moh Basin, {{northern}} Thailand, improving the poor fossil record {{of the family in}} Southeast Asia. Siamogale thailandica is a poorly known mustelid, previously recorded from just a single tooth. Here we present over a hundred new specimens attributable to this species. S. thailandica shows a combination of primitive and convergent features of the dentition that makes its original subfamilial assignment to Lutrinae doubtful. Evidence from the dental morphology suggests that it belongs to a bunodont otter-like mustelid that evolved in convergence with "true" <b>otters</b> (<b>Lutrinae)</b> toward a semi-aquatic way of life. Autapomorphic features such as the height and the position of the m 1 metaconid and the shape of the P 4 lingual shelf make S. thailandica unique among Mustelidae. The morphology of this species is mostly similar to Mionictis species and Lartetictis dubia, reported in the Miocene of North America and Europe, respectively. These similarities could imply immigration events to Thailand in the early or middle Miocene. Alternately, the lineage leading to Siamogale might have deeper origins from an endemic early Miocene Southeast Asian mustelid...|$|R
50|$|The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), {{also known}} as the European otter, Eurasian river otter, common otter, and Old World otter, is a semiaquatic mammal native to Eurasia. The most widely {{distributed}} member of the <b>otter</b> subfamily (<b>Lutrinae)</b> of the weasel family (Mustelidae), it is found in the waterways and coasts of Europe, many parts of Asia, and parts of northern Africa. The Eurasian otter has a diet mainly of fish, and is strongly territorial. It is endangered in parts of its range, but recovering in others.|$|R
50|$|The Asian small-clawed otter (Aonyx cinerea syn. Amblonyx cinereus), {{also known}} as the oriental small-clawed otter or simply small-clawed otter, is a semiaquatic mammal native to South and Southeast Asia. It {{is a member of the}} <b>otter</b> {{subfamily}} (<b>Lutrinae)</b> of the weasel family (Mustelidae), and is the smallest otter species in the world. Its paws are a distinctive feature; its claws do not extend beyond the fleshy end pads of its partially webbed fingers and toes. This gives it a high degree of manual dexterity so that it can use its paws to feed on molluscs, crabs and other small aquatic animals.|$|R
50|$|Cyrnaonyx is an extinct genus of <b>Lutrinae,</b> <b>otters</b> {{from the}} Pleistocene. It was {{originally}} described by Helbing based on materials from France {{and he also}} attributed material from Corse to it. The latter appeared to belong to another species and genus, Algarolutra majori. The only species of Cyrnaonyx is C. antiqua. It is known from the Pleistocene (Holsteinian to Eemian/Weichselian) of Europe: France, Germany, Netherlands, Southern England and probably Italy.|$|R

We then presented otter groups with a series of novel foraging tasks, and inferred social transmission of task solutions with Network-Based Diffusion Analysis.

500|$|The <b>otters</b> {{form the}} <b>Lutrinae</b> {{subfamily}} within the mustelids {{and the giant}} otter is {{the only member of}} the genus Pteronura. Two subspecies are currently recognized by the canonical Mammal Species of the World, P. b. brasiliensis and P. b. paraguensis. Incorrect descriptions of the species have led to multiple synonyms (the latter subspecies is often P. b. paranensis in the literature). P. b. brasiliensis is distributed across the north of the giant otter range, including the Orinoco, Amazon, and Guianas river systems; to the south, P. b. paraguensis has been suggested in Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Brazil, and northern Argentina, although it may be extinct in the last three of these four. The World Conservation Union (IUCN) considers the species' presence in Argentina and Uruguay uncertain. In the former, investigation has shown thinly distributed population remnants. P. b. paraguensis is supposedly smaller and more gregarious, with different dentition and skull morphology. Carter and Rosas, however, rejected the subspecific division in 1997, noting the classification had only been validated once, in 1968, and the P. b. paraguensis type specimen was very similar to P. b. brasiliensis. Biologist Nicole Duplaix calls the division of [...] "doubtful value".|$|R
40|$|The Japanese otter lived {{throughout}} {{four main}} Japanese islands, {{but it has}} not been observed in the wild since 1979 and was declared extinct in 2012. Although recent taxonomic and molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that it should be treated as an independent species, International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List considers it as subspecies of Lutra lutra. Therefore, the taxonomic status of this species needs to be resolved. Here we determined the complete mitochondrial genome of two Japanese otters caught in Kanagawa and Kochi prefectures and five Eurasian otters (L. lutra). We reconstructed a molecular phylogenetic tree to estimate the phylogenetic position of the Japanese <b>otter</b> in <b>Lutrinae</b> using the Japanese otters and the other 11 Lutrinae species on the basis of ND 5 (692 bp) and cytochrome b (1, 140 bp) sequences. We observed that the two Japanese otters had close relationships with Eurasian otters, forming a monophyletic group (100 % bootstrap probability). To elucidate detailed phylogenetic relationships among the Japanese and Eurasian otters, we reconstructed a maximum likelihood tree according to mitochondrial genome sequences (14, 740 bp). The Japanese otter (JO 1) collected in Kanagawa was deeply nested in the Eurasian otter clade, whereas the Japanese otter (JO 2) collected in Kochi formed a distinct independent lineage in the Lutra clade. The estimated molecular divergences time for the ancestral lineages of the Japanese otters was 0. 10 Ma (95 %: 0. 06 - 0. 16 Ma) and 1. 27 Ma (95 %: 0. 98 - 1. 59 Ma) for JO 1 and JO 2 lineages, respectively. Thus, JO 1 was identified as a member of L. lutra; JO 2 represented the old Japanese otter lineage, which may be a distinct new species or subspecies of Lutra. We suggest that the ancestral population of the JO 2 lineage migrated to Japan via the land bridge that existed between western Japanese islands and Asian continent at 1. 27 Ma...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{revision}} of the Pliocene and Quaternary Lutrinae from Europe is presented. Such {{a revision}}, including fossil material, has not been published since the work of Pohle (1919). Three tribes within the Lutrinae are recognized: the Lutrini, the Aonyxini and the Enhydrini. The latter comprises both Enhydra and the Enhydriodon group. The genus Nesolutra, consisting of three insular species, is not retained. Two are included in Lutra and for N. ichnusae a new genus, Sardolutra, is proposed. The genus Isolalutra is not retained either. Its only species, I. cretensis, {{is included in the}} genus Lutrogale. Some new material of this species is described. A number of well-preserved fossils of Cyrnaonyx antiqua are described, such as the hitherto unknown skull and upper carnassial as well as postcranial material from Tornewton Cave. The systematic position of the species and genus is reviewed in detail. A new specimen of Enhydra reevei from Bramerton is described. The morphology of the M 1 supports the inclusion of the species in Enhydra. The functional morphology and the ecology of the reviewed species is discussed and compared to extant lutrines. Adaptations in the postcranial skeleton indicate a very aquatic way of life for Lutra simplicidens, L. trinacriae, L. euxena and, to an even greater extent, Sardolutra. Lutrogale cretensis on the contrary shows a more terrestrial adaptation. Cyrnaonyx shows adaptations similar to Lutra and probably was a stream dweller, thus differing from its extant relative Aonyx. From the dentition and the endocranial cast, conclusions on the feeding habits are drawn. The described Lutra and Sardolutra species were probably all specialized on motile prey, viz. fish. Lutrogale, Algarolutra, Megalenhydris and Cyrnaonyx show adaptations to a mixed diet, consisting of both fish and shellfish, though differences in the feeding habits between those forms are noted also. Enhydra reevei probably fed on shellfish exclusively. In the last part, the phylogeny and palaeogeography of the Lutrinae are discussed. It is argued that the oldest <b>Lutrinae,</b> Mionictis <b>spp.,</b> originated from the Melinae. The phylogeny of the Lutrini can be reconstructed relatively well. The ancestry of the island forms in the Mediterranean is discussed in some detail. For the Aonyxini, the fossil record is rather poor and a reconstruction of the phylogeny is virtually impossible. The origin of Cyrnaonyx is uncertain and the ancestry of Megalenhydris is unknown. The origin of the Enhydrini is somewhat obscure. The group reached a wide distribution and gave rise to the Enhydra line. The relationships between the species are discussed. The problems involved in island species are considered. Remarks on the presence of otters in unbalanced island faunas are made. The peculiar taphonomy of otter fossils on islands is noted...|$|R
