30|$|A major {{limitation}} of the present research lies in its cross-sectional design. The relationships between religious identity, acculturation <b>orientations</b> <b>and</b> socio-cultural adjustment are merely correlational, and thereby do not allow for causal interpretations. To gain more clarity about the proposed relationships and the roles of acculturation conditions, <b>orientations</b> <b>and</b> outcomes, longitudinal study designs would be needed.

The coping behavior of women of different sexual <b>orientations</b> with masculine <b>and</b> feminine gender identity differs more strongly than the coping behavior of women of different sexual orientation with androgynous gender identity.

40|$|While much {{attention}} has been paid to the <b>orientations</b> <b>and</b> structures of the habit planes of various precipitates, the <b>orientations</b> <b>and</b> structures of the edge facets are less well understood. This work presents a new approach to the interpretation of edge facets. The <b>orientations</b> <b>and</b> dislocation structures of the edge facets of α precipitates in a β matrix in a Ti- 7. 26 wt. % Cr alloy were investigated with a near-coincidence-sites (NCS) model combined with the analysis of Moiré planes based on the O-lattice theory. The distribution of NCS clusters exhibits two orders of modulated periodicities, which can be defined by the approximate intersections between several sets of Moiré planes. Two possible edge facets are suggested, based on the NCS distribution. Based on the misfit analysis, the dislocation structures in the edge facets were calculated. The calculated <b>orientations</b> <b>and</b> dislocation structures of the edge facets are consistent with the experimental observations...|$|R

5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, <b>orientation</b> <b>and</b> {{the status of the}} water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the eyes}} of most microbat species are small and poorly developed, leading to poor visual acuity, no species is blind.
