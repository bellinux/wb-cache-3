An adiabaticity criterion is proposed to distinguish between inelastic and quasi-elastic collisions.

40|$|Recently, {{differences}} in Doppler shifts across {{the base of}} four close classical T Tauri star jets have been detected with the HST in optical and near-ultraviolet (NUV) emission lines, and these Doppler shifts were interpreted as rotation signatures under the assumption of steady state flow. To support this interpretation, {{it is necessary that}} the underlying disks rotate in the same sense. Agreement between disk rotation and jet rotation determined from <b>optical</b> <b>lines</b> has been verified in two cases and rejected in one case. Meanwhile, the NUV lines, which may trace faster and more collimated inner spines of the jet than <b>optical</b> <b>lines,</b> either agree or show no clear indication. We propose to perform this test on the fourth system, Th 28. We present ALMA high angular resolution Band 7 continuum, 12 CO(3 - 2) and 13 CO(2 - 1) observations of the circumstellar disk around the T Tauri star Th 28. We were able to detect, in CO and continuum, clear signatures of a disk in Keplerian rotation around Th 28. The 12 CO emission is resolved, allowing us to derive estimates of disk position angle and inclination. The large velocity separation of the peaks in 12 CO, combined with the resolved extent of the emission, indicate a central stellar mass in the range 1 - 2 Msun. The rotation sense of the disk is well detected in both 13 CO and 12 CO emission lines, and this direction is opposite to that implied by the transverse Doppler shifts measured in the <b>optical</b> <b>lines</b> of the jet. The Th 28 system is the second system where counter-rotation between the disk and the optical jet is detected. These findings imply either that optical transverse velocity gradients detected with HST do not trace jet rotation or that modeling the flow with the steady assumption is not valid. In both cases jet rotation studies that rely solely on <b>optical</b> <b>lines</b> are not suitable to derive the launching radius of the jet. Comment: 9 pages, 4 figues, accepted by A&...|$|R

30|$|There are {{two types}} of delay lines {{available}} in industry, which are based on optical technology and electronic technology. <b>Optical</b> delay <b>lines</b> offer the highest-resolution delay step, truly in the sub-picosecond range and with exceptionally linear increments. A signal is delayed by adjusting an air gap distance between an input and output fiber optic transceiver. The greater the distance a light signal travels between these two points, the longer the time delay of the output signal. However, <b>optical</b> delay <b>lines</b> offer limited delay range, which is in the order of only a few 100  ps. When an application calls for exceptionally long delays, several <b>optical</b> delay <b>lines</b> can be cascaded to extend the range with no loss in resolution and linearity (Melloni et al. 2010). However, this is achieved at the expense of system complexity since <b>optical</b> delay <b>lines</b> use fiber optic cables which make for a costly, bulky and fragile setup (Hashimoto et al. 2008). On the other hand, CMOS delay lines offer reduced system complexity and cost (Hashimoto et al. 2008; Melloni et al. 2010).|$|R
