5|$|On June 9, 2010, the MTO {{approved}} the extension as far east as Simcoe Street in Oshawa, announcing plans to phase {{construction of the}} extension. Local residents and politicians rejected the plan, as had happened with the section between McCowan Road and Markham Road. A motion was proposed in the Ontario Legislature to build the full extension in <b>one</b> <b>project,</b> but failed to pass. Instead, a compromise was issued on March 10, 2011: the first phase would extend Highway407 to Harmony Road in Oshawa by 2015, including Highway412; the second phase would then complete the extension to Highway35/ 115 by 2020, including Highway418.|$|E
5|$|In 1841, a new Master of the Mint, William Ewart Gladstone was appointed. Gladstone thought {{highly of}} Pistrucci and corresponded {{with him in}} Italian, but was unwilling to grant him any new {{commissions}} while the Waterloo Medal remained outstanding. By 1844, the continued expense of Pistrucci was a concern to the Audit Office. Gladstone restored cuts in Pistrucci's pay {{that had been made}} for failure to train an apprentice, and offered him a bonus of £400 to complete the medal. Pistrucci was to work solely on the <b>one</b> <b>project.</b> He vacated his home at the Royal Mint, moving to Old Windsor, where he set up a workshop to attempt the medal's completion. Although Pistrucci worked constantly on the medal during some periods, he was slowed by a fall in his cottage, which incapacitated him for much of 1846. On 1 January 1849, Pistrucci submitted the matrices of the medal to the Royal Mint, and was paid £1,500.|$|E

25|$|These support {{programs}} primarily focused on economic development (see below) and assistance with infrastructure, such as training civil engineers and developing the electricity system.

25|$|The architects {{invited to}} direct these {{workshops}} included traditionalists Ivan Zholtovsky, Alexey Shchusev, Ivan Fomin, Boris Iofan, Vladimir Schuko {{as well as}} practising constructivists: Ilya Golosov, Panteleimon Golosov, Nikolai Kolli, Konstantin Melnikov, Victor Vesnin, Moisei Ginzburg and Nikolai Ladovsky. This began an important trend that lasted until 1955. Stalin chose Iofan for <b>one</b> <b>project,</b> but retained all competing architects in his employ.|$|E
25|$|Other South American {{countries}} are contemplating {{other ways to}} secure gas supplies: <b>one</b> <b>project</b> aims at linking the Camisea gas reserves in Peru to Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay.

The other specifications {{are the same as}} in Table  8. The consistently positive and significant coefficients across different specifications indicate that the impact of Yigong-daizhen projects is larger in villages with higher program intensity, i.e., more number of projects.|$|R

25|$|When the {{objective}} is to maximize total value, the calculated IRR should not be used to choose between mutually exclusive projects. In cases where <b>one</b> <b>project</b> has a higher initial investment than a second mutually exclusive project, the first project may have a lower IRR (expected return), but a higher NPV (increase in shareholders' wealth) and should thus be accepted over the second project (assuming no capital constraints).|$|E

25|$|The {{city and}} preservationists {{were able to}} work {{together}} on <b>one</b> <b>project,</b> the restoration of the 1899 Kirkland Hotel at Clinton Avenue and Main Street in the southeast corner of the district. A rare example of a wood-frame urban hotel, it had been vacant since the 1970s.

BHP had better success with the giant Escondida copper mine in Chile (57.5 per cent owned) and the EKATI Diamond Mine in northern Canada. which it divested in 2013 to Dominion Diamond Corporation (formerly Harry Winston Diamond Corporation).|$|E
5000|$|The {{effect can}} be {{experimentally}} demonstrated as follows. A display called a [...] "Mondrian" [...] (after Piet Mondrian whose paintings are similar) consisting of numerous colored patches is shown to a person. The display is illuminated by three white lights, <b>one</b> <b>projected</b> through a red filter, <b>one</b> <b>projected</b> through a green filter, and <b>one</b> <b>projected</b> through a blue filter. The person is asked to adjust {{the intensity of the}} lights so that a particular patch in the display appears white. The experimenter then measures the intensities of red, green, and blue light reflected from this white-appearing patch. Then the experimenter asks the person to identify the color of a neighboring patch, which, for example, appears green. Then the experimenter adjusts the lights so that the intensities of red, blue, and green light reflected from the green patch are the same as were originally measured from the white patch. The person shows color constancy in that the green patch continues to appear green, the white patch continues to appear white, and all the remaining patches continue to have their original colors.|$|R

The National Infrastructures Ministry announced on December 2009 on expanding the feed-in tariff scheme to include medium-sized solar-power stations ranging from 50 kilowatts to 5 megawatts, though only <b>one</b> <b>project</b> was approved by June 2010.|$|E
25|$|In spring 1987, {{construction}} on the $8million Phase <b>One</b> <b>project</b> to connect the two sections of Ohio River Boulevard together began from Western Avenue to Allegheny Avenue. In January 1988, Phase Two of the project began, which consisted of a new interchange between the expressway and the West End Bridge. The bridge would be closed for two years while it underwent rehabilitation and new ramps were built at the northern end for the interchange. The southern terminus was moved from Western Avenue to I-279 when the missing section in Ohio River Boulevard was finally completed in 1992.|$|E

25|$|Another {{project in}} the {{pipeline}} was a concert planned for 25 September 2003 at the 100 Club.

30|$|Another {{dimension}} {{to examine the}} heterogeneity of program’s impact is through the intensity of different Yigong-daizhen projects. It {{is likely that the}} impact of such projects should be larger in villages with more numbers of such projects, or more local labor participation. Therefore, we will compare the impact of Yigong-daizhen projects in villages with only <b>one</b> such <b>project</b> to the villages with more than <b>one</b> <b>projects.</b> Also, we will compare the impact in villages with below average labor participation for the Yigong-daizhen projects to the villages with above average labor participation in these projects.|$|R
