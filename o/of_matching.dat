In 1895, he founded the Carnegie Institute. In 1901, as the U.S. Steel Corporation formed, he sold his mills to J.P. Morgan for $250 million, making him one of the world's richest men. Carnegie once wrote that a man who dies rich, dies disgraced. He devoted the rest of his life to public service, establishing libraries, trusts, and foundations. In Pittsburgh, he founded the Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University) and the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.|$|E

5|$|Hershey won {{the first}} game 5–2 on April 26, with Crabb opening scoring with a power play goal, and the Bears taking a 4–0 lead by the second period, {{resulting}} in Providence goaltender Niklas Svedberg being pulled from the game. The victory marked Hershey's first game one win in a playoff series since defeating Manchester in the 2009–10 Eastern Conference finals. The Bears also won their second game 5–4 on April 28, with Grubauer making 54 saves, eight short <b>of</b> <b>matching</b> the team's playoff record. The Bruins allowed 64 shots, which were six short of Hershey's highest in a playoff game. Hershey was losing 4–3 in the third, their first time trailing in the series, but Grubauer was pulled for an extra attacker and Crabb tied the game with 91 seconds in regulation, allowing DiSalvatore to score the game-winner in overtime on a power play.

5|$|In {{order to}} achieve even higher power levels in ytterbium-based fiber systems. all factors of the fiber must be considered. These can be {{achieved}} only via optimization of all the ytterbium fiber parameters, ranging from the core background losses to the geometrical properties, {{in order to reduce}} the splice losses within the cavity. Power scaling also requires optimization <b>of</b> <b>matching</b> passive fibers within the optical cavity. The optimization of the ytterbium-doped glass itself through host glass modification of various dopants also plays a large part in reducing the background loss of the glass, improvements in slope efficiency of the fiber, and improved photodarkening performance, all of which contribute to increased power levels in 1 µm systems.|$|E
5|$|India {{experienced}} similar {{development to}} China in the Middle Ages; however, stringed instruments developed differently as they accommodated {{different styles of}} music. While stringed instruments of China were designed to produce precise tones capable <b>of</b> <b>matching</b> the tones of chimes, stringed instruments of India were considerably more flexible. This flexibility suited the slides and tremolos of Hindu music. Rhythm was of paramount importance in Indian music of the time, {{as evidenced by the}} frequent depiction of drums in reliefs dating to the Middle Ages. The emphasis on rhythm is an aspect native to Indian music. Historians divide the development of musical instruments in medieval India between pre-Islamic and Islamic periods due to the different influence each period provided.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald also {{urged the}} federal Conservative {{government}} of R. B. Bennett to increase {{financial support to}} poorer provinces. At the time, there was no national system of unemployment insurance and the Bennett Conservatives insisted that the unemployed were mainly {{the responsibility of the}} provinces and municipalities. Although the federal government did provide relief during the Depression, Nova Scotia and the two other Maritime provinces were hampered by the federal system <b>of</b> <b>matching</b> grants for relief programs. Under that system, provinces received federal money only if they were willing to contribute a percentage of their own revenues. Thus, the poorest provinces received less federal aid than the richer ones because they couldn't afford to match the federal grants. Historian E. R. Forbes points out for example, that from January to May 1935, all three levels of government spent an average of $2.84 for each relief recipient in the Maritimes, an amount less than half the $6.18 spent in the other six provinces.|$|E
40|$|There is {{a pile of}} n ∈ Z + matches on the table. Players in turn pick 1, 2 or 3 matches until no matches remain. The {{player who}} at this time has an odd number <b>of</b> <b>matches</b> wins the game. (i) Who wins the game for n = 15 ? When the game starts, both players possess an even number <b>of</b> <b>matches,</b> namely 0. Important to note is that each {{successive}} turn in the game depends on wheter the active player has an odd or even number <b>of</b> <b>matches.</b> In fact, {{it turns out that}} this property, together with the number <b>of</b> remaining <b>matches,</b> completely determines the next step by the active player (that is, how many matches to pick); if a winning strategy for this player exists at all. This allows us to create a table that correlates these two game state properties with the number <b>of</b> <b>matches</b> that should be picked next. See Table 1. This table was created assuming that the total number <b>of</b> <b>matches</b> in the game is odd. The value for l indicates the number <b>of</b> <b>matches</b> left on the table. ”Odd ” and ”Even ” indicate what the active player should do if he possesses an odd or even number <b>of</b> <b>matches</b> respectively.

5|$|The George VI Victorian Suite was {{originally}} a wedding present by George VI {{to his daughter}} Elizabeth in 1947. The suite consists of a long necklace of oblong sapphires and diamonds and a pair <b>of</b> <b>matching</b> square sapphire earrings also bordered with diamonds. The suite {{was originally}} made in 1850. The stones exactly matched the colour of the robes of the Order of the Garter, although {{this may have been}} a coincidence on George's part. Elizabeth had the necklace shortened by removing the biggest sapphire in 1952, and later had a new pendant made using the removed stone. In 1963, a new sapphire and diamond tiara and bracelet were made to match the original pieces. The tiara is made out of a necklace that had belonged to Princess Louise of Belgium, daughter of Leopold II. In 1969, the Queen wore the complete parure to a charity concert.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} feature of Zobel network filters {{is that they}} have a constant resistance image impedance and for this reason are also known as constant resistance networks. Clearly, the Zobel network filter does not have a problem matching to its terminations and this is its main advantage. However, other filter types have steeper transfer functions and sharper cut-offs. In filtering applications, the main role of Zobel networks is as equalisation filters. Zobel networks are in a different group from other image filters. The constant resistance means that when used in combination with other image filter sections the same problem <b>of</b> <b>matching</b> arises as with end terminations. Zobel networks also suffer the disadvantage of using far more components than other equivalent image sections.|$|E

Before fitting the valve the thread type must be checked to ensure that a valve with matching thread specification is fitted.|$|E
