By 1952 the net profit was £146,318 (tax: £347,000) and in 1953 the respective figures were £228,583 and £449,000.

5|$|Both Wessex's sudden rise {{to power}} in the late 820s, and the {{subsequent}} failure to retain this dominant position, have been examined by historians looking for underlying causes. One plausible explanation for the events <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>years</b> is that Wessex's fortunes were to some degree dependent on Carolingian support. The Franks supported Eardwulf when he recovered the throne of Northumbria in 808, so it is plausible that they also supported Ecgberht's accession in 802. At Easter 839, not long before Ecgberht's death, he was in touch with Louis the Pious, king of the Franks, to arrange safe passage to Rome. Hence a continuing relationship with the Franks seems {{to be part of}} southern English politics {{during the first half of}} the ninth century.|$|E
5|$|Dougan {{represented}} Northern Ireland at schoolboy, youth, amateur and 'B' {{level as}} a wing-half and centre-defender. He made his senior international debut under Peter Doherty in 1–0 win over Czechoslovakia during the 1958 FIFA World Cup on 8 June 1958. He had won nine caps before he joined Peterborough in 1962, when the drop to Third Division football left {{him out of}} international contention {{for the next three}} years. Bertie Peacock returned him to the team following his transfer to First Division Leicester City in 1965, and he missed just three of the next 37 internationals. He was named as captain when Terry Neill succeeded Billy Bingham as manager in 1971. He made his final appearance for Northern Ireland on 14 February 1973 in a 1974 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Cyprus. He won a total of 43 senior caps and scored eight goals in a 15-year international career, but despite playing alongside George Best for nine <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>years</b> Northern Ireland did not qualify for a major tournament after the 1958 FIFA World Cup.|$|E

25|$|This {{new state}} Constitution {{was the major}} {{political}} development <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>years.</b> With the new U.S. Constitution in place, {{it was necessary to}} revise the somewhat experimental Delaware Constitution of 1776.

25|$|In 1983, the {{economic}} situation began to improve. Boeing assembled its 1,000th 737 passenger aircraft. During the following years, commercial aircraft and their military versions became the basic equipment of airlines and air forces. As passenger air traffic increased, competition was harder, mainly from Airbus, a European newcomer in commercial airliner manufacturing. Boeing had to offer new aircraft, and developed the single-aisle 757, the larger, twin-aisle 767, and upgraded versions of the 737. An important project <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>years</b> was the Space Shuttle, to which Boeing contributed with its experience in space rockets acquired during the Apollo era.

The Boys from Brooklyn, as they were referred to, finished the 1901 season with a 13–1 mark. From the 1902 to the 1920 season the Terrier basketball records are incomplete.
