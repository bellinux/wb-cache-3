It is a major pest in cotton and one of the most polyphagous and cosmopolitan pest species. It should not be confused with the similarly named, related species Helicoverpa zea.|$|R
40|$|Since its {{detection}} in Brazil in 2013, the <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> cotton <b>bollworm</b> Helicoverpa armigera {{has been}} reported in Argentina, Paraguay, and Bolivia. Here we present evidence extending the South American range of H. armigera to Uruguay, using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing of the partial mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase I region. Molecular characterization of this gene region from individuals from Paraguay also supports previous morphological identification of H. armigera in Paraguay. Shared mtDNA haplotypes in H. armigera from Brazil, Uruguay, and Paraguay were identified. Additional surveying of populations in this region will be imperative to better monitor and understand factors that are underpinning its presence and successful adaptation in these South American regions. We discuss our findings with respect to the development of resistance pest management strategies of this invasive insect pest in a predominantly monoculture soybean crop landscape in the Southern Cone region...|$|R
40|$|The highly {{polyphagous}} <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> cotton <b>bollworm</b> Helicoverpa armigera is a quarantine agricultural pest for the American continents. Historically H. armigera {{is thought}} to have colonised the American continents around 1. 5 to 2 million years ago, leading to the current H. zea populations on the American continents. The relatively recent species divergence history is evident in mating compatibility between H. zea and H. armigera under laboratory conditions. Despite periodic interceptions of H. armigera into North America, this pest species is not believed to have successfully established significant populations on either continent. In this study, we provide molecular evidence via mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cyt b) partial gene sequences for the successful recent incursion of H. armigera into the New World, with individuals being detected at two sites (Primavera do Leste, Pedra Preta) within the State of Mato Grosso in Brazil. The mtDNA COI and Cyt b haplotypes detected in the Brazilian H. armigera individuals are common throughout the <b>Old</b> <b>World,</b> thus precluding identification of the founder populations. Combining the two partial mtDNA gene sequences showed that at least two matrilines are present in Brazil, while the inclusion of three nuclear DNA Exon-Primed Intron-Crossing (EPIC) markers identified a further two possible matrilines in our samples. The economic, biosecurity, resistance management, ecological and evolutionary implications of this incursion are discussed in relation to the current agricultural practices in the Americas.

40|$|African {{bollworm}} or <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>bollworm</b> (Helicoverpa armigera Hubner, Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is {{an extremely}} polyphagous and major pest of many crops in Botswana. The damage to most crops results in reduction of yields. H. armigera is estimated to cause yield loss of 15 to 30 % on sorghum in Botswana. Despite its importance, research on H. armigera has not been carried out in Botswana since 1979. This paper reviews the research on management of H. armigera that was undertaken in Botswana from the late sixties to late seventies (1967 to 1979). The research focused on developing various pest management methods that would be packaged into an integrated pest management strategy to manage H. armigera in field crops. The major findings were that microbial control (using nuclear polyhedrosis virus and Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner), enhancing natural enemies, cultural control {{and the use of}} insecticides had potential in management of H. armigera. These findings are discussed in comparison with other studies done in Asia, Australia and other parts of Africa where African bollworm is a major pest of field crops. The primary objective {{of this paper is to}} review the research that had been undertaken on H. armigera in Botswana and propose future research needs and directions...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>bollworm</b> Helicoverpa armigera is now {{established}} in Brazil but efforts to identify incursion origin(s) and pathway(s) {{have met with}} limited success due to the patchiness of available data. Using international agricultural/horticultural commodity trade data and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome oxidase I (COI) and cytochrome b (Cyt b) gene markers, we inferred the origins and incursion pathways into Brazil. We detected 20 mtDNA haplotypes from six Brazilian states, eight of which were new to our 97 global COI-Cyt b haplotype database. Direct sequence matches indicated five Brazilian haplotypes had Asian, African, and European origins. We identified 45 parsimoniously informative sites and multiple substitutions per site within the concatenated (945 [*]bp) nucleotide dataset, implying that probabilistic phylogenetic analysis methods are needed. High diversity and signatures of uniquely shared haplotypes with diverse localities combined with the trade data suggested multiple incursions and introduction origins in Brazil. Increasing agricultural/horticultural trade activities between the Old and New Worlds represents a significant biosecurity risk factor. Identifying pest origins will enable resistance profiling that reflects countries of origin to be included when developing a resistance management strategy, while identifying incursion pathways will improve biosecurity protocols and risk analysis at biosecurity hotspots including national ports.

40|$|Abstract: The {{corn earworm}} Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) and the <b>old</b> <b>world</b> <b>bollworm</b> Helicoverpa armigera (Hubner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) are {{allopatric}} species and occur in important agricultural crops. In maize, both species tend to infest the ear. The introduction of H. armigera in Brazil {{has created a}} new scenario, where these Helicoverpa species might cohabit and interact with one another, affecting the prevalence of each species in the agroecosystem, integrated pest management, and insect resistance management. In this study, larval occurrence and proportion of these species in maize was assessed in three regions of Brazil during three crop seasons. Interaction between the species was evaluated in interspecific and intraspecific scenarios under laboratory and field conditions. Helicoverpa zea was predominant in Rio Grande do Sul and the Planaltina, DF (central Brazil). In western Bahia, H. zea was predominant in the first collection, but approximately equal in number to H armigera in the second crop season. Both species exhibit high cannibalism/predation rates, and larval size was the primary factor for larval survival in the interaction studies. Larva of H. zea had higher survival when interacting with H. armigera, indicating that H. zea has an advantage in intraguild interactions with H. armigera in maize. Overall, the results from this study indicate that maize might play a role as a source of infestation or a sink of insecticide or Bt protein unselected H. armigera populations, depending on the H. zea: H. armigera intraguild competition and adult movement in the landscape. 201...|$|E
50|$|In November 2009, Monsanto {{scientists}} found the pink bollworm had become resistant to first-generation Bt cotton {{in parts of}} Gujarat, India - that generation expresses one Bt gene, Cry1Ac. This was the first instance of Bt resistance confirmed by Monsanto anywhere in the <b>world.</b> <b>Bollworm</b> resistance to first generation Bt cotton has been identified in Australia, China, Spain, and the United States. In 2012, a Florida field trial demonstrated that army worms were resistant to pesticide-containing GM corn produced by Dupont-Dow; armyworm resistance was first discovered in Puerto Rico in 2006, prompting Dow and DuPont to voluntarily stop selling the product on the island.|$|R

40|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>bollworm,</b> Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), and {{the corn}} earworm, H. zea (Boddie), {{are two of}} the most {{important}} agricultural pests in the world. Diagnosing these two species is difficult-adults can only be separated with a complex dissection, and larvae cannot be identified to species using morphology, necessitating the use of geographic origin for identification in most instances. With the discovery of H. armigera in the New World, identification of immature Helicoverpa based on origin is no longer possible because H. zea also occurs in all of the geographic regions where H. armigera has been discovered. DNA barcoding and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses have been reported in publications to distinguish these species, but these methods both require post-PCR processing (i. e., DNA sequencing or restriction digestion) to complete. We report the first real-time PCR assay to distinguish these pests based on two hydrolysis probes that bind to a segment of the internal transcribed spacer region 2 (ITS 2) amplified using a single primer pair. One probe targets H. armigera, the second probe targets H. zea, and a third probe that targets a conserved segment of 18 S rDNA is used as a control of DNA quality. The assay can be completed in 50 minutes when using isolated DNA and is successfully tested on larvae intercepted at ports of entry and adults captured during domestic surveys. We demonstrate that the assay can be run in triplex with no negative effects on sensitivity, can be run using alternative real-time PCR reagents and instruments, and does not cross react with other New World Heliothinae...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>bollworm,</b> Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner), was {{recently}} introduced into Brazil, {{where it has}} caused extensive damage to cotton and soybean crops. MON 87701 × MON 89788 soybean, which expresses the Bt protein Cry 1 Ac, {{was recently}} deployed in Brazil, providing high levels of control against H. armigera. To assess the risk {{of resistance to the}} Cry 1 Ac protein expressed by MON 87701 × MON 89788 soybean in Brazil, we conducted studies to evaluate the baseline susceptibility of H. armigera to Cry 1 Ac, in planta efficacy including the assessment of the high-dose criterion, and the initial resistance allele frequency based on an F 2 screen. The mean Cry 1 Ac lethal concentration (LC 50) ranged from 0. 11 to 1. 82 μg·mL- 1 of diet among all H. armigera field populations collected from crop seasons 2013 / 14 to 2014 / 15, which indicated about 16. 5 -fold variation. MON 87701 × MON 89788 soybean exhibited a high level of efficacy against H. armigera and most likely met the high dose criterion against this target species in leaf tissue dilution bioassays up to 50 times. A total of 212 F 2 family lines of H. armigera were established from field collections sampled from seven locations across Brazil and were screened for the presence of MON 87701 × MON 89788 soybean resistance alleles. None of the 212 families survived on MON 87701 × MON 89788 soybean leaf tissue (estimated allele frequency = 0. 0011). The responses of H. armigera to Cry 1 Ac protein, high susceptibility to MON 87701 × MON 89788 soybean, and low frequency of resistance alleles across the main soybean-producing regions support the assumptions of a high-dose/refuge strategy. However, maintenance of reasonable compliance with the refuge recommendation will be essential to delay the evolution of resistance in H. armigera to MON 87701 × MON 89788 soybean in Brazil...|$|E
40|$|The use of radar to make direct {{observations}} of insects flying at altitude has provided many {{new insights into}} the phenomenon of long-range insect migration. In particular, the technique has produced a wealth of quantitative information on the spatial and temporal distribution of migrants in the air, on the direction, speed and duration of their displacements, and on their orientation behaviour. These data could not have been obtained by any other means, and it is probably fair to claim that our present knowledge of the magnitude and importance of high altitude insect movement stems very largely from radar observations. The pioneering field studies using the first specially designed entomological radar were undertaken in 1968, {{with the support of the}} UK Overseas Development Administration (ODA), and since that time ODA has been responsible for funding almost all of the applications of the technique in developing countries. The motivation for this work was the assumption that it was impossible to design efficient management strategies for migrant pest insects without a good knowledge of their migratory behaviour, and of the role which this played in their population dynamics. The ODA-funded studies thus focused primarily on pest species, and were carried out by the Radar Entomology Unit of the Natural Resources Institute (NRI) and its precursors. In this Bulletin, we give a brief account of the history of radar entomology, with emphasis on studies of insect pests. Next, the different types of entomological radar and some associated analysis methods are outlined, together with descriptions of some ancillary measurement techniques. We then describe in some detail the contributions made by the NRI Radar Unit to current knowledge of the flight patterns of a variety of major insect pests of agriculture and of human health. These pests include: grasshoppers and locusts, the African Armyworm moth, the Rice Brown Planthopper and other rice pests, the <b>Old</b> <b>World</b> <b>Bollworm,</b> and some mosquito vectors of human diseases. Recent developments directed towards long-term monitoring of insect aerial faunas (for environmental impact, biodiversity and conservation purposes), and towards observations of low-altitude flight, are included. The Bulletin concludes with a short overview, in which we speculate how the technique might find application in the future...|$|E
