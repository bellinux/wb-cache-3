50|$|When Rollin White's {{request of}} {{extension}} for his breech-loading revolvers patent {{was rejected by}} the American Government in January 1870 the Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company started working on its own metallic cartridge rear-loaders. Up until then, it had been only practicing the so-called Richards-Mason conversions. The Colt company continued converting muzzle-loading percussion revolvers into rear-loaders until 1878, but in 1871 Colt's had patented at least two rear-loading revolvers using metallic cartridges: the Colt House Revolver and the <b>Open</b> <b>Top.</b> The <b>House</b> revolver went into production the same year in 1871 but the <b>Open</b> <b>Top</b> didn't start production until 1872, although a pocket version of the <b>Open</b> <b>Top,</b> a completely different design, went on sale as of 1871, the Colt <b>Open</b> <b>Top</b> Pocket Model Revolver.|$|R

The housing system significantly influenced the body weight at 11 weeks of age (2630 vs 2557 g: in cage or pen, respectively) and the feed conversion (3. 12 vs 3. 38 g/g; in cage or pen, respectively).

Some of the live performance traits of rabbits reared in pens was slightly lower. The presence of gnawing stick, especially in pens, reduced the aggressive behaviour and improved the welfare...|$|R

50|$|The Colt House Revolver (also called, in its {{alternate}} 4-round capacity model, the Cloverleaf) {{was one of}} {{the first}} metallic cartridge rear-loading revolvers to be produced by the Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company, back in 1871.

40|$|This 2 x 2 x 2 {{factorial}} experiment {{was conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} housing system (pair caged - cage - : 2 rabbits/ 0. 122 m(2) vs <b>open</b> <b>top</b> pen <b>housed</b> - pen - : 13 rabbits/ 0. 86 m(2); same stocking density), floor type (wire mesh vs plastic net), and environmental enrichment (with vs without gnawing stick) on the meat quality of Pannon White growing rabbits (n = 64). The housing system significantly influenced slaughter weight (2590 vs 2531 g in cage or pen, respectively; P< 0. 01), reference carcass (RC) weight (1266 vs 1234 g; in cage or pen, respectively; P< 0. 05), and the hind leg meat to bone ratio (6. 11 vs 5. 62 in cage or pen, respectively, P< 0. 001). The animals reared in pens showed paler meat with lower pH(u) than that of those reared paired in cages. Hind leg meat dry matter and protein content were also influenced by the housing system (26. 3 vs 25. 9 %, 21. 9 vs 21. 6 %; in cage or pen. respectively; P< 0. 05). Pen housed rabbits had significantly heavier femur and tibia bone weight and higher fracture toughness than pair caged rabbits. Floor type affected the fore part/RC weight ratio (29. 2 vs 29. 6 % of the RC on plastic net or wire mesh, respectively). Gnawing stick presence increased slaughter yield (59. 0 vs 58. 3 %: P< 0. 05), RC weight (1266 vs 1236 g; P< 0. 05) and the forepart/RC ratio (29. 6 vs 29. 2 % RC; P< 0. 05) while significantly reducing the meat colour b* value and increasing m. Longissimus dorsi shear force (0. 60 vs 0. 50 kg/cm(2) : p< 0. 01). The hind leg meat fatty acid profile was only slightly influenced by experimental factors. Although this study showed pair caged rabbits to have increased carcass weight with better meatiness and other meat quality traits, hind leg bone strength was shown to be higher in pen housed rabbits...|$|R

50|$|Nearly {{all major}} {{cities in the}} United Kingdom are served by tour bus services, most using <b>open</b> <b>top</b> buses. Other picturesque rural areas and monuments are also served by <b>open</b> <b>top</b> tours, such as Stonehenge and the New Forest.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the first}} {{operators}} to provide <b>open</b> <b>top</b> buses for its seaside routes was Brighton, Hove & District in 1936. While most operators rebuilt old vehicles for such services, Maidstone & District Motor Services purchased six new Leyland Tiran TD5s with <b>open</b> <b>top</b> bodies built by Weymann in 1939. World War II saw an end to leisure services for a while, for example it was 1949 before <b>open</b> <b>top</b> services resumed at Southend-on-Sea. As new buses became available for regular services more companies introduced new <b>open</b> <b>top</b> services using old buses with their roofs cut off, such as at the Bristol Omnibus Company at Weston-super-Mare in 1950 and Devon General at Torquay in 1955.|$|R

5000|$|The Colt Model 1871-72 <b>Open</b> <b>Top</b> is a {{metallic}} cartridge rear-loading [...]44-caliber revolver introduced in 1872 by the Colt's Patent Fire Arms Manufacturing Company.

There is therefore still some confusion when naming it. It is sometimes named Colt Model 1871 or Colt Model 1872 but at this time the most common accepted names are Colt Model 1871-72 <b>Open</b> <b>Top,</b> Colt Model 1871-72 or simply Colt <b>Open</b> <b>Top.</b>|$|R
