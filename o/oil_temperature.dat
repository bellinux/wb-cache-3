25|$|Most {{in-flight}} shutdowns are harmless {{and likely}} to go unnoticed by passengers. For example, it may be prudent for the flight crew to shut down an engine and perform a precautionary landing {{in the event of}} a low oil pressure or high <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> warning in the cockpit. However, passengers in a jet powered aircraft may become quite alarmed by other engine events such as a compressor surge — a malfunction that is typified by loud bangs and even flames from the engine’s inlet and tailpipe. A compressor surge is a disruption of the airflow through a gas turbine jet engine that can be caused by engine deterioration, a crosswind over the engine’s inlet, ingestion of foreign material, or an internal component failure such as a broken blade. While this situation can be alarming, the engine may recover with no damage.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of McCairns missions were successful. Perhaps his most dangerous mission {{was on the}} night of 14/15 April 1943 when an operator choose a field near Amboise that did not have a clear flare path. As he came in for his landing approach he struck a twelve-foot-tall poplar tree. McCairns asked the operator what the damage was and he was told none, only the radio aerial had been torn away. Without climbing down to inspect the damage for himself, McCairns took aboard his passengers and took off. He soon realised he had a more serious problem. The stick was shaking in his hand and his <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> was rising. Eventually the engine froze up. He began gliding down and decided they would all have to bail out. However, checking in with his passengers he was informed he was carrying four. Only having two parachutes in the back, he realized he would have to try a forced landing on the unknown ground below. With 3,000 feet to go he discovered the reason for the engine failure. The hot carburetor warmer had been knocked out of position. Once he corrected this he was able to restart the engine, and they resumed their rough flight back to RAF Tangmere. After landing it was discovered the spinner was stove in, and the tailplane had been nearly torn loose, held in place by the single remaining screw of a single bracket.|$|E

40|$|A well-designed engine {{encapsulation}} {{can extend}} engine cool-down time significantly - {{on the order}} of 500 - 700 %. This is expected to have a sensitive influence on the fuel consumption due to the increased probability for high <b>oil</b> <b>temperatures</b> at the following engine start, reduced length of the initial warm-up period and consequently, reduced friction losses. This work aims to set up and develop a simulation platform for investigations of the potential effect of thermal engine encapsulation on fuel consumption of commercial and passenger vehicles. It documents the development and validation of the methods and tools used for this purpose, and apply them to estimate the effect of various initial <b>oil</b> <b>temperatures</b> on the fuel consumption of a commercial vehicle during a cold start drive cycle. Presented is a comprehensive 1 D unsteady model verified against experimental data and supported with parallel 3 D simulations. The model contains predictive representations of engine, cooling system, oil circuit and utilizes a temperature dependent model of engine friction losses. A number of steady-state and transient simulations are performed for a 13 L Volvo FM commercial vehicle and results are compared with physical measurements. The developed 1 D and 3 D methodologies were validated and achieved satisfactory accuracy both in steady and unsteady mode of operation. Predictions of <b>oil</b> sump <b>temperature</b> development were compared to measured values to conclude that the model is fit for further use in a temperature dependent friction model. As a last step all models were unified to perform a complete vehicle simulation of a cold start drive cycle at different initial <b>oil</b> <b>temperatures</b> in order to evaluate the influence of reduced warm-up phase on fuel consumption. The simulations indicated that there is a potential of up to approx. 3 % decrease of fuel consumption as a result of increased initial engine temperatures...|$|R

As well as having a higher top speed than a regular Clio, the 16S sports wider plastic front wings, an offset bonnet vent, wider rear arches and uprated suspension and brakes, and colour-coded front mirrors and bumpers. The RSi side skirts were omitted, however.

2500|$|In 1981, {{there was}} only one {{powerplant}} available, a [...] engine that, like the L-48 base engine the previous year, produced the , but was now designated the L81.

The stainless steel exhaust manifolds and computer control system introduced on the [...] California engines the previous year were now standard, as was an auxiliary electric engine cooling fan. This, the last C3 available with a manual transmission, so equipped, had a published 0-60mph in 8.1seconds. This model year was the first corvette to use a fiberglass rear leaf spring, now a Corvette trademark. The spring saved thirty-six pounds, but was limited to base suspensions with automatic transmission. When equipped with Delco's brand new optional ETR (Electronically Tuned Receiver) radio with a digital clock, the quartz analog instrument panel clock was replaced with an <b>oil</b> <b>temperature</b> gauge. The cast aluminum wheels, optional since ’76, were now ordered on 90 percent of the cars at a cost of $428. New options included a power adjustable driver’s seat and power remote outside mirrors.

It {{is possible that the}} difference could have been less marked had the pilot made the effort to make a tighter turn. The cockpit (which?) was judged to be well laid out; controls were well harmonised and light; flying characteristics were rated as excellent and no trimming was required; initial acceleration was good in dive and climbs; and the aileron control enabled a rapid roll from one direction to the other.
