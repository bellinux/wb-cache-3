5|$|A {{wide range}} of animals and insects live in Texas. It is the home to 65 species of mammals, 213 species <b>of</b> <b>reptiles</b> and amphibians, and the {{greatest}} diversity of bird life in the United States—590 native species in all. At least 12 species have been introduced and now reproduce freely in Texas.|$|E
5|$|During the Late Permian, {{increasing}} aridity and the diversification <b>of</b> <b>reptiles</b> contributed into {{a decline}} in terrestrial temnospondyls, but semiaquatic and fully aquatic temnospondyls continued to flourish, including the large Melosaurus of Eastern Europe. Other temnospondyls, such as archegosaurids, developed long snouts and a close similarity to crocodiles, although they lacked the armor characteristic of the latter group. These temnospondyls included the largest known batrachomorph, the 9-m-long Prionosuchus of Brazil.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} common {{divisions}} <b>of</b> <b>reptiles,</b> turtles are most popular. Fifteen of the twenty-six states give them official status. The {{rest of the}} state reptiles comprise four snakes, four lizards, and three crocodilians. Eighteen states name a reptile at the species level, two a genus, and seven a subspecies.|$|E

5|$|More than 586 {{species of}} {{resident}} and migratory birds have been categorised, including the crested serpent eagle, blossom-headed parakeet {{and the red}} junglefowl — ancestor of all domestic fowl. 33 species <b>of</b> <b>reptiles,</b> seven species of amphibians, seven species of fish and 36 species of dragonflies have also been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Next, Cuvier {{identifies}} the taxonomic {{divisions of the}} group, in this case four orders <b>of</b> <b>reptiles,</b> the chelonians (tortoises and turtles), saurians (lizards), ophidians (snakes) and batracians (amphibians, now considered a separate class of vertebrates), describing each group in a single sentence. Thus the batracians {{are said to have}} a heart with a single atrium, a naked body (with no scales), and to pass with age from being fish-like to being like a quadruped or biped.|$|E
5|$|The {{water quality}} of the Big Butte Creek {{watershed}} is generally high, and it supports several species of trout and salmon. The watershed {{is also home to}} more than 152 species of birds, 63 species of mammals, 19 species <b>of</b> <b>reptiles,</b> and numerous plants. The Poverty Flats region was designated an Area of Critical Environmental Concern by the Bureau of Land Management in 1995 to protect several rare species of plants.|$|E

5|$|Three species <b>of</b> <b>reptiles</b> are {{considered}} to be threatened and two species are endangered– these are protected under the Endangered Species Act of the State of Michigan.

The copperbelly water snake is listed as threatened by the federal government, while the eastern massasauga rattlesnake is a candidate species to be included on the US endangered species list.|$|E
5|$|Writing in 1988, naturalist J. Whitfield Gibbons {{asserted}} that {{awareness of the}} conservation needs <b>of</b> <b>reptiles</b> had lagged that of large mammals and game species. However, comparison of different editions of the Golden Guide does show increasing sensitivity to U.S. reptile conservation over {{the last half of}} the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|A {{small group}} <b>of</b> <b>reptiles,</b> the diapsids, began to diversify during the Triassic, notably the dinosaurs. By the late Mesozoic, the large labyrinthodont groups that first {{appeared}} during the Paleozoic such as temnospondyls and reptile-like amphibians had gone extinct. All current major groups of sauropsids evolved during the Mesozoic, with birds first appearing in the Jurassic as a derived clade of theropod dinosaurs. Many groups of synapsids such as anomodonts and therocephalians that once comprised the dominant terrestrial fauna of the Permian also became extinct during the Mesozoic; during the Triassic, however, one group (Cynodontia) {{gave rise to the}} descendant taxon Mammalia, which survived through the Mesozoic to later diversify during the Cenozoic.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians, where {{regionally}} accessible, {{have been}} found in the river otter's diet during the spring and summer months, as indicated in many of the food habit studies. The most common amphibians recognized were frogs (Rana and Hyla). Specific species <b>of</b> <b>reptiles</b> and amphibians prey include: boreal chorus frogs (Pseudacris maculata); Canadian toads (Bufo hemiophrys); wood frogs (Rana sylvatica); bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana); green frogs (Rana clamitans); northwestern salamanders (Ambystoma gracile); Pacific giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus); rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa); and garter snakes (Thamnophis).|$|E
5|$|By 1970, {{scientists}} {{realized this}} pose was incorrect {{and could not}} have been maintained by a living animal, as it would have resulted in the dislocation or weakening of several joints, including the hips and the articulation between the head and the spinal column. The inaccurate AMNH mount inspired similar depictions in many films and paintings (such as Rudolph Zallinger's famous mural The Age <b>of</b> <b>Reptiles</b> in Yale University's Peabody Museum of Natural History) until the 1990s, when films such as Jurassic Park introduced a more accurate posture to the general public.|$|E
5|$|Dinosaurs are {{a diverse}} group <b>of</b> <b>reptiles</b> of the clade Dinosauria that first {{appeared}} during the Triassic period. Although the exact origin and timing {{of the evolution of}} dinosaurs is the subject of active research, the current scientific consensus places their origin between 231 and 243 million years ago. They became the dominant terrestrial vertebrates after the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event 201 million years ago. Their dominance continued through the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and ended when the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event led to the extinction of most dinosaur groups 66 million years ago.|$|E
