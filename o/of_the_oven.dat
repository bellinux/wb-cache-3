5|$|Abandoned {{by their}} father {{deep in a}} forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a {{gingerbread}} house and are captured by a cannibalistic witch. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy to fatten him up, and enslaves Gretel by ordering her to prepare the oven. The siblings outsmart her and incinerate her in the fire <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b> In the fifteen years that follow, Hansel and Gretel become famed witch hunters, slaying hundreds of witches. The pair find that they are somehow immune to spells and curses, but the incident in the gingerbread house has left Hansel diabetic. He needs a shot of insulin every few hours or he will get sick and die.|$|E

25|$|In a kugelrohr a {{short path}} {{distillation}} apparatus is typically used (generally {{in combination with}} a (high) vacuum) to distill high boiling (> 300°C) compounds. The apparatus consists of an oven in which the compound to be distilled is placed, a receiving portion which is outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> and a means of rotating the sample. The vacuum is normally generated by using a high vacuum pump.|$|E
25|$|Thermostats are {{sometimes}} used to regulate gas ovens. It {{consists of a}} gas-filled bulb connected to the control unit by a slender copper tube. The bulb is normally located at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b> The tube ends in a chamber sealed by a diaphragm. As the thermostat heats up, the gas expands applying pressure to the diaphragm which reduces the flow of gas to the burner.|$|E
25|$|Uneven heating in microwaved {{food can}} be {{partly due to}} the uneven {{distribution}} of microwave energy inside the oven, and {{partly due to the}} different rates of energy absorption {{in different parts of the}} food. The first problem is reduced by a stirrer, a type of fan that reflects microwave energy to different parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> as it rotates, or by a turntable or carousel that turns the food; turntables, however, may still leave spots, such as the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> which receive uneven energy distribution. The location of dead spots and hot spots in a microwave can be mapped out by placing a damp piece of thermal paper in the oven. When the water saturated paper is subjected to the microwave radiation it becomes hot enough to cause the dye to be released which will provide a visual representation of the microwaves. If multiple layers of paper are constructed in the oven with a sufficient distance between them a three-dimensional map can be created. Many store receipts are printed on thermal paper which allows this to be easily done at home.|$|E

25|$|The common {{practice}} of Diaspora Jewry is {{to burn the}} Challah; home bakers fulfill this by tossing the Challah to the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b> However, it is Halachically permitted in the Diaspora to give the separated Challah to a Kohen for consumption, and even encouraged by some Rabbinic authorities, {{with the provision that}} the Kohen has immersed in a Mikvah.

25|$|The Persians {{introduced}} a clay oven called a tanur (similar to the Indian tandoor), which had an {{opening at the}} bottom for the fire, and through which the bread was placed to be baked on the inner wall of the upper chamber from the heat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> and ashes after the flames had died down. This continued {{to be the way}} in which Yemenite Jews baked bread until modern times. The remains of clay ovens, and fragments of bread trays have been found in several archaeological excavations.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooking chamber}} {{is similar to}} a Faraday cage to prevent the waves from coming out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven.</b> Even though there is no {{continuous}} metal-to-metal contact around the rim of the door, choke connections on the door edges act like metal-to-metal contact, at the frequency of the microwaves, to prevent leakage. The oven door usually has a window for easy viewing, with a layer of conductive mesh some distance from the outer panel to maintain the shielding. Because the size of the perforations in the mesh is much less than the microwaves' wavelength (12.2 cm for the usual 2.45 GHz), microwave radiation cannot pass through the door, while visible light (with its much shorter wavelength) can.|$|E

25|$|A box cooker has a {{transparent}} glass or plastic top, {{and it may}} have additional reflectors to concentrate sunlight into the box. The top can usually be removed to allow dark pots containing food to be placed inside. One or more reflectors of shiny metal or foil-lined material may be positioned to bounce extra light into the interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> chamber. Cooking containers and the inside bottom of the cooker should be dark-colored or black. Inside walls should be reflective to reduce radiative heat loss and bounce the light towards the pots and the dark bottom, which is in contact with the pots. The box should have insulated sides. Thermal insulation for the solar box cooker must be able to withstand temperatures up to 150°C (300°F) without melting or out-gassing. Crumpled newspaper, wool, rags, dry grass, sheets of cardboard, etc. can be used to insulate the walls of the cooker. Metal pots and/or bottom trays can be darkened either with flat-black spray paint (one that is non-toxic when warmed), black tempera paint, or soot from a fire. The solar box cooker typically reaches a temperature of 150°C (300°F). This is not as hot as a standard oven, but still hot enough to cook food over a somewhat longer period of time.|$|E
500|$|A {{household}} {{demonstration of}} this technique is possible, using a microwave oven and food such as marshmallows or margarine: if the turntable is removed so that the food does not move, it will cook the fastest at the antinodes (the points at which the wave amplitude is the greatest), where it will begin to melt. The distance between two such spots is half the wavelength of the microwaves; by measuring this distance and multiplying the wavelength by the microwave frequency (usually displayed on the back <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven,</b> typically 2450MHz), the value of c can be calculated, [...] "often with less than 5% error".|$|E

2500|$|Microwave ovens heat food {{without getting}} hot themselves.

The bread, also known as naan, is shaped and then stuck to the interior wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oven</b> to bake.
