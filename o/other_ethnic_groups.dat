40|$|This is {{the first}} book to focus on how racism affects the housing choices {{available}} to black and <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> minority <b>groups</b> and how this contributes to social exclusion. Using a practical approach, the contributors analyse the implications of social exclusion, offering suggestions for good practice in the allocation of housing for black and <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> minority <b>groups.</b> 'Race', Housing and Social Exclusion shows how racism and the shortage of housing workers from black and <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> minorities constrain the choices available to these groups, thereby preventing them from having {{an active role in}} society. Each chapter investigates a different aspect of the situation that black and <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> minority <b>groups</b> face, including: their housing needs; the procedure of the allocation of housing; patterns of housing settlement of black and <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> minority groups; the employment of black and <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> minority staff in housing associations. This book also gives examples of the experiences and aspirations of black and <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> minority <b>groups</b> and relates them to subjects such as cultural differences within and among black and <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> minority <b>groups,</b> and the further social exclusion which arises from housing associations which help a specific <b>ethnic</b> minority <b>group</b> 'Race', Housing and Social Exclusion challenges existing views, which are based on broad generalisations of black and <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> minority <b>groups,</b> and also points to future policy making and strategic planning...|$|R

5|$|Kenyatta was a {{divisive}} figure; prior to Kenyan independence, {{many of its}} white settlers regarded him as an agitator and malcontent, although across Africa he gained widespread respect as an anti-colonialist. During his presidency, {{he was given the}} honorary title of Mzee and lauded as the Father of the Nation. His rulership was criticised as dictatorial and authoritarian, of favouring Kikuyu over <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups,</b> and of overseeing a growth in corruption and cronyism which have generated long-term problems for Kenya.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} two largest groups, Macedonians and Albanians, are {{sometimes}} difficult, as {{in the rest of}} the country.

Its exact size is not known because many Macedonian Roma declare themselves as belonging to <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups</b> or simply avoid censuses. However, even if official figures are underestimated, Skopje is the city in the world with the largest Roma population.|$|E

30|$|The {{standard}} errors are clustered {{at the level}} of ethnicity and geographic area. Clustering {{at the level of}} ethnicity allows for the possibility that the behavior of households originating from the same home country may be correlated due to ethnic-specific norms (Clark 2003). However, as cluster robust {{standard errors}} require the number of groups to go to infinity in order to be consistent, we choose to cluster on the interactions of the ethnicity groups reported in Table  1 and geographic area. This strategy allows for the English (or any <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group)</b> that live in London to behave differently compared to the English (or any <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>group)</b> that live in other regions. Additionally, this increases our group numbers to 31 rather than 3.|$|R

Because the census employed the method of self-identification, those who refused to identify themselves as ethnic Chinese, or had assumed the identity of <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups,</b> were recorded as non-Chinese. It is also likely that some did not identify themselves for fear of repercussions in the wake of anti-Chinese violence in 1998, as several census stated that there are around 6 to 7 millions Chinese living in Indonesia.|$|E

Alternatively, a large group calling itself Sihanaka may have migrated from Imerina into the Alaotra area, which may have already been settled by individuals of various <b>other</b> <b>ethnic</b> <b>groups,</b> in order to maintain independence from the rule of the Merina king.|$|E
