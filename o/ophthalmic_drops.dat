40|$|Terminal {{respiratory}} secretions (TRS) or ‘‘death rattle’ ’ is {{a common}} symptom in the dying patient. Current practice for the prevention and treatment of TRS {{involves the use of}} oral, sublingual, transdermal, or parenteral anticholinergic medications. A retrospective chart review of patients admitted to a hospice inpatient unit for terminal care and treated with sublingual atropine 1 % <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>drops</b> for TRS was conducted. A total of 19 of 22 patients treated with atropine had documented reduction or resolution of TRS. This study suggests that atropine 1 % <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>drops</b> administered sublingually are a reasonable option for the management of TRS.

40|$|Background Transitions between {{health care}} {{settings}} represent vulnerable periods for medical error. Discontinuation of long-term medication use may occur during {{discharge from the}} hospital to the community. Methods We performed a population-based, cohort study using administrative records from Ontario, Canada, between April 1, 1997, and September 30, 2002. We studied all residents 66 years and older with continuous use of warfarin, 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), or -blocker <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>drops</b> for 1 or more years. Those who had an overnight hospitalization for selected elective surgical procedures were compared with 2 control groups: one that had an ambulatory procedure and one that had no procedures. All groups were assessed for the outcome of failure to renew the prescription within 6 months. Results Rates of drug treatment discontinuation after overnight hospitalizations, after ambulatory procedures, and after no procedures were 11. 4 %, 7. 5 %, and 4. 8 %, respectively, in the warfarin group; 4. 0 %, 3. 9 %, and 3. 9 %, respectively, in the statin group; and 8. 4 %, 8. 9 %, and 7. 9 %, respectively, in the <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>drops</b> group. The adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 2. 6 (95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 0 - 3. 4) for discontinuation of warfarin therapy after overnight hospitalizations and 1. 6 (95 % CI, 1. 4 - 1. 7) after ambulatory procedures. In contrast, there was no increased risk of discontinuing treatment with either statins (OR for overnight hospitalization, 1. 0 [95 % CI, 0. 9 - 1. 2]; OR for ambulatory procedure, 1. 0 [95 % CI 1. 0 - 1. 1]) or <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>drops</b> (OR for overnight hospitalization, 1. 0 [95 % CI, 0. 8 - 1. 5]; OR for ambulatory procedure, 1. 1 [95 % CI, 1. 0 - 1. 2]).

40|$|A {{high-performance}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) system {{was used in the}} reversed phase mode for the determination of benzalkonium chloride (BKC) in azithromycin viscous <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>drops.</b> A Venusil-XBP(L) -C 18 (150 mm× 4. 6 mm, 5 μm) column was used at 50 °C. The mobile phase consisted of a mixture of methanol-potassium phosphate (16 : 5, v/v). Two sample preparation methods were compared. The results suggested that, compared with an extraction procedure, a deproteinization procedure was much quicker and more convenient. Using the deproteinization procedure for sample preparation, calibration curves were linear in the range 5. 0 ~ 50 μg/ml. The within-day and inter-day coefficients of variation were less than 10 %. The average recoveries were determined as 96. 70 %, 98. 52 %, and 97. 96 % at concentrations of 10. 0, 30. 0, and 50. 0 μg/ml, respectively. Variability in precision did not exceed 5 %.

40|$|Background: Topical {{anesthesia}} is a {{safe and}} cost-effective method considered as the first-choice in many procedures. Due to the physiological characteristics of eye, most of the local anesthetics cannot efficiently penetrate through the conjunctiva deep to tenon. The aim of this pilot study {{was to find a}} new form of lidocaine to give a sufficient level of anesthesia. Methods: Lidocaine Cyclodextrin complex <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>drop</b> was produced and its pharmacological properties were studied [tested] in standard temperature and pressure. 30 patients (18 males, 12 females) with the mean age of 30. 68 ± 8. 02 years enrolled in this clinical trial. All the patients were fully informed and signed the ethics committee consent forms. The patients were given tetracaine drop as the anesthetic: 3 drops separated 2 minute apart 10 min before the intervention. If we achieved a sufficient level of anesthesia, the procedure was done after. If the patient could not tolerate the procedure, the method was changed to lidocaine drop (administered after wash-out period like the first drop). The last option was conventional injection method if the patient could not tolerate the procedure with the second method either.

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} aceclofenac eye drop through excised goat cornea. Raising pH of the formulation from 6. 0 to 8. 0, effect of different preservatives or effect of viscosity enhancer decreases apparent permeability coefficient. Topical ophthalmic NSAID are used to treat ocular surface and anterior segment inflammation as well as post operative management of pain and inflammation. Aceclofenac’s unique chemical structure makes it both a potent anti inflammatory drug and lipophilic molecule that penetrates ocular tissue, ensuring relief of pain in cataract and refractive surgery and corneal abrasion. The octanol/water partition coefficient of aceclofenac drug is 1. 86 ± 0. 75. Permeation characteristics of the drug were evaluated by putting 1 ml formulation on freshly excised goat cornea fixed between donor and receptor compartments of an all-glass modified Franz diffusion cell and measuring the drug permeated in the receptor by spectrophotometry at 275 nm, after 120 min. The results suggest that aceclofenac ophthalmic solution (pH 7) containing BAC provides increased in vitro ocular availability through goat corneas. The combination of methyl paraben and propyl paraben MP–PP preservative in aceclofenac <b>ophthalmic</b> eye <b>drop</b> 0. 1 % formulated in phosphate buffer increases transcorneal permeation.

30|$|Due to the {{significant}} role meibomian glands play in providing lipids to the tear film, meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) {{is one of}} the leading causes of DED [27]. A decrease in MGD leads to an increase in the evaporation of tears from the ocular surface [28]. Meibum is secreted by the Meibomian gland, and it is a predominant source of lipids that are important for the maintenance of tear film stability [29]. DED is a common and often chronic problem, particularly in older adults. There are numerous new therapeutic approaches that are under development, including anti-inflammatory agents, secretory stimulants, and tear film stabilizers; as a result, as improved endpoints are incorporated into clinical trials, it is likely that multiple therapeutic agents will emerge in the foreseeable future [4]. One recently approved lipid based molecule for the treatment of DED is lifitegrast; it exerts its mechanism of action by preventing LFA- 1 /ICAM- 1 from interacting which prevents T cell activation and recruitment [30].

At the same time, he developed ocular symptoms including blurred vision with optic disk edema and hemorrhage in the left eye, and bilateral red eyes. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction performed on aqueous humor sample detected no viral infection. Visual field testing with a Goldmann perimeter showed central and paracentral scotomas in the left eye.
