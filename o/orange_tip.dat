25|$|Hebomoia glaucippe, {{the great}} <b>orange</b> <b>tip,</b> is a {{butterfly}} {{belonging to the}} Pieridae family, that is the yellows and whites. It {{is found in the}} Indomalaya ecozone and Wallacea.|$|E
25|$|The larva {{is green}} with two grey stripes bordered in cream {{along the sides}} and the horn at the rear end typical of sphingids. The horn is purplish red, {{changing}} to blue with an <b>orange</b> <b>tip</b> in the last instar. They feed fully exposed {{on the top of}} the host plant and rest in among a tangle of stems. Although dependent on warmth and sun, the larval stage can be as rapid as 20 days.|$|E
25|$|The {{eggs are}} laid singly {{on a wide}} range of food plants {{including}} hedge mustard (Sisybrium officinale), garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata), cuckooflower (Cardamine pratense), water-cress (Rorippa nastutium-aquaticum), charlock (Sinapis arvensis), large bitter-cress (Cardamine amara), wild cabbage (Brassica oleracea), and wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum), and so it is rarely a pest in gardens or field crops. The caterpillar is green and well camouflaged. When full grown it is green above with black warts, from which arise whitish and blackish hairs. There is a darker line along the back and a yellow line low down on the sides. Underneath the colour is whitish-grey. The spiracular line is dusky but not conspicuous, and the spiracles are blackish surrounded with yellow. There is extensive overlap with other leaf-feeding larvae of large and small whites in some wild populations (e.g. in Morocco). It is often found feeding on the same plant as the <b>orange</b> <b>tip</b> but rarely competes for food because it usually feeds on the leaves whereas the <b>orange</b> <b>tip</b> caterpillar feeds on the flowers and developing seed pods. Like other Pieris species it overwinters as a pupa. This is green in colour, and the raised parts are yellowish and brown. This is the most frequent form, but it varies through yellowish to buff or greyish, and is sometimes without markings.|$|E

500|$|The English {{zoologist}} Edward Bagnall Poulton studied animal coloration, especially camouflage. In his 1890 book The Colours of Animals, he classified {{different types}} such as [...] "special protective resemblance" [...] (where an animal looks like another object), or [...] "general aggressive resemblance" [...] (where a predator blends {{in with the}} background, enabling it to approach prey). His experiments showed that swallowtailed moth pupae were camouflaged to match the backgrounds on which they were reared as larvae. Poulton's [...] "general protective resemblance" [...] {{was at that time}} considered to be the main method of camouflage, as when Frank Evers Beddard wrote in 1892 that [...] "tree-frequenting animals are often green in colour. Among vertebrates numerous species of parrots, iguanas, tree-frogs, and the green tree-snake are examples". Beddard did however briefly mention other methods, including the [...] "alluring coloration" [...] of the flower mantis and the possibility of a different mechanism in the <b>orange</b> <b>tip</b> butterfly. He wrote that [...] "the scattered green spots upon the under surface of the wings might have been intended for a rough sketch of the small flowerets of the plant , so close is their mutual resemblance." [...] He also explained the coloration of sea fish such as the mackerel: [...] "Among pelagic fish it is common to find the upper surface dark-coloured and the lower surface white, so that the animal is inconspicuous when seen either from above or below." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Santa Rosa Police Lieutenant Paul Henry, two Sonoma County sheriff's deputies (Gelhaus and Michael Schemmel; Schemmel {{was driving}} the patrol car) were patrolling the Moorland Avenue {{neighborhood}} when they spotted Andy Lopez approximately [...] ahead carrying an airsoft replica of an AK-47 assault rifle while he was walking on Moorland, just past the corner of West Robles Avenue. The rifle {{appeared to be a}} real weapon, since it did not have the <b>orange</b> <b>tip</b> that is a legal requirement for all toy guns for import.§272.3 Approved markings.The following markings are approved by the Secretary of Commerce: }} However, airsoft and pellet rifles are exempted from the marking requirements.§272.1 Applicability.This part applies to toy, look-alike, and imitation firearms (“devices”) having the appearance, shape, and/or configuration of a firearm and produced or manufactured and entered into commerce on or after May 5, 1989, including devices modelled on real firearms manufactured, designed, and produced since 1898. This part does not apply to: }} As the sheriff's deputies approached the child from behind, Gelhaus radioed an observation of [...] "Code 20, two units" [...] at 3:13:58p.m. Schemmel activated the light bar and briefly sounded the siren as he parked the patrol vehicle, and Gelhaus exited the passenger's side, calling out to demand that Lopez drop the weapon. Lopez turned to his right, towards the deputies and the barrel allegedly began to ascend.|$|E

60|$|We may here remark, {{that the}} cases already quoted prove clearly that either {{male or female}} may be {{modified}} in colour apart from the opposite sex. In Pieris pyrrha and its allies the male retains the usual type of coloration of the whole genus, while the female has acquired a distinct and peculiar style of colouring. In Adolias dirtea, on the other hand, the female appears to retain something like the primitive colour and markings of the two sexes, modified perhaps for more perfect protection; while the male has acquired more and more intense and brilliant colours, only showing his original markings by the few small yellow spots that remain near {{the base of the}} wings. In the more gaily coloured Pieridae, of which our orange-tip butterfly may be taken as a type, we see in the female the plain ancestral colours of the group, while the male has acquired the brilliant <b>orange</b> <b>tip</b> to its wings, probably as a recognition mark.|$|E

And a calculation of the middle verse in the Bible, and the longest verse, and the shortest verse, and the like edifying Scriptural researches, all copied out like flies' legs, in writing no one can see but Julius with his spectacles off, and set in a brooch as big as the top of a thimble, all done by a one-legged sergeant of marines. So that the line might not be out done, I offered my sergeant-major's banner-screen, but I am sorry to say they declined it, which made me jealous." ...|$|E
