5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{begins its}} breeding season {{later in the}} year than any other finch and later than any other native North American bird, besides <b>occasionally</b> <b>the</b> sedge wren. This {{may be related to the}} abundance of seeds in the late summer months, as seeds represent the majority of their diet.|$|E
5|$|The remora Remora australis and <b>occasionally</b> <b>the</b> amphipod Cyamus balaenopterae {{can also}} be found on fin whales, both feeding on the skin. Infestations of the giant {{nematode}} Crassicauda boopis can cause inflammation of the renal arteries and potential kidney failure, while the smaller C. crassicauda infects the lower urinary tract.|$|E
5|$|Almost every {{episode of}} Dexter's Laboratory {{is divided into}} three {{different}} stories/segments, each one being approximately 8 minutes in length. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>the</b> middle segment centered on characters from the Dexter's Laboratory universe other than Dexter and his family. Two of these segments were shown primarily during the first season: Dial M for Monkey and The Justice Friends. Dial M for Monkey was the middle segment for the first six episodes of season one, and The Justice Friends took its place {{for the rest of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{are both}} monogamous and polygamous; although broods are generally {{brought up by}} one male and one female, <b>occasionally</b> <b>the</b> pair may have an extra helper. Pairs {{may be part of}} a colony, in which case several other nests may occupy the same or nearby trees. Males may mate with a second female while the first is still on the nest. The reproductive success of the bird is poorer in the second nest {{than it is in the}} primary nest and is better when the male remains monogamous.|$|E
5|$|Following the Elliot Minor tour, {{the group}} began writing {{material}} for their debut album. In late November and early December, the band went {{on their first}} headlining tour of the UK, with support from Flood of Red. During the latter month, the band wrote further material. All of the songs on the album were written and arranged by themselves. Typically, Helyer or Franceschi would have an idea that the band would then flesh out together. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>the</b> band would record demos and change sections of them.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the finding}} of a {{combination}} of a low pituitary hormone together with a low hormone from the effector gland is indicative of hypopituitarism. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>the</b> pituitary hormone may be normal but the effector gland hormone decreased; in this case, the pituitary is not responding appropriately to effector hormone changes, and the combination of findings is still suggestive of hypopituitarism.|$|E

5|$|In various {{sections}} of the game, the player can ride a Triumph motorcycle, or a snowmobile. Other segments of the game involve boss fights. If the player chooses to be sneaky, they can overhear humorous conversations between non-player characters, such as guards, scientists and civilians. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>the</b> player can engage in conversations with such characters. In certain cutscenes, the game uses a dialog tree, in which the player can choose between different questions and responses when talking to another character.|$|E
5|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{radioactive}} lanthanum were dispersed by the explosions; 254 tests were performed between 1944 and 1961. In 1948 two workers received radiation burns there. The experiments were generally performed {{when the wind}} blew to the north, but <b>occasionally</b> <b>the</b> wind would change direction in the early morning. In 1949 and 1950 the nuclear fallout from the tests was blown over parts of the housing area and a road; the radiation levels on the road occasionally reached 5-10mR/h and the road had to be closed for a while.|$|E
5|$|Levels contain many {{different}} environment types, including cities, forests, and bogs. At {{the end of}} most levels, the player collects an item called a core or a shard; <b>occasionally,</b> <b>the</b> level begins to disintegrate once the Kid takes the item, forcing him to hastily retreat. As the player progresses through the levels, a voice narrates their actions. This narration gives scripted plot information as well as dynamic comments, such as on the player's skill with a weapon or performance while fighting enemies.|$|E

5|$|Like {{all species}} {{remaining}} in the genus Collybia, C.cirrhata is saprobic, and is typically found growing on the decaying or blackened remains of other mushrooms; <b>occasionally</b> <b>the</b> fruit bodies may be found growing on moss or soil without any apparent connection to decaying mushrooms, although these observations may represent instances where the remnant host tissue—possibly from a previous season—has decayed {{to such an extent}} that it remains as buried fragments in the substrate. Known hosts include Lactarius, Russula, Meripilus giganteus, and Bovista dermoxantha.|$|E
5|$|Most of Caragiale's prose is {{interconnected}} through {{allusions to}} himself, and, <b>occasionally,</b> <b>the</b> narratives discreetly refer to one another. Although his texts {{are characterized by}} precision in defining the moment and location for the plot, the general lines of the narratives are often subject to a calculated fragmentation, an innovative technique which, Vartic writes, attests the author's familiarity with Antoine Furetière's vision. Vartic also indicates that Balzac's La Comédie humaine, in particular its Thirteen cycle—which {{is known to have}} been one of the books Caragiale treasured most—, influenced the general structure of his stories.|$|E
5|$|PID {{can cause}} {{scarring}} inside the reproductive system, which can later cause serious complications, including chronic pelvic pain, infertility, ectopic pregnancy (the {{leading cause of}} pregnancy-related deaths in adult females), and other complications of pregnancy. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>the</b> infection can spread to in the peritoneum causing inflammation {{and the formation of}} scar tissue on the external surface of the liver (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome).|$|E

5|$|The Pipe rolls {{from the}} 13th century onwards are less {{important}} for historical study {{because there are}} other surviving financial records. Some, such as the receipt rolls, were also kept by the exchequer, and were used by the treasury clerks to prepare the Pipe rolls. Other surviving records were kept by the sheriffs for their own use in submitting accounts to the Pipe rolls. However the post 13th-century Pipe rolls are <b>occasionally</b> <b>the</b> sole source for historical facts such as William Shakespeare's residence in the parish of St Helen's Bishopsgate, and in Southwark.|$|E
5|$|The {{degrees of}} DLitt., DSc, DEng, LLD and DMus, whilst having {{regulations}} specifying {{the grounds for}} award, are most often conferred as honorary degrees (in honoris causa). Those used most commonly are the DLitt, DSc and LLD, with the MA (and <b>occasionally</b> <b>the</b> MLitt) also sometimes conferred honorarily for distinction in the local area or within the University.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{symptoms}} of pituitary apoplexy {{are related to}} the increased pressure in and around the pituitary gland. The most common symptom, in over 95% of cases, is a sudden-onset headache located behind the eyes or around the temples. It is often associated with nausea and vomiting. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>the</b> presence of blood leads to irritation of the lining of the brain, which may cause neck rigidity and intolerance to bright light, as well as a decreased level of consciousness. This occurs in 24% of cases.|$|E

The programme came 80th in the British Film Institute's 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. The series, originally shown on BBC One, is now available on DVD and is regularly repeated in the United Kingdom. Four episodes were remade for BBC Radio 2 The series inspired a novel published in 1992 featuring the most memorable moments from the first two series and the first Christmas special.|$|E
5|$|The slouch hat was the {{preferred}} choice of many soldiers, including officers. The hat was normally a floppy, wide brimmed, woolen body head-cover, meant {{to protect the}} individual from the sun, and inclement weather. It was normally a civilian hat, of brown, gray, or black wool. This simple hat saw widespread use throughout the Confederate Armies, and even with U.S. Army personnel. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>the</b> hat was adorned with insignia of the wearer's preference, {{and may have been}} pinned up for the drill {{in the use of the}} regular weapon of the time, the Rifled-musket.|$|E
5|$|Their songs can be {{confused}} with the Kentucky warbler. The song patterns are similar, but is of a different quality, as the warbler's songs is described as richer, with more ringing and a hurried pace. Other bird species that have their songs described as akin to the wrens are the flicker, Baltimore oriole, gray catbird, and more specifically the peto, peto, peto calls of the tufted titmouse, and whistles of the northern cardinal. <b>Occasionally,</b> <b>the</b> wrens mimic other species, and in Pennsylvania it has led for it to be also known as the 'mocking wren'.|$|E
