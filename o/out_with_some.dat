5|$|With {{the ending}} of the oppressive State Security Law period in 2000, Rajab was able to begin working openly in the field of Human rights as {{one of the founders of}} the Bahrain Human Rights Society, one of the first human rights {{organizations}} in Bahrain. He subsequently fell <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> of the other founders. In 2002, following wide ranging political reforms by the Bahraini government which allowed independent human rights groups to operate, Rajab worked with Abdulhadi al-Khawaja and others to found the Bahrain Centre for Human Rights (BCHR), a nonprofit non-governmental organization which works to promote human rights in Bahrain. Rajab was Training Program Officer and Senior Researcher at BCHR. He later became Vice President and Head of International Relations until he later took over from Abdulhadi Alkhawaja as BCHR president, a position he still held as of August 2012. In 2011 he along with other found the Gulf Center for Human Rights. Rajab became the president of the newly found rights group.|$|E
5|$|Back in England, {{early in}} 1262, Edward fell <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> {{of his former}} Lusignan allies over {{financial}} matters. The next year, King Henry sent him on a campaign in Wales against Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, with only limited results. Around the same time, Simon de Montfort, who {{had been out of}} the country since 1261, returned to England and reignited the baronial reform movement. It was at this pivotal moment, as the King seemed ready to resign to the barons' demands, that Edward began {{to take control of the}} situation. Whereas he had so far been unpredictable and equivocating, from this point on he remained firmly devoted to protecting his father's royal rights. He reunited with some of the men he had alienated the year before – among them his childhood friend, Henry of Almain, and John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey – and retook Windsor Castle from the rebels. Through the arbitration of King LouisIX of France, an agreement was made between the two parties. This so-called Mise of Amiens was largely favourable to the royalist side, and laid the seeds for further conflict.|$|E

Ken Barrington's leg-spin was again widely used as he took 4/72, though the tailender Sargeant made 35 out of a stand of 41 for the seventh wicket and the Country XI made 190. Peter Parfitt opened the batting and made 41, adding 80 with the captain Mike Smith (81), who then added 61 with John Edrich (76) in a five wicket win.

Zander de Bruyn also made an unbeaten fifty to lift Worcestershire to 273 for 3. The Indian international Sourav Ganguly was the only Glamorga bowler to come <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> credit, as he got one wicket for 19 in his five overs. Worcestershire started creditably, snaring the wicket of Robert Croft in the second over, but Glamorgan sent out another pinch-hitter in Alex Wharf who made 38 before he was bowled bu David Leatherdale who took two for 35. However, Sourav Ganguly with 53, Michael Powell with 82, and David Hemp with an unbeaten 51 off 36 balls chased down the target. The Glamorgan batsman took a particular liking to England Test spinner Gareth Batty who finished wicketless for 69 runs.|$|E

500|$|Despite its {{derivative}} nature, Longacre's eagle {{has been}} widely admired. According to art historian Cornelius Vermeule in his book on U.S. coins, the flying eagle motif, when used in the 1830s, was [...] "the first numismatic bird that {{could be said to}} derive from nature rather than from colonial carving or heraldry". Vermeule described the Flying Eagle cent's replacement, the Indian Head cent, as [...] "far less attractive to the eye than the Peale-Gobrecht flying eagle and its variants". Sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, when commissioned in 1905 to provide new designs for American coinage, sought to return a flying eagle design to the cent, writing to President Theodore Roosevelt, [...] "I am using a flying eagle, a modification of the device which was used on the cent of 1857. I had not seen that coin for many years, and was so impressed by it that I thought if carried <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> modifications, nothing better could be done. It is by all odds the best design on any American coin." [...] Saint-Gaudens did return the flying eagle to American coinage, but his design was used for the reverse of the double eagle rather than the cent.|$|E
500|$|Maurice Richardson, of The Observer, {{considered}} the novel [...] "the usual sado-masochistic free-for-all, plus octopuses". The unnamed critic in The Manchester Guardian referred to Johnson's [...] "sex, snobbery and sadism" [...] complaint. They highlighted the [...] "sinister... cult of luxury {{for its own}} sake", with Bond's enjoyment of branded and bespoke products, but disagreed with part of Johnson's summary that the novel {{was a sign of}} moral decay; rather, [...] "we should be grateful to Mr. Fleming for providing a conveniently accessible safety-valve for the boiling sensibility of modern man." [...] This reviewer also conceded that while [...] "the casualties take place on a somewhat narrower front than usual, they are heavy". In April 1958, Fleming wrote to The Manchester Guardian in defence of his work, referring to both that paper's review of Dr. No and the article in The Twentieth Century. Fleming partly accepted the criticism concerning the exclusivity of Bond's objects, such as cigarettes and food, but defended it on the basis that [...] "I had to fit Bond <b>out</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> theatrical props". These included his cocktail, ("The Vesper") and Bond's diet. Fleming called these devices [...] "vulgar foibles" [...] which he was saddled with, although maybe, he suggested, [...] "Bond's luxury meals are simply saying 'no' to toad-in-the-hole and tele-bickies." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1971, a young gay Wiccan named Eddie Buczynski {{contacted}} Martello, {{and requested}} initiation. Due to Buczynski's inexperience in the religion, Martello turned him down, although developed {{a friendship with}} him. Martello introduced Buczynski both to other covens who might initiate him, and to Herman Slater, who would become his long-time partner. Slater was ill with various medical complications, and on one occasion was rehabilitating at the New York University Medical Center when Martello performed a healing ritual on him {{with the assistance of}} Buczynski. Martello would {{come to be known as}} a regular at The Warlock Shop, an occult store opened by Slater in New York. Through The WICA Newsletter, Martello had met Lady Gwen Thompson, the founder of the New England Covens of Traditionalist Witches (NECTW), and decided to introduce Buczynski to her, resulting in Buczynski's initiation into the tradition in Spring 1972. Martello and Thompson later fell <b>out,</b> <b>with</b> <b>some</b> unconfirmed accounts claiming that it was because he lent her money and she did not pay him back. In October 1972, Buczynski founded his own tradition of Wicca, termed Welsh Traditionalist Witchcraft, with Martello becoming an early initiate and taking on the name of [...] "Nemesis" [...] within that tradition. In turn, Martello welcomed Buczynski into his La Vecchia tradition, and initiated him through its three degree system.|$|E
