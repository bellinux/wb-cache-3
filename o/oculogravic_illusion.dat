40|$|Experimental {{subjects}} wore goggles that restricted monocular {{vision to}} a luminous line fixed {{relative to the}} head, and they were exposed on one occasion to a straight-ahead acceleration of an aircraft and on another occasion to a tilting chair. The magnitude of change of direction of the resultant acceleration was the same on both occasions, but the perceived movement of the luminous line from the two stimuli was very different. In response to the aircraft stimulus, the <b>oculogravic</b> <b>illusion</b> was experienced and the luminous line was perceived as tilting relative to the subject, {{in response to the}} tilting chair stimulus, the line was perceived as remaining fixed relative to the subject. It was concluded that the <b>oculogravic</b> <b>illusion,</b> as experienced in the aircraft (and previously in centrifuges), is a true illusion and not merely a fact of physics...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} interindividual {{differences}} in {{the judgment of the}} visually perceived eye level (VPEL-upright position) and of the visually perceived apparent zenith (VPAZ-supine position) when the subject is subjected to low gravitational-inertial force (GIF), we independently altered GIF in two different populations: control subjects and spatial experts. Subjects were instructed to set a luminous target to the eye level while they were in total darkness and motionless or undergoing low radial acceleration with respect to the threshold of the otolithic system (0. 015 - 1. 67 m/sec 2 for the VPEL and 0. 55 - 2. 19 m/sec 2 for the VPAZ, respectively). Results showed that (1) low GIFs, close to those met during daily life, induced an eye level lowering in the upright and supine positions for the control group, and (2) the spatial expertise modified the influence of low GIF. Whereas an <b>oculogravic</b> <b>illusion</b> was found for the control group, this phenomenon was absent (VPAZ) or weaker (VPEL) for the spatial experts. Thus, the relations that the subjects maintain with their spatial environment and the knowledge acquired through experience modify the processing of sensory information and the perceptive construction resulting from it. The interindividual differences in sensitivity to the <b>oculogravic</b> <b>illusion</b> are discussed in terms of sensory dominance and of a better efficiency {{in the use of the}} available sensory information...|$|E
40|$|Travelling {{on board}} of {{locomotion}} vehicles often induce sensorial stimulations which provoke perceptive illusions. These erroneous perceptions of body position were {{defined in the}} literature as spatial disorientation, which is principally considered as otolithic origin. In fact, during a forward sustained linear acceleration, the resultant of the imposed acceleration and gravity is no longer aligned with the gravitational vertical. As other physical accelerometer, the otolithic system cannot discriminate the acceleration of gravity from sustained inertial acceleration, and will perceive this resultant, defined as gravito-inertial acceleration (GiA), as the new vertical. Elevator and oculogravic illusions are listed among the most experienced behavioural effects. These illusions are defined as erroneous visual perception of object position in hypergravity environment. This thesis takes an interest in i) sensorial information cues involved in perceptive illusions in hypergravity, ii) interindividuals differences in the estimation of visual horizon, iii) the role of egocentric and exocentric references implicated in elevator and oculogravic illusions. Our results highlight: (1) the fundamental role of gravito inertial intensity in the visual horizon perception, (2) the coupled effect of body and visual egocentric perceptions in visual horizon estimation, (3) inter-individuals differences, due to the modulation of gravito-inertial intensity, explained by otolithic cues, (4) the contribution of somesthetic cues, in particular for <b>oculogravic</b> <b>illusion.</b> All of the studies referred in this thesis suggest a sensory approach in otolithic and somesthetic terms, {{as well as an}} individual approach for visual horizon perception...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{accurately}} localize an object, human observers must integrate multiple sensory cues {{related to the}} environment and/or to the body. Such multisensory integration must be repeated over time, so that spatial localization is constantly updated according to environmental changes. In the present experimental study, we examined the multisensory integration processes underlying spatial updating by investigating how gradual modifications of gravitoinertial cues (i. e., somatosensory and vestibular cues) and visual cues affect target localization skills. These were assessed by using a continuous pointing task toward a body-fixed visual target. The ``single'' rotation of the gravitoinertial vector (produced by off-axis centrifugation) resulted in downward pointing errors, which likely were related {{to a combination of}} <b>oculogravic</b> and somatogravic <b>illusions.</b> The ``single'' downward pitch rotation of the visual background produced an elevation of the arm relative to the visual target, suggesting that the rotation of the visual background caused an illusory target elevation (induced-motion phenomenon). Strikingly, the errors observed during the ``combined'' rotation of the visual background and of the gravitoinertial vector appeared as a linear combination of the errors independently observed during ``single'' rotations. In other words, the centrifugation effect on target localization was reduced by the visual background rotation. The observed linear combination indicates that the weights of visual and gravitoinertial cues were similar and remained constant throughout the stimulation...|$|R
40|$|Adaptation to the weightless {{state and}} readaptation after space {{flight to the}} 1 -G {{environment}} on the ground are accompanied by various transitory symptoms of vestibular instability, kinetosis, and illusory sensations. Aside from {{the problem of how}} to treat and if possible prevent such symptoms, they offer a clue to a better understanding of normal vestibular functions. Weightlessness is a powerful new "tool" of vestibular research. Graybiel reported as early as 1952 that human subjects observed the illusion that a real target and the visual afterimage seemed to raise in the visual field during centrifugation when the subjects were looking toward the axis of rotation (<b>oculogravic</b> <b>illusion).</b> In aircraft parabolic-flight weightlessness, human subjects observed that fixed real targets appeared to have moved downward while visual afterimages appeared to have moved upward (oculoagravic illusion). It can be shown by electronystagmography as well as by a method employing double afterimages that part of this illusion is caused by eye movements that are triggered by the changing input from the otolith system. Another part of the illusion is based on a change of the subjective horizontal and must be caused by convergence of vestibular and visual impulses "behind" the eyes. This part was measured independently of the first one by using a new method. Eye movements could be prevented during these experiments by optical fixation with the right eye on a target at the end of a 24 -in. long tube which was rigidly attached parallel to the longitudinal axis of an aircraft. At the same time the subject tried to line up a shorter tube, which was pivoting around his left eye, with the subjective horizon...|$|E
