5|$|Astrology saw {{a popular}} revival {{starting}} in the 19th century, {{as part of a}} general revival of spiritualism and—later, New Age philosophy, and through the influence of mass media such as newspaper horoscopes.

5|$|Following in {{the path}} paved by {{linguist}} Noam Chomsky, Fodor developed {{a strong commitment to}} the idea <b>of</b> <b>psychological</b> nativism. Nativism postulates the innateness of many cognitive functions and concepts. For Fodor, this position emerges naturally out of his criticism of behaviourism and associationism. These criticisms also led him to the formulation of his hypothesis of the modularity of the mind.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{importance}} of The Slave Community was recognized by scholars of American slavery, Blassingame's conclusions, methodology, and sources were heavily criticized. Historians criticized the use of slave narratives that were seen as unreliable and biased. They questioned Blassingame's decision to exclude the more than 2,000 interviews with former slaves conducted by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in the 1930s. Historians argued that Blassingame's use <b>of</b> <b>psychological</b> theory proved unhelpful in his interpretation. Blassingame defended his conclusions at a 1976 meeting of the Association for the Study of Afro-American Life and History and in 1979 published a revised and enlarged edition of The Slave Community. Despite criticisms, The Slave Community is a foundational text {{in the study of}} the life and culture of slaves in the antebellum South.|$|E

5|$|Cancer {{changes over}} time, and pain {{management}} needs to reflect this. Several {{different types of}} treatment may be required as the disease progresses.

The relief <b>of</b> <b>psychological,</b> social and spiritual distress is a key element in effective pain management.|$|E
5|$|Castillo Armas' army of 480 men was {{not large}} enough to defeat the Guatemalan military, even with U.S.-supplied aircraft. Therefore, the plans for Operation PBSUCCESS called for a {{campaign}} <b>of</b> <b>psychological</b> warfare, which would present Castillo Armas' victory as a fait accompli to the Guatemalan people, and would force Árbenz to resign. The propaganda campaign had begun well before the invasion, with the U.S. Information Agency (USIA) writing hundreds of articles on Guatemala based on CIA reports, and distributing {{tens of thousands of}} leaflets throughout Latin America. The CIA persuaded friendly governments to screen video footage of Guatemala that supported the U.S. version of events.|$|E

5|$|Despite its title, {{the novel}} does {{not so much}} deal with the crime and its formal punishment, as with Raskolnikov's {{internal}} struggle (the book shows that his punishment results more from his conscience than from the law). Believing society {{would be better for}} it, Raskolnikov commits murder with the idea that he possessed enough intellectual and emotional fortitude to deal with the ramifications, , but his sense of guilt soon overwhelms him to the point <b>of</b> <b>psychological</b> and somatic illness. It is only in the epilogue that he realizes his formal punishment, having decided to confess and end his alienation from society.|$|E
5|$|During the Ottoman rule of Greece, impalement {{became an}} {{important}} tool <b>of</b> <b>psychological</b> warfare, intended to put terror into the peasant population. By the 18th century, Greek bandits turned guerrilla insurgents (known as klephts) became an increasing annoyance to the Ottoman government. Captured klephts were often impaled, as were peasants that harbored or aided them. Victims were publicly impaled and placed at highly visible points, and had the intended effect on many villages who not only refused to help the klephts, but would even turn them in to the authorities. The Ottomans engaged in active campaigns to capture these insurgents in 1805 and 1806, {{and were able to}} enlist Greek villagers, eager to avoid the stake, in the hunt for their outlaw countrymen.|$|E

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} refers to {{issues at the}} theoretical foundations of modern psychology. Some of these issues are epistemological concerns about the methodology <b>of</b> <b>psychological</b> investigation. For example, is the best method for studying psychology to focus only on the response of behavior to external stimuli or should psychologists focus on mental perception and thought processes? If the latter, an important question is how the internal experiences of others can be measured. Self-reports of feelings and beliefs may not be reliable because, even in cases {{in which there is}} no apparent incentive for subjects to intentionally deceive in their answers, self-deception or selective memory may affect their responses. Then even in the case of accurate self-reports, how can responses be compared across individuals? Even if two individuals respond with the same answer on a Likert scale, they may be experiencing very different things.|$|E
5|$|Reactive {{attachment}} disorder {{first made}} its appearance in standard nosologies <b>of</b> <b>psychological</b> disorders in DSM-III, 1980, following {{an accumulation of}} evidence on institutionalized children. The criteria included a requirement of onset {{before the age of}} 8 months and was equated with failure to thrive. Both these features were dropped in DSM-III-R, 1987. Instead, onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories, inhibited and disinhibited. These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version, DSM-IV, 1994, and its 2000 text revision, DSM-IV-TR, as well as in ICD-10, 1992. Both nosologies focus on young children who are not merely at increased risk for subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance.|$|E
5|$|Rolling Thunder {{had begun}} as a {{campaign}} <b>of</b> <b>psychological</b> and strategic persuasion, but it changed very quickly to interdiction, a tactical mission.

The civilians, moreover, did not understand air power {{well enough to know}} that their policies might be crippling it; second, the American military leadership failed to initially propose and develop, or later to adapt, an appropriate strategy for the war.|$|E

5|$|The benzodiazepines {{diazepam}} (Valium) and oxazepam (Serepax) {{have been}} found to produce fewer withdrawal reactions than alprazolam (Xanax), temazepam (Restoril/Normison), or lorazepam (Temesta/Ativan). Factors that determine the risk <b>of</b> <b>psychological</b> dependence or physical dependence and the severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms during dose reduction of alprazolam include: dosage used, length of use, frequency of dosing, personality characteristics of the individual, previous use of cross-dependent/cross-tolerant drugs (alcohol or other sedative-hypnotic drugs), current use of cross-dependent/-tolerant drugs, use of other short-acting, high-potency benzodiazepines, and method of discontinuation.|$|E
5|$|In November 1952, Dwight Eisenhower {{was elected}} {{president}} of the US. Eisenhower's campaign had promised a more hawkish stance against communism. Many senior figures in his cabinet, including John Foster Dulles and his brother Allen, had close connections to the United Fruit Company, which made Eisenhower more strongly predisposed than Truman to support Árbenz's overthrow. In June 1954, the US trained and funded an invasion force led by Castillo Armas, backed by an intense campaign <b>of</b> <b>psychological</b> warfare by the CIA. Árbenz resigned on 27 June 1954, ending the Guatemalan Revolution. From 1954 onwards Guatemala was ruled by a series of US-backed military dictators, leading to the Guatemalan Civil War. 200,000 civilians were killed in the war, and numerous human rights violations committed, including massacres of civilian populations, rape, aerial bombardment, and forced disappearances. 93% of these violations were committed by the United States-backed military, which included a genocidal scorched-earth campaign against the indigenous Maya population in the 1980s.|$|E
