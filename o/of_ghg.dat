5|$|Croatian air {{pollution}} levels reflect {{the drop in}} industrial production recorded in 1991 {{at the onset of}} the Croatian War of Independence—pre-war emission levels were only reached in 1997. The use of desulfurized fuels has led to a 25% reduction of sulphur dioxide emissions between 1997 and 2004, and a further 7.2% drop by 2007. The rise in NOx emissions halted in 2007 and reversed in 2008. The use of unleaded petrol reduced emissions of lead into the atmosphere by 91.5% between 1997 and 2004. Air quality measurements indicate that the air in rural areas is essentially clean, and in urban centres it generally complies with legal requirements. The most significant sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Croatia are energy production (72%), industry (13%) and agriculture (11%). The average annual increase <b>of</b> <b>GHG</b> emissions is 3%, remaining within the Kyoto Protocol limits. Between 1990 and 2007, the use of ozone depleting substances was reduced by 92%; their use is expected to be abolished by 2015.|$|E
25|$|The GHG footprint, or {{greenhouse}} gas footprint, {{refers to the}} amount <b>of</b> <b>GHG</b> that are emitted during the creation of products or services.

25|$|Mitigation {{of climate}} change {{involves}} actions {{that are designed to}} limit the amount of long-term climate change (Fisher et al., 2007:225). Mitigation may be achieved through the reduction <b>of</b> <b>GHG</b> emissions or through the enhancement of sinks that absorb GHGs, e.g., forests.|$|E

30|$|In general, {{emissions}} <b>of</b> <b>GHGs</b> {{are directly}} related to the energy consumption. If only emissions <b>of</b> <b>GHGs</b> by operations are considered, regarding the above-mentioned primary energy source, the HS system will not make any of them. However, the indirect emissions from building the infrastructure (lines and stations/terminals), rolling stock (capsules), and other equipment should be taken into account in cases of dealing with the system’s life-cycle emissions <b>of</b> <b>GHGs.</b>|$|R

25|$|An {{additional}} complication is that production requires tilling new soil {{which produces}} a one-off release <b>of</b> <b>GHG</b> {{that it can}} take decades or centuries of production reductions in GHG emissions to equalize.

The OECD study found that trade restrictions, mainly through import tariffs, protect the domestic industry from foreign competitors but impose a cost burden on domestic biofuel users and limits alternative suppliers. The report is also critical of limited reduction <b>of</b> <b>GHG</b> emissions achieved from biofuels based on feedstocks used in Europe and North America, finding that the current biofuel support policies would reduce greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuel by no more than 0.8% by 2015, while Brazilian ethanol from sugar cane reduces greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% compared to fossil fuels.

2500|$|Quantitative {{values of}} {{greenhouse}} gas emissions calculated with the WTW or with the LCA method can differ, since the LCA is considering more emission sources. In example, while assessing the GHG emissions of a Battery Electric Vehicle in comparison with a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle, the WTW (accounting only the GHG for manufacturing the fuels) finds out that an electric vehicle can save the 50-60% <b>of</b> <b>GHG</b> , while an hybrid LCA-WTW method, considering also the GHG due to the manufacturing {{and the end of}} life of the battery gives GHG emission savings 10-13% lower, compared to the WTW.|$|E
2500|$|Some sources {{disagree}} {{with some of}} the figures used in arriving at the FAO estimate of 18 percent. For example, the FAO report estimates that 37 percent of global anthropogenic methane emissions are attributable to the livestock sector, and a NASA summary indicates about 30 percent. Because of the GWP multiplier used, such a difference between estimates will have a large effect on an estimate <b>of</b> <b>GHG</b> CO2 equivalents contributed by the livestock sector. Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as CO2 equivalents. This estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.|$|E

40|$|How can the {{informed}} citizen know if {{the government}} is implementing a good-enough climate change policy? Most developed democracies have their own set of indicators for sustainable development, including indicators for climate change. These include yearly national emissions <b>of</b> greenhouse gasses (<b>GHGs),</b> global concentration <b>of</b> <b>GHGs</b> in the atmosphere and time series for global temperatures. However, without some kind of benchmark neither national emissions <b>of</b> <b>GHGs</b> nor global concentration <b>of</b> <b>GHGs</b> or temperatures, make it possible for the general public to evaluate the current climate policy of a nation state. In this paper we propose a benchmark for national climate policy based on a remaining CO 2 budget allocated by egalitarian principles. Moreover, based on Kantian ethics we argue that this benchmark should be used as a sustainable development indicator for climate change. One way of interpreting Kantian ethics is to demand that each nation state should act as if a just global treaty on climate change were in place. We discuss possible important elements in a global treaty, and show how the different elements can be integrated in a forward-looking indicator of national climate policy...|$|R
2500|$|Biochar is a {{charcoal}} {{that is used}} for agricultural purposes which also aids in carbon sequestration, the capture or hold of carbon. [...] It is created using a process called pyrolysis, which is basically the act of high temperature heating biomass in an environment with low oxygen levels. [...] What remains is a material known as char, similar to charcoal but is made through a sustainable process, thus the use of biomass. [...] Biomass is organic matter produced by living organisms or recently living organisms, most commonly plants or plant based material. The offset <b>of</b> <b>GHG</b> emission, if biochar were to be implemented, would be a maximum of 12%. [...] This equates to about 106 metric tons of CO2 equivalents. [...] On a medium conservative level, it would be 23% less than that, at [...] 82 metric tons. A study done by the UK Biochar Research Center has stated that, on a conservative level, biochar can store 1 gigaton of carbon per year. [...] With greater effort in marketing and acceptance of biochar, the benefit could be the storage of 5–9 gigatons per year of carbon in biochar soils.|$|E

40|$|The {{global climate}} is {{changing}} {{and much of}} this is attributed to the greenhouse effect, which has been exacerbated by increased anthropogenic releases <b>of</b> greenhouse gases (<b>GHGs).</b> However, important GHGs, carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and methane (CH 4), are produced naturally in the soil during the metabolism of many soil microbial and plant communities. The generation rate <b>of</b> <b>GHGs</b> depends on many factors, including soil community composition, nutrient availability, temperature, and soil moisture. Predicted climate variability is expected to alter temperature and rainfall patterns, which can impact the factors regulating natural generation <b>of</b> <b>GHGs.</b> With changing fluxes <b>of</b> <b>GHGs,</b> the natural feedback loops between GHG generation and climate may change. Increased emissions from natural sources would exacerbate climate change, whereas decreased emissions may mitigate its impacts. Floodplains may be particularly susceptible to climate change, as their biogeochemical processing is driven by hydrology. For this study, ten mesocosms were installed on the floodplain of Stroubles Creek in southwest Virginia.
