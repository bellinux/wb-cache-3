5|$|In 2008, {{one hundred}} million NOK were given {{from the state}} budget of Norway to make {{improvements}} to the Oslo Tunnel following a cable fire at Skøyen Station. The replacement of the <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> would be started close to Elisenberg Station.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, the Oslo Metro opened as {{an upgrade}} of two {{existing}} suburban tramways, the Østensjø- and Lambertseter Lines. By 1970, {{the system was}} supplemented by the Grorud- and Furuset Lines. They only operated to the eastern suburbs. In 1987, the system was expanded to connect to the western network, that remained a suburban tramway with <b>overhead</b> <b>wires,</b> two-car platforms and an inferior signaling system. In 1993, the Sognsvann Line was converted to metro standard, with the Røa Line following two years later. When the order for the MX3000 trains was placed, the Kolsås- and Holmenkoll Lines still used <b>overhead</b> <b>wires,</b> {{and would not be}} able to use the new stock. Both systems were at the time being considered for conversion to light rail systems, that would connect to the Lilleaker- and Ullevål Hageby Line, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Pevsner City Guide to Manchester {{described}} the cenotaph {{as one of}} the few impressive war memorials in Manchester but lamented its original cluttered setting and its proximity to <b>overhead</b> <b>wires.</b> The cenotaph, obelisks, and stone are features typical of Lutyens' war memorial work, although Manchester's is one of only two with flanking obelisks—Northampton's has a similar pair of obelisks flanking a Stone of Remembrance.|$|E
50|$|Until May 1911, part of {{the system}} was {{equipped}} with conduit supply to avoid unsightly <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> on the central section of the tramway. From May 1911, <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> was introduced.|$|R
2500|$|Since {{electrification}} generally predated double-stacking, the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> was too low {{to accommodate}} it. However, India is building some freight-only corridors with the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> at [...] above rail, which is high enough.|$|R
50|$|Shenyang Modern Tram is {{the first}} partly battery powered tram both in China and Asia. This tram system mostly uses {{traditional}} <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> system, but partly uses charged battery system, without <b>overhead</b> <b>wire.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} buses ran on diesel fuel, but {{the system}} allows for buses that run on alternative energy sources. Biodiesel fuel and natural gas have been trialled, and 20% of the Adelaide bus fleet uses compressed natural gas, 48% B20 and 32% B5 biodiesel blends. The design of the O-Bahn allows for the installation of <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> for trolleybuses.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} Causeway {{had carried}} electric trams, {{and it was}} expected that the new Causeway would also carry trams, or perhaps trolleybuses instead. However, the proposed <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> were deemed too ugly for the new bridge, and between £30,000 and £40,000 could be saved by using buses instead. The routes using the Causeway were replaced with bus services, but the bridges as constructed were nonetheless designed to be able to carry trams.|$|E
5|$|The {{vehicles}} {{have three}} braking systems: a primary regenerative dynamic brake, a secondary disc brake and an emergency rail brake. When braking with the regenerative brake, the energy can be fed {{back to the}} <b>overhead</b> <b>wires.</b> The trams are dimensioned to operate an entire day with the dynamic brakes disconnected from one bogie, and for one hour if disconnected from two bogies, in which case only disc brakes will be used.|$|E
50|$|Since {{electrification}} generally predated double-stacking, the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> was too low {{to accommodate}} it. However, India is building some freight-only corridors with the <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> at 7.45 m above rail, which is high enough.|$|R
50|$|For the {{purposes}} of inspection of <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring,</b> carriage 3CM was constructed to a modified design with an overhead compartment for inspectors to watch {{the way that the}} <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> reacted to contact with pantographs.|$|R
50|$|The Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn has {{two lines}} with {{different}} electrification. To {{be able to}} use different electric systems on shared tracks, the Sihltal line has its <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> right above the train, whilst the Uetliberg line has its <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> off to one side.|$|R
5|$|The Østensjø Line {{would be}} {{converted}} to metro standard, and three new lines would be built. The Lambertseter Line opened as a light rail line from Brynseng station, where it connected to the Vålerenga Line, to Bergkrystallen station on 28 April 1957. Originally it had <b>overhead</b> <b>wires,</b> low platforms and was served using trams. The Ekeberg Line would remain a tramway. The Lambertseter Line served the area located between the Ekeberg and Østensjø Lines. The Østensjø Line was extended to Bøler station in 1958.|$|E
5|$|After the {{municipal}} merger between Oslo and Aker in 1948, Akersbanerne was merged into Oslo Sporveier, although Holmenkolbanen remained a partially owned subsidiary. In 1973, Oslo Sporveier bought the remaining shares, {{and two years}} later the operations were transferred to Oslo Sporveier, with Holmenkolbanen remaining a pure real estate company. The municipal take-over resulted in an upgrade to both the track and the rolling stock. New <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> and new and heavier track were laid. From 1978, the T1300 trains were taken into use. With the take-over, the lines were numbered, and the Sognsvann Line designated 81, although this was quickly changed to 13.|$|E
5|$|In April 1999, NSB {{launched}} a new branding scheme for their trains. In addition to Puls for local trains and Agenda for regional trains, the Signatur ("Signature") concept was introduced for intercity trains. Signatur would only be used on the Class 73 services, and consist of two classes, Comfort and Comfort Plus. NSB abolished its branding of only having red trains, and introduced a blue and silver livery on the Class 73 trains. The new service had fewer stops and faster travel times. To {{take advantage of the}} faster speeds, the Norwegian National Rail Administration needed to do upgrades to the track, <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> and signaling for NOK1.2 billion.|$|E
50|$|The rail {{was removed}} in 2003-2004, {{and ended up}} at the Yarra Valley Tourist Railway, with all <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> on the siding gone by this time. A dwarf signal and <b>overhead</b> <b>wiring</b> {{stanchions}} remain in the paper mill grounds themselves. The paper mill was closed in 2012.|$|R

5|$|Oslo Sporveier {{opted for}} the all-new MX3000 from Siemens as a {{replacement}} for the T1000 stock instead of the T2000. Although its design was found to be unsuitable, the T2000 was initially not planned to be replaced by the MX3000, as the line was to remain with <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> and none of the new MX3000 trains are equipped with pantographs. However, following Oslo's decision to host the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011, it was decided to upgrade the Holmenkollen Line to full metro standard, allowing longer than two-car trains. A proposal to downgrade the line to light rail standard and make it part of the Oslo Tramway was rejected.|$|E
5|$|The {{light rail}} model {{would have used}} the same {{approach}} as the tram in Ørestad, but would instead have run through a tunnel in the city centre. The tunnel sections would be shorter, but the diameter larger {{because it would have}} to accommodate <b>overhead</b> <b>wires.</b> The system would have the same frequency as the tram, but use double trams and would therefore require larger stations. The metro solution was chosen because it combined the highest average speeds, the highest passenger capacity, the lowest visual and noise impact, and the lowest number of accidents. Despite requiring the highest investment, it had the highest net present value.|$|E
5|$|Tunnel {{construction}} {{was completed in}} early June 1990, {{a few weeks before}} the June 23 completion of the Waterfront Streetcar extension serving the future station. International District station was dedicated at a public open house during the annual Seafair on July 15, 1990. Bus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel began on September 15, 1990, with several Metro bus routes moved into the tunnel from surface streets. The tunnel was served by dual-mode buses that would switch from diesel power to electric trolleybus (supplied by <b>overhead</b> <b>wires)</b> at International District station and Convention Place station, the tunnel's respective termini.|$|E

5|$|One {{young man}} kicked and smashed {{the window of}} a police car, lit a pack of matches, and set the {{upholstery}} on fire. After burning for a short time, the fuel tank exploded; a dozen more police cars and eight other automobiles would be destroyed in a similar fashion. The photo on the front cover of the Dead Kennedys 1980 album Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables, which shows several police cars on fire, was taken that night. Several crowd members threw tear gas, which they had stolen from police vehicles. Riots began to break out, with one mob disrupting traffic. Electric trollies were disabled when their <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> were pulled down, and violence broke out against the police officers, who were outnumbered. Police Chief Charles Gain, standing inside City Hall, ordered officers not to attack and to simply stand their ground.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} {{initially}} operated by steam locomotives, however {{the cost of}} steam power was large; and on 7 June 1910 a contract with Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (today AEG) of Berlin was signed to provide <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> and five electric locomotives. The Rjukan Line became the second electrified railway in Norway, after the Thamshavn Line, and the first that would {{be connected to the}} main railway network. The first electric locomotive was taken into operation on 30 November 1911. Because only some of the locomotives were delivered, steam locomotive had to help with the service. Because of insufficient safety routines there were several fatalities among employees, and not until 1922 was sufficient policy initiated.|$|E
5|$|To {{make the}} tunnel water and frost tight, {{the walls were}} covered with {{polyethylene}} mats. Because they are highly flammable, they were then covered in a layer of gunite. Also installed were fire water pipes and ventilation systems to remove smoke. To sound-insulate the tunnel and avoid vibrations spreading to nearby housing, the entire tunnel was covered in a layer of rock wool. By December 2010, the ballast had been laid, and in January 2011 laying of the tracks and ties started. The work to build the tracks and <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> has been contracted to Baneservice. The contract for the electro-technical installations was awarded to YIT Building Systems for NOK120 million. As of 2006, the whole section from Lysaker to Sandvika was estimated to cost NOK2.7 billion.|$|E
2500|$|The grooved {{trolley wheel}} was used on many large city systems through the 1940s and 1950s; it was {{generally}} used on systems with [...] "old" [...] style round cross sectional <b>overhead</b> <b>wire.</b> The trolley wheel was problematic at best; the circumferential contact of the grooved wheel bearing {{on the underside of}} the <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> provided minimal electrical contact and tended to arc excessively, increasing <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> wear [...] The newer sliding carbon trolley shoe was generally used with a newer grooved <b>overhead</b> trolley <b>wire</b> of a roughly [...] "figure 8" [...] cross section. The sliding trolley shoe provided better electrical contact (with a reduction in arcing), and it dramatically reduced <b>overhead</b> <b>wire</b> wear. Many systems began converting to the sliding trolley shoe in the 1920s; Milwaukee, Wisconsin converted its large system in the late 1920s. Curiously, Philadelphia did not convert its trolley wheels on its remaining streetcars until 1978. Although a streetcar with a trolley wheel may evoke an antique look, the trolley shoe is modern and more practical as well as economical.|$|R

5|$|The first Norwegian-built tram was {{delivered}} on 16 February 1983 {{and put into}} service on 9 March. The last unit was put into service on 10 January 1984. The Strømmen trams were numbered 111 through 125. There were few problems in the start, although the pantographs had technical problems and there were occasional power failures in the <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> due to out-of-date rectifiers {{not being able to}} handle the increase power usage. Trams no. 101 through 113 were put into service on Line 9 on the Lilleaker Line and the Ekeberg Line, replacing the Class E. The remaining trams of the first series were put into service on Line 1, on the Sinsen Line and the Briskeby Line, as well as Line 7, on the Ullevål Hageby Line and the Sinsen Line. On Line 9, that included both the tramway's light rail sections, only SL79-trams were used, while lines 1 and 7 used a mix of SL79 and SM53-trams.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century the District and Metropolitan {{railways}} faced increased competition in central London from new, electric, deep-level tube lines. The City & South London Railway had been a great success when it opened in 1890. After the opening of the Central London Railway in 1900 from Shepherd's Bush to the City with a flat rate fare of 2d, the District and Metropolitan together lost four million passengers between the second half of 1899 and the second half of 1900. The use of steam propulsion led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the way forward. However, electric traction was still in its infancy and agreement would be needed with the Metropolitan because of the shared ownership of the inner circle. A jointly owned train of six coaches successfully ran an experimental passenger service on the Earl's Court to High Street Kensington section for six months in 1900. Tenders were then requested and in 1901 a Metropolitan and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with <b>overhead</b> <b>wires.</b> Initially this was accepted by both parties.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{section of}} the metro was the Holmenkollen Line, which opened as a suburban tramway in 1898. The Røa Line was the next to open as a branch, in 1912. The system became the first Nordic underground railway in 1928, when the underground line to Nationaltheatret was opened. The Østensjø Line opened in 1923, the Sognsvann Line in 1934, and the Kolsås Line in 1942. The opening of the upgraded metro system in the eastern boroughs occurred in 1966, after {{the conversion of the}} 1957 Lambertseter Line to metro standard. This involved the implementation of automatic train protection, longer platforms, replacement of the <b>overhead</b> <b>wires</b> with third rail and removal of level crossings. This was followed by the conversion of the Østensjø Line to metro standard, as well as the new Grorud Line and the Furuset Line. From 1987 to 1993, trains terminated at Stortinget, which has since then been the basis for the kilometer markers. In 1993, for the first time, trains ran through the city between the two networks in the Common Tunnel. The latest extension is the 2006 opening of the Ring Line, which connects the eastern and western network north of the city center. Between 2006 and 2010, the older T1000 stock was replaced with MX3000 trains.|$|E
