5|$|Aronofsky's sixth film, the biblically {{inspired}} epic Noah, {{was released}} in theaters on March 28, 2014. Noah grossed over $43.7 million during its opening box office weekend, becoming Aronofsky's highest opening weekend and his first film to open at No.1. The film was an international hit, eventually grossing over $362 million worldwide. His seventh film, the psychological horror Mother!, was released to theaters on September 15, 2017, by Paramount Pictures; the film sparked controversy upon release due to its biblical allegories and depiction <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> <b>and</b> polarized audiences.|$|E
40|$|This paper argues that, however useful {{the results}} of such {{interventions}} might be, the chosen measures <b>of</b> crime <b>and</b> <b>violence</b> underestimate certain types <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> particularly non-economic <b>violence,</b> <b>and</b> key dimensions <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> particularly gender <b>and</b> age. Complementary methodologies are therefore necessary for a more holistic understanding of the complexities <b>of</b> urban <b>violence.</b> The following section presents two conceptual tools for understanding <b>violence</b> manifestations <b>and</b> causality which provide a structure to the discussion <b>of</b> crime <b>and</b> <b>violence</b> measurement issues. Section III will provide a critical examination <b>of</b> crime <b>and</b> <b>violence</b> indicators, focusing on the ways that underreporting and misclassification contribute to a skewed picture <b>of</b> <b>violence.</b> Sections IV <b>and</b> V review quantitative and qualitative methodologies used in violence research, with lessons learned from research experiences in the Americas.

5|$|Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1833 {{and now in}} Tate Britain. Intended to illustrate the virtues of honour and chastity, it depicts a scene from Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene in which the female warrior Britomart slays the evil magician Busirane and frees his captive, the beautiful Amoret. In Spenser's original poem Amoret has been tortured and mutilated {{by the time of}} her rescue, but Etty disliked the depiction <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> portrayed her as unharmed.|$|E

The film explores several themes, including the consequence <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> father-son relationships.|$|E

The Mafia bosses Vito Cascioferro and Nunzio Giaimo led the Fasci in Bisacquino in alliance with Verro.

5|$|The late Republic saw an {{increase}} in the centralisation of power into the hands of provincial governors, the use of military power to enforce political changes (e.g. the Sullan dictatorship), and the use of violence, combined with exploitation of the suitably bribed or intimidated 'sovereign' assemblies, to grant supreme authority to victorious commanders. The increasing legitimisation <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> centralisation of authority into fewer and fewer men would, with the collapse of trust in the Republic's institutions, put it on a path to civil war and its transformation into the autocratic Roman Empire.|$|E

5|$|After the {{establishment}} of Hohenstaufen authority Latin- and Greek-speaking Christians maintained their privileges, but the Muslim population was increasingly oppressed. The settlements of Italians brought from northern Italy (who wanted Muslim property for their own) led many Muslim communities to revolt or resettle in mountainous areas of Sicily. These revolts resulted in some acts <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> <b>and</b> the eventual deportation of Muslims, which began under Frederick II. Eventually, the government removed the entire Muslim population to Lucera in Apulia and Girifalco in Calabria, where they paid taxes and served as agricultural laborers, craftsmen, and crossbowmen {{for the benefit of}} the king. The colony at Lucera was finally disbanded in 1300 under Charles II of Naples, and many of its inhabitants sold into slavery. The Jewish community was expelled after {{the establishment}} of the Spanish Inquisition from 1493 to 1513 in Sicily. The remaining Jews were gradually assimilated, and most of them converted to Roman Catholicism.|$|E
5|$|Although he briefly {{supported}} {{the idea of}} reconciliation between Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, Lenin's advocacy <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> robbery was condemned by the Mensheviks at the Fourth Party Congress, held in Stockholm in April 1906.

As the Tsarist government cracked down on opposition – both by disbanding Russia's legislative assembly, the Second Duma, and by ordering its secret police, the Okhrana, to arrest revolutionaries – Lenin fled Finland for Switzerland.

5|$|Following its {{announcement}} in May 2006, Grand Theft Auto IV was widely anticipated. Upon release, the game received universal critical acclaim, with praise particularly {{directed at the}} game's narrative and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at the game's depiction <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> players' ability to drive {{under the influence of}} alcohol. Grand Theft Auto IV broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history at the time, earning US $310 million in its first day and US $500 million in its first week. Considered {{one of the most significant}} titles of the seventh generation of video games, and by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time, it won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. A sequel, Grand Theft Auto V, was released in September 2013.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's assassin Godse made {{no attempt}} to escape and was seized by the witnesses. He was arrested. In the weeks that followed, his {{collaborators}} were arrested as well. Godse was a Hindu nationalist with links to the extremist Hindu Mahasabha. They were tried in court at Delhi's Red Fort. At his trial, Godse did not deny the charges nor express any remorse. According to Claude Markovits, a French historian noted for his studies of colonial India, Godse stated that he killed Gandhi because of his complacence towards Muslims, holding Gandhi responsible for the frenzy <b>of</b> <b>violence</b> <b>and</b> sufferings during the subcontinent's partition into Pakistan and India. Godse accused Gandhi of subjectivism and of acting as if only he had a monopoly of the truth. Godse was found guilty and executed in 1949.|$|E
5|$|IGN's Chloi Rad commended the game's {{blend of}} drama and action, {{as well as}} the {{realistic}} depiction <b>of</b> <b>violence,</b> <b>and</b> felt that the game's setting and period helped demonstrate the spirit of the revolution. Andrew Todd of Gameplanet praised the game's manner of dealing with issues like inequality, theocracy, and causes of anti-Americanism, and noted that they help create the atmosphere of the story and setting. Eurogamer's Jeffrey Matulef found the narrative's moral ambiguity refreshing, particularly the depiction of corrupting good people. He felt that the development team being primarily Iranian added to the game's authenticity. Kotakus Evan Narcisse similarly appreciated the ambiguity, noting its close imitation to the era. The choices presented in the game split reviewers; some found them important and scary, while others found them ultimately inconsequential.|$|E
