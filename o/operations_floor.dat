50|$|The BCD Operations Section {{operates}} {{within the}} AOC Combat Operations Division (COD) on the <b>operations</b> <b>floor</b> {{to monitor the}} execution of US Army Air Support in the ATO. The Operations Section provides ground situation updates to the Combined/Joint Force Air Component Commander (C/JFACC) and Chief of AOC Combat Operations to allow expeditious decision making pertaining to Air Force support to the US Army. The Operations Section also coordinates US Army Fire Support to the Air Force, personnel recovery, dynamic targeting. The Operations Section also coordinates with the Navy, Marine, and Special Force Liaisons to the AOC to provide additional means of joint coordination. The BCD Operations Section placement in the AOC and integration into ARFOR planning/execution cycles as well as ABCS systems, allows it to have maximum situational awareness in the joint fight and provide very significant (albeit unseen) contributions to the ARFOR effort.|$|E

The South Stand consists of the Club Level which houses a restaurant space, lounge area and 3 conference rooms; and the Suite Level, with 18 individual suites which are to be furnished by the end users.|$|R
50|$|There are 19 {{separate}} {{floor levels}} in the tower, including the operations area {{at the base of}} the tower and a total of 1230 m2 of floor space. Six of the 19 floors are considered main floors. These include the operational level {{at the base of the}} tower, two equipment floors, an observation floor, a service floor and the cab floor at the top of the tower from which the air traffic controllers overlook the entire airport. The <b>operations</b> <b>floor</b> houses the radar control center for the airport as well as conference rooms, offices and a training area. The two equipment level contain mechanical and electrical equipment and cables, and the service floor contains a kitchen, lounge and lavatories for personnel on duty in the cab. The cab itself contains controller operating positions and electronic and communications equipment. The tower is supplied with two sources of standby power should the regular source of power be interrupted. Once source is the standby power supply at the central power plant - three diesel engine generators. In addition, a 300 kilowatt diesel engine located in the tower itself can provide a secondary source of emergency power. The tower is outfitted with the most advanced electronic radar systems and data processing equipment available.|$|E
5000|$|Alex's past love interest. Though {{they had}} a very rough start from the {{beginning}} they eventually started to soften towards each other. Sean has a hard time getting Alex to bring down her walls. Alex herself tries not to get emotional and Sean sometimes gets Alex to recognize that he likes her. Despite Sean giving many signs of attraction to Alex, she either ignored them or she was oblivious to them since she was emotionally not ready to commit to a relationship with all the things happening in her life. He and Alex share a first kiss in a car with Birkoff driving and Ryan in the passenger seat. In the second-season finale, he tries to ask her out on a date four times, but Alex never lets him finish due to being in action, criticizing that he said that she was a goal, Alex passing out due to a broken arm and being electrocuted, and Nikita interrupting Sean right before he was going to ask Alex while she was in a Division medical facility. At the start of season 3, it appears Alex and Sean are in a relationship. However, by episode 3 it is revealed that Sean is only atDivision for Alex, because he loved her. But Alex is at Division because it is the only place she knows as home, where she can be herself, and where her [...] "family" [...] (Nikita) is. After a toxin is released in the lab, Sean returns to ask Alex why she's not returning his calls, and asks her again why she's still there. [...] "I can't tell you what to do, Alex, but I'm not going to stand by and watch this place destroy another person that I love," [...] he says before he kisses her. [...] "I love you, but if that's not enough of a reason for you to leave, I've got no reason to stay." [...] After he leaves, she pops a pill and heads for the <b>operations</b> <b>floor,</b> insisting that she ought {{to be included in the}} hunt for Amanda. They eventually make up after an emotional scene in a medical room, they then entered a storage closet and make love, for the first time. In [...] "Black Badge", Amanda framed Sean for the death of the head of the CIA. As a result, they faked his death and Sean was officially welcomed into Division by Alex. Sean died in season 3 episode 18, as a result of a bullet nicking his artery. They shared their last moments together in where they met, operations. When Nikita enters OPS, she finds Birkoff near Sean and Alex gone. She presumably went to get revenge for the current events. Sean later died in Alex's arms towards the end of season 3.|$|E
30|$|In mine roadway support <b>operations,</b> <b>floor</b> bolting {{not only}} {{played a role}} in floor heave control, but also in {{reinforcing}} roof and its two sides. Correspondingly, bolting of roof and two sides also played a part in floor heave control. To quantify the effect of such bolting, based on roadway support in extremely weak rock, three physical models were produced and tested in laboratory. Through comparison of their displacements in three physical simulation experiments, the reinforcing effect of bolting in extremely weak rock roadways was quantified. Reinforcing coefficients was defined as displacement ratio between original support and new support regime. Results indicated that the reinforcing coefficients, for bolting of roof and its two sides, on floor, two sides, and roof reached 2.18, 3.56, and 1.81 respectively. The reinforcing coefficients for floor bolting on floor, two sides, and roof reached 3.06, 2.34, and 1.39 respectively. So in this extremely weak rock, the surrounding rock should be considered as an integral structure in any support operation: this allows for better local strength improvement, and provided future design guidance.|$|E

40|$|Purpose This paper aims {{to propose}} a model of {{production}} management that integrates knowledge management, as a third dimension, to the production and work dimensions and to identify factors that promote a favorable context for knowledge sharing and results achievement in the production <b>operations</b> shop <b>floor</b> environment. Design/methodology/approach The model proposed is built from opportunities identified in the literature review. Findings The factors in the model integrate its three main components: knowledge management, production organization and work organization, providing {{a representation of the}} dynamics of the workplace and shop floor environment. Practical implications The proposed model and its factors allow managers to better understand and to improve the organization activities, because it integrates knowledge management with the production organization and work organization components of traditional models. Originality/value Literature acknowledges the role of knowledge as competitive advantage, but it is still dealt in an implicit way within the traditional models of production management. This paper proposes a model and factors that provide a favorable context for tacit knowledge sharing and results achievement in the production <b>operations</b> shop <b>floor</b> environment.
