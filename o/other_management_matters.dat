40|$|Because of the {{systemic}} connections between soils {{and many other}} issues, the attention that is actually paid to soil issues is far greater than is immediately apparent. In many countries, scientists, public servants and politicians are debating sequestration of carbon in soils, deforestation and <b>other</b> land <b>management</b> <b>matters</b> which impact the soil, the atmosphere and the human interests bound up in these. This special edition arose from a workshop held in Iceland in 2012, supported by the Australian Research Council and hosted by the Icelandic Soils Service. It brought together researchers and practitioners with expertise and interest in the human dimensions of natural resource governance. An aim was to generate fresh perspectives on how to govern human behaviour, to improve the sustainability and fairness of our use of the land. The team included experts and practitioners in soil issues, community engagement, psychology, sociology, economics, law and other disciplines from many countries. The papers in this special edition reflect issues that have also been canvassed in other investigations. These papers provide some different perspectives as well as reinforcing some common themes...|$|R

40|$|Does public <b>management</b> <b>matter</b> for the {{performance}} of public programs? And if so, how? In what ways and via what routes does management shape what happens? Scholars of the subject are convinced of the importance of public management for performance. Considerable literature suggests myriad ways that the actions of managers seem to shape the outputs and outcomes of public policy. Still, for all the investment by researchers and practitioners in the assumption that <b>management</b> <b>matters</b> [...] and that, indeed, the requisites of good public management are reasonably well known, codifiable, and teachable [...] precious little careful analytical attention has been devoted to an explication of the basic questions. How might one test the crucial proposition that public <b>management</b> <b>matters?</b> Even more fundamentally, how ought one to model explicitly the impact of public management on governmenta...|$|R
40|$|Scholars {{of public}} {{management}} have consistently found that <b>management</b> <b>matters,</b> but {{little research has}} considered how much <b>management</b> <b>matters</b> or whether the link between management and performance may be contingent on various factors. This article further investigates the link between management and performance by examining the functional form of the relationship. Analyses using data from 1000 + public organizations point to some diminishing returns. Results suggest that networking with other organizations might not always result in gains for the organization. Findings also show how managerial quality and differences in organizational staff can affect this relationship...|$|R
40|$|While recent {{research}} has shown that <b>management</b> <b>matters,</b> we know very little about the role of national contexts in shaping management effects on performance. We address this issue by comparing the impact of management of similar organizations—schools—in very different national contexts, the unitary and corporatist Denmark and the fragmented, adversarial Texas. We hypothesize that external as well as internal <b>management</b> <b>matter</b> more in Texas than Denmark. This is because Texas principals can gain power by negotiating the adversarial system, while the corporatist influence of teachers reduces the decision authority of principals in Denmark through collective agreements and important shop stewards. Based on combinations of parallel surveys of school principals and archival data on student performance, we confirm that aspects of both external and internal <b>management</b> <b>matter</b> substantially in Texas while having virtually no effect in Denmark. We therefore suggest that public management research should {{pay more attention to the}} role of contex...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores how general <b>management</b> <b>matters</b> and {{presents}} {{the foundation of}} a theory of general management as a theory of collective performance {{in the presence of the}} general manager. It proposes that general management is the disciplined art of creating a collective performance superior to that which would naturally occur. This brings the relation between management and performance to the fore. It tells us why <b>management</b> <b>matters,</b> not just what management is. General <b>management</b> <b>matters</b> because it creates value by improving collective performance relative to what such performance would be in the absence of general management. This paper goes beyond the dominant sequential model of company performance and refutes the notion the general manager is a designer. It describes a conceptual model, M. EOS, which models company performance as the dynamic interaction between environment, organization and strategy (EOS) that M, the general manager, improves by purposefully intervening to shift EOS. Unlike existing models, M. EOS is not a model of the company but a model of company performance. M. EOS can be used to understand what general managers do or can do in order to fulfill their most fundamental responsibility: augmenting collective performance...|$|R
