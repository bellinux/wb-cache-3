40|$|Abstract. To {{solve the}} problem that {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> components cannot be quickly applied to design process of aircraft, a novel approach based on knowledge is proposed from the instantiated requirements <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> components. Knowledge-based model based on semantic <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> component is described, which is composed of parameters, rules, solid model and assembly information. The information model is expressed and stored based on XML. Knowledge-based model is provided to support the specifications determination, semantic modeling of solid model and batch assembly <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> components by loosely coupled manner. Design knowledge is seamlessly, quickly applied to the instantiated process <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> components. Effectiveness <b>of</b> the proposed model and method is verified by an aircraft design example <b>of</b> <b>standard</b> components...|$|R
5|$|Roosevelt {{decided that}} the letter {{required}} action, and authorized {{the creation of the}} Advisory Committee on Uranium. The committee was chaired by Lyman James Briggs, the Director of the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> (currently the National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> and Technology), with Adamson and Hoover as its other members. It convened {{for the first time on}} October 21. The meeting was also attended by Fred L. Mohler from the Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Standards,</b> Richard B. Roberts of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and Szilárd, Teller and Wigner. Adamson was skeptical about the prospect of building an atomic bomb, but was willing to authorize $6,000 ($100,000 in current USD) for the purchase of uranium and graphite for Szilárd and Fermi's experiment.|$|E
5|$|The {{short-range}} {{committee was}} made up of members representing six computer manufacturers and three government agencies. The six computer manufacturers were Burroughs Corporation, IBM, Minneapolis-Honeywell (Honeywell Labs), RCA, Sperry Rand, and Sylvania Electric Products. The three government agencies were the US Air Force, the Navy's David Taylor Model Basin, and the National Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> (now the National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> and Technology). The committee was chaired by Joseph Wegstein of the US National Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Standards.</b> Work began by investigating data description, statements, existing applications and user experiences.|$|E

5|$|On 10 February 1964, the National Bureau <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> (now the National Institute <b>of</b> <b>Standards</b> and Technology) {{issued a}} {{statement}} that it was to use SI except where this would have an obvious detrimental effect. In 1968 Congress authorised the U.S. Metric Study, the emphasis of which {{was to examine the}} feasibility of adopting SI. The first volume was delivered in 1970. The study recommended that the United States adopt the International System of units, and in 1975 Congress passed the Metric Conversion Act of 1975, which established a national policy of coordinating and planning for the increased use of the metric measurement system in the United States. Metrication was voluntary and to be coordinated by the United States Metric Board (USMB).|$|E

5|$|Acid2 {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Håkon Wium Lie, {{chief technical officer}} of Opera Software and creator of the widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard. In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay that Microsoft Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve a greater degree <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E
