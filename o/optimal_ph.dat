5|$|Azotobacter can fix {{at least}} 10 μg of {{nitrogen}} per gram of glucose consumed. Nitrogen fixation requires molybdenum ions, {{but they can}} be partially or completely replaced by vanadium ions. If atmospheric nitrogen is not fixed, the source of nitrogen can alternatively be nitrates, ammonium ions, or amino acids. The <b>optimal</b> <b>pH</b> for the growth and nitrogen fixation is 7.0–7.5, but growth is sustained in the pH range from 4.8 to 8.5. Azotobacter can also grow mixotrophically, in a molecular-nitrogen-free medium containing mannose; this growth mode is hydrogen-dependent. Hydrogen is available in the soil, thus this growth mode may occur in nature.|$|E

Activation of SMase has been implicated as the cause of elevation of cellular ceramide levels and consequently of apoptosis. The data indicate that there are two classes of SMase, defined by their <b>optimal</b> <b>pHs</b> and cellular locations, existing in H. pylori. One is an Mg 2 +-dependent membrane-bound enzyme with an <b>optimal</b> activity at <b>pH</b> 7, and the other is an Mg 2 +-independent cytosolic enzyme with an <b>optimal</b> activity at <b>pH</b> 5. Bisalumin, a bismuth salt, was found to inhibit the activities of both forms of SMase regardless of the presence of Mg 2 +.
