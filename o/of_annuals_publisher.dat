40|$|Annuals are an {{important}} component part of plant communities in arid and semiarid grassland ecosystems.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of how to {{coordinate}} a one-supplier, multi-retailer supply chain by requiring retailers to adopt the unified number <b>of</b> <b>annual</b> orders proposed by the supplier. The paper presents two coordination models: one considering a small number of retailers; the other considering a large number of retailers. In the proposed models, the supplier views all retailers or some selected retailers (if more beneficial) in the supply chain as one group, then offers a price discount to entice the retailers in this group placing their orders only with the specific number <b>of</b> <b>annual</b> orders. A heuristic is developed for each model to let the supplier know which retailers will be selected to implement the common number <b>of</b> <b>annual</b> orders, and how to determine the corresponding optimal number <b>of</b> <b>annual</b> replenishments and price discount. By using a numerical study, we evaluate the benefit of the proposed coordination strategy. Supply chain coordination Replenishment Discount The unified number <b>of</b> <b>annual</b> orders...|$|R

The conventional method and the set-pair analysis (SPA) method have been adopted in this paper to classify the abundant state and the low state <b>of</b> the <b>annual</b> runoff in Biliuhe reservoir from 1951 to 2005. The {{results show that the}} conventional method only stresses the size <b>of</b> <b>annual</b> runoff, which does not consider the schedule distribution; therefore, the wet-dry classification results are unilateral. However, the SPA method comprehensively emphasizes the two factors and the classification results can better reflect the actual wet-dry situation <b>of</b> <b>annual</b> runoff...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The spatial scaling {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>annual</b> average streamflow {{is examined}} using records from 1 433 river basins across the continental United States. The log-linear relationship ln(E[Q']) = a + brln(A) is representative throughout the United States, where E[Q:] represents {{the expectation of}} the rth moment <b>of</b> <b>annual</b> streamflow at site i, and Â, represents drainage area. The scaling model parameters ar and br follow nearly perfect linear relationships ar = ra, and br = r $ throughout the continental United States. We conclude that the probability distribution <b>of</b> <b>annual</b> streamflow follows simple scaling relationships in all regions of the United States. In temperate regions where climate is relatively homogeneous, scale alone describes most of the variability in the moments <b>of</b> <b>annual</b> streamflow. In the more climatically heterogeneous regions, {{such as in the}} Upper Colorado and Missouri river basins, scale alone is a poor predictor of the moments <b>of</b> <b>annual</b> flow.
