Hiking along waterways and swampy areas, particularly during droughts, can also produce important clues and lead to good discoveries.|$|E
50|$|Grip {{strength}} is the force applied {{by the hand}} to pull on or suspend from objects and is a specific part of hand strength.

Other grip strengths that have been studied are the hammer and <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> <b>tools.</b> In applications of grip strength, the wrist must be in a neutral position to avoid developing cumulative trauma disorders (CTD's).|$|E

50|$|Hafting {{weapons is}} {{perhaps best known for}} its use by humans in prehistory, but it is still {{practice}}d by enthusiasts today and the handle of a tool such as an ax is still known as a haft. Many people still practice the hafting techniques by using old-fashioned methods to figure out the best way to attach a handle onto tools, while improving the overall structure and function. Hafting has evolved through the past and the idea can still be seen in the structure of modern day tools such as hammers, axes, and many <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> <b>tools.</b> The evolution of hand tools such as hammers, and axes would be greatly altered had the people of our past failed to invent the idea of hafting.

Leah’s Yard had many different trade occupants and as such the building underwent many alterations and additions which are evident today. Throughout the 19th century the yard was used by a horn dealer (who supplied the cutlery handle making trade), Sheffield platers, knife manufacturers and silver stampers. In the 1880s the building was known as the Cambridge Street Horn Works. In 1892 Henry Leah took over the building as a producer of die stamps for silverware, giving the building the name that it is known by today. Sharing the building at that time was Walter Walker & Co Ltd, who were piercers and stampers; the building was alternatively known as the Cambridge Stamping Works.|$|E
50|$|Meadowbrook Boulevard in University Heights and Cleveland Heights {{follows the}} winding {{course of the}} upper west branch, having been built on top of its culvert {{at the bottom of}} the stream valley. The west branch of Dugway Brook passes through Cleveland Heights as an open channel at several points within a mile south of and inside {{historic}} Lake View Cemetery, founded in 1869. The cemetery quarried Euclid bluestone, a desirable, dense, finely grained and easily cut variety of sandstone, from the part of the brook situated in Cleveland Heights. Bluestone from the cemetery quarry was used to construct buildings in the cemetery, a massive wall on the western (Mayfield Road) side of the cemetery, steps leading to the tops of small hills, and other structures. Quarrymen worked with picks, iron bars, and <b>other</b> <b>hand</b> <b>tools,</b> and used dynamite. Little stone was wasted; at least during part of the twentieth century, a stone crusher, positioned on a basal layer of stone flooring the quarry, was used to crush scraps to be used as foundations for cemetery monuments. The quarry here was active until the mid-1930s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Multimedia and Web 2. 0 {{can meet}} up. Despite the success they have {{obtained}} in last years, these two domains present some important limitations. In particular, current Web 2. 0 based technologies, such as wikis, blogs, podcasts, commonly resort to sequential combinations of contents, rather than exploiting dynamic and synchronized compositions of discrete and continuous media resources. On the <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>tools</b> for multimedia content authoring and distribution usually lack cooperativeness, interactivity, use of adequate metatagging structures and application mash-up. This paper discusses how by merging these two worlds {{it is possible}} to inherit the advantages while removing their limitations.

Therefore, principles and methods for capturing and representing provenance have been developed over a long time in the archival domain. However, further research in this area is needed to cope with the challenges and opportunities of new technology—on the one hand, the digital environment has made it extremely easy to mix and re-use digital objects, to a point that it is often difficult to trace provenance; on the <b>other</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>tools</b> like Resource Description Framework (RDF) can be used to represent provenance through new standards and models...|$|E
