50|$|In the {{concrete}} construction industry, form release agents prevent the adhesion of freshly placed concrete to the forming surface, usually plywood, <b>overlaid</b> <b>plywood,</b> steel or aluminum. In this application, {{there are two}} types of release agents available: barrier and reactive.|$|E
50|$|Thus in 1947, {{structural}} insulated panel development {{began when}} corrugated paperboard cores were tested with various skin materials of plywood, tempered hardboard and treated paperboard. The building was dismantled in 1978 {{and most of}} the panels retained their original strength with the exception of paperboard which is unsuited to outdoor exposure. Panels consisting of polystyrene core and paper <b>overlaid</b> with <b>plywood</b> skins were used in a building in 1967 and the panels have performed well to the present day.|$|R
5000|$|It is a plywood product, {{with a paper}} face <b>overlaid</b> on the <b>plywood</b> {{substrate}} with an exterior grade (usually) phenolic adhesive. MDO {{is designed}} to have a smooth, paint-receptive surface. One or both faces can be surfaced with paper, and is produced in 4' x 8' sheets from 3/8" [...] to over 3 inches in thickness.|$|R
50|$|Formply, {{a medium}} density <b>overlaid</b> forming {{structural}} <b>plywood</b> {{is suitable for}} concrete formwork. In the House at Big Hill, the dark coloured Formply ceiling is used to intensify the colours of the adjacent bush and distant sea scapes. It {{is known to be}} a durable and strong material. Furthermore, it has a low water transmission rate from a constant water/ cement ratio which results in a harder, denser concrete surface. It is easy to install and maintain and provides a smooth matte-finish that resists grain and patch transfer.|$|R
