5000|$|<b>OutRunners</b> is {{the fourth}} game in the Out Run series, {{following}} Battle Out Run and Turbo Outrun. After Turbo Outruns departure from Out Runs laid-back, charming atmosphere, fans wanted a game that captured {{the spirit of the}} original. <b>OutRunners</b> succeeded in doing this; it brought back the ability to take different paths through forks in the road, returned to a lighthearted atmosphere, and distanced itself well from the [...] "serious" [...] Turbo Outrun. The game featured head-to-head support, and with enough cabinets, up to eight players could challenge each other. It was also the only game in the Out Run series to feature various selectable cars and multiple endings until OutRun 2. <b>OutRunners</b> was the most successful game released for Sega's System Multi 32 hardware, and one of the last successful 2D games released by Sega. <b>OutRunners</b> was also known for having some of the best looking graphics seen at the time, thanks to creative sprite design and a very skillful use of parallax scrolling, similar to that found in Power Drift, released four years earlier. The game holds up very well today, and plays very similarly to a modern polygon based 3D racer, something not common in a racing game that utilises 2D graphics.|$|R

5000|$|Compared to <b>outrunner</b> motors, inrunners tend to spin {{exceptionally}} fast, {{often as}} high as 11000 RPM per volt, far too fast for most aircraft propellers. However, inrunners lack torque. As a result, most inrunners are {{used in conjunction with}} a gearbox in both surface and aircraft models to reduce speed and increase torque ...|$|E
50|$|Usually, outrunners {{have more}} poles, so they spin much slower than their inrunner {{counterparts}} with their more traditional layout (though still considerably faster than ferrite motors) while producing far more torque. This makes an <b>outrunner</b> {{an excellent choice}} for directly driving electric aircraft propellers since they eliminate the extra weight, complexity, inefficiency and noise of a gearbox.|$|E
50|$|The {{stationary}} (stator) windings of an <b>outrunner</b> motor {{are excited}} by conventional DC brushless motor controllers. A direct current (switched {{on and off}} at high frequency for voltage modulation) is typically passed through three or more non-adjacent windings together, and the group so energized is alternated electronically based upon rotor position feedback. The number of permanent magnets in the rotor does not match the number of stator poles, however. This is to reduce Cogging torque and create a sinusoidal back emf. The number of magnet poles divided by 2 gives the ratio of magnetic field frequency to motor rotation frequency.|$|E
5000|$|The term inrunner {{refers to}} a type of {{brushless}} motor used in radio controlled models, especially in reference to their use in aircraft to differentiate them from <b>outrunners.</b>|$|R

50|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} follow-up titles to Out Run, including Out Run 3-D (1988), Turbo Out Run (1989), and <b>OutRunners</b> (1992), among many others. Out Run 2 was released on the Xbox in 2003 to acclaim, and has been followed by further titles.|$|R
50|$|Brushless motors can be {{constructed}} in several different physical configurations: In the 'conventional' (also known as inrunner) configuration, the permanent magnets {{are part of the}} rotor. Three stator windings surround the rotor. In the <b>outrunner</b> (or external-rotor) configuration, the radial-relationship between the coils and magnets is reversed; the stator coils form the center (core) of the motor, while the permanent magnets spin within an overhanging rotor which surrounds the core. The flat or axial flux type, used where there are space or shape limitations, uses stator and rotor plates, mounted face to face. Outrunners typically have more poles, set up in triplets to maintain the three groups of windings, and have a higher torque at low RPMs. In all brushless motors, the coils are stationary.|$|E

50|$|With the {{direct-drive}} method, {{the propeller}} is attached {{directly on the}} engine's spinning crankshaft (or motor shaft). This arrangement is optimum when the propellor and powerplant share overlapping regions of best efficiency (measured in RPM.) Direct-drive {{is by far the}} most common when using a fuel-powered engine (gas or glow). Some electric motors with high torque and (comparatively) low speed can utilize direct-drive as well. These motors are typically <b>outrunners.</b>|$|R
40|$|Motors used {{to actuate}} powered {{prostheses}} generally under-utilize their torque capacity due to thermal {{limitations of the}} windings. This thesis investigates the effectiveness of increasing {{the rate of heat}} transfer away from the windings in order to enable running motors at higher currents than their rated maximum levels, thus raising this torque saturation limit. Simulation models and physical prototypes based on the RCTiger 100 KV U 8 brushless <b>outrunner</b> motor were built to observe the temperature of the windings as constant current was applied to the motor. The addition of a fan-based active cooling system allowed the motor to run at 142 % of its maximum continuous current rating for up to 56 seconds before winding temperatures exceeded 550 C, and limited temperature increase in simulation to 26 ' above ambient temperature when the full 35 A stall current was applied for one second. Although the simplified circuit model was not able to fully capture nonlinear thermal behavior of the motor, simulations were able to predict approximate heating time constants and time duration before windings reached threshold temperature for current ranges 5 - 15 A. Experimental and simulation results support the hypothesis that active cooling enables motors to run at their full torque potential for short periods of time, which holds promise for the use of cooling mechanisms in prosthetic applications. by Ava E.

40|$|A {{series of}} Plio-Pleistocene mass {{transport}} deposits (MTD) {{have been identified}} in the deepwater Taranaki Basin, in New Zealand, using the Romney 3 D seismic survey, which covers an area of approximately 2000 km 2. One of these MTDs has been chosen for description and interpretation based on high confidence mapping of its boundary surfaces. The deposit exhibits an array of interesting features similar to those documented by researchers elsewhere plus a unique basal feature unlike those previously observed. The basal shear surface exhibits erosional features such as grooves, “monkey fingers”, and glide tracks. Internally, the MTD is typically characterized by low impedance, chaotic, semi-transparent reflectors surrounding isolated coherent packages of seismic facies interpreted as intact blocks rafted within the mass transport complex. Distally, the deposit presents <b>outrunner</b> blocks and pressure ridges. The new element described in this work consists of a composite feature that includes a protruding obstacle (“shield block”) on the paleo-seafloor that acted as a barrier to subsequent flows as they advanced downslope. These blocks disrupt the incoming flow and result in elongate, downflow negative features (“erosional shadow scours”), which are then infilled by the mass transport deposit, and are preserved as elongate isochore thicks. Kinematic evidence provided by various structures suggests that the MTD flow direction was SE-NW toward bathyal depths. The features presented and the absence of extensional headwall structures, such as local arcuate glide planes and rotated slide blocks, suggest that this part of the deposit belongs to the translational to distal domain of the MTD, and its source area is expected to be somewhere toward the SE in a paleo continental slope...|$|E
40|$|In the {{previous}} decade, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {{have turned into}} a subject of enthusiasm for some exploration associations. UAVs are discovering applications in different regions going from military applications to activity reconnaissance. This thesis is an overview of a particular sort of UAV called quadrotor or quadcopter. Scientists are often picking quadrotors for their exploration because a quadrotor can precisely and productively perform assignments that future of high hazard for a human pilot to perform. This thesis includes the dynamic models of a quadrotor and model-autonomous control systems. It also explains the complete description of developed quadcopter used for surveillance purpose with real-time object detection. In the present time, the focus has moved to outlining autonomous quadrotors. Ultimately, it examines the potential applications of quadrotors and their part in multi-operators frameworks. The Unmanned aerial vehicle (Quadcopter) has been developed {{that could be used}} for search and surveillance purpose. This project comprised of both hardware and software part.

40|$|Sørfjord {{outside the}} village of Finneidfjord {{has a history of}} landsliding {{throughout}} the Holocene. The 1996 landslide – the focus of this study – has many characteristics typical of submarine landslides (well-developed slip plane, <b>outrunner</b> blocks, peripheral thrusting and lateral spreading). Due to its sheltered and accessible location, Finneidfjord has become a natural laboratory for testing high-resolution and multidisciplinary techniques to improve our understanding of landslide development. This study integrates multiple sediment cores, swath-bathymetry surveys, single- and multi-channel 2 D seismic data (Topas, boomer, sparker, airgun), very-high-resolution 3 D chirp seismics, ocean-bottom seismometer as well as free fall and traditional cone penetration testing (CPTU). The cores have been subjected to both geological and geotechnical laboratory analyses. Of particular interest is the correlation of the regional slip plane as a high-amplitude package of reflections in the geophysical data with the results of the sediment and in situ measurements. Comparison of 3 D traces with synthetic seismograms based on multi-sensor core logs show that the most prominent slip plane lies within a thin clay unit sandwiching a sand seam. The slip plane is difficult to identify from CPTU data alone. The top part of this composite unit has in places been eroded under the 1996 mass-transport deposit (MTD). This composite unit’s formation is associated with turbidite deposits from terrestrial quick clay landslides and possibly river floods in the catchment of the fjord. While the MTD is extensively deformed, different flow facies are identified within the landslide body revealing a complex, multi-phase failure. The seismic data were also used to infer physical properties (mean grain size, gas saturation from P-wave attenuation). Interestingly, shallow gas adjacent to the landslide appears not to {{have played a role in}} the landslide development. Fjordbed stability is strongly influenced by shallow subsurface structure, with geotechnical properties and lateral continuity of stratified beds acting as primary controls on slide plane depth and failure mechanisms. This study can well form a template for near-shore areas prone to landsliding. Currently, a long-term pore pressure monitoring programme is in progress, after the installation of several piezometers close to the depths of the slip plane close to the shoreline in September 2012...|$|E
40|$|Holocene and {{slightly}} pre-Holocene submarine landslide are found both in high-latitude glacial dominated margins and in lower latitude, river-dominated margins. This paper constitutes a major assessment {{on some of}} the best-studied submarine instabilities in the world. We review and update from original data and literature reports the current state of knowledge of Storegga, Traenadjupet and Finneidfjord slides from the mid-Norwegian margin, Afen Slide from the Faeroe-Shetland Channel, BIG’ 95 Slide and Central Adriatic Deformation Belt (CADEB) from continental slope and inner continental shelf settings off the Ebro and Po rivers in the Mediterranean Sea, Canary Slide west of the westernmost, youngest Canary Islands and Gebra Slide off the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula in the southern hemisphere, i. e. those studied in the Continental Slope Stability (COSTA) project. The investigated slides range in size from the gigantic 90, 000 km 2 and almost 3000 km 3 Storegga Slide to the tiny 1 km 2 and 0. 001 km 3 Finneidfjord Slide. Not only do individual submarine landslides rarely involve processes precisely fitting with pre-established categories, mostly based on subaerial research, but also they display complex mechanical behaviors within the elastic and plastic fields. Individual events can involve simultaneous or successive vertical to translational movements including block detachment, block gliding, debris flow, mud flow and turbidity currents. The need for an in-depth revision of the classification criteria, and eventually for a new classification system, based on the new imaging capabilities provided by modern techniques, is more than obvious. We suggest a new system, which, for the moment, is restricted to debris flows and debris avalanches. Volume calculation methods are critically reviewed and the relations between some key geomorphic parameters are established for the selected slides. The assumed volume missing from scar areas does not necessarily match the actual volume of sediment remobilised by an individual event since in situ sediment can be remoulded and eventually incorporated during the slide downslope journey. CADEB, a shore-parallel prodelta detached from its source, is the exception to the good correlation found between across slope width and alongslope length with slide area. Height drop measured from the headwall upper rim to its foot correlates with the debris deposit maximum thickness unless the slide moves into restricted areas, which prevent farther forward expansion of the deposit, such as Gebra and BIG’ 95. In such cases, bover-thickenedQ deposits are found. A particularly loose and fluid behavior can be deduced for slides showing an bover-thinnedQ character, such as the Canary Slide that traveled 600 km. Scar areas and slip planes have been investigated with particular emphasis. Although slide headwalls might present locally steep gradients (up to 238 for Storegga Slide), the slope gradients of both the failed segment margins and the main slip planes are very low (max. 28 and usually around 18 and less). An exception is the Finneidfjord Slide (208 –b 58) that occurred in 1996 because of a combination of climatic and anthropogenic factors leading to excess pore pressure and failure. Mechanically distinct, low permeable clayey bweak layersQ often correspond to slip planes beyond the slide headwall. Since not only formation of these bweak layersQ but also sedimentation rates are climatically controlled, we can state that slide pre-conditioning is climatically driven too. Run-out distances reflect the degree of disintegration of the failed mass of sediment, the total volume of initially failed material and transport mechanisms, including hydroplanning. Commonly, specific run-outs could be attributed to distinct elements, such as cohesive blocks and looser matrix, as nicely illustrated by the BIG’ 95 Slide. Total run-outs usually correspond to matrix run-outs since the coarser elements tend to rest at shorter distances. <b>Outrunner</b> blocks are, finally, a very common feature proving the ability of those elements to glide over long distances with independence {{of the rest of the}} failed mass. In addition to pre-conditioning factors related to geological setting and sedimentation conditions, a final trigger is required for submarine landslides to take place, which is most often assumed to be an earthquake. In high latitude margins, earthquake magnitude intensification because of post-glacial isostatic rebound has likely played a major role in triggering landslides. Although it cannot be totally ruled out, there is little proof, at least amongst the COSTA slides, that gas hydrate destabilization or other processes linked to the presence of shallow gas have acted as final triggers...|$|E

Brushless motors, otherwise called <b>outrunners</b> or inrunners depending on their physical configuration, have become very popular with [...] "electroflight" [...] radio-control aeromodeling hobbyists because of their efficiency, power, longevity and light weight in comparison to traditional brushed motors.
