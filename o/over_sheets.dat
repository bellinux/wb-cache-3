60|$|I had recollections, too, of {{fair and}} fertile holms, or level plains, {{extending}} between the wooded {{banks and the}} bold stream of the Clyde, which, coloured like pure amber, or rather having the hue of the pebbles called Cairngorm, rushes <b>over</b> <b>sheets</b> of rock and beds of gravel, inspiring a species of awe from the few and faithless fords which it presents, {{and the frequency of}} fatal accidents, now diminished by the number of bridges. These alluvial holms were frequently bordered by triple and quadruple rows of large trees, which gracefully marked their boundary, and dipped their long arms into the foaming stream of the river. Other places I remembered, which had been described by the old huntsman as the lodge of tremendous wild-cats, or the spot where tradition stated the mighty stag to have been brought to bay, or where heroes, whose might was now as much forgotten, were said to have been slain by surprise, or in battle.|$|E

60|$|I was one summer's day {{loitering}} {{through the}} great saloons of the British Museum, with that listlessness with which one is apt to saunter about a museum in warm weather; sometimes lolling over the glass cases of minerals, sometimes studying the hieroglyphics on an Egyptian mummy, and some times trying, with nearly equal success, to comprehend the allegorical paintings on the lofty ceilings. Whilst I was gazing about in this idle way, my attention was attracted to a distant door, {{at the end of}} a suite of apartments. It was closed, but every now and then it would open, and some strange-favored being, generally clothed in black, would steal forth, and glide through the rooms, without noticing any of the surrounding objects. There was an air of mystery about this that piqued my languid curiosity, and I determined to attempt the passage of that strait, and to explore the unknown regions beyond. The door yielded to my hand, with all that facility with which the portals of enchanted castles yield to the adventurous knight-errant. I found myself in a spacious chamber, surrounded with great cases of venerable books. Above the cases, and just under the cornice, were arranged a great number of black-looking portraits of ancient authors. About the room were placed long tables, with stands for reading and writing, at which sat many pale, studious personages, poring intently over dusty volumes, rummaging among mouldy manuscripts, and taking copious notes of their contents. A hushed stillness reigned through this mysterious apartment, excepting that you might hear the racing of pens <b>over</b> <b>sheets</b> of paper, and occasionally the deep sigh of one of these sages, as he shifted his position to turn over the page of an old folio; doubtless arising from that hollowness and flatulency incident to learned research.|$|E
60|$|Archie {{found himself}} alone. The {{last of the}} faithful--or was it only the boldest of the curious?--had fled. He watched the black huddle of his fellow-students draw off down and up the street, in {{whispering}} or boisterous gangs. And {{the isolation of the}} moment weighed upon him like an omen and an emblem of his destiny in life. Bred up in unbroken fear himself, among trembling servants, and in a house which (at the least ruffle in the master's voice) shuddered into silence, he saw himself on the brink of the red valley of war, and measured the danger and length of it with awe. He made a détour in the glimmer and shadow of the streets, came into the back stable lane, and watched for a long while the light burn steady in the judge's room. The longer he gazed upon that illuminated window-blind, the more blank became the picture of the man who sat behind it, endlessly turning <b>over</b> <b>sheets</b> of process, pausing to sip a glass of port, or rising and passing heavily about his book-lined walls to verify some reference. He could not combine the brutal judge and the industrious, dispassionate student; the connecting link escaped him; from such a dual nature it was impossible he should predict behaviour; and he asked himself if he had done well to plunge into a business of which the end could not be foreseen? and presently after, with a sickening decline of confidence, if he had done loyally to strike his father? For he had struck him--defied him twice over and before a cloud of witnesses--struck him a public buffet before crowds. Who had called him to judge his father in these precarious and high questions? The office was usurped. It might have become a stranger; in a son--there was no blinking it--in a son, it was disloyal. And now, between these two natures so antipathetic, so hateful to each other, there was depending an unpardonable affront: and the providence of God alone might foresee {{the manner in which it}} would be resented by Lord Hermiston.|$|E

50|$|Vark, {{also called}} varak (also silver leaf, German paper) is any leaf {{composed}} of pure metals, typically silver but sometimes gold, used on South Asian sweets. The silver is edible, though flavorless. Varak {{is made by}} pounding silver into sheets, a few micrometres (µm) thick, typically 0.2 µm-0.8 µm. The sheets are typically backed with paper for support; this paper is peeled away before use. It is fragile and breaks into smaller pieces if handled with direct skin contact. Those leaves in the 0.2 µm thickness tend to adhere to skin if handled directly (due to thickness close to inter-atomic distance). Vark sheets are laid or rolled over some South Asian sweets. Edible silver and gold foils on sweets, confectionery and desserts {{is not unique to}} the Indian subcontinent; other regions such as Japan and Europe have long used precious metal foils as food cover and as decoration, including specialty drinks such as Danziger Goldwasser. It is also commonly used in India as coating on dry fruits (such as almonds, cashews, and dates), and in sugar balls, betel nuts, cardamom and other spices. Cardamom-coated sweets are very commonly present in the market. Concerns have been raised about the safety and ethical acceptability of Vark, as not all of it is pure silver, nor hygienically prepared, and the foil nowadays commonly is beaten between layers of ox-gut because it is easier to separate the silver leaf from animal tissue than to separate it from paper. It is considerable that some technologies evolved for the production of silver leaves i.e. in Russia, Germany, China and India. Technologies like beating <b>over</b> <b>sheets</b> of black special treated paper, polyester sheets coated with food grade calcium powder are used instead of ox-guts. Estimated consumption of Vark is 275 tons (according to BWC-Beauty without cruelty data) annually. Hindu and Jain religions are mostly vegetarian, thus the Indian market for Vark has mostly converted to using the vegetarian process in the making of the silver leaves.|$|E

It is {{expressed in terms of}} magnetic monopole field correlators represented as sums <b>over</b> <b>sheets</b> of center vortices. Our construction establishes a link between “abelian ” and “center dominance”. It avoids an inconsistency in the treatment of small scales present in earlier definitions of monopole fields by respecting Dirac’s quantization condition for magnetic fluxes. 1. Abelian and center dominance It is widely believed that confinement in SU(2) Yang-Mills theory is due to condensation of topological defects, but it is still debated whether the relevant defects are center vortices or magnetic monopoles. In the first scenario [1] confinement is usually discussed in terms of area decay for the Wilson loop. In lattice theory, the location of vortex sheets giving rise to area law have been identified with surfaces of plaquettes, p, where sign[TrU∂p] = − 1 (thin vortices), [2]. Here Uµ denotes the SU(2) -gauge field, and U∂p the Wilson plaquette, [more precisely, if p is described by a lattice site x and two direction µ, ν then U∂p ≡ Uµν(x) ≡ Uµ(x) Uν(x+ ˆν) U † (x+ ˆν) U † ν(x) ]. However it was later proved [3] that close to the continuum, at zero temperature, thin vortices form a dilute gas and hence they are unable to induce an area decay of the Wilson loop. Therefore, to explain confinement, one needs to invoke either “thick vortices ” [4], where sign[TrUL] = − 1 for loops L comprising more than four links, or, presumably equivalently [5], P-vortices which are defined as follows [6]: one introduces a gauge fixing (maximal center gauge) by maximizin...|$|E
40|$|Aluminum sheets {{produced}} by continuous casting (CC) provide energy and economic savings {{of at least}} 25 and 14 percent, respectively, <b>over</b> <b>sheets</b> made from conventional direct chill (DC) ingot casting and rolling. As {{a result of the}} much simpler production route in continuous casting, however, the formability of CC aluminum alloys is often somewhat inferior to that of their DC counterparts. The mechanical properties of CC alloys can be improved by controlling their microstructure through optimal thermomechanical processing. Suitable annealing is an important means to improve the formability of CC aluminum alloy sheets. Recrystallization of deformed grains occurs during annealing, and it changes the crystallographic texture of the aluminum sheet. Laboratory tests in this project showed that this texture change can be detected by either laser-ultrasound resonance spectroscopy or resonance EMAT (electromagnetic acoustic transducer) spectroscopy, and that monitoring this change allows the degree of recrystallization or the ''recrystallized fraction'' in an annealed sheet to be ascertained. Through a plant trial conducted in May 2002, this project further demonstrated that it is feasible to monitor the recrystallized state of a continuous-cast aluminum sheet in-situ on the production line by using a laser-ultrasound sensor. When used in conjunction with inline annealing, inline monitoring of the recrystallized fraction by laser-ultrasound resonance spectroscopy offers the possibility of feed-back control that helps optimize processing parameters (e. g., annealing temperature), detect production anomalies, ensure product quality, and further reduce production costs of continuous-cast aluminum alloys. Crystallographic texture strongly affects the mechanical anisotropy/formability of metallic sheets. Clarification of the quantitative relationship between texture and anisotropy/formability of an aluminum alloy will render monitoring and control of its texture during the sheet production process even more meaningful. The present project included a study to determine how the anisotropic plastic behavior of a continuous-cast AA 5754 aluminum alloy depends on quantifiable texture coefficients. Formulae which show explicitly the effects of texture on the directional dependence of the q-value (a formability parameter) and of the uniaxial flow stress, respectively, were derived. Measurements made on a batch of as-received AA 5754 hot band and its O-temper counterpart corroborate the validity of these formulae. On the other hand, these measurements also indicate that some microstructure(s) other than texture could {{play a significant role in}} the plastic anisotropy of the AA 5754 alloy. For the q-value of a set of O-temper samples of this alloy, the additional microstructure that affects plastic anisotropy was shown to be grain shape. A formula that captures both the effects of crystallographic texture and grain shape on the q-value of the O-temper material was derived. A simple quadratic plastic potential that delivers this q-value formula was written down. Verification of the adequacy of this plastic potential, however, requires further investigations...|$|E
