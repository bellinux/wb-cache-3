It raises concerns about whether the EU <b>origin</b> <b>declaration</b> can be trusted at this time of economic crisis which has severely influenced exchange rates. The analysis performed using a simplified model of a product manufactured in the EU and imported to the RSA under preferential duty treatment provides insight into how easily commercial fraud can be committed, even unintentionally, by EU exporters of goods at this time of economic turmoil. 1...|$|E

In the 1950s, the Church's {{position}} was one of neutrality; by the late 20th century its position evolved to one of general acceptance of evolution. , the Church's official position is a fairly non-specific example of theistic evolution.

The report {{illustrates}} the basic structure of a system that could produce strict and reliable data needed for generating product-oriented carbon footprints in Finland. It also represents a road map for developing the system for the energy and food sectors. Steering mechanisms, standards and possible data sources central to the system are also reviewed. Accuracy and a scope of the outlined system should be developed step by step, starting from the major emission sources, processes and products. Account has also been taken of linkages between the proposed system and existing environmental management systems, annual reporting practices and the European emission-trading scheme (EU-ETS).

Some players, especially Kosovo Serbs (such as Miloš Krasić and Milan Biševac), continued to play for the Serbia national football team. A new meeting was planned to be held at FIFA on 27 and 28 September in which the Kosovo issue was again planned to be discussed, which was then postponed until December.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: the {{historical}} milestone protection human rights. The aim of the thesis {{is to find out}} how the Universal Declaration of Human Rights influences social rights, and what its influence on the current situation is. The thesis is structured into seven chapters. The first chapter {{deals with the}} development of human right conception, describing the development of thinking that has been dealing with the origin and protection of human rights. The history is being described {{from the beginning of the}} 20 th century. Most attention is paid to the <b>origin</b> of Universal <b>Declaration</b> of Human Rights, which has inspired a further development of human rights the part of which now are also social rights. The third chapter describes the origin of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights itself, and its division. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights may be divided into five groups. It is divided among political, economic, civil, social, and cultural rights. The fourth chapter is devoted to the reflection of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in other documents, especially in the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, European Social Charter, and in other important conventions dealing with human rights. The fifth chapter is devoted to social rights themselves, the development of social rights, sources and the basic divisions of social rights. The penultimate chapter describes international organizations dealing with social rights, such as the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, and the Council of Europe. The last chapter discusses violating human and social rights nowadays. There are some examples of right violation since 2015. Among other things, I have focused also on discriminating women in the workplace, mentioning the problem of ´glass ceiling´ and gender issues...|$|R

This book addresses {{the topic of the}} scope and impact of Europeanization on national legislation, {{as a part of the}} Europeanization debate which raises normative concerns linked to the "democratic deficit" debate. This state-of-the-art book shows that there are many assumptions and claims on how European integration may affect national legislation and, more generally, domestic governance but that there is a lack of solid and comparative data to test them. The aim of the book is to give a solid and comparative insight into Europeanization focusing on effective outcomes in a systematic way. This book analyzes the period 1986 - 2008 and includes an introduction, a global overview of European legislative activities which set the background for Europeanization of national legislatures, 9 country contributions (8 EU member states + Switzerland) including systematic, comparative and standardized data, tables and figures, and a conclusion with a comparative analysis of the European and domestic reasons for Europeanization. All national contributions conclude that Europeanization of national legislation is much more limited than assumed in the literature and public debate. It is limited to 10 to 30 per cent of laws (depending on the country), far less than the 80 per cent predicted by Jacques Delors and mentioned daily by medias and public opinion leaders to demonstrate EU domination on member states. Beside that general statement, the various chapters propose a deep insight on EU constraint over national legislation, providing much information on the kind of laws and policies that are Europeanized, the evolution of this process through time, the impact of Europeanization on the balance of powers and the relations between majority and opposition at national level, the strategies developed by national institutions in that context, and many other issues, making the book of interest to academics and policy-makers concerned with Europeanization and national legislation...|$|R
