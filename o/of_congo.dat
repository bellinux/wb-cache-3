5|$|The {{government}} {{in the capital city}} Kinshasa, the United Nations, the European Union, and bilateral partners which include Angola, South Africa, and Belgium are attempting to create a viable force with the ability to provide the Democratic Republic <b>of</b> <b>Congo</b> with stability and security.

5|$|A 20-day study held by BirdLife International {{discovered}} 265 {{species of}} birds in the park. Of these, the yellow-bellied form of forest robin is widespread. In the study, a pair of Ja River scrub warblers was discovered in a 1 hectare patch of Rhynchospora marsh; its population must be small as there are few such marshes in Nki. Three species of forest nightjar have been observed in the park; Bate's and brown nightjars are common in southeastern Cameroon, while a rarer and unidentified third species' call has been heard twice. It is likely that this is Prigogine's nightjar, as its voice is identical {{to that of the}} only known specimen of this species which was found in the Democratic Republic <b>of</b> <b>Congo.</b> Two small owls, Sjostedt's and African barred owlets coexist in Nki, due to similar habitat requirements.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the origins}} of the recent {{conflict}} in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo stems from the turmoil following the Rwandan Genocide of 1994, which then led to the Great Lakes refugee crisis. Within the largest refugee camps, beginning in Goma in Nord-Kivu, were Rwandan Hutu fighters, who were eventually organised into the Rassemblement Démocratique pour le Rwanda, who launched repeated attacks into Rwanda. Rwanda eventually backed Laurent-Désiré Kabila and his quickly organised Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation <b>of</b> <b>Congo</b> in invading Zaire, aiming to stop the attacks on Rwanda in the process of toppling Mobutu's government. When the militias rebelled, backed by Rwanda, the FAZ, weakened as is noted above, proved incapable of mastering the situation and preventing the overthrow of Mobutu in 1997.|$|E
