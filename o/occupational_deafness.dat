5000|$|Common {{types of}} {{personal}} injury claims include road traffic accidents, work accidents, tripping accidents, assault claims, and product defect accidents (product liability). The term personal injury also incorporates medical and dental accidents (which lead to medical negligence claims [...] ) and {{conditions that are}} often classified as industrial disease cases, including asbestosis and peritoneal mesothelioma, chest diseases (e.g., emphysema, pneumoconiosis, silicosis, chronic bronchitis, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic obstructive airways disease), vibration white finger, <b>occupational</b> <b>deafness,</b> occupational stress, contact dermatitis, and repetitive strain injury cases. Of these, the most common are automobile collisions. Personal injury cases may also include toxic torts, in which a contaminant transmitted by air or water causes illness, injury, or death (as in John Grisham's book, A Civil Action).|$|E
40|$|Introduction: A pilot return-to-work program {{based on}} the concept of work {{readiness}} and three-month job placement with support was developed to enable people with <b>occupational</b> <b>deafness</b> to return to the workforce. Methods: A convenient sample of six male persons with <b>occupational</b> <b>deafness</b> completed the program. A Pretest-Posttest Single Group Design was utilized to measure the program outcome. Two instruments: the Chinese version of SF- 36 Health Assessment Questionnaire and the Chinese version of Lam's Assessment of Stage of employment readiness were used to measure the participants' health status and their work readiness respectively. Results: The preliminary findings indicated that the six participants showed improvement in their general health and work readiness. The employment outcome indicated that three of the participants had secured a job and another two participants had attained job offers. Conclusion: This pilot study suggested that a systematic vocational rehabilitation program can facilitate persons with <b>occupational</b> <b>deafness</b> to return to the workforce. Further research using a controlled investigation with larger sample size is recommended for evidence-based practice even though the results of this return-to-work program appear promising.

40|$|The {{research}} {{set out to}} test {{three main}} hypotheses derived from a summary of literature {{relevant to the use}} of audiometry in industry. These hypotheses were: (1) performing audiometry increases the probability that hearing protectors, once issued, will be worn; (2) audiometry is considered by workers to be evidence of their employer's concern for their welfare; (3) audiometry is associated with common law claims by workers against employers for alleged <b>occupational</b> <b>deafness.</b> Six subsidiary hypotheses were also developed. Four methods of data collection were used: (1) attitude questionnaires were administered to samples of workers drawn from an industrial company performing audiometry and two industrial companies not performing audiometry; (2) a postal questionnaire was sent out to industrial medical officers; (3) surveys were undertaken to assess the proportion of the workforce in each of eight industrial companies that was wearing personal hearing protectors that had been provided; (4) structured interviews were carried out with relevant management level personnel in each of five industrial companies. Factor analysis was the main statistical analytic technique used. The data supported all three main hypotheses. Audiometry was also examined as an example of medical screening procedure. It was argued that the validation of medical screening procedures requires the satisfaction of attitudinal or motivational validation criteria in addition to the biological and economic criteria currently used. It was concluded that industrial audiometry failed to satisfy such attitudinal or motivational criteria and so should not be part of a programme of screening for <b>occupational</b> <b>deafness.</b> It was also concluded that industrial audiometry may be useful in creating awareness, amongst workers, of <b>occupational</b> <b>deafness.</b> It was argued that the only profitable approach to investigating the role of audiometry in preventing <b>occupational</b> <b>deafness</b> is to study the attitudes and perceptions of everyone involved...|$|E
40|$|From {{its very}} beginning, {{agriculture}} {{has been associated}} with hazards. Most hazards associated with early-day farmers were linked with animals. Today’s highly mechanized agriculture has greatly increased the number of perils, many of them related to tractors and machinery. One type of hazard which is evolving from modern farming methods is that of <b>occupational</b> <b>deafness</b> caused by tractor noise. This is a by-product of farm mechanization, and unless future tractors are quieter than those presently in use, the incidence of this occupational disease will increase. Unlike many physical injuries, <b>occupational</b> <b>deafness</b> usually occurs without discomfort or pain in the ears. Because of this most people affected are unaware of any hearing loss until the noise exposure has been of sufficient severity and duration to cause considerable hearing damage. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} analyze the effects of the tractor exhaust stack location on the noise levels at the operator’s station. Advisor: G. W. Steinbruegg...|$|E
40|$|This work {{aimed to}} compare <b>occupational</b> <b>deafness</b> intwo major {{industrial}} countries: Italy and France. Prevention {{remains the only}} way of reducing theincidence of this incurable disorder. The techniques forassessing hypoacusia are comparable in the twocountries. The conditions for recognising hypoacusia asan occupational illness and its definition are morestringent in France than in Italy. This leads to morejudicial litigations in Italy and, as far as they can beassessed, direct financial consequences in Italy aremore significant than in France. Joint legislation seems desirable for all countries in theEuropean Community. Prat Organ Soins 2006; 37 (3) : 227 - 3...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the current}} {{problems}} in compensating workers for loss of hearing due to exposure to excessive noise {{is the lack of}} a wholly satisfactory handicap evaluation procedure. In this paper the various schemes currently in use are described; these include formulae to calculate percentage handicap from a pure-tone audiogram and the more subjective methods used in civil court proceedings. Discussion with lawyers engaged in litigation in this area has shown a desire for some system by which claimants can be classified into groups, each group being associated with a clear description of the extent of the handicap involved. A grouping scheme of this type, which has been developed over some years experience in this field, is put forward. The growing incidence of successful claims for compensation for <b>occupational</b> <b>deafness</b> ha...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the optimising of hearing protector selection. A computer model was used to estimate the reduction in noise exposure and risk of <b>occupational</b> <b>deafness</b> provided by the wearing of hearing protectors in industrial noise spectra. The model was used to show that low attenuation hearing protectors con provide greater protection than high attenuation protectors if the high attenuation protectors ore not worn for the total duration of noise exposure; or not used by a small proportion of the population. The model was also used to show that high attenuation protectors will not necessarily provide significantly greater reduction in risk than low attenuation protectors if the population has been exposed to the noise for many years prior to the provision of hearing protectors. The effects of earplugs and earmuffs on the localisation of sounds were studied to determine whether high attenuation earmuffs are likely to have greater potential than the lower attenuation earplugs for affecting personal safety. Laboratory studies and experiments at a foundry with normal-hearing office employees and noise-exposed foundrymen who had some experience of wearing hearing protectors showed that although earplugs reduced the ability of the wearer to determine the direction of warning sounds, earmuffs produced more total angular error and more confusions between left and right. !t is concluded from the research findings that the key to the selection of hearing protectors {{is to be found in}} the provision of hearing protectors that can be worn for a very high percentage of the exposure time by a high percentage of the exposed population with the minimum effect on the personal safety of the wearers - the attenuation provided by the protection should be adequate but not a maximum value...|$|E
