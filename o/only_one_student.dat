Ostensibly, it is to help the government and its military research survival skills and battle readiness - in actuality, it is meant to instill terror and distrust in all of Japan's citizens to curb any attempts at rebellion, by showcasing the government's power and ability to target citizen's families and preying on the fear of being killed by a friend.|$|E
2500|$|The film, {{based on}} the actual events {{recorded}} in history as the [...] "Night of the pencils" [...] (La noche de los lápices), {{tells the story of}} seven students who, after protesting for lower bus fares in the city of La Plata, were abducted in September 1976, during Argentina's last dictatorship (1976 - 1983), and subsequently disappeared. <b>Only</b> <b>one</b> <b>student</b> survived to tell what happened.|$|E

2500|$|Khungpo Neljor then {{returned}} to Tibet, and established a monastery at Zhangzhong in the Shang region in western Tsang. This was his main seat, and he {{became known as the}} Lama of Shang. Although he was reputed to have founded hundreds of monasteries and had thousands of students, he passed the teachings of Niguma to only one of his students, Mochok Rinchen Tsondru. The Shangpa lineage {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "secret lineage" [...] because Niguma instructed Khyungpo Neljor to transmit the teachings to <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>student</b> for the first seven generations beginning with Vajradhara and Niguma. Niguma then passed the lineage to Khyungpo Neljor who passed it to Mokchokpa Rinchen Tsondru (1110-1170). After that, Niguma's lineage went to Wonton Kyergngpa (or Chokyi Senge, 1143-1216), Sangye Nyenton (or Rigongpa, 1175-1247/1255?), and Drogon Sangye Tonpa (1207-1278). At this point, the lineage stream was opened up and teachings and practices were given to many others.|$|E
2500|$|Returning to England, he {{was head}} of the history {{department}} at Kelly College in Tavistock for five years, followed by fourteen years at Culham College of Education as principal lecturer and head of the history department. He was able to combine his love of cricket with his college duties by instituting the biannual cricket matches between the History Department and his village cricket team of North Moreton for whom he was wicketkeeper and captain. One regularly told story was that he conducted an interview out on the cricket square when one potential teaching student applied who was already on the books of Yorkshire Cricket Club! Unfortunately for Howat, the student did not take up the place which was presumably offered to him, but did go on to have a reasonably successful cricket career. He had an abrupt tutoring technique and once (at least) locked the door when the time of his tutor group was due to start which left <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>student</b> in the room (at the magnificent mansion of Nuneham) to enjoy his didactic and engaging teaching style. Meanwhile, he undertook a research degree on [...] "the place of history in education" [...] for Exeter College, Oxford. He also turned his hand to the world of publishing, for a time being general editor of the Historical Division of Pergamon Press.|$|E

There was <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>student</b> unladylike and musical enough to whistle; and Miss Wilson was ashamed to find herself growing nervous at the prospect of an encounter with Agatha, who entered whistling sweetly, but with a lugubrious countenance.
