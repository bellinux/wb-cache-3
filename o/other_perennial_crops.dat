AppleBreed DB could serve as a generic database design for <b>other</b> <b>perennial</b> <b>crops</b> with long economic lifespans, long juvenile periods and clonal propagation. Results: AppleBreed DB is organized as a relational database. The core element is the GENOTYPE entity, which has two sub-classes at the physical level: TREE and DNA-SAMPLE. This approach facilitates all links between plant material, phenotypic and molecular data. The entities TREE, DNA-SAMPLE, PHENOTYPE and MOLECULAR DATA allow multi-annual observations to be stored as individual samples of individual trees, even if the nature of these observations differs greatly (e. g. molecular data on parts of the apple genome, physico-chemical measurements of fruit quality traits, and evaluation of disease resistance). AppleBreed DB also includes synonyms for cultivars and pedigrees. Finally, it can be loaded and explored through the web, and comes with tools to present basic statistical overviews and with validation procedures for phenotypic and marker data to certify data quality.

40|$|Weed {{problems}} can constrain {{organic crop production}} resulting in significant losses in yield and quality. Especially perennial weed species such as Elytrigia repens, Cirsium arvense and Tussilago farfara are posing problems as arable cropping systems do not hamper their vegetative proliferation sufficiently. Annual weeds may also reach unacceptable infestation levels leaving the growers with poor yielding crops and severe future weed problems owing to the shedding and spread of weed seeds. Effective weed management is a key component for successful organic crop production and a prerequisite to increase the yielding potential of many organic crop production systems. Weed problems are most severe on stockless arable farms because the supply of nutrients can be limited and may not suffice to produce competitive crop stands. Crop rotations in arable cropping systems often have fewer grass-clovers leys or <b>other</b> <b>perennial</b> <b>crops</b> known to disrupt weed proliferation more effectively than cash crops such as cereals and pulses.

This situation has assumed particular importance because approximately 40 % of the world's cocoa production occurs in C�te d'Ivoire. Concerned parties have since taken great interest in this thorny issue. There {{is a need to}} better understand the reality of child labor utilization in this sector. This article investigates child labor issues in the cocoa sector of C�te d'Ivoire in conjunction with schooling status of children. The study is based on a survey done in 2002, over a representative sample of more than 11, 000 members of cocoa households. The multinomial logit model is used to capture choice probabilities across work and/or school options. The results reveal that child labor in cocoa farms and nonenrollment in schools are significant. Moreover, many children are involved in potentially dangerous and/or harmful tasks. Data also highlight gender and age dimensions in the participation of children in tasks and the way labor is allocated. Econometric results generally indicate that the gender and age of children, whether or not the child is the biological child of the household head, parents' education, the origin of the farmer, household welfare, household size, the household dependency ratio, the size of <b>other</b> <b>perennial</b> <b>crop</b> farms, the number of sharecroppers working with the household head, and communities' characteristics are all pertinent in explaining the child work/schooling outcome in the cocoa sector of C�te d'Ivoire.

Many studies in the literature have focused on climate change impacts on major annual crops; however, to date, comprehensive assessments of the economic impacts of weather variations on <b>perennial</b> <b>crops</b> are rare. In this paper, we use monthly panel data from 40 different tea estates in Sri Lanka over a 15 -year period to analyse weather effects on production from the tea plantation sector. Specifically, we use a two-stage panel data approach to explore how tea production in Sri Lanka is affected by both short-term weather variations and long-term climate change. Overall, our findings show that a hotter and wetter climate will have a detrimental effect on Sri Lankan tea production. In high, medium, and low emissions futures, our predictions show a negative proportional impact from increased rainfall and increased average temperature. Under a high emissions scenario, by mid-century, a decline of 12 % in annual tea production is predicted. <b>Other</b> climate-susceptible <b>perennial</b> <b>crops</b> such as rubber, coconut, and oil palm play similarly major roles in the economies of other developing countries, suggesting that our approach could usefully be replicated elsewhere.

40|$|In {{perennial}} crops, post-wintering reserves play a {{key role}} on regrowth rate and productivity of the crops. The present study aimed at assessing the impact of Miscanthus x giganteus management (harvest date and nitrogen fertilisation) on the subsequent regrowth of the crop via their effects on the nitrogen stocks of belowground organs. The crop growth analysis was conducted by studying radiation use efficiency of the crop and kinetics of leaf area index expansion. Data showed that decreasing nitrogen stocks via early harvest of the crop and no fertilisation had a negative effect on subsequent regrowth. A linear relationship was observed between the leaf area index and the aboveground nitrogen accumulation in the crop, similarly to other crops. The growth rate of the leaf area index depended on the belowground nitrogen stocks before regrowth. A linear relationship followed by a plateau was found between the aerial radiation use efficiency of M. giganteus and the belowground nitrogen stocks before regrowth, as observed in <b>other</b> <b>perennial</b> <b>crops.</b> Finally, it appeared that low nitrogen availability affects more resource conversion than resource capture of M. giganteus.

Twenty-four isolates of C. kahawae were also assessed using amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP). Vegetative compatibility within a collection of nine isolates, including two of C. gloeosporioides was also assessed. All isolates of C. kahawae from across Africa failed to metabolize citrate or tartrate, but all other isolates metabolized one or both. Colletotrichum kahawae isolates also showed minimal variability using the molecular techniques with two isolates from Cameroon showing slightly different banding patterns in RFLP analysis. All other isolates had variable VNTR and RFLP banding patterns. AFLP analysis failed to detect variability within 12 isolates from Kenya, but did detect differences between isolates from other countries. Five isolates from Kenya were vegetatively compatible but differed from two from Cameroon and from two C. gloeosporioides isolates.

40|$|Genomic Selection (GS) {{has been}} studied in several crops with {{potential}} to increase the rates of genetic gain and reduce the length of breeding cycle. Despite the relevance, there is a modest number of reports applied to the genus Coffea. Nevertheless, the effective implementation depends {{on the ability to}} consider genomic models that represent with adequate reliability the breeding scenario in which the specie are inserted. Coffee experimentation, in general, is represented for evaluations in multiples sites and harvests (MET), {{in order to understand the}} interaction magnitude and predicting the performance of untested genotypes. Therefore, the main objective of this study was investigate GS models that accommodate MET modeling. A expansion of the traditional GBLUP was proposed in order to accommodate the interactions in the GS model. Different scenarios that mimic the coffee breeding and models commonly used in the analysis were compared. In terms of goodness of fit this approach showed the lowest AIC and BIC values and, consequently, the best goodness of fit. The predictive capacity was measured by cross-validation and, in contrast with the GBLUP, the incorporation of the MET modeling showed higher predictive accuracy (on average 10 - 17 % higher) and lower prediction errors. All the genomic analysis were performed using the Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach, which showed a good potential to be used in coffee breeding programs.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of crop yield losses {{is needed for}} the improvement of production systems that contribute to the incomes of rural families and food security worldwide. However, efforts to quantify yield losses and identify their causes are still limited, especially for perennial crops. Our objectives were to quantify primary yield losses (incurred in the current year of production) and secondary yield losses (resulting from negative impacts of the previous year) of coffee due to pests and diseases, and to identify the most important predictors of coffee yields and yield losses. We established an experimental coffee parcel with full-sun exposure that consisted of six treatments, which were defined as different sequences of pesticide applications. The trial lasted three years (2013 – 2015) and yield components, dead productive branches, and foliar pests and diseases were assessed as predictors of yield. First, we calculated yield losses by comparing actual yields of specific treatments with the estimated attainable yield obtained in plots which always had chemical protection. Second, we used structural equation modeling to identify the most important predictors. Results showed that pests and diseases led to high primary yield losses (26 %) and even higher secondary yield losses (38 %). We identified the fruiting nodes and the dead productive branches as the most important and useful predictors of yields and yield losses. These predictors could be added in existing mechanistic models of coffee, or can be used to develop new linear mixed models to estimate yield losses. Estimated yield losses can then be related to production factors to identify corrective actions that farmers can implement to reduce losses. The experimental and modeling approaches of this study could also be applied in <b>other</b> <b>perennial</b> <b>crops</b> to assess yield losses. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Production of {{commodities}} for global markets is {{an increasingly important}} factor of tropical deforestation, taking over smallholders subsistence farming. Measures to reduce deforestation and convert shifting cultivation systems towards permanent crops have recently been strengthened in several countries. But these changes have variable environmental and social impacts, including on ethnic minorities. In Vietnam, although a forest transition – i. e. shift from shrinking to expanding forest cover – occurred at the national scale, deforestation fronts and agricultural colonization for commodity crops – a. o. coffee – still dominated the Central Highlands plateaus. Previous studies suggested that the dominant land use changes in that region were {{on the one hand}} the acquisition and conversion of agricultural lands to perennial crops for external markets by capital-endowed Kinh households – the majority ethnic group in Vietnam – {{and on the other hand}} the corresponding displacement of poor households of ethnic minorities relying on shifting cultivation towards the forest margins. This study tested this hypothesis by using remote sensing to analyze land use and cover changes and deforestation trajectories in the coffee-growing area in Dak Lak and Dak Nong provinces over 2000 – 2010. Land use changes were linked with socioeconomic dynamics using secondary statistics and spatial modelling. Net deforestation reached − 0. 31 % y− 1 of the total area between 2000 and 2010. Deforestation was indeed mainly directly caused by shifting cultivation for annual crops, but this was partly driven indirectly by expansion of coffee and <b>other</b> <b>perennial</b> <b>crops</b> over agricultural lands. Displacement of shifting cultivation into the forest margins, pushed by market crops expansion, was the spatial manifestation of the marginalization of local ethnic minorities and poor migrants, pushed by capital-endowed migrants. This marginalization is a long-standing process rooted in the colonization and development strategy for the highlands followed since colonial times. Over the late 2000 s, rapid deforestation was strongly reducing the benefits of national-scale forest recovery, and might shift the country back to net losses of natural forest.
