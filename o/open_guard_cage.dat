40|$|Abstract. An open edge of {{a simple}} polygon is the set of points in the {{relative}} interior of an edge. We revisit several art gallery problems, previously considered for closed edge <b>guards,</b> using <b>open</b> edge <b>guards.</b> A guard {{edge of a}} polygon is an edge that sees every point inside the polygon. We show that every simple non-starshaped polygon admits at most one <b>open</b> <b>guard</b> edge, and give a simple new proof that it admits at most three closed guard edges. We also characterize <b>open</b> <b>guard</b> edges using a special type of kernel. Finally, we present lower bound constructions for simple polygons with n vertices that require ⌊n/ 3 ⌋ <b>open</b> edge <b>guards,</b> and conjecture that this bound is tight...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a {{variation}} of the Art Gallery problem that considers <b>open</b> edge <b>guards</b> and <b>open</b> mobile <b>guards.</b> A mobile guard can be placed on edges and diagonals of a polygon, and the "open" prefix means that the endpoints of such edge or diagonal are not taken into account for visibility purposes. This paper studies the number of guards that are sufficient and sometimes necessary to guard some classes of simple polygons for both open edge and <b>open</b> mobile <b>guards.</b> This problem is also considered for planar triangulation graphs using <b>open</b> edge <b>guards.</b> Comment: 13 page...|$|R
5000|$|In a Brazilian jiu-jitsu match, {{grappler}} 'C' {{is holding}} the other grappler 'D' in an <b>open</b> <b>guard.</b> The <b>open</b> <b>guard</b> allows grappler 'C' to attempt a multitude of submission holds, while grappler 'D's priority is to advance in position, grappler 'C' is in a dominant position with the top grappler is in an inferior position, as {{it is hard for}} 'D' to attack before they improve their position. 'D' then used a Near knee guard pass getting one leg though to gain Half guard, a more dominant position where they can attack 'C' and 'C' will find submitting them more difficult ...|$|R
50|$|Near Knee Guard Pass is also {{demonstrated}} in The Essence Of Judo by Mifune. The main characteristic of this pass is the practitioner driving their knee over the opponent's same side thigh {{while in the}} opponent's <b>open</b> <b>guard.</b>|$|R

50|$|In the <b>open</b> <b>guard,</b> {{the legs}} are not hooked {{together}} and the bottom grappler uses his legs or feet to push or pull in a more dynamic fashion. There are many variations of <b>open</b> <b>guard</b> with distinct names and positioning including the Butterfly Guard, De La Riva Guard, X-Guard, Spider Guard, Lapel Guard, and even the newly emerging Worm Guard made popular by Keenan Cornelius. Butterfly guard is when the bottom grappler brings his legs up and feet together against the inner thighs of top opponent. The name {{is derived from the}} resulting butterfly wing shape. Butterfly guard increases both space to maneuver and the ability counter the opponent with the shins or arches of the feet against the competitor's inner thighs.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as full guard. The closed guard is the typical guard position. The legs are hooked behind {{the back of the}} opponent, preventing them from standing up or moving away. The opponent needs to open the legs up to be able to improve positioning. The bottom combatant might transit between the <b>open</b> and closed <b>guard,</b> as the <b>open</b> <b>guard</b> allows for better movement, but also has a bigger risk of the opponent passing the guard.|$|R
5000|$|If a downed fighter was {{at least}} a meter away from the cage, on his back and able to avoid or defend against attacks, the referee would raise his arm and call [...] "open guard".

50|$|This {{rule was}} {{introduced}} at Cage Rage 13 and {{was designed to}} prevent a fighter from laying in an <b>open</b> <b>guard</b> where his opponent can only throw leg kicks or drop to initiate grappling. However, due to their ongoing desire to standardise rules across the UK and work with a potential MMA board of control, this rule was scrapped.|$|R
50|$|Stacking Guard Pass is also {{demonstrated}} in The Essence Of Judo by Mifune, {{and it is}} also an unnamed technique described in The Canon Of Judo.

40|$|We {{study the}} Art Gallery Problem for face guards in {{polyhedral}} environments. The {{problem can be}} infor-mally stated as: how many (not necessarily convex) windows should we place on the external walls of a dark building, in order to completely illuminate it? We consider both closed and <b>open</b> face <b>guards</b> (i. e., faces with or without their boundary), and we give some {{upper and lower bounds}} on the minimum number of faces required to guard a given polyhedron, in terms {{of the total number of}} its faces, f. In some notable cases, our bounds are tight: bf/ 6 c <b>open</b> face <b>guards</b> for orthogonal polyhedra, and bf/ 4 c <b>open</b> face <b>guards</b> for 4 -oriented polyhedra (i. e., polyhedra whose faces have only four different orientations). Then we show that it is NP-hard to approximate the minimum number of (closed or <b>open)</b> face <b>guards</b> within a factor of Ω(log f), even for polyhedra that are orthogonal and simply connected. Along the way we discuss some applications, arguing that face guards are not a reasonable model for guards patrolling on the surface of a polyhedron. ...|$|R
