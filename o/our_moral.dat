500|$|Goldman {{viewed the}} state as {{essentially}} and inevitably a tool of control and domination. As a result, Goldman believed that voting was useless at best and dangerous at worst. Voting, she wrote, provided an illusion of participation while masking the true structures of decision-making. Instead, Goldman advocated targeted resistance {{in the form of}} strikes, protests, and [...] "direct action against the invasive, meddlesome authority of <b>our</b> <b>moral</b> code". She maintained an anti-voting position even when many anarcho-syndicalists in 1930s Spain voted for the formation of a liberal republic. Goldman wrote that any power anarchists wielded as a voting bloc should instead be used to strike across the country. She disagreed with the movement for women's suffrage, which demanded the right of women to vote. In her essay [...] "Woman Suffrage", she ridicules the idea that women's involvement would infuse the democratic state with a more just orientation: [...] "As if women have not sold their votes, as if women politicians cannot be bought!" [...] She agreed with the suffragists' assertion that women are equal to men, but disagreed that their participation alone would make the state more just. [...] "To assume, therefore, that she would succeed in purifying something which is not susceptible of purification, is to credit her with supernatural powers." ...|$|E

50|$|For {{the most}} part, social {{cognitive}} theory {{remains the same}} for various cultures. Since the concepts of moral behavior did not vary much between cultures (as crimes like murder, theft, and unwarranted violence are illegal in virtually every society), {{there is not much}} room for people to have different views on what is morally right or wrong. The main reason that social cognitive theory applies to all nations is because it does not say what is moral and immoral; it simply states that we can acknowledge these two concepts. Our actions in real-life scenarios are based on whether we believe the action is moral and whether the reward for violating <b>our</b> <b>morals</b> is significant enough, and nothing else.|$|R

However, in practice, it is impossible for one to study all variables and approaches of a particular question and come to a conclusion without any external influence. This is the reason why the society has agreed upon an ‘invisible government’ to interpret on our behalf information and narrow the choice field to a more practical scale.|$|R

Tillich related these to three different historical eras: the early centuries of the Christian era; the Reformation; and the 20th century.
