60|$|The blinds {{were drawn}} before the big, lighted {{window of the}} diningroom. Looking up the path at the side {{he could see the}} door left <b>open,</b> <b>shedding</b> a soft, {{coloured}} light from the hall lamp. He went quickly and silently up the path, and looked up into the hall. There were pictures on the walls, and the antlers of a stag--and the stairs going up on one side--and just near {{the foot of the stairs}} the half opened door of the dining-room.|$|E
40|$|Exoerythrocytic (EE) {{stages of}} Plasmodium berghei derived from {{irradiated}} sporozoites were cultured in vitro in HepG 2 cells. They synthesized several antigens, predominantly but not exclusively those expressed by normal early erythrocytic schizonts. After invasion, {{over half the}} intracellular sporozoites, both normal and irradiated, appeared to die. After 24 h, {{in marked contrast to}} the normal parasites, EE parasites derived from irradiated sporozoites continued to break <b>open,</b> <b>shedding</b> their antigens into the cytoplasm of the infected host cells. Increasing radiation dosage, which has previously been shown to reduce the ability of irradiated sporozoites to protect animals, correlated with reduced de novo antigen synthesis by EE parasites derived from irradiated sporozoites...|$|E

40|$|Holstein Friesian and Brown Swiss cows {{were kept}} in {{different}} ventilation conditions. Respiration, pulse rates of animals and daily milk yield, some milk components were investigated in optimal, unventilated and <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> barns. In unventilated barn physiological traits of cows were affected considerably. Barn II had delayed effect on daily milk yield and milk fat of cows after they were transferred to <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> barn. Also, lower temperature in barn III had negative impact on daily milk yield. Milk dry matter and pH were not influenced by barn ventilation. It {{is thought to be}} the primer step to attach importance to the barn ventilation, especially in cold climates...|$|R
6000|$|Under the <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> {{he found}} Mrs. Blake lying on some hay which evidently {{she had just}} pulled down from the loft. When she saw Pan her pale convulsed face changed somehow. [...] "Oh--thank God!" [...] she cried.|$|R
50|$|The Silverhill pottery {{opened in}} 1838 and {{provided}} {{an important source}} of employment for local people. It consisted of a large <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> with a tiled roof and a round kiln where roof tiles and chimney pots were made.|$|R
60|$|Not a {{spark of}} hope {{remained}} to Lightfoot. He simply stood still and trembled, partly with fear and partly with weariness. Then a surprising thing happened. The man spoke softly. He advanced, not threateningly but slowly, and in a friendly way. He walked around back of Lightfoot and then straight towards him. Lightfoot walked on a few steps, and the man followed, still talking softly. Little by little he urged Lightfoot on, driving him towards an <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> in which was a pile of hay. Without understanding just how, Lightfoot {{knew that he had}} found a friend. So he entered the <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> and with a long sigh lay down in the soft hay.|$|R
50|$|Pictures of {{the cotton}} press at its {{original}} location show a rectangular <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> with a steep hip roof. The top of the press extends through this roof. It is covered by a smaller, rectangular hip roof that rotates with the screw.|$|R
60|$|Our {{story will}} not yet see daylight. A {{few days after}} Christmas, Aaron sat in the <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> {{at the bottom of}} his own garden, looking out on the rainy darkness. No one knew he was there. It was some time after six in the evening.|$|R
50|$|On {{the north}} (front) facade the second bay {{from the west}} is a gabled stone projection. An <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> roof on the first story shelters the main entrance.

60|$|He {{had set up}} his caravan and lighted his {{candles on}} {{another part of the}} girls' croquet-green, under one of those <b>open</b> <b>sheds</b> which are so common in France to shelter markets; and he and his wife, by the time we strolled up there, were trying to keep order with the audience.|$|R
50|$|Callan is a town, {{served by}} a station. The station has a {{platform}} {{on either side of}} three tracks - two of those tracks pass under a bridge, while the third leads to a single shed. Behind one of the platforms is an adjacent shunting yard, which at one point featured an <b>open</b> <b>shed.</b>|$|R
60|$|Of the outlaws present Euchre {{appeared}} to be the one most inclined to lend friendliness to curiosity; and he led Duane and the horses away to a small adobe shack. He tied the horses in an <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> and removed their saddles. Then, gathering up Stevens's weapons, he invited his visitor to enter the house.|$|R
6000|$|So all {{afternoon}} Lightfoot rested {{and did not}} so much as put his nose outside that <b>open</b> <b>shed.</b> That is why the hunter got no glimpse of him. When it became dark, so dark that he knew there was no longer danger, Lightfoot got up and stepped out under the stars. He was feeling quite himself again. His splendid strength had returned. He bounded lightly across the meadow and up into the brushy pasture where the hunter had been hidden. There and in the woods back of the pasture he browsed, but at the first hint of the coming of another day, Lightfoot turned back, and when his friend, the farmer, came out early in the morning to milk the cows, there was Lightfoot back in the <b>open</b> <b>shed.</b> The farmer smiled. [...] "You are as wise as you are handsome, old fellow," [...] said he.|$|R
50|$|A dairy complex survives at {{the eastern}} end of this built up area and this {{comprises}} a number of interconnected <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> with corrugated iron roofs supported on timber posts. Holding yards abutting the dairy also survive. Sections of the cattle dip and several other outbuildings along with extensive early fencing and shelters survive on this southern side of the approach road.|$|R
50|$|The <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> {{dates from}} the eighteenth century. It was {{originally}} built at Charlwood, Surrey. It served as a cart shed and also a saw shed. The shed was dismantled in 1999, the work being partly funded by the British Airports Authority. When it was reconstructed at the Museum in 2000, the horse whim from West Kingsdown, Kent, was installed.|$|R
6000|$|The {{train from}} 'Frisco was very late. It should {{have arrived at}} Hugson's Siding at midnight, but it was already five o'clock and the gray dawn was {{breaking}} in the east when the little train slowly rumbled up to the <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> that served for the station-house. As {{it came to a}} stop the conductor called out in a loud voice: ...|$|R

60|$|A little {{above the}} {{northern}} {{foot of the}} Abo Yáo the native workmen are employed in making a large platform, or terrace, for stamps and other machinery; now it is about 150 × 40 yards. As {{yet there is no}} power. A large <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> of timber-posts, with a roofing of corrugated iron, stands ready to receive the expected saw-mill. The only actual industry is digging.|$|R
50|$|A large <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> {{comprising}} {{an expansive}} hipped corrugated iron roof supported on timber posts forms {{part of the}} early draft stables. This building houses an early carriage, apparently acquired by the McConnels from the Queensland Government when a present was made to the Government of some red deer which were freed near Cressbrook. On the northern side of the stables is a large recess, where the roof is cut out.|$|R
50|$|The Pinky Pruitt Barn is a {{historic}} barn {{on the south side}} of Arkansas Highway 14, just west of St. James, Arkansas. It is a single-crib structure 1-1/2 stories in height, built out of rough-hewn logs, with a stone pier foundation. It is surrounded on three sides by <b>open</b> <b>sheds</b> supported by log posts. It was built about 1890, and is reflective of the earliest form of barn built in Stone County by arriving settlers.|$|R
50|$|In the 1920s <b>open</b> <b>sheds</b> {{were built}} as cover from the weather for sellers and buyers. The Haymarket started to {{decline in the}} 1940s {{with the rise of}} chain groceries. Many vendors left for a suburban, rail-connected market in 1962. A few vendors {{attempted}} to hang on at the original site, but a ramp to Interstate 65 was built through the site and Haymarket closed after 71 years on September 1, 1962.|$|R
5000|$|Bernard's Airport and Watts Airport {{were still}} in {{operation}} concurrently in 1935, but Watts Airport closed not long afterwards, leading to considerable expansion at the Bernard airfield. The Oregonian of September 11, 1938, stated that Bernard Airport was [...] "perhaps the busiest non-commercial airport in the United States". [...] By 1955, it had 44 wooden hangars, along with numerous <b>open</b> <b>sheds</b> (or [...] "'plane-ports") capable of housing more than 100 additional light aircraft.|$|R
60|$|Victoria drew up {{in front}} of an {{unpainted}} farm-house straggling beside the road, a farm-house which began with the dignity of fluted pilasters and ended in a tumble-down <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> filled with a rusty sleigh and a hundred nondescript articles--some of which seemed to be moving. Intently studying this phenomenon from her runabout, she finally discovered that the moving objects were children; one of whom, a little girl, came out and stared at her.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{must prepare}} for it," [...] said Anne tranquilly. A {{thunderstorm}} seemed a trifle {{in comparison with}} what had already happened. [...] "You'd better drive the horse and buggy into that <b>open</b> <b>shed.</b> Fortunately my parasol is in the buggy. Here [...] . take my hat with you. Marilla told me I was a goose to put on my best hat {{to come to the}} Tory Road and she was right, as she always is." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{reason that}} the hunter had been so {{disappointed}} was that Lightfoot was smart. He {{was smart enough to}} understand that the man who was saving him from the hunter had done it because he was a true friend. All the afternoon Lightfoot had rested on a bed of soft hay in an <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> and had watched this man going about his work and taking the utmost care to do nothing to frighten Lightfoot.|$|R

50|$|Father O'Kane died in April 1852. The first high mass of {{the church}} was sung at his funeral, and he was laid {{to rest in the}} {{cemetery}} behind the church. He was succeeded by the Rev. F. X. Villanis, who remained until the autumn of 1856. Under Father Villanis the pastoral house was built. It was a rough-cast house with a gable end and a slanted roof facing Church Street. The only back building was an <b>open</b> <b>shed.</b> The residence cost $3,800.|$|R

50|$|The tunoa (cook house) is {{a flimsy}} structure, small in size, {{and not really}} to be {{considered}} as a house. In modern times, the cook house, called the umukuka, is {{at the rear of the}} family compound, where all the cooking is carried out in an earth oven, umu, and pots over the fire. In most villages, the umukuka is really a simple <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> made with a few posts with an iron roof to protect the cooking area from the weather.|$|R
60|$|The {{people had}} already begun to dance in an <b>open</b> <b>shed</b> {{fronting}} upon the shore. There were fires of pine knots in front of the building, lighting up the interior with a red glare. A negro was playing a fiddle somewhere inside, and the shed was filled with a crowd of grotesque dancing figures--men and women. Now and then they called with loud voices as they danced, and the squeaking of the fiddle sounded incessantly through the noise of outcries and the stamp and shuffling of feet.|$|R
50|$|The bridge {{construction}} was undertaken by Evans Deakin, who converted the immigration depot's grounds into an industrial site with workshops and storehouses. A row of three <b>open</b> <b>sheds</b> {{cut off the}} connection between the hostel and the river, remaining in place until some time after the works were completed. The bridge is carried on tall stone pylons across the site {{to the rear of the}} principal building. The danger from falling debris and intentionally thrown objects has resulted in the need to identify an easement across the property on which no buildings can be constructed.|$|R
