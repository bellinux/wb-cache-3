5|$|Based on Apollo 17 observations, {{the valley}} floor is {{generally}} a gently rolling plane. Boulders of various sizes and other geologic deposits are scattered throughout the valley. At the ALSEP lunar experiment deployment area, located west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> landing site, the boulders average about four meters in size and are higher in concentration than {{in other areas of}} the valley.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{increasing}} trend of decreased fertility rate, {{there has been an}} increased nuclearization of the family, where families have less immediate relatives to depend on in times of need. Because of this phenomenon, families do not have an extended family to depend on when they need a caretaker or someone to do domestic work, and must turn to market substitutes or a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> family doing both domestic and paid work instead.|$|E

5|$|In August 1928, Godley was {{appointed}} to the governorship of Gibraltar, a position in which he remained until his retirement in 1933. Godley was considered the ablest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> post war governors although he made a misjudgement in interfering in the politics of the Royal Calpe Hunt. The King had to intercede after Godley removed the master of the hunt creating large divisions that were not repaired until his successor took charge.|$|E

5|$|Rocks sampled in the {{immediate}} vicinity of the Lunar Module are mostly vesicular coarse-grained subfloor basalt, with some appearance of fine-grained basalt as well. Much of the valley floor, as displayed in observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> landing area, is predominately regolith and fragments varying in sizes excavated by several impacts in the Moon's history.|$|E
5|$|A {{hyperbaric}} lifeboat or hyperbaric {{rescue unit}} may {{be provided for}} emergency evacuation of saturation divers from a saturation system. This would be used if the platform is at immediate risk due to fire or sinking, and allows the divers under saturation to get clear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> danger. A hyperbaric lifeboat may be self-propelled and can be operated by crew while the while the occupants are under pressure. It must be self-sufficient for several days at sea, {{in case of a}} delay in rescue due to sea conditions. The crew would normally start decompression as soon as possible after launching.|$|E
5|$|After landing, Young and Duke began {{powering}} {{down some of}} the LM's systems to conserve battery power. Upon completing their initial adjustments, the pair configured Orion for their three-day stay on the lunar surface, removed their space suits and took initial geological observations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> landing site. They then settled down for their first meal on the surface. After eating, they configured the cabin for their first sleep period on the Moon. The landing delay caused by the malfunction in the Command/Service Module's main engine necessitated significant modifications to the mission schedule. Apollo 16 would spend one less day in lunar orbit after surface exploration had been completed to afford the crew contingency time to compensate for any further problems and to conserve expendables. In order to improve Young's and Duke's sleep schedule, the third and final moonwalk of the mission was trimmed from seven hours to five.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{reliable}} documentation of the demographic impact of the Black Death in Scotland, there are some indications <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> effects of the plague. Walter Bower recorded that 24, about a third, of the canons of St. Andrews died during the outbreak. There are also anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades. If the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Compared with the distribution of population after the later Clearances and the Industrial Revolution, these numbers would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the River Tay.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player has to take off the runway at an Allied base. Afterwards they can fly around and look for enemies to engage. The player can open their Satellite Intelligence Map, which shows a live map <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> {{coastline}} with items of interest, such as, friendly bases, enemy positions, and refuelling locations. The player can perform various flight manoeuvres and stunts mid-air, such are loops, rolls, or dummy stalls. Flying, especially at high altitudes, spends the plane's fuel and the player must either return to their base or perform an aerial refueling. To refuel mid-air, the player has to rendezvous with a refuelling plane at the specified coordinates and perform a boom and receptacle refuelling manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|However, {{during the}} 1980s, two Sun-observing {{satellites}} serendipitously discovered several {{new members of}} the Kreutz family, and since {{the launch of the}} SOHO Sun-observing satellite in 1995, it has been possible to observe comets very close to the Sun at any time of year. The satellite provides a constant view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> solar vicinity, and SOHO has now discovered hundreds of new Sun-grazing comets, some just a few metres across. About 83% of the sungrazers found by SOHO are members of the Kreutz group, with the other being referred to as 'non-Kreutz' or 'sporadic' sungrazers (Meyer, Marsden, and Kracht1&2 families). On average, a new member of the Kreutz family is discovered every three days. Apart from Comet Lovejoy, none of the sungrazers seen by SOHO has survived its perihelion passage; some may have plunged into the Sun itself, but most are likely to have simply evaporated away completely.|$|E

5|$|Rescue efforts began {{immediately}} after the crash. Almost all the successful rescues of survivors occurred within {{half an hour of}} the impact. Initially, rescue efforts were led by the military and civilian employees within the building. Within minutes, the first fire companies arrived and found these volunteers searching near the impact site. The firemen ordered them to leave as they were not properly equipped or trained to deal with the hazards. The Arlington County Fire Department (ACFD) assumed command <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> rescue operation within 10minutes of the crash. ACFD Assistant Chief James Schwartz implemented an incident command system (ICS) to coordinate response efforts among multiple agencies. It took about an hour for the ICS structure to become fully operational. Firefighters from Fort Myer and Reagan National Airport arrived within minutes. Rescue and firefighting efforts were impeded by rumors of additional incoming planes. Chief Schwartz ordered two evacuations during the day in response to these rumors.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{reacts with}} moisture {{on the skin}} and in the eyes, causing a burning sensation and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of the eyes. Effects usually include tears streaming from the eyes, profuse coughing, exceptional nasal discharge that is full of mucus, burning in the eyes, eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where sweaty and/or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Almost all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> effects wear off within an hour (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although the feeling of burning and highly irritated skin may persist for hours. Affected clothing {{will need to be}} washed several times or thrown away.|$|E
5|$|Though {{most of the}} Jews {{still alive}} in Linz after the war had emigrated, Wiesenthal decided to stay on, partly because the family of Adolf Eichmann lived {{a few blocks away}} from him. Eichmann had been in charge of the {{transportation}} and deportation of Jews in the Nazi Final Solution to the Jewish Question: a plan, finalised at the Wannsee Conference—at which Eichmann took the minutes—to exterminate all the Jews in Europe. After the war, Eichmann hid in Austria using forged identity papers until 1950, when he left via Italy and moved to Argentina under an assumed name. Hoping to obtain information on Eichmann's whereabouts, Wiesenthal continuously monitored the remaining members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immediate</b> family in Linz until they vanished in 1952.|$|E
