5|$|After an aborted {{attempt by}} Kennedy to bring yet another studio that {{had turned to}} him for help, First National Pictures, into the Photophone fold, RCA was ready to step back in: the company {{acquired}} Kennedy's stock in both FBO and the KAO theater business. On October 23, 1928, RCA announced {{the creation of the}} Radio-Keith-Orpheum holding company, with Sarnoff as chairman of the board. Kennedy, who withdrew from his executive positions in the merged companies, kept Pathé separate from RKO and under his personal control. RCA owned the governing stock interest in RKO, 22 percent; in the early 1930s, RCA's share <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> the company rose as high as 60 percent. The company's production and distribution arm, presided over by former FBO vice-president Joseph I. Schnitzer, was incorporated early in 1929 as Radio Pictures. Looking {{to get out of the}} film business the following year, Kennedy arranged in late 1930 for RKO to purchase Pathé from him.|$|E
5|$|It {{quickly became}} evident that, {{contrary}} to some rumors, Norton {{had died in}} complete poverty. Five or six dollars in small change had been found on his person, and a search of his room at the boarding house on Commercial Street turned up a single gold sovereign, then worth around $2.50; his collection of walking sticks; his rather battered saber; a variety of headgear (including a stovepipe, a derby, a red-laced Army cap, and another cap suited to a martial band-master); an 1828 French franc; {{and a handful of}} the Imperial bonds he sold to tourists at a fictitious 7% interest. There were fake telegrams purporting to be from Emperor Alexander II of Russia, congratulating Norton on his forthcoming marriage to Queen Victoria, and from the President of France, predicting that such a union would be disastrous to world peace. Also found were his letters to Queen Victoria and 98 shares <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> <b>in</b> a defunct gold mine.|$|E

40|$|The {{value of}} {{specialist}} {{assistance to the}} trading <b>of</b> low-volume <b>stocks</b> has important implications in exchange design.

These results are consistent with specialist subsidization <b>of</b> low-volume <b>stocks</b> <b>in</b> their portfolios and suggest that specialists provide important support to the trading <b>of</b> inactive <b>stocks</b> if they have the resources.
