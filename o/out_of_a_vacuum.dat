And this holds true, though the Number of the refracting Substances be increased to Infinity, and the Distances from one another as much decreased, so that the Light may be refracted in every Point of its Passage, and by continual Refractions bent into a Curve-Line. And therefore the whole Refraction of Light in passing through the Atmosphere from the highest and rarest Part thereof down to the lowest and densest Part, must be equal to the Refraction which it would suffer in passing at like Obliquity <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>Vacuum</b> immediately into Air of equal Density with that in the lowest Part of the Atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|Pressure {{experiments}} are experiments performed at pressures lower or higher than atmospheric pressure, called low-pressure experiments and high-pressure experiments, respectively. Pressure experiment are necessary because substances behave differently at different pressures. For example, water boils {{at a lower}} temperature at lower pressures. The equipment used for pressure experiments depends on whether the pressure is to be increased or decreased and by how much. A vacuum pump is used to remove the air <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> vessel for low-pressure experiments. High-pressures can be created with a piston-cylinder apparatus, up to 5 GPa (50 000 bar) and ~2000 °C. The piston is shifted with hydraulics, decreasing the volume inside the confining cylinder and increasing the pressure. For higher pressures, up to 25 GPa, a multi-anvil cell is used and for even higher pressures the diamond anvil cell. The diamond anvil cell is used to create extremely high pressures, {{as much as a}} million atmospheres (101 GPa), though only over a small area. The current record is 560 GPa, but the sample size is confined to the order of tens of micrometres (10−5 m).|$|E
5000|$|Two {{papers were}} {{published}} in 1948 discussing the [...] "Steady State theory" [...] {{as an alternative to}} the Big Bang: one by Gold and Bondi, the other by Hoyle. In their seminal paper, Gold and Bondi asserted that although the universe is expanding, it nevertheless does not change its look over time; it has no beginning and no end. They proposed the perfect cosmological principle as the underpinning of their theory, which held that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic in space and time. On the large scale, they argued that there [...] "is nothing outstanding about any place in the universe, and that those differences which do exist are only of local significance; that seen on a large scale the universe is homogeneous." [...] However, since the universe was not characterized by a lack of evolution, distinguishing features or recognizable direction of time, they postulated that there had to be large-scale motions in the universe. They highlighted two possible types of motion: large-scale expansion and its reverse, large-scale contraction. They estimated that within the expanding universe, hydrogen atoms were being created <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> at a rate of one atom per cubic meter per 109 years. This creation of matter would keep the density of the universe constant as it expanded. Gold and Bondi also stated that the issues with time scale that had plagued other cosmological theories - such as the discrepancy between the age of the universe as calculated by Hubble and dating of radioactive decay in terrestrial rocks - were absent for the Steady State theory.|$|E

Fynn also sometimes served as an agent of the colonial authorities on certain deniable [...] "dirty work" [...] missions, such as instigating hostilities between various tribes. Wylie asserts that far from being a genocidal maniac, Shaka often ruled as a traditional Bantu monarch of his era. He attacked some enemies, but he also left numerous tribes in place, and maintained a network of dependent states in peaceful tributary relations, or as allied client states. The massive killing sprees alleged are distorted—Shaka was not the only operator in the area. There were other tribes and leaders of the era, each on the move with their own conflicts, that created turmoil, not merely Shaka. Others included the Ndwandwe, and the Mabhudu who built a polity that outlasted Shaka's and were: [...] "partly responsible for pushing the Diamini-Swazi Tlokwa and Ngwane groups west across the Lubombo hills on to the highveld... the Ndwandwe would become easily the most aggressive of all groups, certainly surpassing the Zulu." [...] Wylie also notes that the Zulu themselves were born in circumstances of threat even before Shaka was born as the Mthethwa, protectors of the small Zulu clan, jockeyed against regional rivals like the Ndwandwe, the Chunu and the Thembu.

40|$|One of the {{problems}} in the high-power lasers design is in outcoupling of a powerful laser beam <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> volume into atmosphere. Usually the laser device is located inside a vacuum tank. The laser radiation is transported to the outside world through the transparent vacuum window. While considered transparent, some of the light passing through the glass is absorbed and converted to heat. For most applications, these properties are academic curiosities; however, in multi-kilowatt lasers, the heat becomes significant and can lead to a failure. The absorbed power can result in thermal stress, reduction of light transmission and, consequently, window damage. Modern optical technology has developed different types of glass (Silica, BK 7, diamond, etc.) that have high thermal conductivity and damage threshold. However, for kilo- and megawatt lasers the issue still remains open. In this paper we present a solution that may relieve the heat load on the output window. We discuss advantages and issues of this particular window design...|$|E

40|$|Renormalization group {{procedure}} for effective particles {{is applied to}} the model quantum theory of free fermions to which one adds an interaction in the form <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mass mixing term. If one used a standard approach based on the instant form of dynamics, the theory would suffer from <b>a</b> generic <b>vacuum</b> problem caused by <b>a</b> divergent production <b>of</b> virtual quanta <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bare <b>vacuum</b> and it would require <b>an</b> adjustment <b>of</b> its degrees of freedom to the added interaction term before quantization, considered <b>a</b> means <b>of</b> avoiding the quantum vacuum problem. In the effective particle approach, the quantum vacuum problem is dealt with instead by using the front form of dynamics, where the pair production is excluded by momentum conservation. The corresponding Hamiltonian includes mass parameters through constraint equations while the required quantum field operators are constructed independently of all mass parameters, including the parameters that appear in the added mass mixing interaction term.

60|$|Qu. 29. Are not the Rays of Light {{very small}} Bodies emitted from shining Substances? For such Bodies will pass through uniform Mediums in right Lines without bending into the Shadow, {{which is the}} Nature of the Rays of Light. They will also be capable of several Properties, {{and be able to}} {{conserve}} their Properties unchanged in passing through several Mediums, which is another Condition of the Rays of Light. Pellucid Substances act upon the Rays <b>of</b> Light at <b>a</b> distance in refracting, reflecting, and inflecting them, and the Rays mutually agitate the Parts of those Substances at a distance for heating them; and this Action and Re-action at a distance very much resembles an attractive Force between Bodies. If Refraction be perform'd by Attraction of the Rays, the Sines of Incidence must be to the Sines <b>of</b> Refraction in <b>a</b> given Proportion, as we shew'd in our Principles of Philosophy: And this Rule is true by Experience. The Rays of Light in going <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Glass into <b>a</b> <b>Vacuum,</b> are bent towards the Glass; and if they fall too obliquely on the Vacuum, they are bent backwards into the Glass, and totally reflected; and this Reflexion cannot be ascribed to the Resistance <b>of</b> <b>an</b> absolute <b>Vacuum,</b> but must be caused by the Power of the Glass attracting the Rays at their going <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it into the Vacuum, and bringing them back. For if the farther Surface of the Glass be moisten'd with Water or clear Oil, or liquid and clear Honey, the Rays which would otherwise be reflected will go into the Water, Oil, or Honey; and therefore are not reflected before they arrive at the farther Surface of the Glass, and begin to go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. If they go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it into the Water, Oil, or Honey, they go on, because the Attraction of the Glass is almost balanced and rendered ineffectual by the contrary Attraction of the Liquor. But if they go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it into <b>a</b> <b>Vacuum</b> which has no Attraction to balance that of the Glass, the Attraction of the Glass either bends and refracts them, or brings them back and reflects them. And this is still more evident by laying together two Prisms of Glass, or two Object-glasses of very long Telescopes, the one plane, the other a little convex, and so compressing them that they do not fully touch, nor are too far asunder. For the Light which falls upon the farther Surface of the first Glass where the Interval between the Glasses is not above the ten hundred thousandth Part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Inch, will go through that Surface, and through the Air or Vacuum between the Glasses, and enter into the second Glass, as was explain'd in the first, fourth, and eighth Observations of the first Part of the second Book. But, if the second Glass be taken away, the Light which goes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the second Surface of the first Glass into the Air or Vacuum, will not go on forwards, but turns back into the first Glass, and is reflected; and therefore it is drawn back by the Power of the first Glass, there being nothing else to turn it back. Nothing more is requisite for producing all the variety of Colours, and degrees of Refrangibility, than that the Rays of Light be Bodies of different Sizes, the least of which may take violet the weakest and darkest of the Colours, and be more easily diverted by refracting Surfaces from the right Course; and the rest as they are bigger and bigger, may make the stronger and more lucid Colours, blue, green, yellow, and red, and be more and more difficultly diverted. Nothing more is requisite for putting the Rays of Light into Fits of easy Reflexion and easy Transmission, than that they be small Bodies which by their attractive Powers, or some other Force, stir up Vibrations in what they act upon, which Vibrations being swifter than the Rays, overtake them successively, and agitate them so as by turns to increase and decrease their Velocities, and thereby put them into those Fits. And lastly, the unusual Refraction of Island-Crystal looks very much as if it were perform'd by some kind of attractive virtue lodged in certain Sides both of the Rays, and of the Particles of the Crystal. For were it not for some kind of Disposition or Virtue lodged in some Sides of the Particles of the Crystal, and not in their other Sides, and which inclines and bends the Rays towards the Coast of unusual Refraction, the Rays which fall perpendicularly on the Crystal, would not be refracted towards that Coast rather than towards any other Coast, both at their Incidence and at their Emergence, so as to emerge perpendicularly by <b>a</b> contrary Situation <b>of</b> the Coast of unusual Refraction at the second Surface; the Crystal acting upon the Rays after they have pass'd through it, and are emerging into the Air; or, if you please, into <b>a</b> <b>Vacuum.</b> And since the Crystal by this Disposition or Virtue does not act upon the Rays, unless when one of their Sides of unusual Refraction looks towards that Coast, this argues a Virtue or Disposition in those Sides of the Rays, which answers to, and sympathizes with that Virtue or Disposition of the Crystal, as the Poles of two Magnets answer to one another. And as Magnetism may be intended and remitted, and is found only in the Magnet and in Iron: So this Virtue of refracting the perpendicular Rays is greater in Island-Crystal, less in Crystal of the Rock, and is not yet found in other Bodies. I do not say that this Virtue is magnetical: It seems to be of another kind. I only say, that whatever it be, it's difficult to conceive how the Rays of Light, unless they be Bodies, can have a permanent Virtue in two of their Sides which is not in their other Sides, and this without any regard to their Position to the Space or Medium through which they pass.|$|R

Therefore, the sociology of knowledge will analyze process of the formation of the Islamic Left as a social reality, and how the Islamic Left can be seen and accepted by society. In an objective reality, the Islamic Left is a discourse of thought of a particular experience with the aim of revolution. While in a subjective reality, the Islamic Left can be considered as an individual who was born at a time when human values are at stake in the history of life, either in a global context or in a context of Islam itself. Thus, it builds awareness that distinguishes him/herself psychologically with others. This study expects the ideas contained in the Islamic Left to be used widely to analyze different contexts so that the application of the Islamic Left ideas can be viewed...|$|E
40|$|Bulk funding as an {{education}} policy was immensely controversial, and served to polarise the New Zealand educational {{community and the}} wider New Zealand public throughout the eight years of its operation between 1992 and 2000. Even now, fifteen years after its demise, the research undertaken for this thesis shows that bulk funding still {{has the power to}} divide people and to excite strong passions. Both the supporters and the opponents of bulk funding tended to demonise the opposite side. Each side would also tend to feel that they had uncovered profound educational truths and that they had the right arguments on their side. Therefore, each side tended to believe that their opponents could negate their arguments only by resorting to ‘slanderous’ speech and to ‘libelous’ writings. Some of the key participants in the bulk funding debate were able {{to be interviewed for this}} thesis. It quickly became apparent just how wide the gap between the two parties was during the 1990 s and is still today. The research undertaken for this study has discovered that there are often tensions between the central education authorities who devise and impose policy and the local authorities who have to implement it. Bulk funding would seem to be a classic example of the perennial tensions between the centre and the localities. These tensions are a thread that runs throughout the course of New Zealand educational history. Bulk funding did not emerge <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> Therefore, it was decided to adopt a “forward moving” historical narrative approach instead of a “history of the present. ” My research showed that there have been precursors to this policy right from the time of the first mission schools in the Bay of Islands from 1815 onwards. This study found that these distant historical forebears had to be investigated in order to make more sense of what occurred in the 1990 s. Finally, being at a distance from New Zealand and working as a secondary school teacher in Hong Kong where teachers are generally well respected as Chan (2008) noted, it was interesting for me as a ‘distant researcher’ to look back to New Zealand and to the case of bulk funding...|$|E
40|$|The most {{conspicuous}} of {{recent developments in}} ethics {{is the emergence of}} that has been variously called by its foes: non-propositlonal ethics: and by its friends metaethics. The former term stresses its conclusions: the latter its method. Neither the method nor the conclusions are altogether new; but I think {{it is safe to say}} they are different enough from those of traditional ethical theory to make it dangerous to apply most of the traditional labels. What may seem a "subjectivist" conclusion may stress aspects unlike those important to traditional subjectivism; what may seem an "objectivist" conclusion does not necessarily imply the independent subsistence of moral fact, Thus when us shall: in this thesis: hold that an "objective" or "descriptive" analysis is more appropriate to ethical language than the "subjective" analyses offered by the theories we will consider, we do not at the same time claim to be taking a diametrically opposed stand. Indeed: what we will suggest is no more than a small but important shift of analytic emphasis; and it depends entirely on the acceptance of the bulk of metaethical findings. Two words of warning. First: we have restricted ourselves primarily to that part of ethical language called "evaluative", and characterised by the word "good" more plainly then by "ought", "right" or "duty". It may be that these latter concepts must bear a different logical Interpretation; but if so I do not think those differences would be so great as to require an entirely dissimilar sort of analysis. Our holding; in the main, to evaluation is more a matter of attempting to gain in depth what we might lose in breadth in the space available to us; though I think the conclusions we will reach apply equally to all ethical language. Secondly; we must note that this now metaethics has not come <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> It Is simply one part of a larger view of philosophic method end purpose; and at least some of what we will say must be seen y not only as commenting on ethics, but as commenting on the applications of this method. As our title might hint; many of the views we will gut forward are suggested by the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgernstein; both those of the authors we will treat' and our sun. The debt must remain implicit, for Wittgenstein had almost nothing to say about ethics. It is nonetheless, enormous. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E
