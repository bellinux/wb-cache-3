5|$|US {{intelligence}} officers believe {{the most likely}} explanation was that someone in the cockpit of Flight 370 re-programmed the aircraft's autopilot before it travelled south across the Indian Ocean. Police searched the homes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> and seized financial records for all 12 crew members, including bank statements, credit card bills and mortgage documents. On 2 April 2014, Malaysia's Police Inspector-General said that more than 170 interviews had been conducted as part of Malaysia's criminal investigation, including interviews with family members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> and crew.|$|E
5|$|As was {{standard}} practice, Colvill {{was subsequently}} tried by court martial aboard Africaine on 31 December {{for the loss}} of his ship. The court acquitted him, his officers and his men of all blame. The court found the cause of the accident to be the thick fog and the ignorance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots.</b> The court required the pilots to forfeit their pay, barred them from piloting any of His Majesty's ships, and imprisoned them for a time in the Marshalsea.|$|E
5|$|Galland himself flew on {{unauthorised}} interception {{flights to}} experience the combat pressures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots,</b> and witnessed USAAF bombers being escorted by large numbers of P-51 Mustangs. Nevertheless, on occasions the Sturmbock tactics worked. For example, on 7 July 1944 Eighth Air Force bombers belonging to the 492nd Bomb Group were intercepted unescorted. The entire squadron of 12 B-24s were shot down. The USAAF 2nd Air Division lost 28 Liberators that day, the majority to a Sturmbock attack.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} <b>the</b> integration <b>of</b> detailed {{models of}} a pilot controlling a helicopter along the heave axis through the collective control inceptor. The {{action on the}} control inceptor is produced through a biomechanical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot’s</b> limbs, by commanding <b>the</b> activation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> related muscle bundles. Such activation, in turn, is determined by defining the muscle elongations required to move the control inceptor {{in order to obtain}} <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vehicle according to a high-level model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> voluntary action <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> acting as a regulator for the vehicle. <b>The</b> biomechanical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot’s</b> limbs and <b>the</b> aeromechanical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> helicopter are implemented in a general-purpose multibody simulation. The helicopter model, <b>the</b> biomechanical model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot’s</b> limbs, <b>the</b> cognitive model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot,</b> and their integration are discussed. The integrated model is applied to <b>the</b> simulation <b>of</b> simple, yet representative, mission task elements...|$|R

5|$|Unlike Hans-Joachim Marseille, {{who was a}} {{marksman}} {{and expert}} {{in the art of}} deflection shooting, Hartmann was a master of stalk-and-ambush tactics.

5|$|Well you can't believe it, but the Sturmovik, {{which was}} their main ground-attack aircraft, flew like B-17s in {{formation}} and didn't {{attempt to make}} any evasive manoeuvres. And all they had was one peashooter {{in the back of}} each plane. Also, some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> were women. Their peashooter was no threat unless they had a very lucky hit on you. I didn't open fire til the aircraft filled my whole windscreen. If I did this, I would get one every time.|$|E
5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia owe a deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham was {{promoted}} to acting squadron leader in September 1940, commanding B Flight. Within the month the unit received the heavily armed and powerful Bristol Beaufighter. After the commanding officer, Cunningham was the second man to fly it. The Beaufighter went through a teething stage in relation to its gun sight. The sight projected a ring of light with a spot at the centre onto a small sheet of glass directly in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> head. The spot in the centre provided the aiming point, and the ring, of variable diameter, helped him to judge the rage and amount of deflection needed to attack a target. The light's brilliance was adjustable by rheostat, but the control was ineffective. Rotating it a fraction could produce maximum brilliance or cause the spot to flicker out.|$|E

5|$|During the battle, the RAF had {{suffered}} a serious loss of experienced pilots. In mid-September, Fighter Command could call upon 1,492 operational pilots against an establishment of 1,662 – a deficiency of 10%. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> were ineffective unless led into battle by experienced men. Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding's policy was to move in fresh squadrons from quieter areas to replace losses in the units in the south-east as they became exhausted. By early September, the system was breaking down as squadrons were becoming depleted before fresh units could be formed and take their place.|$|E
5|$|On 6 March 1944, Jimmy Doolittle ordered 730 bombers to bomb Berlin for {{the first}} time. They were escorted by 644 fighters from 8th Air Force, 9th Air Force and the RAF. The Commander of I. Jagdkorps {{requested}} and received reinforcements from II. Jagdkorps and 7 Jagd-Division. Oesau led Stab./JG 1 and I./JG 1, Major Bär led II./JG 1, and accompanied by I./JG 11 and III./JG 54 they initially intercepted sixteen B-17s of 100th Bomb Group who were escorted by P-47s of the 78th Group. Ten B-17s {{went down in the}} first wave, and in several waves of attacks on the bombers from multiple directions most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> ended up exhausting their ammunition, resulting in twenty bombers being shot down in the 25 minutes before the escorting P-47s arrived.|$|E
5|$|One eye witness account {{suggested}} {{some of the}} downed JG 1 pilots {{faced the}} wrath of Belgium civilians, citing that the body of one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> was stripped and attacked by an angry mob. Another pilot, Unteroffizier Fritz Hoffman, barely escaped by surrendering to Allied forces after being shot down by Flight Lieutenant Czesław Mroczyk of 317 Squadron. Feldwebel Paul Mayr and Leutnant Ernst Von Johannides were also shot down by No. 317 Squadron. In turn, Flight Lieutenant Tadeusz Powierza was shot down and killed. Another Allied pilot crash-landed after downing a German aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Although the CSBS {{and similar}} designs allowed <b>the</b> {{calculation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proper flight angle needed to correct for windage, it was normally not visible to <b>the</b> <b>pilot.</b> In early bombers the bomb aimer was normally positioned in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> and could indicate corrections by hand signals, but as aircraft grew larger it became common for <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> and bomb aimer to be separated. This led to <b>the</b> introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> direction indicator, or PDI. These typically {{consisted of a}} pair of electrical pointers mounted in a conventional aircraft instrument panel mount (a small dial). The bombardier used switches to move the pointer on his unit, which was repeated in the cockpit in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilot.</b>|$|R

5|$|SG 4′s {{mission was}} also a disaster. During the {{assembly}} phase, they flew across JG 11′s flight path, and the formation was broken up. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> joined JG 11 in the confusion. Unable to recover the formation, I and II./SG 4 then decided to head home. The Kommodore, Druschel, had continued with five other pilots from III./SG 4 who had lost contact with their Gruppe. They crossed the front near Hürtgenwald around 09:10. As they did so, American anti-aircraft batteries opened fire, claiming seven aircraft in the next 30 minutes. Only six of the 50 Fw 190s of SG 4 carried out an attack, against airfields near Aachen and the Asch aerodrome. Of these six, four did not return. Druschel himself was reported missing.|$|E
5|$|With the {{acquiescence}} of the British government, 24 U.S. Air Force F-111F fighter-bombers {{took off}} from U.S. air bases in England.

Ribas-Dominicci was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots</b> {{who participated in the}} Libyan air raid. His F-111 was shot down over the disputed Gulf of Sidra off the Libyan coast. Ribas-Dominicci and his weapons systems officer, Captain Paul F. Lorence, were the only U.S. casualties. Al-Qaddafi, who was also personally targeted, escaped harm, but his daughter was killed.|$|E
5|$|Following the Pakrac {{clash between}} Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March 1991, the {{conflict}} had escalated into the Croatian War of Independence. The JNA stepped in, increasingly supporting the Croatian Serb insurgents. In early April, {{the leaders of}} the Croatian Serb revolt declared their intention to integrate the area under their control, known as SAO Krajina, with Serbia. In May, the Croatian government responded by forming the Croatian National Guard (Zbor narodne garde - ZNG), but its development was hampered by a United Nations (UN) arms embargo introduced in September. The Brioni Agreement established an observer mission which was eventually called the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM). The mission was tasked with monitoring the disengagement of belligerents in the Ten-Day War in neighbouring Slovenia, and the withdrawal of the JNA from Slovenia. However, on 16 August, an ECMM helicopter was hit by Croatian Serb gunfire in western Slavonia, injuring one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots.</b> This caused the ECMM's scope of work to be formally expanded to include Croatia on 1 September.|$|E

5|$|In June 2008, Goldstein and Travis Barker began collaborating {{under the}} name TRV$DJAM. They {{performed}} at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards on September 7, 2008. On September 19, after performing at a college event, he and Barker were aboard a Learjet 60 when it crashed upon takeoff in Columbia, South Carolina. The crash killed both crew members {{and the other two}} passengers, a security guard and Barker's assistant, critically injuring Goldstein and Barker. Goldstein suffered third-degree burns to his arm and parts of his head. Both he and Barker were transported to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta, Georgia. Moore flew to be by Goldstein's side in hospital, and the media reported that they were dating again. He was released on September 26, 2008, and was expected to make a full recovery. In December 2008, Goldstein filed a civil lawsuit against the plane's charter company, Learjet and Goodyear tires; the suit claimed negligence on the part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pilots,</b> and a manufacturing defect on part of the plane. He asked for damages for pain and suffering, mental anguish, disfigurement and loss of earnings. The lawsuit was settled by his estate in 2010, a year after his death.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 3 May, Dukovac and another pilot were escorting Hs 129s when they encountered a group of seven Ilyushin Il-2 ground attack aircraft and six fighters. During the engagement, Dukovac's aircraft was damaged and he force-landed, but not before claiming one of the Il-2s. The following morning, Dukovac and two others sortied on a He 111 escort mission, after which Dukovac again force-landed, this time near Varenikovskaya. On 5 May, Dukovac made three claims: two LaGG-3s in the morning, and another during a Ju 87 escort mission in the evening. The following evening, Dukovac shot down another LaGG-3 while escorting Ju 87s. On 8 May, he claimed yet another LaGG-3 during an escort mission for a Fieseler Fi 156 Storch liaison aircraft.
