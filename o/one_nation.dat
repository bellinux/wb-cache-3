5|$|Heather Hill, a {{woman with}} Australian and United Kingdom dual citizenship, was a Queensland {{candidate}} for the Australian Senate for <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> who contested the 1998 federal election. At the election on 3 October 1998, Hill received 295,903 first preference votes and was accordingly elected without the {{need to consider the}} distribution of preferences.|$|E
5|$|Terry Sharples, {{a former}} <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> {{candidate}} who had stood for the Senate in the 1998 election {{as an independent}} candidate, made a similar petition. Because both cases involved constitutional questions, and were substantially identical, they were heard together from 11–13 May 1999.|$|E
50|$|The 1987 Rugby World Cup was {{hosted by}} both Australia and New Zealand. 32 matches were played from {{over a period}} of 22 May to 20 June. The tournament {{featured}} <b>one</b> African <b>nation,</b> three American <b>nations,</b> <b>one</b> Asian <b>nation,</b> seven European nations and four Oceanic <b>nations.</b> <b>One</b> notable omission was the Springboks who were not competing due to the international sports boycott.|$|R
50|$|In {{the same}} year, Masroor Ahmad {{delivered}} an address on Islam’s Teachings of Loyalty and Love for <b>One’s</b> <b>Nation</b> at the German headquearters in Koblenz.|$|R
5000|$|Developing {{the public}} {{awareness}} {{as an essential}} milestone in the total development of <b>one’s</b> <b>nation</b> as the Centre believes that any civilization starts and ends with humans themselves.|$|R
5|$|If {{a player}} who has never played in an IIHF {{competition}} changes their citizenship, they must participate in national competitions in their new country {{for at least two}} consecutive years and have an international transfer card (ITC). If {{a player who}} has previously played in an IIHF tournament wishes to change their national team, they must have played in their new country for four years. A player can only do this once. The original IOC rules stated that an athlete that had already played for <b>one</b> <b>nation</b> could not later change nations under any circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In August 1810, Tecumseh led 400 armed warriors {{down the}} Wabash River {{to meet with}} Harrison in Vincennes. As the warriors were dressed in war paint, their sudden {{appearance}} at first frightened the soldiers at Vincennes. The leaders of the group were escorted to Grouseland, where they met Harrison. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne Treaty was illegitimate. He argued that no one tribe could sell land without {{the approval of the}} other tribes; he asked Harrison to nullify it and warned that Americans should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Tecumseh informed Harrison that he had threatened to kill the chiefs who signed the treaty if they carried out its terms, and that his confederation of tribes was growing rapidly. Harrison said the Miami were the owners of the land and could sell it if they so chose. He rejected Tecumseh's claim that all the Indians formed <b>one</b> <b>nation.</b> He said each tribe could have separate relations with the United States if they chose to. Harrison argued that the Great Spirit would have made all the tribes speak one language if they were to be <b>one</b> <b>nation.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{international}} politics, {{food power}} {{is the use of}} agriculture as a means of political control whereby <b>one</b> <b>nation</b> or group of nations offers or withholds commodities from another nation or group of nations in order to manipulate behavior. Its potential use as a weapon was recognised after OPEC’s earlier use of oil as a political weapon. Food has a major influence on political actions of a nation. In response to acts of food power, a nation usually acts in the interest of its citizens to provide food.|$|E
50|$|The 13th {{edition of}} the Mediterranean Games were held in Bari, Italy from the 13th to the 25th of June 1997. Twenty <b>one</b> <b>nations</b> competed in 27 {{different}} sporting events.|$|R
50|$|In its history, <b>one</b> <b>nations</b> have {{hosted the}} Asian Martial Arts Games. Thirty-seven nations from Asia {{have participated in}} the Games.The last Games was held in Bangkok, Thailand from 1 August to 9 August 2009.|$|R
2500|$|The 1987 Rugby World Cup was {{hosted by}} both Australia and New Zealand. 32 matches were played from {{over a period}} of 22 May to 20 June. [...] The tournament {{featured}} <b>one</b> African <b>nation,</b> three American <b>nations,</b> <b>one</b> Asian <b>nation,</b> seven European nations and four Oceanic <b>nations.</b> [...] <b>One</b> notable omission was the Springboks who were not competing due to the international sports boycott.|$|R
5|$|In {{the distant}} future, {{thousands}} of years after a great war between humans and their biologically engineered weapons, humans live in everything from small tribes to large nations. <b>One</b> <b>nation,</b> the Empire, has discovered a black tower {{in the middle of}} a lake near their capital, which gave them access to large amounts of ancient weapons which they used to beat back and control the ever present monsters in the world. The Imperials were corrupted by this power and became conquerors of others as opposed to liberators from a violent world.|$|E
5|$|My {{course has}} come to an end. I have fought your battles, and you have given me that loyalty that led us to victory more often than the party has ever had since the days of Sir John A. Macdonald. In my retiring, I have nothing to {{withdraw}} in my desire to see Canada, my country and your country, <b>one</b> <b>nation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Television {{broadcasts}} of Paralympic Games {{began in}} 1976, but this early coverage {{was confined to}} taped-delay releases to <b>one</b> <b>nation</b> or region. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics there were 45hours of live coverage but it was available only in Europe. Other countries broadcast highlight packages during the Games. No meaningful improvements in coverage occurred until the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney.|$|E
40|$|Conceptualisations of {{attachment}} to <b>one’s</b> <b>nation</b> of origin reflecting a symbolic caregiver {{can be found}} cross-culturally in literature, art, and language. Despite its prevalence, the relationship with <b>one’s</b> <b>nation</b> has not been investigated empirically {{in terms of an}} attachment theory framework. Two studies employed an attachment theory approach to investigate the construct validity of symbolic attachment to <b>one’s</b> <b>nation</b> of origin, and its association with acculturation (operationalized as heritage and mainstream culture identification). Results for Study 1 indicated a three-factor structure of nation attachment; the factors were labelled secure-preoccupied, fearful, and dismissive nation attachment. Hierarchical linear modelling was employed to control for differing cultures across participants. Secure-preoccupied nation attachment {{was a significant predictor of}} increased heritage culture identification for participants residing in their country of birth, whilst dismissive nation attachment was a significant predictor of decreased heritage culture identification for international migrants. Securepreoccupied nation attachment was also associated with higher levels of subjective-wellbeing. Study 2 further confirmed the validity of the nation attachment construct through confirmatory factor analysis; the three-factor model adequately fit the data. Similar to the results of Study 1, secure-preoccupied nation attachment was associated with increased levels of heritage culture identification and psychological well-being. Implications of the tripartite model of nation attachment for identity and well-being will be discussed...|$|R

5|$|Internationally, George {{maintained}} {{a strong relationship}} with his brother-in-law, the Prince of Wales (eventually King Edward VII of the United Kingdom), and sought his help in defusing the recurring and contentious issue of Crete, an overwhelmingly Greek island that remained under Ottoman Turk control. Since the reign of Otto, the Greek desire to unite Greek lands in <b>one</b> <b>nation</b> had been a sore spot with the United Kingdom and France, which had embarrassed Otto by occupying the main Greek port Piraeus to dissuade Greek irredentism during the Crimean War. During the Cretan Revolt (1866–1869), the Prince of Wales sought the support of British Foreign Secretary Lord Derby to intervene in Crete on behalf of Greece. Ultimately, the Great Powers did not intervene and the Ottomans put down the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|Tetragrammaton {{issued the}} album in a stark {{gatefold}} sleeve, wrapped {{around with a}} segmented illustration from Hieronymus Bosch's painting The Garden of Earthly Delights. The label ran into difficulty {{over the use of}} the Museo del Prado-owned painting, which was incorrectly perceived in the US as being anti-religious, featuring immoral scenes, and was thus rejected or poorly stocked by many record shops. The original painting is in colour although it appeared on the LP in monochrome due to a printing error for the original layout and the band opted to keep it that way. Another section of the same Bosch painting (in colour) had previously been used as an album cover two years before by Pearls Before Swine on their debut <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> Underground.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Charter {{requires}} that an athlete {{be a national}} {{of the country for}} which they compete. Dual nationals may compete for either country, as long as three years have passed since the competitor competed for the former country. However, if the NOCs and IF involved agree, then the IOC Executive Board may reduce or cancel this period. This waiting period exists only for athletes who previously competed for <b>one</b> <b>nation</b> and want to compete for another. If an athlete gains a new or second nationality, then they do not need to wait any designated amount of time before participating for the new or second nation. The IOC is only concerned with issues of citizenship and nationality after individual nations have granted citizenship to athletes.|$|E

25|$|The Canada {{national}} rugby union team {{is governed}} by Rugby Canada, and play in red and white. Canada is classified by World Rugby as a tier two rugby nation. There are ten tier <b>one</b> <b>nations,</b> and thirteen tier two nations. Canada competes in competitions such as the Pacific Nations Cup and the Rugby World Cup.|$|R
5|$|The court {{declared}} that Hill was not validly elected at the 1998 federal election. However, {{they did not}} declare the whole election invalid, acting on an earlier decision of the court, because although no effect could be given to voters' preferences for Hill, their other preferences were not invalid, and those {{could be used to}} determine who should be elected in Hill's stead. The court did not reach a definite decision about what action should be taken, remitting that question to a lower court. Eventually, Len Harris, the number two candidate on the <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> ticket, was elected in Hill's stead, taking up his seat on 1 July 1999.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{no country}} in Africa has a {{permanent}} {{seat on the}} Security Council. Although no <b>one</b> <b>nation</b> from Africa has formally been put forward {{as a candidate for}} membership on the Security Council, Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa, and Nigeria are seen as the strongest choices. Algeria has gained {{a great deal of respect}} for its neutrality over the years and its great commitment to African development; Egypt has the second-largest economy in Africa and the biggest military on the continent, was one of the founding members of the United Nations, enjoys great influence in Africa and in the Arab world, and hosts the headquarters of the Arab League; Ethiopia was also one of the founding members of the United Nations and holds the seat of the African Union Commission; South Africa has the third-largest economy on the continent; and Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, has the continent's largest economy, and is one of the largest contributors of military and civilian personnel to UN peacekeeping missions.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> {{won three}} {{seats in the}} Western Australian Legislative Council at the 2001 state election, but the electoral success of <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> began to {{deteriorate}} after this point because the split-away of <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> NSW began to spark further lack of party unity, {{and a series of}} gaffes by <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> members and candidates, particularly in Queensland.|$|E
5000|$|Of the Tier <b>One</b> <b>nations,</b> Italy is {{the only}} one not to have made it to at least the quarter-finals in any Rugby World Cup. Conversely, three Tier Two {{countries}} have made it to the quarter-finals - Fiji in 1987 and 2007, Canada in 1991 and Samoa (then called Western Samoa) in 1991 and 1995.|$|R

25|$|In November 2014, Hanson {{announced}} that she had returned as <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> leader, prior to the party's announcement, following support from <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> party members. She {{announced that}} she would contest the seat of Lockyer in the 2015 Queensland state election. <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> held the Queensland seat of Lockyer from 1998 to 2004. In February 2015, Hanson {{took the lead in}} early vote counts for the seat, before losing by a narrow margin.|$|E
25|$|At the 1999 election, <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> {{politician}} David Oldfield {{was elected}} to the New South Wales Legislative Council, the state parliament's upper house. However, in 2000, Oldfield was expelled from <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> for an alleged verbal dispute with Hanson. Within weeks, Oldfield had established the splinter group, <b>One</b> <b>Nation</b> NSW, an organisation similar to the historical Lang Labor and Democratic Labor parties, which were splinter groups of the original Australian Labor Party.|$|E

50|$|A {{military}} parade is {{a formation}} of soldiers whose movement is restricted by close-order manouvering known as drilling or marching. The military parade is now almost entirely ceremonial, though soldiers from time immemorial {{up until the}} late 19th century fought in formation. Massed parades may also hold a role for propaganda purposes, being used to exhibit the apparent military strength of <b>one's</b> <b>nation.</b>|$|R
50|$|National {{identity}} {{requires the}} process of self-categorization and it involves both the identification of in-group (identifying with <b>one's</b> <b>nation),</b> and differentiation of out-groups (other nations). By recognizing commonalities such as having common descent and common destiny, people identify with a nation and form an in-group, {{and at the same}} time they view people that identify with a different nation as out-groups.|$|R
