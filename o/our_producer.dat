25|$|I {{resisted}} it completely. I just didn't {{know how}} we could make it last for two hours. But 20th Century Fox was really keen; <b>our</b> <b>producer</b> was really keen. So we thought, OK, we'll write the script. And after three months, we fell {{madly in love with}} the script. Unfortunately, Fox did not.|$|E
500|$|Nicole {{had a brief}} {{relationship}} with Penn Graham (Christian Clark) and after he was murdered, she discovered {{that she was pregnant}} with his child. James told Sunrise that viewers could expect a [...] "realistic portrayal of teen pregnancy" [...] and she explained {{that it was important to}} respect the issue. She added [...] "We took it very seriously with the writers, and you do a lot of research and things like that. You can only do your best, I guess!" [...] Nicole later told Marilyn Chambers (Emily Symons) about the baby and she offered to adopt it. James later revealed that when she joined Home and Away she told the writers that they can do anything with her character, except make her pregnant. Of the moment she was told that Nicole was going to have a baby, James said [...] "I went in to see <b>our</b> <b>producer</b> later and he said, 'Okay, I'm going to apologise in advance - we're making Nicole pregnant!'" [...] She initially did not want to portray a [...] "typical soap teenage pregnancy" [...] as she thought Nicole should be different. However the situation was explained to her and she became excited at the challenging storyline ahead.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, former [...] "good-girl" [...] Cassie {{becomes a}} rebellious teenager; Nick and Sharon have a {{difficult}} time dealing with her. Cassie has a crush on bad-boy Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei), who is dating Lily Winters (Christel Khalil). One night, against her parents' wishes she sneaks out to a party. In a ploy to impress a drunken Daniel she attempts to drive him home, despite being underage. The car crashes, leaving them with no memory of the accident. Daniel is thought to have been driving, and is blamed for the accident. A weakened Cassie escapes from the hospital to find Daniel and tell him she was driving; she is returned to the hospital. During the episode dated May 24, Cassie dies with Nick and Sharon at her side. Grimes said she did not think Cassie would die, but if it was [...] "meant to happen, it's meant to happen". The actress found filming her last scenes with Case and Morrow [...] "ridiculously hard". Daniel is cleared of all charges and Nick and Sharon begin Cassie's Foundation, a movement to prevent teenage drinking and driving. Following her death, the strong relationship between Nick and Sharon changes forever. Weighing in on the [...] "groundbreaking" [...] and [...] "shocking" [...] plot, Morrow stated, [...] "As a person who watched Camryn grow up, I was devastated and it was not that difficult to use those feelings in the scenes we had to play. But as an actor, I have to commend <b>our</b> <b>producer</b> and writers at that time because it gave the show a huge new storyline that years later we are still playing out". He felt that losing a child gave Nick [...] "an edge and a change" [...] that affected him deeply. In 2012, during a court battle over Newman Enterprises (the family company), Nick tells a judge that Sharon's mental problems date to Cassie's death. Luke Kerr of Zap2it referred to this as playing the [...] "Cassie card".|$|E

2500|$|The two new {{tracks were}} {{produced}} by Brandon Friesen, {{who has also}} been overseeing sessions for the band's next studio album. Consisting of songs written by Pritchard while the other band members spent time with their families, the new album is deemed {{to be more of}} a band effort, as opposed to Listen which was constructed individually. [...] "This one’s very much 'us' – all rehearsing songs, all arranging songs, all playing together. It’s got the same sort of energy that we had on our first couple of albums, which we were probably running away from a little bit for a while, but now we’ve gone back to it," [...] said Pritchard. [...] "Brandon Friesen, <b>our</b> <b>producer,</b> has taken more of a production role than me, so I won’t be taking the credit. On Listen, me and Inflo worked together everyday. But this one’s been much more of a band record. It’s been far more collaborative." ...|$|E

[...] said Riegel of the [...] "grueling" [...] day. [...] "It was insane, in fact. [...] and I were on the set from 9 a.m. to like 7:30 at night, {{just the two of}} us." [...] Havins agreed and relayed, [...] "It was so intense to tape. It was a long, long day, a 12-hour tape day." [...] They were warned by All My Children executives that the episode would be [...] "especially" [...] demanding. [...] "I don't think they've ever handed that much material to just two actresses before, so they wanted us to be prepared," [...] said Riegel. [...] "It was the most dialogue I've ever had in my entire life. To the point where several weeks before they gave me the script, <b>our</b> <b>producer,</b> Julie , sat us down and said to us, 'This is just so important.,'" [...] added Havins. [...] "And she turned to me and said, 'We're almost nervous because it's so much material. If it's too much, let us know.' It was that dialogue-heavy." ...|$|E

5000|$|Their {{name has}} various meanings: [...] "We like the {{symbolism}} of the color red - power, passion, love etc. With Redwine being <b>our</b> <b>producer</b> it made sense to keep the word 'RED' in the name, then we added the 'I' to represent the individuality that we each maintain and contribute to the group.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Placebo {{had planned}} to record a more electronic, keyboard-driven sound for their new album; however, {{producer}} Dimitri Tikovoi suggested a back-to-basics approach, which Brian Molko recounted in Zero:It was <b>our</b> <b>producer's</b> agenda really, which we didn't really know about until {{we got into the}} studio. ... We were in a place that was very much about samplers and computers and vintage synthesizers. This recording session really became about playing again. We were in an old-school studio so there were no real tricks to hide behind.|$|R
5000|$|Weeks later, CNN's Randi Kaye told an {{audience}} at West Virginia University {{that she had}} been listening to Cooper's interview from outside the Sago Baptist Church."I heard this unfolding on our air and I must have said something out loud because there was a print photographer standing beside me and he said, 'Did you just say what I think you said?' and I said, 'I think there's only one alive,'" [...] the CNHI News Service quoted Kaye as saying."Then one of <b>our</b> <b>producers</b> was screaming in my ear, 'Get confirmation.

It pained me, though, that my guitar was not cutting through...There's magic on it, but {{just not the}} magic that I had envisioned.|$|E
50|$|Mark Hulme, <b>our</b> <b>producer,</b> had {{an expert}} team of {{researchers}} to comb through all public records and interviews that {{had anything to do}} with Steve Jobs.

Millard was not sure the song would fit on the record, but Brown Bannister (the group's producer) told him [...] "You just made a grown man cry. It's going on the record".|$|E

I've worked hard with <b>our</b> <b>producers</b> to make sure that when you play our records on your stereo, you can feel the bass.

With this album we are eager to go back on the road and show our fans the new songs, outfits and tricks!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Daugherty's precise role in The Carpenters' {{recordings}} {{has been}} subjected to some controversy. When Richard was asked at a UK press conference what role Daugherty played in the duo's sound, he responded, [...] "Nothing. That's why he's no longer with us. We produced all these singles. It's a long story, but Jack {{had nothing to do with}} anything.

Pre-production basically entails getting together with the rhythm section and running through the songs. Sean Beavan - <b>our</b> <b>producer</b> - and I trimmed the fat off some of the tunes so they were new for me too. We all rehearsed as a group and played the newer, leaner arrangements to see how everything worked out.” ...|$|E
