The Daniel Lambert public house at 12 Ludgate Hill, {{near the entrance}} to St Paul's Cathedral in London, was well known, and had a large portrait <b>of</b> <b>Daniel</b> Lambert and Lambert's walking stick on display in the lobby.

5|$|Along {{with his}} {{scientific}} fame, Newton's {{studies of the}} Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture and Observations upon the Prophecies <b>of</b> <b>Daniel,</b> and the Apocalypse of St. John. He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.|$|E
5|$|Alphonso Boone, the {{grandson}} <b>of</b> <b>Daniel</b> Boone, settled {{in what would}} later become Wilsonville in 1846 and established the Boones Ferry across the Willamette River in 1847.

Originally, the area was part of what became Yamhill County, but was transferred to the current Clackamas County in 1855. The first post office was established in 1876 with the name, Boones Ferry.|$|E

5|$|Boone's adventures, {{real and}} mythical, {{formed the basis}} of the archetypal hero of the American West, popular in 19th-century novels and 20th-century films. The main {{character}} of James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales, the first of which was published in 1823, bore striking similarities to Boone; even his name, Nathaniel Bumppo, echoed Daniel Boone's name. As mentioned above, The Last of the Mohicans (1826), Cooper's second Leatherstocking novel, featured a fictionalized version of Boone's rescue of his daughter. After Cooper, other writers developed the Western hero, an iconic figure which began as a variation <b>of</b> <b>Daniel</b> Boone.|$|E

The Brocks were an English family who had been established in Guernsey since the sixteenth century. Brock earned a reputation during his early education on Guernsey as an assiduous student, {{as well as an}} exceptional swimmer and boxer. At age ten, he was sent to school in Southampton. He also studied for one year in Rotterdam, learning French.|$|E

The race ended spectacularly when the Red Bull <b>of</b> <b>Daniel</b> Ricciardo suffered an engine blow-up on the final straight, just being able to coast his car over the finish line.|$|E
