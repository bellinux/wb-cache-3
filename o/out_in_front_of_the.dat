5|$|During the protest, {{the crowd}} {{assaulted}} a JNA armoured personnel carrier {{and managed to}} remove a machine gun mounted on the vehicle, while one of the protesters, Ivica Balić, hoisted a Croatian flag at the building to singing of the Croatian anthem by the crowd. In a scuffle which broke <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, Saško Gešovski, a JNA conscript from Macedonia, {{was killed by a}} shot fired from the crowd. By the end of the afternoon, the crowd removed the Yugoslav flag from the building, moved away and dispersed.|$|E
5|$|East Lawn {{was laid}} <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east window {{and was used}} for grand bazaars and fêtes until the early 20th century. A ha-ha was {{installed}} behind to keep cattle out of the grounds. To {{the south of the}} priory buildings the Long Terrace ran almost the full length of the grounds. It afforded access to the ruins via a flight of steps flanked by two carved demi-sea wolves, reflecting the coat of arms of the Chaloners. They were thought to be dragons by local people and the steps were referred to as the Dragon Steps.|$|E
5|$|The march {{ended in}} a picket {{in front of the}} Banovina building, where the JNA had its {{headquarters}} in Split at the time. The protesters demanded an end to the JNA-imposed blockade of the village of Kijevo. Scuffles broke <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building, and a JNA soldier was killed by a gunshot reportedly fired from the crowd. Four organisers of the protest were arrested a month later by the JNA, tried in a military court and convicted. They were released months later in a prisoner exchange. The protest caused the JNA to withdraw a portion of military equipment previously based in Split to more secure locations and increase its combat readiness there. The blockade of Kijevo was lifted through negotiations days after the protest.|$|E

5|$|On lap 16, Valtteri Bottas {{reclaimed}} sixth {{position from}} Max Verstappen, {{a position he}} had lost at the start, while Hamilton started {{to close the gap}} to Rosberg in front. The German however reacted and extended his lead back to four seconds by lap 27. Meanwhile, Bottas went past Le Mans winner Nico Hülkenberg for fifth place on lap 26, but an earlier pit stop brought the German back <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Williams. For speeding in the pit lane, Carlos Sainz Jr. was handed a five-second time penalty, which was not to be applied since the Spaniard retired on lap 34 due to a technical problem. Prior to the pit stops {{at the front of the}} field, Lewis Hamilton was able to reduce the gap to 2.2 seconds by lap 32. When Rosberg made a pit stop one lap later, Hamilton led the race. Having thereby led a lap in seventeen consecutive races, Hamilton equalled a 45-year-old record set by Jackie Stewart, who had led at least one lap each between the 1968 United States Grand Prix and the 1970 Belgian Grand Prix.|$|E
5|$|Reaching {{the open}} fields again, the 21st was ordered by Maj. Gen. Philip Kearny {{to fill a}} hole {{in the center of the}} Union line. As the 21st advanced, Kearny rode <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> regiment, strenuously urging them to hurry, and refuting {{warnings}} that Confederates were close by. Kearny was killed by a volley from a force of Confederates concealed just inside a nearby tree line. Now in very close range to the enemy, a tense standoff ensued with leveled muskets as the 21st and the Confederate regiment each demanded the surrender of the other. Finally, the Confederate regiment charged on the 21st. It was the first time and last time, according to the regimental historian, that the 21st gave wounds with the bayonet. The hand-to-hand fighting was severe and great confusion resulted. Col. Clark was separated from the unit when most of the men around him were killed and he found himself lost in the Virginia countryside for four days before finding the unit again. This resulted in the mistaken printing of his obituary in Amherst.|$|E

25|$|On 1 May 2000, a {{time capsule}} was buried <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> library, by the Birkenhead war memorial. It {{contained}} various items such as maps, driver's licences, shopping receipts, and old library cards from the 1960s and 1970s. Blessed by a kaumatua from Awataha Marae it was planned to be dug up in one hundred years. On the plaque are quoted the opening two lines from T. S. Eliot's poem Burnt Norton.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the media}} and {{population}} criticized the use of the Pergamon Altar as a backdrop for the application submitted by the city of Berlin to host the Olympic summer games in 2000. The Senate of Berlin had invited the members of the IOC executive committee to a banquet taking place in front of the altar. That called to mind Berlin's application to host the games in 1936. Also at that time the Nazi Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick had invited the members of the IOC to a banquet laid <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> altar.|$|E
25|$|By late March sports {{writers were}} already penciling in Landrith as the {{definite}} opening day starter behind home plate for San Francisco, but on April 3 Landrith had a freak accident {{with his hand}} in an exhibition game against the Cubs, suffering a hair-line fracture {{on the back of}} his index finger. He hit the bat or helmet of Cubs hitter Lou Johnson when Lou got <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plate after a swinging strike out in the 4th inning. Landrith attempted to throw the ball to second base as Johnson swung his bat, causing the injury. Frank Bowman, trainer for the Giants, expected him to miss 10 days and opening day. He returned to batting practice on April 19 and pinch hit for the Giants on April 22 against the Cubs, but did not return to full action until almost a full month later on May 2.|$|E

25|$|With Lee now on {{the move}} and having crossed into Pennsylvania, the Union Army, now {{under the command of}} Gen. George Meade, marched there to stop him. On the morning of July 2 the 140th arrived south of the town of Gettysburg, with their 1st Division taking up a {{position}} on the left of the II Corps, adjoining the right end of Gen. Daniel Sickles’ III Corps. However, Sickles arbitrarily decided to move his troops <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the Union line, and was soon in trouble, being attacked by Confederates in the afternoon. Thus Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock dispatched the 1st Division to report to Gen. George Sykes to be placed in line of battle to assist Sickles, moving to the latter's left end. The 3rd Brigade, under Gen. Zook, who was mortally wounded, advanced on the right end of the division across The Wheatfield, with the 140th occupying the right flank of the brigade. They initially made progress in pushing back the Rebels, but with the onset of Confederate reinforcements and the subsequent collapse of the III Corps to their right, as well as the withdrawal of the division on the left, the brigade was compelled to retreat. Together with their brigade, the regiment occupied a position on the left center of the Union line {{for the remainder of the}} battle.|$|E
25|$|The {{inferior}} planet mechanism {{includes the}} sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus. For {{each of the}} three systems there is an epicyclic gear whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for epicyclic motion in the sun and all the planets—excepting only the moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn't interfere with the teeth; in some cases the needed distance between the gear's centre and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although {{there is no need for}} the waste of metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three epicyclic gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each. Five gears and three slotted bars in all.|$|E
500|$|The highly {{reflective}} costumes {{worn by the}} Kryptonians {{are made}} of the same 3M material used for the front projection screens and {{were the result of}} an accident during Superman flying tests. [...] "We noticed the material lit up on its own," [...] Donner explained. [...] "We tore the material into tiny pieces and glued it on the costumes, designing a front projection effect for each camera. There was a little light on each camera, and it would project into a mirror, bounce <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lens, hit the costume, [...] millions of little glass beads would light up and bring the image back into the camera." ...|$|E

500|$|Decoys are {{lighter than}} the RV, so they will suffer higher {{atmospheric}} drag as they begin to reenter the atmosphere. This will eventually cause the RV to move <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decoys. But the RV can often be picked out earlier by examining the threat tube {{as a whole and}} watching for objects that have lower deceleration. This process, known as atmospheric filtering, or more generally, decluttering, will not provide accurate information until the threat tube begins to reenter the denser portions of the atmosphere, at altitudes around [...] Nike-X intended to wait until the decluttering was complete, meaning the interceptions would take place only seconds before the warheads hit their targets, between [...] away from the base.|$|E
500|$|In a {{continuing}} attempt by Universal Interactive {{to take credit}} for Crash Bandicoot, Naughty Dog was told that it was not [...] "allowed" [...] to go to the first Electronic Entertainment Expo. In addition, there were leaked copies of the temporary box cover and press materials for the Electronic Entertainment Expo, upon which the Naughty Dog logo, in violation of the contract between Naughty Dog and Universal Interactive, was omitted. In response, Jason Rubin drafted and printed 1,000 copies of a document entitled [...] "Naughty Dog, creator and developer of Crash Bandicoot" [...] to hand <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crash Bandicoot display at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. Beforehand, Rubin passed out the flyers [...] "for review" [...] to Universal Interactive, angering its president. Crash Bandicoot was first shown at the Electronic Entertainment Expo on May 1996 and was met with enthusiastic reactions. The game was released on September 9, 1996. This was followed by its European release on November 8, 1996.|$|E
500|$|The halftime drill always {{begins with}} the band running into place at the command of the drum major's whistle. The {{announcer}} (Lieutenant Colonel Jay Brewer) then states, usually in unison with the crowd, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, now forming {{at the north end}} of Kyle Field, the nationally famous Fightin' Texas Aggie Band." [...] A whoop and cheers come from the audience. The drum majors then march <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> band and the head drum major calls the band to attention and vocally gives directions to the band, referencing the composition of the Aggie War Hymn, by shouting, [...] "Recall! Step off on Hullabaloo!" [...] (Recall is a traditional Army bugle call – the first 34 notes, and intro of the Aggie War Hymn. [...] "Hullabaloo" [...] is the first word sung in the Aggie War Hymn.) These directions are not amplified in any way, but can be heard across the entire stadium. After another whoop, the drum majors signal for the horns to be lifted into playing position with two quick whistle blasts and the bugle rank does a flourish.|$|E

500|$|In the Middle Ages, the hill’s sacred {{function}} was obscured by its other {{role as the}} center of the civic government of Rome, revived as a commune in the 11th century. The city's government was now to be firmly under papal control, but the Capitoline was the scene of movements of urban resistance, such as the dramatic scenes of Cola di Rienzo's revived republic. In 1144, a revolt by the citizens against the authority of the Pope and nobles led to a senator taking up his official residence on the Capitoline Hill. [...] The senator’s new palace turned its back on the ancient forum, beginning the change in orientation on the hill that Michelangelo would later accentuate. [...] A small piazza was laid <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> senator’s palace, intended for communal purposes. [...] In the middle of the 14th century, the guilds’ court of justice was constructed on {{the southern end of the}} piazza. [...] This would later house the Conservatori in the 15th century. [...] As a result, the piazza was already surrounded by buildings by the 16th century.|$|E

Jolie petitioned the court to legally remove her surname [...] "Voight" [...] in favor of her middle name, which she had long used as a stage name; the name change was granted on September 12, 2002. Voight then went public with their estrangement during an appearance on Access Hollywood, in which he claimed Jolie had [...] "serious mental problems." [...] At that point, her mother and brother also broke off contact with Voight. They did not speak for six-and-a-half years, but began rebuilding their relationship in the wake of Bertrand's death from ovarian cancer on January 27, 2007, before going public with their reconciliation three years later.|$|E
500|$|The porte-cochère of {{the hotel}} {{featured}} three great sharp-edged pillars jutting <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glass-fronted building, angling down into the ground, which resembled fins. The two-story glass walled entry was bordered by a wall of imported Italian marble, and above the entrance area was a horizontal plane with copper lights suspended from the beams. [...] Rather than being polished, the marble was unusual {{in that it was}} rough and grained. Natural and stained cork was used throughout the building. A.J. Leibling of The New Yorker described the hotel in 1953: [...] "The main building of the Sands is a great rectangular hall, with the reception desk in one corner, slot machines along one long wall and a bar and cocktail lounge, complete with Latin trio, along the opposite wall. In the middle is a jumble of roulette and craps tables and 21 layouts." [...] The casino, of substantial size, was accessed by three sets of terrazzo stairs, and was lit by low-hanging chandeliers. The bar featured bas-reliefs with a Western theme, including cowboys, racing wagons and Joshua trees, designed by Allan Stewart of Claremont College, California. The Garden Room restaurant overlooked the hotel's pool and landscaped grounds.|$|E
