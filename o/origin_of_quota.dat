40|$|Given their {{potential}} to negatively impact menâs goal {{of staying in}} office, can gender quotas be aligned with the preferences of male legislators who adopt the policy? In other words, does the rapid spread <b>of</b> gender <b>quotas</b> worldwide challenge notions of the rationality of legislators as career-driven individuals? These are the main questions that drive this thesis. To answer these questions, I develop a prospect theory-based framework that accounts for how electoral security and political ambition impact legislatorsâ behaviour in influencing the strength <b>of</b> gender <b>quota</b> designs. I argue that, faced with growing pressures to adopt gender quotas, male parliamentarians engage in the risk-taking process of assenting with gender quotas, meanwhile seeking to minimize the potential costs of the policy to their future careers by actively weakening quota designs. To evaluate the plausibility of my theory, I employ a series of multi-method and multi-level analyses presented across five substantive chapters, {{each of which is}} respectively based on: 1) a cross-sectional analysis of Latin America countries; 2) an elite survey experiment with Brazilian state legislators; and, in-depth process tracing of the cases <b>of</b> gender <b>quota</b> adoption in 3) Costa Rica; 4) Brazil; and, 5) Chile. The work makes three main contributions. Firstly, although previously identified, the resistance of male legislators towards gender quotas had never been systematically analysed in a comparative manner; focusing on the behaviour of male incumbents is thus a relevant contribution. Secondly, although various authors have provided explanations for the <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> gender <b>quota</b> adoptions, no work had ever comparatively assessed sources of the variation in gender quota designs. Thus, I move the study <b>of</b> gender <b>quotas</b> beyond the binary choice of adoption. Thirdly, I show that the static assumptions of endogenous institutionalism need to be modified by the introduction of risk, which can only be achieved by integrating the insights of prospect theory. </p...|$|R
50|$|Under Nativist {{political}} pressure, the Immigration Act of 1917 {{established an}} Asian Barred Zone of countries from which {{immigration to the}} U.S. was forbidden. The Cable Act of 1922 (Married Women's Independent Nationality Act) guaranteed independent-woman citizenship exclusively to women married to an alien eligible to naturalization. During the 1920s, when the Cable Act of 1922 was law, Asian {{men and women were}} excluded from American citizenship for being colored people. In practice, the Cable Act of 1922 reversed some racial-exclusion laws, and granted independent-woman citizenship exclusively to women married to white men; analogously, the Act allowed revocation of the U.S. citizenship of a white woman married an Asian man. Nonetheless, legalized Yellow Peril racism was challenged; in the Supreme Court case of Takao Ozawa v. United States (1922), a Japanese-American man tried to demonstrate that the Japanese are a white race eligible for naturalized U.S. citizenship, yet the Court ruled that the Japanese are not white people; two years later, the National <b>Origins</b> <b>Quota</b> <b>of</b> 1924 specifically excluded the Japanese from the country and U.S. citizenship.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{estimates}} the inefficiencies {{associated with the}} regionalisation <b>of</b> milk <b>quota</b> trade. An optimisation model is developed to estimate the economic value <b>of</b> <b>quota.</b> Quota values are aggregated to derive supply and demand curves under two scenarios; first where quotas can trade nationally and second where the trade <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> is regionally restricted. Quota trade is simulated and the consequent effects on supplier structure are estimated. Through the derivation of sectoral cumulative cost curves {{it is possible to}} estimate the impact <b>of</b> regionalising <b>quota</b> trade on sector efficiency. The model is solved using National Farm Survey data from Ireland and the inefficiencies <b>of</b> regionalised <b>quota</b> trade in Ireland is estimated at€ 20 million. The model is also used to quantify the effect of policy uncertainty on quota trade. The implications of an early abolition or expansion of the EU milk quota on quota trade is quantified. The paper concludes by discussing the implications <b>of</b> restricted <b>quota</b> trade, especially in the context <b>of</b> eventual <b>quota</b> removal...|$|R

40|$|To date, {{more than}} 100 {{countries}} have implemented some type <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> {{for women in}} their national legislatures, leading {{to one of the}} most significant developments in the global composition of legislative bodies in the past twenty-five years. One remaining puzzle in understanding the global diffusion <b>of</b> electoral gender <b>quotas</b> is the strong clustering <b>of</b> shared domestic <b>quota</b> policies by region. In this project, I examine the importance of dyadic relationships between countries, including shared membership in inter-governmental organizations (IGOs), regional organizations (ROs), and women’s international non-governmental organizations(WINGOs) in explaining the timing and type <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> adoption. To do this, I employ a social network approach to quantitatively model global and temporal trends in gender quota adoption. Controlling for other possible domestic and transnational determinants, my results indicate that the strongest predictor <b>of</b> <b>quota</b> policy adoption and design is the existence of similar policies in neighboring countries. These results suggest that, in the case <b>of</b> gender <b>quota</b> adoption, domestic policymakers see surrounding states as their most salient reference group when deciding both whether and how to implement new policy...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the signing}} of the Kyoto Protocol, future {{commitments}} are likely to be framed in terms <b>of</b> tradable <b>quotas.</b> The discussions on the allocation <b>of</b> the <b>quotas</b> among countries will be based - at least partly - on rules corresponding to a certain conception of equity. For instance, allocating quotas in direct proportion to population, in relation to GDP or according to past emissions has been advocated. Taking a long term perspective, we compute such allocations <b>of</b> tradable <b>quotas</b> with a dynamic (closed-loop) model. The total amount <b>of</b> <b>quotas</b> to be distributed at each period corresponds to the world optimal amount of emissions to be realized at each period.
