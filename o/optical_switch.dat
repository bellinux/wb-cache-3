The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes {{at either end of the}} module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell <b>optical</b> <b>switch.</b> To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics {{on either side of}} the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E

Based on different target applications: we categorize WDM <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> networks into two connection models: the wavelength-based model and the fiberlink-based model. Most of existing WDM <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> networksbelongtothefirst category. In this paper we present new designs for WDM <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> networks under both models by using sparse crossbar switches instead of full crossbar switches in combination with wavelength converters. The newly designed sparse WDM <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> networks have minimum hardware cost {{in terms of both}} the number of crosspoints and the number of wavelength converters.

25|$|Consider a solid {{consisting}} of a single molecular species and subjected to melting. Ultimately it is rendered to an isotropic state classically referred to as liquid. Mesophases occur before then when an intermediate state of order is still maintained as in the nematic, smectic, and columnar phases of liquid crystals. Mesophases thus exhibit anisotropy. For instance, LCD devices work on the <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> principle that obscures light or lets it pass. This switch is turned off and on by an electric field applied to the mesogen with director. The response of the director to the field is expressed with viscosity parameters, as in the Ericksen-Leslie theory in continuum mechanics developed by Jerald Ericksen and Frank Matthews Leslie.|$|E
25|$|The main {{amplification}} {{takes place}} in a series of glass amplifiers located {{at one end of the}} beamlines. Before firing, the amplifiers are first optically pumped by a total of 7,680 xenon flash lamps (the PAMs have their own smaller flash lamps as well). The lamps are powered by a capacitor bank which stores a total of 422MJ (117kWh) of electrical energy. When the wavefront passes through them, the amplifiers release some of the light energy stored in them into the beam. To improve the energy transfer the beams are sent though the main amplifier section four times, using an <b>optical</b> <b>switch</b> located in a mirrored cavity. In total these amplifiers boost the original 6J provided by the PAMs to a nominal 4MJ. Given the time scale of a few billionths of a second, the peak UV power delivered to the target is correspondingly very high, 500TW.|$|E

40|$|Current {{data centers}} (DCs) {{networks}} rely on electronic switching and point-to-point interconnects. When considering future DC requirements, point-to-point interconnects {{will lead to}} poor network scalability and large power consumption. For this reason several <b>optical</b> <b>switched</b> interconnects for DCs have been recently proposed. However, the proposed <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> solutions suffer from low flexibility and {{are not able to}} provide service differentiation. Furthermore, very few studies evaluate possible improvements in energy efficiency offered by <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> solutions. In this paper we introduce a novel architecture of interconnects for DCs based on hybrid <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> (HOS). HOS combines three different <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> paradigms, namely circuit, burst and packet switching within the same network. Furthermore, HOS envisages the use a two parallel <b>optical</b> <b>switches,</b> a slow and low power consuming switch for the transmission of data using circuits and long bursts, and a fast switch for the transmission of packets and short bursts. The possibility of choosing between circuits, bursts and packets ensures the flexibility required by future DCs.

In this Q-switched mode, output powers of 250 megawatts and pulse durations of 10 to 25 nanoseconds have been achieved. The high-intensity pulses may be efficiently frequency doubled to generate laser light at 532nm, or higher harmonics at 355, 266 and 213nm.|$|E

30|$|Telecommunication {{networks}} can {{be classified}} into access, metro, and core domains. Core networks consume {{a significant amount of}} energy as they support high capacities with very high data rates. Core networks depend on optical transmission. In particular, the IP over wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) technology is used for compensating increased Internet bandwidth requirements. For reducing the power consumption, the <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> solutions are chosen. The most significant advantage of the <b>optical</b> <b>switches</b> is that their power dissipation does not increase significantly as the data rate increases. Generally, three types of <b>optical</b> <b>switching</b> solutions - <b>optical</b> circuit <b>switching</b> (OCS), <b>optical</b> burst <b>switching</b> (OBS), and <b>optical</b> packet <b>switching</b> (OPS) - are considered. In OCS, low costs and power consumption reductions are proposed; however, flexibility and bandwidth utilization is restricted. OBS sets up data into bursts and decreases network costs and power, but results in high data losses at core nodes. The highest flexibility and resource utilization is obtained by OPS, and it can be considered as the best alternative for electronic switching. However, it needs complex optical components that lead to high power consumption.|$|R
