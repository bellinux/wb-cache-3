5|$|Plant use of {{endophytic}} {{fungi in}} defense {{is a very}} common phenomenon. Most plants have endophytes, microbial <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> live within them. While some cause disease, others protect plants from herbivores and pathogenic microbes. Endophytes can help the plant by producing toxins harmful to other <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> would attack the plant, such as alkaloid producing fungi which are common in grasses such as tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).|$|E
5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other bacteria in the sample. Often these {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E
50|$|An aerobic {{organism}} or aerobe is an <b>organism</b> <b>that</b> can survive and grow in an oxygenated environment.

5|$|The immune system, {{particularly}} the innate component, plays a decisive role in tissue repair after an insult. Key actors include macrophages and neutrophils, but other cellular actors, including γδ T cells, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), and regulatory T cells (Tregs), are also important. The plasticity of immune cells {{and the balance}} between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signals are crucial aspects of efficient tissue repair. Immune components and pathways are involved in regeneration as well, for example in amphibians. According to one hypothesis, <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> can regenerate could be less immunocompetent than <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> cannot regenerate.|$|E
5|$|A fungus (plural: fungi or funguses) is {{any member}} of the group of {{eukaryotic}} <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> includes microorganisms such as yeasts and molds, as well as the more familiar mushrooms. These organisms are classified as a kingdom, Fungi, which is separate from the other eukaryotic life kingdoms of plants and animals.|$|E
5|$|Although oxygen once {{promoted}} {{nitrogen fixation}} by making molybdenum available in water, it also directly poisons nitrogenase enzymes. Thus, in Earth's ancient history, after oxygen arrived {{in large quantities}} in Earth's air and water, <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> continued to fix nitrogen in aerobic conditions isolated and protected their nitrogen-fixing enzymes from too much oxygen in heterocysts or equivalent structures. This structural isolation of nitrogen fixation reactions in aerobic organisms continues to the present.|$|E
50|$|The phrase 'organism that persons' {{describes}} the impressions an organism expresses, and thereby {{resulting in the}} organism being the type of organism it is. As an ontological phenomenon, it is manifested in all organisms; for example a dog is an <b>organism</b> <b>that</b> dogs and a cat is an <b>organism</b> <b>that</b> cats.|$|R

5|$|Corals are shallow, colonial <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> {{integrate}} δ18O {{and trace}} elements into their skeletal aragonite (polymorph of calcite) crystalline structures, as they grow. Geochemistry anomalies within the crystalline structures of corals represent functions of temperature, salinity and oxygen isotopic composition.

5|$|Habitat {{modification}} or {{destruction is}} one of the most dramatic issues affecting amphibian species worldwide. As amphibians generally need aquatic and terrestrial habitats to survive, threats to either habitat can affect populations. Hence, amphibians may be more vulnerable to habitat modification than <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> only require one habitat type. Large scale climate changes may further be modifying aquatic habitats, preventing amphibians from spawning altogether.|$|E
5|$|In {{homes and}} urban environments, the pests are the rodents, birds, insects and other <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> share the habitat with humans, and that feed on and spoil possessions. Control of these pests is {{attempted}} through exclusion, repulsion, physical removal or chemical means. Alternatively, various methods of biological control {{can be used}} including sterilisation programmes.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} behind immunization is {{to introduce}} an antigen, {{derived from a}} disease-causing <b>organism,</b> <b>that</b> stimulates the immune system to develop protective immunity against <b>that</b> <b>organism,</b> but <b>that</b> does not itself cause the pathogenic effects of <b>that</b> <b>organism.</b> An antigen (short for antibody generator), is defined as any substance that binds to a specific antibody and elicits an adaptive immune response.|$|R

These include macroalgae like Ulva lactuca, Ceramiumspp., Plocamiumspp., Cladophoraspp., Chorda filum, Fucus vesiculosus, Pylaiellaspp. and the introduced Sargassum muticum; hydrozoans like Obeliaspp. and Tubularia indivisa; bryozoans; tube-building amphipods like Monocorophium acherusicum and Jassa marmorata; and even soft-bodied tunicates like Ascidiella aspersa and Ciona intestinalis.|$|E
5|$|One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been {{introduced}} into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as over-fishing and long-term environmental changes that promoted {{the growth of the}} Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.|$|E
5|$|Species are broadly {{categorized}} as autotrophs (or primary producers), heterotrophs (or consumers), and Detritivores (or decomposers). Autotrophs are <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> {{produce their own}} food (production is greater than respiration) by photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. Heterotrophs are <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> must feed on others for nourishment and energy (respiration exceeds production). Heterotrophs can be further sub-divided into different functional groups, including primary consumers (strict herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivorous predators that feed exclusively on herbivores), and tertiary consumers (predators that feed on a mix of herbivores and predators). Omnivores do not fit neatly into a functional category because they eat both plant and animal tissues. It {{has been suggested that}} omnivores have a greater functional influence as predators, because compared to herbivores, they are relatively inefficient at grazing.|$|E

5|$|The {{classification}} of archaea into species is also controversial. Biology defines a species {{as a group}} of related organisms. The familiar exclusive breeding criterion (<b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> can breed with each other but not with others) is of no help here because archaea reproduce asexually.|$|E
5|$|The first {{form of life}} {{to develop}} on the Earth were microbes, and they {{remained}} the only form of life until about a billion years ago when multi-cellular organisms began to appear. Microorganisms are single-celled <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> are generally microscopic, and smaller than the human eye can see. They include Bacteria, Fungi, Archaea, and Protista.|$|E
5|$|The fungal {{cell wall}} is {{composed}} of glucans and chitin; while glucans are also found in plants and chitin in the exoskeleton of arthropods, fungi are the only <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> combine these two structural molecules in their cell wall.

5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> can cause spontaneous enzootic abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E
5|$|Brachiopods are shelled marine <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> superficially resembled {{bivalves}} in {{that they}} are of similar size and have a hinged shell in two parts. However, brachiopods evolved from a very different ancestral line, and the resemblance to bivalves only arose because of a similar lifestyle. The {{differences between the two groups}} are due to their separate ancestral origins. Different initial structures have been adapted to solve the same problems, a case of convergent evolution. In modern times, brachiopods are not as common as bivalves.|$|E
5|$|During evolution, some {{structures}} {{may lose}} their original function and become vestigial structures. Such structures {{may have little}} or no function in a current species, yet have a clear function in ancestral species, or other closely related species. Examples include pseudogenes, the non-functional remains of eyes in blind cave-dwelling fish, wings in flightless birds, the presence of hip bones in whales and snakes, and sexual traits in <b>organisms</b> <b>that</b> reproduce via asexual reproduction. Examples of vestigial structures in humans include wisdom teeth, the coccyx, the vermiform appendix, and other behavioural vestiges such as goose bumps and primitive reflexes.|$|E
