Southerners {{accused him of}} being an abolitionist, which he hotly denied. Fillmore responded to one Alabamian in a widely published letter that slavery was an evil, but one that the federal government had no authority over. Taylor and Fillmore corresponded twice in September, with the general happy that the crisis over the South Carolinians was resolved. Fillmore, for his part, assured his running mate that the electoral prospects for the ticket looked good, especially in the Northeast.|$|E

5|$|By {{two days}} after the storm, the {{government}} of Mexico sent two airplanes to Acapulco, where the food, clothing, and medicine were distributed by truck or helicopter to the affected areas. The Mexican government arranged plans to drop food and medical aid into isolated villages, although food supplies were initially insufficient for the great number of people affected by the storm. Five army units and three helicopters were sent to the region to assist in the aftermath, although planes encountered difficulties in landing due to flooded runways. Army soldiers were responsible for rescue operations, while paratroopers were sent to the most affected areas to distribute aid. Despite fears <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of disease in the aftermath, prompt work by medical officials prevented any epidemics due to the storm.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the Spanish Civil War, Hitler gave several possible motives for German involvement. Among these were the distraction it provided from German re-militarisation; the prevention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of communism to Western Europe; {{the creation of a}} state friendly to Germany to disrupt Britain and France; and the possibilities for economic expansion. Although the offensive on Madrid was abandoned in March 1937, a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas was supported by Germany; despite prolonging the Civil War, it would help to distract the other western powers from Hitler's ambitions in central Europe. The offensive on Vizcaya, a mining and industrial centre, would help fuel German industry. On 27 June 1937, Hitler (in a speech at Wurzburg) declared he supported Franco to gain control of Spanish ore.|$|E
5|$|Silk {{cultivation}} {{spread to}} Japan around 300 CE, and, by 522 CE, the Byzantines managed to obtain silkworm eggs {{and were able}} to begin silkworm cultivation. The Arabs also began to manufacture silk during this same time. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of sericulture, Chinese silk exports became less important, although they still maintained dominance over the luxury silk market. The Crusades brought silk production to Western Europe, in particular to many Italian states, which saw an economic boom exporting silk to the rest of Europe. Changes in manufacturing techniques also began to take place during the Middle Ages, with devices such as the spinning wheel first appearing. During the 16th century France joined Italy in developing a successful silk trade, though the efforts of most other nations to develop a silk industry of their own were unsuccessful.|$|E

Quarantine measures against ships coming from the Dutch Republic {{were put in place}} in 29 other ports from May, commencing with Great Yarmouth. The Dutch ambassador objected at the constraint of trade with his country, but England responded that it {{had been one of the}} last countries introducing such restrictions. Regulations were enforced quite strictly, so that people or houses where voyagers had come ashore without serving their quarantine were also subjected to 40 days quarantine.|$|E

5|$|After {{shedding}} {{the burden}} of less profitable and unwieldy land with its angry residents, Burnside was on its own. The new Burnside District Council held its first meeting at the Greengate Inn, Tusmore on 19 August 1856. Due to {{the time it took}} to elect new councillors, it was not until 29 December that the council met again. Dr Christopher Penfold, chairman, met the rest of the representatives there: Daniel Ferguson of Glenunga, Alexander Ferguson of Monreith, John Townsend of Magill and James Grylls of Belle Vue. It was during this time that Kent Town decided against becoming a part of Burnside and instead applied to enter the Corporate Town of Kensington and Norwood. The council was to meet at the Inn or at Ferguson's home right up until December 1869, when the first council chambers were built. However, it was still able to operate and fulfill its obligations under the Local Government Act 1852. These included the management of minor roads, the administration of abattoir licences and public houses, and the prevention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spread</b> of the noxious Scotch thistle. The council was also obliged, under a different act of 1851, to encourage education. Much road and bridgework activity happened after the council had been formed—early residents were amazed at the influx of development and construction that occurred. At the same time, the council was almost overwhelmed by the amount of work requested, and was forced to ask individual ratepayers for monetary assistance when building bridges in their area.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> {{identifying a}} linear deterministic operator from an input-output measurement.

This result holds for arbitrary (possibly fragmented) support regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> function, does not impose limitations on <b>the</b> total extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> support region, and, most importantly, does not require <b>the</b> support region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> function to be known prior to identification. Furthermore, we prove that asking for identifiability of only almost all operators, stable identifiability is possible if D <= 1. This result is surprising as it says {{that there is no}} penalty for not knowing <b>the</b> support region <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> function prior to identification.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{deals with}} <b>the</b> {{application}} <b>of</b> linear multi-user detectors in <b>the</b> mobile terminal <b>of</b> a LEO (Low Earth Or-bit) satellite system with CDMA (Code Division Multiple Ac-cess). Since, no information <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> sequences <b>of</b> other users is given and {{since there are}} no training sequences, a blind adaptive interference detector (BAID) with low complexity is needed. All concepts proposed till now are based on short spreading codes, this means that <b>the</b> period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> sequences has <b>the</b> length <b>of</b> one symbol. However, real satellite communication systems use long codes. In this paper a new scheme is proposed, which can be applied on long codes. By cas-cading multiple separated BAIDs (cBAID) the adaptation is done every N symbols, when <b>the</b> same part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spreading</b> sequence appears.

40|$|Metaphase {{chromosome}} <b>spreading</b> is <b>the</b> {{most crucial}} step required for successful karyotyping and FISH analysis.
