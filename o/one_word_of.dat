25|$|Acronyms of {{the second}} group are created from longer parts of the {{original}} words (in fact, at least <b>one</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> the original should keep at least two letters, not including digraphs).

25|$|There are {{two basic}} {{experimental}} methods used to conduct cued recall, the study-test method and the anticipation method. In the study-test method participants study a list of word pairs presented individually. Immediately after or after a time delay, participants are tested in the study phase of the experiment on the word pairs just previously studied. <b>One</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> each pair is presented in a random order and the participant is asked to recall the item with which it was originally paired. The participant can be tested for either forward recall, Ai {{is presented as a}} cue for Bi, or backward recall, Bi is presented as a cue for Ai. In the anticipation method, participants are shown Ai and are asked to anticipate the word paired with it, Bi. If the participant cannot recall the word, the answer is revealed. During an experiment using the anticipation method, the list of words is repeated until a certain percentage of Bi words are recalled.|$|E
25|$|He {{journeyed to}} Peshawar {{with the help}} of the Abwehr, where he was met by Akbar Shah, Mohammed Shah and Bhagat Ram Talwar. Bose was taken to the home of Abad Khan, a trusted friend of Akbar Shah's. On 26 January 1941, Bose began his journey to reach Russia through British India's North West {{frontier}} with Afghanistan. For this reason, he enlisted the help of Mian Akbar Shah, then a Forward Bloc leader in the North-West Frontier Province. Shah had been out of India en route to the Soviet Union, and suggested a novel disguise for Bose to assume. Since Bose could not speak <b>one</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> Pashto, it would make him an easy target of Pashto speakers working for the British. For this reason, Shah suggested that Bose act deaf and dumb, and let his beard grow to mimic those of the tribesmen. Bose's guide Bhagat Ram Talwar, unknown to him, was a Soviet agent.|$|E

25|$|Knowing {{the meaning}} of a lexical item {{therefore}} means knowing the semantic entailments the word brings with it. However, it is also possible to understand only <b>one</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> a semantic field without understanding other related words. Take, for example, a taxonomy of plants and animals: it is possible to understand the words rose and rabbit without knowing what a marigold or a muskrat is. This is applicable to colors as well, such as understanding the word red without knowing {{the meaning of}} scarlet, but understanding scarlet without knowing the meaning of red may be less likely. A semantic field can thus be very large or very small, depending on the level of contrast being made between lexical items. While cat and dog both fall under the larger semantic field of animal, including the breed of dog, like German shepherd, would require contrasts between other breeds of dog (e.g. corgi, or poodle), thus expanding the semantic field further.|$|E
25|$|Although same-language {{subtitles}} and captions {{are produced}} primarily with the deaf and {{hard of hearing}} in mind, many hearing film and television viewers choose to use them. This is often done because the presence of closed captioning and subtitles ensures that not <b>one</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> dialogue will be missed. Bars and other noisy public places, where film dialogue would otherwise be drowned out, often make closed captions visible for patrons. Viewers may also find thick regional accents from other same-language countries hard to understand without subtitles. Films and television shows often have subtitles displayed in the same language if the speaker has a speech impairment. In addition, captions may reveal information {{that would otherwise be}} difficult to obtain from hearing. Some examples would be song lyrics, dialog spoken quietly or by those with accents unfamiliar to the intended audience, or supportive, minor dialog from background characters. It is argued that such additional information and detail enhances the overall experience and allows the viewer a better grasp of the material. Furthermore, people learning a foreign language may sometimes use same-language subtitles to better understand the dialog without having to resort to a translation.|$|E
500|$|On {{researching the}} history of UCL's Egyptology department, the {{historian}} Rosalind M. Janssen stated that Murray was [...] "remembered with gratitude and immense affection by all her former students. A wise and witty teacher, two generations of Egyptologists have forever been in her debt." [...] Alongside teaching them, Murray was known to socialise with her UCL students outside of class hours. The archaeologist Ralph Merrifield, who knew Murray through the Folklore Society, described her as a [...] "diminutive and kindly scholar, who radiated intelligence and strength of character into extreme old age". Davidson, who also knew Murray through the Society, noted that at their meetings [...] "she would sit near the front, a bent and seemingly guileless old lady dozing peacefully, {{and then in the}} middle of a discussion would suddenly intervene with a relevant and penetrating comment which showed that she had missed not <b>one</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> the argument". The later folklorist Juliette Wood noted that many members of the Folklore Society [...] "remember her fondly", adding that Murray had been [...] "especially keen to encourage younger researchers, even those who disagreed with her ideas".|$|E

He said that the Obama administration lies systematically, and that American media outlets are reluctant to challenge the administration, saying [...] "It's pathetic, they are more than obsequious, they are afraid to pick on this guy [...] ". Hersh later clarified that he didn't dispute Bin Laden's death in Pakistan, and rather meant that the lying began in the aftermath of bin Laden's death.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2007, Burroughs and his publisher, St. Martin's Press, {{settled with}} the Turcotte family, who {{stated that they}} were the basis for the Finch family portrayed in Running with Scissors. The Turcottes, who alleged that Running with Scissors was largely fictional and written in a sensational manner, sought damages of $2 million for {{invasion}} of privacy, defamation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Burroughs defended his work as [...] "entirely accurate," [...] but agreed to call the work a [...] "book" [...] (instead of [...] "memoir") in the author's note, to alter the acknowledgments page in future editions to recognize the Turcotte family's conflicting memories of described events, and express regret for [...] "any unintentional harm" [...] to the Turcotte family. Burroughs felt vindicated by the settlement. [...] "I'm not at all sorry that I wrote it. And you know, the suit settled – it settled in my favor. I didn't change a word of the memoir, not <b>one</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> it. It's still a memoir, it's marketed as a memoir, [...] agreed one hundred percent that it is a memoir." ...|$|E

Accept evolution with its fossils and elementary species, its scientific doctrine of natural causes. And still you are confronted with the same mystery, primary and profound. Ex nihilo nihil, as the Latin tag of our schooldays has it: nothing can come of nothing." [...] This was brought home to him in London, where in his spare time he had organised a working boys' club. One day he invited a distinguished zoologist to deliver a lecture to the members. The speaker, adopting [...] "a frankly atheistic approach," [...] described the sequence of events leading to the emergence, [...] "though he did not say how," [...] of the first primitive life-form from lifeless matter. When he concluded, there was polite applause. Then, [...] "a mild and very average youngster rose nervously to his feet," [...] and with a slight stammer asked how there came to be anything in the first place. The naïve question took everyone by surprise. The lecturer [...] "looked annoyed, hesitated, slowly turned red. Then, before he could answer, the whole club burst into a howl of laughter. The elaborate structure of logic offered by the test-tube realist had been crumpled by <b>one</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> challenge from a simple-minded boy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Writing {{began in}} December 1976, with a first draft {{completed}} by mid-1977. The final pre-production draft was ready in January 1978, following [...] "a concentrated two-week writing and water-skiing period in Barbados". The film {{would not have}} been made without Python fan former Beatle George Harrison, who set up HandMade Films to help fund it at a cost of £3million. Harrison put up the money for it as he [...] "wanted to see the movie" [...] (this was later described by Terry Jones as the [...] "world's most expensive cinema ticket"). The original backers, EMI Films, had been scared off at the last minute by the subject matter, particularly Bernard Delfont. The very last words in the film are: [...] "I said to him, 'Bernie, they'll never make their money back on this one'", teasing Delfont for his lack of faith in the project. Terry Gilliam later said, [...] "They pulled out on the Thursday. The crew was supposed to be leaving on the Saturday. Disastrous. It was because they read the script ... finally." [...] As a reward for his help, Harrison appears in a cameo appearance as Mr. Papadopoulos, [...] "owner of the Mount", who briefly shakes hands with Brian in a crowd scene (at 1:09 in the film). His <b>one</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> dialogue (a cheery but out of place Scouse [...] "'ullo") had to be dubbed in later.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to do an episode about Anne Frank, Murphy said, [...] "We have a great writing staff but I will take credit for that. One of the things we've done on the show is we take historical figures – {{last year was the}} Black Dahlia and this year is Anne Frank. The Black Dahlia particularly was a case that was never solved so we solved that case in our way. The Anne Frank thing was always interesting to me because after the war, much like the Anastasia case, there were many women who came forward after that diary and said, 'Well I'm the real Anne Frank,' and they were struck down. Many of them were found to be mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, so I read about those cases. Before we even wrote <b>one</b> <b>word</b> <b>of</b> it, I thought there was sort of only one actress I was interested in playing Anne Frank and that was Franka. So I brought her in and said, 'I'm gonna write this for you and would you do it.' And we had no script because we were very early on in the season. She loved the story and I sorta swore her to secrecy and God bless her heart she had like five months without telling anybody. I love how it came together." ...|$|E
