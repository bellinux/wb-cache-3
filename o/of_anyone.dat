The essays span {{a wide range of}} genres, including elegies for activists and scholars who died of AIDS, performance pieces, and academic essays on topics such as sado-masochism, poetics and masturbation. In Tendencies, Sedgwick first publicly embraces the word 'queer,' defining it as: [...] "the open mesh of possibilites, gaps, overlaps, dissonances and resonances, lapses and excesses of meaning when the constituent elements <b>of</b> <b>anyone's</b> gender, <b>of</b> <b>anyone's</b> sexuality aren't made (or can't be made) to signify monolithically." ...|$|R

5|$|Five {{important}} Upanishad texts, {{according to}} Olivelle – the Jabala plus the Aruni, Laghu-Samnyasa, Kathashruti and Paramahamsa Upanishads – provide different {{answers to the}} question of when someone may renounce the worldly life to lead a monastic one. The Laghu-Samnyasa Upanishad, Kathashruti Upanishad and Paramahamsa Upanishad suggest that a man may renounce after sequentially completing the student, householder and retirement stages of life, and then getting the consent of his elders and direct family members. In contrast, the Jabala Upanishad and Aruni Upanishad assert that the choice is entirely up to the individual, without needing to have completed any stage of life nor requiring the consent <b>of</b> <b>anyone</b> else.|$|E

5|$|Initially {{the camps}} housed {{political}} opponents; over time, undesirable members of German society—criminals, vagrants, deviants—were {{placed in the}} camps as well.

This included Jews, Gypsies, communists, and those persons of any other cultural, racial, political, or religious affiliation deemed by the Nazis to be Untermensch (sub-human).
