2500|$|There was {{speculation}} in {{the media}} on whether the AFL football game at Subiaco Oval on 21 June between the West Coast Eagles and Geelong Football Club should be moved from night to daytime, to avoid using the oval's lights. According to Western Power, the electricity used by the oval's lights for four hours of operation could power more than 1,300 homes, but a spokesperson from the Office of Energy said, [...] "Effectively {{the amount of energy}} used to light a game at night is less than what would be used if those thousands of people were at home with lights and other services operating". Western Australian Trotting Association chief executive, Rob Bovell, said if they were forced to move races at Gloucester Park from night to day, they would [...] "probably lose half a million dollars in turnover and our customers would drop by 70 percent. Clearly this would cause major damage to us financially because <b>our</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> set up to race at night time. However if we are using energy that is affecting emergency services we will close down tomorrow." ...|$|E

60|$|In a word, {{they saw}} plainly {{there was nothing}} to be done where we were without shipping; that if <b>our</b> <b>business</b> indeed <b>was</b> only to eat and drink, we could not find a better place in the world; but if <b>our</b> <b>business</b> <b>was</b> to get away, and get home into our country, we could not find a worse.|$|R
60|$|To this I answered, that I {{conceived}} <b>our</b> <b>business</b> <b>was</b> not {{to attempt}} our escape in a canoe, but that, {{as there were}} other vessels at sea besides our ship, {{and that there were}} few nations that lived on the sea-shore that were so barbarous, but that they went to sea in some boats or other, <b>our</b> <b>business</b> <b>was</b> to cruise along the coast of the island, which was very long, and to seize upon the first we could get that was better than our own, and so from that to another, till perhaps we might at last get a good ship to carry us wherever we pleased to go.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no. <b>Our</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> not fighting. If we are attacked, {{of course}} we defend ourselves; but we don't go a foot out of our way, if we can help it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Fulmort of St. Matthew's is poor {{because he}} gave all to St. Matthew's,' said Phoebe; 'but <b>our</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> {{not a small}} one, and the {{property}} {{in the country is}} large.' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{with this}} {{we have nothing}} at present to do. <b>Our</b> <b>business</b> <b>is,</b> in spirit, to follow Hendrick and his friends through that wilderness, as {{it was at the}} {{beginning}} of the sixteenth century.|$|E

6000|$|... "There is {{a feeling}} of justice in what you say, Jaap, but the {{community}} cannot get on in anything like safety unless we let the law rule. <b>Our</b> <b>business</b> <b>was</b> to take those squatters, and to hand {{them over to the}} law." ...|$|R

6000|$|Kemp nodded. [...] "Well, perhaps there's no use {{in talking}} about the lamp. <b>Our</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> to make good, using the tools we've got. All the same, if they want a man somewhere else, I guess I'd {{recommend}} Willis." ...|$|E

6000|$|CHR. Now Christiana, imagining {{what they}} should mean, made answer again, [...] "We will neither hear nor regard, nor yield to what you shall ask. We are in haste, and cannot stay; <b>our</b> <b>{{business}}</b> <b>is</b> a business of life or death." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I have a favour {{to ask of}} you, Monsieur de Marsac," [...] said I, rising; for <b>our</b> <b>business</b> <b>was</b> at an end. [...] "It is that if {{you should}} have an {{opportunity}} of communicating with Mademoiselle de Lavedan, you will let her know that I am not--not the Lesperon that is betrothed to your sister." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that rather}} depends," [...] Laverick answered. [...] "We {{certainly}} had a terribly anxious time yesterday. <b>Our</b> <b>business</b> has <b>been</b> most unfortunate--" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I'm afraid I can't agree," [...] he replied. [...] "We have {{a pretty}} good agent at all the ports where we trade, and Wyndham sent a man he was {{satisfied}} about to the lagoon. <b>Our</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> not large enough to justify our taking a new partner." ...|$|E

60|$|By {{setting down}} so much when <b>our</b> <b>business</b> <b>was</b> concluded, {{it would appear}} as if we loafed {{on the deck of}} the ship some time, whereas we were given to {{understand}} that our room was better than our company immediately the transaction was completed, and in a very few seconds after the officers allowed Jerry and I to cease the labor of shucking, we were aboard the Avenger, getting under way.|$|R
60|$|This was the {{foundation}} I ever acted upon with {{relation to the}} peace.

60|$|Spain, Portugal, France, as nations, and {{the great}} company of the Jesuits as one mighty brotherhood, were the {{foremost}} in the great undertaking; but their doings form a history of their own, and <b>our</b> <b>business</b> <b>is</b> with the efforts of our own Church and country in the same great cause.|$|E
