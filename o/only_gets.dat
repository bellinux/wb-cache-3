25|$|The {{northern}} Atlantic coast has warm summers (28°C to 32°C, {{but with}} relatively cool nights at 15°C) and mild winters, with highs of about 12°C and lows about 2–3°C. Occasionally, temperatures reach −10°C or 40°C, and rainfall is very scarce. It <b>only</b> <b>gets</b> a bit colder further south in Chubut, {{and the city}} of Comodoro Rivadavia has summer temperatures of 24°C to 28°C, nights of 12°C to 16°C, and winters with days around 10°C and nights around 3°C, and less than 250mm of rain. However, there is a drastic drop as we move south to Santa Cruz: Rio Gallegos, in the south of the province, has summer temps of 17°C to 21°C, (nights between 6°C and 10°C) and winter temperatures of 2°C to 6°C, with nights between −5°C and 0°C despite being right on the coast. Snowfall is common despite the dryness, and temperatures are known to fall to under −18°C and to remain below freezing for several days in a row. Rio Gallegos is also among the windiest places on Earth, with winds reaching 100km h occasionally.|$|E
25|$|Viticulture is most {{commonly}} found in Mediterranean, continental and maritime climates with each unique climate providing its own challenges in providing sufficient water at critical times during the growing season. In Mediterranean climates irrigation is usually needed during the very dry periods of the summer ripening stages where drought can be a persistent threat. The level of humidity in a particular macroclimate will dictate exactly how much irrigation is needed {{with high levels of}} evapotranspiration more commonly occurring in Mediterranean climates that have low levels of humidity such as part of Chile and the Cape Province of South Africa. In these low humidity regions, primary irrigation may be needed, but in many Mediterranean climates the irrigation is usually supplemental. The amount of precipitation that occurs during spring and summer months is also important. For example, Tuscany receives an average of 8inches (200mm) of rainfall during the months of April through June - the period that includes flowering and fruit set, when the water is most crucial. While fluctuations in rainfall do occur, the amount of natural precipitation, combined with water holding capacity of soil, is typically sufficient to result in healthy harvest. In contrast, Napa Valley <b>only</b> <b>gets</b> 2.4inches (60mm), on average, during the same period of time, often in an erratic pattern (some years seeing more, some years seeing only trace amounts of rain), and most appellations in Central and Southern California (both along the coast and inland) receive even less than that, necessitating supplemental irrigation.|$|E

500|$|Zosimus had {{no great}} respect for Philip, and offers an {{unfavorable}} judgment on his reign. Nonetheless, he offers a curiously detailed narrative of his reign. [...] He devotes five sections of his Historia Nova to the emperor (1.18–22)—more than Alexander Severus, who <b>only</b> <b>gets</b> half a section (1.8). He even reverts to Philip {{in the midst of}} a discussion of the Peace of Jovian (363) two books later (at 3.32), taking the opportunity to recall Philip's own [...] "disgraceful" [...] peace with the Persians. In Shahîd's judgment, Zosimus makes this editorial decision to emphasize his central theme—the decline and [...] "barbarization" [...] of Rome. Zosimus' views on the latter phenomenon reflect his racial prejudice, and his account of Philip carries anti-Semitic overtones. In Zosimus' view, Philip was a barbarian operating at the highest levels of power. The unsavory character of Philip is contrasted with his ethnically Roman predecessor, Gordian (who Philip helped overthrow), and his Roman successor, Decius, who wins glowing praise from the historian.|$|E
