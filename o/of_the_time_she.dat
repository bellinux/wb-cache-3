5|$|In 1914, Petrie {{launched}} the academic journal Ancient Egypt, published {{through his own}} British School of Archaeology in Egypt (BSAE), which was based at UCL. Given that he was often away from London excavating in Egypt, Murray was left to operate as de facto editor much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>She</b> also published many research articles in the journal and authored many of its book reviews, particularly of the German-language publications which Petrie could not read.|$|E

She only spent 54 days at sea during her 937 days in service and made only a single, two-day, trip to Pag Island. Only 5.7% of her life was spent at sea; for the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> swung at anchor in Pola Harbour. She was never even drydocked to get her bottom cleaned.|$|E
5|$|Elsa, {{princess of}} Arendelle and heiress to the throne, is {{born with the}} ability to create and control ice and snow. As a child, she uses her {{abilities}} to create a winter wonderland to play in with her younger sister and best friend, Princess Anna. One night, Elsa accidentally harms Anna with her powers. The king and queen of Arendelle hurriedly take Anna to a tribe of mountain trolls to be healed. While healing Anna, the trolls inform the royals present that Elsa's abilities will grow, becoming both beautiful and very dangerous so she must learn to control them. While the trolls erase Anna's memory of the incident and of her elder sister's powers in general, Elsa is traumatized by the event. The king and queen take steps to control and hide Elsa's ice powers: the castle gates are locked, Elsa is shut away in her bedroom for most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> is given gloves to help suppress her powers and is told to hold in her emotions as well. Nonetheless her powers continue to grow even stronger and so she becomes fearful of harming those she cares about most. Meanwhile, her sister Anna is less happy and confused by the loss of contact with her elder sister and tries, without success, to coax her out of her room. When the sisters grow into teenagers, the ship in which the king and queen are sailing is capsized in a storm and they drown, leaving Anna and Elsa feeling even more lonely.|$|E
2500|$|Polly's {{family was}} not fabulously rich, {{but her father}} had been raised, as she put it, [...] "to ride to hounds, sail boats, and lead cotillions", and he lived high. In 1914, she was {{presented}} to <b>the</b> King <b>of</b> England at a garden party. And in keeping with the American aristocratic style <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times,</b> <b>she</b> was even photographed as a child by Charles Dana Gibson.|$|R

25|$|Polly's new {{undergarment}} complemented the new fashions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>She</b> was mobbed {{after the}} dance by other girls {{who wanted to}} know how she moved so freely, and when she showed her new garment to friends the next day, they all wanted one. One day, she received a request for one of her contraptions from a stranger, who offered a dollar for her efforts. She knew then that this could become a viable business.|$|E
500|$|She has [...] "lost count" [...] <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>she</b> {{has been}} {{physically}} attacked by activists. In Paris in October 2005, she {{was hit with}} a tofu pie while waiting to get into the Chloé show. On another occasion, an activist dumped a dead raccoon on her plate at a restaurant; she told the waiter to remove it. She and Vogue publisher Ron Galotti once retaliated for a protest outside the Condé Nast offices during the company's annual Christmas party by sending down a plate of roast beef.|$|R

25|$|In {{her first}} season between Liverpool and Douglas, her average {{time between the}} Bar Lightship and the Head was 2 hours 24 minutes. A year later she reduced this average by one minute. However, her {{sustained}} high speeds came at a considerable cost. She used 95 tons of coal in one day's steaming, and these high running costs resulted in her appearing on station only during the peak periods of the summer months; during the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> was invariably laid up.|$|E
25|$|While {{posted to}} the United Nations in New York City, Sharaf {{returned}} to Egypt in February 1959 to marry Noha Elwi (née Wadoud Wagdy Elwi); {{it was an}} arranged marriage, typical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>She</b> was the second daughter of Wagdy Elwi, a bureaucrat at the Egyptian Ministry of Justice, and a great-grandson of Elwi Pasha, personal ophthalmologist to the Khedive of Egypt. Her mother Samia Rostom {{was the daughter of}} second-generation immigrants from Turkey, and the niece of the Egyptian silver screen star of the Forties and Fifties, Zaki Rostom. The marriage produced three children.|$|E
25|$|The first {{victim was}} her tutor, who carried the letters between them.

Two of the brothers escaped to France but they soon returned with the evident intention of concluding their revenge against Diego who, fearing for his life, hired a bodyguard. The three assassins, {{with the help of}} two uncles and probably fuelled by hatred against Spaniards, killed him in the woods near Noja (today known as Noepoli) several months later.|$|E
50|$|Allegheny was {{somewhat}} {{different from other}} gunboats <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> as <b>she</b> was propelled by two eight-bladed horizontal wheels invented by Lieutenant William W.

50|$|Her friends, and {{especially}} her poorer neighbours, knew both {{the strength and}} <b>the</b> winning charm <b>of</b> her character.

She had an inventive mind and a ready pen, and a bare list <b>of</b> <b>the</b> books written or edited by her would probably occupy nearly a whole column <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Times.</b> <b>She</b> wrote chiefly for young people, especially young girls, and her books are the result not only of a strong ethical purpose, but also of her firm devotion to the High Church view of Christian doctrine and practice.|$|R

25|$|Sometimes, a queen {{or another}} female will eat eggs laid {{in her own}} colony. The {{majority}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she</b> eats the eggs of her subordinates, however, a female may occasionally eat her own eggs. Queens also undertake egg inspections {{to see if the}} eggs in the nest are their own or if they were laid by a subordinate. The majority of oophagies are committed by the queen (87.5%). Oviposition is the laying of eggs. Queens lay 83.3% of the eggs in pre-emergence colonies, which is a significantly higher rate of oviposition than that of subordinates. Workers were never observed eating or laying eggs.|$|E
25|$|Germaine Dulac {{was born}} in Amiens, France into an upper-middle-class family of a career {{military}} officer. Since her father's job required the family to frequently move between small garrison towns, Germaine was sent {{to live with her}} grandmother in Paris. She soon became interested in art and studied music, painting, and theater. Following the death of her parents, Dulac moved to Paris and combined her growing interests in socialism and feminism with a career in journalism. In 1905 she married Louis-Albert Dulac, an agricultural engineer who also came from an upper-class family. Four years later she began writing for La Française, a feminist magazine edited by Jane Misme where she eventually became the drama critic. Dulac also found time to work on the editorial staff of La Fronde, a radical feminist journal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>She</b> also began to pursue her interest in still photography, which preceded her initial entry into filmmaking. Dulac and her husband divorced in 1920.|$|E
25|$|Pierre-Yves Gayraud, the film's costume designer, spent fifteen weeks researching 18th century fashion. Production of over 1,400 costumes, in {{addition}} to the preparation of shoes, hats and other accessories were completed within three months by workshops in and around Bucharest in Romania. The costume department had to make the clothing look worn and dirty. Additionally, the actors were required to wear the costumes and more or less live in them prior to shooting. The character Grenouille was not given any white clothing and wore bluish over-garments throughout most of the film because the filmmakers wanted to depict him as a shadow and a chameleon. Instead of dressing the character of Laura in the colorful regional dress that was the tradition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> was dressed in the less vivid tones of a Parisian damsel to highlight her social aspirations as well as her red hair.|$|E
50|$|After Louis VI's death, Adélaide did not {{immediately}} retire to conventual life, as did most widowed queens <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> Instead <b>she</b> married Matthieu I of Montmorency, {{with whom she had}} one child.

50|$|As {{a natural}} progression, Cook-Parrish moved from {{speaking}} to writing {{and was able}} to get her ideas and words out to many more people. Just as she spoke on many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> important issues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times,</b> <b>she</b> wrote about gaining a better education system for females and African Americans, public reform, <b>the</b> significance <b>of</b> receiving a Christian education, and equality in all areas of society.

She also wrote articles for Hope, a missionary magazine that provided important communication to black women activists who attended the Black Baptist women's state conventions.|$|R
25|$|She {{attended}} Mark Twain Elementary School, O.W. Holmes Middle School, and Wheeling High School. While in high school, Reinhart {{was first}} introduced to Jazz music after becoming {{a part of the}} school's vocal group called Midnight Blues. She eventually performed at the 2009 Montreux Jazz Festival and Umbria Jazz Festival with her high school's jazz band, of which she was the first ever permanent singer. She reunited with the jazz band in 2015 when the director invited her to sing in their show at The Midwest Clinic located at McCormick Place - West, south of downtown Chicago. After graduating from high school in 2009, Reinhart attended Harper College in Palatine, Illinois from 2009 to 2010, where she studied jazz as a full-time student. She performed with the college's Jazz Ensemble and Jazz Lab. These events during her late education allowed her to gain experience singing Cole Porter standards in such historic places as Switzerland and Italy. Reinhart also fronted a band during college under such tentative names as Haley's Comet and Reinhart & the Rastatutes; the band covered classic rock songs from Led Zeppelin and other famous artists <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>She</b> worked as a lifeguard at the Family Aquatic Center, a waterpark at the Wheeling Park District, for four years prior to auditioning for American Idol.|$|E
500|$|Although Lenore {{had been}} more {{independent}} than many women <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> later stated that she [...] "never had any regrets about giving up movies."

It was never either and; it was always either or." [...] George would later consider his successful seven-year courtship of her to be his greatest sales achievement.|$|E
500|$|In January1963, Plath {{spoke with}} Dr.John Horder, her GP {{and a close}} friend who lived near her.

25|$|Todd argues that, in {{addition}} to patriarchal prejudice, Behn suffered for her dismissal of any liberal agenda. Going against <b>the</b> tide <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>times,</b> <b>she</b> believed in <b>the</b> divine right <b>of</b> kings and aristocratic hierarchies. Todd writes that Behn was contemptuous <b>of</b> democracy and <b>the</b> common man in the street, not expressly interested in human rights — for women or slaves or anyone else — and that, {{because she did not}} support any kind of a liberal agenda, her causes were not cheered by the progressives. She does not easily fit into any mould of proto-feminism. She had come into adulthood, following the English Civil War, under the harsh puritan rule <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Restoration, and regarded political populism as a sign of moral collapse and <b>the</b> triumph <b>of</b> venality.|$|R
500|$|When {{accessing}} the very deep emotions {{called for by}} her character, Mulligan stated, [...] "I really took my cue from the book". She noted that her role did not require her to have much to say, because Kathy {{was more of an}} observer throughout most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film. She recalled that [...] "every time I was in a scene where I wasn’t quite sure where I was going with it, I would go to the book and read through the lines because she's unreliable, in that much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>she's</b> not being truly honest with herself or the audience." [...] The young actress said that her friendship with Knightley made their scenes together easier because they would both regard each other's comments helpful and would not feel [...] "insulted or hurt" [...] in discussion.|$|R

500|$|Anna Pickard of The Guardian took a {{different}} opinion choosing to focus on how Cole appeared to be [...] "making up {{for the lack of}} having Girls Aloud around her by pretending to be all of them at once" [...] and anguish of her own marriage issues. She noted that Cole's various outfits appear to distract people from the lyrics of the song which [...] "seem to be, a thinly veiled reflection on her own marriage compounded by the sad mooning face she keeps pulling. [...] singing a solo song about one's troubled (though reconciled and apparently happy) marriage. Although sometimes she looks cross instead. And quite a lot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> <b>she</b> looks like she's her own evil sexy twin." ...|$|E
2500|$|Margaret {{began using}} the name [...] "Peggy" [...] at Washington Seminary, and the {{abbreviated}} form [...] "Peg" [...] at Smith College when she found an icon for herself in the mythological winged horse, [...] "Pegasus", that inspires poets.

[...] At a 1921 Atlanta debutante charity ball, she performed an Apache dance. The dance included a kiss with her male partner that shocked Atlanta [...] "high society". The Apache and the Tango were scandalous dances for their elements <b>of</b> eroticism, <b>the</b> latter popularized in a 1921 silent film, <b>The</b> Four Horsemen <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Apocalypse, that made its lead actor, Rudolph Valentino, a sex symbol {{for his ability to}} Tango.|$|R
