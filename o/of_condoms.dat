5|$|Many Western Catholics have voiced {{significant}} {{disagreement with}} the Church's teaching on contraception. Catholics for Choice, a political lobbyist group which is not associated with the Catholic Church, stated in 1998 that 96% of U.S. Catholic women had used contraceptives {{at some point in}} their lives and that 72% of Catholics believed that one could be a good Catholic without obeying the Church's teaching on birth control. Use of natural family planning methods among United States Catholics purportedly is low, although the number cannot be known with certainty. As Catholic health providers are among the largest providers of services to patients with HIV/AIDS worldwide, there is significant controversy within and outside the church regarding the use <b>of</b> <b>condoms</b> as a means of limiting new infections, as condom use ordinarily constitutes prohibited contraceptive use.|$|E
5|$|Two {{important}} legal {{decisions in}} the 1930s helped increase the accessibility of contraceptives. In 1930, two condom manufacturers sued {{each other in the}} Youngs Rubber case, and the judge ruled that contraceptive manufacturing was a legitimate business enterprise. He went further, and declared that the federal law prohibiting the mailing <b>of</b> <b>condoms</b> was not legally sound. Sanger precipitated a second legal breakthrough when she ordered a diaphragm from Japan in 1932, hoping to provoke a decisive battle in the courts. The diaphragm was confiscated by the U.S. government, and Sanger's subsequent legal challenge led to the 1936 One Package legal ruling by Judge Augustus Hand. His decision overturned an important provision of the anti-contraception laws that prohibited physicians from obtaining contraceptives.Rose, Melody, Abortion: A Documentary and Reference Guide, ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 29.Tone, p. 178: Tone calls the ruling a coup d'etat for Sanger. This court victory motivated the American Medical Association in 1937 to finally adopt contraception as a normal medical service and a core component of medical school curricula.. Retrieved 15 October 2011. However, the medical community was slow to accept this new responsibility, and women continued to rely on unsafe and ineffective contraceptive advice from ill-informed sources until the 1960s.|$|E

40|$|The National Family Planning Programme of India had {{introduced}} <b>condom</b> as one <b>of</b> the family planning methods {{in the late}} 1960 s. Condom was promoted as a family planning method through social marketing since its inception. With the increasing prevalence and incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV/AIDS, condom was also promoted as a dual method for protection against both unintended pregnancies as well as sexually transmitted infections. Despite efforts at various levels, the overall use <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> among couples in India is low.

40|$|HIV {{prevalence}} in Nigeria {{is increasing}} rapidly. Increased condom use {{is the most}} viable solution to slow down or reverse this trend. This paper uses data from two waves of a nationwide survey of over 5000 respondents each to examine factors that influence consistency <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> use with various types of partner. The results show that while the overall level <b>of</b> consistent <b>condom</b> use has remained low, reported consistent condom use with occasional partners and commercial sex workers exceeds 60 %. There is also some evidence of an increasing trend in consistent condom use. The most important factors affecting consistency <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> use include awareness of the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> {{for the prevention of}} HIV and unwanted pregnancy, and concerns about unwanted pregnancy and HIV. Concern about unwanted pregnancy has a strong effect on consistency <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> use with stable partners, while concern about HIV infection has a strong effect on consistency <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> use with nonstable partners. The results suggest that HIV prevention programs need to do more than provide education about the modes of transmission and the ways to prevent infection. Improving the effectiveness of HIV prevention program is likely to require focusing more explicitly on people's personal risk perception, and condom efficacy. Focusing on these topics may further accelerate the observed positive trend in condom use...|$|R

40|$|Background: HIV {{infection}} {{related to}} commercial sexual contact {{is a serious}} public health issue in China. The objectives {{of the present study}} are to explore the predictors <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> use among female sex workers (FSWs) in China and examine the relationship between Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs. Methodology/Principal Findings: A cross-sectional study was conducted in two cities (Wuhan and Suizhou) in Hubei Province, China, between July 2009 and June 2010. A total of 427 FSWs were recruited through mediators from the â€˜low-tierâ€™ entertainment establishments. Data were obtained by self-administered questionnaires. Structural equation models were constructed to examine the association. We collected 363 valid questionnaires. Within the context of HBM, perceived severity of HIV mediated through perceived benefits <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> use had a weak effect on condom use (r = 0. 07). Perceived benefits and perceived barriers were proximate determinants <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> use (r = 0. 23 and r= 20. 62, respectively). Self-efficacy had a direct effect on perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers, which was indirectly associated with condom use behaviors (r = 0. 36). Conclusions/Significance: The HBM provides a useful framework for investigating predictors <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> use behaviors among FSWs.

25|$|More {{attention}} {{was brought to}} quality issues in the 1930s. In 1935, a biochemist tested 2000 condoms by filling each one with air and then water: he found that 60% of them leaked. The condom industry estimated that only 25% <b>of</b> <b>condoms</b> were tested for quality before packaging. The media attention led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to classify condoms as a drug in 1937 and mandate that every condom be tested before packaging. Youngs Rubber Company {{was the first to}} institute quality testing of every condom they made, installing automatic testing equipment designed by Arthur Youngs (the owner's brother) in 1938. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act authorized the FDA to seize defective products; the first month the Act took effect in 1940, the FDA seized 864,000 condoms. While these actions improved the quality <b>of</b> <b>condoms</b> in the United States, American condom manufacturers continued to export their rejects for sale in foreign markets.|$|E

40|$|Sexual {{offenders}} are increasingly reported {{to use condoms}} while committing the crime, mainly to prevent the transfer of DNA evidence. Although condoms are often removed from the crime scene, vaginal swabs can be taken from the victim to prove the presence <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> lubricants and therefore evidence of corpus delicti. However, late reporting {{to the police and}} the tendency of the victim to wash immediately after the crime, may compromise the detection <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> lubricants. Recently we showed that Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation MS Imaging (MALDI MSI) <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> contaminated fingermarks enables images of the fingermark ridge pattern to be obtained simultaneously with the detection <b>of</b> the <b>condom</b> lubricant for two condom brands, thus becoming a potential alternative way to link the assailant to the crime. Building on the value of this information, it would be advantageous to identify the condom brand used during the sexual assault. Here we show the development of a multidisciplinary spectroscopic approach, including MALDI MSI, MS/MS, Raman microscopy and ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, applied to a range <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> brands/types. The techniques have complementary features and provide complementary information to retrieve a "condom brand spectroscopic fingerprint". Unique spectroscopic profiles would greatly aid in the screening and identification <b>of</b> the <b>condom,</b> thus adding intelligence to the case under investigation...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examined}} {{the applicability of the}} Theory of Reasoned Action to the study <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> use intentions <b>of</b> students at a university in southern Ghana. The data supported the model, explaining 33 % of the variance in students' condom use intentions. Subjective norms and the perceived disadvantages <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> use were significant determinants of intention, with the former being more important. Respondents who intended to use condoms consistently ("intenders") and those with no such intentions ("non-intenders") were equally motivated to comply with the wishes of their significant referents (sexual partners, close friends, parents and medical doctors). The critical difference was that "intenders" consistently held a stronger belief than "non-intenders" that their significant referents approved <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> use. Significantly, whereas "intenders" believed that their sexual partners would approve <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> use, the "non-intenders" held the contrary belief that their partners would disapprove of such behavior. This suggests that AIDS education interventions targeting a similar audience like the university students in this study should shift their foci away from individuals alone and instead, focus simultaneously on individuals, their sexual partners and their broader social networks in order to enhance perceptions of peer acceptance <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> use.
