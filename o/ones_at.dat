5|$|Despite the accident, a {{pre-production}} {{batch of}} ten aircraft was ordered on 27 July 1945 {{as it was}} felt that mixed-power aircraft would be of some use easing the transition of pilots from piston-engine fighters to jet-engined <b>ones.</b> <b>At</b> the same time Sukhoi's Su-5 was cancelled as it was judged inferior to the I-250.|$|E
5|$|At certain dates, food may be set {{out as a}} {{sacrifice}} to {{the spirits of the}} deceased or the gods, such as during the Qingming Festival. This may include slaughtered animals, such as pigs and ducks, or fruit. Another form of sacrifice involves the burning of Joss paper, or Hell Bank Notes, on the assumption that images thus consumed by the fire will reappear—not as a mere image, but as the actual item—in the spirit world, making them available for revered ancestors and departed loved <b>ones.</b> <b>At</b> other points, a vegan diet or full fast may be observed.|$|E

5|$|C. Rajagopalachari, a close {{associate}} of Gandhi, led the march which had close to 150 volunteers, {{most of whom}} belonged to the Indian National Congress. It began at Trichinopoly (now Tiruchirappalli) on 13 April 1930 and proceeded for about 150 miles towards the east before culminating at Vedaranyam, a small coastal town in the then Tanjore District. By collecting salt directly from the sea the marchers broke the salt law. As {{a part of the}} march, Rajagopalachari created awareness among the people by highlighting the importance of khādī as well as social issues like caste discrimination. The campaign came to an end on 28 April 1930 when the participants were arrested by the police. Its leader Rajagopalachari was imprisoned for six months. The march along with the <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> Dandi and Dharasana drew worldwide attention to the Indian independence movement.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's away colours {{are usually}} all yellow or all white with blue trim. More recently, the club {{have had a}} number of black or dark blue away kits. As with most teams, they have also had some more unusual <b>ones.</b> <b>At</b> Docherty's behest, in the 1966 FA Cup semi-final they wore blue and black stripes, based on Inter Milan's kit. In the mid-1970s, the away strip was a red, white and green kit {{inspired}} by the Hungarian national side of the 1950s. Other memorable away kits include an all jade strip worn from 1986–89, red and white diamonds from 1990–92, graphite and tangerine from 1994–96, and luminous yellow from 2007–08. The graphite and tangerine strip often appears in lists of the worst football kits ever.|$|E
5|$|Reproduction in giraffes is broadly polygamous: a few older males {{mate with}} the fertile females. Male giraffes assess female {{fertility}} by tasting the female's urine to detect oestrus, in a multi-step {{process known as}} the flehmen response. Males prefer young adult females over juveniles and older adults. Once an oestrous female is detected, the male will attempt to court her. When courting, dominant males will keep subordinate <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> bay. A courting male may lick a female's tail, rest his head and neck on her body or nudge her with his horns. During copulation, the male stands on his hind legs with his head held up and his front legs resting on the female's sides.|$|E

5|$|Superman the Ride has {{undergone}} numerous safety upgrades. After the 2001 incident, the PVC airlines were replaced with steel reinforced air hoses {{to prevent a}} similar accident from occurring. After the 2004 incident, metal bars were installed {{on both sides of}} the “T-bar” restraint, encasing the rider's legs. Shin restraints were added to the lower portion of the restraint, preventing riders’ feet from leaving the car. In addition, all of the seat belts on both 36-passenger trains were replaced with <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> a consistent length, as well as a “go or no go” belt for each seat and “T-bar” restraint. The “go or no go” belt ensured the “T-bar” restraint was in an effective position before leaving the station. During the 2009 rebranding, new trains were deployed with new restraints added. The new lapbars eliminated the center pole, leaving only the exterior poles. New seat belts provided more strength and were less likely to come undone unintentionally.|$|E
5|$|The Merced River and {{its tributaries}} are a popular {{recreational}} area {{in part because of}} Yosemite National Park. There are many activities within the watershed, including boating, fishing, camping and hiking. Whitewater rafting is permitted throughout Merced River Canyon from the downstream half of Yosemite Valley to the entrance of Lake McClure. The most difficult rapids in this segment rate Class III and Class IV, mostly upstream of El Portal. There is also boating on Lake McClure. Camping throughout the upper Merced watershed is generally only permitted in designated campgrounds. Campgrounds along the Merced River {{and its tributaries}} include <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> Railroad Flat, McCabe Flat, Willow Placer, Merced Lake, Vogelsang Lake, Sunrise Creek, May Lake, Bridalveil Creek, and a ski hut at Ostrander Lake, the source of Bridalveil Creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of military camouflage {{was driven by}} the increasing range and accuracy of infantry firearms in the 19th century. In particular {{the replacement of the}} inaccurate musket with weapons such as the Baker rifle made personal concealment in battle essential. Two Napoleonic War skirmishing units of the British Army, the 95th Rifle Regiment and the 60th Rifle Regiment, were the first to adopt camouflage {{in the form of a}} rifle green jacket, while the Line regiments continued to wear scarlet tunics. A contemporary study in 1800 by the English artist and soldier Charles Hamilton Smith provided evidence that grey uniforms were less visible than green <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> a range of 150 yards.|$|E

5|$|The silver penny {{was almost}} the only coin used in middle and later Anglo-Saxon England. Æthelwulf's coinage came from a main mint in Canterbury and a {{secondary}} one at Rochester; both had been used by Egbert for his own coinage after he gained control of Kent. During Æthelwulf's reign, there were four main phases of the coinage distinguishable at both mints, though they are not exactly parallel and it is uncertain when the transitions took place. The first issue at Canterbury carried a design known as Saxoniorum, which had been used by Egbert {{for one of his}} own issues. This was replaced by a portrait design in about 843, which can be subdivided further; the earliest coins have cruder designs than the later <b>ones.</b> <b>At</b> the Rochester mint the sequence was reversed, with an initial portrait design replaced, also in about 843, by a non-portrait design carrying a cross-and-wedges pattern on the obverse.|$|E
5|$|While design {{management}} had {{its origins in}} business schools, it has increasingly become embedded in the curriculum in design schools, particularly at the postgraduate level. Teaching design to managers was pioneered at the London Business School in 1976, and the first programme of {{design management}} at a design school was started in the 1980s at the Royal College of Art (RCA), DeMontfort, Middlesex, Staffordshire. Although, in the UK, some design management courses have not been sustainable, including those at the RCA, Westminster and Middlesex, other postgraduate courses have flourished including <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> Brunel, Lancaster and more recently the University of the Arts with each providing a specific {{point of view on}} design management.|$|E
5|$|Jack survives {{and finds}} himself on Devil's Reef, where he discovers old {{smuggling}} tunnels beneath the seabed, leading {{him to the}} underwater city of Y'ha-nthlei. The city {{is found to be}} located below Devil's Reef and is the home of the Deep Ones and members of the Order. U.S. Navy submarines attempt to torpedo Y'ha-nthlei, but are stopped by a magical barrier protecting the city. The Temple of Dagon {{is the source of the}} barrier, but the entrance is sealed off to prevent any interference. Jack finds another way in through ancient tunnels feared by the Deep <b>Ones</b> <b>at</b> the bottom of the city's foundations. Apparently, this passage, which leads to the temple, is an ancient prison for flying polyps, the enemy of the Great Race of Yith. Jack manages to defeat them with the help of a Yithian energy weapon. Jack then enters the Temple of Dagon and kills Mother Hydra - whose song is generating the barrier - by deafening himself to her song, allowing him to take control of Deep Ones. With the barrier down, the submarines attack the city, while Jack escapes through a portal leading back to the Order's headquarters and collapses in front of Hoover and Mackey.|$|E

5|$|On 19 March 1915, Prince of Wales {{was ordered}} to the Dardanelles to {{participate}} in the Dardanelles Campaign. She departed Portland on 20 March 1915 and was assigned to the British 5th Squadron of the Allied Fleet off the Dardanelles, where she arrived on 29 March. Prince of Wales supported the landings of the 3rd Brigade, Australian Army, at Gaba Tepe and Anzac Cove on 25 April. Her time at the Dardanelles was destined to be short as the Anglo-French-Italian Naval Convention of 10 May required that the British furnish a squadron of four battleships to reinforce the Italian Navy against the Austro-Hungarian Navy after Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that the threat from Austro-Hungarian submarines and naval mines in the narrow waters of the Adriatic was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. He therefore kept his most modern battleships, plus the British <b>ones,</b> <b>at</b> Taranto to blockade the Austro-Hungarians in the Adriatic Sea.|$|E
5|$|On June 14, 2010, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg {{launched}} the NYC Media Lab to promote innovations in New York's media industry. Situated at the New York University Tandon School of Engineering, the lab is {{a consortium of}} Columbia University, New York University, and New York City Economic Development Corporation acting to connect companies with universities in new technology research. The Lab is modeled after similar <b>ones</b> <b>at</b> MIT and Stanford. A $250,000 grant from the New York City Economic Development Corporation was used to establish the NYC Media Lab. Each year, the lab will host a range of roundtable discussions between {{the private sector and}} academic institutions. It will support research projects on topics of content format, next-generation search technologies, computer animation for film and gaming, emerging marketing techniques, and new devices development. The lab will also create a media research and development database. Columbia University will coordinate the long-term direction of the media lab as well as the involvement of its faculty and those of other universities.|$|E
5|$|The lingual row {{contains}} three cusps and the labial probably five (the {{broken corner}} renders the number uncertain). Transverse ridges, separated by deep valleys, connect the lingual and labial cusps; therefore, the cusps are not strongly separate, but rather fused. The lingual cusps are larger and separated by larger valleys than the labial <b>ones.</b> <b>At</b> {{the front of}} the tooth is a triangular structure consisting of the first lingual and the first two labial cusps. A low crest connects the first lingual to the first labial cusp and a stronger crest, separated from the first by a relatively shallow valley, connects the second lingual to the first labial cusp. Behind this structure, a second triangle is formed by two crests passing from the second lingual cusp to two cusps at the labial side (the back of the two is broken away, but its existence is presumed from the crown pattern). The front of these two crests is interrupted by a groove. The third lingual cusp is also connected to two crests, which encircle a small depression and presumably connected to one or more labial cusps, which are missing from the fossil.|$|E
