5|$|Periyar {{felt that}} {{a small number of}} cunning people created caste distinctions to {{dominate}} over society, so he emphasised that individuals must first develop self-respect and learn to analyse propositions rationally. According to Periyar, a self-respecting rationalist would readily realise that caste system had been stifling self-respect and therefore he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> strive {{to get rid of this}} menace.|$|E
5|$|To {{satisfy the}} {{prejudice}} prong of Strickland, a defendant who pleads guilty must {{show that there}} is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's deficient performance, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not have plead guilty. In Padilla v. Kentucky (2010), the Court held that counsel's failure to inform an alien pleading guilty of the risk of deportation fell below the objective standard of the performance prong of Strickland and permitted an alien who would not have plead guilty but for such failure to withdraw his guilty plea.|$|E
5|$|In {{the event}} of a vacancy in the governor's office, the state {{constitution}} specified that the President of the New Jersey State Senate, the upper chamber of the state legislature, would assume the role of acting governor without relinquishing his or her powerful role in the state senate. Further, if the acting governorship filled by the state senate president were vacated or that person could not assume the office, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be succeeded by the Speaker of the New Jersey General Assembly, the state legislature's lower chamber. This order of succession was included in the first state constitution in 1776, reinstated in the subsequent 1844 constitution, and kept in the 1947 Constitution until the 2006 amendment.|$|E

5|$|As {{the people}} inside the church scattered, the Mouzalon {{brothers}} tried to hide: George hid under the altar, Andronikos behind a door, and Theodore in a corner by the emperor's tomb. The mob, however, proceeded to search the church for them, and George was discovered by a Latin soldier named Karoulos ("Charles"). Mouzalon was dragged from under the altar and, despite pleading to ransom his life, was executed. So great was the frenzy of the crowd that his corpse was repeatedly stabbed and hacked to pieces, so that the parts had to be gathered in a sack for burial afterwards. Andronikos and an unnamed brother-in-law too were slain, while Theodore's fate is uncertain: some scholars believe he survived and is {{to be identified with}} Theodore Mouzalon, a chief minister to both Michael VIII and Andronikos II Palaiologos (r. 1282–1328). The Mouzalon family's houses were then ransacked by the mob; and when George Mouzalon's wife fled to her uncle Michael Palaiologos and pleaded for her husband's life, she was brusquely told to be quiet <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> share his fate. Palaiologos's responsibility in the whole affair is further supported by the fact that none of the Mouzalones' murderers were ever prosecuted. Indeed, the mercenary Charles appears later as Palaiologos's confidant.|$|E

Since no candidate won a majority, the candidates that won the most votes in each party appeared on the ballot for the general runoff election, held on July 14.|$|E

25|$|In 1968, Belafonte {{appeared}} on a Petula Clark primetime television special on NBC. In {{the middle of a}} duet of On the Path of Glory, Clark smiled and briefly touched Belafonte's arm, which prompted complaints from Doyle Lott, the advertising manager of the show's sponsor, Plymouth Motors. Lott wanted to retape the segment, but Clark, who had ownership of the special, told NBC that the performance would be shown intact <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not allow it to be aired at all. Newspapers reported the controversy, Lott was relieved of his responsibilities, and when the special aired, it attracted high ratings.|$|E

25|$|Kierkegaard {{primarily}} discusses subjectivity {{with regard}} to religious matters. As already noted, he argues that doubt {{is an element of}} faith and {{that it is impossible to}} gain any objective certainty about religious doctrines such as the existence of God or the life of Christ. The most one could hope for would be the conclusion that it is probable that the Christian doctrines are true, but if a person were to believe such doctrines only to the degree they seemed likely to be true, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not be genuinely religious at all. Faith consists in a subjective relation of absolute commitment to these doctrines.|$|E
25|$|Rigg was {{initially}} {{unhappy with the}} way she was treated by the show's producers. During her first series she learned she was being paid less than the camera man. She demanded a raise, to put her more on a par with her co-star, <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> leave the show. The producers gave in, thanks to the show's great popularity in the US. At the end of the fifth series in 1967, Rigg left to pursue other projects. This included following Honor Blackman to play a leading role in a James Bond film, in this case On Her Majesty's Secret Service as James Bond's wife Tracy Bond.|$|E
25|$|The Hindu epic, Mahabharata tells {{that the}} Vasus, cursed by Vashishta, had {{requested}} Ganga {{to be their}} mother. Ganga incarnated and became the wife of King Shantanu on condition that at no stage shall he question her actions <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> leave him. As seven Vasus were born as their children, one after the other, Ganga drowned them in her own waters, freeing them from their punishment and the king made no opposition. Only when the eighth was born did the king finally oppose his wife, who therefore left him. So the eighth son, Dyaus incarnated, remained alive, imprisoned in mortal form and later became known in his mortal incarnation as Bhishma (Devavrata), {{who is one of}} the most respected characters of Mahabharata.|$|E

The Witches of the North and South are good, while the Witches of the East and West are wicked.

After Dorothy's house crushes the Wicked Witch of the East, thereby liberating the Munchkins from bondage, the Good Witch of the North tells Dorothy that she (the Witch of the North) is not as powerful as the Wicked Witch of the East had been, <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have freed the Munchkins herself.|$|E
25|$|Aids: The rider {{applies the}} outside leg {{slightly}} further back from its normal position, which activates the outside hind (the first {{beat of the}} intended lead). At the same time, he or she uses the outside rein to flex the horse's head toward the outside, which frees up the animal's inside shoulder, encouraging it to fall into that lead. If the rider were {{to ask for the}} left lead, for example, he <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> apply the right leg behind the girth and use the right rein to turn the horse's head to the right. To make the rider's intent even clearer, the horse may be angled slightly toward the outside rail of the arena, which will guide it into taking the correct lead as it goes towards the unobstructed inside, and also discourages the horse from simply running onto the forehand.|$|E
25|$|In early 2017, Khan co-starred in Rahul Dholakia's Indian film Raees, {{which was}} her {{debut in the}} Hindi Film Industry. Before the release of film, 'Indian Motion Picture Producers Association' (IMPPA) and 'The Film Producers Guild of India' decided to ban all Pakistani actors, actresses and {{technicians}} working in India due to the tensions created after 2016 Uri terror attack, till the situation gets normal. Reportedly, there was rumours that Khan's scenes would be deleted from the film <b>or</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be replaced by some other actress. Shah Rukh Khan, the lead star and co-producer of the film, {{said that she would}} not be allowed to promote the film in India. Mahira Khan repeatedly received threats from Shiv Sena, an Indian far-right political party. Despite of controversies, the film was released in January 2017 and commercially, the film was a modest success, earning over ₹3.0 billion (US$39 million) worldwide which made Khan first Pakistani actress to join Bollywood's 100 Crore Club and became top grossing actress in Bollywood during the first quarter of 2017.|$|E
