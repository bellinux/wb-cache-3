5|$|The {{chairman}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Subcommittee</b> on Regulatory Affairs, Stimulus Oversight and Government Spending, U.S. Representative Jim Jordan {{held hearings}} on January 25, 2012, to investigate why the NHTSA opened a formal investigation only {{five months after}} the first postcrash battery fire occurred in June.
