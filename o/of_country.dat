5|$|Rock {{and roll}} {{developed}} out <b>of</b> <b>country,</b> blues, and R Rock's exact origins and early influences have been hotly debated, {{and are the}} subjects of much scholarship. Though squarely in the blues tradition, rock took elements from Afro-Caribbean and Latin musical techniques. Rock was an urban style, formed in the areas where diverse populations resulted in the mixtures of African American, Latin and European genres ranging from the blues and country to polka and zydeco. Rock and roll first entered popular music through a style called rockabilly, which fused the nascent sound with elements <b>of</b> <b>country</b> music. Black-performed rock and roll had previously had limited mainstream success, {{but it was the}} white performer Elvis Presley who first appealed to mainstream audiences with a black style of music, becoming one of the best-selling musicians in history, and brought rock and roll to audiences across the world.|$|E
5|$|Shotgun Willie was {{released}} in June 1973. In spite of poor sales, the album received good reviews and gained Nelson major recognition with younger audiences.

5|$|The Nashville {{sound was}} a popular kind <b>of</b> <b>country</b> music that arose in the 1950s, a fusion of popular big band jazz and swing with the lyricism of honky-tonk country. The popular success of Hank Williams' {{recordings}} had convinced record labels that country music could find mainstream audiences. Record companies then tried to strip the rough, honky-tonk elements from country music, removing the unapologetically rural sound that had made Williams famous. Nashville's industry was reacting {{to the rise of}} rockabilly performer Elvis Presley by marketing performers that crossed the divide between country and pop. Chet Atkins, head of RCA's country music division, did the most to innovate the Nashville sound by abandoning the rougher elements <b>of</b> <b>country,</b> while Owen Bradley used sophisticated production techniques and smooth instrumentation that eventually became standard in the Nashville Sound, which also grew to incorporate strings and vocal choirs. By {{the early part of the}} 1960s, the Nashville sound was perceived as watered-down by many more traditionalist performers and fans, resulting in a number of local scenes like the Lubbock sound and, most influentially, the Bakersfield sound.|$|E
5|$|The early 1970s saw {{the rise}} of a new style <b>of</b> <b>country</b> music that was as rough and hard-edged, and which quickly became the most popular form <b>of</b> <b>country.</b> This was outlaw country, a style that {{included}} such mainstream stars as Willie Nelson and Waylon Jennings. Outlaw country was very rock-oriented, and had lyrics that focused on the criminal, especially drug and alcohol-related, antics of its performers, who grew their hair long, wore denim and leather and looked like hippies in contrast to the clean-cut country singers that were pushing the Nashville sound.|$|E
5|$|The film {{encompasses}} {{several different}} themes, including {{the importance of}} love and family, the possibility of spiritual resurrection amid death, {{and the concept of}} redemption through Mac Sledge's conversion to Christianity.
