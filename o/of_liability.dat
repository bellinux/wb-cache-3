The {{result of the}} Third Report of the Law Reform Committee, the Act was {{introduced}} to Parliament as the Occupiers' Liability Bill and granted the Royal Assent on 6 June 1957, coming into force on 1 January 1958. The Act unified several classes of visitors to property and the duty of care owed {{to them by the}} occupier, as well as codifying elements of the common law relating to this duty of care. It also covered the duty owed to parties to a contract entering the property and ways of excluding the liability for visitors. The Act introduced an element <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> for landlords who failed to maintain their properties and were as a result responsible for the injury of a non-tenant, something counter to the previous common law rule in English law. The Act is still valid law, and forms much of the law relating to occupiers' liability in English law along with the Occupiers' Liability Act 1984.|$|E

25|$|Liability {{insurance}} {{is a very}} broad superset that covers legal claims against the insured. Many types of insurance include an aspect <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> coverage. For example, a homeowner's insurance policy will normally include liability coverage which protects the insured {{in the event of}} a claim brought by someone who slips and falls on the property; automobile insurance also includes an aspect <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> insurance that indemnifies against the harm that a crashing car can cause to others' lives, health, or property. The protection offered by a liability insurance policy is twofold: a legal defense {{in the event of a}} lawsuit commenced against the policyholder and indemnification (payment on behalf of the insured) with respect to a settlement or court verdict. Liability policies typically cover only the negligence of the insured, and will not apply to results of wilful or intentional acts by the insured.|$|E

Even {{though there is}} no Czech equivalent for the institution <b>of</b> criminal <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> legal entities, and consequently it cannot be part of Czech legal system, there have been many heated debates, conducted both by professionals, politicians and amateurs. Czech criminal law does not contain the term collective responsibility, as it is traditionally based on the individual criminal liability. It has adopted the principle societas delinquere non potest, and for this reason the introduction <b>of</b> criminal <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> legal entities would be perceived as massive change, change that could have profound impact on the Czech criminal law as such. The topic is controversial; it is manifested in the way the arguments pro and contra are submitted. The thesis consists of seven chapters. Basic definitions are followed by a short historical overview <b>of</b> delictual <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> legal entities in European continental law. Next chapter lists arguments pro and contra introduction <b>of</b> criminal <b>liability</b> <b>of</b> legal entities.
