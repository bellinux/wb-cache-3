25|$|Police {{brutality}} in Greece today predominantly {{manifests itself}} {{in the form of}} unjustified and extreme physical violence towards protesters and journalists. Amnesty International highlights that the continued targeting of journalists is very concerning as it infringes on the right to freedom of expression. According to a recent Amnesty International report there have been multiple instances in which police have used excessive brutal force, have misused less-lethal weapons against protesters, have attacked journalists, and have subjected bystanders to ill treatment, particularly {{over the course of the}} anniversary of the 1973 student uprising against the Military Junta, as mentioned previously, which took place on November 17, 2014. Allegations against police have emerged specifically in relation to their use of brutal force, completely unprovoked, towards journalists documenting the demonstration, and against many students who partook in a peaceful protest. Allegedly police sprayed protesters with chemical irritants from close range – in one instance a 17 year <b>old</b> <b>girl</b> with asthma had been treated in hospital after this attack and when she informed police of her condition they merely laughed.|$|E

[...] Reinecke forwarded the letter to Nixon aide John Ehrlichman with the comment, [...] "I suspect that Carla's reaction may be shared by other young people who worked in the Nixon campaign". Nixon assistant Charles E. Stuart replied to Reinecke, stating, [...] "Vicki Lynne has been invited to the inauguration not because she carried the sign, or even because she made the sign, but rather because the sign which she did carry proved to be an inspiration to Mr. Nixon" [...] and expressed his confidence the invitation would be well received by other young Nixon partisans.|$|E

Her barking deliberately alerted the guards to when there was something too large for her to handle in the jungle, such as tigers or elephants.|$|E

500|$|Filming was {{temporarily}} delayed on September 2, 2010, when an extra was seriously injured during a stunt in Hammond, Indiana. Due to a failed weld, a steel cable snapped {{from a car}} being towed and hit the extra's car, damaging her skull. The extra, identified as Gabriela Cedillo, had to undergo brain surgery. The injury has left her permanently brain-damaged, paralyzed on her left side and her left eye stitched shut. Paramount admitted responsibility for the accident and covered all of Cedillo's medical costs. Nevertheless, Cedillo's family filed a lawsuit on October 5, citing seven counts of negligence against Paramount, and several other defendants (not including Bay), with total damages sought in excess of $350,000. Cedillo's attorney, Todd Smith, said, [...] "This was an attractive 24-year <b>old</b> <b>girl</b> who had dreams and aspirations involving acting, {{and this kind of}} injury may well have a serious impact on her dreams." [...] The filed complaint reads that [...] "Cedillo has endured and will in the future endure pain and suffering; has become disfigured and disabled; has suffered a loss of the enjoyment of a normal life; has been damaged in her capacity to earn a living; has incurred and will in the future incur expenses for medical services, all of which are permanent in nature." [...] In response to the suit, Paramount released the following statement: [...] "We are all terribly sorry that this accident occurred. Our thoughts, prayers and best wishes are with Gabriela, her family and loved ones. The production will continue to provide all the help we can to Gabriela and her family during this difficult time." [...] On May 2012, it was revealed that an $18 million settlement had been reached between Paramount and the Cedillo family.|$|E
