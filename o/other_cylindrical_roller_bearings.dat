40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to numerically {{investigate}} one source of acoustic noise in <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> that which results from the motion of the <b>rollers</b> in the <b>bearing</b> under zero exter-nal load. For the sake of simplification, it was assumed that the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> are infinitely long. Furthermore, the effects of the following on the noise of the bearing were also examined: the radial clearance of the bearing, the viscosity of the lubricant, and the number of rollers. The results of the study show that the fundamental frequency of the noise components of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> corresponds to the multiplica-tion of the number of rollers and the whirling frequency of the roller center. The acoustical frequency spectra of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> are pure tone spectra, containing the fundamental frequency of the <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> and its superharmonics. The fac-tors that decrease the sound pressure level of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> include low lubricant viscosity, high radial clearance, and a reduced number of rollers. The results and discussions of the present article could aid in the design of low-noise <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{finite element}} method is adopted to analyze the pre-loaded <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> {{according}} {{to the theory of}} contact mechanics. The effects of hollow ratio on the radial stiffness of bearings, the maximum contact stress of rollers, and the maximum radial load of bearing are analyzed. The analysis results show that the smaller the hollowness is, the larger the radial stiffness of pre-loaded <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> the maximum contact stress of the rollers, and the maximum radial load of the bearing would be. Under different magnitude loads, the reasonable combination of interference magnitude with the hollowness can not only increase the stiffness of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> but also decrease the maximum stress of rollers, which provides a reference for the design and manufacture of pre-loaded <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings...</b>|$|R
40|$|Distribution of {{loads and}} contact stress {{has a great}} {{influence}} on fatigue life of bearings. In {{view of the fact}} that the nonload area is ubiquitous in <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings,</b> there is a method for prolonging the fatigue life design by adjusting the working clearance of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings.</b> In this article, optimization model of fatigue life of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> is developed with a quasi-dynamic method and calculated method of bearing life based on micro-area contact, considering the effect of assembly interference, temperature rise, and high-speed centrifugation. Aiming to the different geometry parameters and operating parameters of bearings, the effects of assembly interference on bearing fatigue life are discussed. The results show that the optimum fatigue life of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> is achieved at negative working clearance with the loads distributed evenly within half ring. The optimum working clearance of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> is not influenced by radial load. But with the increase in pitch diameter or decrease in rolling elements, the optimum assembly interference increases, and accelerating revolution of <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> will increase the optimum assembly interference as well...|$|R

40|$|In this work, a {{three-dimensional}} dynamic simulation model for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> is developed based on multi-body-simulation software SIMPACK and programming language FORTRAN. The {{aim of this}} work {{is to build a}} universal program to calculate the dynamic behavior of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings.</b> This simulation model integrates major part of the functionalities according to {{the state of the art}} of existing programs which are: the slice model, the mutual influences of neighboring slices, the basic three-dimensional model, the calculation of lubricant film thickness and damping forces, the radial clearance, the roller-pocket clearance, the centrifugal forces and the hysteresis damping forces. The extended functionalities in this work can be summarized as follows: 1) Roller-pocket contact stiffness is taken into account and calculated with the help of finite element analysis. 2) The three types of cage guidance are modeled in details which are roller guidance, inner ring guidance and outer ring guidance. 3) The geometry of cage pocket is modeled for contact detection. 4) The elasticity of cage is built through importing the reduced finite element models. This extended model of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> is validated with the measurements and shows good agreement. Furthermore, for further plausibility of this model and also extension of the understanding of the dynamic behavior of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> such as <b>roller</b> slip, roller-pocket contact forces and cage mass center orbit, parameter variations in terms of different cage materials, cage guidance, radial clearances, roller-pocket clearances, are carried out. Lastly the bearing model is integrated in an existing multi-body-simulation model of a wind turbine namely in the main gearbox, in order to check the plausibility of this bearing model in wind turbines, based on the known behaviors of bearings. Through the further development of simulation model, the current established range of functions is extended. Thus the interpretation of bearings in engineering as well as the understanding of fundamental dynamic interactions during the design of <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> is improved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBearings are key {{components}} of cone bit, thus its rapid failure is {{a major cause of}} leading to lower life of the bit. To improve the bearing performance and prolong working life, contact mechanics of hollow <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> of cone bit was simulated. Effects of hollow size, drilling pressure, friction coefficient and fitting clearance on mechanics performance of the bearing were studied. The results show that the maximum equivalent stress of the hollow <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> appears on the claw journal, and the maximum contact stress appears on the contact pair of the hollow roller. Besides, hollow sizes have a greater impact on the equivalent stress and contact stress of the <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller,</b> while the influence on the stress of the cone and claw journal is relatively small. With the increasing of the drilling pressure and fitting clearance, equivalent stress and contact stress of bearing parts increase. The friction coefficient has little impact on mechanical performance of the bearing. As the 121 / 4 SWPI 517 type hollow <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> of cone bit an example, the optimal hollow size is 55 %, the drilling pressure is 140  kN and the fitting clearance is 0 – 0. 02  mm...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} hoop {{stresses}} in reducing <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> fatigue life was determined for various classes of inner ring interference fit. Calculations were performed {{for up to}} seven interference fit classes for each of ten bearing sizes. Each fit was taken at tightest, average and loosest values within the fit class for RBEC- 5 tolerance, thus requiring 486 separate analyses. The hoop stresses were superimposed on the Hertzian principal stresses created by the applied radial load to calculate <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> fatigue life. The method was developed {{through a series of}} equations to calculate the life reduction for <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearings</b> based on interference fit. All calculated lives are for zero initial bearing internal clearance. Any reduction in bearing clearance due to interference fit was compensated by increasing the initial (unmounted) clearance. Results are presented as tables and charts of life factors for bearings with light, moderate and heavy loads and interference fits ranging from extremely light to extremely heavy and for bearing accuracy class RBEC 5 (ISO class 5). Interference fits on the inner bearing ring of a <b>cylindrical</b> <b>roller</b> <b>bearing</b> can significantly reduce bearing fatigue life. In general, life factors are smaller (lower life) for bearings running under light load where the unfactored life is highest. The various bearing series within a particular bore size had almost identical interference fit life factors for a particular fit. The tightest fit at {{the high end of the}} RBEC- 5 tolerance band defined in ANSI/ABMA shaft fit tables produces a life factor of approximately 0. 40 for an inner-race maximum Hertz stress of 1200 MPa (175 ksi) and a life factor of 0. 60 for an inner-race maximum Hertz stress of 2200 MPa (320 ksi).
