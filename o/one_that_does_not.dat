25|$|Cantor's {{article also}} {{contains}} a proof {{of the existence of}} transcendental numbers. As early as 1930, mathematicians have disagreed on whether this proof is constructive or non-constructive. Books as recent as 2014 and 2015 indicate that this disagreement has not been resolved. Since Cantor's proof either constructs transcendental numbers or does not, an analysis of his article can determine whether his proof is constructive or non-constructive. Cantor's correspondence with Richard Dedekind shows the development of his ideas and reveals that he had a choice between two proofs, one that uses the uncountability of the real numbers and <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not.</b>|$|E
25|$|She {{used the}} work as a {{platform}} to offer a new, more inclusive feminist theory. Her theory encouraged the long-standing idea of sisterhood but advocated for women to acknowledge their differences while still accepting each other. Hooks challenged feminists to consider gender's relation to race, class, and sex, a concept known as intersectionality. She also argues {{for the importance of}} male involvement in the equality movement, stating that, in order for change to occur, men must do their part. Hooks also calls for a restructuring of the cultural framework of power, <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> find oppression of others necessary.|$|E
25|$|In chemistry, a colloid is {{a mixture}} in which one {{substance}} of microscopically dispersed insoluble particles is suspended throughout another substance. Sometimes the dispersed substance alone is called the colloid; the term colloidal suspension refers unambiguously to the overall mixture (although a narrower {{sense of the word}} suspension is distinguished from colloids by larger particle size). Unlike a solution, whose solute and solvent constitute only one phase, a colloid has a dispersed phase (the suspended particles) and a continuous phase (the medium of suspension). To qualify as a colloid, the mixture must be <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> settle or would take a very long time to settle appreciably.|$|E

25|$|Age for {{decrease}} of L2 grammaticality performance varies from early childhood to late adolescence, {{depending on the}} combinations of the speaker’s first and second language. The age of acquisition at which L2 learners are worse than native speakers depends on how dissimilar the L1 and L2 are on phonological and grammatical level. For example, Chinese/English bilinguals at 7 years old perform {{just as well as}} Spanish/English bilinguals at 16 years old. This {{is due to the fact}} that a grammatical construction on an L2 that has a parallel structure in an L1 would impose less processing demand than <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have a parallel, causing a poorer performance on language structure.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the early}} 1970s, Brittany has {{experienced}} a tremendous revival of its folk music. Numerous festivals were created, along with smaller fest-noz (popular feasts). The bagadoù, bands composed of bagpipes, bombards and drums (including snare), are also a modern creation, inspired by the Scottish pipe bands. The Lann-Bihoué bagad, {{one of the most}} well-known, belongs to the French Navy. It is the only <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> take part to the annual bagadoù competitions. Celtic harp is also common, as are vocals and dances. The Kan ha diskan is {{the most common type of}} singing. The performers sing calls and responses while dancing. Breton dances usually imply circles, chains or couples and they are different in every region. The oldest dances seem to be the passepied and the gavotte, and the newest ones derive from the quadrille and French Renaissance dances.|$|E
25|$|In {{a similar}} way as with {{synthetic}} alcohol production, hydrogen {{can be used on}} site to directly (nonbiologically) produce greenhouse-neutral gaseous fuels. Thus, captive-hydrogen-mediated production of greenhouse-neutral methane has been proposed (note that this is the reverse of the present method of acquiring hydrogen from natural methane, but <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> require ultimate burning and release of fossil fuel carbon). Captive hydrogen (and carbon dioxide from, for example, CCS (Carbon Capture & Storage)) may be used onsite to synthesize methane, using the Sabatier reaction. This is about 60% efficient, and with the round trip reducing to 20 to 36% depending on the method of fuel utilization. This is even lower than hydrogen, but the storage costs drop by at least a factor of 3, because of methane's higher boiling point and higher energy density. Liquid methane has 3.2 times the energy density of liquid hydrogen and is easier to store compactly. Additionally, the pipe infrastructure (natural gas pipelines) are already in place. Natural-gas-powered vehicles already exist, and are known to be easier to adapt from existing internal engine technology, than internal combustion autos running directly on hydrogen. Experience with natural gas powered vehicles shows that methane storage is inexpensive, once one has accepted the cost of conversion to store the fuel. However, the cost of alcohol storage is even lower, so this technology would need to produce methane at a considerable savings with regard to alcohol production. Ultimate mature prices of fuels in the competing technologies are not presently known, but both are expected to offer substantial infrastructural savings over attempts to transport and use hydrogen directly.|$|E

[...] Stef, the Variety reviewer, called Angelou's act [...] "sizzling" [...] and a [...] "unique creation in the jazz world when everything progressive {{is expected to be}} on the cool side". [...] He called the song [...] "Polymon Bongo" [...] "recitative" [...] and complimented its conversational nature with the drums. [...] He commented on the intimacy and sharpness in Angelou's performance of [...] "The Heat is On", a song she wrote but <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> appear on the album. [...] He called [...] "Calypso Blues", written by Nat King Cole and Don George, [...] "an artfully simple welding of idioms" [...] and another song she composed, [...] "Scandal in the Family", [...] "standard Trinidad calypso stuff" [...] and reported that her performance of it [...] "rocked the house".|$|E
500|$|The 2006 {{extension}} of Section 5 was challenged before the Supreme Court in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder (2009). The lawsuit was brought by a municipal water district in Texas that elected members to a water board. The District wished {{to move a}} voting location from a private home to a public school, but that change was subject to preclearance because Texas was a covered jurisdiction. The District did not register voters, and thus it {{did not appear to}} qualify as a [...] "political subdivision" [...] eligible to bail out of coverage. Although the Court indicated in dicta (a non-binding part of the court's opinion) that Section 5 presented difficult constitutional questions, it did not declare Section 5 unconstitutional; instead, it interpreted the law to allow any covered local government, including <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> register voters, to obtain an exemption from preclearance if it meets the bailout requirements.|$|E

500|$|Other parodies {{have been}} presented, {{including}} the devil corollary, the no devil corollary and the extreme no devil corollary. The devil corollary proposes that a being than which nothing worse can be conceived {{exists in the}} understanding (sometimes the term lesser is used in place of worse). Using Anselm's logical form, the parody argues that if it exists in the understanding, a worse being would be one that exists in reality; thus, such a being exists. The no devil corollary is similar, but argues that a worse being would be <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> exist in reality, so does not exist. The extreme no devil corollary advances on this, proposing that a worse being would be that which {{does not exist in}} the understanding, so such a being exists neither in reality nor in the understanding. Timothy Chambers argued that the devil corollary is more powerful than Gaunilo's challenge because it withstands the challenges that may defeat Gaunilo's parody. He also claimed that the no devil corollary is a strong challenge, as it [...] "underwrites" [...] the no devil corollary, which [...] "threatens Anselm's argument at its very foundations".|$|E
500|$|Zombie further {{described}} Laurie as a [...] "wreck", who continually sinks lower as {{the film}} moves forward. Even Sheriff Brackett goes through changes. Brackett, who receives more screen time in this film, allows Laurie {{to move in with}} him and his daughter after the events of the first film. Zombie explained, [...] "He's old, he's worn out, he's just this beat-down guy with these two girls he can't deal with." [...] Zombie characterized Loomis in the sequel as more of a [...] "sellout", who exploits the memories of those who were killed by Michael in the 2007 film. Zombie explained that he tried to channel Vincent Bugliosi, a lawyer who prosecuted Charles Manson and then wrote a book about it, into Loomis's character for the sequel; noting that he wanted Loomis to seem more [...] "ridiculous" [...] this time. As for Michael Myers, the character is given almost an entirely new look for the film, which is being used, according to Taylor-Compton, to illustrate a new emotion for the character as he {{spends much of his time}} trying to hide himself. Zombie said that of all of the characters that return in the sequel, Michael is the only <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> change: [...] "All the other characters are very different. Laurie; Loomis; they're having all kinds of problems in their life, but Michael just moves along. Michael is no different; he's exactly the same as he was ten years old and he killed everybody [...] He has no concept of the world around him, so he can never be affected by it." ...|$|E
