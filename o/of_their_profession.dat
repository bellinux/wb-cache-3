25|$|The Japanese {{government}} was also displeased {{with the film}} because it was released during the Tokyo Olympics, {{at a time when}} the world's attention was focused on the country. The authorities were not happy with the impression a widely released sex film might give. The Japan Dental Association protested against the film because of its unsavory depiction <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>profession</b> in the character of the dentist. Also, author Jun'ichirō Tanizaki was reportedly unhappy with the film. Tanizaki had worked with the cinema during the 1920s, and regarded Takechi's film as a sign of the decline of the Japanese cinema. Nevertheless, Daydream was a major success in Japan, greatly contributing to the acceptance of nudity in Japanese mainstream cinema.|$|E
25|$|A feature {{unique to}} Carthusian liturgical {{practice}} {{is that the}} bishop bestows on Carthusian nuns, in the ceremony <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>profession,</b> a stole and a maniple. This is interpreted {{by some as a}} relic of the former rite of ordination of women deacons. The nun is also invested with a crown and a ring. The nun wears these ornaments again only on the day of her monastic jubilee and on her bier after her death. At Matins, if no priest or deacon is present, a nun assumes the stole and reads the Gospel; and although in the time of the Tridentine Mass the chanting of the Epistle was reserved to an ordained subdeacon, a consecrated nun sang the Epistle at the conventual Mass, though without wearing the maniple. For centuries Carthusian nuns retained this rite, administered by the diocesan bishop four years after the nun took her vows. It is no longer unique, since the liturgical reforms that followed Second Vatican Council made the rite of the consecration of virgins more widely available.|$|E

M. 113b), and was especially skilful in treating the eye (B.
