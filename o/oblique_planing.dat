30|$|In {{order to}} assess the true {{deformity}} in the <b>oblique</b> <b>plane,</b> we use a method which requires an axial cross-sectional image (transverse plane) and {{an image of the}} hip in the AP position (coronal plane). Using these two images, the deformity can be calculated in the <b>oblique</b> <b>plane.</b> The head–neck angle is measured from the AP pelvis film to give angle x (Fig.  1). The head–neck angle is measured from the axial computed tomography (CT) scan to give angle y (Fig.  2). From this. the <b>oblique</b> <b>plane</b> deformity angle z can be calculated.|$|R

30|$|Bone {{deformity}} is {{a combination}} of angulation and rotation commonly. Coronal plane angular deformity (varus and valgus) is seen on AP radiographs, and sagittal plane angular deformity (procurvatum and recurvatum) is seen on lateral radiographs. Deformity measured on both AP and lateral radiographs can be resolved into a single <b>oblique</b> <b>plane.</b> Imaging at right angles to this <b>oblique</b> <b>plane</b> of deformity shows the maximum deformity (as seen in profile), whereas imaging into the plane of deformity shows no deformity.|$|R

30|$|The intraclass {{correlation}} coefficient (ICC) {{was used to}} measure the intraobserver and interobserver reliabilities, with 1.0 being perfect agreement and 0 indicating agreement by chance alone. Excellent reliability was defined as an ICC > 0.9, good 0.8 – 0.9 and fair 0.7 – 0.8. The intraobserver reliability was calculated for each variable (AP, axial, <b>oblique</b> <b>plane)</b> and the same images were re-examined by the same observers in order to calculate the intraobserver reliability for the <b>oblique</b> <b>plane</b> calculation between the first reading and the second reading.|$|R
30|$|The {{magnitude}} of the mean angles in our series also gives important information. The mean deformity (66 °, range 43 – 83) in the axial plane was twice that of the mean coronal plane deformity (33 °, range 4 – 63). The mean <b>oblique</b> <b>plane</b> deformity was even higher at 75 ° (range 43 – 98). This shows that the true deformity can be significantly underestimated when relying on one image, particularly the AP radiograph. This study demonstrates that the true {{magnitude of}} the deformity in the <b>oblique</b> <b>plane</b> can be accurately and reliably measured with little inter- and intraobserver variability.|$|R
40|$|Objective: The optimal MRI scan {{planes of}} {{collateral}} ligaments of the ankle {{have been described}} extensively, {{with the exception of}} the syndesmotic ligaments. We assessed the optimal scan plane for depicting the distal tibiofibular syndesmosis. Materials and Methods: In order to determine the optimal oblique caudal-cranial and lateral-medial MRI scan plane, two fresh frozen cadaveric ankles were used. The angle of the scan plane that demonstrated the anterior and posterior distal tibiofibular ligament uninterrupted in their full length was determined. In a prospective study this <b>oblique</b> scan <b>plane</b> was then used in addition to the axial and coronal planes, for MRI scans of both ankles in 21 healthy volunteers. Two observers independently evaluated the anterior tibiofibular ligament (ATIFL) and posterior tibiofibular ligament (PTIFL) regarding the continuity of the individual fascicles, thickness and wavy contour of the ligaments in both the axial and the <b>oblique</b> <b>plane.</b> Kappa was calculated to determine the interobserver agreement. McNemar's test was used to statistically quantify the significance of the two scan planes. Results: In the axial plane the ATIFL was in 31 % (13 / 42) partly and in 69 % (29 / 42) completely discontinuous; in the <b>oblique</b> <b>plane</b> the ATIFL was continuous in 88 % (37 / 42) and partly discontinuous in 12 % (5 / 42). Compared with the axial <b>plane,</b> the <b>oblique</b> <b>plane</b> demonstrated significantly less discontinuity (p < 0. 001), but not significantly less thickening (p = 1. 00) or less wavy contour (p = 0. 06) of the ATIFL. In the axial scan plane the PTIFL was continuous in 76 % (32 / 42), partially discontinuous in 19 % (8 / 42) and completely discontinuous in 5 % (2 / 42); in the <b>oblique</b> <b>plane</b> the PTIFL was continuous in 100 % (42 / 42). Compared with the axial <b>plane,</b> the <b>oblique</b> <b>plane</b> demonstrated significantly less discontinuity (p = 0. 002), but not significantly less thickening (p = 1. 00) or less wavy contour (p = 0. 50) of the PTIFL. The interobserver agreement score and kappa (κ) regarding the continuity for the ATIFL in the axial and <b>oblique</b> <b>planes</b> was 91 % (κ = 0. 79) and 91 % (κ = 0. 55) respectively; for the PTIFL it was 86 % (κ = 0. 65) and 100 % (κ = not defined). Conclusion: The ATIFL and PTIFL are routinuely scanned in the orthogonal planes. The advantage of MRI scanning in an <b>oblique</b> image <b>plane</b> of about 45 degrees permits a better evaluation of the ligaments compared with the axial plane, particularly a better interpretation of ligament continuity, thickening and wavy contour. This may lead to a reduction in false-positive results, especially regarding partial or complete ligament ruptures. This can be of considerable aid in therapeutic management...|$|R

OBJECTIVE: We developed a method for measuring SL and regional cell orientation using remote focusing microscopy, an emerging imaging modality that can capture light from arbitrary <b>oblique</b> <b>planes</b> within a sample. METHODS AND RESULTS: We present a protocol that unambiguously and quickly determines cell orientation from user-selected areas in a field of view by imaging 2 <b>oblique</b> <b>planes</b> that share a common major axis with the cell.

40|$|BACKGROUND Precise {{preoperative}} {{assessment of}} aortic annulus diameter {{is essential for}} sizing of aortic valve especially in patients planned for transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Computed Tomographic (CT) and echocardiographic measurements of the aortic annulus vary because of elliptical shape of aortic annulus. This study was undertaken to compare the measurement of aortic annulus intraoperatively with preoperative noninvasive methods in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. MATERIALS AND METHODS Aortic annulus diameter was measured with cardiac CT and Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE) prior to open aortic valve replacement in 30 patients with aortic valve stenosis. In CT, aortic annulus dimensions were measured in coronal <b>plane,</b> sagittal <b>oblique</b> <b>plane</b> and by planimetry. Both 2 -dimensional and 3 -dimensional TEE were used. These were compared with intraoperative measurements done by valve sizers and Hegar dilators. Pearson analysis was applied to test for degree of correlation. RESULTS CT in coronal and sagittal <b>oblique</b> <b>plane</b> tends to overestimate the diameter of aortic annulus when compared with intraoperative measurements (coefficient of relation, r = 0. 798 and 0. 749, respectively). CT measurements in single <b>oblique</b> <b>plane</b> showed a weaker correlation with intraoperative measurements than 3 D TEE and 2 D TEE (r = 0. 917 and 0. 898, respectively). However, CT measurements by planimetry method were most correlating with the intraoperative measurements (r = 0. 951). CONCLUSION Noninvasive investigations with 3 -dimensional views (CT-based measurement employing calculated average diameter assessment by planimetry and 3 -dimensional TEE) showed better correlation with intraoperative measurement of aortic annulus. CT-based aortic annulus measurement by planimetry seems to provide adequate dimensions most similar to operative measurements. ...|$|R

30|$|Based on the anteroposterior (AP) radiograph, Wilson {{defined a}} severe slip as {{one with a}} slip greater than half the metaphyseal {{diameter}} [7]. The Southwick angle is measured on the frog lateral radiograph. It is {{the difference in the}} head–shaft angle between the slip and non-slipped side. A slip of less than 30 ° is a “mild” slip using this method of measurement. A slip of greater than 50 ° is considered a severe slip [3]. These methods of classification are only based on one plane, either the coronal plane (AP radiograph) or the sagittal plane (lateral radiograph). However, the common deformity in SCFE is a combination of rotational torsion, varus (but valgus is possible) and posterior angulation. Therefore, the true direction of the deformity is oblique. Furthermore, the true magnitude in the <b>oblique</b> <b>plane</b> will be higher than that measured in the coronal or sagittal plane. Paley has popularised the concept that, if the magnitude of angulation is known in two orthogonal <b>planes,</b> the true <b>oblique</b> <b>plane</b> deformity can be calculated either graphically or mathematically [8].|$|R
