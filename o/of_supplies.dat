40|$|Abstract- Based on the {{regulation}} of grid fees and the regulatory requirements on the quality <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> grid operators attempt to find an optimal balance between costs and quality <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> One main aspect of the quality <b>of</b> <b>supply</b> is the non-availability <b>of</b> <b>supply,</b> which strongly depends on {{the duration of the}} re-supply process and therefore on the availability of resources. Consequently, grid operators need to analyze the relation between a certain configuration of resources and the corresponding costs and quality <b>of</b> <b>supply.</b> Focusing on the re-supply process in medium- and lowvoltage grids, this paper presents a detailed grid operation model which allows to quantify this relation. Depending on legal, regulatory or strategic requirements, this model allows to evaluate and compare different configurations of resources and the resulting quality <b>of</b> <b>supply...</b>|$|R
