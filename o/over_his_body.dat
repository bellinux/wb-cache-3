5|$|Matt Bissonnette, a SEAL {{who participated}} in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day (2012), which {{significantly}} contradicts Pfarrer's account.

5|$|The male wanders as {{an adult}} and in August or September goes looking for the females' webs to mate. The male will enter the female's web and vibrate the silk as he {{approaches}} her. The female is usually aggressive at first and will chase the male from the web. The Courtship process consists of the male bobbing, plucking and tweaking the web along with periods of cautious approach and being chased by the female. Eventually, when she becomes docile and allows him to approach, the male will then approach the female as she hangs quietly upside down in the web. The male moves onto her ventral abdomen, tapping her rapidly until she moves to align his abdomen above hers. He then inserts his palps one at a time, leaving the female between each insertion. Copulation occurs over 10 to 30 minutes. After mating, the male retreats to groom, which is performed by running his palps and legs through his fangs and wiping them <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>body.</b> The male is not eaten by the female unlike some other widow spiders.|$|E

Arnaud would die from severe gunshot-induced blood loss at the scene, but the mortally wounded Magruder was able to call for assistance over her radio at 9:34p.m. Logan's father, {{who was in the}} house's master bedroom, had heard the gunshots, and thinking that the deputies had shot him, went over to see what had happened. Instead, he saw Logan leaving the house with a firearm in hand, and saw that the two deputies had been shot. Logan's father then called 9-1-1 via telephone at 9:39p.m. to report the shooting to authorities.

5|$|The prequel Birth by Sleep {{introduces}} Terra as {{an apprentice}} Keyblade wielder who trains alongside Aqua and Ventus at the Land of Departure.

This eventually leads Terra to clash with Eraqus when he finds his master inexplicably attacking Ventus, which ends with Xehanort vanquishing the weakened Eraqus.

Terra's disembodied mind inhabits his discarded armor and becomes the Lingering Will, which remains in the Keyblade Graveyard after defeating Xehanort.

25|$|Dyczkowski (1988: p.26) {{holds that}} Hāla's Prakrit {{literature}} poem the Gāthāsaptaśati (third to fifth century CE) {{is one of}} the first extant literary references to a Kapalika where in the poem the Kapalika, who is a female, anoints and besmears her body with the crematory ash from the funeral pyre of her recently deceased lover.

25|$|The Ganges is {{also the}} mother, the Ganga Mata (mata="mother") of Hindu worship and culture, {{accepting}} all and forgiving all. Unlike other goddesses, she has no destructive or fearsome aspect, destructive though she might be as a river in nature. She is also a mother to other gods. She accepts Shiva's incandescent seed from the fire-god Agni, which is too hot for this world, and cools it in her waters. This union produces Skanda, or Kartikeya, the god of war. In the Mahabharata, she is the wife of Shantanu, {{and the mother of}} heroic warrior-patriarch, Bhishma. When Bhishma is mortally wounded in battle, Ganga comes out of the water in human form and weeps uncontrollably <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

If a Tulsi stick is used to burn a lamp for Vishnu, it is like offering the gods lakhs of lamps. If one makes a paste of dried Tulsi wood (from a plant that died naturally) and smears it <b>over</b> <b>his</b> <b>body</b> and worships Vishnu, it is worth several ordinary pujas and lakhs of Godan (donation of cows). Water mixed with the Tulsi leaves is given to the dying to raise their departing souls to heaven.|$|E
