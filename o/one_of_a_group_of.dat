5|$|Although she {{had long}} broken her formal ties with the British Communist Party, Wilkinson {{retained}} strong links with other communist organisations at home and abroad. Her association with leading communists such as Willi Münzenberg and Otto Katz is revealed in British intelligence files held on her. However, she {{was not prepared to}} risk losing her parliamentary seat, and thus kept her rebellious behaviour within bounds. In 1937 Wilkinson was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Labour figures—Aneurin Bevan, Harold Laski and Stafford Cripps were others—who founded the left-wing magazine Tribune; in the first issue she wrote of the need to fight unemployment, poverty, malnutrition and inadequate housing. Mindful of the dependence of many low-income families on credit, she introduced a bill to regulate hire purchase agreements, at the time a subject of frequent abuse, and with all-party support she secured the passage of the Hire Purchase Act 1938.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 12th century the Bigod family {{had come to}} {{dominate}} Suffolk, holding {{the title of the}} Earl of Norfolk and owning Framlingham and three other major castles at Bungay, Walton and Thetford. The first set of stone buildings, including the first hall, were built within the castle during the 1160s. Tensions persisted throughout the period, however, between the Crown and the Bigods. Hugh Bigod was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> dissenting barons during the Anarchy in the reign of King Stephen, and after coming to power Henry II attempted to re-establish royal influence across the region. As part of this effort, Henry confiscated the four Bigod castles from Hugh in 1157, but returned both Framlingham and Bungay in 1165, on payment of a large fine of £666.|$|E

5|$|James de Connick {{established}} the first breed {{standard for the}} French Spaniel in 1891. At {{the turn of the}} 20th century, the numbers of French Spaniels dropped so low that they nearly became extinct due to competition from foreign sporting dogs, in particular as French hunters chose to hunt particularly with English breeds of hunting dogs. A French priest named Father Fournier undertook the task of gathering the remaining French Spaniels in his Saint Hillaire kennels in order to preserve the breed. There he built the lineages that are representatives of those we now have. The French Spaniel Club was founded in 1921, with Father Fournier {{as the president of the}} association. The modern French Spaniel is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> recognised French Spaniels, including the Brittany, Picardy and Blue Picardy.|$|E
5|$|Poulenc's wealthy family {{intended}} him for {{a business}} career in the Rhone Poulenc family company and did not allow him to enrol at a music college.

Poulenc soon came {{under the influence of}} Erik Satie, under whose tutelage he became <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> young composers known collectively as Les Six. In his early works Poulenc became known for his high spirits and irreverence.

5|$|Prior to the {{building}} of Orford Castle, Suffolk was dominated by the Bigod family, who held {{the title of the}} Earl of Norfolk and owned key castles at Framlingham, Bungay, Walton and Thetford. Hugh Bigod had been <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> dissenting barons during the Anarchy in the reign of King Stephen, and Henry II wished to re-establish royal influence across the region. Henry confiscated the four castles from Hugh, but returned Framlingham and Bungay to Hugh in 1165. Henry then decided to build his own royal castle at Orford, near Framlingham, and construction work began in 1165, concluding in 1173. The Orford site was around two miles (3.2km) from the sea, lying on flat ground with swampy terrain slowly stretching away down to the river Ore, about half a mile (0.8km) away.|$|E

5|$|Spruyt {{was the son}} of Jacobus Spuyt (1796–1839), a Dutch medical doctor, and Antje Landskroon. Both the Spruyt and Landskroon {{families}} {{stood in}} a tradition of medical practice, and three of the four brothers Spruyt had were doctors in the Netherlands. Spruyt himself trained as a lawyer at Leiden University, but probably did not finish his studies. He went on to work as a schoolteacher in the village of Oosterwolde in the north of the Netherlands. It was here that professor U.G. Lauts recruited him for South Africa in 1851. Lauts was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> Dutchmen, interested in the development of good education in the new Boer settlements in South Africa.

5|$|The Pacific swift (Apus pacificus) is a bird which breeds {{in eastern}} Asia. This swift is {{strongly}} migratory, spending the northern hemisphere's winter in Southeast Asia and Australia.

The sexes are identical in appearance, although young birds can be identified by pale fringes to the wing feathers that are absent in adults. This swift's main call is a screech typical of its family. It is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> closely related Asian swifts formerly regarded as one species.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, heir presumptive to the Austro-Hungarian throne, {{and his wife}} Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg, occurred on 28 June 1914 in Sarajevo when they were mortally wounded by Gavrilo Princip. Princip was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>group</b> <b>of</b> six assassins (five Serbs and one Bosniak) coordinated by Danilo Ilić, a Bosnian Serb {{and a member of}} the Black Hand secret society. The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's South Slav provinces so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia. The assassins' motives were consistent with the movement that later became known as Young Bosnia. The assassination led directly to the First World War when Austria-Hungary subsequently issued an ultimatum to the Kingdom of Serbia, which was partially rejected. Austria-Hungary then declared war, triggering actions leading to war between most European states.|$|E
