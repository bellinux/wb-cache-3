5|$|Internal realism was {{the view}} that, {{although}} {{the world may}} be causally independent of the human mind, {{the structure of the}} world—its division into kinds, individuals and categories—is a function of the human mind, and hence the world is not ontologically independent. The general idea is influenced by Kant's idea of the dependence of <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world on the categories of thought.|$|E

25|$|<b>Our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{appearance}} of Queenborough Castle {{comes from a}} plan in an Elizabethan manuscript preserved at Hatfield House, also from a view by Wenceslaus Hollar (1607-1677) which is now lost but is known from some 18th century copies and impressions. There are also written descriptions, the most detailed being the 1650 report of the Parliamentary Commissioners.|$|E
25|$|The first {{early modern}} humans {{to be found}} in Europe were the Cro-Magnon. During {{the latter half of the}} 20th century, new finds from all over the world, like those quoted above and others, greatly {{expanded}} <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> origin and spread of modern humans. The term Cro-Magnon was sometimes used for all of these, but has now been replaced by the term early modern humans in literature, the term Cro-Magnon now used for finds similar to the original find.|$|E
25|$|Dougga was in {{any case}} an early and {{important}} human settlement. Its urban character {{is evidenced by the}} presence of a necropolis with dolmens, the most ancient archaeological find at Dougga, a sanctuary dedicated to Ba'al Hammon, neo-Punic steles, the mausoleum, architectural fragments and a temple dedicated to Masinissa, the remains of which were found during archaeological excavations. Even though <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city before the Roman conquest remains very limited, recent archaeological finds have revolutionised the image that we had of this period.|$|E

25|$|The {{translation}} of cuneiform documents is quite difficult, {{especially given the}} damaged nature of much source material. Additionally, <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying languages, like Akkadian and Sumerian, have evolved over time, so a translation done now may be quite different than one done in AD 1900. The result {{of all this is}} that there can be honest disagreement what the document really says. Worse yet, many archaeological finds have not yet been published, much less translated. Those held in private collections may never be.|$|E
25|$|Dobie {{states that}} two chapels existed, one at Lainshaw {{and one at}} Chapeltoun, however he may have {{confused}} the term 'attached' which can mean that {{it was on the}} land of or had been endowed by the owner or the Lord of the Barony, rather than necessarily being in close proximity to the castle/house of Lainshaw. If Patersons statement implying that only one chapel existed and that it was at Chapelton is correct, and he was brought up locally, then <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> history of the Chapel of St. Mary is greatly increased.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} reasons why {{underwater}} archaeology can make {{a significant contribution to}} <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past. In the shipwreck field alone, individual shipwrecks can be of significant historical importance either because of the magnitude of loss of life (such as the Titanic) or circumstances of loss (Housatonic was the first vessel in history sunk by an enemy submarine). Shipwrecks such as Mary Rose can also be important for archaeology because they can form a kind of accidental time capsule, preserving an assemblage of human artifacts at the moment in time when the ship was lost.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the history}} commences {{with that of}} the Ionian schools, {{there is no doubt that}} those Ancient Greeks who paid {{attention}} to it were largely indebted to the previous investigations of the Ancient Egyptians and Ancient Phoenicians. Numerical notation's distinctive feature, i.e. symbols having local as well as intrinsic values (arithmetic), implies a state of civilization at the period of its invention. <b>Our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mathematical attainments of these early peoples, to which this section is devoted, is imperfect and the following brief notes be regarded as a summary of the conclusions which seem most probable, and the history of mathematics begins with the symbolic sections.|$|E
25|$|CNES is {{collaborating with}} other space {{agencies}} {{in a number}} of projects. Orbital telescopes such as INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory, XMM-Newton and COROT, and space probes like Mars Express, Venus Express, Cassini-Huygens and Rosetta, operated by the European space agency are revolutionizing <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe and our Solar System. Recent satellites such as Demeter (earthquakes). Joint missions with NASA result in PARASOL and CALIPSO (radiation budget) satellites. Megha-Tropiques Mission is a planned collaborative mission with the Indian Space Agency (ISRO) designed to study the water cycle and radiation dynamics, and assist observation from other satellite platforms.

25|$|We {{can view}} Ω {{as a measure}} of our lack of {{knowledge}} about a system. As an illustration of this idea, consider a set of 100 coins, each of which is either heads up or tails up. The macrostates are specified {{by the total number of}} heads and tails, whereas the microstates are specified by the facings of each individual coin. For the macrostates of 100 heads or 100 tails, there is exactly one possible configuration, so <b>our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> system is complete. At the opposite extreme, the macrostate which gives us the least knowledge about the system consists of 50 heads and 50 tails in any order, for which there are 100,891,344,545,564,193,334,812,497,256 (100 choose 50) ≈ 1029 possible microstates.|$|E

25|$|Byzantine chant manuscripts {{date from}} the 9th century, while lectionaries of biblical {{readings}} in ekphonetic notation (a primitive graphic system designed to indicate the manner of reciting lessons from Scripture) begin about a century earlier and continue in use until the 12th or 13th century. <b>Our</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> older period is derived from Church service books Typika, patristic writings and medieval histories. Scattered examples of hymn texts from the early centuries of Greek Christianity still exist. Some of these employ the metrical schemes of classical Greek poetry; but the change of pronunciation had rendered those meters largely meaningless, and, except when classical forms were imitated, Byzantine hymns of the following centuries are prose-poetry, unrhymed verses of irregular length and accentual patterns.|$|E

Since the war he has demonstrated in an exact and controlled field survey the association between cigarette smoking and the incidence of cancer of the lung, and has been the leader in the development in medicine of the precise experimental methods now used nationally and internationally in the evaluation of new therapeutic and prophylactic agents.|$|E

Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his Republic, he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could castrate all scoundrels and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole harem, and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of Pericles.|$|E
