5|$|Reports on {{the number}} <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> and {{individuals}} vary widely. A survey in 1982 reported 450 plants in five populations, with the largest population comprising 300 plants. In 1988, however, only four populations comprising 300 plants were found; surprisingly, only fifty plants {{could be found in}} the location where a population of 300 had previously been reported; yet there were no dead plants, and no evidence of disturbance. Since then the number <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> reported have ranged from 6 to 11, and reports {{of the total number of}} plants have ranged from 340 to 580.|$|E
5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and bacteria in the laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E

5|$|Banksia aculeata {{has been}} {{reported}} as susceptible to dieback from the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi, but in a 2008 study this pathogen {{was found to have}} no direct impact on the species. As a result of this finding, together with the low percentage <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> infested or facing imminent infestation, the species was classed as having a very low extinction risk.|$|E
5|$|Beetle fossils are {{abundant}} in the Cenozoic; by the Quaternary (up to 1.6 mya), fossil species are identical to living ones, while from the Late Miocene (5.7 mya) the fossils are still so close to modern forms that they are most likely the ancestors of living species. The large oscillations in climate during the Quaternary caused beetles to change their geographic distributions so much that current location gives little clue to the biogeographical history of a species. It is evident that geographic isolation <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> must often have been broken as insects moved {{under the influence of}} changing climate, causing mixing of gene pools, rapid evolution, and extinctions, especially in middle latitudes.|$|E
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} {{have been very}} adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E

5|$|Ecological {{systems are}} studied at several {{different}} levels, from {{the scale of}} the ecology of individual organisms, to those <b>of</b> <b>populations,</b> to the ecosystems and finally the biosphere. The term population biology is often used interchangeably with population ecology, although population biology is more frequently used in the case of diseases, viruses, and microbes, while the term population ecology is more commonly applied to the study of plants and animals. Ecology draws on many subdisciplines.|$|E
5|$|Hybridization {{is greatly}} {{influenced}} by human impact on the environment, through effects such as habitat fragmentation and species introductions. Such impacts {{make it difficult to}} conserve the genetics <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> undergoing introgressive hybridization. Humans have introduced species worldwide to environments for a long time, both intentionally for purposes such as biological control, and unintentionally, as with accidental escapes of individuals. Introductions can drastically affect populations, including through hybridization.|$|E

5|$|Not {{only have}} the {{symbionts}} and specific species been shown to shift, {{but there seems to}} be a certain growth rate favorable to selection. Slower-growing but more heat-tolerant corals have become more common. The changes in temperature and acclimation are complex. Some reefs in current shadows represent a refugium location that will help them adjust to the disparity in the environment even if eventually the temperatures may rise more quickly there than in other locations. This separation <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> by climatic barriers causes a realized niche to shrink greatly in comparison to the old fundamental niche.|$|E
5|$|The fishery {{industry}} {{not only}} threatens marine mammals through by-catch, but also through competition for food. Large scale fisheries {{have led to}} the depletion of fish stocks that are important prey species for marine mammals. Pinnipeds have been especially affected by the direct loss of food supplies and in some cases the harvesting of fish has led to food shortages or dietary deficiencies, starvation of young, and reduced recruitment into the population. As the fish stocks have been depleted, the competition between marine mammals and fisheries has sometimes led to conflict. Large-scale culling <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> of marine mammals by commercial fishers has been initiated {{in a number of areas}} in order to protect fish stocks for human consumption.|$|E
5|$|The most {{sensitive}} enzyme assays use lasers focused through a microscope to observe changes in single enzyme molecules as they catalyse their reactions.

5|$|Threats to B.brownii include loss {{of habitat}} due to land clearing, {{commercial}} exploitation, disease, and {{changes to the}} fire regime. The fragmentation <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> is also of concern, as it causes the genetic diversity of the species to decline, potentially reducing vigour. Climate change is also of concern: depending on the severity of change, the range of this species is predicted to contract by 30% to 50% by 2080.|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s, the Federal {{government}} had reversed its views on wolves. In a controversial {{decision by the}} U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (which oversees threatened and endangered species), northwestern wolves imported from Canada were reintroduced into the park. Reintroduction efforts have been successful with populations remaining relatively stable. A survey conducted in 2005 reported that there were 13 wolf packs, totaling 118 individuals in Yellowstone and 326 in the entire ecosystem. These park figures were lower than those reported in 2004 but may be attributable to wolf migration to other nearby areas {{as suggested by the}} substantial increase in the Montana population during that interval. Almost all the wolves documented were descended from the 66 wolves reintroduced in 1995–96. The recovery <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> throughout the states of Wyoming, Montana and Idaho has been so successful that on February 27, 2008, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service removed the Northern Rocky Mountain wolf population from the endangered species list.|$|E
5|$|C.maenas is a predator, {{feeding on}} many organisms, {{particularly}} bivalve molluscs (such as clams, oysters, and mussels), polychaetes and small crustaceans. They are primarily nocturnal, although activity {{also depends on}} the tide, and crabs can be active {{at any time of}} day. In California, preferential predation of C.maenas on native clams (Nutricola spp.) resulted in the decline of the native clams and an increase of a previously introduced clam (the amethyst gem clam, Gemma gemma). C.maenas has been implicated in the destruction of the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria) fisheries on the east coast of the United States and Canada, and the reduction <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> of other commercially important bivalves (such as scallops, Argopecten irradians, and northern quahogs, Mercenaria mercenaria). The prey of C.maenas includes the young of bivalves and fish, although the effect of its predation on winter flounder, Pseudopleuronectes americanus is minimal. C.maenas can, however, have substantial negative impacts on local commercial and recreational fisheries, by preying on the young of species, such as oysters and the Dungeness crab, or competing with them for resources.|$|E

5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} of the tammar wallaby exists from the late Pleistocene era—remains {{were found in the}} Naracoorte Caves. The mainland and island dwelling tammars split from each other 7,000–15,000 years ago, while the South Australian and Western Australian animals diverged around 50,000 years ago. The tammar wallabies on Flinders Island had greyer coats and thinner heads than the Kangaroo Island tammars, which are larger than the East and West Wallabi Islands animals. The island tammars were once thought to be a separate species from the mainland population. A 1991 examination of tammar skulls from different parts of the species' range found that populations can be divided into three distinct groups; one group made <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> from mainland Western Australia, East and West Wallabi Islands, Garden Island and Middle Island; a second group comprising populations from Flinders Island, 19th century mainland Southern Australia and New Zealand; and a third group consisting solely of the Kangaroo Island population. The Western Australia Department of Environment and Conservation listed these populations as subspecies; M. e. derbianus, M. e. eugenii and M. e. decres respectively.|$|E
5|$|In his 1982 monograph, ornithologist Richard Schodde {{proposed}} a northern origin for the chestnut-shouldered fairywren group {{due to the}} variety of forms {{in the north and}} their absence in the southeast of the continent. Ancestral birds spread south and colonised the southwest during a warm and wetter period around 2 million years ago {{at the end of the}} Pliocene or beginning of the Pleistocene. Subsequent cooler and drier conditions resulted in loss of habitat and fragmentation <b>of</b> <b>populations.</b> Southwestern birds gave rise to what is now the red-winged fairywren, while those in the northwest of the continent became the variegated fairywren. Further warmer, humid conditions again allowed birds to spread southwards; this group, occupying central southern Australia east to the Eyre Peninsula, became the blue-breasted fairywren. Cooler climate after this resulted in this being isolated as well and evolving into a separate species. Finally, after the end of the last glacial period 12,00013,000years ago, the northern variegated forms have again spread southwards. This has resulted in the ranges of all three species overlapping. Further molecular studies may result in this hypothesis being modified.|$|E
5|$|Indirect mutualisms occur {{where the}} organisms live apart. For example, trees {{living in the}} {{equatorial}} regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called commensalism; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or propagules, denying {{the services of a}} beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast. Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red Queen Hypothesis, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency <b>of</b> <b>populations</b> responding to the antagonistic pressure.|$|E
