5|$|Within its {{existing}} residential life programs, Florida Atlantic offers {{a number of}} Learning Communities for freshmen and students with similar interests and concentrations. Participants meet people with similar interests, live on the same floor and take courses with <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> community, while receiving additional guidance related to those interests. The university's Learning Community programs are divided into two categories, Freshman Learning Communities and Living Learning Communities. The freshman program offers 16 different concentrations, including business, nursing, and education. The Living program offers six concentrations for students residing in the Heritage Park Towers dormitory, including engineering, computer science, and a Women's Leadership program.|$|E
5|$|For {{temperate}} living bats, births typically {{take place}} in May or June in the northern hemisphere while births in the southern hemisphere occur in November and December. Tropical species give birth {{at the beginning of}} the rainy season. In most bat species, female carry and give birth to one pup per litter. For bat embryos, apoptosis only affects the hindlimbs, while the forelimbs retain webbing between the digits which form into the wing membranes. At birth, a bat pup can be up to 40 percent of the mother's weight, and hence the pelvic girdle of the female expands during birth as the two halves are connected by a flexible ligament. Females typically give birth in a heads-up or horizontal position, using gravity to make birthing easier. The young emerges rear-first, possibly to prevent the wings from getting tangled, and the females cradles it in her wing and tail membranes. In many species, females give birth and raise their young in maternity colonies and individuals may assist <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> birthing process.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his own puppetry projects, Henson aided <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> work. In 1979, he {{was asked by the}} producers of the Star Wars sequel The Empire Strikes Back to aid make-up artist Stuart Freeborn in the creation and articulation of enigmatic Jedi Master Yoda. Henson suggested to Star Wars creator George Lucas, himself a Muppets fan, that he use Frank Oz as the puppeteer and voice of Yoda. Oz voiced Yoda in The Empire Strikes Back and each of the four subsequent Star Wars films. The naturalistic, lifelike Yoda {{became one of the most}} popular characters of the Star Wars franchise. Lucas even lobbied unsuccessfully to have Oz nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.|$|E

5|$|Angola {{held the}} first round of its 1992 presidential {{election}} on 29–30 September. Dos Santos officially received 49.57% of the vote and Savimbi won 40.6%. As no candidate received 50% or more of the vote, election law dictated a second round of voting between the top two contenders. Savimbi, along with eight opposition parties and many other election observers, said the election had been neither free nor fair. An official observer wrote that there was little UN supervision, that 500,000 UNITA voters were disenfranchised and that there were 100 clandestine polling stations. Savimbi sent Jeremias Chitunda, Vice President of UNITA, to Luanda to negotiate the terms of the second round. The election process broke down on 31 October, when government troops in Luanda attacked UNITA. Civilians, using guns they had received from police a few days earlier, conducted house-by-house raids with the Rapid Intervention Police, killing and detaining hundreds of UNITA supporters. The government took civilians in trucks to the Camama cemetery and Morro da Luz ravine, shot them, and buried them in mass graves. Assailants attacked Chitunda's convoy on 2 November, pulling him out of his car and shooting him and two <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> faces. The MPLA massacred over ten thousand UNITA and FNLA voters nationwide in a few days in what was known as the Halloween Massacre. Savimbi said the election had neither been free nor fair and refused to participate in the second round. He then proceeded to resume armed struggle against the MPLA.|$|E

25|$|The League {{competition}} {{is made up}} of fixtures of fifty overs per side, with each team playing the <b>others</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> division both home and away. The strength of the League and its players is in part assisted by the League management having an open policy on the payment of players and no particular limit on the number of professional players in each game. However, teams are limited to one overseas player. In 2008 some first division sides have fielded as many as six players with professional (first-class) credentials.|$|E
