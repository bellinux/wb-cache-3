25|$|As {{opposed to}} {{broadcasts}} <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> series, CBS broadcast special episodes of its late-night talk shows as its lead-out programs for Super Bowl 50, {{beginning with a}} special live episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert following the game, with a sketch featuring a pre-recorded appearance by Barack Obama, and guests Will Ferrell, Tina Fey, Margot Robbie, and Megyn Kelly. Following a break for late local programming, CBS also aired a special episode of The Late Late Show with James Corden.|$|E
25|$|On October 6, 1986, WCIX {{became a}} charter {{affiliate}} {{of the newly}} launched Fox Broadcasting Company, {{and was one of}} a handful of VHF stations to affiliate with the network, though the station was essentially still independent since Fox offered only an hour of late night programming at the time (consisting of the talk show The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers) and would only add two nights <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> programming by the end of the station's tenure with the network.|$|E

25|$|Prior to CTV's {{purchase}} of the station in 2001, this shifting <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> programming normally extended to the 7:00 ET / 6:00 CT hour on Sundays, {{in line with the}} practice of American broadcast networks. This meant a local newscast would air at 5:30, followed by primetime, then an extra local newscast at 10:00 p.m. Since 2001, CKY has usually aired local news at 6:00 seven nights a week, including Sundays, regardless of the station's ability to simsub at that hour, with programming rescheduled as needed to air within the 7-11 p.m. CT block.|$|E
25|$|Since its launch, MyNetworkTV has {{struggled}} to gain an audience. In 2009, {{it was announced that}} the network would convert to a syndicated programming service, and since SmackDown moved to Syfy in October 2010, MyNetworkTV has been devoid of first-run programming other than that shared with syndicators. In many markets (mainly in smaller and lower-tier mid-sized markets), it now shares channel space with other minor networks such as America One, This TV and MeTV and is more apt to air out of prime time on several affiliates. In September 2015, west coast flagship KCOP-TV in Los Angeles moved MyNetworkTV programming to late night, both replacing it with low-tier entertainment newsmagazines in primetime, and freeing Fox sister station KTTV of any in-house competition in primetime. In Chicago, WPWR-TV moved the lineup to nearly out <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> on September 1, 2016, upon assuming the CW affiliation from WGN-TV.|$|E
25|$|The primetime {{soap operas}} and drama {{series of the}} 1990s, such as Beverly Hills, 90210, Melrose Place, Party of Five, The OC, and Dawson's Creek, focused more on younger characters. In the 2000s, ABC began to revitalize the primetime soap opera format with shows such as Desperate Housewives, Grey's Anatomy, Brothers & Sisters, Ugly Betty, Private Practice, and more {{recently}} Revenge, Nashville, Scandal, Mistresses, and formerly Ringer, which its sister production company ABC Studios co-produced with CBS Television Studios for The CW. While not soaps in the traditional sense, these shows managed to appeal to wide audiences with their high drama mixed with humor, and are soap operas by definition. These successes led to NBC's launching serials, including Heroes and Friday Night Lights. The upstart MyNetworkTV, a sister network of Fox, launched a line <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> telenovelas (a genre similar to soap operas in terms of content) upon its launch in September 2006, but discontinued its use of the format in 2007, after disappointing ratings.|$|E

25|$|Children's {{programming}} {{has played}} a part in NBC's programming since its initial roots in television. NBC's first major children's series, Howdy Doody, debuted in 1947 {{and was one of the}} era's first breakthrough television shows. From the mid-1960s until 1992, the bulk of NBC's children's programming was composed of mainly animated programming including classic Looney Tunes and Woody Woodpecker shorts; reruns <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> animated sitcoms such as The Flintstones and The Jetsons; foreign acquisitions like Astro Boy and Kimba the White Lion; animated adaptions of Punky Brewster, ALF and Star Trek as well as animated vehicles for Gary Coleman and Mr. T; live-action programs like The Banana Splits, The Bugaloos and H.R. Pufnstuf; and the original broadcasts of Gumby, The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show, Underdog, The Smurfs, Alvin and the Chipmunks and Disney's Adventures of the Gummi Bears. From 1984 to 1989, the network aired a series of public service announcements called One to Grow On, which aired after the end credits of every program or every other children's program.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{its status}} as NBC's largest affiliate, KYW-TV {{spent much of the}} next thirty years pre-empting many NBC programs, {{choosing}} to air local or syndicated programming instead. The production arm of Westinghouse Broadcasting was partially responsible for the pre-emptions, as channel 3 (along with its sister stations in the Group W chain) aired shows produced and syndicated by Group W, such as The Mike Douglas Show (whose production moved from Cleveland to the Walnut Street studio Philadelphia in 1965, and then taped at Independence Mall East until 1978), The David Frost Show and Evening Magazine (known as PM Magazine on stations that were not owned by Westinghouse). Pre-empted network programming was usually lower-rated daytime game shows, soap operas or reruns <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> programs with an average of two hours per day. At one point, in the fall of 1980, KYW-TV pre-empted NBC's entire morning schedule after the Today show. Over the years, NBC contracted independent stations WPHL-TV, WTAF-TV/WTXF-TV, WKBS-TV and WGTW-TV to air programs preempted by channel 3. However at the time, NBC was far less tolerant of pre-emptions than the other networks and was rather perturbed at losing valuable advertising in the nation's fourth-largest market.|$|E
25|$|Another {{trend in}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries was that acts from circuses began to find work in {{permanent}} venues that were developing in rapidly growing towns and cities. In the US they found a place in vaudeville and burlesque shows. In Britain the equivalent was music hall. And in both America and Europe, cabaret was another format that sometimes embraced impalement artists. The advent of cinema and later television in the 20th century eventually led to a gradual decline in the venues in which the impalement arts had previously thrived, but a new home {{was created in the}} form of television variety shows. A knife throwing act {{was one of the first}} pieces of entertainment ever broadcast on television. When the BBC started the world's first practical television service with experimental transmissions in 1936 one of the types of programmes it produced were variety shows with circus artists. Those acts, which included the knife throwing Denvers, were thought to be very visual and thus suited to the new medium. Variety later became an important part <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> schedules and remained so for decades.|$|E

50|$|PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service, was in operation, but the {{schedule}} was set by each local station. From February 8 to 24, 1992, all <b>of</b> CBS' <b>primetime</b> programming was preempted {{in favor of}} coverage of the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, and from July 25 to August 9, 1992, all <b>of</b> NBC's <b>primetime</b> programming was preempted in favor of coverage of the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.|$|R
25|$|The {{demand to}} {{broadcast}} Monday Night Football games live across the United States over ABC {{was difficult to}} reconcile with other prime time programming, which is usually set to begin at a certain local time regardless of time zone. On the East Coast, with MNF beginning at 9:00p.m. Eastern Time, there was an hour <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> in which to schedule regular programming. However, on the West Coast, the games lasted from 6:00 to 9:30p.m. Pacific Time (or {{in the case of}} Seattle and Portland from 1970 to 1995, 7:00 to 10:30p.m.), leaving little or no time for additional network programming on Monday. As a result, network programs scheduled for prime time on the East Coast were broadcast at various hours on the West Coast. Most affiliates pushed the network shows to immediately after the game; however, Los Angeles owned-and-operated station KABC-TV postponed them until 10:00p.m. from at least the mid-1990s until 2005 to show trivia contests and other sports shows produced locally (the longest-tenured such show was Monday Night Live, hosted by sports anchor Todd Donoho). Meanwhile, KOMO, one of the stations that tape-delayed MNF in most cases, broadcast new episodes of the sitcom Coach on Saturday afternoons (usually reserved, coincidentally enough, for college football telecasts; much of the series took place on a fictional college campus). Except for Seattle and Portland from 1970 to 1995, ABC World News Tonight was routinely preempted on most West Coast affiliates, though the ABC network-owned stations (e.g. Los Angeles) aired the program earlier in the afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the series}} was indeed {{proving to be a}} hit, its late time slot in the country's largest media market began to concern its distributor. Even though Letterman's show and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson were strong ratings winners and Jeopardy! was able to retain a good amount of the {{audience}} from its lead in shows, a late night time slot is not usually considered beneficial for a first run series. WNBC, however, was not left with much choice in the matter. At the time, the station cleared the NBC daytime lineup in its entirety and aired {{two and a half hours}} of news beginning at 5:00p.m. The only available slots the station had were the 9:00a.m. hour between the end of Today and the beginning of the daytime schedule, the 4:00p.m. hour between the end of the daytime schedule and Live at Five, and the 7:30p.m. slot between the end of NBC Nightly News and the beginning <b>of</b> <b>primetime.</b> Each one of those slots was spoken for, however. The popular Donahue was one of the station's biggest ratings draws in daytime and was not going anywhere (especially considering NBC's New York base was about to become its home), which precluded Jeopardy! from moving there. WNBC, as a network-owned station, had also picked up the syndicated edition of Family Feud when it premiered along with the rest of the stations NBC owned, which took away the 7:30 slot. King World looked for a way out of its unfavorable situation with WNBC, but there was not much to be done. The two other major network affiliates in New York, WABC and WCBS, both had the same issue as WNBC in that both stations cleared their network's schedule completely and had other programming filing the holes in their schedules.|$|E

The pilot episode, titled [...] "", aired on Sunday September 30, 2001 at 9:00p.m. EST. Episodes aired weekly until December, when the show took a brief hiatus until January, and took another hiatus during February. The final episode of the season aired at 9:00p.m. on Friday May 10, 2002. Under a $100,000-per-episode shared or second window syndication agreement that cable channel USA Network made with NBC, USA Network was allowed to broadcast episodes out <b>of</b> <b>primetime</b> a week after their premiere on NBC. The season is also under a regular off-network syndication deal at USA Networks and Bravo. The two channels teamed up late 2004 to pay $2 million per episode for the syndication rights to the series, allowing USA Network to air episodes during the week, and Bravo to air episodes at the weekend. In 2007, Fox Television Stations, a group of Fox Broadcasting Company owned-and-operated stations, entered a syndication deal to broadcast episodes {{as part of its}} daytime schedule. From late 2009, MyNetworkTV will broadcast Law & Order: Criminal Intent, including episodes from season one, having changed their business model from a network broadcaster to a syndication programming service. The series has also been distributed to international broadcasters.
