40|$|Abstract. <b>Webs</b> <b>of</b> trust {{constitute}} a decentralized infrastructure for establishing {{the authenticity of}} the binding between public keys and users and, more generally, trust relationships among users.

Our framework comprises a novel cryptographic protocol based on zero-knowledge proofs, a symbolic abstraction and formal verification of our protocol, and a prototypical implementation based on the OpenPGP standard. The framework is capable of dealing with various core and optional features <b>of</b> common <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> trust, such as key attributes, key expiration dates, existence of multiple certificate chains, and trust measures between different users. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Stabilimenta are silky {{structures}} on the <b>webs</b> <b>of</b> some orb-weaving spiders, whose function {{is still not}} well understood. This study tested the prey-attraction hypothesis as a possible function of stabilimenta with the banded garden spiders Argiope trifasciata in southeastern Michigan. Spider webs’ stabilimentum length, prey interception rates and web characteristics were recorded daily. The daily insect interception rates and web characteristics were compared between stabilimentum-decorated and undecorated webs. An intra-web comparison was performed between decorated and undecorated halves <b>of</b> <b>webs</b> on the daily insect interception rates and web characteristics. The eVects of location and characteristic <b>of</b> <b>webs</b> on insect interception rates were further examined at decorated and undecorated webs. A higher interception rate for flying insects was found in webs decorated with stabilimenta, but orthopteran interception rate was the same when compared with undecorated webs. The decorated web’s higher interception rate for flying insects {{did not seem to}} result from locations or characteristics <b>of</b> <b>webs.</b> The length <b>of</b> a stabilimentum had little eVect on increasing its attractiveness to flying insects. There was no diVerence in flying insect interception rates between decorated and undecorated halves <b>of</b> <b>webs,</b> but orthopteran interception rates were always higher in lower halves <b>of</b> <b>webs.</b> The results from intra-web comparison indicated that a stabilimentum did not increase insect interception rate of th...|$|R
