After {{a few months}} <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> him, Belle asks the dark one why she found children's {{clothing}} upstairs. Rumpelstiltskin tells her it belonged to his son whom he unfortunately lost along with his wife. Gaston arrives to take Belle back but Rumpelstiltskin turns him into a rose and presents it {{to her as a}} gift. When asked about Gaston, Belle says that it was an arranged marriage, not one of love. She left him because she wanted to be heroic and there are not many chances for women to be heroic. Rumpelstiltskin asks Belle to go into town to buy more straw, and she cannot believe he trusts her to come back. Rumpelstiltskin says he does not expect to see her again.|$|E
5|$|From 1999 to 2001 a 40-year-old {{homemaker}} named Debbie Swenson perpetrated a ruse {{under the}} identity Kaycee Nicole, a 19-year-old woman in Kansas who shared {{the details of}} her battles with leukemia online. The Guardian newspaper reported that millions of Internet users read the fictional blog, as well as Swenson's own blog, in which she posed as Kaycee Nicole's mother, describing the trials <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> an intelligent and optimistic daughter who was dying. On May 16, 2001, Kaycee Nicole's death of an aneurysm was announced, shocking her readers and causing them intense grief. Soon however, Swenson caused skepticism in online communities. Although many cards and gifts had been previously sent, she refused to accept more. People began to learn that no one named Kaycee Nicole lived in Kansas, had been enrolled in schools, or admitted to local hospitals, and no obituary had been printed. The photo representing the girl was found to be that of a basketball player from Gracemont, Oklahoma, who was alive. After repeated questioning, Swenson posted that she had woven the stories of three cancer patients to create the character of Kaycee Nicole, who had never existed.|$|E

More {{information}} about the leg- islation and its history {{is available from the}} Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HIV/ AIDS Bureau (HAB) at [URL] ryan-white-hivaids-program/ryan-white-hivaids- program-legislation. For the implementation of the Ryan White HIV/ AIDS Program (RWHAP) Metropolitan (Part A) and State (Part B) programs, HRSA HAB and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collaborate to ensure the appropriate HIV and AIDS surveillance data are used in determining eligibility and funding allocation amounts. In FY 2017, HRSA used total counts <b>of</b> persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed HIV infection non-AIDS and persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> infection ever clas- sified as AIDS to calculate funding allocation amounts for eligible jurisdictions. The number <b>of</b> persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed HIV infection non-AIDS and the number <b>of</b> persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> infection ever classified as AIDS are used to determine funding levels for RWHAP Parts A and B. For FY 2017, CDC provided HRSA with data files containing the total number <b>of</b> persons reported <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed HIV infection non-AIDS and the total number <b>of</b> persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> infection ever classified as AIDS through calendar year 2015 for all jurisdic- tions. The number <b>of</b> persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed HIV infection non-AIDS and the number <b>of</b> persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> infection ever classified as AIDS were added together to arrive at the total number <b>of</b> persons <b>living</b> <b>with</b> diagnosed HIV infection non-AIDS and infection ever classified as AIDS for each eligible area: eligible metropolitan area (EMA), transitional grant area (TGA), emerging community (EC), state, and territory. These totals were used in the RWHAP Parts A and B funding formula calculations. Suggested citation: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

25|$|Initially, Nilsen {{experienced}} domestic contentment with Gallichan; however, {{within a}} year of their moving to Melrose Avenue, the superficial relationship between the two men began to strain. They slept in separate beds, and both began to bring home casual sexual partners. Although Gallichan insisted Nilsen had never been violent towards him, he was regularly berated by Nilsen, and by early 1976, the pair began arguing with increasing frequency. Nilsen later stated that, following a heated argument in May 1977, he had demanded Gallichan leave the residence. (Gallichan was to later inform investigators that he had himself chosen to end the relationship.) Although Nilsen formed brief relationships with several other young men over the following 18 months, none of these relationships lasted more than a few weeks, and none of the individuals expressed any intention <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> Nilsen on a permanent basis.|$|E
25|$|Ethel Margaret Phillips {{was born}} in England in 1876. Phillips had a {{difficult}} upbringing as a young girl. At about the time Phillips was four years old, her mother abandoned her family, taking Phillips’ youngest brother, Herbert, with her. Since Phillips’ father had developed TB, {{it was decided that}} Phillips and her siblings would leave Bridgnorth, a small town in England, and go to live with their grandmother. Spending less than a year at her grandmother's house, Phillips was then sent away to London to attend school. Much of Phillips' childhood was made up <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> unpleasant hosts and being passed from school to school. By age fifteen, Phillips began earning her living through teaching at Rushmore College, a private school located in Kidderminster, Shropshire. Phillips took on various teaching jobs for the next few years, while also continuing her own studies. Phillips passed the Cambridge examination and then became an Associate of the Royal College of Preceptors.|$|E

It is also one of Bulacan's leading financial centers. According to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC), Santa Maria's total bank deposits reached PHP 18.8 billion as of March 2017, this accounts for almost 75% of Eastern Bulacan's total bank deposits. Likewise, Santa Maria is the richest municipality in Bulacan with an assets totaling to PHP 1 billion and revenues reaching an all-time high of PHP 560 million as of the 2016 report from the Commission on Audit (COA).

In her speech at the Western Australian Equal Opportunity Commission Forum, Perth, 10 August 2009, Oscar stated that Aboriginal leaders in the Valley had taken their first steps {{on the path of}} reconstructing their communities but now needed the government to support them:It is a story of colonisation; the threat of losing our cultural authority to manage our societies; and the despair that has come from that disempowerment.It is a story of grief and trauma and the continued pain <b>of</b> <b>living</b> <b>with</b> grog, drug and violence.It is a story that academics and journalists write about us as though we are victims of history that we can do nothing about.
