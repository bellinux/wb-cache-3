40|$|Carbohydrates play {{important}} roles in biological processes. Their function {{is closely related to}} their conformation. In this thesis, conformational studies of carbohydrates by NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics computer simulations are described. The first two papers discuss the anomalous solubility of β-cyclodextrin compared to <b>other</b> <b>cyclodextrins.</b> Time correlation functions revealed flexibility in all cyclodextrins. Molecular dynamics computer simulations showed that the glycosidic linkages were rather rigid and the flexibility was suggested to be macrocyclic. From spatial distribution functions β-cyclodextrin was found to have greater ability to order the surrounding water than the <b>other</b> <b>cyclodextrins.</b> Paper III deals with some of the difficulties of conformational studies. In Paper IV, a new method, Additative Potential Maximum Entropy, APME, is applied to a disaccharide. Conformational distribution functions are derived from NOEs, J-couplings and residual dipolar couplings and calculated from computer simulations. All distribution functions were found to be in good agreement. In papers V and VI oligosaccharides from human milk are studied. Residual dipolar coupling, J-couplings and cross relaxation rates were measured by NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics computer simulations were carried out. Both oligosaccharides showed high flexibility for the β-D-GlcpNAc-(1 → 3) -β-D-Galp linkage...|$|E
40|$|The {{inclusion}} {{properties of}} modified beta-cyclodextrins (trimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin, dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin) towards idebenone {{were compared with}} natural beta-cyclodextrin. The inclusion complexes were prepared by different methods (coprecipitation, kneading, and freeze-drying) and characterized by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffractometry, UV, CD and NMR spectroscopy. The results obtained by CD and NMR spectroscopy indicate a different orientation of idebenone in dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin with respect to <b>other</b> <b>cyclodextrins.</b> Stability constants of the complexes were determined in water at various temperatures and consequently thermodynamic parameters were obtained. All cyclodextrins are able to significantly increase the water solubility of idebenone, particularly dimethyl-beta-cyclodextrin and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin, {{as a result of}} complexation. Consequently, they enhance the dissolution rate of the complexed drug compared to the free drug...|$|E
40|$|Lipophilic {{drugs have}} limited {{solubility}} in phospholipid systems, hence maximum entrapment levels in liposomes {{are known to}} be low. "Drugs-in-cyclodextrin-in-liposome" systems were previously proposed to overcome this drawback but studies were limited to beta CD and HP beta CD. In some cases, <b>other</b> <b>cyclodextrins</b> may be more interesting than beta CD or HPPCD, such as methylated cyclodextrins. However, these cyclodextrins are known to extract lipid components from the lipid membrane, which may destabilize liposomes. We tested the influence of several cyclodextrins (beta CD, gamma CD, Dimeb, Trimeb, Crysmeb, Rameb, HP beta CD and HP gamma CD) on the aqueous solubility of betamethasone by phase solubility diagrams and on the encapsulation efficiency in liposomes. The release kinetics of betamethasone was studied using Franz diffusion cells. We showed that release kinetics are directly correlated with encapsulation efficiency, which is closely related to betamethasone concentration in cyclodextrin complex solution. No liposome destruction was observed, even with the testing of methylated cyclodextrins at the highest concentration (40 mM). This {{can be explained by the}} fact that these cyclodextrins have a higher affinity for betamethasone than for cholesterol. This was proved by the comparison of phase solubility diagrams of both betamethasone and cholesterol. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of enantiomer purity control was perceived in 1960 s after the Thalidomide disaster. Enantiomers can show different pharmacological efficiency, bioavailability and therapeutic indications. Very often only one enantiomer is active, {{while the other}} can have no activity whatsoever, or can even be toxic. Therefore, methods that enable separation and purity evaluation of enantiomers are very important. Most often used techniques are polarimetry, circular dichroism, roentgen diffraction and chiral chromatography. Separation techniques frequently used are high performance liquid chromatography, gas chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis is a very fast and cheap technique. The most often used chiral separators in capillary electrophoresis are ciclodextrins. They are cyclic oligosaharyds, composed of a-D-glucopyranoside units bound together in a ring. Topologically cyclodextrins are represented as toroids with the larger and the smaller openings of the toroid exposing to the solvent secondary and primary hydroxyl groups respectively. The exterior of the toroid is hydrophilic making it water soluble, while the interior is relatively hydrophobic. This enables the cyclodextrin to form inclusion complexes with drug molecules. One of the enantiomers forms stronger interactions with <b>cyclodextrin</b> then the <b>other</b> <b>cyclodextrin,</b> which ensures enantiomer separation. Enantioselective capillary electrophoretic method using cyclodextrins are used in pharmaceutical analysis, cosmetic and food industry, in forensic science and in environmental protection. In pharmaceutical analysis they are used for determination of stereochemical purity, especially when {{it is necessary to}} quantify one of the enanitomers in the presence of large quantity of other stereoisomers...|$|R
40|$|The localized, {{sustained}} {{delivery of}} growth factors for wound healing therapy is actively being explored by gene {{transfer to the}} wound site. Biocompatible matrices such as bovine collagen have demonstrated usefulness in sustaining gene therapy vectors that express growth factors in local sites for tissue repair. Here, new synthetic biocompatible materials are prepared and shown to deliver a protein to cultured cells via {{the use of an}} adenoviral delivery vector. The synthetic construct consists of a linear, β-cyclodextrin-containing polymer and an adamantane-based cross-linking polymer. When the two polymers are combined, they create an extended network by the formation of inclusion complexes between the cyclodextrins and adamantanes. The properties of the network are altered by controlling the polymer molecular weights and the number of adamantanes on the cross-linking polymer, and these modifications and others such as replacement of the β-cyclodextrin (host) and adamantane (guest) with <b>other</b> <b>cyclodextrins</b> (hosts such as α, γ, and substituted members) and inclusion complex forming molecules (guests) provide the ability to rationally design network characteristics. Fibroblasts exposed to these synthetic constructs show proliferation rates and migration patterns similar to those obtained with collagen. Gene delivery (green fluorescent protein) to fibroblasts via the inclusion of adenoviral vectors in the synthetic construct is equivalent to levels observed with collagen. These in vitro results suggest that the synthetic constructs are suitable for in vivo tissue repair applications...|$|E

The efficacy and mechanisms of pharmacological treatments administered immediately after cerebral damage {{are not fully}} known. Sugammadex is a licensed medication. As <b>other</b> <b>cyclodextrins</b> have not passed the necessary phase tests, trade preparations are not available, whereas sugammadex is frequently used in clinical anesthetic practice. Previous studies have not clearly described {{the effects of the}} cyclodextrin family on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) damage. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether sugammadex had a neuroprotective effect against transient global cerebral ischemia. Animals were assigned to control, sham-operated, S 16 and S 100 groups. Transient global cerebral ischemia was induced by 10 -minute occlusion of the bilateral common carotid artery, followed by 24 -hour reperfusion. At the end of the experiment, neurological behavior scoring was performed on the rats, followed by evaluation of histomorphological and biochemical measurements. Sugammadex 16  mg/kg and 100  mg/kg improved neurological outcome, which was associated with reductions in both histological and neurological scores. The hippocampus TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling) and caspase results in the S 16 and S 100 treatment groups were significantly lower than those of the I/R group. Neurological scores in the treated groups were significantly higher than those of the I/R group. The study showed that treatment with 16  mg/kg and 100  mg/kg sugammadex had a neuroprotective effect in a transient global cerebral I/R rat model.

40|$|Formulation {{of local}} {{anaesthetics}} in different dosage forms, including those for oral, parenteral, and topical application have being widely investigated. All of these formulations include local anaesthetics in their salt forms. The lipophilic {{nature of the}} bases of local anaesthetics may influence {{the rate of the}} pharmacological effect. There has been very little research done towards this aspect of local anaesthetics. Prilocaine base and lignocaine base possess greater lipophilicity than their salts. The salt forms undergo dissociation in the body. To maximise the absorption rate lipophilicity plays an important role. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the potential of using prilocaine and lignocaine individually and in combination as bases for parenteral formulations using cyclodextrins as complexing agents. Cyclodextrins are widely used as complexing agents to increase the solubility of poorly soluble drugs. Hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (HPβCD) was the first choice amongst the different cyclodextrins to be evaluated as a solubility enhancer as it does not show nephrotoxicity and is more bio-available compared to <b>other</b> <b>cyclodextrins.</b> Method: Prilocaine base was prepared from its salt and lignocaine base was obtained from Sigma Pharmaceuticals. Solubilities were examined individually and in combination by the phase solubility method and complex formation investigated. The mobile phase used was methanol:water (55 : 45) with phosphate buffer at pH 5. 5. An AL type solubility isotherm was obtained for the influence of HPβCD on the solubilities of prilocaine and lignocaine. Complexation was investigated for both prilocaine and lignocaine to HPβCD by NMR. Results: The measured solubilities of prilocaine and lignocaine individually at 30 % HPβCD from 25 °C to 42 °C were 1. 96 - 7. 91 moles/L and 1. 69 - 4. 55 moles/L respectively. The solubilities in combination were 0. 91 - 3. 68 moles/L for prilocaine and 1. 03 - 8. 35 moles/L for lignocaine respectively. The NMR data suggested that complexation involves the aromatic ring for both prilocaine and lignocaine apart from methene and methyl groups for prilocaine and ethyl amide and aromatic methyl groups for lignocaine...|$|E
40|$|The {{energetics}} of dissociation of bovine insulin in {{aqueous solution}} have been investigated by sensitive dilution microcalorimetry. Cyclodextrins increase dissociation of insulin oligomers {{in a manner consistent}} with their interaction with protein side chains. For example, assuming monomer-dimer equilibrium, in the absence of cycle dextrins the calorimetric dilution data (25 degrees C, pH 2. 5) indicate a dimer dissociation constant (K-diss) of about 12 mu M and an endothermic dissociation enthalpy (Delta H-diss) of + 41 kJ mol(- 1). Addition of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (up to 200 mM) makes dissociation significantly more endothermic (Delta H-diss = 79 kJ mol(- 1)) and reduces the apparent dimer dissociation constant by more than two orders of magnitude (K(diss) approximate to 1. 7 mM). Qualitatively similar results are observed with alpha-cyclodextrin and <b>other</b> beta- <b>cyclodextrin</b> derivatives. Cyclodextrin-induced insulin dissociation is also observed at pH 7. 4...|$|R

Methylated-β-cyclodextrin was obtained by the modified Hawort method and characterized by 1 H NMR and HPLC data. The average degree of substitution was 13. 8. Methylation was done either on C- 2, C- 3, and C- 6 atoms of glucopyranose unit therefore obtained product can be assort as randomly mβCD.

Reactions of dimethoate and simazine with mβCD were entropy-driven while the inclusion complexation of mβCD with the linuron and thiram were driven by both, enthalpy and entropy, as determined by calorimetric measurements. The observed solubility increment of the investigated pesticides in aqueous solution of mβCD, suggests that it can be efficiently used in pesticide solutions formulations and increase their bioavailability, and biodegradability...|$|R
40|$|Cyclic nigerosyl {{nigerose}} (CNN) is a cyclic tetrasaccharide that exhibits properties {{distinct from}} <b>other</b> conventional <b>cyclodextrins.</b> Herein, we demonstrate that treatment of B 16 melanoma with CNN {{results in a}} dose-dependent decrease in melanin synthesis, even under conditions that stimulate melanin synthesis, without significant cytotoxity. The effects of CNN were prolonged for more than 27 days, and were gradually reversed following removal of CNN. Undigested CNN was found to accumulate within B 16 cells at relatively high levels. Further, CNN showed a weak but significant direct inhibitory effect on the enzymatic activity of tyrosinase, suggesting one possible mechanism of hypopigmentation. While a slight reduction in tyrosinase expression was observed, tyrosinase expression was maintained at significant levels, processed into a mature form, and transported to late-stage melanosomes. Immunocytochemical analysis demonstrated that CNN treatment induced drastic morphological changes of Pmel 17 -positive and LAMP- 1 -positive organelles within B 16 cells, suggesting that CNN is a potent organelle modulator. Colocalization of both tyrosinase-positive and LAMP- 1 -positive regions in CNN-treated cells indicated possible degradation of tyrosinase in LAMP- 1 -positive organelles; however, that possibility was ruled out by subsequent inhibition experiments. Taken together, this study opens a new paradigm of functional oligosaccharides, and offers CNN as a novel hypopigmenting molecule and organelle modulator...|$|R

On the <b>other</b> hand, <b>cyclodextrins</b> (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides whose cone-shaped cavity allows formation of noncovalent inclusion complexes with appropriately sized guest molecules, thus modifying guest physical, chemical, and biological properties. Herein, the physicochemical characterization and in vivo ACE inhibition evaluation of seven CAP/CD complexes are reported. The inclusion complexes were prepared by spray-drying, freeze-drying, kneading, or lyophilization methods and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and scanning electron microscopy techniques. In vivo assays compared CAP and CAP/CD complex administration (0. 5 mg kg− 1 or 0. 09 mg kg− 1, n = 4 – 7) to evaluate the ACE inhibition by continuous infusion of angiotensin I (30 ng 50 μL− 1 min− 1) in conscious Wistar rats. The physicochemical analysis demonstrated complete amorphization and complexation between CAP and CDs, indicating the substitution of water molecules inside the CD cavity with CAP. During the infusion of angiotensin I, the administration of all CAP/CD complexes induced a reduction in mean arterial pressure similar to that observed upon CAP administration. The nanoparticles obtained by the kneading method (CAP/α-CD:KM) showed a potent and long-lasting inhibitory activity (∼ 22 hours) on the angiotensin I pressor effect.

40|$|Since 1970 s cyclodextrins (CDs) {{and their}} derivatives, in {{virtue of their}} {{peculiar}} inclusion properties, have been proposed as pharmaceutical excipients and have found application in several marketed products. They are deemed unique products since natural and semi-synthetic CDs can modulate the physical, chemical and biopharmaceutical properties of guest molecules, eventually ameliorating critical drug properties such as water solubility, dissolution rate, stability and bioavailability. In addition, cyclodextrins have been studied as functional excipients in controlled release system. The advances in chemical strategies for CDs derivatization along with the exciting results obtained with site selective colloidal drug carriers, namely liposomes and nanoparticles, has brought to development of targeted cyclodextrins. In latest years, cyclodextrins have been regarded not only as simple functional excipients but rather as multifunctional supramolecular carriers. Two requirements have to fulfil to obtain such targeted CDs: 1. conjugation of targeting moieties on the CD scaffold, without impairing their specific recognition of cellular targets: 2. adequate complexation of the guest molecule {{that have to be}} efficiently transported to the specific disease site. In this chapter, a critical overview {{of some of the most}} interesting approaches aimed at develop targeted cyclodextrins is presented.

40|$|The dansyl-modified dimer 9 {{complexes}} {{strongly with}} the steroidal bile salts. Relative to native -cyclodextrin, the binding of cholate (1 a) and deoxycholate (1 b) salts is especially enhanced. These steroids bind exclusively in a 1 : 1 fashion. For other bile salts (1 c- 1 e) both 1 : 1 and 1 : 2 complexes were observed with stabilities {{similar to those}} of native -cyclodextrin. This indicates that only one cavity is used, with a small contribution from the second. The difference is attributed to the absence of a 12 -hydroxy group in the second group of steroids. Comparison with a dimer that lacks the dansyl moiety (6) shows that this group especially hinders the cooperative binding of 1 a and 1 b. The smaller interference in the binding of the other steroids indicates that self-inclusion of the dansyl moiety hardly occurs. This weak self-inclusion is supported by fluorescence studies.

40|$|Evaporative Light Scattering Detector (ELSD) is {{increasingly}} {{being used in}} LC as a quasi-universal detector {{eliminating the need for}} derivatization of non-absorbing analytes. Its ability to perform quantitation of substances with lack of standard material, since it shows nearly equal response factors for molecules with about equal molecular mass and similar structure formula, is well-established. In the field of pharmaceutical analysis, it has already been proposed as an effective alternative for the determination of, among <b>others,</b> <b>cyclodextrins,</b> polyethylene glycols, products of combinatorial and parallel synthesis and inorganic ions, including sulfates in gentamicin raw material. Aminoglycosides contain one or more aminosugars, such as glucosamine or neosamine, linked by glycoside linkages to a basic (amino or guanidino) 6 -membered carbon ring (eg. streptidine or streptamine). They may be classified as broad spectrum-antibiotics with greater activity against gram-negative than gram-positive bacteria. Various HPLC methods have been proposed for the determination of aminoglycosides but due to the low UV absorptivity and the absence of native fluorescence, pre-column or post-column derivatization is required. HPLC methods with electrospray ionization/ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry, pulsed electrochemical detector and laser-based polarimeter have also been reported. In this study novel HPLC-ELSD methods with Waters C 18 Spherisorb ODS- 2 4. 6 ? 250 mm analytical column were developed and validated for the direct determination of: a) the four major gentamicins, b) neomycin, c) kanamycin A and kanamycin B and d) tobramycin along with the inorganic co-ion (sulfate). No derivatization step was required, and the applicability of the developed methods to various matrices (raw materials, formulations, bacteria culture medium, animal feedings, plasma and urine) was examined. Gentamicin (sulfate) mainly consists of four closely related components designated as C 1, C 1 a, C 2 and C 2 a. The lack of reference standard material makes the direct quantitation of individual components quite difficult, and the chemical analysis is limited to the determination of the relative fraction of each component from the area of the chromatographic peaks (which is influenced by the differences of the absorptivity among the various components derivatives). In this study Multivariate Simplex algorithm was applied for the final optimization of the composition and the flow rate of the mobile phase. Six response variables were evaluated (peak areas, precision, asymmetry, resolution, retention time of the first and the final peak). The algorithm stopped after 16 experiments. Best results were obtained using a mobile phase of H 2 O/MeOH/ACN 990 / 5 / 5 containing 0. 88 ml TFA and 35 mg TCA per liter, in an isocratic mode at a rate of 1. 1 ml/min. After univariate optimization evaporation temperature was selected to be 50 oC and pressure of carrier gas (N 2) 3. 0 bar. Gentamicin components C 1 a, C 2, C 2 a and C 1 are eluted at 4. 6, 5. 9, 7. 1 and 8. 7 min, respectively with asymmetry factor 1. 4 - 2. 0 and good resolution (Rs > 1. 5). Logarithmic calibration curves (from 4 - 7 to 50 - 90 μg/ml) was obtained for each component (r > 0. 999). Limit of detection was ranged from 4 to 7 μg/ml and precision (%RSD, n= 4) 0. 4 - 2. 2. Kanamycin (sulfate), another aminoglycoside antibiotic available at high purity, is eluted at 3. 2 min and it is well-separated from gentamicin C 1 a (R= 1. 6). The equivalence of responses of gentamicin components and kanamycin to ELS detection (proven by t-test) allows the use of kanamycin as standard substance for the direct quantitation of gentamicin components. Also the simultaneous determination of sulfate was feasible (LOD= 1. 4 μg/ml, %RSD= 0. 18, r> 0. 994). The proposed method was applied for the determination of gentamicin in pharmaceutical formulations (injection, eye drops and cream). The only pretreatment step was the appropriate dilution with the mobile phase, except for cream, which a liquid - liquid extraction was required. Dilution experiments revealed the absence of interference from exipients (constant and proportional errors) and recovery from standard addition experiments was ranged from 99 - 102 % and precision (%RSD, n= 3) 1. 4 - 2. 3.

In water, these fibers take on a toroid or truncated cone configuration. In aqueous medium, the exterior surface of cyclodextrins is hydrophilic while the interior core is hydrophobic. This allows for the formation of guest-host relationships with small hydrophobic molecules. McGowan et al., for example, demonstrated that α-cyclodextrin was very effective at solubilizing the free fatty acids that are generated in the colorimetric determination of triglycerides. Shimada et al. have demonstrated that at an oil:water interface α-cyclodextrin “threads” onto fatty acids in a manner analogous to threading beads onto a string. According to these authors, the number of cyclodextrin molecules per fatty acid appears to be dependent upon the length of the fatty acids that are involved. Due to the small pore size it was generally believed that α-cyclodextrin could not form a complex with triglyceride. However, Artiss et al. demonstrated that α-cyclodextrin could complex triglyceride and at ratios that are significantly different from the 1:1 that is typical for dietary fibers. The ratio for α-cyclodextrin is actually closer to 1:9 (fiber:fat ratio).
