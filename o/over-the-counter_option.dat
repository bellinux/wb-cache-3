40|$|Opportunism, either {{governmental}} or private, {{may become}} a powerful deterrent against public-private project financing, especially considering {{the scale of the}} investment in infrastructure. The parties can secure themselves against counterparty opportunism by assigning the investor an exit (put) option and the public agent a bail-out (call) option on the private investor's shares. This paper presents a mechanism for converting natural monopolies into contestable markets using <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>option</b> contracts that combine the stability of long-term contracts and the flexibility of short-term contracts. The exit/bail-out option mechanism reduces entry barriers by streamlining incomplete long-term contracts and avoiding contractual problems related to bounded rationality and opportunism.

Futures and options {{traded on the}} exchange may still be valuable to distant hedgers, but {{only to the extent}} that basis risk is small. Forward contracting allows hedgers to manage risk using a local delivery price, but the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has long banned the sale of off-exchange options, limiting the opportunities available to hedgers. Recently, agricultural trade options (ATOs) have been introduced as <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>option</b> products designed specifically for hedgers. To date, ATOs have found little interest from potential sellers, but the potential demand for these options may be substantial. This study develops a methodology for measuring the potential value of ATOs.

The novelty of our approach is to combine two recent advances of the empirical literature on foreign exchange interventions: (i) drawing on <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>option</b> prices to characterize more precisely the distribution of market expectations; (ii) redefining interventions in terms of events as they tend to come in clusters. Moreover, in order to deal with the features of the data (small sample size, non-standard distribution), we use bootstrap tests. We show that interventions have a significant impact on the mean expectation (the forward rate). The results are more ambiguous for variance. Additionally, we find that the effect of interventions on skewness is significant, robust to different definitions of skewness, and consistent with the direction of interventions. On the contrary, our results clearly show that kurtosis is not affected by interventions. We finally show that: (i) coordination increases effectiveness of interventions; (ii) results are not altered when controlling for other economic and political news...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey on}} {{derivative}} usage and {{financial risk management}} in New Zealand shows that the currency forward is {{the most frequently used}} derivatives in hedging transaction exposure. This paper examines whether forwards performs better than <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>option</b> for a New Zealand exporter in hedging NZD/USD transaction exposure. This research adopts Hsin, Kuo and Lee’s (1994) model of hedging effectiveness which maximizes the exporter’s expected negative exponential utility function to compare and evaluate the ex-ante hedging effectiveness of both forwards and options synthetic forwards. The results show that prior to the 1997 Asian Crisis, forwards are marginally more effective than options synthetic forwards for an ordinary risk-averse exporter to hedge against her/his 1, 3, 6 and 12 -month transaction exposures. However, during and after the 1997 Asian Crisis, options synthetic forwards are more effective than forwards for hedging exposures of 1, 3 and 6 months. The results are robust to the exporter’s degree of absolute risk aversion (JEL G 1, G 11).

40|$|A vast {{literature}} {{on the effects of}} sterilized intervention by the monetary authorities in the foreign exchange markets concludes that intervention systematically moves the spot exchange rate only if it is publicly announced, coordinated across countries, and consistent with the underlying stance of fiscal and monetary policy. Over the past 15 years, researchers have also attempted to determine if intervention has any effects on the dispersion and directionality of market views concerning the future exchange rate. These studies usually focus on the variance around the expected future exchange rate-the second moment. In this paper we demonstrate how to use <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>option</b> prices to recover the risk-neutral probability density function (PDF) for the future exchange rate. Using the yen|dollar exchange rate as an example, we calculate measures of dispersion and directionality, such as variance and skewness, from estimated PDFs to test whether intervention by the Japanese Ministry of Finance during the period 1996 - 2004 had any impact on the higher moments of the exchange rate. We find little or no systematic effect, consistent with the findings of the {{literature on}} the spot rate as: Japanese intervention was not publicly announced prior to August 2000, and since that time only publicly announced after the fact, over the past 10 years rarely coordinated across countries and, in hindsight, probably inconsistent with the underlying stance of monetary policy.

In this paper, we investigate the predictability of surfaces, using extensive time series of implied volatilities from <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>options</b> on eight different currencies, quoted against the Euro. We examine implied volatility surfaces {{in the context}} of predictability through three different models, two that employ parametric specifications to describe the surface and one that decomposes it into latent statistical factors. All examined models are shown to (a) accurately describe the surfaces in-sample, and (b) produce forecasts that are superior to hard-to-beat benchmarks that ignore information about the shape of the surface, in medium- to long-term horizons. We show that these forecasts can support profitable volatility trading strategies in the absence of transaction costs. Comparing across competing models, our results suggest that parametric models, that allow for a more structured description of the surface, are more successful in terms of forecasts’ accuracy and significance of trading profits...|$|R

40|$|A {{framework}} for calibrating a pricing model to a prescribed set of options prices {{quoted in the}} market is presented. Our algorithm yields an arbitrage-free diffusion process that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler relative entropy distance to a prior diffusion. It consists in solving a constrained (minimax) optimal control problem using a finite-difference scheme for a Bellman parabolic equation combined with a gradient-based optimization routine. The number of unknowns to be solved for in the optimization step {{is equal to the}} number of option prices that need to be calibrated, and is independent of the mesh-size used for the scheme. This results in an efficient, non-parametric calibration method that can match an arbitrary number of option prices to any desired degree of accuracy. The algorithm can be used to interpolate, both in strike and expiration date, between implied volatilities of traded options and to price exotics. The stability and qualitative properties of the computed volatility surface are discussed, including the effect of the Bayesian prior on the shape of the surface and on the implied volatility smile/skew. The method is illustrated by calibrating to market prices of Dollar-Deutschmark <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>options</b> and computing interpolated implied-volatility curves.

40|$|Scar {{management}} {{for the prevention}} of excessive scar formation has always been important but never so important as it is today. Optimal management continues to be an enigma for surgeons, and the best modality of treatment has been debated for many years. However, most studies have unfortunately been either retrospective or case report descriptions. Advances in scar management have been hampered by confusing or ambiguous terminology. There is no consensus on what amount of post-traumatic skin scar formation is "normal" and what should be considered "hypertrophic". In the World Health Organization's ICD- 9, there is no diagnostic code for hypertrophic scar - only keloid is listed. Yet the medical and scientific literature distinguishes them as different conditions. This confusion results in inappropriate management of scar formation, and occasionally contributes to decision making related to elective or cosmetic surgery. Our experience suggests that there is no single treatment for scars that is adequate and that clinical judgement is very important when considering treatment and balancing the potential benefits of the various treatments available. The goal of treating scars is to restore functionality, provide relief of symptoms, enhance cosmetics, and prevent recurrence. This article is based on our scientific and clinical experiences and focuses on <b>over-the-counter</b> <b>options</b> to manage keloid and hypertrophic scars...|$|R

In each case, implied volatilities appear to overpredict changes in the true volatility of underlying prices.
