2500|$|A cookery {{book from}} {{northern}} Europe may have originated in Provence. Known from its incipit as Libellus de arte coquinaria, {{it is the}} Codex K version of the Harpestraeng Cookbook, {{which is part of}} a collection of medical papers written by, or belonging to, Dr. Henrik Harpestraeng. [...] It is currently housed in the Royal Library of Copenhagen (Ny samling Nr. 66, 8 vo.). Food historian Dr. Rudolf Grewe proposed a NW Mediterranean origin for this book based on the recipes and their ingredients, such as saffron. [...] Since Harpestraeng studied medicine in Provence, probably at Montpellier, he may have obtained the book during that time. Harpestraeng may have brought the book to Denmark, where he was the physician to King Valdemar II. Codex K {{is believed to have been}} copied into Danish from an earlier Low German original, <b>or</b> <b>copy.</b> <b>This</b> would have happened before 1244, the year Harpestraeng died. If so, Libellus de arte coquinaria is the earliest Western European cookery book, since Apicius' De re coquinaria.|$|E

Mac an Airchinnigh Date: 3 October 1990 Summary Human beings form conceptual models of their world and behave accordingly. I have focused my research on those aspects of conceptual models which are peculiar to the act of computing and with particular reference to the specification, design and development of software which is intended to be executed on a computer. The conceptual models of mathematicians and computing scientists have much in common. I argue that software engineers should develop a similar kind of conceptual model, one which is founded on discrete mathematics and mathematical method. I have identified the central rôle tha...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to my family. ii The objective of this work is to unify an image-centric 2 -D {{view of the world}} and a vision-centric 3 -D view of the world in the context of inbetweening/view interpolation. This is achieved by incorporating epipolar geometry into an existing inbetweening algorithm [8], which is built on a Bayesian framework. Issues include estimation of the fundamental matrix, specification of the new view and how to incorporate the geometry. The resulting hybrid algorithm exploits the geometry by inserting an additional prior, an epipolar constraint prior, into the existing Bayesian framework. When this hybrid algorithm is used to produce new views, the improvement is manifested in better treatment of occlusion. It is expected that, through improving the accuracy of the new view specification and through more experiments in exploitation of the geometry, further improvements could be achieved.

The focus is on two major areas: effective access to lexicographic data and novel types of data. In terms of access, I consider how electronic dictionaries can help in situations when users are unsure about the spelling of the word they want o lookup. Two further issues discussed are efficient entry navigation and access to multi-word expressions. In the second part of the chapter I discuss the degree to which the use of multimedia can benefit electronic dictionaries. This includes audio (recorded or synthesized), static pictorials, as well as animations and videos. Preliminary research indicates that not all of the above may be equally useful for dictionary users...|$|R

40|$|In architecture, design {{ideas are}} {{developed}} as much through interaction as by individuals in isolation. This awareness inspired {{the development of}} a dynamic architectural memory online, an interactiveplatform to share ideas, knowledge and insights among architects/designers in different contexts and atdifferent levels of expertise. User interaction revealed this platform to suffer from at least two thresholds:First of all, consultation during design is impeded by a physical threshold that separates the platformfrom the designeris working environment. Secondly, designers tend to sense a psychological thresholdto share their ideas and insights with others. This paper proposes to cross both thresholds byconnecting the collective platform to a private design space, where designers can feel free to jot downand reflect on their ideas without fear for criticism, compromise <b>or</b> <b>copying.</b> <b>This</b> connection should allowthem to access the platform during the very act of designing, and to regulate to what extent they “giveaway” their own ideas.
