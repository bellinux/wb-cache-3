40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} dynamic fracture toughness and crack propagation velocity of rocks by using Charpy impact test. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiments showed that crack propagation velocity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> depends on impact energy applied to it, and Q (impact energy/crack propagation velocity) correlates with static strengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b> Also, <b>the</b> dynamic fracture toughness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks,</b> which is {{calculated from the}} dynamic fracture energy obtained by using Charpy impact test, was found {{to depend on the}} impact energy applied with it, and correlates with crack propagation velocity and static compression and tensile strengths <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks...</b>|$|R

Some individuals, such as Bernardo de Azevedo da Silva Ramos, have advanced the position that the inscription is of Phoenician origin and possibly proof of pre-Columbian contact from Old World cultures. Alternative theories proposed include that the rock was the site of a Viking colony or that it is connected with suspected UFO activity.|$|E

5|$|These {{features}} {{have made}} Gibraltar a naturally strong defensive position. The isthmus lacks any natural cover, exposing any approaching enemy to opposing fire. The heights <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> form a natural barrier to movement and rocky ledges provide natural platforms for gun batteries. The sheer cliffs {{on the north}} and east sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> block access from those directions and the sea cliffs around {{the southern end of the}} peninsula make landings there difficult, especially if opposed. A single road connects Gibraltar with Spain, and within the territory most roads are narrow and often steep due to the restricted land area. Over the centuries, Gibraltar's successive occupants have built an increasingly complex set of fortifications around, on top of and incorporating the territory's natural features.|$|E

5|$|Two {{types of}} rock {{are found in}} the pass and its vicinity. Quartz {{monzonite}} forms many of the cliffs, while the crags are biotite gneiss.

5|$|Villadarias {{decided to}} send a force of 2,000 men– {{nearly a third of}} his entire army– divided into two groups: an initial force of 500 to seize the heights at night, {{followed}} by a further 1,500 the following daybreak. The first 500 set off at dusk on 11 November, led by a Colonel Figueroa and guided by Simón Susarte. They {{made it to the top}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock,</b> reaching its southernmost peak near where O'Hara's Battery stands today, and descended part-way down the west side where they sheltered overnight in St. Michael's Cave. At daybreak they climbed the Philip II Wall, which extends up the west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock,</b> and killed the English sentries in the lookout point at Middle Hill. A drummer boy bringing food to the lookout saw the invaders and raised the alarm.|$|E
