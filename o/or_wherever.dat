5|$|His {{capital is}} {{believed}} to be somewhere in modern-day Haryana. Prithu used his Kshatriya power to make the earth yield its riches. Hence the earth is called Prithvi, daughter of Prithu. Prithu, by mere fiat of will, created millions of men, elephants, chariots and horses. During his reign, there was no decreptitude, no calamity, no famine, no disease, no agriculture and no mining. Prithu enjoyed popularity amongst his subjects, hence all kings are called Rajas. Cows yielded buckets of rich milk when they were touched. Trees and lotuses always had honey in them. People were healthy and happy and had no fear of thieves or wild animals. Nobody died of accidents. Kusha grass was golden in colour. Fruits were always sweet and ripe and nobody went hungry. People lived in houses or caves or trees <b>or</b> <b>wherever</b> they liked. For the first time, civilization and commerce came into existence.|$|E
25|$|The other {{southern}} states, Mysore State (now Karnataka), Andhra and Kerala, adopted a three-language formula where {{the students would}} be expected to study English, Hindi, and their regional language. While the north was keen on getting the southern curriculum with compulsory Hindi, it was demanded from the south that northern states take on a three-language policy for themselves too, with one of them being a Dravidian language. The northern states either refused to adopt a three-language formula, <b>or</b> <b>wherever</b> a three-language formula was implemented in the north, an option for taking Sanskrit was implemented, defeating the purpose of the policy itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{dead bodies}} were so {{numerous}} that burying {{all of them}} was impossible. The dead were initially weighted down on barges and dumped at sea, but when the gulf currents washed many of the bodies back onto the beach, a new solution was needed. Funeral pyres were {{set up on the}} beaches, <b>or</b> <b>wherever</b> dead bodies were found, and burned day and night for several weeks after the storm. The authorities passed out free whiskey to sustain the distraught men conscripted for the gruesome work of collecting and burning the dead. More people were killed in this single storm than the total of those killed in all the tropical cyclones that have struck the United States since. This count is greater than 300 cyclones, as of 2009. The Galveston Hurricane of 1900 remains the deadliest natural disaster in U.S. history.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} First Crusade, land was {{distributed}} to loyal vassals of Godfrey, forming numerous feudal lordships within the kingdom. This was continued by Godfrey's successors. The number {{and importance of}} the lordships varied throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and many cities {{were part of the}} royal domain. The king was assisted by a number of officers of state. The king and the royal court were normally located in Jerusalem, but due to the prohibition on Muslim inhabitants, the capital was small and underpopulated. The king just as often held court at Acre, Nablus, Tyre, <b>or</b> <b>wherever</b> else he happened to be. In Jerusalem, the royal family lived firstly on the Temple Mount, before the foundation of the Knights Templar, and later in the palace complex surrounding the Tower of David; there was another palace complex in Acre.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of the Master of the Revels was to supervise the arrangements for entertainments presented at court, at the various royal residences <b>or</b> <b>wherever</b> the monarch was in attendance, and to censor plays before they were performed in public theatres. Buck was thus responsible for censoring, among other works, Shakespeare's later plays, and for supervising performances of them and of any earlier Shakespeare plays revived for court performance, which he had to re-censor, due to the regulations added against blasphemy in 1606. Buck noted on the title page of the play George-a-Greene, the Pinner of Wakefield that he had discussed its authorship with Shakespeare. Censorship was exercised in matters of profanity and in sensitive issues of religion and politics, particularly the portrayal of royalty. Judging from his notes in the two manuscript play scripts that show his hand, The Second Maiden's Tragedy (1611) and John van Olden Barnavelt (1619), Buck was conscientious and learned, but gentle in his censorship.|$|E
25|$|Madame Patti has {{practically}} {{opened the}} Severn Tunnel… It {{is true that}} very few people knew it, and perhaps Madame Patti herself did not know it, but everybody {{will be talking about}} it to everybody else. The facts are these. On Sunday Madame Patti and party—a large one—wanted to get from London to Neath with comfort and speed. A special train was arranged for, and the great songstress paid for it out of her own pocket, <b>or</b> <b>wherever</b> she keeps the great piles of money she has made. Many people will be interested to know that the special train ran along the new route through the Severn Tunnel, and that the whole distance from Paddington to Neath was comfortably traversed in four hours and twelve minutes. This was the first through train from London to South Wales via Bristol and the Severn Tunnel, and Madame Patti chartered it, rode in it, and paid for it, and therefore she has the honour of having opened the Severn Tunnel route to London.|$|E

500|$|Drummer Felix Martin said Made in the Dark was a [...] "true group effort".

500|$|At her death, Barbauld was lauded in the Newcastle Magazine as [...] "unquestionably {{the first}} [...] of our female poets, {{and one of}} the most eloquent and {{powerful}} of our prose writers" [...] and the Imperial Magazine declared [...] "so long as letters shall be cultivated in Britain, <b>or</b> <b>wherever</b> the English language shall be known, so long will the name of this lady be respected." [...] She was favourably compared to both Joseph Addison and Samuel Johnson, no mean feat for a woman writer in the eighteenth century. By 1925 she was remembered only as a moralising writer for children, if that. It was not until the advent of feminist literary criticism within the academy in the 1970s and 1980s that Barbauld finally began to be included in literary history.|$|E
500|$|The {{service was}} usually held somewhere near London. [...] This {{was done to}} suit the monarch's convenience: [...] in medieval times, it was held in Windsor, Eton, Richmond, Greenwich, <b>or</b> <b>wherever</b> the monarch {{happened}} to be at Eastertime. [...] In 1714, with the monarch no longer present at the ceremony, the service {{was moved to the}} Chapel Royal, Whitehall, where it remained until 1890, when the Chapel was given to the Royal United Services Institute. [...] After 1890, by order of Queen Victoria, it was moved to Westminster Abbey, though in years when there was a coronation and the Abbey was closed for preparations, the service was held at St. Paul's Cathedral. [...] From 1954 to 1970, it was held in even-numbered years at Westminster, and in odd-numbered years at provincial cathedrals; since then it has, in most years, been held outside London. [...] When the service was confined to London, recipients were customarily householders who had met their financial obligations to society, but had since fallen on hard times.|$|E
500|$|This is {{followed}} by [...] "Pretty as a Swastika", a [...] "mosh pit-ready" [...] heavy metal song. Manson described {{it as one of}} his proudest moments lyrically. According to Manson, its title was [...] "something I said to a girl because of her complexion—with black hair, red lips and pale skin. I mean, it was a complex and poetic statement which soon led to intercourse, so I felt no reason for it to be seen as hateful or destructive." [...] At the insistence of Interscope Records, the song was re-titled on the album's back cover. Manson was critical of this censorship, saying: [...] "Rather than take it off the album, I decided to produce it on the sleeve with a different name, so it'll be sold in Walmart <b>or</b> <b>wherever</b> stores sell guns but are afraid to deal with lyrics. So I put [...] "Pretty as a ($)", because all of their motivations are based on money." [...] "Leave a Scar" [...] was written by Manson [...] "about and for Evan on the day we broke up. Maybe some of the things I say in the song are cruel, but it is how I felt at the time." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 20, 2012, a remix of {{the song}} {{featuring}} a rap verse from American rapper T.I. was released online. His rap appears at the {{three and a half}} minute mark {{of the song}} as he sings about [...] "how he loves it when his lady gives it to him dirty when no one is around" [...] and [...] "lives out his fantasy with candlelight (for a little ambiance), lingerie and Louis Vuitton". He later adds, [...] "I just want to watch the moon glisten off your body... I really just want to peel you out dem clothes and show you how excited I am to lay you down right now." [...] The remix was well received by music critics. A writer of Vibe magazine commented that it [...] "is sultry and will steam up any club, bedroom <b>or</b> <b>wherever</b> you like to get dirty". A writer of Rap-Up magazine described the remix as [...] "amazing", adding that [...] "he bedroom will be banging to this remix". Similarly, X.

500|$|For {{the first}} couple of months, they were merely [...] "killing time", {{according}} to Robertson, with many early sessions devoted to covers. [...] "With the covers Bob was educating us a little", recalls Robertson. [...] "The whole folkie thing was still very questionable to us—it wasn't the train we came in on. ... He'd come up with something like 'Royal Canal', and you'd say, 'This is so beautiful! The expression!' ... He remembered too much, remembered too many songs too well. He'd come over to Big Pink, <b>or</b> <b>wherever</b> we were, and pull out some old song—and he'd prepped for this. He'd practiced this, and then come out here, to show us." [...] Songs recorded at the early sessions included material written or made popular by Johnny Cash, Ian & Sylvia, John Lee Hooker, Hank Williams and Eric Von Schmidt, as well as traditional songs and standards. Linking all the recordings, both new material and old, {{is the way in which}} Dylan re-engaged with traditional American music. Biographer Barney Hoskyns observed that both the seclusion of Woodstock and the discipline and sense of tradition in The Hawks' musicianship were just what Dylan needed after the [...] "globe-trotting psychosis" [...] of the 1965–66 tour. Continued recording at the Big Pink was impossible because of the fanbase that had built up around Dylan. He even reported finding a couple in his bed once.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the female}} protagonists {{challenge}} their male [...] "suitors" [...] {{to keep up}} instead of being full of empty promises; the women further feel that [...] "He's not fulfilling you like he says". Williams further explained {{the meaning of the}} song during an interview with MTV News, [...] "We've had experiences with men doing a lot of talking but they can’t back it up. You said you could do this, but you can't, whether that's on the dance floor <b>or</b> <b>wherever</b> else. He said what he could do for you, but..." [...] The lyrics are constructed in the chorus-verse pattern. The song opens with the lines [...] "Hit me" [...] and the first verses sung by Beyoncé follow: [...] "I put it right there made it easy for you to get to / Now you want to act like you don't know what to do". The chorus follows during which the group repeatedly sings the lines [...] "Can you keep up?". Rowland's second verses follow where she sings the lines [...] "Put it on me deep in the right direction". The chorus is repeated twice before the bridge by Williams. After the bridge, the group sings the lines [...] "Here's your papers, baby you are dismissed" [...] letting their man know that he is not good enough for them. Rowland sings a short ad lib, and then the trio ends with a repeated chorus. Nick Reynolds from BBC compared the song Missy Elliott's [...] "Pass That Dutch" [...] and to songs by The Supremes. He further found a name check of Public Enemy's [...] "Bring the Noise". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine also compared [...] "Lose My Breath with [...] "Pass That Dutch".|$|E
