2500|$|The Jewish elders then {{captured}} Joseph, {{and imprisoned}} him, {{and placed a}} seal {{on the door to}} his cell after first posting a guard.

2500|$|He next assures {{them that}} God has chosen them {{to punish the}} Scots: [...] "This [...]. has been brought about by Divine Providence; in order {{that those who have}} in this country {{violated}} the temples of God, stained the altars with blood, slain his priests, spared neither children nor pregnant women, may on the same spot receive the condign punishment of their crimes; and this most just resolve of the Divine will, God will this day put in execution by means <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands.</b> Arouse your spirits then, ye civilized warriors, and, firmly relying on the valour of your country, nay, rather on the presence of God, arise against these most unrighteous foes" ...|$|E

[...] It has also been reported that Fiasco had initially recorded B.o.B's [...] "Nothin' on You" [...] as well as [...] "Airplanes" [...] featuring Hayley Williams, but both songs had been rejected by Fiasco's label. Another unreleased song from Lasers was [...] "Who Are You Now" [...] featuring B.o.B, which has leaked onto the internet in March 2011.|$|E

2500|$|While most Wufuxu {{methods for}} {{expelling}} the Three Worms involve anthelmintic herbs, a few do not. For instance, a recipe {{attributed to the}} Han Daoist Lezichang 樂子長 (tr. Yamada 1989: 107) says, [...] "Pluck peach leaves {{on the third day}} of the third month; crush them to extract seven pints of juice. Then mix in liquor and heat it five or six times. Take it before meals and the three worms will be driven out." [...] One anomalous Wufuxu method does not mention either medicinal herbs or diet. [...] "The Recipe of Master Redpine" [...] (tr. Yamada 1989: 107) says, [...] "When you cut the nails <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> and feet on the sixteenth day of the seventh month, you can drive out the three worms from your intestines." [...] Arthur (2013: 88) reasons that [...] cutting one's nails for cleanliness might help a person to avoid future parasite infestations but not existing ones, perhaps Master Redpine was referring to the Ghost Festival that is held on the full moon of the seventh lunar month.|$|E
