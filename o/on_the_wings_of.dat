5|$|Intensity of {{precipitation}} is primarily measured for meteorological concerns. However, {{it can be}} of concern to aviation as heavy precipitation can limit visibility. Also, intensity of freezing rain can determine how hazardous it is for pilots to fly nearby certain locations since {{it can be an}} in-flight hazard by depositing ice <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> aircraft, which can be detrimental to flight.|$|E
5|$|White-nose {{syndrome}} (WNS) is {{an emerging}} disease in North American bats which by 2012 {{was associated with}} at least 5-7 million bat deaths. The condition is named for a distinctive fungal growth around the muzzles and <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> hibernating bats and was first identified from a February 2006 photo taken in a cave in Schoharie County, New York.|$|E

5|$|Magnetic Airborne Detection (MAD) {{was used}} to detect {{submerged}} U-boats. It consisted of a sensitive magnetometer installed in the cone of the aircraft (mostly Catalinas) that could detect anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field within a range of 400 feet and was sensitive to detect a submarine to within a few feet. The mine was {{used in conjunction with}} a 65.5lb retro bomb. It was filled with 25lb of Torpex and the weapon was rocket propelled backwards to the line of flight at a speed that counteracted the aircraft's forward motion. It was released rearwards from rails <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft. Thus, with the aircraft's forward motion cancelled-out by the rocket motor, the device fell directly onto the target.|$|E

25|$|A droop or droop nose {{is a type}} of {{high-lift}} device found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> some aircraft. Droops {{are similar}} to leading-edge slats, but with the difference that the entire leading edge section rotates downwards, whereas a slat is a panel that moves away from a wing leading edge when it is deployed.|$|E
25|$|Some small {{insects are}} thought to have evolved an {{appearance}} or behavioural traits that resemble those of jumping spiders and this is suspected to prevent their predation, specifically from jumping spiders. Some examples appear to be provided by patterns <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> some tephritid flies, nymph of a fulgorid and possibly some moths.|$|E
25|$|Klee-Stengeln ("clover-stems") are {{the pair}} of long-stemmed trefoil-type charges <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> 13th-century German depictions of the heraldic eagle. They {{represent}} the upper edge of the wings and are normally Or (yellow), like the beak and claws. Reinmar von Zweter fashioned the Klee-Stengeln of his eagle into a second and third head.|$|E

25|$|Scripted by Brent Friedman, it is a four-part story arc {{focusing}} on a ragtag unit of clone commandos of the same name. The arc was subsequently released on StarWars.com for free shortly after on April 29, 2015. The four episodes were titled: The Bad Batch, A Distant Echo, <b>On</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wings</b> <b>Of</b> Keeradaks, and Unfinished Business.|$|E
25|$|The medal is {{a silver}} cross, 60mm high and 54mm wide, {{representing}} aircraft propeller blades, with wings between the arms. The obverse depicts Hermes, riding <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> a hawk holding a laurel wreath. At {{the top of}} the upper arm is the royal crown, while the other three arms bear the royal cypher of the reigning monarch at the time of issue.|$|E

25|$|Standard had {{introduced}} a new badge in 1947 for their own models, first seen on the Vanguard, a highly stylised motif based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> a Griffin. With {{the introduction of the}} TR2, a version of this badge appeared {{for the first time on}} the bonnet of a production Triumph, while the Globe continued to appear on the hubcaps. This same double-badging also appeared on the TR3 and TR4, the 2000 and the 1300.|$|E
25|$|Amigo Airsho {{is one of}} El Paso's premier events, and {{is ranked}} {{as one of the}} top ten air shows in the country. The show is filled with air {{entertainment}} and ground activities. Acts include the Franklin's Flying Circus, where performers walk <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> an airborne plane. Ground activities include the Jet Powered School Bus. After 31 years of being held at Biggs Army Airfield, the show was moved to Dona Ana Airport in 2014.|$|E
25|$|The {{release of}} pheromones by the male gulf fritillaries plays a {{critical}} role in the mating and courtship process. Studies have shown that the males possess specific structures on their dorsal wings that engage in the production and eventual release of chemical pheromones. It is likely that pores that exist <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the male butterflies transport the pheromones to the surface where the chemicals can be released and can then affect the females. The use of pheromones in the mating process relates to the idea of mate choice.|$|E

25|$|For the Allies, {{probably}} the Ottoman's most dangerous weapon were their fireships. These {{had long been}} deployed to devastating effect by the Greek revolutionaries against the Ottomans, who had learnt {{how to use them}} through hard experience. Fireships were posted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the Ottoman formation, and could, if effectively deployed, wreak mayhem on Allied boats concentrated in enclosed waters, especially as Allied sailors had no experience of this kind of warfare. The danger was graphically demonstrated in the early phase of the battle, when the French ship of the line Scipion narrowly escaped being destroyed by a fireship.|$|E
25|$|Following the war, the United States Army Air Service {{experimented with}} the concept of having troops carried <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> {{aircraft}} pulled off by the opening of their parachutes. The first true paratroop drop was by Italy in November 1927. Within a few years several battalions had been raised and were eventually formed into two Folgore and Nembo divisions. Although these would later fight with distinction in World War II, the divisions were never used in a parachute drop. Men drawn from the Italian parachute forces were dropped in a special forces operation in North Africa in 1943 in an attempt to destroy parked aircraft of the United States Army Air Forces.|$|E
25|$|The 4–1–3–2 is a {{variation}} of the 4–1–2–1–2 and features a strong and talented defensive centre midfielder. This allows the remaining three midfielders to play farther forward and more aggressively, and also allows them to pass back to their defensive mid when setting up a play or recovering from a counterattack. The 4–1–3–2 gives a strong presence in the forward middle of the pitch and is considered to be an attacking formation. Opposing teams with fast wingers and strong passing abilities can try to overwhelm the 4–1–3–2 with fast attacks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wings</b> <b>of</b> the pitch before the three offensive midfielders can fall back to help their defensive line. Valeriy Lobanovskiy {{is one of the most}} famous exponents of the formation, using it with Dynamo Kyiv, winning three European trophies in the process. Another example of the 4–1–3–2 in use was the England national team at the 1966 World Cup, managed by Alf Ramsey.|$|E
