5000|$|The <b>Ocean</b> <b>Nourishment</b> Corporation claimed, [...] "One <b>Ocean</b> <b>Nourishment</b> {{plant will}} remove {{approximately}} 5-8 million tonnes of CO2 {{from the atmosphere}} for each year of operation, equivalent to offsetting annual emissions from a typical 1200 MW coal-fired power station or the short-term sequestration from one million hectares of new growth forest".|$|E
60|$|Beginning {{to recover}} his temper at about this point, Mr. Goodchild voluntarily {{reported}} {{that if you}} wanted to be primitive, you could be primitive here, and that {{if you wanted to}} be idle, you could be idle here. In the course of some days, he added, that there were three fishing-boats, but no rigging, and that there were plenty of fishermen who never fished. That they got their living entirely by looking at the <b>ocean.</b> What <b>nourishment</b> they looked out of it to support their strength, he couldn't say; but, he supposed it was some sort of Iodine. The place was full of their children, who were always upside down on the public buildings (two small bridges over the brook), and always hurting themselves or one another, so that their wailings made more continual noise in the air than could have been got in a busy place. The houses people lodged in, were nowhere in particular, and were in capital accordance with the beach; being all more or less cracked and damaged as its shells were, and all empty--as its shells were. Among them, was an edifice of destitute appearance, with a number of wall-eyed windows in it, looking desperately out to Scotland as if for help, which said it was a Bazaar (and it ought to know), and where you might buy anything you wanted--supposing what you wanted, was a little camp-stool or a child's wheelbarrow. The brook crawled or stopped between the houses and the sea, and the donkey was always running away, and when he got into the brook he was pelted out with stones, which never hit him, and which always hit some of the children who were upside down on the public buildings, and made their lamentations louder. This donkey was the public excitement of Allonby, and was probably supported at the public expense.|$|R

50|$|International law {{presents}} some dilemmas for ocean fertilization. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC 1992) {{has accepted}} mitigation actions. However, the UNFCCC and its revisions recognise only forestation and reforestation projects as carbon sinks. Commercial {{companies such as}} Climos and GreenSea Ventures and the Australian-based <b>Ocean</b> <b>Nourishment</b> Corporation, planned to engage in fertilization projects. These companies invited green co-sponsors to finance their activities in return for provision of carbon credits to offset investors’ CO2 emissions.|$|E
5000|$|Because of the {{relatively}} long residence time of the ocean's thermohaline circulation, carbon transported as marine snow into the deep ocean by the biological pump can remain out of contact with the atmosphere for more than 1000 years. That is, when the marine snow is finally decomposed to inorganic nutrients and dissolved carbon dioxide, these are effectively isolated from the surface ocean for relatively long time-scales related to ocean circulation. Consequently, enhancing the quantity of marine snow that reaches the deep ocean {{is the basis of}} several geoengineering schemes to enhance carbon sequestration by the ocean. <b>Ocean</b> <b>nourishment</b> and iron fertilisation seek to boost the production of organic material in the surface ocean, with a concomitant rise in marine snow reaching the deep ocean. [...] These efforts have not yet produced a sustainable fertilization that effectively transports carbon out of the system.|$|E

The engineering challenges are to inject the nutrients so that they diffuse to an appropriate concentration while being consumed by phytoplankton. Ship based supply of nutrients from onshore manufacture is assumed. Broadcasting granular material onto the surface of the ocean is examined. The depth over which the prills or grains dissolve can be controlled by the diameter and density of the particles. Design considerations are discussed.

40|$|Our review {{identified}} 86 alien marine species, within 13 phyla, having high {{negative or}} {{positive impact on}} ecosystem services and biodiversity in European seas, classified the mechanisms of impact, commented on the methods applied for assessing the impact and the related inferential strength, and reported on information gaps. Food provision was the ecosystem service impacted by {{the greatest number of}} alien species, positively or negatively. Following food provision, the ecosystem services being negatively affected by the highest number of alien species were <b>ocean</b> <b>nourishment,</b> recreation and tourism, and lifecycle maintenance, while the ecosystem services that were most often positively impacted were cognitive benefits, water purification, and climate regulation. In many cases, marine aliens were found to negatively affect keystone/protected species and habitats. Thirty percent of the assessed species had an impact on entire ecosystem processes or wider ecosystem functioning, more often in a negative way. Forty-nine of the assessed species were reported as being ecosystem engineers, fundamentally modifying, creating or defining habitats by altering their physical or chemical properties. The positive impacts of alien species are probably underestimated, mainly due to a perception bias against alien species. Among the species herein assessed as high-impact species, 17 had only negative and 7 only positive impacts; for the majority (62 species), both negative and positive impacts were reported, the overall balance being often unknown. Although without doubts, invasive species have modified marine ecosystems, evidence for most of the reported impacts is weak, being based on expert judgement or dubious correlations, while only 13 % of the reported impacts were inferred via manipulative or natural experiments.

40|$|A good {{understanding}} of the mechanisms and magnitude of impact of invasive alien species on ecosystem services and biodiversity {{is a prerequisite for}} efficient prioritization of actions for prevention of new invasions or for mitigation measures. In this review, we have identified marine alien species of high-impact on ecosystem services and biodiversity in the European seas, classified the mechanisms of impact, commented on the methods applied for assessing impact and the related inferential strength, and reported gaps in available information. Furthermore, we have proposed an updated inventory of 86 marine species in Europe, representing 12 phyla, with documented high impact on ecosystem services or biodiversity. Food provision was the ecosystem service that was impacted by the highest number of alien species (in terms of both positive and negative impacts). Following food provision, the ecosystem services that were negatively affected by the highest number of species were <b>ocean</b> <b>nourishment,</b> recreation and tourism, and water purification, while the ecosystem services that were more often positively impacted were water purification, cognitive benefits, and climate regulation. In many cases, marine aliens impact keystone/protected species and habitats. Almost 30 % of the assessed species affected entire ecosystem processes or wider ecosystem function, more often in a negative way. Fifty of the assessed species have been reported to be ecosystem engineers, fundamentally modifying, creating or defining habitats by altering their physical or chemical properties. Positive impacts of alien species are probably underestimated, as there is a persistent perception bias against alien species. We conclude that the “native good, alien bad” philosophy is a misconception and the role of most of the alien species in marine ecosystems is rather complex. Among the species herein assessed as high-impact species, 15 had only negative and 8 only positive impacts; for the majority (64 species) both negative and positive impacts have been reported, and the overall balance is often unknown. Although {{there is no doubt that}} invasive species have modified marine ecosystems, evidence for most of the reported impacts is weak, as it is based on expert judgement or dubious correlations, while only ~ 10 % of the reported impacts were inferred via manipulative or natural experiments. A need for stronger inference is evident, to improve our knowledge base of marine biological invasions and better inform managers. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|E
