500|$|At 13:32, {{during the}} zig-zag, it became {{apparent}} that Queen Mary would come too close to the cruiser and the liner's officer of the watch interrupted the turn to avoid Curacoa. Upon hearing this command, Illingworth told his officer to: [...] "Carry on with the zig-zag. These chaps are used to escorting; they will keep <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> and won't interfere with you." [...] At 14:04, Queen Mary started the starboard turn from a position slightly behind the cruiser and at a distance of two cables (about [...] ). Boutwood perceived the danger, but the distance was too close for either of the hard turns ordered for each ship to make any difference at the speeds that they were travelling. Queen Mary struck Curacoa amidships at full speed, cutting the cruiser in half. The aft end sank almost immediately, {{but the rest of the}} ship stayed on the surface a few minutes longer.|$|E
500|$|... "Quick Sand" [...] is a {{shuffling}} rock {{song that}} addresses the plight of illegal immigrants to Arizona. It depicts six migrants travelling through extreme climates in the Sonoran Desert to reach Devil's Highway {{in an attempt to}} cross the Mexico – United States border. They journey from Tamaulipas and through the mountains along Devil's Highway. Partway into the journey, the migrants are abandoned by their coyote guide and subsequently lose one another one by one. They experience thirst, hunger, injury, and fear, culminating with the only two surviving migrants being turned away by a vigilante at the border. Cooder said of the route's background and the narrative in an interview, [...] "t's been a migrant trail for 200 years. People go out there and try to do it on foot, but if you make one mistake and go five minutes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>way,</b> you become disorientated and dehydrated. And they find these mummified bodies out there. The heat has just baked them through. And the people who live through it often refer to having a vision of the Virgin of Guadalupe flying overhead. This is a very common vision when the dehydration sets in." ...|$|E
2500|$|That such {{a letter}} was a fiction was {{demonstrated}} very soon after; when Stephen asked Desiderius to fulfil the promises {{he had made}} over the body of Saint Peter, the Lombard king responded: ”Be content that I removed Christophorus and Sergius, who were ruling you, <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>way,</b> and ask not for rights. Besides, if I do not continue to help you, great trouble will befall you. For Carloman, king of the Franks, is the friend of Christophorus and Sergius, and will be wishful to come to Rome and seize you.” ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 2001, Zhang was {{transferred}} to the eastern coastal province of Shandong to become governor. He began serving as provincial party chief, the first-in-charge of the province, beginning in 2002. In Shandong, Zhang told a gathering of assembled local officials, [...] "whether it is my relatives, children, friends; if they go to where you are, please do not go <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> <b>way</b> to receive them, do not curry favour with them, and do not offer to do things for them." [...] This was seen as Zhang trying to send a signal that he intended to distance himself from a political culture rife with corruption and complex rules around guanxi. In Shandong, Zhang was known to conduct 'undercover visits' to survey the lives of ordinary people. When Zhang left office, Shandong's GDP had exceeded 2 trillion yuan (~$300 billion), ranking second among provinces in the country.|$|E

5000|$|Mark Olsen of Los Angeles Times {{had a more}} mixed reaction, saying, [...] "There is so {{much about}} its package - the stars, the premise, the talented {{supporting}} cast - that would make for a film of warmth, humor and insight on the struggles of leaving the past behind and getting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own <b>way</b> {{on the path to}} fulfilment.

"Turns {{out that}} the art <b>of</b> getting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own <b>way,</b> so that you sound on paper like your own true self, is hard work, and it’s {{achieved}} by mastering {{of a bunch of}} disciplines. As in yoga or meditation, the purpose of the rules is not mastery of the rules. The purpose is to free yourself and your writing - from distraction and chatter and banality and superficiality. What you can teach, what no writer can do without learning, are the technical matters that have their equivalent in other human arts and sports and pursuits: sentence craft, the things White and Hemingway and Kenyon taught me; grammar and punctuation; the ageless elements of style; and in poetry several thousand years of wisdom about prosody and form, metaphor and meter, sense and sensibility and the music of speech." ...|$|R
6000|$|Now frankly Socialism will be {{incompatible}} with this patrician style. You must contemplate {{the end of}} all that. You may still be healthy, refined, free, beautifully clothed and housed; but you will not have either the space or the service or the sense of superiority you enjoy now, under Socialism. You would have to take your place among the multitude again. Only a moiety <b>of</b> <b>your</b> property will remain to <b>your</b> sort <b>of</b> person if any revolution is achieved. The rents upon which you live, the investments that yield the income that makes the employment of that army of butlers and footmen, estate workers and underlings possible, that buys your dresses, your jewels, your motorcars, your splendid furnishings and equipments, will for the most part be public property, yielding revenue to some national or municipal treasury. You will have to give up much of that. There is no <b>way</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it, <b>your</b> <b>way</b> to Socialism is through [...] "the needle's eye." [...] From your rare class and from your class alone does Socialism require a real material sacrifice. You must indeed give up much coarse pride. There is no help for it, you must face that if you face Socialism at all. You must come down to a simpler and, in many material aspects, less distinguished way of living.|$|R
