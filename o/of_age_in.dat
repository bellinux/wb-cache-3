5|$|Banksia serrata plants {{generally}} become fire tolerant by five {{to seven}} years <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> that they are able to resprout afterwards. Regrowth is generally from epicormic buds under their thick bark if the plant is between 2 and 6m (7-20ft) high or possibly from the woody subterranean base known as the lignotuber of younger and smaller plants. There is doubt as to whether recovery from a lignotuber is possible, although it has been demonstrated in other Banksia species such as B. menziesii. Stem size is a critical factor; stems with a DBH of under 1cm (0.4in) are unable to withstand low intensity fires. A stem/trunk DBH of 2cm (0.8in) is needed to survive low intensity fires and of around 5cm (2in) to withstand a high intensity fire.|$|E

5|$|Breeding {{takes place}} over the warmer months with eggs laid from August to January. The clutch is laid {{on a bed of}} wood dust or leaves and {{consists}} of two to five (or rarely up to eight) round or oval glossy white eggs, each of which is generally 21 to 22mm long by 18mm (0.8 by 0.7in) wide. Clutches tend to have more eggs in earlier rather than later clutches, and in nests located further from cleared land. Eggs are laid at an interval of two to three days. Incubation takes 18 to 21 days. The female incubates the eggs and broods the young, and feeds them for their first few days before the male begins helping. She leaves to feed and drink twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Both parents take part in feeding the young, on a diet predominantly of seeds with some fruit. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless and blind and remain in the nest for an extended period. Covered in silvery-white down, they have pink skin and darker blue-grey skin around the eye. By seven days they open their eyes, and are well-covered in grey down with pin feathers emerging from their wings on day six. They are almost covered in feathers by day 21, and fledge (leave the nest) at around 23days <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> the wild and up to 30days <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> captivity.|$|E

5|$|Discontent was brewing in England {{against the}} {{personal}} rule of Henry VI, {{who had been}} declared <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> 1437. The main antagonists were Richard, Duke of York, and Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset. Somerset enjoyed great influence over the king, but after Henry had been incapacitated by mental illness in 1453, York was appointed protector in 1454. The Nevilles were by this time closely associated with York, so the natural option for Northumberland was to side with Somerset and the king. Attempts were made to reconcile Northumberland and Salisbury in the north, but little was accomplished. In December, the king rallied sufficiently to resume control of government, and York's protectorate was terminated. With Somerset back at the centre of power, civil war seemed imminent.|$|E
5|$|If the Spanish monarch ever refused in {{conscience}} {{to grant}} royal assent, a procedure {{similar to the}} Belgian handling of King Baudouin's objection {{would not be possible}} under the current constitution.

Instead, the constitution mandates the next person <b>of</b> <b>age</b> <b>in</b> the line of succession would immediately become regent. Therefore, had Juan Carlos followed the Belgian example in 2005 or 2010, a declaration of incapacity would have transferred power to Felipe, then the heir apparent.|$|E

40|$|The serum {{concentration}} of the advanced glycation end-product Nε-(carboxymethyl) lysine is increased in uremia. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) such as pentosidine and Nε-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) have been traditionally quantified by HPLC or gas chromatography—mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) have been introduced as a convenient alternative to simplify the detection and measurement <b>of</b> <b>AGEs</b> <b>in</b> proteins and tissues, but some of {{these studies are limited}} by the lack of information on the structure of the epitopes recognized by antibodies to AGE-proteins. In this work we demonstrate that an antibody used in a previous study, reporting increased levels <b>of</b> <b>AGEs</b> <b>in</b> patients with diabetes or on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD), recognizes CML as its major epitope. We also show that there is a significant correlation between the concentration <b>of</b> <b>AGEs</b> <b>in</b> serum measured by ELISA and a GC/MS assay for CML in serum proteins. Both analyses yielded comparable results, with patients on CAPD and HD having about threefold higher AGE- or CML-concentrations in their serum. Our data suggest that ELISA assays for CML should be useful for the clinical measurement <b>of</b> <b>AGEs</b> <b>in</b> serum proteins...|$|R
