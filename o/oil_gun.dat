40|$|Abstract:Air cooled <b>oil</b> <b>gun</b> (parallel type � External mixing) is {{most widely}} used <b>oil</b> <b>gun</b> in Indian thermal power plant because it is very simple, easy to operate, maintain, {{replacement}} (damaged part) and also it is cheaper than auto retract type <b>oil</b> <b>gun.</b> The main aim {{of this paper is}} to give clear idea for <b>oil</b> <b>gun</b> general arrangement, operation and maintenance. Generally in thermal power stations <b>oil</b> <b>gun</b> is not properly maintained because they might not know the proper maintenance. They do only regular maintenance which was intimated by the <b>oil</b> <b>gun</b> supplier. But the supplier does not know the working (boiler) conditions of power plant. I hereby given some suggestion for operation, handling and maintenance of <b>oil</b> <b>gun,</b> by this we can reduce frequent cleaning of <b>oil</b> <b>gun</b> and workers work load...|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. It {{is very important for}} China to reduce the consumption of petroleum under the pressure of hers fundamental realities of lean-oil [...] rich-coal and the consistently increasing price of international crude oil. For this reason, we developed series of minimal-oil igniting burners applied on the boilers in power stations to reduce the oil consumption for ignition. The most significant characteristic of the burners is the average ignitingoil reduction by over 95 %. This superior performance can be assured by some built-in igniting <b>oil</b> <b>guns</b> and by some novel designs for the minimal-oil burners. Up to now, the technology has achieved remarkable success on over 30 power units in China. vk 201...|$|R

50|$|Other minor {{differences}} included {{fuel gauge}} placement, with the UK Phantom I's at the tank but some US models having {{one on the}} dash, and manual central lubrication systems. The UK Phantom employed Enots nipples, some {{times as many as}} 50, which required attachment of a special Enots <b>oil</b> pressure <b>gun</b> and needed time-consuming service at 500, 1000 and 2000 mile intervals; the US model used a centralized Bijur system which lubricated all the oiling points with a stroke of a single pump.|$|R

50|$|As built, {{the ships}} were armed with one 4.7 in/40 gun, four 3 in/40 guns, and two 17.7 in torpedo tubes. In 1914 they were {{augmented}} {{with an additional}} two torpedo tubes. During World War I, guide rails for laying up to ten mines {{were added to the}} ships. Later wartime changes replaced all the guns with five 4 in/35 and a single 40 mm/39 AA <b>gun.</b> <b>Oil</b> capacity was also increased during the war from 100 MT to 128 MT in order to increase endurance, but the increased weight had the opposite effect: slowing the ships and reduced their endurance.|$|R

50|$|Ofer's parents {{moved to}} British Mandatory Palestine during the Third Aliyah and {{were among the}} founders of the {{settlement}} Kfar Azar. As a youth, Ofer joined the Haganah. He initially delivered Haganah newspapers to its subscribers, hung pro-Haganah posters {{in the middle of the}} night and <b>oiled</b> the <b>guns</b> belonging to the settlement. At sixteen, he left school and joined the Palmach, the elite strike force of the Haganah. He fought in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and participated in Operation Danny in which the Arab occupied towns of Lod and Ramle fell to Jewish forces. His military talents did not go unnoticed and he was handpicked for officer’s training. In the midst of his training, he learned that his Palmach unit was gearing up for Operation Yoav, an offensive in the Negev region. He left officer’s school to join his unit in time for the offensive. By the end of the war, he attained the rank of sergeant while his classmates had not yet enlisted in the army.|$|R
50|$|There are {{different}} stocks {{available for the}} Uzi proper. There is a wooden stock with a metal buttplate that comes in three similar variations that {{was used by the}} IDF. The first version had a flat butt and straight comb and had hollows for a cleaning rod and <b>gun</b> <b>oil</b> bottle. The second had an angled butt and a straight comb and no hollows. The third had an angled butt and curved comb and no hollows; a polymer version is currently available from IMI. The wooden stocks originally had a quick-release base but the ones sold in the United States have a permanent base to be compliant with US gun laws.|$|R
50|$|The police {{surgeon who}} {{was called to}} Colin Roach's corpse in the foyer of the police station said that the body {{position}} was inconsistent with suicide. The shotgun with which he was killed could not be fitted into the sports bag Roach had with him, not even when broken down. No fibers from the bag {{were found on the}} <b>gun</b> and no <b>oil</b> from the <b>gun</b> was found in the bag. When a shotgun is used for suicide the recoil damages and sometimes breaks the trigger thumb. No injury was found to Roach's hand at all. The recoiling gun will normally hit a wall or floor very hard but no marks from this were found in the police station foyer or on the gun butt.|$|R

The <b>guns</b> were {{unloaded}} on 24 August and were in action against an air raid the following day. There was a heavy raid on Swansea from 20.55 to 03.00 {{on the night of}} 1/2 September, but because RAF night fighters were in the area, 247 Bty was prevented from firing for the first three hours. After that raid, Lt-Col Raikes of 79th (HY) Rgt devised a new barrage scheme for the Swansea GDA codenamed 'Ball of Fire'. By {{the end of the month}} the responsibilities at Pembroke Dock and Cardiff had been handed over to other units and the whole of the regiment was deployed around Swansea, with a GOR established.|$|R
2500|$|Admiral John Fisher, {{responsible}} for {{reconstruction of the}} British fleet in the pre-war period, favoured large <b>guns,</b> <b>oil</b> fuel, and speed. Admiral Tirpitz, {{responsible for}} the German fleet, favoured ship survivability and chose to sacrifice some gun size for improved armour. The German battlecruiser [...] had belt armour equivalent in thickness—though not as comprehensive—to the British battleship , significantly better than on the British battlecruisers such as Tiger. German ships had better internal subdivision and had fewer doors and other weak points in their bulkheads, but with the disadvantage that space for crew was greatly reduced. As they were designed only for sorties in the North Sea they {{did not need to}} be as habitable as the British vessels and their crews could live in barracks ashore when in harbour.|$|R
5000|$|Royston's {{innovative}} park {{work also}} began during the 1950s. His first major commission was the Standard <b>Oil</b> Rod and <b>Gun</b> Club (1950) {{located at the}} Standard Oil Refinery near Point Richmond, California, and was a recreation facility for workers at the refinery. Royston's carefully zoned design provided a gymnasium, swimming pools, imaginatively designed custom play equipment, family picnic areas, and several multi-use areas {{in a series of}} skillfully layered spaces on the site of a former skeet range and fishing pier. The biomorphic forms he employed were reminiscent of his residential design work. The facility was an immediate success and attracted the attention of the Bay Area planners representing several municipalities. Royston soon was given important park and playground commissions, many of which gained attention in the national media.|$|R
50|$|Brown's straggling B-17 was now {{attacked}} by {{over a dozen}} enemy fighters (a mixture of Messerschmitt Bf 109s and Focke-Wulf Fw 190s) of JG 11 for over 10 minutes. Further damage was sustained, including damage to the number three engine, which would produce only half power (meaning the aircraft had at best 40% of its total rated power available). The bomber's internal oxygen, hydraulic and electrical systems were also damaged, and the bomber lost half of its rudder and its port (left side) elevator, {{as well as its}} nose cone. Many of the gunners' weapons then jammed, probably as a result of loss of the onboard systems leading to frozen mechanisms (the ground crew did not <b>oil</b> the <b>guns</b> correctly), leaving the bomber with only two dorsal turret guns and one of three forward-firing nose guns (from eleven available) for defense. Most of the crew were wounded: the tail gunner, Eckenrode, had been decapitated by a direct hit from a cannon shell, while Yelesanko was critically wounded in the leg by shrapnel, Blackford's feet were frozen due to shorted-out heating wires in his uniform, Pechout had been hit in the eye by a cannon shell, and Brown was wounded in his right shoulder. The morphine syrettes onboard froze, complicating first aid efforts by the crew, while the radio was destroyed and the bomber's exterior heavily damaged. Miraculously, all but Eckenrode survived.|$|R

500|$|By {{this stage}} in the war, the German {{submarine}} authorities had {{become aware of the}} existence of Q-ships and Captain Ernst Rosenow of [...] was taking no risks with his target, remaining at [...] distance watching the staged panicked evacuation of the ship. While the hidden gun crews watched the enemy approach the lifeboats, the officer in charge of the boats, Lieutenant Francis Hereford, realised that the submarine would follow his movements, as its commander assumed him to be the captain. Hereford therefore ordered his men to row back towards the ship, thus luring the enemy into range. This made the submarine commander believe that the ship’s crew were planning to regain their vessel and he immediately closed to just , surfaced and began angrily semaphoring to the [...] "survivors" [...] in the boats. This was exactly what the gun crews had been waiting for and a volley of fire was directed at the U-boat. Numerous holes were blown in the conning tower and the submarine desperately attempted to flee on the surface before slowing down and heeling over, trailing <b>oil.</b> The <b>gun</b> crews then stopped firing only for the submarine to suddenly restart its engines and attempt to escape. In a final barrage of fire the submarine was hit fatally, a large explosion blowing the vessel in two. Rosenow and 22 of his crew were killed, while two survivors were rescued by the panic party.|$|R
40|$|A {{model of}} a multibody system is {{established}} to investigate the dynamic response of an <b>oil</b> tube-shock absorber-perforating <b>gun</b> system in downhole perforation-test joint operation. In the model, the oil tube and perforating gun are modeled as elastic rods and the shock absorber is modeled as single particle system with damping and a spring. Two force continuity conditions are used to simulate the interactions among the three components. The perforation impact load is determined by an experiment of underwater explosion of perforating bullets. Using the model, the effects of charge quantity of perforating bullet, the number of shock absorbers, {{and the length of}} oil tube on the dynamic response of oil tube and packer are investigated. On this basis, a basic principle of the combination design of shock absorber and oil tube is proposed to improve the mechanical state of downhole tools. The study results can provide theoretical support for the design of downhole perforation-test joint operation...|$|R

However, Wilhelm supports the love that they had {{for each other and}} on a couple of occasions had spoken to Mieke about a woman that he had loved before he had gotten married. Brandt suspects Mieke keeps a gun hidden in her room because of the <b>gun</b> <b>oil</b> he smells. When the time comes to have the house searched before Himmler's arrival, Brandt himself searches Mieke's room. Mieke's intention, once she hears of Himmler's scheduled arrival, is to assassinate Himmler in vengeance for the murders of her father and her husband by the Gestapo. Himmler meets with the SS officer and Captain Brandt, telling them that Hitler wants to invite Wilhelm back to Berlin. This is a trap meant to expose and eradicate those who support the restoration of the monarchy. Brandt passes the information along to Wilhelm.|$|R

Traveling in various locations all around the planet including the USA, Asia, Swiss Alps, Switzerland, and Antarctica. The weapons van is brought back again and equipped this time with an automatic turret / machine gun being that the player can utilize in extreme vehicular combat resolutions. The newly acquired Interceptor SpyHunter vehicle can enter off-road mode and transform itself into a jet-ski, a snow-mobile, a motor-tricycle, and a speedboat. The player can also choose an arsenal of weapons upon their liking that are coming from the background of James Bond 007 and a chocolate sparkle of Mission Impossible. The various armament includes Mines, Smoke Screen, <b>Oil</b> Slick, Machine <b>Guns,</b> Rockets, Missiles, Lasers and Cannons.

5000|$|A well-maintained paintball marker {{will last}} longer {{and be more}} reliable. A paintball marker should be {{disassembled}} and checked for problems routinely. For example, {{it is not uncommon}} for O-rings to break, or for paintballs to break inside the barrel. The latter problem can be solved temporarily when the player is [...] "in the field" [...] by using a pipe-cleaner-like tool referred to as a squeegee. However, it is important to disassemble the marker after the game and properly clean out any affected parts with the marker company's recommended material/solvent (such as a special cloth, or lubricant) and a paper towel. After cleaning, the marker should be lubricated with commercially available paintball lubricant. Most such lubricants are oils or greases derived from formulae used in pneumatic tools (such as Dow 33) or from gun lubricants. However, lubricants marketed as <b>gun</b> <b>oils</b> should not be used, as most commercial brands contain petroleum solvents to remove powder fouling; these solvents will degrade the synthetic rubber o-rings in a paintball marker. The technician should then ensure that the marker is unloaded before firing several shots to blow out any remaining paint and dry out the interior. Replacements for broken parts should only be sourced from the manufacturer of the marker. Many guns also have elements not designed to be maintained by end users (such as solenoid valves); these should not be disassembled, and if they become faulty they are typically replaced outright.|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{detailed}} Official Narrative from the U.S. Army, more than 300 enemy fighters attacked COP Keating from surrounding high ground before 6 a.m. Under intense fire, Carter carried ammunition 100 meters across open ground from near his barracks to a Humvee {{at the south}} Battle Position, soon returning across the same distance to retrieve machine <b>gun</b> <b>oil</b> and more ammunition, and traverse that distance a third time to thus resupply the Battle Position. Though wounded within the first half-hour of battle, Carter provided accurate fire under intense pressure to drive back enemy that had infiltrated the camp perimeter. [...] He then crawled under continuing fire to another vehicle, and retrieved needed weapons and ammunition to bring back to the Battle Position. Carter crossed 30 meters of open space to provide life-extending first aid to a wounded soldier, exposed to enemy fire, then carrying him back across the 30 meters to the Humvee. As the battle progressed, Carter ran toward the tactical operations center (TOC) to coordinate reconnaissance and to obtain medical care for the wounded soldier, but, encountering {{the body of a}} fallen sergeant, found and retrieved a radio and returned to the Humvee. Carter found a litter, and with a comrade carried the wounded soldier 100 meters across the original distance to an aid station; it was then about noon. The battle extended through nightfall when reinforcements could safely land by helicopter, by which time almost two-thirds of the 53 Coalition soldiers had been killed (8) or wounded (>25).|$|R
