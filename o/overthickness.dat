40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{applications of}} the laser induced shear wave directivity pattern in the thermoelastic regime, to the detection and the in-depth profiling of <b>overthickness</b> and closed cracks perpendicular to the surface. Some results on academic samples and first measurements of actual depth profilings of welds are presented and discussed...|$|E
40|$|A {{multilayer}} plug, {{consisting of}} a set of concentric layers with independent movements, is proposed to enhance control of the final thickness distribution of deep thermoformed parts. The concept is validated experimentally and the results are compared with the predictions produced by the T-SIM software package. Given the good approximation between experimental and theoretical data, T-SIM was used to evaluate the influence of several multilayer plug parameters on the final thickness distribution. Changing the relative displacement of the plug layers together with the total plug displacement leads to a range of thickness contours, including profiles with a localised <b>overthickness,</b> or with a smooth thickness variation. The role of the displacement of the outer and inner plug layers is also assessed, showing that the former influences mainly the upper sidewall of the part, whereas the latter determines the thickness of the base...|$|E
40|$|An vision {{inspection}} {{sensor system}} for the automation of laser welding processes in heavy industries is presented. The system consists of PC based vision camera and stripe type laser diode. For image de-noising, a new surface inspection method of Tailor-welded blanks including in: median filtering, hi-level thresholding, opening and closing, mid-fine of the laser stripe extraction, has been developed. After extracting the middle line of the laser stripe, the algorithms of calculating bead width, mismatch, weld slope, convexity, concavity, <b>overthickness</b> and undercut are proposed. Finally, A series of experiments show that the proposed method in this paper is effective.

40|$|The {{ongoing process}} of {{industrialization}} of construction sites encourages {{the use of}} new building systems that conflict with traditional techniques associated with the risks of incompatibilities and continuance of control fixed ideas with a significant variability. A practical example is the cement mortar for plastering, commonly used as a corrective factor for facade flatness failures caused by the inaccuracy of the plumb line, rudimentary method used in geometric control of concrete structures and facade of mapping during {{the execution of the}} work, favoring the accumulation of errors that reflect the mortar thickness, increasing consumption, losses and defects. Alternatively for improvement, this study analyzed through a case study, the innovative application of 3 D laser scanning technology consolidated on the facade of a building to map the surface flatness of the fa√ßade and, in an unprecedented manner, to quantify the volume of mortar. The results showed the feasibility of the technique as a solution to accurately identify the critical areas of the facade on the peripheral concrete structure and masonry and calculate, based on the volumes, the financial impact associated with mortar <b>overthicknesses</b> in critical areas compared with the reductions thickness after treatment of these areas...|$|R
