5|$|There {{were rumors}} of plots {{and even of}} his escape, but in reality no serious {{attempts}} were made. For English poet Lord Byron, Napoleon was the epitome <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Romantic</b> hero, the persecuted, lonely, and flawed genius.|$|E
5|$|Another German philosopher, Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, {{praised the}} {{ideas in the}} Upanishads, as did others. In the United States, the group known as the Transcendentalists were {{influenced}} by the German idealists. Americans, such as Emerson and Thoreau embraced Schelling's interpretation of Kant's Transcendental idealism, {{as well as his}} celebration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>romantic,</b> exotic, mystical aspect of the Upanishads. As a result of the influence of these writers, the Upanishads gained renown in Western countries.|$|E
5|$|Bojić's {{popularity}} grew exponentially {{following his}} death. Many of his poems received widespread critical acclaim for their {{portrayal of the}} Serbian Army's retreat {{during the winter of}} 1915–16 and its stay on Corfu, where thousands of soldiers succumbed to disease and exhaustion and were buried at sea. Bojić's work remained popular in Yugoslavia for much of the 20th century, cementing his {{reputation as one of the}} greatest Serbian poets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Romantic</b> period.|$|E

5|$|Grissom and Sidle's {{relationship}} {{has been the subject}} of intense debate in the press and on-line forums, between fans <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>romantic</b> relationship and those who believe the romance detracts from what was once a show devoted mainly to mysteries and a forensics laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Hazlitt's {{ideas about}} {{many of the}} plays have now come to be valued as thought-provoking {{alternatives}} to those of his contemporary Coleridge, and Characters of Shakespear's Plays is now viewed as a major study of Shakespeare's plays, placing Hazlitt with Schlegel and Coleridge {{as one of the}} three most notable Shakespearean critics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Romantic</b> period.|$|E

5|$|Henry Tufton died in 1849, and castle {{ownership}} fell to Hothfields.

5|$|Largely {{concerned}} with gender issues, Midas {{comments on the}} definitions of femininity and masculinity {{in the early nineteenth}} century and the developing ideology of separate spheres which encouraged women to restrict themselves to domestic affairs and men to political affairs.

5|$|As {{noted by}} several critics and commentators, the film's story and style mirror {{elements}} from Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera. V and the Phantom both wear masks {{to hide their}} disfigurements, control others through the leverage of their imaginations, have tragic pasts, and are motivated by revenge. V and Evey's relationship also parallels many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>romantic</b> elements of The Phantom of the Opera, where the masked Phantom takes Christine Daaé to his subterranean lair to re-educate her.|$|E

5|$|Barbauld's {{career as}} a poet ended {{abruptly}} in 1812 {{with the publication of}} Eighteen Hundred and Eleven, which criticised Britain's participation in the Napoleonic Wars. She was shocked by the vicious reviews it received and published nothing else in her lifetime. Her reputation was further damaged when many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Romantic</b> poets she had inspired in the heyday of the French Revolution turned against her in their later, more conservative years. Barbauld was remembered only as a pedantic children's writer in the nineteenth century, and largely forgotten in the twentieth, but the rise of feminist literary criticism in the 1980s renewed interest in her works and restored her place in literary history.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1830s {{until the late}} 1840s Her Majesty's Theatre played host to {{the heyday of the}} era <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>romantic</b> ballet, and the theatre's {{resident}} ballet company was considered the most renowned in Europe, aside from the Ballet du Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique in Paris. The celebrated ballet master Jules Perrot began staging ballet at Her Majesty's in 1830. Lumley appointed him Premier Maître de Ballet (chief choreographer) to the theatre in 1842. Among the works of ballet that he staged were Ondine, ou La Naïade (1843), La Esmeralda (1844), and Catarina, ou La Fille du Bandit (1846), as well as the celebrated divertissement Pas de Quatre (1845). Other ballet masters created works for the ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre throughout the period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>romantic</b> ballet, most notably Paul Taglioni (son of Filippo Taglioni), who staged ballets including Coralia, ou Le Chevalier inconstant (1847) and Electra (1849, the first production of a ballet to make use of electric lighting). Arthur Saint-Léon staged such works as La Vivandière (1844), Le Violin du Diable (1849), and Le Jugement de Pâris (1850), which was considered a sequel of sorts to Pas de Quatre.|$|E
5|$|In 1797 {{the poet}} Samuel Taylor Coleridge rented the cottage. While he lived there he wrote {{many of his}} better known works. He was visited by William Wordsworth and other early members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Romantic</b> movement. Coleridge moved out in 1799 and the {{building}} was refurbished. Almost 100 years after his occupation some of his admirers leased the property and eventually bought it, after a national campaign and significant private funding. In 1909 they handed {{it over to the}} National Trust who have run it as a writer's home museum since then. In the later 20th and early 21st centuries further renovation and expansion was undertaken, since when it has won awards as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} year Schubert's brother Ferdinand sold the sonatas' autographs to another publisher, Anton Diabelli, who would only publish them about ten years later, in 1838 or 1839. Schubert had intended the sonatas to be dedicated to Johann Nepomuk Hummel, whom he greatly admired. Hummel was a leading pianist, a pupil of Mozart, and a pioneering composer <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Romantic</b> style (like Schubert himself). However, {{by the time the}} sonatas were published in 1839, Hummel was dead, and Diabelli, the new publisher, decided to dedicate them instead to composer Robert Schumann, who had praised many of Schubert's works in his critical writings.|$|E
5|$|Kilmer is {{considered}} among the last <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Romantic</b> era poets because his verse is conservative and traditional in style and does not break any of the formal rules of poetics—a style often criticized today for being too sentimental to be taken seriously. The entire corpus of Kilmer's work was produced between 1909 and 1918 when Romanticism and sentimental lyric poetry fell out of favor and Modernism took root—especially with {{the influence of the}} Lost Generation. In the years after Kilmer's death, poetry went in drastically different directions, as is seen in the work of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound, and academic criticism grew with it to eschew the more sentimental and straightforward verse.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn {{originally}} {{proposed the}} idea of the violin concerto to Ferdinand David, a close friend and then concertmaster of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra. Although conceived in 1838, the work took another six years to complete and was not premiered until 1845. During this time, Mendelssohn maintained a regular correspondence with David, who gave him many suggestions. The work itself was one of the foremost violin concertos <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Romantic</b> era and was influential on many other composers.|$|E

5|$|Mendelssohn wrote symphonies, concerti, oratorios, piano {{music and}} chamber music. His best-known works include his Overture and {{incidental}} music for A Midsummer Night's Dream, the Italian Symphony, the Scottish Symphony, the overture The Hebrides, his mature Violin Concerto, and his String Octet. His Songs Without Words are {{his most famous}} solo piano compositions. After {{a long period of}} relative denigration due to changing musical tastes and antisemitism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, his creative originality has now been recognised and re-evaluated. He is now among the most popular composers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Romantic</b> era.|$|E
5|$|Part {{of the new}} genre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Romantic</b> travel narrative, History of a Six Weeks' Tour exudes spontaneity and enthusiasm; {{the authors}} {{demonstrate}} their desire to {{develop a sense of}} taste and distinguish themselves from those around them. The romantic elements of the work would have hinted at the text's radical politics to nineteenth-century readers. However, the text's frank discussion of politics, including positive references to the French Revolution and praise of Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was unusual for a travel narrative at the time, particularly one authored primarily by a woman.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{composer}} Cesare Pugni {{was appointed}} Composer of the Ballet Music to the theatre in 1843, a position created {{for him by}} Lumley. From 1843 until 1850, he composed nearly every new ballet presented at the theatre. Pugni remains the most prolific composer of the genre, having composed more than 100 original ballets, as well as composing numerous divertissements and incidental dances that were often performed as diversions during the intermissions of opera performances at the theatre. Throughout the era <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>romantic</b> ballet, the theatre presented performances by notable ballerinas, including Marie Taglioni, Carlotta Grisi, Fanny Elssler, Lucile Grahn, and Fanny Cerrito, performing {{in the works of}} Perrot, Taglioni and Saint-Léon.|$|E
