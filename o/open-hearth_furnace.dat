50|$|N. Dobrokhotov {{proposed}} {{to increase the}} capacity of <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> to increase their productivity and reduce fuel consumption in steel smelting and later formulated the basic theses {{of the theory of}} intensification of heat work of <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces.</b> With the use of the provisions made by him in the mid 1930s were upgraded 90-ton <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> of Nizhnedneprovsk metallurgical plant in the name of Comintern. Increased heat output of the furnaces made it possible to dramatically raise their productivity and exceed all previously known records of high-speed steelification. Later was improved design of <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> of many metallurgical plants. N. Dobrokhotov {{proposed to}} equip <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> with fans for air supply, with smoke exhausters for removal of combustion products, with front wall without arch and improved refrigerators.|$|R
5000|$|... 1870: {{the works}} {{consisted}} of six Bessemer converters and four Siemens <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> ...|$|R
50|$|Changes {{in the way}} {{in which}} steel is {{produced}} had already appeared before the Carnegie Steel Company was sold. Steel manufacturers had begun to abandon the Bessemer converters and install <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces.</b> <b>Open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> were widely employed until the 1980s when the basic oxygen steelmaking, electric arc furnace and continuous casting made them obsolete. Currently, employment is extraordinarily low at the remaining plants which have been a part of the Carnegie Steel Company since 1900, though in Braddock the Edgar Thomson Steel Works is still active, producing steel slabs that are shipped up river to the Irvin Works in West Mifflin to be finished coils.|$|R
50|$|The real {{revolution}} in steelmaking only {{began at the}} end of the 1850s when the Bessemer process became the first successful method of steelmaking in quantity, followed by the <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnace.</b>|$|E
50|$|Production at the Pretoria plant {{started in}} 1934. On 4 April 1934 the first steel was tapped from the <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> at the Pretoria Works. Wartime needs for steel {{and the local}} {{manufacture}} of numerous necessities brought about {{a sharp increase in}} demand. Iscor had to expand, and the Pretoria works had reached their limit of growth.|$|E
50|$|New {{technologies}} in {{iron and steel}} manufacturing, such as the Bessemer process and <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnace,</b> combined with similar innovations in chemistry and other sciences to vastly improve productivity. New communication tools, such as the telegraph and telephone allowed corporate managers to coordinate across great distances. Innovations also occurred in how work was organized, typified by Frederick Winslow Taylor's ideas of scientific management.|$|E
50|$|Their {{plant was}} capable of {{producing}} 150,000 to 200,000 tons of {{high-grade and special steels}} each year by the Hadfield system and by employment of <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> (acid and basic), crucible and electric furnaces and many other substantial items.|$|R
50|$|In 1853 Crewe {{had begun}} to make its own wrought iron and roll its own rails, and in 1864 {{installed}} a Bessemer converter for manufacturing steel. In 1868 it became {{the first place to}} use <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> on an industrial scale. It also built its own brickworks. Later the works was fitted with two electric arc furnaces.|$|R
5000|$|... 1944 - {{still under}} construction, the Kazakh Steel Mill yielded its first steel, smelted in an <b>open-hearth</b> (Siemens-Martin) <b>furnace.</b>|$|R
50|$|It was {{established}} in 1930 by {{the decision of the}} Presidium of Supreme Soviet of the National Economy (BCHX) (USSR) in Mariupol, Ukrainian SSR (Soviet Union) and finally entered the production line in 1933 when its blast furnace put out the first iron. In January 1935 steel making production was put into operation at Azovstal, the first in the USSR 250t tilting <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> came into commission.|$|E
5000|$|The AISI {{system used}} a letter prefix to denote the {{steelmaking}} process. The prefix [...] "C" [...] denoted <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnace,</b> {{electric arc furnace}} or basic oxygen furnace, while [...] "E" [...] denotes electric arc furnace steel. A letter [...] "L" [...] within the grade name indicates lead as an added ingredient; for example, 12L14 is a common grade that is 1214 with lead added for machinability.|$|E
50|$|The {{next great}} advance in steel making was the Siemens-Martin process. Sir Charles William Siemens {{developed}} his regenerative furnace in the 1850s, {{for which he}} claimed in 1857 to able to recover enough heat to save 70-80% of the fuel. The furnace operated at a high temperature by using regenerative preheating of fuel and air for combustion. Through this method, an <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, but Siemens did not initially use it in that manner.|$|E
50|$|Integration was the watchword as {{the various}} {{processes}} were brought together by large corporations, from mining the iron ore to shipping {{the finished product}} to wholesalers. The typical steelworks was a giant operation, including blast <b>furnaces,</b> Bessemer converters, <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces,</b> rolling mills, coke ovens and foundries, as well as supported transportation facilities. The largest ones were operated in the region from Chicago to St. Louis to Baltimore, Philadelphia and Buffalo. Smaller operations appeared in Birmingham, Alabama, and in California.|$|R
50|$|Most of the iron- and steel-making {{equipment}} in general use was domestically produced. This included blast furnaces based on Chinese improvements to old Soviet designs, ore-beneficiation plants, <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces,</b> sideblown converters, electric furnaces, {{and a wide}} range of steel-finishing equipment. To achieve a higher technological level, various pieces of equipment were imported since China had not assimilated the technology necessary for domestic production. In most instances the industry imported only the main equipment, neglecting necessary control instruments and auxiliary technologies.|$|R
50|$|Technology and {{technique}} of using {{of natural gas}} in open-hearth production of the Soviet Union created mainly through the works of N. Dobrokhotov. Before him, the natural gas was used in a mixture with fuel oil. In 1959, N. Dobrokhotov with students suggested to heat three-way <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> with natural gas instead of a mixture of coke oven and blast-furnace gas. The method was first introduced at several furnaces of Zaporizhstal and K. Liebknecht plants, and then - in many plants of the country.|$|R
50|$|Wellman {{began his}} career working at the Nashua Iron Company. He was {{encouraged}} by his father to build a regenerative gas furnace for the company. Wellman did this, impressing Carl Wilhelm Siemens, who immediately hired him to establish the first crucible-steel furnace in America. Wellman went on to improve upon the open-hearth process of steel rail production, which in turn had improved upon the Bessemer process. In 1869, Wellman built the first commercially successful <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> in America at the Bay State Iron Works in South Boston.|$|E
50|$|In 1878 the Nova Scotia Forge Company was {{constructed}} on a 160 acre site occupying {{the east bank}} of the East River of Pictou in Trenton, replacing the Hope Iron Works. The new plant sought markets in producing forgings for the booming railway industry, creating an intense demand for raw steel and iron. The Nova Scotia Steel Company was established in 1882 on the same site to supply raw material to the Nova Scotia Forge Company and produced the first steel in Canada at its Trenton plant using the Siemens process in an <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> in 1883. Both companies soon merged to form the Nova Scotia Steel and Forge Company.|$|E
5000|$|Sir Carl Wilhelm Siemens {{developed}} the Siemens regenerative furnace in the 1850s, and claimed in 1857 to be recovering enough heat to save 70-80% of the fuel. This furnace operates {{at a high}} temperature by using regenerative preheating of fuel and air for combustion. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, but Siemens did not initially use it for that.|$|E
50|$|In 1987 China was the world's fifth-largest {{producer}} {{of iron and}} steel, but lagged far behind developed countries in production methods and quality. Most steel capacity was in <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> with basic oxygen furnaces, electric furnaces, and side-blown converters. Much of the iron and coking coal used in making steel was of low quality. Approximately 25 percent of the country's coal went for steel production in 1985. In 1985 capital construction, considered excessive by the Chinese, exacerbated existing shortages of rolled steel, and imports filled 25 percent of domestic demand.|$|R
5000|$|... 1970 brought {{completed}} {{construction of}} a $12.8 million strand casting facility that produced steel slabs faster and reduced handling costs. By 1974 production of raw steel reach 958,000 tons and net sales reached $283.4 million. Huston Jr. retired that year ending the family dynasty since 1810. The following year the mill equipped four enormous electric furnaces that phased out the <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces.</b> Economic problems hit the company hard in the late 70’s. High energy costs, interest rates, and employment costs as well as competition from other metals and cheap imported material put a decrease on net income from 4.2% to 1.3% and plates sales dropped from 11% to 8%.|$|R
5000|$|Wamsely {{was born}} in Ourimbah, New South Wales in 1938. His passion for Australian {{wildlife}} was born when the seven-year-old Wamsley's family moved to a 67 hectare bushland block at Niagara Park. At age sixteen Wamsley became a trainee metallurgist with BHP. Dissatisfied with the job he became a labourer in BHP's <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> and worked a second job renovating run down houses. By age 23 Wamsley was a millionaire. Approximately two years later Wamsley entered the University of Newcastle, Australia. The thirty-year-old Wamsley graduated with a PhD in Mathematics and moved to Flinders University to lecture. [...] His doctoral thesis from the University of Queensland, at only 70 pages, is among the shortest theses in the library.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Sir Charles William Siemens had {{developed}} his regenerative furnace in the 1850s. His furnace operated {{at a high}} temperature by using regenerative preheating of fuel and air for combustion. In regenerative preheating, the exhaust gases from the furnace are pumped into a chamber containing bricks, where heat is transferred from the gases to the bricks. The flow of the furnace is then reversed so that fuel and air pass through the chamber and are heated by the bricks. Through this method, an <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> can reach temperatures high enough to melt steel, and this process made cremation an efficient and practical proposal. Charles's nephew, Carl Friedrich von Siemens perfected {{the use of this}} furnace for the incineration of organic material at his factory in Dresden. The radical politician, Sir Charles Wentworth Dilke, took the corpse of his dead wife there to be cremated in 1874. The efficient and cheap process brought about the quick and complete incineration of the body and was a fundamental technical breakthrough that finally made industrial cremation a practical possibility.|$|E

25|$|The {{northeast}} of China was marked out {{to become a}} major industrial centre for the new People's Republic of China. Anshan was set to become {{a key part of}} this industrial development. The steel mills had been damaged during the wars. In December 1948, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company—also known as Angang—was founded. Production in the newly repaired steel plant resumed on July 9, 1949. The plant was expanded to become the largest steel producer in China. Other industries setup alongside the steel plant including mining for coal, iron and other minerals. This industrial wealth had an environmental cost. The <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> of the steel mill created large amounts of dust and other pollution. Along with its growing reputation as a major steel producer, Anshan was also gaining a reputation as a dirty, smelly town.|$|R
50|$|Between 1937 and 1940, {{a modern}} steel {{production}} and rolling section was built, with machinery imported from Nazi Germany, covering 8500 m2 and fitted with four special components. First, the four Siemens-Martin <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces,</b> heated by six gas generators, could each fit 25 loads of tons, {{with a total}} capacity of 90,000 tons of steel ingots per year. The alloy loaded into the furnaces was 75% cast iron and 25% scrap iron, and the hall where they were located was fitted with a mixer for 200 tons of liquid cast iron, to be used during production. Second, the 5 ton-per-load electric furnace produced special steels for tools, including alloys of chromium and tungsten, up to 6000 tons a year. Later, this was modernized {{and moved to the}} foundry. Third, the foundry room with pits for shaping steel into ingots. Fourth, seven sliding bridges: two 50-ton ones; one 3-ton one; one 7.5-ton bridge fitted with electromagnets; two 7.5.-ton cantilever bridges; and one featuring a gripping mechanism for transporting finished ingots.|$|R
40|$|This book equips {{a reader}} with {{knowledge}} necessary for critical analysis of  innovations in electric arc furnaces {{and helps to}} select the most effective ones and for their successful implementation. The book also covers general issues related to history of development, current state and prospects of steelmaking in Electric Arc Furnaces. Therefore, it can be useful for everybody who studies metallurgy, including students of colleges and universities. The modern concepts of mechanisms of Arc Furnace processes are {{are discussed in the}} book at the level sufficient to solve practical problems: To help readers lacking knowledge required in the field of heat transfer as well as hydro-gas dynamics, it contains several chapters which provide the required minimum of information in these fields of science. In order to better assess different innovations, the book describes experience of the application of similar innovations in <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces</b> and oxygen converters. Some promising ideas on key issues regarding intensification of the heat, which are of interest for developers of new processes and equipment for Electric Arc Furnaces, are also the concern of the book It should be noted, that carrying out the simplified calculations as distinct from using "off the shelf" programs greatly promotes comprehensive understanding of physical basics of processes and effects produced by various factors. This book gives numerous examples of such calculations performed by means of simplified methods and formulas. Getting familiar with material in this book will allow the reader to perform required calculations on his / her own without any difficulties...|$|R
40|$|Reasons are {{studied for}} the short life of sprung-suspended roofs of open-hearth {{furnaces}} and refractory objects are developed with reduced thermal conductivity and a special hook. During refractory laying a shrinkage-free high-temperature laying mortar is used. OAO Nizhnyi Tagil ’ Metallurgical Combine organizes industrial out-put of the refractories developed. Industrial testing is carried out in <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> arched roofs of OAO Nizhnyi Tagil ’ Metallurgical Combine (NTMK) and ZAO Nizhnyi Sergi Metalware and Metallurgical Plant (NMMZ). According to test results the increase in roof life is 20 – 30 %, and the economic effect for two open-hearth furnaces is 4, 656 million rubles per year...|$|E
40|$|Steel {{production}} process in an <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> {{is divided into}} five basic stages: furnace adaptation, furnace charging, melting, refining and cast finishing. Individual stages differ from each other with respect to heat load, metallurgical reactions processing and duration. These differences directly influence {{the quality and quantity}} of emitted pollutants. 2 CONTRIBUTION TO TOTAL EMISSIONS This process is being gradually phased out in particular in Western Europe and its percentage contribution to total pollutant emission should decrease. According to the OSPARCOM-HELCOM-UNECE inventory for 1990 almost all heavy metal emissions from this source category occur in Central and Eastern Europe (see Table 2 - 3). The share of steel smelting by the open hearth method in the CIS countries exceeds 60 - 65 %, though there is a tendency for its decrease and transition to a converter method and electric arc smelting.

Life, for him, would have been a poor thing without new {{conflicts}} to absorb his energy; and he had already made of the Boyne Iron Works, with its <b>open-hearth</b> <b>furnaces,</b> a marvel of modern efficiency that had opened the eyes of the Steel world, and had drawn the attention of a Personality in New York,--a Personality {{who was one of the}} new and dominant type that had developed with such amazing rapidity, the banker-dinosaur; preying upon and superseding the industrial-dinosaur, conquering type of the preceding age, builder of the railroads, mills and manufactories. The banker-dinosaurs, the gigantic ones, were in Wall Street, and strove among themselves for the industrial spoils accumulated by their predecessors. It was characteristic of these monsters that they never fought in the open unless they were forced to. Then the earth rocked, huge economic structures tottered and fell, and much dust arose to obscure the vision of smaller creatures, who were bewildered and terrified. Such disturbances were called [...] "panics," [...] and were blamed by the newspapers on the Democratic party, or on the reformers who had wantonly assailed established institutions. These dominant bankers had contrived to gain control of the savings of thousands and thousands of fellow-citizens who had deposited them in banks or paid them into insurance companies, and with the power thus accumulated had sallied forth to capture railroads and industries. The railroads were the strategic links. With these in hand, certain favoured industrial concerns could be fed, and others starved into submission.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The process {{developed}} in the U K to produce magnesium hydroxide from seawater is described, together with the heat reatment that he hydroxide r ceives toproduce the active oxide. Some of the characteristics required of the dolomite used in the process are also discussed. Impurities introduced by the seawater a e noted and {{the means by which}} they can be reduced explained. Magnesium oxide has long been an important industrial material. The major tonnage outlet for magnesia has been the refractories industry in which it is employed as 'dead-burned' grain magnesite for the construction and maintenance of the hearths or bottoms of <b>open-hearth</b> steel <b>furnaces.</b> Magnesia also is used in the form of calcined refractory magnesite brick and as a chemical addition in the manufacture of chrome, olivine and other refractories. The industrial importance of magnesia is due to its chemical behaviour and this is largely determined by the position of magnesium in the periodic table. Magnesium oxide is a weak base, particularly at high temperatures, and therefore magnesium oxide is barely attacked by alkalis but readily by acids. All strong mineral acids dissolve or corrode magnesiu...|$|R
