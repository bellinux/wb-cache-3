40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} generic {{reduction}} from the problem <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>an</b> epsilon-well-supported Nash equilibrium (WSNE) to that <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>an</b> Theta(epsilon) -approximate Nash equilibrium (ANE), in large games with n players and a bounded number of strategies for each player. Our reduction complements the existing literature on relations between WSNE and ANE, and {{can be applied to}} extend hardness results on WSNE to similar results on ANE. This allows one to focus on WSNE first, which is in general easier to analyze and control in hardness constructions. As an application we prove a 2 ^Omega(n/log n) lower bound on the randomized query complexity <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>an</b> epsilon-ANE in binary-action n-player games, for some constant epsilon> 0. This answers an open problem posed by Hart and Nisan and Babichenko, and is very close to the trivial upper bound of 2 ^n. Previously for WSNE, Babichenko showed a 2 ^Omega(n) lower bound on the randomized query complexity <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>an</b> epsilon-WSNE for some constant epsilon> 0. Our result follows directly from combining Babichenko 2 ̆ 7 s result and our new reduction from WSNE to ANE...|$|R

5|$|The {{extension}} of Apollonius' problem to three dimensions, namely, the problem <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> fifth sphere that is tangent to four given spheres, {{can be solved}} by analogous methods. For example, the given and solution spheres can be resized so that one given sphere is shrunk to point while maintaining tangency. Inversion in this point reduces Apollonius' problem to finding a plane that is tangent to three given spheres. There are in general eight such planes, which become the solutions to the original problem by reversing the inversion and the resizing. This problem was first considered by Pierre de Fermat, and many alternative solution methods have been developed over the centuries.|$|E

Beebe eventually helped Elswyth purchase a small farm near Wilmington, Vermont, where he visited her frequently.

5|$|A {{knee injury}} would limit Comminges to just two {{appearances}} during the 2009–10 season, missing {{nine months of}} first-team action {{as a result of}} the injury. He had suffered the injury during training at the club after teammate Jay Bothroyd fell awkwardly onto Comminges, causing his knee ligament to detach. Comminges originally attempted to continue training but was ordered not to by manager Dave Jones on the advice of club doctors, who later discovered the severity of the injury. Comminges' contract was initially due to expire at the end of the season but, having suffered the injury, he was offered a six-month extension by the club until January 2011 in order to regain fitness and improve his chances <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> new club. His appearance as a 90th-minute substitute in a 3–1 away victory at Plymouth Argyle on 18 August 2009 would ultimately be his last for the club.|$|E

5|$|Although Beebe and {{his team}} enjoyed {{rewarding}} seasons at Rancho Grande in 1945 and 1946, they did not return there in 1947. The reason they gave in their annual report was that the previous two seasons had produced so much material that they needed an additional year to analyze it, but in reality this was more the result of insufficient funding {{as well as the}} unstable state of Venezuelan politics. Beebe returned to Rancho Grande in 1948, where he completed several technical papers about the migration patterns of birds and insects, as well as a comprehensive study of the area's ecology which he coauthored with Jocelyn Crane. Realizing that the area's politics might soon put an end to their research there, in spring of 1948 Jocelyn made a side trip to Trinidad and Tobago in hope <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> site for a research station where the politics would be more secure. Finally, when the 1948 Venezuelan coup d'état installed Marcos Pérez Jiménez as Venezuela's dictator, Beebe decided that he could no longer continue to work in Venezuela. Beebe described his experiences at Rancho Grande in his 1949 book High Jungle, which was the last of Beebe's major books.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, NSB {{started the}} process <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> {{replacement}} for the El 9. New locomotives would cost NOK20 million, and the company saw it as unrealistic to invest so much in a marginal branch line. NSB had also concluded its away-with-the-steam program, and therefore had a lack of locomotives in general. If {{a new class of}} locomotives was to be built, it would have to satisfy more than the requirements for the Flåm Line, so NSB instead started investigating whether any of the older models could be used. Tests were performed in 1971 and 1973 with El 11, built between 1951 and 1964, and El 13, built between 1957 and 1966. Neither was considered optimal: El 11 allowed the train weight to increase to , but the train had the steps for the voltage regulator and the commutation set for too high speeds. El 13 had rheostatic brakes, which were not suitable for the gradient; the locomotives were also better suited for mainline service and would therefore not be prioritized for branch lines.|$|E
5|$|Hilbert spaces form a basic tool in {{the study}} of partial {{differential}} equations. For many classes of partial differential equations, such as linear elliptic equations, it is possible to consider a generalized solution (known as a weak solution) by enlarging the class of functions. Many weak formulations involve the class of Sobolev functions, which is a Hilbert space. A suitable weak formulation reduces to a geometrical problem the analytic problem <b>of</b> <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> solution or, often what is more important, showing that a solution exists and is unique for given boundary data. For linear elliptic equations, one geometrical result that ensures unique solvability for a large class of problems is the Lax–Milgram theorem. This strategy forms the rudiment of the Galerkin method (a finite element method) for numerical solution of partial differential equations.|$|E
