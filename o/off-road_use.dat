25|$|It {{was decided}} to design a new diesel engine family that could be {{produced}} in various capacities and states of tune suitable for all of Rover's needs. The development was codenamed Project Storm and design responsibility was given to Land Rover who were to build the engines. The result was a range of engines using the L-Series as a base—the bore/stroke dimensions were the same and the Storm engine used the same piston and connecting rod assemblies. The Storm utilised Electronic Unit Injection by Lucas (at the time this technology was rare on small-capacity engine, being used only on large commercial vehicles) and a cross-flow aluminium alloy cylinder head on a cast-iron block. The designers had aimed at increasing servicing intervals so the engine incorporated both conventional and centrifugal oil filters. The electronic systems included an 'anti-stall' system to allow heavy loads to be started from rest at idle speed and two programmed operating modes for road and <b>off-road</b> <b>use.</b> The overhead camshaft (operating both valves and the unit injectors) was chain-driven. The Storm design encompassed 4-, 5- and 6-cylinder engines (of 2, 2.5 and 3 litres respectively).|$|E
25|$|The Range Rover used {{permanent}} four-wheel drive, {{rather than}} the switchable rear-wheel/four-wheel drive on Land Rover Series vehicles, and had a lever for switching ratios on the transfer box for <b>off-road</b> <b>use.</b> Originally, the only gearbox available was a four-speed manual unit, until Fairey overdrive became an option after 1977. A three-speed Chrysler TorqueFlite automatic gearbox became an option in 1982, which was upgraded to a 4-speed ZF box in 1985, coupled to an LT230 transfer box. The other major transmission upgrade in the Range Rover's lifetime was the switch from the LT95 combined four-speed manual gearbox and transfer box to the LT77 five-speed gearbox and separate LT230 transfer box in 1983. The LT230 was later used on both the Defender and Discovery models, but was replaced on the Range Rover by a Borg Warner chain-driven transfer box incorporating an automatic viscous coupling limited slip differential - earlier transmissions had a manual differential lock (operated by a vacuum servo on the LT95 and mechanically on the LT230). The LT77 had two major design changes: first an upgrade to larger bearings for the layshaft and new ratios around 1988, then a newly designed synchro hub for third and fourth gear and double synchros for first and second. This {{is also known as}} the suffix H gearbox or LT77s.|$|E

2500|$|According to Gary Flint, the truck's Variable Torque Management Four-Wheel Drive (VTM-4) system —co-developed with BorgWarner— [...] "provides {{front-wheel drive}} for dry-pavement {{cruising}} conditions and engages all-wheel drive when {{needed to improve}} stability or maneuverability" [...] and supports medium duty <b>off-road</b> <b>use.</b> The electromagnetically driven clutch-operated differential can be manually locked (VTM-4 Lock) to help the truck better handle adverse terrain or become unstuck. It also has a four-channel fully automatic Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) system {{that is designed to}} enhance control during acceleration, cornering, and collision-avoidance maneuvers and can be manually disabled to prevent undesirable throttle intervention in off-road conditions.|$|E
2500|$|High-intensity {{discharge}} (HID) {{lights were}} the brightest lights available for bicycles until recently eclipsed by the advances in LED lights. [...] They are very efficient, very bright, but expensive. They {{also tend to}} have high power consumption (although they use less power than halogens for higher output), so a relatively limited burn time. Otherwise {{they have the same}} advantages and disadvantages as rechargeable halogen systems, and like halogen systems they are designed primarily for <b>off-road</b> <b>use,</b> having rotationally symmetrical beams which cast as much light up as down. [...] An additional disadvantage compared with halogen or LED lights is that the HID lamp does not tolerate repeated strikes, and in many cases does not relight immediately after shutting down. [...] Likewise, should the battery level fall too low, the lamp will shut down rather than dimming. [...] But the longer battery life than halogens tends to negate these problems, as many riders simply switch the light on and leave it running throughout the ride.|$|E
2500|$|All {{wheel drive}} (AWD) {{historically}} was synonymous with [...] "four-wheel drive" [...] on four-wheeled vehicles, and six-wheel drive on 6×6s, and so on, {{being used in}} that fashion at least {{as early as the}} 1920s., GMC had orders for more than 4,400 all-wheel-drive military trucks." [...] Today in North America the term is applied to both heavy vehicles as well as light passenger vehicles. When referring to heavy vehicles the term is increasingly applied to mean [...] "permanent multiple-wheel drive" [...] on 2×2, 4×4, 6×6 or 8×8 drive train systems that include a differential between the front and rear drive shafts. This is often coupled with some sort of anti-slip technology, increasingly hydraulic-based, that allows differentials to spin at different speeds but still be capable of transferring torque from a wheel with poor traction to one with better. Typical AWD systems work well on all surfaces, but are not intended for more extreme <b>off-road</b> <b>use.</b> When used to describe AWD systems in light passenger vehicles, it refers to a system that applies torque to all four wheels (permanently or on demand) and/or is targeted at improving on-road traction and performance (particularly in inclement conditions), rather than for off-road applications.|$|E

2500|$|From Spring 2007 {{a series}} of changes {{were made to the}} Defender, most of which were {{implemented}} to meet emissions and safety legislation. The biggest change was to the drivetrain. The Td5 engine was replaced by an engine from Ford's DuraTorq line (AKA the Puma engine), built in their factory in Dagenham, making the Td5 the last Land Rover engine to be built in-house at Solihull. The engine chosen was from the ZSD family, being a version of the 2.4-litre four-cylinder unit also used in the highly successful Ford Transit. The engine's lubrication and sealing system was adapted for use in wet, dusty conditions and to maintain lubrication at extreme angles in <b>off-road</b> <b>use.</b> The power level remains the same at , but with a lower power peak speed for towing and better acceleration. Torque output rose from [...] to [...] due to the fitting of a variable-geometry turbocharger. This produces a wider spread of torque than the Td5, from 1500rpm to 2000rpm. The engine is mated to a new six-speed gearbox. First gear is lower than the previous gearbox for better low-speed control, whilst the higher sixth gear is intended to reduce noise and fuel consumption at high speeds.|$|E
2500|$|The chassis {{was carried}} {{over from the}} second {{generation}} models, retaining the fully independent suspension (with minor revisions) and the four-wheel disc brake system. The engine line-up and horsepower ratings were also carried over {{from the previous year}} as were the 3 and 4-speed manual transmissions. The new optional Turbo Hydramatic 3-speed automatic transmission (RPO M40) replaced the two-speed Powerglide. The L30, a [...] small-block [...] V8 engine rated at [...] and a 3-speed manual transmission were standard, but only a few hundred 3-speed manual equipped cars were sold. The 4-speed manual was available in M20 wide-ratio or M21 close-ratio transmission versions. The M22 “Rock Crusher”, a heavy duty, close-ratio 4-speed gearbox, was also available for certain applications. The engine line-up included the L79, a [...] high performance version of the [...] small-block. Also available were several variants of the [...] big-block V8, that taken together made up nearly half the cars. There was the L36, a [...] version with a Rochester 4-barrel carburetor; The L68, a [...] motor with a Holley triple 2-barrel carb set up (3 X 2 tri-power); The L71, generating [...] with a tri-power; The L89 option was the L71 engine but with much lighter aluminum cylinder heads rather than the standard cast iron. Then there was the L88 engine that Chevrolet designed strictly for <b>off-road</b> <b>use</b> (racing), with a published rating of , but featured a high-capacity 4-barrel carb, aluminum heads, a unique air induction system, and an ultra-high compression ratio (12.5:1). All small block cars had low-profile hoods. All big block cars had domed hoods for additional engine clearance with twin simulated vents and “427” emblems {{on either side of the}} dome. The new seven-inch wide steel wheels had F70x15 nylon bias-ply tires standard with either white or red stripe tires optional. Rare options were: L88 engine (80), J56 heavy-duty brakes (81), UA6 alarm system (388), L89 aluminum heads (624).|$|E
