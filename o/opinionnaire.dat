40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to present the}} views of elementary, {{middle school and high}} school certificated personnel in the Griffin-Spalding County School System toward merit pay and to determine whether these views positive or negative. An educational <b>opinionnaire</b> was designed and pilot tested on a small group of central office personnel, including two schoolbased administrators. The pilot test <b>opinionnaire</b> instrument was calculated at a coefficient alpha reliability of. 78. Following the pilot testing, the <b>opinionnaire</b> instrument was distributed to 100 elementary, {{middle school and high school}} certificated personnel in the Griffin-Spalding County School System. Sixty four percent of the total opinionnaires distributed were returned. From the tabulation and analytical treatment of the data, it was concluded that certificated personnel in the Griffin-Spalding County School System displayed strong negative attitudes about merit pay as the means to reward master teachers or superior teachers. Participants 2 ̆ 7 responses suggest strongly that there is no fairway to implement any form of merit pay. It was also concluded that the certificated personnel generally held positive attitudes about their overall commitment to the educational system and about the educational system in Griffin-Spalding County. Negative views reported regarding the ability of the school system to provide for a fair and impartial implementation of merit pay.

40|$|The study, â€œFactors Promoting Excellence in Schoolsâ€� took {{cognizance}} of {{the pressing}} problem {{that there was}} widespread deterioration of education in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan. The stakeholders had many expectations from the secondary schools both in public (government) and private sectors. The parents also needed feedback and authentic information about the criteria of excellent schools. It was therefore considered imperative to identify factors that promoted excellence in schools {{on the basis of}} information obtained from review of global literature as well as the feedback provided by stakeholders in the form of their responses. The items included in the <b>opinionnaires</b> and interviews for principals, teachers, parents and students were mostly derived from the authentic sources that were studied. For the purpose of obtaining relevant information from participants items were mentioned under different categories such as school specific statements, school improvement strategies and the skills of effective principals. The population of the study included 247 principals/headmasters, 2964 teachers, 494 parents and more than 10, 000 students of 10 th class in total number of 247 boysâ€™ high schools in Peshawar City including 27 schools in public (government) and 220 in private sector in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. The sample included 30 principals, 60 teachers, 600 students of 10 th class and 60 parents. The primary data were collected through <b>opinionnaires</b> administrated to principals/headmasters, teachers and students, while closed-ended interviews were held with purposively selected parents. The results of Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Peshawar for 10 th class of the sampled schools for the last 03 years (2008 - 10) were also made part of secondary data. The data received both quantitative and qualitative treatment. The quantitative analysis applied statistical measures to some of the aspects of the collected data. The data were analyzed with the help of tables and graphs and rendered meaningful with discussion and interpretation. The qualitative data were placed under different patterns and categories for discussion. The outcome of the study indicated that excellence was multi-dimensional phenomenon and, therefore, many factors collectively contributed to effectiveness of school. The most important factors included relevant curricula, devoted and well trained teachers, cocurricular activities, effective principals, collegiality of teachers and the needed infrastructure. The interventional role of principals also made difference in school effectiveness. They could intervene in matters of instructional supervision, efficient administration, promoting collegiality of teachers, and including them in decision-making processes. The positive school-community relationships were also instrumental in school effectiveness. The study found that excellent schools had effective classroom interaction, stakeholdersâ€™ consideration that it was better school for teaching-learning and both teachers and students were proud of the effectiveness of their schools. The recommendations of the study were a set of general and specific factors developed on the basis of review of literature and responses of subjects of different categories. They included a focus on within and out of school factors such as leadership skills of principals, qualified and devoted teachers, better school environment and infrastructure as well as effective school-home relationships.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of a microcomputer-assisted instructional program on the ability of college choral ensemble members to sing melodic configurations at sight. A two-way analysis of variance was constructed to research four questions. After a microcomputer was obtained and set up, two criterion tests [...] the Singing AchievementTest (Bowles) and a microcomputer-generated sightsinging test (MGST) [...] were given to forty-one members of choral performing ensembles at Fort Wayne Bible College. The students were divided into two ability groups based upon the Singing Achievement Test pretest scores. Each ability group was then randomly divided into experimental and control groups by means of a table of random numbers. There was no attempt made to single out participants with special abilities or trainingAn eight-week experiment with the microcomputer program, MELODIOUS DICTATOR, was constructed consisting of three non-consecutive fifteen-minute periods per week for all experimental group participants. The control group attended choral rehearsals with the experimental group but had no exposure to the computer program. After the eight weeks, the same criterion tests were readministered to all participants. An <b>Opinionnaire</b> was also completed by the students in the experimental group. Data-were processed statistically by the use of a two-way analysis of variance. The ability level group and the experimental/control group were independent variables. Pretest scores for Singing Achievement Test, melodic errors-Singing Achievement Test, and microcomputer-generated sightsinging test, and posttest scores for the same three tests were the dependent variables. Results of these data and observations from the <b>Opinionnaire</b> led to the following conclusions: 1. There was no significant effect on the ability of college choral ensemble members to sing melodic configurations at sight through the use of the MELODIOUS DICTATOR as measured by mean scores of two criterion posttests. 2. Differences in criterion posttest mean scores between high and low ability groups were significant at the. 05 level. 3. The MELODIOUS DICTATOR assisted students in the development of their melodic dictation skills as measured by the difference between the first and last experiment total notes notated and total notes notated correctly. However, no relationship was found between success as measured by the MELODIOUS DICTATOR and the individual student's perception of success as measured by the <b>Opinionnaire.</b> 4. Students did have a somewhat positive attitude toward the MELODIOUS DICTATOR as revealed by the <b>Opinionnaire.</b> While the MELODIOUS DICTATOR did not seem to improve sightsinging skills significantly, benefits of the CAI program were evident through direct contact between the program and the students. The need for supervision, tutoring, and maintenance was negligible.

The purposes were to determine: the impact of the Texas Career Ladder Plan as an incentive for improved job performance; the strengths and weaknesses of the current Texas Career Ladder Plan; the types of incentives that teachers believe would motivate them to perform better; and the suggestions that teachers have to modify the current Texas Career Ladder Plan. An <b>opinionnaire</b> was developed to obtain data pertinent to the perceived impact of the Texas Career Ladder Plan in providing incentives for improved job performance. A random sample of 500 elementary school teachers and 500 secondary school teachers was selected from the personnel rosters of the participating schools. Data from 92 percent of the subjects sampled was achieved. A descriptive analysis was used to interpret data collected in this study. The findings indicated that the Texas Career Ladder Plan has had no impact or a perceived negative impact upon the motivational levels of teachers as indicated by 14 of the <b>opinionnaire</b> items surveyed. There was a perceived positive impact upon the motivational levels of teachers as indicated by eight of the <b>opinionnaire</b> items surveyed. The most frequent suggestion as an incentive to motivate teachers was monetary and the most frequent suggestion to improve the Texas Career Ladder Plan was to improve the teacher appraisal system.

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} physical education and sport in Thailand and, based upon expert opinion, to develop a blueprint of physical education and sport for the nation building of Thailand. The investigation concentrated on the history, role and function, purpose of governmental involvement, and future prospects of physical education and sport in Thailand. Data were collected from library sources and by interviews and <b>opinionnaires</b> from leaders of physical education, sports organizations, and other concerned groups. The study presents historical aspects which have affected the development of physical education. Although the Thai people value their traditional games, international sports have been recognized as a means of establishing international relationships. Schools now offer physical education programs, and professional preparation institutions and national sports organizations have been established to assist in the development of the nation and its people. The role and function of physical education and sport, and the purpose of governmental involvement, relate closely to national ideologies in promoting ethnology and culture, national prestige, fitness, internal relations, recreation, economics and commerce, physical therapy, the military, politics, and international relationships. The future prospects of physical education involve six factors: human values, administrative needs, additional program needs, financial needs, facilities, and governmental involvement. Respondents in the study believed that the schools and sports organizations should provide well-planned physical education and sport programs for the public; that sports administration should be spread throughout the kingdom; that facilities and sport training centers need to be established; and that the government should give more support, especially financially, to physical education and sport development. A blueprint for development was based on the analysis of results of this investigation. The main factors were: dissemination, equipment and facilities, physical education and sport in educational institutions, professional preparation, administrative systems, resource materials, promotion, participants, and international cooperation. These involve changes in national policy and organizational structures. Causes and effects were presented and policies recommended for the development throughout the kingdom of physical education and sports, which presently exist mostly in the City of Bangkok. Implementation procedures were suggested for the utilization of physical education and sports in the nation building of Thailand...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} and report on aspects of the leadership role of the secondary science teacher as interpreted by the science teachers, principals, and supervisors. The <b>opinionnaire</b> developed and used in this study was designed to elicit information regarding the leadership role of the secondary school science teacher as this role relates to the science program. The study population included 971 Indiana and responded to the statements of the <b>opinionnaire.</b> The <b>opinionnaire</b> was designed to elicit information about current practices and future concepts about the role of the science teacher, and the relation of this role to effective science leadership. An <b>opinionnaire</b> was mailed to each individual in the study population with necessary directions and information for the respondent, and a return envelope for his convenience. The study populations' responses to the various <b>opinionnaire</b> statements were transferred to optical Ohio science teachers, principals, and supervisors who scanner forms for computer processing. The data were treated by a cross correlation technique which was presented in terms of the number and percentage of respondents' reactions, and by a chi-square value to determine the significance of each statement. Five null hypotheses were tested in order to examine the relationships between the observed results and the expected results on the hypothesis of equal probability of the responses of science teachers, principals, and supervisors. The major findings were reported for each of the following areas of concern. The current role of science teachers as leaders in science. The current role of science teachers in an effective science program. The future role of science teachers as leaders in an ideal science department. The extent of unity present in the total science programs of representative school systems. Competencies needed for the development of science teachers. From this investigation a generalization can be made that the principals and supervisors are more positive about the contributions of science teachers as leaders in science education than are science teachers themselves. The majority of the three groups of the study population believe that the main reason the science teachers participate in activities conducted or organized by the science department is for personal satisfaction of helping others and not for leadership opportunities. They feel that having knowledge and understanding of materials and apparatus appropriate for teaching science is one of the most important current roles of the science teacher in an effective science program. The science teachers believe that the greatest obstacle that should be overcome to enable the science department to become more successful is the excessive teacher load; while inadequate budget for the science department is held as the greatest obstacle to be overcome by both the principals and the supervisors. The opinions of the study population concerning the leadership, goals, and organization of the science department were conflicting. The unified theme for the science teacher is that leadership, goals, and organization are the responsibility of each individual teacher. The principals generally agree that leadership, goals, and organization are the responsibility of the science teachers of each building; while the supervisors generally agree that leadership, goals, and organization are the responsibility of a central planning committee of science teachers from grades K through 12.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effects of the Teacher-Advisor System on the students of Technical High School in the areas of attitude, attendance, behavior, and achievement. Two basic research tools were used. Student perceptions {{of the effects of the}} Teacher-Advisor System on the attitude of the student body was measured by the use of an <b>opinionnaire.</b> To measure the change in attendance, behavior, and achievement, a modified static group (ex-post facto) comparison was used (Campbell 2 ̆ 6 Stanley, 1968). ^ The basis for the <b>opinionnaire</b> was the eleven Teacher-Advisor goals that were established by the professional staff of Technical High School. From these eleven goals a twenty-seven question <b>opinionnaire</b> was designed. A two-way analysis of covariance was used to study the effects of the Teacher-Advisor System on attendance and behavior while a one-way analysis of covariance compared the academic achievement of the students. The number of absences was used as the measure of attendance and behavior was measured by the number of suspensions and expulsions. California Achievement Test scores were used as the covariant in the achievement measure of grade point averages. ^ The population for this study was the entire student body. The sample consisted of one hundred students, randomly selected from the population. ^ The findings of the study showed there was no statistically significant difference in attitude, attendance, or the behavior of the students. Three null hypotheses were developed in the area of achievement and there was a statistically significant difference in two of the three, with a decline in achievement. ^ The results of this study indicated that the Teacher-Advisor System made no statistically significant difference in the areas investigated. Since the problem being addressed dealt with the overload of the traditional counselor role and the consequent need for alternative forms of guidance, the Teacher-Advisor System was found to be an alternative. Further study of this approach to guidance with a lesser number of uncontrolled variables might bring positive results in regard to the factors studied in this research. ...|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 75 - 76) The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} reference manual on the physiological and nutritional implications of herbal tea use for dietitians and nutritionists. The objective was to provide information on these teas that could be used when counseling patients/clients. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in herbal medicine for a myriad of sociological and economic reasons. In spite of this renewed interest, dietitians and nutritionists trained in scientific nutrition very often are not familiar with herbal tea use. This was the motivating factor in designing the reference manual. The evaluation of this project was completed by five consulting dietitians and nutritionists who read the reference manual and answered an <b>opinionnaire</b> regarding the usefulness of this project...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{similarities and}} differences in faculty and student perceptions to PBL training. Faculty at a newly formed university participated in a four day PBL workshop. A cohort of MSc. Petroleum Engineering students were PBL trained. Results from the pre/post test using a 15 item dichotomous <b>opinionnaire</b> revealed {{that there was an}} overall decrease in the number who felt that PBL was inappropriate for some disciplines, sufficient content was not taught and PBL assessment was a complicated activity. Twenty percent of participants felt more confident after training. Training eroded common myths. Students embraced change more easily than faculty. Implications for teaching and learning in the classroom are discussed. Further PBL research may be used to improve teaching and learning in the classroom...|$|E
40|$|This project {{surveyed}} evening {{students enrolled}} in the Office of Occupations Division of the Houston Community College as to their opinions concerning the effectiveness of their instructor. Of the approximately 870 students enrolled, 236 students of "professional educators " responded, and 119 students of teachers who "worked full-time in the business world " responded. A five-point <b>opinionnaire</b> was used for instructor ratings to determine if exceptional ratings were dependent on teachers ' full-time vocational classifications. The chi-square technique was used to analyze the data with a. 05 confidence level. It was found that there was no significant difference, in the opinions of the students, between the effectiveness of professional educators and those who work in the business world.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} a study of student achievement and student attitudes toward competency-based curriculum in one higA school in the Houston Independont School District. Students were asked to rate instructional modules they completed during one academic year. They were given parts of the California Achievement Test and the Vocational Preference Test (intended to measure personality factors), in addition to the Module <b>Opinionnaire.</b> The findings indicate that competency-based education's compensatory potential is not inherently limited by requirements that students have high reading skills or certain other characteristics. Student ratings of modules on factors labeled "difficult, " "useful," and "dull " are but little related to academic skills or personal characteristics of high school students.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between tezher morale and teachers' acceptance of prircipals ' authority was examined. The Zones of Indifference Instrument (ZII) {{was used to}} measure the degree of acceptance of authority, The Purdue Teacher <b>Opinionnaire</b> (PTO) was also administered to the group of Mississippi teachers to measure their morale. Usable responses were obtained from 159 teachers. The two factors of the ZII, teacher determined practice and administrator determined policy, as well as total ZII score, were significantly correlated with three PTO factors: teacher rapport with principal, teacher salary, and teacher status. The PTO factor, curriculum issues, also correlated significantly with administrator determined policy. Teacher rapport with principal and teacher load accounted for considerable variance in teachers ' attitudes trard the acceptance of authority. When the data from both tests were zompared, low scores o...|$|E

The instruments were completed by 222 University of Southern Queensland (Australia) students enrolled in distance education. The instruments were administered both before and after the semester. The responses were subjected to statistical analysis by the t-test and analysis of variance techniques. The students exhibited a high anxiety level (a sample mean of 19 out of a possible 23) and were generally more anxious about their studies after the semester than before it (a sample mean of 21 out of a possible 23). On the other hand, students ' negative feelings toward the top three factors affecting distance learning (content of study materials, finance, and readiness) decreased significantly at the en...|$|E
