Reproducible, room temperature NDR has been shown for organic devices with ultra-thin titanium dioxide layers incorporated into conventional Schottky diode structures. For industrial applications, the device fabrication process should be suitable for high-throughput processes. The specific issue is the fabrication of the <b>oxide</b> <b>layers.</b> In this work, two methods to fabricate the <b>oxide</b> <b>layers</b> were utilized: anodic oxidation and atomic layer deposition. The objective was to successfully fabricate and characterize the <b>oxide</b> <b>layers</b> and to fabricate organic tunnel diode devices. Vertical ITO/TiO 2 /semiconductor/aluminum -device structures were fabricated. The <b>oxide</b> <b>layers</b> were analyzed with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Mott Schottky analysis. Current-voltage (I-V) measurements were performed for the devices. TiO 2 layers of different thicknesses with high defect density as required for the tunneling process were successfully fabricated with the anodic oxidation method. The dielectric constant and defect density were 18 and 5 × 1019 cm- 3, respectively, for the anodized layers. Fabricated devices with anodic oxidation and ALD grown <b>oxide</b> <b>layers</b> showed an N-shaped I-V characteristic with room temperature NDR.

In spite of the higher packing densite (reduced free volume) which increases the electrochemical stability remarkably, the electrochromic response times of thin layers could be reduced to 50 ms, which is comparable to that of sputtered iridium oxide films.

All the elements of the group are reactive metals with a high melting point (1668°C, 1855°C, 2233°C, 2100°C?).

5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue.

The variations in the thickness of the <b>oxide</b> <b>layer</b> that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes. Its toxicity is much lower than that of its neighbors in the periodic table, such as lead, antimony, and polonium.|$|E
5|$|Chromium metal left {{standing}} in air is passivated by oxidation, forming a thin, protective, surface layer. This layer is a spinel structure {{only a few}} molecules thick. It is very dense, and prevents the diffusion of oxygen into the underlying metal. This {{is different from the}} oxide that forms on iron and carbon steel, through which elemental oxygen continues to migrate, reaching the underlying material to cause incessant rusting. Passivation can be enhanced by short contact with oxidizing acids like nitric acid. Passivated chromium is stable against acids. Passivation can be removed with a strong reducing agent that destroys the protective <b>oxide</b> <b>layer</b> on the metal. Chromium metal treated in this way readily dissolves in weak acids.|$|E

The existence of divalent berkelium salts is uncertain and has only been reported in mixed lanthanum chloride-strontium chloride melts. A similar behavior is observed for the lanthanide analogue of berkelium, terbium. Aqueous solutions of Bk3+ ions are green in most acids. The color of Bk4+ ions is yellow in hydrochloric acid and orange-yellow in sulfuric acid. Berkelium does not react rapidly with oxygen at room temperature, possibly due {{to the formation of}} a protective <b>oxide</b> <b>layer</b> surface.
