The last may range from loss of train of thought, to sentences only loosely connected in meaning, to speech {{that is not}} understandable known as word salad. Social withdrawal, sloppiness of dress and hygiene, and loss <b>of</b> <b>motivation</b> and judgment are all common in schizophrenia.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{symptoms}} are deficits of normal emotional responses or of other thought processes, {{and are less}} responsive to medication. They commonly include flat expressions or little emotion, poverty of speech, inability to experience pleasure, lack of desire to form relationships, and lack <b>of</b> <b>motivation.</b> Negative symptoms appear to contribute more to poor quality of life, functional ability, and the burden on others than positive symptoms do. People with greater negative symptoms often {{have a history of}} poor adjustment before the onset of illness, and response to medication is often limited.|$|E

Common symptoms include false beliefs, unclear or confused thinking, hearing voices that others do not hear, reduced social engagement and emotional expression, and a lack <b>of</b> <b>motivation.</b> People with schizophrenia often have additional mental health problems such as anxiety, depressive, or substance-use disorders.

5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It {{is the cause of}} 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss <b>of</b> <b>motivation,</b> not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|E

This article examines the <b>motivations</b> <b>of</b> employees, who are traditionally {{not involved in the}} innovation process, to (not) participate in organizational innovation communities. Building on an in-depth single case study, we aim to answer the following research questions: (1) What motivates participants of organizational innovation communities to participate? and (2) What motivates nonparticipants of organizational innovation communities to not participate? We find and categorize multiple factors that motivate non-research and development employees to participate and to not participate. Moreover, we find an overlap as well as differences in the set <b>of</b> <b>motivations</b> <b>of</b> participants and nonparticipants. With nonparticipants normally being a large but barely explicitly recognized group, we argue that the found deviations contribute to the understanding <b>of</b> <b>motivations</b> in the context of organizational innovation communities and allow for direct design implications for innovation managers...|$|R

Other motivations are rare: <b>motivation</b> <b>of</b> a particular stone as significant part <b>of</b> the landscape, <b>motivation</b> <b>of</b> building material or stone mining.

This paper contributes to an understanding <b>of</b> compliance <b>motivations</b> in two ways; first, by examining the relative influence <b>of</b> <b>motivations</b> emerging from regulatory, community, and individual contexts, and second, by applying an institutional framework that supports the complementary analysis <b>of</b> <b>motivations</b> associated with each of these different realms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The present article {{discusses}} the problem <b>of</b> separating the <b>motivation</b> concept empirically from other relevant concepts {{in research on}} mass media audiences. For about half a century, audience researchers use questionnaire items with a distinct format as measurements <b>of</b> <b>motivations</b> for media exposure. It is argued that these motivation items grammatically reflect the nature <b>of</b> the <b>motivation</b> concept as a theoretically intermediate variable between behaviour and its social or mental back-ground, thus constituting the most plausible indicators of the concept. However, it is also argued that these questionnaire items are double-barrelled and that any measurement <b>of</b> <b>motivations</b> based on the items can largely be considered an ambiguous mixture of behaviour and its social or mental origin. A study is presented that provides empirical support for this position. Key words: measurement, motivations, Uses & Gratifications, audience research, construct validit...|$|R
