She had {{discovered}} a way of using unspent torpedoes twice over, which surprised the enemy, and she had as nearly as possible been cut down by a ship which she thought was running away from her. Instead of which (she made the discovery at three thousand yards, both craft all out) the stranger steamed straight at her. [...] "The enemy then witnessed a somewhat spectacular dive at full speed from the surface to 20 feet in as many seconds. He then really did turn tail and was seen no more." [...] Going through the Straits she observed an empty troopship at anchor, but reserved her torpedoes in the hope of picking up some battleships lower down. Not finding these in the Narrows, she nosed her way back and sank the trooper, [...] "afterwards continuing journey down the Straits."

This {{question}} of the lights being lost sight of when the boat {{could not have been}} more than a quarter of a mile from the ship was a matter for much discussion. Jim stuck to it that there was nothing to be seen after the first shower had cleared away; and the others had affirmed the same thing to the officers of the Avondale. Of course people shook their heads and smiled. One old skipper who sat near me in court tickled my ear with his white beard to murmur, [...] "Of course they would lie." [...] As a matter of fact nobody lied; not even the chief engineer with his story of the mast-head light dropping like a match you throw down. Not consciously, at least. A man with his liver in such a state might very well have seen a floating spark in the corner of his eye when stealing a hurried glance over his shoulder. They had seen no light of any sort though they were well within range, and they could only explain this in one way: the ship had gone down. It was obvious and comforting. The foreseen fact coming so swiftly had justified their haste. No wonder they did not cast about for any other explanation. Yet the true one was very simple, and as soon as Brierly suggested it the court ceased to bother about the question. If you remember, the ship had been stopped, and was lying with her head on the course steered through the night, with her stern canted high and her bows brought low down in the water through the filling of the fore-compartment. Being thus <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>trim,</b> when the squall struck her a little on the quarter, she swung head to wind as sharply as though she had been at anchor. By this change in her position all her lights were in a very few moments shut off from the boat to leeward. It may very well be that, had they been seen, they would have had the effect of a mute appeal--that their glimmer lost in the darkness of the cloud would have had the mysterious power of the human glance that can awaken the feelings of remorse and pity. It would have said, [...] "I am here--still here" [...] . and what more can the eye of the most forsaken of human beings say? But she turned her back on them as if in disdain of their fate: she had swung round, burdened, to glare stubbornly at the new danger of the open sea which she so strangely survived to end her days in a breaking-up yard, as if it had been her recorded fate to die obscurely under the blows of many hammers. What were the various ends their destiny provided for the pilgrims I am unable to say; but the immediate future brought, at about nine o'clock next morning, a French gunboat homeward bound from Reunion. The report of her commander was public property. He had swept a little out of his course to ascertain what was the matter with that steamer floating dangerously by the head upon a still and hazy sea. There was an ensign, union down, flying at her main gaff (the serang had the sense to make a signal of distress at daylight); but the cooks were preparing the food in the cooking-boxes forward as usual. The decks were packed as close as a sheep-pen: there were people perched all along the rails, jammed on the bridge in a solid mass; hundreds of eyes stared, and not a sound was heard when the gunboat ranged abreast, as if all that multitude of lips had been sealed by a spell.|$|E

When it was disassembled by the Museum's team, loose nuts were found lying in one cylinder and repairs to the engine were found to be very rudimentary. It was also found that the pumps could not be disconnected and they ran constantly, resulting in great wear on the valve stems.

The M.67 carried fuel in its floats; the powerful engine drove a three-bladed propeller which created a large amount of torque. To provide extra flotation allowing smaller floats, lighter structure and less drag, fuel was carried in integral tanks built into the floats. To counter the high torque from the propeller, more fuel was carried in one float than the other, reducing swing on take-off dramatically due to reduced asymmetric hydro-dynamic drag, but also causing high <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>trim</b> forces in roll when airborne.|$|E

High throughput, cell-based, chemical library screening identified a compound (C 012) which significantly reduced melanoma cell viability, with limited toxicity for normal human fibroblasts.

As a predictable reaction, high fashion came to emphasize exquisiteness of cut and construction over denseness <b>of</b> <b>trimming,</b> and applied trim became a signifier of mass-produced clothing by the 1930s. The iconic braid and gold button <b>trim</b> <b>of</b> the Chanel suit are a notable survival <b>of</b> <b>trim</b> in high fashion.|$|R
40|$|TNF induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) {{is one of}} {{the central}} {{signaling}} pathways that plays a critical role in carcinogenesis and inflammatory diseases. Post-translational modification through ubiquitin plays important role in the regulation of this pathway. In the current study, we investigated the role <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 8, member <b>of</b> RING family ubiquitin ligase in regulation of NF-kB pathway. We observed that TRIM 8 positively regulates TNF induced NF-kB pathway. Different domains <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 8 showed discrete functions at the different steps in regulation of TNF induced NF-kB pathway. Ubiquitin ligase activity <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 8 is essential for regulation of NF-kB activation in both cytoplasm as well as nucleus. TRIM 8 negates PIAS 3 mediated negative repression of NF-kB at p 65 by inducing translocation of PIAS 3 from nucleus to cytoplasm as well as its turnover. TNF induces translocation <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 8 from nucleus to cytoplasm, which positively regulates NF-kB. The cytoplasmic translocation <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 8 is essential for TNF induced NF-kB but not for p 65 mediated NF-kB regulation. TRIM 8 also enhanced the clonogenic and migration ability of cells by modulating NF-kB. The further study will help to understand the role <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 8 in inflammation and cancer...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} the <b>trimming</b> <b>of</b> semi-finished CFRP products and a multi-material-mix <b>out</b> <b>of</b> CFRP and metal. Therefore, an abrasive waterjet {{system with a}} reduced diameter of 0. 3 mm was used. It is shown that the process is suitable for the cutting of uncured CFRP without residues. In contrast the quality <b>of</b> <b>trimmed</b> rivet holes in a cured composite cannot be accomplished by a conventional 3 -axis machining. Finally, {{it is possible to}} achieve precise cutting edges when machining the CFRP-metal compounds on a 5 -axis abrasive fine jet system...|$|R
40|$|TRIM 24 (TIF 1 α), TRIM 28 (TIF 1 β), and TRIM 33 (TIF 1 γ) {{are three}} related cofactors {{belonging}} to the tripartite motif superfamily that interact with distinct transcription factors. TRIM 24 interacts with the liganded retinoic acid (RA) receptor to repress its transcriptional activity. Germ line inactivation <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 24 in mice deregulates RA-signaling in hepatocytes leading {{to the development of}} hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here we show that TRIM 24 can be purified as at least two macromolecular complexes comprising either TRIM 33 or TRIM 33 and TRIM 28. Somatic hepatocyte-specific inactivation <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 24, TRIM 28, or TRIM 33 all promote HCC in a cell-autonomous manner in mice. Moreover, HCC formation upon TRIM 24 inactivation is strongly potentiated by further loss <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> 33. These results demonstrate that the TIF 1 -related subfamily <b>of</b> <b>TRIM</b> proteins interact both physically and functionally to modulate HCC formation in mice...|$|R
