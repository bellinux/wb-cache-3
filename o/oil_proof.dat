40|$|Now a day, the {{dependency}} of mankind on polythene {{has grown to}} larger extent because of its wide applications in storing food without allowing the moisture inside the packing and also as carry bags. But polythene is a non-biodegradable material which when buried in the soil doesn’t decompose. Because of this reason the soil looses it’s fertility due to the toxic chemicals it release {{by the action of}} temperature and also killing the micro organisms that are essential in the soil. In view of this, several attempts were made in recent years to develop paper that can show the <b>oil</b> <b>proof</b> as that of polythene. This project involves not the production of paper but the basic raw material for paper production that is pulp from banana plant (abundantly available on earth). Later this pulp can be blended with pulp obtained from bamboo which is less abundant, to obtain <b>oil</b> <b>proof</b> paper. The reason behind the selection of banana as raw material is, in banana plantations, after the fruits are harvested, the trunks or stems will be wasted. Billion tons of stem and leaves are thrown away annually. In this project we are producing pulp from banana waste stem using Kraft’s process and Soda process, also analyse the both process based on their yield, energy consumption and propose the best process...|$|E

40|$|The {{peppermint}} (Mentha piperita) and the levander (Lavandula angustifolia) are the aromatic herbs {{with the}} healing and spices effects. Their essencial oils serve to {{production of the}} aromatic substances, they {{are used in the}} cosmetic and the food industry. In this thesis were analyzed substances which are contained in levander and peppermint oils. These oils were extracted through the destillation with the water steam, next they were analyzed by the gas chromatograph and the mass spectrometer. The aim of the thesis was found which substances contain these oils. In the levander <b>oils</b> were <b>proofed</b> the highest amounts of the cineole, linalool and the linalyl-acetate. In the peppermint <b>oils</b> were <b>proofed</b> the highest amounts of the menthon and the menthol...|$|R

The bill legalized the possession {{and use of}} marijuana to treat {{a limited number of}} severe conditions, including epilepsy. The bill has no provisions for legal sale, thus requiring patients to acquire the drug outside the state of Tennessee; possession of CBD <b>oil</b> without <b>proof</b> that it was obtained legally outside of Tennessee is a misdemeanor.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAttempts to {{separate}} (–) -thujone, (+) -thujone epimers from camphor enantiomers by enantioselective HPLC with polarimetric detection In a first step, 26 chiral stationary phases (CSPs) have been screened for {{the separation of}} (–) -thujone, (+) -thujone epimers and camphor enantiomers by LC. The separations were monitored by a polarimeter detector. None of these CSPs provided a noticeable resolution for camphor enantiomers. The three components of a test mixture were clearly baseline separated on Chiralpak ASH, Chiralpak AZ-H and TCI-MBS (poly(N-alpha-(S) -methylbenzylmaleimide) coated on silica gel) in a mobile phase composed of hexane/ 2 -PrOH (99 : 1 v/v). Interestingly, for a preparative application, the three CSPs produced different elution orders for the three constituents of the mixture. In a second step, it is shown {{that the use of}} online polarimetric detection constitutes an unprecedented method to reveal the occurrence and the relative content of thujone epimers and the chirality of the major camphor enantiomer in crude essential <b>oils.</b> A <b>proof</b> of concept is illustrated on crude essential oils from Rosmarinus tournefortii, Artemisia herba alba and A. arborescens, which grow in Morocco and have several traditional uses there. In a third step, pure (+) -thujone was quantitatively collected from A. arborescens crude oil by semi-preparative HPLC on Chiralpak AZ-H monitored by a polarimeter...|$|R
5000|$|The first {{records of}} this bridge include {{a call for}} tender in 1880 by John L. Wideman of nearby St. Jacobs, Ontario for a covered bridge to span the Grand River. The cost would be shared by the Ontario Ministry of Transportation and Communications and the {{township}} of Woolwich. The contract {{was given to the}} Bear Bros., John and Benjamin. Drawings and five pages of specs were completed by John Bear who indicated that hardwood was used throughout, although the rafters and the sheets over the sides would be made of pine. The wood was obtained from the nearby villages of Bridgeport, Blair and Doon. The opening date of the bridge was 15 November 1881 but it was not painted (with [...] "residual <b>oil</b> and fire <b>proof</b> paint") until May of the following year.|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} importance of research into biomass as a feedstock for the chemical industry, {{new methods to}} reduce the oxygen content of biomass are required. Here, we present our progress {{in the field of}} the dehydration reaction, using various rhenium-based catalysts, with rhenium(VII) oxide as the most active catalyst. A wide range of allylic, aliphatic, and homoallylic alcohols have been used as substrates under relatively mild conditions (100 – 150 °C, 0. 5 mol % catalyst loading, technical toluene, ambient atmosphere) as well as various biobased terpene alcohols. Furthermore, we have applied our protocol to tea tree <b>oil</b> as a <b>proof</b> of concept for the catalytic upgrading of essential oils. The reactivity and selectivity of rhenium(VII) oxide is compared with a classical acid catalyst; sulfuric acid; and solid acid catalysts, such as acid resins, zeolites, and mesoporous materials. It was found that rhenium(VII) oxide surpasses all these catalysts in both activity and selectivity and also shows enduring activity after seven recycling runs...|$|R
40|$|Fibre {{evanescent}} wave spectroscopy (FEWS) cure monitoring {{has previously been}} demonstrated with reinforcing fibres using low refractive index epoxy systems. To enable sensing {{of a range of}} aerospace grade epoxy systems, chalcogenide fibres with high refractive index (RI) and a large infra-red (IR) transmission were used for FEWS cure monitoring. However, chalcogenides have low chemical durability and poor mechanical properties resulting in fibre fractures and degradation of the optical properties with time. The aim of the project was to produce a high RI silicate glass, suitable for near infra-red (1000 - 2500 nm) FEWS cure monitoring all possible epoxy resin systems throughout the entire curing process, whilst maintaining mechanical properties suitable for reinforcement. A range of alkali and alkali free silicate glasses and epoxy systems were produced and their refractive indices optically characterised using ellipsometry. The glasses were thermally analysed for the liquidus and fibre forming temperatures for fiberisation. A fibre up-drawing jig was constructed and custom glass fibres were drawn. The composition was then mechanically characterised, demonstrating mechanical properties similar to reinforcing fibres. Subsequently, the fibres were embedded into sunflower oil, liquid epoxy systems and epoxy pre-preg systems. Sunflower <b>oil</b> systems demonstrated <b>proof</b> of FEWS sensing showing excellent peak correlation. Liquid epoxy systems were successfully cure monitored by FEWS. Pre-preg systems did not display FEWS peaks, but were monitored using light intensity...|$|R
40|$|The study {{presents}} {{the characteristics of}} oil fraction of 8 types of edible nuts available on the Polish market. All tested nuts were characterized with high content of dry matter. Fatty acid and sterol composition was analyzed by GC-MS. Squalene and tocopherol profiles were examined by HPLC with diode array (DAD) and fluorescence detectors (FLDs). The highest level of fat was found in macadamia (75. 4 g/ 100 g) and the lowest in cashew nuts (46. 9 g/ 100 g). Fatty analysis showed that nuts were rich in unsaturated fatty acids. Monounsaturated fatty acids were predominant in most cases, {{with the exception of}} Brazilian nuts, walnuts and pine nuts which were richer in polyunsaturated fatty acids. β-Sitosterol was the main sterol of nuts, and its content ranged from 96. 9 mg/ 100 g of oil (in macadamia) to 474. 8 mg/ 100 g of oil (in pistachio). γ-Tocopherol homologue was predominant among its fraction with the largest content determined in pistachio (8. 3 mg/ 100 g of oil) and walnuts (8. 6 mg/ 100 g of oil). The presence of squalene was confirmed in seven types of nuts, and the richest source of it were Brazilian nuts (145. 8 mg/ 100 g of <b>oil).</b> The study <b>proofs</b> the variation of nut oil composition, especially phytosterol and tocopherol content and can be used for better characterization of nuts derived from different geographic areas or cultivars...|$|R
40|$|Despite of the {{extensive}} research around spark erosion of ceramics over the last 3 decades, the particular investigation on micro-EDM capabilities in ceramic machining is in the early stage and requires further study [1]. In this work, the micromachining performance of various ceramics, with mechanical properties ranging from high toughness and strength to exceptional hardness and wear resistance, are examined. They include two commercially available materials, a ZrO 2 -TiN ceramic composite and a TiB 2 grade, and an Al 3 O 2 -TiCN lab-scale composite. Experiments were conducted on a SARIX SX- 100 -HPM micro EDM-milling centre in hydrocarbon oil and de-ionized water. WC and brass cylindrical rods, 0. 3 mm and 0. 5 mm in diameter, respectively, were used as the tool electrodes. Negative tool polarity was applied through all experiments. Design of Experiments (DoE) methodologies were employed to systematically investigate {{the influence of the}} machine parameters on the volumetric material removal rate (MRR), relative tool wear (TWR) and surface quality (roughness of the primary profile, Pa). Accordingly, suitable process parameters for the efficient micromachining of the materials at low and medium/high energy conditions could be identified. Similar variation trends to the machining of steel were generally observed; the increasing of the pulse energy leads to higher machining rate, but also to worse surface finishing. The ZrO 2 -TiN and Al 3 O 2 -TiCN composites in oil dielectric provided the most efficient results; the MRR increased up to 0. 3 mm 3 /min {{in the case of the}} zirconia composite at high discharge conditions, the TWR remained below 10 % in both cases, and surface roughness less than 0. 2 m could be achieved by gradually reducing the pulse energy. On the contrary, the TiB 2 shows the worst machining performance with TWR peak of 70 % in oil dielectric and machining rate down to 0. 1 mm 3 /min. Surface roughness less than 0. 35 m were easily achievable on all three materials. As generally comparison against to the processing of Si 3 N 4 –TiN ceramic composite, machining efficiency and tool performance are lower, while the surface quality improves to a large extent [2]. The surface topography and cross section of the EDM samples were inspected with the aid of a SEM; additionally, X-ray energy dispersive spectrometry (X-ray EDS) was performed to characterise the chemical composition of the specimens. Melting and evaporation are recognized as the prevailing material removal mechanisms during machining of Zr 2 O 2 -TiN and Al 3 O 2 -TICN ceramic composites; the recast layers are characterized by the formation of regular craters of increasing diameter with the rising of the pulse energy and within the range of ~ 7 - 50 m (Fig. 1). The presence of cracks was also observed, especially in the alumina composite due to the lowest toughness and strength; the cracks propagate parallel to the surface leading to the detachment of large flakes, even at low energy conditions (Fig. 2). With the variation of the type of dielectric and discharge conditions, different material removal mechanisms, including oxidation, melting and spalling, were observed during machining of TiB 2 samples. Oxidation specifically occurs during the process in de-ionized water at short discharge duration; the formation of TiO 2 and B 2 O 3, which evaporates above 1200 °C, give as result an oxygen-rich, and boron-poor, spongy like structure, weekly attached to the bulk. The damage induced is severe and the generation of cracks deeply propagating vertically into the bulk is observed. On the contrary, melting and spalling become predominant during the process in water as the pulse duration and energy increase [3]. Droplets of molten material are visible on the EDM layer; additionally, pieces of material break off from the surface leading to the exposure of the underlying grains (Fig. 3). No material removal mechanisms different from melting and spalling were observed during machining of TiB 2 in <b>oil</b> dielectric. As <b>proof</b> of the strategies developed, various demonstrators were fabricated. As an example, a 6 mm Ø aerodynamic thrust bearing surface was realized in ZrO 2 -TiN (Fig. 4). The component has a 2 D 1 / 2 structure of geometry similar to a compressor; the curved grooves are 15 m deep and 200 m wide at the rounded tip. A layer by layer approach with a depth of cut of 0. 5 m was employed as milling strategy; the component fabrication took approximately 40 minutes. The geometries of all the grooves show very good consistency and geometric accuracy within +/- 2 m. The component is illustrative of the potential applications that can be developed, such as wear resistance moulds and micro machinery components. status: publishe...|$|R
