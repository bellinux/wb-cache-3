40|$|Most {{surgeons}} use <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> in laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The {{aim of this}} prospective {{randomized controlled}} study was to evaluate the efficacy of absorbable clips in elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. One hundred consecutive patients with symptomatic gallstones without complications were randomized into groups; group T had two <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> (titan clip ETHICONR), group R (laproclipR Davis and Geck) had one absorbable clip applied on the cystic duct and cystic artery. The patients were followed for one year. There {{was no difference between}} the two groups concerning operative time, hospital stay and postoperative complications. The absorbable clips seem to be as effective as <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> in providing hemostasis in cystic artery and in cystic duct ligation...|$|R
40|$|In {{perforator}} flap reconstruction, vascular mapping using preoperative {{computed tomography}} (CT) angiography {{is widely used}} to confirm the existence and location of an appropriate perforator. This study proposes a rapid, accurate, and convenient method for marking the perforator location on the skin surface. For 12 patients who underwent perforator flap reconstruction between November 2011 and November 2013, <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> were fixed on the skin surface at the anticipated perforator locations, which were decided using a handheld Doppler. CT angiography {{was used to compare}} the location between the <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> and the actual perforator. The <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> was moved and repositioned, if needed, {{on the basis of the}} CT images. The locations of the appropriate perforator and the <b>metal</b> <b>clip,</b> which were observed during the surgery, were then compared. In CT angiography, the mean distance between the <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> and the perforator was 3 ± 3. 9 mm, and the mean distance that was measured during surgery was 0. 8 ± 0. 8 mm. In conclusion, we report a simple, rapid, and precise technique to indicate the accurate location of the appropriate perforator on the skin surface...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{represents}} {{a case study}} which focuses on Poka Yoke which is a concept coined by Japanese people. We have studied a system that eliminated the rework and increased productivity of the plant which results in achievement of 0 PPM as well; in the company based in Satpur, Nashik. There was a punching machine there in the plant which was punching a hole on a rear end cap of Mahindra Scorpio’s rear bumper. There were 4 <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> which were fitted on that component before the part gets punched on punching machine. After some of the lots get punched, we observed that component is getting punched unless those clip fittings. At that time, company needs more time to fit <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> on the component again which was time consuming. So this problem can be avoided by implementing Poka Yoke system to it. So, {{the aim of the}} project was avoid the mistake of missing of <b>metal</b> <b>clip</b> on it and make a system which will not allow to punch the hole unless and until all 4 <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> are arranged on it...|$|R

40|$|A Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) generic {{model has}} been {{developed}} for the Thai fermented pork sausage or Nham process. Sodium nitrite, <b>metal</b> <b>clip,</b> and pathogens were identified as chemical, physical, and microbiological hazards in this product, respectively. Four steps in the Nham process {{have been identified as}} critical control points. These steps are the weighing nitrite, stuffing, fermentation, and labeling. Chemical hazard of nitrite must be controlled during weighing. Critical limit of nitrite levels in the Nham mixture has been set at I 00 - 200 ppm. Physical hazard from <b>metal</b> <b>clips</b> could be prevented by visual inspection of every Nham product during stuffing. Microbiological hazard in Nham could be reduced in the fermentation process until the pH reach 4. 6. Since this product is uncooked during processing, finally, educating the consumer, by providing safety information on the label, could be an alternative way to prevent the microbiological hazards of this product...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To explore {{endoscopic}} therapy {{methods for}} gastric stromal tumors originating from the muscularis propria. METHODS: For 69 cases diagnosed as gastric stromal tumors originating from the muscularis propria, {{three types of}} endoscopic therapy were selected, based {{on the size of}} the tumor. These methods included endoscopic ligation and resection (ELR), endoscopic submucosal excavation (ESE) and endoscopic full-thickness resection (EFR). The wound surface and the perforation of the gastric wall were closed with <b>metal</b> <b>clips.</b> Immunohistostaining for CD 34, CD 117, Dog- 1, S- 100 and smooth muscle actin (SMA) was performed on the resected tumors. RESULTS: A total of 38 cases in which the tumor size was less than 1. 2 cm were treated with ELR; three cases were complicated by perforation, and the perforations were closed with <b>metal</b> <b>clips.</b> Additionally, 18 cases in which the tumor size was more than 1. 5 cm were treated with ESE, and no perforation occurred. Finally, 13 cases in which the tumor size was more than 2. 0 cm were treated with EFR; all of the cases were complicated by artificial perforation, and all of the perforations were closed with <b>metal</b> <b>clips.</b> All of the 69 cases recovered with medical treatment, and none required surgical operation. Immunohistostaining demonstrated that among all of the 69 gastric stromal tumors diagnosed by gastroscopy, 12 cases were gastric leiomyomas (SMA-positive), and the other 57 cases were gastric stromal tumors. CONCLUSION: Gastric stromal tumors originating from the muscularis propria can be treated successfully with endoscopic techniques, which could replace certain surgical operations and should be considered for further application...|$|R
