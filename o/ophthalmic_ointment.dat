40|$|A Master's Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy at Loughborough University. The literature relating to the contamination of <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>ointments</b> has been reviewed. The survival of microorganisms deliberately incorporated into various eye ointments has been studied, both qualitatively and quantitatively, for organisms in pure and mixed culture. The use of isopropyl myristate (IPM) as a dilutent for nonaqueous products during the isolation (membrane filtration) of contaminating organisms has been examined. Both sterile filtered and autoclaved IPM were used. Plastic and aluminium containers (tubes) were compared on an in-use, swept volume basis as part of contamination control, IPM did not interfere with organism recovery and results suggest that bacteria may survive for several days in such ointments. Observations are discussed {{with respect to the}} need for the inclusion of an added preservative in <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>ointments...</b>|$|R

He originally presented to the rDVM on 6 / 21 / 04 for non-painful superficial lymphadenopathy, and was diagnosed on fine needle aspirate (FNA) with presumptive reactive (inflammatory) lymphoid hyperplasia. He returned to rDVM on 6 / 25 / 04 with same clinical signs, as well as, a prolapsed nictitating membrane on his left eye. Repeat FNA of, at this time, a different node still suggested reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. Three weeks on systemic and <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>ointments</b> did not resolve the clinical signs, so he was referred to Cornell University for a referral for possible Lymphoma. On 7 / 12 / 04, he was worked up for presumptive lymphoma. Physical exam revealed the same clinical signs previously described, as well as, tonsillar enlargement and two subcutaneous masses. A critical factor in the initial diagnosis was the CBC. It showed evidence of possible myeloid leukemia (blasts in circulation). The main focus of the case presentation will be on explaining the terminology used to describe Lymphoma and Leukemia.

40|$|Abstract Background In 1996 the {{guideline}} 'The Red Eye' {{was first}} published by the Dutch College of General Practitioners. The extent to which general practitioners adhere to this guideline is unclear. Recently, data on the management of infectious conjunctivitis by general practitioners became available from the Second Dutch National Survey of General Practice. We measured the age-specific incidence of infectious conjunctivitis, described its management by Dutch general practitioners, and then compared these findings with the recommendations made in the guideline. Methods In 2001, over a 12 -month period, data from all patient contacts with 195 general practitioners were taken from electronic medical records. Registration was episode-oriented; all consultations dealing with the same health problem were grouped into disease episodes. Data concerning all episodes of infectious conjunctivitis (ICPC-code F 70 and sub codes) were analysed. Results Over one year, 5, 213 new and recurrent episodes of infectious conjunctivitis were presented to general practitioners from a population of N = 375, 899, resulting in an overall incidence rate of 13. 9 per 1000 person-years, varying from more than 80 / 1000 py in children up to one-year old, to less than 12 / 1000 py in children {{over the age of}} 4. Topical <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>ointments</b> were prescribed in 87 % of the episodes, of which 80 % was antibiotic treatment. Fusidic acid gel was most frequently prescribed (69 %). In most episodes general practitioners did not adhere to the guideline. Conclusion In 2001, the management of infectious conjunctivitis by Dutch general practitioners was not in accordance with the recommendations of the consensus-based guideline published five years previously, despite its wide distribution. In 2006 this guideline was revised. Its successful implementation requires more than distribution alone. Probably {{the most effective way to}} achieve this is by following a model for systemic implementation. </p...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of silver}} nitrate as {{prophylaxis}} for neonatal ophthalmia was instituted {{in the late}} 1800 s to prevent the devastating effects of neonatal ocular infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae. At that time – during the preantibiotic era – many countries made such prophylaxis mandatory by law. Today, neonatal gonococcal ophthalmia is rare in Canada, but ocular prophylaxis for this condition remains mandatory in some provinces/ territories. Silver nitrate drops are no longer available and erythromycin, the only <b>ophthalmic</b> antibiotic eye <b>ointment</b> currently available for use in newborns, is of questionable efficacy. Ocular prophylaxis is not effective in preventing chlamydial conjunctivitis. Applying medication to the eyes of newborns may result in mild eye irritation and has been perceived by some parents as interfering with mother-infant bonding. Physicians caring for newborns should advocate for rescinding mandatory ocular prophylaxis laws. More effective means of preventing ophthalmia neonatorum include screening all pregnant women for gonorrhea and chlamydia infection, and treatment and follow-up of those found to be infected. Mothers who were not screened should be tested at delivery. Infants of mothers with untreated gonococcal infection at delivery should receive ceftriaxone. Infants exposed to chlamydia at delivery should be followed closely for signs of infection...|$|R
5000|$|The stings {{of the red}} {{imported}} {{fire ant}} in animals are painful and sometimes life-threatening. In dogs, stings from the red imported fire ant can cause pustular dermatosis, a condition where pustules appear in crops {{as a result of}} the ant sting. After getting stung, the immediate response consists of erythema and swelling. The pustules remain for approximately 24 hours, whereas in humans they can last for several days. In livestock, red imported ants mostly sting animals in regions with no hair, particularly around the ears, eyes, muzzle, the perineum and ventral portion of the abdomen. Newborn or young livestock can be blinded or killed when attacked by the ants. Healthy individuals are less likely to be attacked than weak or sick animals. Red papule and mild swelling occur, followed by vesicopustule with a red halo developing within 24 to 48 hours. The eyes and eyelids are commonly damaged from the stings; in sheep and goats, <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>ointment</b> containing antibiotics and corticosteroids can be used to treat the eyes of sheep and goats, but this treatment is not recommended for horses. In non-domestic animals, cases of red imported fire ants stings in animals such as ferrets, moles squirrels, white-tailed deer, cottontail rabbits, and newborn blackbucks have been reported, as well as lizards and screech owl nestlings. The aftermath of the injuries is like those in domestic animals.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the rate of periocular allergic skin reactions to topical neomycin, polymyxin B, and dexamethasone (NPD) <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>ointment.</b> METHODS: A consecutive patient prospective study was performed. A total of 522 patients who had a procedure involving incision of the periocular skin with subsequent postoperative application of NPD <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>ointment</b> were included. Patients were evaluated for signs of allergy at 1 week postoperatively or prior if the patient had complaints. A periocular allergic reaction was defined as any periocular skin pruritus, erythema, edematous papules, vesicles, or plaques at the site of ointment application beyond that of the typical postprocedure presentation. The patients continued to be monitored for 30 days postoperatively. RESULTS: Of the 522 patients who completed the study, eight (1. 5 %) had a definitive periocular allergic contact dermatitis to the NPD <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>ointment.</b> Allergic presentation ranged from postoperative day 3 to 14. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of periocular allergic reactions to NPD <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>ointment</b> is significantly lower than reported in the literature for other topical preparations of neomycin and polymyxin B. The low rate of allergy in this study suggests that NPD <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>ointment</b> can safely be applied to the periocular skin with a very minimal risk of inciting an allergic reaction...|$|E
40|$|Ophthalmia neonatorum {{is defined}} as {{conjunctivitis}} occurring within the first 4 weeks of life. While there are many causes of ophthalmia neonatorum, Neisseria gonorrhoeae is most commonly associated with more severe disease. As is true in most states, Alaska law requires that a prophylactic agent be instilled {{into the eyes of}} all newborn infants to prevent gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum. Erythromycin (0. 5 %) <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>ointment</b> is the recommended prophylactic treatment of choice. On August 31, 2009, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicated that there is a national shortage of erythromycin (0. 5 %) <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>ointment.</b> According to CDC, the shortage is due to a change in manufacturers. Fera Pharmaceuticals, which recently acquired the rights to erythromycin (0. 5 %) <b>ophthalmic</b> <b>ointment,</b> and Bausch & Lomb, which also manufactures the product, are working with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to increase production and supply.
