5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{is one of}} the ten most visited {{national}} parks in the U.S., with an annual average of 2.75million visitors in the period from 2007 to 2016, with 3.27 million visiting in 2016. The National Park Service is a federal agency of the United States Department of the Interior and manages both Grand Teton National Park and the John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway. Grand Teton National Park has an average of 100 permanent and 180 seasonal employees. The park also manages 27 concession contracts that provide services such as lodging, restaurants, mountaineering guides, dude ranching, fishing and a boat shuttle on Jenny Lake. The National Park Service works closely with other federal agencies such as the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Reclamation, and also, in consequence of Jackson Hole Airport's presence in the park, the Federal Aviation Administration. Initial construction of the airstrip north of the town of Jackson was completed in the 1930s. When Jackson Hole National Monument was designated, the airport was inside it. After the monument and park were combined, the Jackson Hole Airport became the only commercial airport within a U.S. National Park. Jackson Hole Airport has some of the strictest noise abatement regulations of any airport in the U.S. The airport has night flight curfews and <b>overflight</b> restrictions, with pilots being expected to approach and depart the airport along the east, south or southwest flight corridors. As of 2010, 110 privately owned property inholdings, many belonging to the state of Wyoming, are located within Grand Teton National Park. Efforts to purchase or trade these inholdings for other federal lands are ongoing and through partnerships with other entities, 10million dollars is hoped to be raised to acquire private inholdings by 2016. Some monies are allocated from congress via the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but Grand Teton National Park may not get all the money needed from the fund as it is divided up between four different federal agencies. Efforts to exchange federal land from other areas for inholdings were still in the negotiation phase in 2012.|$|E

40|$|The Fortymile Caribou Herd (FCH) is {{the most}} {{prominent}} caribou herd in interior Alaska. A {{large portion of the}} FCH calving and summer range lies beneath heavily used Military Operations Areas (MOA) that are important for flight training. We observed the behavior of Grant’s cow caribou (Rangifer tarandus granti) and their calves before, during, and immediately following low-level military jet <b>overflights.</b> We also monitored movements of radiocollared cow caribou and survival of their calves. We conducted fieldwork from mid May through early June 2002. We concluded that military jet <b>overflights</b> did not cause deaths of caribou calves in the FCH during the calving period nor result in increased movements of cow–calf pairs over the 24 -hour period following exposure to <b>overflights.</b> Short-term responses to <b>overflights</b> were generally mild in comparison to caribou reactions to predators or perceived predators. Caribou responses to <b>overflights</b> were variable, but responses were generally greater as slant distances decreased and jet speeds increased. A- 10 jets caused less reaction than F- 15 s and F- 16 s. Although we found that short-term reactions of caribou to jet <b>overflights</b> were mild, we advise against assuming there are no long-term effects on calving caribou from jet <b>overflights...</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1969, the US Air Force redesignated {{the model}} number (see chart below), {{although}} the Ryan number kept their popularity.Back in South-east Asia, Lightning Bugs continued their <b>overflights.</b> A number of missions {{focused on a}} prisoner of war (POW) camp near the city of Son Tay in North Vietnam, in order to determine if US POWs were being held there. The drone <b>overflights</b> of the Son Tay camp were halted in favor of <b>overflights</b> with the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird spyplane, since US intelligence officials felt that too many drone <b>overflights</b> might make the enemy suspicious. Apparently they did, since when the camp was finally raided on November 21, 1970 during Operation Ivory Coast, there were no American POWs there. It was a disappointing result to one of the more daring operations of the war.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1999 To {{assess the}} impact of low-altitude jet <b>overflights</b> on parental care, we {{examined}} nest attendance, time-activity budgets, and provisioning rates of 21 Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) pairs breeding along the Tanana River, Alaska in 1995 and 1996. Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors influenced attributes of nesting behavior. Female nest attendance declined substantially with progression of the nesting cycle, while male attendance patterns were consistent throughout the nesting cycle. Further, although females typically performed most of the incubating, male attendance at the nest area varied considerably among breeding pairs. Both prey item delivery rates and estimated prey mass delivery rates increased with brood size. Prey item delivery rates per nestling, however, decreased with increasing brood size; yet estimated prey mass delivery rates per nestling did not vary with brood size. Peregrine Falcons apparently maintained constant provisioning rates per nestling as brood size increased by increasing average prey size. We found evidence that nest attendance and time-activity budgets of Peregrine Falcons differed during periods of <b>overflights</b> compared with reference nests, but differences depended on stage of the nesting cycle and gender. Males had lower nest ledge attendance during periods when <b>overflights</b> occurred than males from reference nests when data from the incubation and early nestling-rearing stages of the nesting cycle were combined. Females apparently compensated for lower male ledge attendance by attending the ledge more during overflown periods compared to females from reference nests, although this trend was not significant. During late nestling-rearing, however, females perched in the nest area less during periods when <b>overflights</b> occurred than females from reference nests. We did not see a relationship between nest attendance and the number of <b>overflights,</b> the cumulative number of exposures experienced by each nesting pair, or the average sound exposure level of <b>overflights.</b> Nor did we find evidence that nestling provisioning rates were affected by <b>overflights.</b> Low altitude jet <b>overflights</b> did not markedly affect nest attendance, time-activity budgets, or nestling provisioning rates of breeding Peregrine Falcons...|$|R

25|$|US Navy Rear Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd led five {{expeditions to}} Antarctica during the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. He overflew the South Pole with pilot Bernt Balchen on November 28 and 29, 1929, {{to match his}} <b>overflight</b> of the North Pole in 1926.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 In {{order to}} examine the {{potential}} impact of military jet <b>overflights</b> and other disturbances on productivity of peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), we observed behavioral reactions of peregrines to disturbances at nests along the Tanana River, Alaska during the 1995 - 1997 breeding seasons. Military jets conducted low-altitude flights over a sample of nests under observation in each year (experimental nests), while other nests were not intentionally overflown (reference nests). Other disturbances occurred at random. Animal noise monitors (ANMs), which collect and store data on noise disturbance levels, were deployed at each observed nest. A total of 878 above-threshold (≥ 85 dB) <b>overflights</b> were recorded by the ANMs {{during the course of the}} study. A total of 401 close (defined as ≤ 1000 m slant distance from the nest) <b>overflights</b> by subsonic F- 16, F- 15, A- 10, Harrier, Jaguar, or Tornado jet aircraft were recorded during observations.

25|$|Although {{originally}} designed to succeed the U-2 in <b>overflights</b> over the Soviet Union and Cuba, the A-12 was never used for either role. After a U-2 was shot down in May 1960, the Soviet Union was considered too dangerous to overfly except in an emergency (and <b>overflights</b> were no longer necessary, thanks to reconnaissance satellites) and, although crews trained for flights over Cuba, U-2s continued to be adequate there.|$|R
25|$|In general, Finland was {{stationed}} in a strategic and neutral position between the Cold War blocks and both sides engaged in intensive intelligence activities in Finland. Mostly, Finland was an interest to the superpowers as a buffer zone and as an <b>overflight</b> and military transit route. During the first decades, the main tasks of Supo were to monitor communists, such as the Communist Party of Finland and home Russians, and prevent illegal intelligence, especially KGB and GRU espionage. The Service {{had to work with}} discretion and caution, balancing between independence and appeasement, due to finlandization. At the same time, Supo had close connections with the CIA—although the Service was wary of recording it on paper.|$|E
25|$|Eisenhower refused CIA pleas in September 1956 to reauthorize overflights of Eastern Europe but the Hungarian Revolution in November, and {{his reelection}} that month, caused the {{president}} to permit flights over border areas. Soviet interceptors continued to fail to reach the U-2s but, after the Soviets protested a December <b>overflight</b> of Vladivostok by RB-57Ds, Eisenhower again forbade communist overflights. Flights close to the border continued, now including the first ELINT-equipped U-2s. In May 1957, Eisenhower again authorized overflights over certain important Soviet missile and atomic facilities. He continued to personally authorize each flight, closely examining maps and sometimes making changes to the flight plan. By 1957, one of the European units was based at Giebelstadt, and the far eastern unit was based at the Naval Air Facility Atsugi, Japan.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, {{the fallout}} plume from the Castle Bravo nuclear test passed over Bikar about 20 {{hours after the}} shot. Based on ash from plant samples taken on March 9, the atoll was {{contaminated}} by about 1,400,000 d/m/gm of radioactive material, compared with 35,000,000 d/m/gm from the most contaminated soil samples at Rongelap Atoll, and 950 d/m/gm at Majuro Atoll, several hundred {{miles south of the}} fallout pattern. This experience led to a pre-planned aerial survey of atolls adjacent to the subsequent March 27 Castle Romeo test, timed at one and four hours after the shot. The aircraft were equipped with gamma radiation detectors designed to measure ground contamination from altitudes of 200 to 500 feet. An <b>overflight</b> of Bikar Island measured 0.1 mrem/hr (1 μGy) an hour after the shot, rising to 15 mrem/hr (150 μGy) three hours later.|$|E

25|$|From October 1960, Detachment G {{made many}} overflights of Cuba from Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas. Although Lockheed {{modified}} six CIA aircraft into the aerial refueling-capable U-2F model in 1961, permitting some Cuba missions to originate from Edwards, pilot fatigue limited flights to about 10 hours. An August 1962 flight showed Soviet SA-2 SAM {{sites on the}} island; later overflights found more sites and MiG-21 interceptors. The increasing number of SAMs caused the United States to more cautiously plan Cuban overflights. USAF U-2s did not conduct overflights, but officials believed {{that it would be}} better for a military officer to be the pilot in case he was shot down. Following one last Cuba <b>overflight</b> that originated from Edwards and ended at McCoy Air Force Base, Florida on 14 October 1962, all further U-2 operations over Cuba originated from a detachment operating location that was established at McCoy.|$|E
25|$|When {{faced with}} refusals of basing and <b>overflight</b> rights from {{continental}} European countries during Operation El Dorado Canyon, the U.S. {{was forced to}} use the UK-based F-111s in the 1986 air-strikes against Libya. The KC-10s and KC-135s allowed 29 F-111s, along with other Air Force and Navy aircraft, to reach their targets. The KC-10 again {{played a key role}} during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm in 1991; KC-10s facilitated the deployment of tactical, strategic, and transport aircraft to Saudi Arabia. In the early stages of Operation Desert Shield, aerial refueling was key to the rapid airlift of materiel and forces. In addition to refueling airlift aircraft, the KC-10, along with the smaller KC-135, moved thousands of tons of cargo and thousands of troops in support of the massive buildup. The KC-10 and the KC-135 conducted about 51,700 separate refueling operations and delivered 125 million gallons (475 million liters) of fuel without missing a single scheduled rendezvous.|$|E
25|$|The camera {{platforms}} {{included a}} modified Citroën sedan, camera trucks, helicopters and a flying rig constructed by Dick Parker. Parker had built it for model sequences in Strategic Air Command (1955). The rig {{consisted of two}} construction cranes and a hydraulically operated device to tilt and position a model, along with 200ft (61m) of cables. Parker's rig allowed actors to sit inside full-scale models suspended 50ft (15m) above the ground, yet provide safety and realism for staged flying sequences, with the sky realistically in the background. A further hydraulic platform did away with matte shots of aircraft in flight. The platform was large enough to mount an aircraft and Parker or stunt pilots could manipulate its controls for realistic bluescreen sequences. Composite photography was used when scenes called for difficult shots; these were completed at Pinewood Studios. Some shots were created with rudimentary cockpits and noses grafted to an Alouette helicopter. One scene over Paris was staged with small models when Paris refused an <b>overflight.</b> However, {{for the majority of}} flying scenes, full-scale flying aircraft were employed.|$|E

At the time of the <b>overflights,</b> the reflectance of the calibration target was measured with a field spectrometer. In addition, the atmospheric optical depths and water vapor abundance were measured from a radiometer station adjacent to the calibration target. These in-situ measurements were used to constrain the MODTRAN radiative transfer code to model the upwelling spectral radiance incident to the sensor aperture during the <b>overflights.</b> Analyses of this modeled radiance in conjunction with the laboratory-calibrated radiance were used to determine the spectral and radiometric calibration of AVIRIS while in flight...|$|R
