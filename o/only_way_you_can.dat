500|$|... "Honesty" [...] is a piano ballad with {{synthesizer}} embellishments. It {{opens with}} [...] "sad and tender" [...] piano chords. According to Ken Bielen {{in his book}} The Words and Music of Billy Joel, Liberty DeVitto's drums and cymbal crashes, remind listeners that [...] "the track is a predecessor of the power ballads of the 1980s and 1990s". It talks about the inherent lack of honesty even in the closest of relationships. In the song Joel sings the lines [...] "Honesty is such a lonely word". Joel further sings about wearing his heart on his sleeve in [...] "Honesty". According to Chuck Klosterman of The New York Times, [...] " [...] implies that the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> tell that someone really cares about you is if they tell you you're bad." [...] "Leningrad" [...] (1989), a song from Joel's eleventh studio album Storm Front, {{has been compared to}} [...] "Honesty". According to the sheet music published on the website Musicnotes.com by Faber Music, [...] "Honesty" [...] is a pop rock and classical rock song written in the key of B♭ major. The song is set in common time and performed in a slow tempo of 80 beats per minute. Joel vocals range from the note of Bb2 to Bb4.|$|E
500|$|The 2010 TIP {{report also}} {{condemned}} Canada's {{lack of a}} national action plan, and said that Canada is a destination, source, and transit country for forced prostitution, unfree labour, the prostitution of children, {{and other forms of}} human trafficking. The report said that the federal and provincial governments of Canada were not cooperating sufficiently with respect to policing these crimes, and that a strategy for cooperation should be formulated in a national action plan. York Regional Police vice unit Detective Thai Truong agreed with the report's assessment, and said that [...] "a unified understanding and approach" [...] to human trafficking [...] "does not even exist at the municipal level of policing" [...] in Canada. Also in 2010, retired Toronto Police Service officer Dave Perry said that Canada's lack of a national action plan had resulted in the country failing to adequately deal with North Preston's Finest, a gang that engages in sex trafficking between Nova Scotia and Toronto. Perry had led a police taskforce against the gang in the late 1980s and early 1990s, but he said that without a national action plan, politicians lost interest in the endeavour and funding ran out. Perry stated that a plan would need to be well-funded because traffickers in Canada are making [...] "big, big money...and the <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> combat that is with a pretty healthy budget." ...|$|E

Though the accident left the band shaken, none of the members sustained serious injury – Tony and Cedric were taken to the hospital for minor injuries and released. In January 2001, At the Drive-In traveled to Australia for the Big Day Out music festival. While performing in Sydney, they left partway through their set after telling the attendance to calm down and observe the safety rules against moshing. After the refusal of the crowd, frontman Cedric Bixler-Zavala told them [...] "You're a robot, you're a sheep!"

2500|$|Goodfellas {{is based}} on New York crime {{reporter}} Nicholas Pileggi's book Wiseguy. Martin Scorsese {{did not intend to}} make another mob film until he saw a review of Pileggi's book, which he then read while working on the set of Color of Money in 1986. He had always been fascinated by the Mob lifestyle and was drawn to Pileggi's book because it was the most honest portrayal of gangsters he had ever read. After reading Pileggi's book, the filmmaker knew what approach he wanted to take: [...] "To begin Goodfellas like a gunshot and have it get faster from there, almost like a two-and-a-half-hour trailer.

[...] According to Pileggi, Scorsese cold-called the writer and told him, [...] "I've been waiting for this book my entire life", to which Pileggi replied, [...] "I've been waiting for this phone call my entire life".|$|E

McReynolds refused to speak to Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish member of the Court, for three years {{following}} Brandeis's appointment and, when Brandeis retired in 1939, did not sign the customary dedicatory letter sent to justices on their retirement. He habitually left the conference room whenever Brandeis spoke. When Benjamin Cardozo's appointment was being pressed on President Herbert C. Hoover, McReynolds joined with fellow justices Pierce Butler and Willis Van Devanter in urging the White House not to [...] "afflict the Court with another Jew". When news of Cardozo's appointment was announced, McReynolds is claimed to have said [...] "Huh, {{it seems that the}} <b>only</b> <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> get on the Supreme Court these days is to be either the son of a criminal or a Jew, or both." [...] During Cardozo's swearing-in ceremony, McReynolds pointedly read a newspaper, and would often hold a brief or record {{in front of his face}} when Cardozo delivered an opinion from the bench.
