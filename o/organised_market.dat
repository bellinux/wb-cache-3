40|$|Artículos en revistasThe {{problem of}} {{ensuring}} that there is enough generation capacity to meet future demand has been an issue in market design {{since the beginning of}} the deregulation process. Although ideally the market itself should be enough to provide adequate investment incentives, there are several factors that prevent this result from being achieved, and some actual markets have already experienced problems related with a lack of generation capacity. A regulatory framework to address this question is presented. The procedure is based on an <b>organised</b> <b>market</b> where reliability contracts (based on financial call options) are auctioned, so both their price and their allocation among the different plants are determined through competitive mechanisms. This results in a stabilisation of the income of the generators and provides a clear incentive for new generation investment, with a minimum of regulatory intervention. Additionally, the method represents a market-compatible mechanism to hedge demand from the occurrence of high market prices. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the role the shadow banking system played in the {{financial}} crisis of 2007 – 9. Engaging with emergent theories of shadow banking, I inquire into its structural role in contemporary capitalism. My main premise {{here is that the}} crisis of 2007 – 9 is distinct in financial history because it did not centre on any <b>organised</b> <b>market.</b> Rather, it was crisis of the overcrowded financial channels bridging the present and the future, which have become congested because of the massive concentration of financial values generated, yet not sustained, through the shadow banking network. My analysis suggests that shadow banking has determined the nature of financial crisis of 2007 – 9 and continues to play a necessary role in financial capitalism based on futurity. Drawing on scholarship in financial Keynesianism, contemporary legal studies and early evolutionary political economy, I argue that shadow banking is best seen as the organic institutional infrastructure of financialised capitalism based on debt and geared towards futurity, a concept originally developed by John Commons...|$|E
40|$|The {{agricultural}} policies shift gradually from EU-level <b>organised</b> <b>market</b> {{interventions to}} local organised environmental policies. This paper explores the growth {{possibilities of the}} Flemish dairy sector with the outlook of a quota abolishment {{as a case study}} of this policy shift. The dairy quota policy seems very restrictive for the highly profitable Flemish dairy sector, but the environmental restrictions from the manure regulation can limit the growth of the dairy sector as well. The paper uses a spatial multi-agent simulation model applied to a sample of 40. 000 farms to estimate price development of emission rights and their possible impact on the growth of the dairy production. The results show that a higher milk production leads to higher prices for emission rights. However, the increased cost of manure emission rights is not expected to impede dairy farm growth because the current milk quota rent estimates go far beyond the cost of manure emission rights. milk quota, manure emission rights, mathematical programming, Flanders, Agricultural and Food Policy, Industrial Organization, Research Methods/ Statistical Methods, C 02, C 61, L 11, Q 18,...|$|E

The diploma thesis {{is divided into}} three chapters. The first concentrates on the characteristics of basic terms such as exchange with its historic development and functions, commodity as the subject of exchange trades and <b>organised</b> commodity <b>market.</b> The second chapter describes briefly main types of exchange trades and principles of trading with the futures and options contracts on the future exchange. The third chapter {{is divided into three}} parts. The first deals with the legal aspects of commodity exchanges in the Czech republic including the outline of legislation existing in different periods of the czech history. Second concentrates on current commodity exchanges, its basic characteristics and trading mechanisms. The last represents the complex evaluation of {{the current state of the}} commodity exchange from the legal and economic point of view and the outline of its perspectives in following years.

Our results are recorded in a 300 page report which will be lodged with the Institute for Development Studies, the Ministry of Economic Planning and Development and the Ministry of Agriculture. However, we felt that many of the issues which we investigated were of sufficient interest to justify the production of a 'popular' but greatly condensed version of our findings in the hope that it will serve as a useful background for discussion purposes. For those who may not be aware of the institutional and structural aspects of the beef market in Kenya, this is a good opportunity to briefly describe them. In practice there are three markets which overlap {{to a greater or lesser}} degree:the urban market comprising Nairobi, Mombasa, Thika and Nakuru which is dominated by the Kenya Meat Commission (KMC), the other urban and more populous rural areas in which an <b>organised</b> <b>market</b> may be said to exist, and the rural subsistance sector where it does not.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} {{of trade and}} the efficiency and stability of markets depend on how such markets are <b>organised.</b> <b>Market</b> microstructure, which analyses this linkage, {{is an area of}} research that has grown extremely rapidly over the past years. However, progress has essentially been made with regard to financial markets. The few articles devoted to the money market are either descriptive (and most often applied to the case of the United States), or based on data whose frequency is insufficient to capture certain stylised facts. For central banks, it is essential to have a good understanding of the practices and the organisation of financial and money markets, in particular {{the way in which they}} respond to monetary policy impulses. From a financial stability perspective, an in-depth understanding of market practices makes it possible to identify new categories of risk, such as short-term risk. In June 2006, the Banque de France organised in partnership with the Center for Research in Economics and Staistics (CREST) and the Europlace Institute of Finance (EIF), a conference on the microstructure of markets, and notably that of money markets. This conference brought together researchers from central banks, French and foreign universities and renowned research centres. Robert Engle (New York University, Nobel prize 2003) and S. “Vish” Viswanathan (Duke University) presented two invited conferences, and Thierry Foucault (HEC Paris), Joël Hasbrouck (New York University) and Suresh Sundaresan (Columbia University and Federal Reserve Bank of New York) participated in the closing roundtable. The discussions spanned a wide variety of topics that have attracted much attention over recent years: risk measures, the quality of financial markets, the structure of financial and money markets, etc. ...|$|E
40|$|Freshwater {{fish farming}} is rapidly growing in Papua New Guinea (PNG), {{particularly}} in rural inland areas. It is widely promoted {{as a food}} security and income-generating tool to address pervasive malnutrition and support rural development. A number of government, non-government and donor stakeholders are involved in {{various aspects of the}} activity. A lack of understanding of the characteristics and current status of the sector has limited the development of strategic directions by the lead government agency responsible, the National Fisheries Authority (NFA). The last sectoral analysis was undertaken in 2003; however, developments since then have changed fish farming and very little is know about the interventions required to sustainably manage it. This study presents a mixed-method approach to characterise the sector and establish a basis for further strategic planning using the Eastern Highlands Province (EHP) as a case study. This study first established factors outside of the aquaculture sector that influenced its development by conducting a Political, Economic, Environmental, Social and Technical (PEEST) analysis. This involved an extensive review of published papers as well as other sources (government reports) due to very little publications on PNG. The next step was a Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats (SWOT) analysis. A representative sample of farmers was interviewed throughout the province to gather basic farming data as well as ascertain views on the SWOT factors. A stakeholder focus group workshop was then convened to elicit the views of government, non-government and donor partners involved in aquaculture within EHP. Finally key NFA staff members were interviewed to determine high-level views on the SWOT factors. Descriptive analysis of farming data was undertaken and cross-tabulation of SWOT responses conducted to describe the current status of the sector. The PEEST and SWOT outcomes were then synthesised to characterise aquaculture in EHP, and determine the issues and required interventions. The PEEST analysis showed that politically, aquaculture was captured in major government legislation and key development plans. NFA was identified as the key lead agency in the development of this sector. Widespread policy support fostered the involvement and development stakeholders. PNG’s recent economic growth has influenced the evolution of a subset of semi-commercial operators in the province. The availability of government credit and grants has also influenced interest in fish farming. The natural environment has been conducive to the establishment of aquaculture; however, increased competition for resources, climate change and eventual intensification are threats. Socially, the ability of fish farming to complement rural lifestyle has enhanced its uptake. Its contribution to improving dietary protein levels, and rural development, has further strengthened its role. Increasing population and law and order issues are threats that need to be managed. The introduction of Genetically Improved Farmed Tilapia (GIFT) and the development of local fish feed are important technical interventions that have changed aquaculture. However, the majority of farmers still lack critical skills, and the lack of technical capacity limits extension services by government. The study presented an analysis of farming data that reflected findings of the PEEST work. The farming data also highlighted the changes in the sector since the last major survey in 2003. This investigation revealed validated SWOT factors that characterised the sector. There were eight significant strengths: the availability of fingerlings; the local production of fish feed; the availability of local expertise; the recognition by government of aquaculture as a tool for rural development; the creation of provincial farmers cooperative; NFAs role as lead government organisation widely recognised; location of HAQDEC in the province; and farmers training courses are established and have been widely utilised. There were also eight weaknesses identified: firstly, farmers lack essential production and management skills; high fish feed cost and inconsistent supply; lack of <b>organised</b> <b>market</b> and associated infrastructure; lack of updated, relevant extension and awareness material along with standardisation of training; the lack of an updated strategic development plan was the most significant weakness; the widespread abuse and lack of monitoring and evaluation of NFA’s PDF grant; the lack of trained personnel to service increasing farmer levels; and finally, the lack of a local aquaculture equipment supplier. Five key opportunities were identified: farmers are receptive to interventions; farmers are willing to work with stakeholders and participate in rural development planning; the natural environment is conducive and predicted increased temperatures will improve fish growth; there is increased demand for aquaculture technology and products; and finally, there is increasing demand for fish feed. Seven significant threats to fish farming in EHP included: weak and deteriorating transport infrastructure and increased cost of living; increasing social (law and order) issues; administrative decisions, slow government process and political decisions negatively affecting programs; cross-border invasive species and farmers lack of awareness on environmental/disease risks; limited range of locally available feed ingredients; climate change and increased natural disasters; and the issue of land tenure which is of particular concern for commercial ventures. Finally, a synthesis of the PEEST and SWOT factors revealed the current status of the fish farming sector in EHP. Aquaculture was widely recognised and supported with {{the potential to be a}} major rural development tool. NFA leadership was critical to direct provincial development partners in key areas of extension and research. Findings from this work will enable decision makers in EHP to develop realistic development plans for the sector. This study will also assist NFA management to understand changes in the industry and presents a method that can be used in future sectoral analysis or planning processes. Recommendations presented will aid in the prioritisation of interventions from farmers through to provincial development stakeholders and NFA management levels...|$|E
