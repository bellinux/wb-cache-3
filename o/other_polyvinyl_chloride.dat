40|$|Conductive rubber {{anaesthetic}} circuit tubing both absorbs volatile {{agents and}} leaks these agents through its walls. We quantified the leakage and absorption {{properties of the}} most commonly used plastic materials used to make breathing circuit tubing, relative to conductive rubber. We then compared two different types of plastic tubes used to carry gas to volatile agent monitors; one made of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride,</b> the <b>other</b> made of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> lined internally with a thin layer of polyethylene. We found that the three commonly used plastic types used to make anaesthetic circuit tubing all leak less volatile anaesthetic through their walls than conductive rubber. Polyethylene and polypropylene tubing absorb significantly less volatile anaesthetic than conductive rubber; however, {{this is not the case}} with <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> tubing. Differences in the leakage and absorption properties of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> monitoring tubing are not significantly changed by the addition of a thin internal layer of polyethylene.

It is shown that the differences between the delay angles, Δφ = φTRI – φSIN, obtained using triangular and sinusoidal excitations on the composite samples, shows a maximum, {{and at the same time}} the position of this maximum shows more sensitivity to changes in the electrical properties of the material caused by ageing than other dielectric parameters.

30|$|Our {{attempt was}} {{to set up}} a {{membrane}} system of adequate chemical, thermal and mechanical stability. So, to acquire such membranes, the selection of binder is also of immense importance. Easily available polystyrene is found to be an appropriate binder as its cross-linked rigid framework provides adequate adhesion to the molecules of cobalt carbonate which accounts for the higher mechanical stability to the membrane over <b>other</b> binders like <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride,</b> cellulose acetate, etc. So, a polystyrene blended cobalt carbonate membrane results in more favourable thermal and mechanical stabilities provided by the inorganic part and furnishes good flexibility due to the organic component, i.e. polystyrene-supported cobalt carbonate nanocomposite membrane can be a potential and better candidate than many conventional membranes which degrade under harsh conditions frequently encountered in various industrial settings. Furthermore, it appears to be efficient and cost-effective material having solvent resistance and thermal resistance characteristics [15].|$|R

40|$|In {{structurally}} participating formworks, a new forming {{technique for}} reinforced concrete, {{referred to as}} stay-in-place formwork has recently emerged as a viable technique. This permanent new formwork system simplifies the construction process and reduces construction time. Two materials that are well-suited for this technique are fiber reinforced polymer and <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride.</b> This research presents a non-linear and three-dimensional finite element model for reinforced concrete walls with and without <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place formwork. There is a variety of commercial programs for three-dimensional finite element modelling, but they lack the ability to model a complex composite material such as reinforced concrete encased in a <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place forming system. For its high performance and extensive range of material modelling capabilities, the ABAQUS finite element package {{was used in the}} current study. Concrete was modelled using a concrete damage plasticity model, and steel bars were modelled using an elastic and perfectly plastic material. Perfect bond was assumed between concrete and steel. The <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place formwork was modelled using an elasto-plastic material. As with the concrete and steel, perfect bond was assumed between the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> panels and the concrete. Finite element results were validated using experimental results reported by Scott (2014). It was observed from the comparison that the proposed non-linear fine element model is capable of predicting the load capacity for the reinforced concrete walls with and without the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place formwork. Predicted yield loads were in good agreement with the experimental data, with an average error of 6 % for control walls, 7 % for the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> encased reinforced concrete walls with flat panels, and 3 % for the walls encased with hollow panels. In addition, finite element ultimate (peak) loads showed good correlation with the experimental data. The average error for the control, flat panel and hollow panel encased walls were 3 %, 3 % and 13 %, respectively. A parametric study was conducted to investigate the effect of concrete compressive strength, thickness of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> stay-in-place formwork, and the strength of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> used in stay-in-place formworks. It was observed that the concrete compressive strength has a significant effect on the flexural strength of <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> encased reinforced concrete walls. As expected, the thickness and strength of the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> used have a proportional effect on the behaviour of the encased reinforced concrete walls...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{paper will}} provide data {{to show that}} cyclic olefin {{copolymer}} blister film {{can be used as}} a beneficial alternative to <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> film which is more commonly used in the pharmaceutical market today. <b>Polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> continues to be a highly controversial packaging material due to potential environmental concerns. Cyclic olefin copolymer is shown to have properties which result in fewer environmental concerns and also can provide the added benefit of an improved barrier to moisture permeation when compared to <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> film. This paper documents a summary of the data on both sides of the <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride</b> environmental debate. It also documents cyclic olefin copolymer 2 ̆ 7 s mechanical properties, small and large scale manufacturing data, and potential future developments which will improve the manufacturing of many new film opportunities for cyclic olefin copolymer as well as reduce the manufacturing costs. To date, very little public information could be found documenting data on cyclic olefin copolymer for use as a replacement for <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride,</b> currently used for blister packaging. Most of the data available today has been provided by cyclic olefin copolymer manufacturers instead of industry and/or institutions. The null hypothesis for this thesis is as follows: Cyclic olefin copolymer will not be a beneficial alternative blister film to <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride.</b> It will not address environmental concerns, it will not be able to be formed on small scale equipment without significant modifications, and it will not provide an improved moisture barrier compared to <b>polyvinyl</b> <b>chloride...</b>|$|R
