In {{commutative}} algebra, a Weitzenböck derivation is a nonzero triangular linear derivation of the polynomial algebra K[x 1, [...] ., xm] {{in several}} variables over a field K of characteristic 0.

5|$|The Reuleaux {{triangle}} is {{the least}} symmetric curve <b>of</b> <b>constant</b> width according to two different measures of central asymmetry, the Kovner–Besicovitch measure (ratio of area to the largest centrally symmetric shape enclosed by the curve) and the Estermann measure (ratio of area to the smallest centrally symmetric shape enclosing the curve). For the Reuleaux triangle, the two centrally symmetric shapes that determine the measures of asymmetry are both hexagonal, although the inner one has curved sides. The Reuleaux triangle has diameters that split its area more unevenly than any other curve <b>of</b> <b>constant</b> width. That is, the maximum ratio of areas {{on either side of}} a diameter, another measure of asymmetry, is bigger for the Reuleaux triangle than for other curves <b>of</b> <b>constant</b> width.|$|E
5|$|The angles made by {{each pair}} of arcs {{at the corners of}} a Reuleaux {{triangle}} are all equal to 120°. This is the sharpest possible angle at any vertex of any curve <b>of</b> <b>constant</b> width. Additionally, among the curves <b>of</b> <b>constant</b> width, the Reuleaux triangle is the one with both the largest and the smallest inscribed equilateral triangles. The largest equilateral triangle inscribed in a Reuleaux triangle is the one connecting its three corners, and the smallest one is the one connecting the three midpoints of its sides. The subset of the Reuleaux triangle consisting of points belonging to three or more diameters is the interior of the larger of these two triangles; it has a larger area than the set of three-diameter points of any other curve <b>of</b> <b>constant</b> width.|$|E

As a noncommutative generalization {{one considers the}} algebra <b>of</b> <b>constants</b> <b>of</b> a locally nilpotent linear derivation of a d-generated relatively free algebra F(V) in a variety V of unitary associative algebras over K. It is known that the algebra <b>of</b> <b>constants</b> <b>of</b> F(V) is finitely generated {{if and only if}} V satisfies a polynomial identity which does not hold for the algebra of 2 x 2 upper triangular matrices. Hence the free metabelian associative algebra F(M) is a crucial object to study.
