5|$|International Speedway Corporation (ISC) is a {{corporation}} whose primary business is the {{ownership and management}} <b>of</b> <b>NASCAR</b> and IndyCar race tracks.

The company has played an important, though controversial, role in the modernization of the sport. It has worked with NASCAR to create new tracks and update older ones in an effort to improve the racing and the experience for spectators (though because both companies have several members of the France family in top positions, ISC's competitors have filed multiple lawsuits on antitrust grounds) and has constructed popular new tracks in regions previously thought uninterested in NASCAR.|$|E
