40|$|International audienceA {{sampling}} {{campaign was}} conducted {{in order to determine}} alkylphenol (AP) concentrations in stormwater as well as potential AP sources in suburban environments. An analytical procedure was developed to quantify APs in bulk atmospheric deposition, building runoff, road runoff and stormwater. Both nonylphenols and <b>octylphenols</b> could be quantified in each sample. Median stormwater concentrations amounted to: 470 ng/l for nonylphenols, and 36 ng/l for <b>octylphenols.</b> These concentrations are 3 times higher than those found in atmospheric deposition, thus proving that local human activity constitutes a significant source of contamination. The contributions of the various sources to stormwater have been assessed from mass balances at the catchment scale. 70 % of AP mass in stormwater originates from building and road emissions. Annual AP fluxes have been extrapolated from the total AP mass measured over our sampling periods for atmospheric depositions (44 to 84 µgNP/m(2) /yr) and stormwater (100 to 190 µgNP/m(2) /yr). Moreover, since APs were mainly found in the dissolved fraction, runoff treatment devices based on settling are unlikely to be very efficient...|$|E
40|$|Alkylphenols (APs) and AP {{ethoxylated}} compounds (APES) {{were screened}} in human subcutaneous adipose tissue samples from Italy. The {{samples were collected}} during bariatric surgery from 16 subjects (three men and 13 women) {{and a total of}} seven alkylphenol compounds (APs) was detected. Nonylphenol (NP) was the compound found at the highest level (mean 122 ng g(- 1) fresh weight; range 10 - 266 ng g(- 1) fw). Several nonylphenol ethoxylates (NPEOs) were found in all the sample analysed though the frequency of detection decreased with the increasing number of ethoxylic groups. NP 4 EO was found only in four patients ranging from trace amounts to 41. 3 ng g(- 1), fw. Total nonylphenols (NPEs) ranged between 45 and 1131 ng g(- 1) fw, whereas the concentration of total <b>octylphenols</b> (OPEs) was at least 10 times lower (range 6 - 80 ng g(- 1) fw). Our findings show that the average concentration of NP is about two times higher than that found in women from Southern Spain and up to three times that of people from Switzerland. Similarly, OP mean level is two times that reported in Finland and Spain populations. This is the first study that reports the presence of alkylphenols in the Italian population adipose tissue and it draws a baseline for further researches in order to depict a trend in human exposure to these compounds and to investigate possible consequences for human health.

40|$|International audienceParis {{conurbation}} is {{a heavily}} urbanized but weakly industrialized catchment. Recently, {{it has been}} shown at the scale of Paris that alkylphenols (AP) and phthalates (PAE) are not rejected by the industry, but they originate from domestic wastewater at more than 95 %. However, the contribution of the different types of greywater to the pollution by alkylphenols and phthalates was not addressed. This work aims at providing new insights on this particular point. Hence, the concentration of four phthalates (diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DnBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), and di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP)) and two alkylphenols (<b>octylphenols</b> (OP) and isomers of nonylphenol (NP)) were followed in greywater. For each sample, analyses were carried out on both the dissolved and particulate phases. Moreover, water quality parameters were also monitored, in order to find out whether or not any correlation exists between the concentration of the investigated contaminants and the quality of water. Water quality parameters studied are pH, total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved and particular organic carbon (DOC and POC), chemical and biochemical oxygen demands (COD and BOD 5), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and anionic detergents (methylene blue active substance or MBAS). This paper presents the methodology used to monitor two greywater with the most important volumes: showers and washing machines. These greywater showed high variability with regard to water quality parameters. Moreover, AP and PAE concentrations are given for the first time for these two types of greywater. All compounds except OP were observed in almost all samples in {{at least one of the}} two monitored phases. The concentrations varied between limit of quantification for OP and 102 μg/l for DEHP. The levels measured in washing machines were higher than those for showers for all compounds. For instance, median NP concentration in washing machines was 3. 59 μg/l against 1. 09 μg/l in showers, DEHP was observed at 102 μg/l in washing machines against 16. 6 μg/l in showers. Variability of the results was explained by habits of individuals (shower time, number of products used…) but also by differences in product composition. However, each type of water exhibited the same distribution. NP was the most abundant AP (about 85 % of the total amount) while DEHP represented the two thirds of the PAE compounds. The partition coefficients (Kd in l/kg) were evaluated. The results showed that log Kd ranged between 2. 1 (DEP) and 4. 8 (DEHP). Log Koc presented similar trends lying in the 2. 4 (DEP) - 5. 0 (DEHP) range. Finally, with regard to greywater quality, the application for greywater reuse is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Degradation of {{branched}} <b>octylphenol</b> was {{studied in}} a bacterial culture of a Sphingomonas sp. strain. <b>Octylphenol</b> {{is considered to}} be the most stable degradation intermediate formed from the corresponding nonionic <b>octylphenol</b> polyethoxylates surfactants during biological wastewater treatment. Since <b>octylphenol</b> can exert estrogenic effects in wildlife, a detailed study of its biodegradation is warranted. The aerobic microbiological transformation of <b>octylphenol</b> was examined with and without the addition of the easily assimilable sodium acetate. In both cases the formation of the metabolite 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 2 -pentanol, representing the intact alkyl chain as a tertiary alcohol, was observed. Since the <b>octylphenol</b> degradation rate was not affected by the presence of acetate, this strain did not show any diauxic metabolic behaviour when incubated with <b>octylphenol</b> and sodium acetate as the sources of carbon and energy. As a result of the biotransformation of <b>octylphenol,</b> its estrogenic potency was removed because it is the phenolic moiety that interacts with the estrogen receptors.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 61 - 76). Los Laureles - Goat Canyon is a subwatershed {{located within}} the Tijuana River Watershed is presented. This canyon measures 1191 hectares (4. 6 square miles), of which 90 percent is in Mexico, and the remainder {{is part of the}} Tijuana River National Estuary Research Reserve(TRNERR) in the U. S. In this canyon, as in most of the Mexican border region, the rapid human population growth has led to an unorganized urbanization established with squatter housing structures that lack potable water, sewage system, paved roads, and appropriate waste management. As a consequence, several opened solid waste dumpsites have been observed in the Mexican side of the canyon. These open dumpsites along with the lack of other public services are considered to contribute environmental contaminants that may affect human health and wildlife in the TRNERR. The objectives of this study were to (i) determine the presence and concentration of heavy metals in soil samples collected from Los Laureles/Goat Canyon, (ii) examine soil samples from Los Laureles/Goat Canyon using a non-targeted analysis to screen for the presence of organic pollutants including POPs, (iii) identify the possible sources of the soil contaminants in the canyon, (iv) obtain baseline data for future comparison with studies conducted on other contaminated soils, and (v) create a baseline data of the soil contaminants on the canyon that can be utilized in future research. This study utilized the X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry to screen for heavy metals in 24 composite soil samples. A comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC??GC/ToF-MS) was used to screen for the presence of organic contaminants using a non-targeted analysis 9 composite soil samples. As results, 16 metals were detected, but only arsenic and cadmium were found to be above the EPA recommended levels (apply for cleaned Superfund sites). The soil concentrations of Cd found in this study are similar to previous studies done on the TRNERR, indicating. that the metal concentrations in this area havenot changed since the year 1997. With respect to the organic pollutants, this study identified 168 organic compounds, but there was only some scientific literature information for the only 30 compounds. Some organic contaminants such as benzothiazole (BT) and its derivative compounds seem to originate from rubber materials of the tires disposed at this canyon. Few pesticide related compounds such as hydroxylated biphenyl and benzyl benzoate were also found. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), compound known by the state of California to have carcinogenic characteristics, and several phenolic compounds used as antioxidants were also detected in the screened soil samples. In addition, organic compounds that have may have endocrine disruptor characteristics such as <b>octylphenols,</b> galaxolide, musk ketone, bisphenol A (BPA), and triclosan (TCS), which are commonly used in household products were also detected in this study. Nonetheless, the origin of the majority of these compounds is unknown because they can come {{from a wide range of}} sources. For example, the several alkylated benzenes and PAHs found in this study might come from combustion or various forms of fuel. Only the parent PAHs, alkylated/partially saturated PAHs (semi-quantified), BPA, and TCS were quantified for this study. The PAHs concentrations were similar or lower than background concentrations around the world's soil, but the average concentration levels of BPA (209 ppb) and TCS (280 ppb) found in this canyon are noteworthy because they are higher or comparable to concentrations found in sewage sludge and soils amended with sewage sludge. This suggests that these contaminants may come from sewage due to the fact that the residents in this canyon lack a sewage system or a water treatment plant. Therefore, the concentration and verification of some of the organic compounds needs to be done, and further research measuring the concentrations and ecological effects of BPA, TCS, and other compounds related to municipal sewage in this canyon should be conducted...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a relative binding affinity-serum modified access (RBA-SMA) assay {{to determine the effect}} of serum on the access of xenoestrogens to estrogen receptors within intact cultured MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells. We used this assay to predict low dose activity of two xenoestrogens in mice. In serum-free medium, bisphenol A, a component of polycarbonates and of resins used to line metal food cans, showed a lower relative binding affinity (RBA; 0. 006 %) than <b>octylphenol</b> (0. 072 %) and nonylphenol (0. 026 %), which are used as surfactants in many commercial products (all RBAs are relative to estradiol, which is equal to 100 %). In 100 % serum from adult men, bisphenol A showed a higher RBA (0. 01 %) than in serum-free medium and thus enhanced access to estrogen receptors relative to estradiol. In contrast, <b>octylphenol</b> showed a 22 -fold decrease in RBA (0. 0029 %) and nonylphenol showed a 5 -fold decrease in RBA (0. 0039 %) when measured in adult serum. This indicates that, relative to estradiol, serum had less of an inhibitory effect on the cell uptake and binding in MCF- 7 cells of bisphenol A, while serum had a greater inhibitory effect on <b>octylphenol</b> and nonylphenol relative to estradiol. Extrapolation of these relative activities in adult serum predicted that the estrogenic bioactivity of bisphenol A would be over 500 -fold greater than that of <b>octylphenol</b> in fetal mouse serum. Bisphenol A and <b>octylphenol</b> were fed to pregnant mice at 2 and 20 micrograms/kg/day. Exposure of male mouse fetuses to either dose of bisphenol A, but to neither dose of <b>octylphenol,</b> significantly increased their adult prostate weight relative to control males, which is consistent with the higher predicted bioactivity of bisphenol A than <b>octylphenol</b> in the RBA-SMA assay.

Collectively referred to as micropollutants, they include paraben preservatives, organic UV filters, alkylphenols, triclosan, and bisphenol-A. Micropollutants enter the aquatic environment predominantly via wastewater discharges. To date there has been only limited assessments on their presence and impacts in coastal environments. The wastewater treatment plants in Lyttelton, Governors Bay, and Diamond Harbour were found to discharge micropollutants into Whakaraupo Harbour. Similarly, the sewage effluents of the Antarctic research stations Scott Base and McMurdo Station were found to discharge micropollutants into Erebus Bay. Strong seasonal changes in the Whakaraupo effluent concentrations were observed, with concentrations higher in winter than in summer. Concentrations fluctuated greatly in Scott Base, reaching concentrations higher than have been previously reported internationally. The nine most commonly detected analytes were <b>octylphenol,</b> 4 -MBC, BP- 3, BP- 1, triclosan, methyl triclosan, bisphenol-A, estrone, and coprostanol.

In recent ecotoxicological research, there is an increasing concern over the emerging endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the environment due to its multiple effects especially on health and reproduction of wildlife and humans.

For instance, MP have been shown to contain the WFD priority substances di(ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), nonylphenol, <b>octylphenol,</b> and PAHs (2008 / 105 /EC, Annex II).|$|R
3000|$|Other {{chemicals}} {{of concern}} include plastic additives with known or suspected endocrine disrupting properties, including alkylphenols (<b>octylphenol</b> and nonylphenol) used mainly as antioxidants, bisphenol A (BPA) present in polycarbonate plastics as trace monomer, phthalate esters [e.g. di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), diisodecyl phthalate (DIDP), diisononyl phthalate (DINP) and {{butyl benzyl phthalate}} (BPP)], widely used as plasticizers in proportions up to 60 % {{of the weight of}} a plastic to increase properties such as flexibility, transparency or longevity, and organotin compounds (based on methyl, butyl or octyl groups, such as tributyltin 19) used as stabilizing additives in some PVC polymers. For example, Takada et al. [57] and Hirai et al. [58] analysed a wide range of chemicals in marine plastics collected from urban and remote beaches and open oceans, including theoretically “non-persistent” additives such as alkylphenols, i.e. nonylphenol, <b>octylphenol,</b> and BPA, which were detected in concentrations ranging from ng/g to μg/g in polyethylene and polypropylene debris. 20 Moreover, a significant correlation has been demonstrated [18, 60] among seven different phthalate esters (phthalates or PAEs) present in samples taken in the same area of microplastics, plankton and bubbler samples of different cetacean species. 21 [...]...|$|R
40|$|Pregnant {{females of}} the eelpout Zoarces viviparus {{were exposed to}} {{different}} environmental factors to investigate the impact on metabolites which may elucidate physiological interrelations between the embryos and the pregnant mothe fish. The maternal organism was exposed to different salinities, elevated levels of nitrogenous endproducts and to different concentrations of the xenobiotic compound <b>octylphenol,</b> respectively. The concentrations of ammonia, urea, low molecular compounds, chloride, and calcium were measured in the maternal plasma and the ovarian fluid, the ambient medium of the embryos. Ammonia increased in the maternal plasma {{as well as in}} the ovarian fluid by the highest salinity (28 ppt). No change could be observed in the level of urea or chloride by increased salinities. By exposing the embryos to increased levels of urea and ammonia in their ambient medium, the ovarian fluid, it was observed that a steady flow of the nitrogenous compounds occurred from the ovarian fluid to the maternal plasma. In the fish exposed to <b>octylphenol</b> the calcium concentration in the ovarian fluid decreased in a dose-dependent manner by increasing concentrations of the estrogenic compounds. In contrast significant increased levels of total calcium were observed in the plasma of the exposed motherfish...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile {{rainbow trout}} were given {{intraperitoneal}} (IP) injections of (i) <b>octylphenol</b> (OP) and butylbenzylphthalate (BBP) or (ii) <b>octylphenol</b> and estradiol (E). Both pairs of compounds were administered singly and in combination, at two different dose levels. Modulation of the hepatic estradiol receptor (ER) binding capacity and induction of hepatic zona radiata proteins (Zrp) were utilised {{as indicators of}} estrogenic effect. In treatment (i) OP caused a significant (approx 2 -fold) upregulation of the ER and a significant (approx 3 - 5 fold) increase in Zrp at both doses compared to control, vehicle-injected fish. In contrast, {{no effect on the}} ER was observed in BBP-treated fish, but plasma Zrp levels were significantly reduced. No synergistic effect was observed on ER modulation or Zrp induction in fish receiving OP and BBP in combination. In treatment (ii) both OP and E caused a significant (approx 2 -fold) upregulation of the ER and a significant (approx 6 - 7 fold) increase in plasma Zrp at both dose levels compared to controls. The effect of OP and E in combination, on both ER modulation and induction of Zrp, was additive and not synergistic...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the study of removal of nonylphenol, <b>octylphenol</b> and their ethoxylates from real {{industrial}} and municipal wastewater are presented. Industrial wastewater was pre-treated by coagulation with FeCl 3 and adsorption on zeolite, before discharging into municipal sewer system. Their removal efficiencies in primary sedimentation tank of municipal WWTP were very low. From the practical point of view, the highest and the most significant removal efficiencies within the whole WWTP were observed for nonylphenol and nonylphenol ethoxylates. Dominancy of abiotic mechanisms of alkylphenols removal follows from adsorption measurements. Activated sludge cultivated in lab-scale extended aeration tank accounted for relatively high adsorption affinity to these substances. Activated sludge sampled from municipal wastewater treatment plant (MWWTP) receiving industrial wastewater containing alkylphenols accounted for very low adsorption affinity to these pollutants. Significantly higher removal efficiency of <b>octylphenol</b> ethoxylates was observed with the O 3 /granular active carbon (GAC) process compared to the ozonation process alone. Lower toxicity impact of intermediates and products of ozonation treatment on Vibrio fischeri was measured in comparison to the O 3 /GAC process. Actually, the municipal WWTP effluent discharge concentration values complies with EQS values, including nonylphenols.

40|$|The {{adsorption}} isotherms for the <b>octylphenol</b> ethoxylate, TX 100, onto {{a range of}} bentonites and a saponite have been determined and the resulting thermal stability of composites has been studied. In general TX 100 exhibited a high affinity for the different clay surfaces although the maximum amount adsorbed varied with both clay type, layer charge density and resident exchange cation. XRD and variable temperature XRD showed that TX 100 was adsorbed into the interlamellar region, and that the thermal stability of the clay/TX 100 composite was dependent upon the exchangeable cation present. For monovalent cation exchanged clays (M+-clay/TX 100) the TX 100 decomposed between 220 and 300 degrees C, and the d(001) spacing decreased from 15. 2 to 9. 6 Angstrom. In contrast, divalent cation exchanged clays imparted a greater thermal stability to the complex (M 2 +-clay/TX 100) owing to coordination of adsorbed TX 100 to the exchange cation, wherein weakly coordinated TX 100 was stable to 270 degrees C and strongly coordinated TX 100 was held to temperatures in excess of 300 degrees C. FTIR analysis of the gases evolved evolved during thermogravimetry confirmed that the <b>octylphenol</b> unit was desorbed from M 2 +-clay at temperatures below 400 degrees C and that portions of the ethoxylate chain were held to 500 degrees C...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} method {{based on the}} application of fluorescence spectrophotometry is developed for the determination of <b>Octylphenol</b> (OP) in food packaging materials. The extraction of OP from plastic food packaging materials was carried out using microwave-assisted solvent extraction. Laboratory experiments have shown that when the concentrations of OP are from 0. 1 to 0. 6 mg. L- 1, they have a linear relationship with the emitted fluorescence intensity. In this interval, the calibration curve is y= 10 + 212 x, showing strong correlation (correlation coefficientR 2 is 0. 9983) ...|$|R
