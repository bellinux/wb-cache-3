25|$|The surface-to-volume-ratio in {{the moving}} {{combustion}} chamber is so complex that a direct comparison cannot {{be made between}} a reciprocating piston engine and a Wankel engine. The flow velocity and the heat losses are quite different. Surface temperature characteristics are completely different; the film {{of oil in the}} Wankel engine acts as insulation. Engines with a higher compression ratio have a worse surface-to-volume ratio. The surface-to-volume ratio of a reciprocating piston diesel engine is much poorer than a reciprocating piston gasoline engine, but diesel engines have a higher efficiency factor. Hence, comparing power outputs is a realistic metric. A reciprocating piston engine with equal power to a Wankel will be approximately twice the displacement. When comparing the power-to-weight ratio, physical size or physical weight to a similar power <b>output</b> <b>piston</b> engine, the Wankel is superior.|$|E

This company expanded greatly in the 1920s and 30s, with factories spread across Germany. Jumo was the first company to produce a successful aircraft diesel engine in material numbers, the opposed-piston layout two stroke Jumo 205, {{and it was the}} first German company to offer a truly modern engine suitable for aviation in the form of the 650 hp, inverted-V12 Jumo 210. But, with the rapid advances in airframes, after a few years this engine was considered to be underpowered, causing Jumo to respond with the much larger Jumo 211, the most-produced German aviation engine of any type during the war years. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the 211 saw widespread use in Junkers bombers — most often in a [...] "unitized" [...] form for the Junkers Ju 88A, and also in the competing Heinkel He 111H medium bomber — but was little used otherwise, due largely to the better power output of the competing Daimler-Benz DB 601. Further development of the 211 led to the superb Jumo 213, which was in high demand for an increasingly large variety of late-war piston-engined aircraft. Their only attempt at an over-1,500 kW <b>output</b> <b>piston</b> engine, the Junkers Jumo 222, suffered from inadequate metallurgy and internal design for what was otherwise a very innovative engine design, with nearly 300 examples produced solely as test examples — the aviation engine firms of the Third Reich had considerable challenges in developing piston engines that could exceed the 1,500 kW output level that would be able to operate with proven combat reliability. However, the world's first production axial-flow compressor-equipped turbojet engine, emerged from the [...] "Jumo" [...] firm in 1944 as the Jumo 004, becoming the first turbojet engine to be considered of production quality, and was used in the then revolutionary Messerschmitt Me 262A jet fighter.|$|E
40|$|Recently, with {{development}} in the output power and material cost efficiency, the value of thermal and mechanical stress on many engine parts such as piston is increased. On the other hands, the strength of aluminum alloys used for piston manufacturing decreases with temperature. So, for lightweight pistons, the strength reduction should be minimized to maintain the mechanical integrity of the part. This drives piston designers to use strong and lightweight materials that can sustain a harsh thermal environment through improved oil cooling. In addition to modify the power <b>output,</b> <b>piston</b> cooling reduces the carbonization and pre-ignition caused by hot spots on sharp edges of the piston crown. In this study, in order to evaluate the piston cooling functionality and validate the numerical simulation, a test rig is designed and manufactured and it is equipped with glassy piston and cylinder to show the oil contact surface. Using this test rig, flow rate is measured in different oil pressures and temperatures. In addition, heat transfer coefficient for various engine speeds is determined. Also a numerical model has been developed using CFD approach for analysis of piston cooling oil jet and validated with existing experimental results at axisymmetric condition. Finally, oil contact area and heat transfer coefficient are predicted {{at the bottom of}} piston for real piston cooling jet conditions...|$|E

Valve timing {{is critical to}} the performance of hydraulic piston motors and pumps. With non-optimal valve timing, the pressure differential across the valve during a valve opening or closing can be significant, causing transitional throttling loss and reducing the energy efficiency. The goal of this thesis is to provide a fundamental understanding of the role of valve timing and propose a viable active valve solution for better efficiency of hydraulic pumps and motors. Previously, researchers have proposed a variety of valve timing models based on analytical modeling, numerical simulation, and optimization. However, many critical questions, such as the relationship between the valve timing and throttling energy loss, the meaning of the valve timing optimality, and the influence of the fluid compressibility with entrained gas, have not been fully answered. Prior work on valves with active timing have focused on reducing the valve transition time, leakage, and dead volume. The cylindrical rotary valve architecture {{has been found to be}} a promising solution, provided that the leakage issue is solved. In this research, a new two-phase analytical valve timing solution, a complete active motor-valve numerical model, a prototype cylindrical rotary valve, and a novel fluid compressibility experiment have been developed. Results have shown that the analytical valve timing solution is capable of capturing the trade-offs between throttling energy loss and <b>output</b> <b>piston</b> work. A full model of a motor was used to optimize valve timing for a specific operating condition. The numerical model was validated experimentally, where a prototype active rotary valve was integrated into a commercial pump. A rectified bulk modulus model was derived from a novel mass transfer experiment to determine the compressibility of oil with entrained gas based on an optical bubble size measurement. The contributions of the thesis are: (1) the validated analytical and numerical models that allow finding the optimal valve timing as a function of the operating conditions, (2) a new active valve architecture that enables variable valve timing motor/pump, and (3) a rectified fluid compressibility model based on a lumped interfacial mass transport equation that predicts the effective fluid bulk modulus dynamically...|$|E
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. July 2015. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: James Van de Ven. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxii, 255 pages. Hydraulic power systems offer a robust, compact, and flexible method of power transmission {{and are used}} widely in both industrial and mobile applications. While 2 % of the energy consumed in the US passes through hydraulic systems, {{less than half of}} it does any useful work largely due to the use of inefficient flow control valves. Variable displacement pumps offer a method of delivering the required flow to an actuator without suffering the losses associated with a flow control valve. However, current variable displacement pumps exhibit poor efficiency at low displacement because their primary sources of energy loss are largely independent of displacement. Here, a novel adjustable linkage is proposed as the driving mechanism of a variable displacement pump. The linkage is constructed such that the pumping piston returns to the same top-dead-center position at all displacement, and can also achieve zero displacement. As a result of these features, the pump displacement is infinitely variable, and the unswept volume is remains constant at all displacements. By using pinned joints rather than sliding joints, the majority of the energy losses scale with output power resulting in a pump that is efficient over a wide range of operating conditions. In this thesis, a complete model of a variable displacement linkage pump is developed. A method of constructing the adjustable sixbar mechanism and the possible embodiments is presented. A new solution rectification technique is developed providing a robust method of generating valid linkages that is generally applicable to other mechanisms. The kinematics of the mechanism are then presented to describe the motion of the links and <b>output</b> <b>piston.</b> A kinetostatic model of the mechanism provides a means of determining the internal mechanical energy losses. A non-linear model of the bearing friction augments the model, but requires numerical methods to solve, and increases computational complexity. A dynamic model of the pumping cylinders and pump manifold provide a means of determining the fluid behavior of the pump including output flowrates and pressures. These models are coupled to create a complete understanding of the variable displacement linkage pump. The model is designed to be predictive and computationally inexpensive for use in multi-objective optimizations. As such, no experimentally determined performance coefficients are required. No model of this level of completeness exist for linkage driven pumps, variable displacement or otherwise. Two prototype pumps are presented and used to validate the models. A single cylinder pump is used to validate the mechanical energy loss model but was limited to low pressure operation due to large torque variations. Close agreement is demonstrated between the model and experiment. The model predicts a pump efficiency greater than 90 % at displacements as low as 15 % if roller bearings are used in the pin joints. To validate this prediction, a multi-cylinder prototype which uses roller bearings in the joints is designed. The kinematic and mechanical energy loss models are coupled to a basic pumping model for use in a multi-objective genetic algorithm to optimize the mechanism. The resulting pump demonstrates close agreement between the model and experimentally measured shaft torque and mechanical energy loss at various pressures, displacements, and input shaft speeds. However, out-of-plane deflection of the mechanism reduced the piston displacement and altered the trajectory reducing pump output. The true temporal piston position is measured and used as an input to the dynamic fluid model. The predicted and experimentally measured cylinder pressures demonstrate the effectiveness of the model at predicting the dynamic behavior of the fluid end of the pump. It is shown that the models can accurately capture the physics of the pump without using tuning parameters or experimentally determined coefficients over a wide range of operating conditions. It is recommended that single shear linkage arrangements are avoided in future designs to increase the mechanism stiffness and improve performance. The variable displacement linkage pump offers the opportunity for high efficiency flow control at a wide range of operating conditions {{due to the nature of}} the energy loss mechanisms scaling with the output power. The flexibility of the driving sixbar mechanism allows for the optimization of the architecture for particular applications and the presented model provides a means of predicting performance...|$|E
