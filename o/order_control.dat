2500|$|Control is a 2007 British biographical {{film about}} the life of Ian Curtis, singer of the late-1970s English post-punk band Joy Division. It is the first feature film {{directed}} by Anton Corbijn, who had worked with Joy Division as a photographer. The screenplay by Matt Greenhalgh was based on the biography Touching from a Distance by Curtis's widow Deborah, who served as a co-producer on the film. Tony Wilson, who released Joy Division's records through his Factory Records label, also served as a co-producer. Curtis' bandmates Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Stephen Morris provided incidental music for the soundtrack via their post-Joy Division incarnation New <b>Order.</b> <b>Control</b> was filmed partly on location in Nottingham, Manchester, and Macclesfield, including areas where Curtis lived, and was shot in colour and then printed to black-and-white. Its title comes from the Joy Division song [...] "She's Lost Control", and the fact that much of the plot deals with the notion that Curtis tried to remain ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are several}} factors {{that control the}} depth of trenches. [...] The most {{important}} control is the supply of sediment, which fills the trench {{so that there is}} no bathymetric expression. It is therefore not surprising that the deepest trenches (deeper than [...] ) are all nonaccretionary. [...] In contrast, all trenches with growing accretionary prisms are shallower than [...] A second <b>order</b> <b>control</b> on trench depth is the age of the lithosphere at the time of subduction. Because oceanic lithosphere cools and thickens as it ages, it subsides. The older the seafloor, the deeper it lies, and this determines the minimum depth from which the seafloor begins to descend. [...] This obvious correlation can be removed by looking at the relative depth, the difference between regional seafloor depth and maximum trench depth. Relative depth may be controlled by the age of the lithosphere at the trench, the convergence rate, and the dip of the subducted slab at intermediate depths. Finally, narrow slabs can sink and roll back more rapidly than broad plates, because it is easier for underlying asthenosphere to flow {{around the edges of the}} sinking plate. [...] Such slabs may have steep dips at relatively shallow depths and so may be associated with unusually deep trenches, such as the Challenger Deep.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the first}} <b>order</b> <b>controls</b> over {{resource}} cycling and limitation in ecosystems {{is critical for}} predicting ecosystem response to disturbances. Topography and vegetation self-organizing mechanisms are first <b>order</b> <b>controls</b> over resource fluxes across the landscape. Topography controls downslope flow of resources (i. e water and nutrients). Through spatial feedbacks, vegetation is able to actively modify its environment and maximize resource flows towards it. To date, the impacts of these controls on ecosystem dynamics have mostly been investigated separately. As such, there is a knowledge gap {{in the understanding of}} how these first <b>order</b> <b>controls</b> together dictate the dynamics of the ecosystem. This dissertation aims {{to gain a better understanding}} of how self-organizing mechanisms and topography operate together to affect wetland ecosystem dynamics. A spatially explicit, wetland vegetation patterning model that includes for both vegetation self-organizing control and topographic control is developed (Nutrient Depletion Model, NDM). The model describes a scale dependent feedback between vegetation, transpiration and nutrient accumulation that drives the formation of vegetation patterns. The model is applied to investigate the effects of topography and self-organizing mechanisms on form and orientation of vegetation patterns and vegetation growth dynamics of wetland ecosystems. Results show that the two first <b>order</b> <b>controls</b> synergistically impact the formation of the various patterns as observed in wetland ecosystems. Results also show the following: (1) Self-organizing mechanisms result in a more efficient retention of resources, which result in higher biomass in the model that include for both self-organizing mechanism and topographic control (SO+TC) than in the model that that includes only for topographic control (TC). (2) However, when resources or topographic gradients increase or annual rainfall decrease, the vegetation growth dynamics of the TC+SO and TC models converge. The NDM is applied to arctic Alaska to investigate how do the two first <b>order</b> <b>controls</b> impact present and future C-N dynamics of an arctic ecosystem. Simulation results show no significant difference in the dynamics between the SO+TC model and the TC model. The climate change simulation results suggest that changes in daily variability of temperature and precipitation can impact ecosystem dynamics as much as the changes in mean temperature and precipitation. Results from this dissertation provide a more complete picture on the relative roles of the two first <b>order</b> <b>controls</b> over ecosystem nutrient cycling and vegetative growth dynamics. Finally, in this thesis, in order to simulate small-scale feedbacks over large spatial domains, the NDM is implemented in a GPU computing language, which accelerates computational simulation by at least two orders of magnitude. These tools for grid-based simulations can provide a platform for using GPUs in other areas of scientific investigation.
