50|$|Proper feeding {{management}} of wild animals in zoos and aquariums incorporates both husbandry skills and applied nutritional sciences. As a basic foundation of animal management, nutrition {{is integral to}} longevity, disease prevention, growth and reproduction. Additionally food collecting and/or gathering contributes to behavioral enrichment and provides occupation. Quite elaborate systems of food presentation (dead rats) have been developed (e.g. in Switzerland for wild cats), where computer programmed various mechanic devices allow the animals in the enclosure to search for prey as in their natural environment. However, in some cases animals in zoos need to be fed with <b>other</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals,</b> because they would not eat non-living food items. Whenever {{this has to be}} done however, the prey should have, as in natural conditions, a possibility to hide and it must be assured that the prey animal is killed as quickly as possible without pain and suffering. Whenever the animals accept dead prey or food items, they are not to be given live animals as food.|$|E
50|$|Live prey is {{sometimes}} {{attacked by the}} bearded vulture, with perhaps greater regularity than any other vulture. Among these, tortoises seem to be especially favored depending on their local abundance. Tortoises preyed on may be nearly as heavy as the preying vulture. When killing tortoise, bearded vultures also fly to some height and drop them to crack open the bulky reptiles' hard shells. Golden eagles have been observed to kill tortoises in the same way. <b>Other</b> <b>live</b> <b>animals,</b> up to nearly their own size, have been observed to be predaciously seized and dropped in flight. Among these are rock hyraxes, hares, marmots and, in one case, a 62 cm long monitor lizard. Larger animals {{have been known to}} be attacked by bearded vultures, including ibex, Capra goats, Chamois and Steenbok. These animals have been killed by being surprised by the large birds and battered with wings until they fall off precipitous rocky edges to their deaths; although in some cases these may be accidental killings when both the vulture and the mammal surprise each other. Many large animals killed by bearded vultures are unsteady young, or have appeared sickly or obviously injured. Humans have been anecdotally reported to {{have been killed in the}} same way. However, this is unconfirmed and, if it does happen, most biologists who have studied the birds generally agreed it would be accidental on the part of the vulture. Occasionally smaller ground-dwelling birds, such as partridges and pigeons, have been reported eaten, possibly either as fresh carrion (which is usually ignored by these birds) or killed with beating wings by the vulture. While foraging for bones or live prey while in flight, bearded vultures fly fairly low over the rocky ground, staying around 2 to 4 m high. Occasionally, breeding pairs may forage and hunt together. In the Ethiopian Highlands, bearded vultures have adapted to living largely off human refuse.|$|E

A possible whistle, or part of a set of pipes that were found, evokes images of social occasions and entertainment at the site.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determining}} the relationship between 365 -d yearling scrotal circumference, scanning weight, and component ultrasound measured compositional traits. The genetic correlations between scrotal circumference measured at 365 -d of age and <b>other</b> <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> measures are low. Of these five genetic relationships, the highest correlation is with % intramuscular fat (IMF) at. 13. However, this is a low genetic correlation. The positive sign of the scrotal circumference-% IMF genetic correlation is encouraging for breeders wanting to increase scrotal circumference and % IMF at the same time. Scrotal circumference in yearling Angus bulls is not strongly linked genetically with weight and compositional traits. Selection programs for either increased retail product (as measured by weight and ribeye area) or quality (as measured by % IMF) will not result in an antagonistic effect on scrotal circumference...|$|R

40|$|Five hundred thirty-four steers {{representing}} 6 sire breed {{groups were}} evaluated in 1994 (n = 282) and 1995 (n = 252) {{to determine the}} efficacy of using real-time ultrasound and <b>other</b> <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> measures to predict beef carcass composition. Within 5 days prior to slaughter, steers were ultrasonically measured for 12 - 13 th rib fat (UFAT), longissimus muscle area (UREA), rump fat thickness (URPFAT), and body wall thickness (UBDWALL). Carcasses were fabricated to determine boneless, totally trimmed retail product weight (KGRPRD) and percentage (PRPRD). Correlation coefficients between UFAT and UREA with carcass 12 - 13 th rib fat (CFAT) and carcass longissimus muscle area (CREA) were. 89 and. 86, respectively. Mean differences indicated UFAT was. 06 cm less (P 3 ̆c. 01) than CFAT, and UREA was. 71 cm 2 greater (P 3 ̆c. 01) than CREA across both years. Carcass measurements were more accurately evaluated with ultrasound in 1994 than in 1995 (P 3 ̆c. 01). Regression equations to predict KGRPRD and PRPRD were developed using either <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> or carcass traits as independent variables. Final models (P 3 ̆c. 10) using <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> ultrasound variables included live weight (FWT), UFAT, UREA, and URPFAT for KGRPRD (R 2 =. 84) and UFAT, URPFAT, UREA, UBDWALL, and FWT for PRPRD (R 2 =. 61). Comparatively, equations using carcass yield grade variables resulted in R 2 values of. 86 and. 65 for KGRPRD and PRPRD, respectively. When equations developed from 1994 steers were applied to steers in 1995, correlations between values predicted from <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> models and actual carcass values were. 92 for KGRPRD, and ranged from. 73 to. 76 for PRPRD. Similar correlations were found for equations developed from carcass measurements (r =. 94 for KGRPRD and. 80 to. 81 for PRPRD). Both <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> and carcass equations overestimated (P 3 ̆c. 01) actual KGRPRD and PRPRD. Regression of predicted values on actual values revealed a similar fit for <b>live</b> <b>animal</b> and carcass equations.

50|$|Banquets were {{important}} social events, usually hosted in private residences {{for friends and}} clients. The Romans placed great focus on the appearance of their dining room (triclinium), decorating it with murals and mosaics, as well as lavish sculptures and furniture. The overall purpose of a private banquet was entertainment, not only through live performances, but also through {{the presentation of the}} food itself. The meal consisted of three courses- appetizers, main course, and dessert- brought out in elaborate rituals. For instance, the main course was sometimes served to the tune of trumpets at particularly luxurious events. Foods that were particularly valued were wild game, such as pheasant and boar, certain kinds of fish, and wild berries, mainly because of their exoticism and high price. Some ancient writers recount Emperor Claudius adding crushed pearls to wine and flecks of gold to peas solely to increase their cost. <b>Others</b> recall <b>live</b> <b>animals</b> being served as shows of entertainment and richness. For instance, at one event mackerels were pickled live in order to showcase their silvery bodies thrashing in vinegar. Overall, Roman aristocrats desired to showcase their wealth and luxury through the presentation of food.|$|R
50|$|Fish and <b>other</b> aquatic <b>animals</b> <b>live</b> in a {{different}} light environment than terrestrial species. Water absorbs light so that with increasing depth the amount of light available decreases quickly. The optical properties of water also lead to different wavelengths of light being absorbed to different degrees. For example, visible light of long wavelengths (e.g. red, orange) is absorbed quicker than light of shorter wavelengths (green, blue). Ultraviolet light (even shorter wavelength than violet) is absorbed quicker yet. Besides these universal qualities of water, different bodies of water may absorb light of different wavelengths due to varying salt and/or chemical presence in the water.|$|R
