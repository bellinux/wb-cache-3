5|$|Otto Frank survived his {{internment}} in Auschwitz. After the war ended, {{he returned}} to Amsterdam, where he was sheltered by Jan and Miep Gies as he attempted to locate his family. He learned {{of the death of}} his wife, Edith, in Auschwitz, but remained hopeful that his daughters had survived. After several weeks, he discovered Margot and Anne had also died. He attempted to determine the fates of his daughters' friends and learned many had been murdered. Sanne Ledermann, often mentioned in Anne's diary, had been gassed along with her parents; her sister, Barbara, a close friend of Margot's, had survived. Several of the Frank sisters' school friends had survived, as had the extended families of <b>Otto</b> <b>and</b> <b>Edith</b> Frank, as they had fled Germany during the mid-1930s, with individual family members settling in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States.|$|E

Shortly before going into hiding, Anne gave her friend and neighbour, Toosje Kupers, a book, a tea set, a tin of marbles, and the family cat for safekeeping. As the Associated Press reports: [...] "'I'm worried about my marbles, because I'm scared they might fall into the wrong hands,' Kupers said Anne told her. 'Could you keep them for me for a little while?'" ...|$|E

50|$|Margot Betti Frank, {{named after}} {{maternal}} aunt Bettina Holländer (1898-1914), {{was born in}} Frankfurt, Germany, to Jewish parents, and lived in the outer suburbs of the city with her parents, <b>Otto</b> Frank <b>and</b> <b>Edith</b> Frank-Holländer, <b>and</b> also her younger sister Anne Frank, {{during the early years}} of her life.|$|R
50|$|Margot Betti Frank (February 16, 1926 - February 1945) was {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of <b>Otto</b> Frank <b>and</b> <b>Edith</b> Frank <b>and</b> the older sister of Anne Frank. Margot's deportation {{order from the}} Gestapo hastened the Frank family into hiding. According to the diary of her younger sister, Anne, Margot kept a diary of her own, but no trace of Margot's diary has ever been found. She died in Bergen-Belsen.|$|R
25|$|Ultimately {{the entire}} Frank family went into hiding. However, they were betrayed and interned in {{concentration}} camps. <b>Otto's</b> wife, <b>Edith,</b> <b>and</b> daughters, Margot and Anne, died at Bergen-Belsen.|$|R
50|$|The series {{begins in}} June 1942, in wartime and Nazi {{occupied}} Amsterdam. Annelies Marie Frank, a teenage Jewish girl, is celebrating her 13th birthday - amongst her birthday presents, she {{is given a}} red diary. Days later, call up papers arrive for her 16-year-old sister Margot and her parents, <b>Otto</b> <b>and</b> <b>Edith,</b> decide to hasten their plan to go into hiding {{to ensure that the}} family does not get separated.|$|E
50|$|The next morning, 6 July 1942, the Franks head to Otto's pectin {{and spice}} company. They proceed up to a Secret Annex {{at the back}} of the building. Only the {{trustworthy}} office staff, such as Miep Gies, know of their existence and have agreed to help them survive. In the annex they must obey strict rules, remaining completely silent during working hours. <b>Otto</b> <b>and</b> <b>Edith</b> sleep in one room, with Margot and Anne next door in another. At the very top of the building is a disused attic for storing food. This soon becomes Anne's getaway, as she is able to gaze outside at a chestnut tree and the tower of the Westerkerk.|$|E

500|$|Two {{months after}} Kahn's death, Reich {{accepted}} her friend, Annie Pink (1902–1971), as an analysand. Pink was Reich's fourth female patient, {{a medical student}} three months shy of her 19th birthday. He {{had an affair with}} her too, and married her in March 1922 at her father's insistence, with psychoanalysts <b>Otto</b> Fenichel <b>and</b> <b>Edith</b> Buxbaum as witnesses. [...] became a well-known psychoanalyst herself. The marriage produced two daughters, [...] (1924–2008) and Lore (b. 1928), both of whom became physicians; Lore Reich Rubin also became a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst.|$|R
50|$|On July 5, 1942, Anne's {{older sister}} Margot {{received}} an official summons {{to report to}} a Nazi work camp in Germany, and on July 6, Margot and Anne went into hiding with their father <b>Otto</b> <b>and</b> mother <b>Edith.</b> They were joined by Hermann van Pels, Otto's business partner, including his wife Auguste and their teenage son Peter. Their hiding place was in the sealed-off upper rooms of the annex {{at the back of}} Otto's company building in Amsterdam. Otto Frank started his business, named Opekta, in 1933. He was licensed to manufacture and sell pectin, a substance used to make jam. He stopped running his business while everybody was in hiding. But once he returned, he found his employees running it. The rooms that everybody hid in were concealed behind a movable bookcase in the same building as Opekta. Mrs. van Pels's dentist, Fritz Pfeffer, joined them four months later. In the published version, names were changed: The van Pelses are known as the Van Daans, and Fritz Pfeffer as Albert Dussel. With the assistance of a group of Otto Frank's trusted colleagues, they remained hidden for two years and one month.|$|R

50|$|With {{her husband}} Jan Gies, {{and the other}} Opekta employees, Victor Kugler, Johannes Kleiman, and Bep Voskuijl, Miep Gies helped hide <b>Otto</b> <b>and</b> <b>Edith</b> Frank, their daughters Margot and Anne, Hermann and his wife Auguste van Pels, their son Peter, and Fritz Pfeffer in several upstairs rooms in the company's office {{building}} on Amsterdam's Prinsengracht from July 6, 1942 to August 4, 1944. In an interview, Gies said {{she was glad to}} help the families hide because she was extremely concerned about them seeing what was happening to the Jews in Amsterdam. Every day, she saw trucks loaded with Jews heading to the railway station from where the trains left for Nazi concentration camps. She did not tell anyone, not even her own foster parents, about the people in hiding whom she was assisting.|$|E
5000|$|Sanne was {{admitted}} to a Montessori School, where she befriended Anne Frank and Hanneli Goslar. In 1940, the Nazis invaded the Netherlands, and Sanne had {{to move to a}} Jewish school. Hanneli and Anne moved to a different Jewish school. However, Sanne still kept good contacts with both Anne and Hanneli, and {{was a member of the}} ping pong club Little Dipper Minus Two (they had thought the little dipper had five stars for the five girls who were in the club, while there were actually seven stars, thus they called it [...] "Little Dipper Minus Two"), which was formed by her friends. In July 1942, Anne and her family (Margot, <b>Otto,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Edith,</b> along with the van Pels family and Fritz Pfeffer) went into hiding, although Sanne didn't know about this.|$|E
