40|$|Smackover Field, {{discovered}} in 1922, {{is an excellent}} example of the methodology of heavy oil handling and loss in early 20 th century flush production fields. Emulsion problems and waste were severe; millions of barrels of heavy oil were stored in earthen pits for up to a decade, and millions of barrels of oil were lost to land and water. The largest quantity of crude oil waste was from the inadequate handling and treatment of water-in-oil emulsions. Crude oil loss was also associated with earthen storage both on leases and in large tank farms. Lease storage pits served numerous purposes and had the most complex fluid his-tory. Many were used for decades as saltwater disposal pits fol-lowing the flush <b>oil</b> <b>period.</b> Large earthen tank farms on the field edge stored millions of barrels of heavy oil in the 1920 s and 1930 s but were not used for saltwater storage. Today the farms exist within young forests where the ground is hardened by as-phaltic deposits associated with both earthen construction and seepage loss. Drainage areas also provide a record of the exten-sive waste oil history. Asphaltic layers are most prominent in creek areas that did not burn, but degraded oil exists to some ex-tent in almost all field drainage areas...|$|R

Methods Thirty-seven men with metabolic syndrome completed an open and balanced crossover study. Treatment periods lasted for 6 to 8 weeks and they were separated from each other with an eight-week washout period. Subjects maintained their normal dietary habits and physical activity without major variations. The daily fat adjunct consisted either of 37. 5 grams of butter or 35 mL of Virgino R CPTRO.

This paper also adds to the strong body of evidence supporting the hypothesis that market returns are influenced by factors that affect business conditions, such as oil price shocks. The key findings are that there are asymmetric reactions to OPEC policy decisions during conflict periods for the US and UK stock markets. During conflict <b>periods,</b> <b>oil</b> markets require time to incorporate OPEC decisions.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{effect on}} blood {{pressure}} (BP) of replacing dietary saturated fat with either poh/un-saturated fat (linoleic acid) or carbohydrate was studied in 21 untreated mildly hypertensive patients. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover protocol, all subjects received dietary supplements of cream, safflower oil, and carbohydrate in random sequence, each prepared in flavored yogurt or milk. Each supplement was administered for 6 weeks {{and followed by}} a 4 -week washout period of no supplementation. Dietary linoleic acid increased from 4. 6 to 13 % of energy intake when the safflower oil replaced cream, while saturated fat decreased from 16 to 10 %. Total fat intake was 37 to 38 % during the cream and safflower <b>oil</b> <b>periods</b> but was 28 % during the carbohydrate period. Compliance with the diets was demonstrated by significant changes in fasting plasma fatty acid measurements. Mean clinic BP was 135 ± 9 / 93 ± 6 mm Hg at baseline. There {{were no significant differences}} in BP measured in the clinic or at home among the three dietary periods. The protocol had more than 80 % power to detect a mean effect of diet of 3 mm Hg systolic or 2 mm Hg diastolic BP. Therefore, replacing dietary saturated fat with carbohydrate or with linoleic acid does not affect BP in subjects with mild hypertension.

40|$|During severe {{oil price}} downturns, many {{operating}} companies {{reduce or eliminate}} large investments with long time horizons such as exploratory drilling campaigns. This reduction in investments forces rig and drilling services providers to reduce their bids to be competitive. The result of this is lower initial investment in {{the oil and gas}} projects. In this research, a valuation approach is implemented to study the impact of this investment reduction on the decision-making process for executing exploratory drilling campaigns during low <b>oil</b> price <b>periods.</b> It is demonstrated that postponing exploration campaigns during low <b>oil</b> price <b>periods</b> does not necessary maximize value creation. Value creation from investment in low price periods results from the combination of uncertainty and flexibility. The analysis of the value of flexibility (optionality) is usually referred to as Real Options Valuation (ROV). In this work, one of the most versatile approach for valuing options is applied: The Least-Square Monte Carlo Method (LSM). Two uncertainties were considered: oil price and drilling cost. Among the different oil price models, the two-factor stochastic price process developed by Schwartz and Smith (2000) was chosen because of its balance between realism and ease of communication to the managers. Drilling cost is modeled as a Geometric Brownian Motion process. By implementing a delayed correlation between the drilling cost and the oil price, the cost reduction observed in the market is accounted for. In this research, it is shown how real option valuation can be used to determine the optimal time to start the exploratory drilling campaign. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that by including the correlation between the drilling cost and the oil price, the optimal time to execute the investment is during the year with the lowest expected oil price. The impact of this correlation is studied through the use of sensitivity analyses of the project value with respect to the correlation factor and the parameters in the stochastic price model. It is concluded that considering this correlation leads to more realistic project value estimations, resulting in portfolio decisions that maximize stakeholder value. The key contribution of this thesis is the use of option valuating methods to demonstrate that value will be created by initiating the exploratory drilling campaigns during low <b>oil</b> price <b>periods.</b> The real option model developed in this research is applicable to all types of exploration projects in the petroleum industry...|$|R
