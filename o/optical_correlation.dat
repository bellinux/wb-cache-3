This technique draws upon {{recent developments in}} implementing <b>optical</b> <b>correlation</b> measurements in a nonlinear estimator, which relates the <b>optical</b> <b>correlation</b> measurements to the pose states (orientation and position). For the optical correlator, the use of both conjugate filters and binary, phase-only filters {{in the design of}} synthetic discriminant function (SDF) filters is explored. A static neural network is trained a priori and used as the nonlinear estimator. New commercial animation and image rendering software is exploited to design the SDF filters and to generate a large filter set with which to train the neural network. The technique is applied to pose estimation for rendezvous and docking of free-flying spacecraft and to terrestrial surface mobility systems for NASA's Vision for Space Exploration.

40|$|This chapter covers some of {{the latest}} {{developments}} in <b>optical</b> <b>correlation</b> techniques for face recognition using the concept of spectral fusion and placing a special emphasis on its practical aspects and applications for face recognition. <b>Optical</b> <b>correlation</b> is reviewed as a method to carry out instantly a decision on the target form (form to be recognized). A range of relevant practical topics is discussed, such as JTC (Joint Transform Correlator) and the Vander-Lugt architectures. Both of them are based on the " 4 f" optical setup and on a comparison between the target image and a reference image. The similarity between the two images is achieved by the detection of a correlation peak. The development of suitable algorithms for <b>optical</b> <b>correlation</b> and new technologies in electro-optical interfaces has significantly improved the processing capacity of optical correlators and reduce their sizes. To overcome the limitations of a decision taken by a simple detection of a correlation peak, more complex decision algorithms are required.

5000|$|Another {{paper of}} Albert Einstein and {{coworkers}} (see EPR paradox), almost immediately contradicted by Niels Bohr, concerned {{the interpretation of}} quantum mechanics. This was in 1935. According to Bohr, this new theory should be probabilistic, whereas according to Einstein it should be deterministic. Notably, the underlying quantum mechanical theory, i.e. the set of [...] "theorems" [...] derived by it, seemed to be identical. Einstein even assumed {{that it would be}} sufficient to add to quantum mechanics [...] "hidden variables" [...] to enforce determinism. However, thirty years later, in 1964, John Bell found a theorem, involving complicated <b>optical</b> <b>correlations</b> (see Bell inequalities), which yielded measurably different results using Einstein's axioms compared to using Bohr's axioms.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{correlation}} between the average temporal decay (αX,avg,> 200 s) and early-time luminosity (LX, 200 s) of X-ray afterglows of gamma-ray bursts as observed by Swift-XRT. Both quantities are measured relative to a rest frame time of 200 s after the γ-ray trigger. The luminosity average decay correlation {{does not depend on}} specific temporal behavior and contains one scale independent quantity minimizing the role of selection effects. This is a complementary correlation to that discovered by Oates et al. (2012) in the optical light curves observed by Swift-UVOT. The correlation indicates that on average, more luminous X-ray afterglows decay faster than less luminous ones, indicating some relative mechanism for energy dissipation. The X-ray and <b>optical</b> <b>correlations</b> are entirely consistent once corrections are applied and contamination is removed. We explore the possible biases introduced by different light curve morphologies and observational selection effects, and how either geometrical effects or intrinsic properties of the central engine and jet could explain the observed correlation.

In this paper, we present results which link metallographic observations of surface slip and related topographic changes directly to corresponding changes in <b>optical</b> <b>correlation</b> intensity, during uniaxial tensile straining of a stainless steel heat treated to two different initial conditions.
