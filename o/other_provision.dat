The input of heat into an inherently endergonic reaction, such as the elimination of cyclohexanol to cyclohexene, can be seen as coupling an unfavourable reaction (elimination) to a favourable one (burning of coal or <b>other</b> <b>provision</b> of heat) such that the total entropy change of the universe is {{greater than or equal to}} zero, making the total Gibbs free energy difference of the coupled reactions negative.|$|E
500|$|After {{losing his}} {{appeal to the}} Second Circuit, Afroyim asked the Supreme Court to {{overrule}} the precedent it had established in Perez, strike down the foreign voting provision of the Nationality Act as unconstitutional, and decide {{that he was still}} a United States citizen. Afroyim's counsel argued that since [...] "neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor any <b>other</b> <b>provision</b> of the Constitution expressly grants Congress the power to take away [...] citizenship once it has been acquired ... the only way [...] could lose his citizenship was by his own voluntary renunciation of it." [...] The Supreme Court agreed to consider Afroyim's case on October 24, 1966 and held oral arguments on February 20, 1967.|$|E
500|$|The {{focus of}} the NWP shifted to {{equality}} under the law, including equal employment opportunities, jury service, nationality for married women and any <b>other</b> <b>provision</b> which legally prohibited women from having full legal equality. In 1923, the Equal Rights Amendment was introduced by Daniel Read Anthony, Jr. and the women pushed for its passage, lobbying for support from both political parties. Stevens served as vice chair of NWP’s New York branch, spearheading the NWP Women for Congress campaign in 1924. Unable to run herself due to her having established a legal residence in France, Stevens worked toward the goal of securing the election of 100 women to Congress in states where female candidates were among contenders for office. The campaign had negligible results and the women shifted back to equality measures. Beginning in 1926, one of the proposals Stevens focused on {{for the next several}} years was the [...] "Wages for Wives" [...] marriage contract. Campaigning vigorously for its adoption, the [...] "Wages for Wives" [...] proposal called for a flexible contract which split marital assets 50-50 rather than treating married couples as a single entity and called for women to be paid a wage for domestic services and raising children as a protection for children's continuous support.|$|E
30|$|Based on the {{previously}} described vague formulation that companies must disclose {{more information on}} <b>other</b> <b>provisions</b> {{when there is no}} separate presentation in the balance sheet and the corresponding <b>other</b> <b>provisions</b> are worth a substantial amount, we investigate whether we observe a relationship between the disclosure of <b>other</b> <b>provisions</b> and the ratio of <b>other</b> <b>provisions</b> and total assets. Surprisingly, we do not observe any relationship between those two variables.|$|R
30|$|In addition, we further {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} disclosure {{and the effects of}} the German Accounting Law Modernization Act on financial reporting properties by examining companies’ disclosure behavior regarding <b>other</b> <b>provisions.</b> We choose this balance sheet item based on the previously described significant changes regarding measurement after the German Accounting Law Modernization Act, such as consideration of future wage and salary adjustments and the required discounting of <b>other</b> <b>provisions</b> with a maturity over 12  months. <b>Other</b> <b>provisions</b> offer an appropriate possibility to investigate companies’ willingness to disclose information because § 285 (12) German GAAP only provides the vague formulation that companies must disclose more information on specific <b>other</b> <b>provisions</b> when there is no separate presentation in the balance sheet and recent <b>other</b> <b>provisions</b> are worth a substantial amount. The term “substantial” is open to interpretation.|$|R
30|$|Second, we {{investigate}} whether companies disclose information on discounting their <b>other</b> <b>provisions.</b> The {{results of the}} investigation regarding disclosure of the discounting effects {{are similar to those of}} disclosure in consideration of future wage and salary adjustments, as approximately 52 % disclose this information voluntarily. However, it might be argued that the rest of the companies have only <b>other</b> <b>provisions</b> with maturities of less than 1  year. Nevertheless, even in this case, readers of financial statements would appreciate this information because, otherwise, they will not know anything about the maturity structure of <b>other</b> <b>provisions.</b> Our disclosure investigation reveals that all companies without discounting information did not publish any information regarding the maturity structure of their <b>other</b> <b>provisions.</b> Many companies indicate that they use the required 7 -year averaged discount rate published by the German Central Bank. As those companies do not disclose any information regarding the maturity structure of their <b>other</b> <b>provisions,</b> the disclosed information is useless. Only 16 % disclose their discount rate explicitly and only 16 % explain measurement changes or differences resulting from the adoption of the German Accounting Law Modernization Act. In summary, our investigation of disclosure compliance for <b>other</b> <b>provisions</b> also reveals substantial variation.|$|R

2500|$|The Twenty-seventh Amendment was {{approved}} by referendum on 11 June 2004, voting taking place concurrently with European elections and local elections, and became law on 24 June.

2500|$|Also in 1878, a {{provision}} later known as section 5 of the Civil Law Act was introduced into Straits Settlements law. The provision stated {{that if a}} question or issue arose locally with respect to certain named categories of law or with respect to mercantile law generally, the law to be administered {{was to be the}} same as that administered in England at the corresponding period, unless <b>other</b> <b>provision</b> had been made by any law having force locally. It was felt the provision was needed because the Straits Settlements Supreme Court had a tendency to follow English case law premised on the existence of statutes that were not in force in the Colony. There was also a general sentiment that the common law should be common to the whole Empire. However, the manner in which section 5 was worded created much difficulty in determining whether particular English statutes applied locally. Despite major amendments to the provision in 1979, the problems with it were not resolved until it was finally repealed in 1993 (...) [...]|$|E
2500|$|Although the California Cannabis Coalition {{decision}} was narrow, {{it has been}} heavily criticized because {{in an effort to}} grant deference to the local initiative power, “the court erred in the opposite direction by adopting an overly narrow reading of Proposition 218.” [...] Another article noted: [...] "The court's decision represents a ridiculously narrow vision of what was intended by Proposition 218." [...] Proposition 218 constitutionally requires that its provisions be “liberally construed to effectuate its purposes of limiting local government revenue and enhancing taxpayer consent.” [...] The California Supreme Court has also previously stated that the constitutional provisions of Proposition 218 are of dignity at least equal to other provisions of the California Constitution. In addition, Proposition 218 also makes it expressly clear with prefacing language that its constitutional requirements applicable to taxes shall apply “otwithstanding any <b>other</b> <b>provision</b> of this Constitution.” [...] The local initiative power is provided for in an “other provision of this Constitution.” [...] None of the foregoing were referenced in the majority opinion in the California Cannabis Coalition case.|$|E
2500|$|As amended, Article 2 {{provides}} that everyone {{born on the}} island of Ireland has the right {{to be a part of}} the 'Irish Nation'. The apparent intention is partly to allow the people of Northern Ireland, if they wish, to feel included in the 'nation' without making what might be perceived as a revanchist claim. However, it has been argued that [...] "the new Article 2 of the Irish constitution gave northern nationalists nothing". After all, Article 9 of the Constitution of Ireland governs Irish citizenship. It {{provides that}} the [...] "future loss and acquisition of Irish nationality and citizenship shall be determined in accordance with law". Since it was [...] further amended in 2004, Article 9 now also provides that [...] "otwithstanding any <b>other</b> <b>provision</b> of this Constitution, a person born in the island of Ireland, which includes its islands and seas, who does not have, at the time of the birth of that person, at least one parent who is an Irish citizen or entitled to be an Irish citizen is not entitled to Irish citizenship or nationality, unless provided for by law." [...] Citizenship rights created by Article 2 of the Constitution have therefore since been severely diluted. All of this cuts across what, on an isolated reading of Article 2, might suggest that Article 2 confers the right to citizenship on all persons born in Northern Ireland.|$|E
