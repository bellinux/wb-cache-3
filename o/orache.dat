5|$|At Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton {{the wooded}} cliff and a narrow salt marsh are {{supported}} by rocks of Devonian sandstone and Carboniferous limestone, overlain by with Triassic Dolomitic conglomerate. The site's principal interest {{and the reason for}} its designation as an SSSI is the presence of a population of the True Service-tree (Sorbus domestica) growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of Sorbus here are the whitebeams Sorbus eminens and Sorbus anglica, both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally scarce Large-leaved Lime (Tilia platyphyllos) also occurs, and herbs include Field garlic (Allium oleraceum) and Pale St. John's-wort (Hypericum montanum). The saltmarsh vegetation, which lies {{at the base of the}} cliff, is predominantly made up of Sea Aster (Aster tripolium) and English Scurvygrass (Cochlearia anglica). There are however two nationally scarce vascular plant species here as wellâ€“ Slender Hare's-ear (Bupleurum tenuissimum) and Long-stalked <b>Orache</b> (Atriplex longipes).|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus {{reports that}} cabbage, radish and turnip are sown in July after the summer solstice, along with beet, lettuce, mustard and coriander. Leeks, celery, onion and <b>orache</b> are sown in January. Cucumber, gourds, basil, {{purslane}} and savory, in contrast, he writes, are sown in April. Ripe seeds do not germinate at once but {{wait for the}} right time. He asserts that all the herbs can be grown from seed, while rue, marjoram and basil can be raised from cuttings, and garlic, onion and other bulbs are grown from their roots. All the flowers of a herb appear at one time, except for basil which puts {{out a series of}} flowers starting low on the plant. Cumin has the most fruits, but it is said you have to curse and insult the plant to get a good crop. Theophrastus describes varieties of some herbs, for instance that the white lettuce is sweetest and tenderest, while there are many kinds of onion, with Sardian, Cnidian, Samothracian and Ascalonian varieties from those regions. Garlic is said to be planted close to the solstice; the Cyprian variety is largest and is used in salads. All herbs except rue are said to like dung. Of the wild herbs, Theophrastus reports that some such as cat's ear are edible, whereas others like dandelion are too bitter to be worth eating.|$|E
25|$|Some seeds {{usually made}} into gruel in {{historical}} times are acorn and manna grass (Glyceria fluitans). Roots {{of the sea}} beet, Beta maritima, were prepared as well. That species is ancestral to modern domestic beets. Greens could have been boiled from nettle (Urtica dioica), <b>orache</b> (Atriplex) and goosefoot (Chenopodium album).|$|E
50|$|The {{species can}} be found on <b>oraches</b> and chenopods, which is their main food.|$|R
50|$|The {{site is a}} {{large area}} of {{saltmarsh}} together with some 12 ha of shell bank. Birds which breed on the shell bank include little terns and ringed plovers, and there many species on the saltmarsh. There are flora such as yellow-horned poppies, grass-leaved <b>oraches</b> and rock samphires.|$|R
50|$|The shingle ridge {{supports}} a maritime plant community; species present here include sea kale, sea beet, sea campion, thrift and yellow horned poppy. Around {{the edges of}} the lagoon, saltmarsh plant communities are present, with species such as sea aster, sea purslane, Danish scurvygrass and saltmarsh <b>oraches.</b> Grey mullet are found in the lagoon.|$|R
500|$|Green borscht (...) , a light soup {{made from}} leaf vegetables, {{is an example}} common in Ukrainian and Russian cuisines. The {{naturally}} tart-tasting sorrel is most commonly used, but spinach, chard, nettle, garden <b>orache</b> and occasionally dandelion, goutweed or ramsons, may be added as well, especially after the spring season for sorrel has passed. Like beetroot borscht, {{it is based on}} meat or vegetable broth and is typically served with boiled potatoes and hard-boiled eggs, sprinkled with dill. There is also a variety of Ukrainian green borscht which includes both sorrel and beetroots.|$|E
6000|$|In {{a letter}} just {{received}} from Mr. Henslow, {{he gives a}} few additional illustrations of his views, of which the following are the most important: [...] "Passing to Incompletae, the orders known collectively as 'Cyclospermeae' are related to Caryophylleae; and to my mind are degradations from it, of which <b>Orache</b> is anemophilous. Cupuliferae have an inferior ovary and rudimentary calyx-limb on the top. These, as far as I know, cannot be interpreted except as degradations. The whole of Monocotyledons appear to me (from anatomical reasons especially) to be degradations from Dicotyledons, and primarily {{through the agency of}} growth in water. Many subsequently became terrestrial, but retained the effects of their primitive habitat through heredity. The 3-merous [sic] perianth of grasses, the parts of the flower being in whorls, point to a degradation from a sub-liliaceous condition." ...|$|E

40|$|During 2003 - 2004, field {{surveys were}} {{realized}} {{to observe the}} distribution of sugar beet aphid, Pemphigus fuscicornis (K o c h) (Sternorrhyncha Pemphigidae) in southwestern Slovakia. The research was carried out at 60 different localities with altitudes 112 - 220 m a. s. l. Sugar beet root aphid was recorded at 30 localities. The aphid was recorded in Slovakia for the first time, but its occurrence was predicted and symptoms and harmfulness overlooked by now. The presence of P. fuscicornis was investigated on roots of various plants from Chenopodiaceae. The most important host plants were various species of lambsquarters (above all Chenopodium album). Furthermore sugar beet (Beta vulgaris provar. altissima), red beet (B. vulgaris provar. conditiva) and <b>oraches</b> (Atriplex spp) act as host plants. Infestation of sugar beet by P. fuscicornis never exceeded 5 % at single locality in Slovakia. Dry and warm weather create presumptions for strong harmfulness. In Slovakia, Chenopodium album {{is a very important}} indicator of sugar beet aphid presence allowing evaluation of control requirements. During the study, the larvae of Thaumatomyia glabra (Diptera: Chloropidae) were detected as important natural enemies of sugar beet aphid. The species occurred at each location evaluated...|$|R
