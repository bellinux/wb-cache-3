5|$|Increasing costs: due {{to higher}} costs {{of fuel and}} insurance, and due to greater {{regulation}} requiring equipment such as new radios, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> transponders, gliding costs have increased, although without the continuous use of engines and fuel, they are still considerably lower than traditional power flying.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{every nation}} has {{associated}} blood drinking {{with some kind}} of revenant or demon, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> a deity. In India, for example, tales of vetālas, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the Baitāl Pacīsī; a prominent story in the Kathāsaritsāgara tells of King Vikramāditya and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. Piśāca, the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{gathering}} CCTV – Some ambulances are {{now being}} fitted with video cameras used to record activity either inside or outside the vehicle. They may also be fitted with sound recording facilities. This {{can be used as}} a form of protection from violence against ambulance crews, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> (dependent on local laws) to prove or disprove cases where a member of crew stands accused of malpractice.|$|E
5000|$|Some rockets like Antares (rocket), Falcon 9 used a {{structure}} called strongback {{to restrain the}} rocket prior to launch and reclined to several degrees away from the rocket to clear the launch, moment at liftoff <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>case</b> a few minutes.|$|R
30|$|<b>In</b> either methane <b>or</b> {{carbon dioxide}} injection, the rise seemly {{followed}} a linear regression with a curvature above which it increased drastically. The curvature {{was taken as}} bubble-point pressure (p b). The curvature (<b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>case</b> the apparent flattening) {{may be attributed to}} a pseudo-liquid–liquid equilibrium between the heavy and light fractions of the crude.|$|R
50|$|Yvette is female given name, the French {{feminine}} form of Yves, {{which means}} yew <b>or</b> archer <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|R
5|$|Men {{spent their}} free time doing crafts such as woodworking, rugmaking, {{leatherwork}} and photography. Outdoor activities included hiking and swimming. Men formed choirs and music ensembles, performing in neighboring towns when relations were good. The men earned two days of furlough for each month of service. These days could be saved to allow enough time to travel several hundred miles home <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> traded to other men in exchange for cash.|$|E
5|$|Pendragon's only form of defence in {{the game}} {{is his ability to}} utilise various magical spells, in which the correct spell is {{required}} in order to defeat certain enemies. If the player is hit by an attack of any enemy in the castle, Pendragon will lose energy, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> time will be deducted from the countdown timer. If the player completely runs out of energy or fails to destroy the Staff of Karnath before midnight, the game will end.|$|E
5|$|The pilgrimage occurs {{from the}} 8th to 12th (<b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> 13th) of Dhu al-Hijjah, {{the last month}} of the Islamic {{calendar}}. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and the Islamic year is about eleven days shorter than the Gregorian year, the Gregorian date of Hajj changes from year to year. Ihram is the name given to the special spiritual state in which pilgrims wear two white sheets of seamless cloth and abstain from certain actions.|$|E

2500|$|Greek {{deportees}} {{were sent}} to live in Greek villages in the inner provinces <b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>case,</b> villages where Armenians were living before being deported. Greek villages evacuated during the war due to military concerns were then resettled with Muslim immigrants and refugees. According to cables sent to the provinces during this time, abandoned movable and non-movable Greek property {{was not to be}} liquidated, as that of the Armenians, but [...] "preserved".|$|R
5|$|This {{species is}} {{classified}} as vulnerable as its dwindling and fragmented populations are threatened by habitat destruction. A conservation plan has been drawn up for this species, and research into its current distribution is ongoing. Some of the indigenous peoples of Cameroon either respect this species <b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> fear it. Today, this rockfowl {{is considered one of}} Africa’s most desirable birds by birders and is a symbol of ecotourism across its range.|$|E
5|$|By the 21st century {{many of the}} Device Forts {{had been}} damaged by, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> lost entirely, to coastal erosion; the problem had existed at some {{locations}} since the 16th century and still persists, for example at Hurst. East Cowes Castle and East Tilbury Fort have been entirely lost, while the East Blockhouse, Mersea and Sandsfoot have been badly damaged, a third of Sandgate and most of St Andrews have been washed away. Other sites were demolished, built upon or simply eroded over time; almost no trace remains of the bulwarks along the Downs, for example. The remaining sites are protected by UK conservation law, either as scheduled monuments or listed buildings.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, <b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a drop of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a pale blue.|$|E

5|$|Deaths usually occur from {{respiratory}} failure or ventricular fibrillation secondary to ongoing seizure activity; fatalities have occurred {{within a few}} hours of ingestion. Poisoned people who recover usually regain consciousness and seizures cease within 24 to 48hours of poisoning, although seizures may persist for up to 96 hours. There are occasional long-term effects such as retrograde amnesia of the events leading to intoxication and the intoxication itself. Other ongoing mild effects may include restlessness, muscle weakness, twitching, and anxiety. Complete resolution of symptoms may take a number of days <b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> these ongoing symptoms may persist for months after poisoning.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the second}} trial, a further 26 {{defendants}} were still {{due to be}} tried on charges relating to the riot. The Crown Prosecution Service accepted plea bargains where defendants pleaded guilty to violent disorder {{in exchange for the}} dropping of other charges, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> all charges were dropped completely. On 20 September 1993 the last remaining defendant to maintain a plea of not guilty went on trial, and he was convicted of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and sentenced to thirty months imprisonment.|$|E
5|$|In general, seabirds live longer, breed {{later and}} have fewer young than other birds do, but they invest {{a great deal}} of time in their young. Most species nest in colonies, which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for {{undertaking}} long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely.|$|E
50|$|The Service in Israel Medal {{is awarded}} to {{military}} attachés who serve {{at least two}} years in Israel upon the end of their assignment with the IDF. First instituted in 2007, it is still a somewhat rare decoration and there are certain restrictions regarding its display (<b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>case,</b> even its mention) for U.S. personnel stationed in other Middle Eastern Arab countries who are on unfriendly terms with Israel. These include the UAE, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia.|$|R
50|$|Insecurity may {{contribute}} to the development of shyness, paranoia and social withdrawal, or alternatively it may encourage compensatory behaviors such as , aggression, <b>or</b> bullying, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases.</b>|$|R

5|$|Over {{the next}} decades, Adler would play in (<b>or,</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> merely produce) {{numerous}} plays by Gordin, but also classics by Shakespeare, Schiller, Lessing; Eugène Scribe's La Juive; dramatizations of George du Maurier's Trilby and Alexandre Dumas, fils' Camille; and {{the works of}} modern playwrights such as Gorky, Ibsen, Shaw, Strindberg, Gerhart Hauptmann, Victor Hugo, Victorien Sardou, and Leonid Andreyev. Frequently {{the works of the}} great contemporary playwrights—even Shaw, who was writing in English—would be staged in New York in Yiddish years, even decades, before they were ever staged there in English.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids are {{vulnerable}} to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic flotsam {{is a problem for}} the family as it is for many other seabirds. Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the Barau's petrel, the Newell's shearwater or the Cory's shearwater, which nest high up on large developed islands are victims of light pollution. Chicks that are fledging are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of fledging Barau's petrels are attracted to the streetlights on Réunion.|$|E
5|$|Symptoms {{may also}} occur during a gradual dosage reduction, but are {{typically}} less severe and may persist {{as part of}} a protracted withdrawal syndrome for months after cessation of benzodiazepines. Approximately 10% of patients experience a notable protracted withdrawal syndrome, which can persist for many months <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> a year or longer. Protracted symptoms tend to resemble those seen during the first couple of months of withdrawal but usually are of a sub-acute level of severity. Such symptoms do gradually lessen over time, eventually disappearing altogether.|$|E

5|$|The book {{begins by}} {{describing}} conditions aboard Iowa before the explosion. Thompson depicts Moosally, the ship's captain, as an inept seaman who gained {{command of the}} battleship through political connections. Under Moosally's leadership, or lack thereof, Iowa operated with severe training and safety deficiencies, {{especially with regard to}} operations with the ship's 16-inch guns. The book details how the ship's Master Chief Fire Controlman, Stephen Skelley, conducted illegal gunnery experiments with the 16-inch guns. Moosally apparently did not check to ensure that the experiments were authorized, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases,</b> appears not to have been aware that they were being carried out.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage caused}} to the North Tower {{destroyed}} any {{means of escape}} at the impact zone or above it. All stairwells and elevators from the 92ndfloor up were rendered impassable, trapping 1,344people. According to the Commission Report, hundreds were killed instantly by the impact; the rest were trapped and died from the subsequent fire and smoke, the eventual collapse, <b>or</b> (<b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases)</b> after jumping or falling from the building. Elevator shafts channeled burning jet fuel through the building. At least one elevator shaft carried burning fuel downward, exploding on the 77thfloor, the 22ndfloor, and at street level on the West Side Lobby.|$|E
5|$|Mummification was a {{tradition}} that many other pre-Columbian civilisations practiced. On the Altiplano, the habit of conserving the dead started in the Herrera Period, around the 5th century AD. The Muisca continued this culture and prepared their deceased beloved {{members of the society}} by putting the bodies above fires. The heat would dry the body and the phenol conserve the organs and protect them from decomposition, a process that took up to eight hours. After drying, the bodies were wrapped in cotton cloths and placed in caves, buried, <b>or</b> <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>cases</b> placed on elevated platforms inside temples, such as the Sun Temple. The position of the mummies was with their arms folded across the chest and the hands around the chin, while the legs were placed over the abdomen. During the preparation of the mummies, the Muisca played music and sang songs honouring their dead. The habit of mummification continued well into the colonial period; the youngest mummies found date from {{the second half of the}} 18th century.|$|E
