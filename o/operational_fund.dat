The organization receives support, advising, and specialized leadership training from the University. Each February, thousands of students and community members attend BuckeyeThon's signature event, a Dance Marathon consisting of two separate 12-hour shifts. In the past 15 years, students have raised over $5 million to support treatment, research, and various therapies at the hospital.

40|$|The {{original}} contribution {{of this article}} resides in the studies {{carried out by the}} Author indicating that a 1 % increase in the profit on sales, against the unaltered remaining financing funds, is connected with a 0. 76 % increase in the EU fund for support of market and capital. Against the EU <b>operational</b> <b>fund,</b> the profit on sales proves negative (- 0. 631). Viewed {{in the context of the}} literature indicating certain difficulties in the determination of the financial security category, the impact of technologies and procedures, the impact of unique resources, the increase of entrepreneurial orientation, and access to EU funding, the present research fills the gap in terms of the determination of the regressive relation between the profit on sales on the one hand, and the EU fund for the support of the market and capital and the EU <b>operational</b> <b>fund</b> on the other. The regressive relation is expressed by flexibility coefficients (parameters) of the power function (model). They contribute to the economic literature with their empirical model based on the Cobb-Douglas power function, whilst the model contributes to the theory related to the financial security of enterprises (model = theory). The principal research tool used in the present study is the Cobb-Douglas power model used to examine the regressive dependency of profit on sales upon the EU <b>operational</b> <b>fund</b> and the EU fund for support of the market and capital as for the years 2014 – 2020. The model has also been used to calculate the marginal and average profitability for the aforesaid funds as measures of the efficiency of their financial security with small- and medium-sized enterprises in Poland. Moreover, the market/capital support fund remains within the sound management zone of the enterprises under research. Originalni doprinos ovog rada sastoji se u rezultatima istraživanja koji pokazuju da je 1 % porasta profita u prodaji, uz neizmijenjene ostale izvore financiranja, povezan s 0, 76 % povećanja europskih fondova za potporu tržišta i kapitala. Kako bi se ispitala priroda regresijskog odnosa između operativnog fonda EU za potporu tržišta i kapitala i profitabilnosti poduzeća, u radu je korišten Cobb-Douglas-ov model. Kao mjere učinkovitosti, u modelu su korišteni empirijski izračuni granične i prosječne profitabilnosti. Istraživanje je provedeno na uzorku malih i srednjih poduzeća u Poljskoj za razdoblje 2014. - 2020. Rezultati istraživanja su potvrdili hipotezu o pozitivnim učincima EU fonda za potporu razvoja tržišta i kapitala na financijsku sigurnost malih i srednjih poduzeća u Poljskoj.

The schools were receiving $ 25, 000 in change funds annually from Ohio Venture Capital 5 -year grants. An operating levy defeat and a community committee's recommendations threatened to close both schools.
