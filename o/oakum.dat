5|$|An {{examination}} of the hull showed that a piece of coral {{the size of a}} man's fist had sliced clean through the timbers and then broken off. Surrounded by pieces of <b>oakum</b> from the fother, this coral fragment had helped plug the hole in the hull and preserved the ship from sinking on the reef.|$|E
5|$|Midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse {{proposed}} fothering the ship, as he {{had previously}} been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully. He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing bits of <b>oakum</b> and wool into an old sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into {{the hole in the}} hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing the crew to stop two of the three pumps.|$|E
5|$|A typical early 19th-century casual ward was {{a single}} large room {{furnished}} {{with some kind of}} bedding and perhaps a bucket {{in the middle of the}} floor for sanitation. The bedding on offer could be very basic: the Poor Law authorities in Richmond in the mid-1840s provided only straw and rags, although beds were available for the sick. In return for their night's accommodation vagrants might be expected to undertake a certain amount of work before leaving the next day, such as at Guisborough, where men were required to break stones for three hours and women to pick <b>oakum,</b> two hours before breakfast and one after. Until the passage of the Casual Poor Act 1882 vagrants could discharge themselves before 11 am on the day following their admission, but from 1883 onwards they were required to be detained until 9 am on the second day. Those who were admitted to the workhouse again within one month were required to be detained until the fourth day after their admission.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the workhouse {{can be traced to}} the Poor Law Act of 1388, which {{attempted}} to address the labour shortages following the Black Death in England by restricting the movement of labourers, and ultimately led to the state becoming responsible for the support of the poor. But mass unemployment following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the introduction of new technology to replace agricultural workers in particular, and a series of bad harvests, meant that by the early 1830s the established system of poor relief was proving to be unsustainable. The New Poor Law of 1834 attempted to reverse the economic trend by discouraging the provision of relief to anyone who refused to enter a workhouse. Some Poor Law authorities hoped to run workhouses at a profit by utilising the free labour of their inmates, who generally lacked the skills or motivation to compete in the open market. Most were employed on tasks such as breaking stones, crushing bones to produce fertiliser, or picking <b>oakum</b> using a large metal nail known as a spike, perhaps the origin of the workhouse's nickname.|$|E

25|$|Hemp {{has been}} grown for millennia in Asia and the Middle East for its fibre. Commercial {{production}} of hemp in the West took off in the eighteenth century, but was grown {{in the sixteenth century}} in eastern England. Because of colonial and naval expansion of the era, economies needed large quantities of hemp for rope and <b>oakum.</b> In the early 1940s, world {{production of hemp}} fiber ranged from 250 000 to 350 000 metric tonnes, Russia was the biggest producer.|$|E
25|$|After six weeks, the Sparrow-Hawk {{reached the}} coast of Massachusetts, and was wrecked at Potanumaquut Harbor Cape Cod. Upon {{reaching}} Cape Cod, the Sparrow-Hawk no longer had fresh water or 'beer'. Captain Johnston was in his cabin, sick and lame with scurvy. At night, the Sparrow-Hawk hit a sand bar but the water was smooth and she laid out an anchor. The morning revealed that the caulking between hull planks - <b>Oakum</b> - had been driven out. High winds drove the Sparrow-Hawk over the bar and into the Harbor. Many goods were rescued and no lives were lost.|$|E
25|$|Orville was {{actively}} involved in his community, making a point to give back and help those less fortunate. One of the big problems then and now was poverty. As a result, Jefferson County established a poor house system paid for by appropriations from each town. In 1826, Hungerford was appointed {{as one of the}} first superintendents of the poor house located on the 150-acre Dudley Farm in Le Ray, New York. People sent to the poor house would have a place to live and would be provided with food and rudimentary medical care in exchange for some work, usually tied in with farming, e.g., picking <b>oakum.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the 210 convicts {{were all}} disembarked a fire was {{discovered}} {{on the ship}} at 4.30 pm on 20 May 1814. It was later thought that the fire was caused by candle snuff being dropped on <b>oakum</b> when an officer and boy had entered the hold. It soon {{became apparent that the}} fire could not be fought and so Three Bees was cut loose from her moorings and the other ships in the cove maneuvered to avoid the ship. At 5.30 pm the first gun exploded on board and a swivel ball smashed into the parlour of the house of Captain Piper, hitting only a writing table. The ship drifted onto Bennelong Point and shortly after her magazine exploded. Three Bees was a total loss.|$|E
25|$|What {{disturbs}} Delano are incidents {{he observes}} among the hatchet polishers, <b>oakum</b> pickers, {{such as when}} a black boy stabs a white one. Apparently Cereno does not care about this behavior, not even when Atufal, a regal-looking slave appears in chains but still refusing to humble himself. The whispering between Cereno and Babo makes Delano feel uncomfortable. Gradually his suspicions increase, as he notes Cereno's sudden waves of dizziness and anxiety, the crew's awkward movements and whisperings, and the unusual interaction of the slaves and the whites. Yet Delano answers Cereno’s questions about the crew, cargo, and arms aboard the Bachelor’s Delight without reserve, reasoning that the innocent are protected by the truth. When The Rover arrives with the supplies, Delano sends her back for more water while he continues to observe curious incidents.|$|E
25|$|The two-story Triangle Market (Thompson & Thompson, 1908; {{rehabilitation}} by Fred Bassetti & Co., 1977) originally {{housed the}} South Park Poultry Company. The 1977 rehabilitation joined {{it with the}} adjacent 3-story Silver <b>Oakum</b> Building (unknown, 1910; Bassetti, 1977). The Outlook Hotel (now LaSalle Hotel; architect unknown; rehabilitation by Bartholick, 1977) also dates from 1908. A legitimate seaman's and workingman's hotel until 1942, its Japanese American operators Rosuke and T.K. Kodama were forcibly interned during World War II. Nellie Curtis took it over, changed the name, and ran it as a brothel into the 1950s. Since 1977 the building has been joined to the adjacent Cliff House (c. 1901), and largely devoted to low-income housing. Shops and the Market PDA office {{are on the ground}} floor. Its roof provides outdoor seating for the restaurant Maximilien.|$|E
25|$|Boats carried <b>oakum</b> and chisels {{to patch}} leaks. There were also boat repair areas, for instance, beside Lock 35 and at Lock 47 (Four Locks), to repair boats. The boat would settle on raised beams (at lock 35, {{they were made}} of concrete), as the drydock was drained, and the men could make the {{necessary}} repairs, using tin and tar. Originally, the canal plans did not have provisions for drydocks or repairs of boats, but by 1838 there were frequent complaints about drifting rafts and wrecks obstructing navigation. The company made provisions for drydocks to help the situation. In the mid-1800s the Canal Company authorized at least 6 drydocks, documented at the following locations: Locks 45-46, Lock 47 (Four Locks), Lock 44 (Shepherdstown), Above Lock 14 (near Carderock), Edwards Ferry (Lock 25), and in the rear of Lock 10 (Seven Locks).|$|E
25|$|Once again, the St. Francis {{reservoir}} level rose, although not without incident. Late {{in the year}} a fracture was noticed which began at the western abutment and ran diagonally upwards and toward the center section for a distance. As with others, Mulholland inspected it, judged it to be another contraction crack and ordered it filled with <b>oakum</b> and grouted to seal off any seepage. At the same time another fracture appeared in a corresponding position on the eastern portion of the dam, starting at the crest near the last spillway section and running downward at an angle for sixty-five feet before ending at the hillside. It too was sealed in the same manner. Both of these fractures were noted to be wider at their junction with the hillside abutments and narrowed as they angled {{toward the top of}} the dam.|$|E
25|$|The San Francisco Maritime State Historical Park {{opened to}} the public on October 2, 1963, and the ship {{opened to the}} public as a museum ship on October 10, 1963. Within years of its opening, serious {{deterioration}} threatened the ship and became critical in August 1969 when a leak raised the rate at which it took on water to 600 gallons per hour and in strong winds to 1,000 gallons per hour. The ships two pumps were capable of handling this flow, but two weeks later the leak doubled to 2,000 gallons per hour. In a dive, the leak was found and staunched with <b>oakum</b> and burlap and it was later reinforced to be fixed at the next dry docking, in November 1970. In October 1972, the United States Congress established the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the San Francisco Maritime State Historical Park was intentionally included in its range. In September 1977, the State of California donated the park and the collections to the federal government and it was reorganized as the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. In 1979, the Wapamas condition had deteriorated to the point that significant repairs were needed to restore the ship's structural integrity and it was placed atop a barge.|$|E
500|$|He {{first entered}} Newgate Prison in London {{for a week}} for processing, then was moved to Pentonville Prison, where the [...] "hard labour" [...] {{to which he had}} been sentenced {{consisted}} of many hours of walking a treadmill and picking <b>oakum</b> (separating the fibres in scraps of old navy ropes), and where prisoners were allowed to read only the Bible and The Pilgrim's Progress. Prisoners were not allowed to speak to each other, and, when out of their cells, were required to wear a cap with a thick veil so they would not be recognised by other prisoners.|$|E
500|$|After {{the peace}} Mary Rose {{was placed in}} the reserves, [...] "in ordinary". She was laid up for {{maintenance}} along with her sister ship the Peter Pomegranate in July 1514. In 1518 she received a routine repair and caulking, waterproofing with tar and <b>oakum</b> (old rope fibres) and was then assigned a small skeleton crew who lived on board the ship until 1522. She served briefly on a mission with other warships to [...] "scour the seas" [...] in preparation for Henry VIII's journey across the Channel to the summit with the French king FrancisI at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in June 1520.|$|E
500|$|In January 1866 George was {{appointed}} headmaster of Liverpool College, {{and the family}} moved to premises in the Dingle area. Despite the new surroundings, Josephine continued to mourn for Eva but focused her feelings on helping others; she later wrote that she [...] "became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find some pain keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself.... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool." [...] She made regular visits to the workhouse at Brownlow Hill, an institution that could hold 5,000 individuals. She would sit with the women in the cellars—many of whom were prisoners—and pick <b>oakum</b> with them, while discussing the Bible or praying with them.|$|E
500|$|On 6 March 1862, {{the ship}} {{departed}} New York bound for Fort Monroe, Virginia, towed by the ocean-going tug Seth Low {{and accompanied by}} the gunboats [...] and [...] Worden, not trusting the seal between the turret and the hull, and ignoring Ericsson's advice, wedged the former in the up position and stuffed <b>oakum</b> and sail cloth in the gap. Rising seas that night washed the <b>oakum</b> away and water poured underneath the turret, {{as well as through}} the hawsepipe, various hatches, ventilation pipes, and the two funnels, so that the belts for the ventilation and boiler fans loosened and fell off and the fires in the boilers were nearly extinguished {{over the course of the}} next day; this created a toxic atmosphere in the engine room that knocked out most of the engine-room crew. First Assistant Engineer Isaac Newton ordered the engine room abandoned and had the able-bodied crew drag the afflicted engine room hands to the top of the turret where the fresh air could revive them. Both Newton and Stimers worked desperately to get the blowers to work, but they too succumbed to the noxious fumes and were taken above. One fireman was able to punch a hole in the fan box, drain the water, and restart the fan. Later that night, the wheel ropes controlling the ship's rudder jammed, making it near impossible to control the ship's heading in the rough seas. Monitor was now in danger of foundering, so Worden signaled Seth Low for help and had Monitor towed to calmer waters closer to shore so she was able to restart her engines later that evening. She rounded Cape Charles around 3:00pm on 8 March and entered Chesapeake Bay, reaching Hampton Roads at 9:00pm, well after the first day's fighting in the Battle of Hampton Roads had concluded.|$|E
500|$|Many {{inmates were}} {{allocated}} tasks in the workhouse such as {{caring for the}} sick or teaching that were beyond their capabilities, but most were employed on [...] "generally pointless" [...] work, such as breaking stones or removing the hemp from telegraph wires. Others picked <b>oakum</b> using a large metal nail known as a spike, {{which may be the}} source of the workhouse's nickname. [...] Bone-crushing, useful in the creation of fertiliser, was a task most inmates could perform, until a government inquiry into conditions in the Andover workhouse in 1845 found that starving paupers were reduced to fighting over the rotting bones {{they were supposed to be}} grinding, to suck out the marrow. [...] The resulting scandal led to the withdrawal of bone-crushing as an employment for those living in workhouses and the replacement of the Poor Law Commission by the Poor Law Board in 1847. Conditions thereafter were regulated according to a list of rules contained in the 1847 Consolidated General Order, which included guidance on issues such as diet, staff duties, dress, education, discipline and redress of grievances.|$|E
500|$|Outside work, {{mostly on}} public infrastructure, {{continued}} beyond the convict era, but gradually declined due to discipline concerns, {{the rise of}} trade unions that saw such work as [...] "a threat to free labour", and an increasing emphasis on work as rehabilitation rather than punishment. By 1911 outside work had all but ceased, but could not adequately be replaced by employment within the prison walls; a lack of suitable work plagued the prison throughout its lifetime. Work in the 19th century consisted of cooking, washing clothes, cleaning the prison, tailoring, bootmaking, and printing. However, demand exceeded the availability of such work – increasingly so in the later years of the 19th century – so prisoners were also given activities with no practical value other than keeping them occupied. These included breaking stones, operating a water pump, and <b>oakum</b> picking. Even with these extra activities, by 1899, 60 to 70 men were employed at the pump, each doing {{only a few minutes}} work per hour, and occupied {{the rest of the time}} with recreation such as draughts.|$|E

2500|$|Preparations for the 1947 {{season began}} in early April, when Chief Engineer R.W. “Bert” Kern {{deported}} Portland for Alaska. [...] In April, the boats were still locked in solid ice. [...] Temperatures the previous winter had reached 68 degrees below zero. [...] To free the hulls from the ice, without {{pulling out the}} <b>oakum</b> caulking between the planking, the crews had to fill the hulls with water, then heat the water by running steam lines through it. [...] The heat generated by the warmed water would gradually melt the ice {{on the outside of}} the hull, without tearing out the <b>oakum.</b> [...] After this, the boats still had to be kept out of the main flow of the river until the May ice jams had passed.|$|E
