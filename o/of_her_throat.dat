500|$|Lazzell {{boarded the}} SS Ivernia on July 3, 1912, bound for Europe {{on a summer}} tour {{arranged}} by the American Travel Club. The tour began in England and continued through the Netherlands, Belgium, and Italy, where Lazzell studied the architecture of churches. In August she left the tour and traveled to Paris, where she stayed at a pension in Montparnasse on the Left Bank. She attended lectures by Florence Heywood and Rossiter Howard, avoided the cafe life, and joined the Students Hostel on Boulevard Saint-Michel. While in Paris, Lazzell took classes at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière, Académie Julian, and Académie Delécluse, eventually settling in at the Académie Moderne where she studied with post-impressionist painter Charles Guérin and David Rosen. Lazzell felt most comfortable at the Moderne, which {{was associated with the}} Parisian avant-garde. She embarked upon a six-week sketching tour of Italy with four other young women in February 1913. The quintet returned to Paris via Germany where Lazzell partook in her first glass of beer in Munich. In April she visited an ear specialist who removed a growth from the back <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat,</b> resulting in what she characterized as [...] "a slight improvement" [...] in her hearing. She continued to study with Guérin, who recognized Lazzell's inclination for landscape art. Lazzell extended her stay in France and attended lectures at the Louvre concerning Flemish paintings, Dutch art and the Italian Renaissance. She returned to the United States at the end of September, sailing from London on the SS Arabic of the White Star Line.|$|E
2500|$|Eakins {{began the}} first {{painting}} of Addie Williams in late February 1899; his wife Susan Macdowell Eakins recorded {{in her diary}} that work had commenced on February 26. In it Addie is seen in three-quarters profile in a dark blouse, described as [...] "prison-bar black", with a light scarf around her neck, its bow tied at the front <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> Her hair is tightly tied back, and she sits erect and anxious. The portrait is unflinching in its verisimilitude to {{the lines of the}} sitter's face and her subtle frown, and has been seen as representative of [...] "spinsterhood" [...] for its characterization of a fastidious and prim personality. Later Susan Eakins recalled that Addie had been [...] "rather worried" [...] at the time. Eakins continued to work on the painting at least through mid-May of that year. The painting entered the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1939.|$|E

Holland, and Professor Leslie W. Miller (1901), portraits of educators standing as if addressing an audience; {{a portrait of}} Frank Hamilton Cushing (ca. 1895), in which the prominent ethnologist is seen performing an incantation in a Zuñi pueblo; [...] (1897), a brilliant scientist whose study of spectroscopy revolutionized his field; Antiquated Music (1900), in which Mrs. William D. Frishmuth is shown seated amidst her collection of musical instruments; and The Concert Singer (1890–92), for which Eakins asked Weda Cook to sing [...] "O rest in the Lord", {{so that he could}} study the muscles <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>throat</b> and mouth. In order to replicate the proper deployment of a baton, Eakins enlisted an orchestral conductor to pose for the hand seen in the lower left-hand corner of the painting.|$|E

60|$|We took Lucy {{into another}} room, which had by now been prepared, and laid her {{in bed and}} forced a few drops <b>of</b> brandy down <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> I noticed that Van Helsing tied a soft silk {{handkerchief}} round <b>her</b> <b>throat.</b> She was still unconscious, and was quite as bad as, if not worse than, we had ever seen her.|$|R

60|$|Istra.... Card-playing.... Talk of {{socialism}} and art. Mr. Wrenn felt very guilty. Istra.... Smoking and drinking wine....

6000|$|She was wearing, {{when she}} flutteringly {{admitted}} him, a frock of black chiffon cut modestly round {{at the base}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> pretty <b>throat.</b> She seemed to him immensely sophisticated.

50|$|The first death {{occurred}} when a 4-year-old boy had his throat {{cut by the}} kite when he was looking out of the sunroof on the vehicle that he was inside.
