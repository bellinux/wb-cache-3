The recording process was a deliberate exaggeration of the techniques used by the Beatles in the early 1960s, with a four-track representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devices.</b> The guitars can be heard separately on the stereo channels—electric bass on the left channel, rhythm guitar on the right—drums and vocals are mixed {{in the middle of}} the stereo mix. The mixing of the production also used more modern techniques such as overdubbing, a technique used by studios to add a supplementary recorded sound to the material. The band also used a technique known as doubling, where the vocal line used is sung twice.|$|E

5|$|To {{overcome}} {{the constraints of}} the bocage that had made attacks so difficult and costly for both sides, Rhino modifications were made to some M4 Sherman, M5A1 Stuart tanks and M10 tank destroyers, by fitting them with hedge-breaching 'tusks' that could force a path through hedgerows. German tanks remained restricted to the roads but U.S. armored vehicles could maneuver more freely, although the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> was exaggerated. By the eve of Cobra, 60 percent of the tanks of the First Army had the rhino modification. To preserve operational security, Bradley forbade their use until Cobra was launched. In all, 1,269 M4 medium tanks, 694 M5A1 light tanks and 288 M10 tank destroyers were available.|$|E
5|$|Dick Rubin {{handled the}} film's props, {{and set up}} a {{makeshift}} office in the corner of stage 9 throughout production. Rubin's philosophy as property master was that nearly every actor or extra ought to have something in their hands. As such, Rubin devised and fabricated about 350 props for the film, 55 of which were used in the San Francisco tram scene alone. Many of the props were updated designs of items previously seen in the television series, such as phasers and handheld communicators. The only prop that remained from the original television series was Uhura's wireless earpiece, which Nichols specifically requested {{on the first day of}} shooting (and all the production crew save those who had worked on the television show had forgotten about). The new phaser was entirely self-contained, with its own circuitry, batteries, and four blinking lights. The prop came with a hefty $4000 price tag; to save money, the lights were dropped, reducing the size of the phaser by a third. A total of 15 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>devices</b> were made for the film. The communicators were radically altered, as by the 1970s the micro-miniaturization of electronics convinced Roddenberry that the bulky handheld devices of the television series were no longer believable. A wrist-based design was decided upon, with the provision that it look far different from the watch Dick Tracy had been using for decades previous. Two hundred communicators were fashioned, but only a few were the $3500 top models, used for close-ups of the device in action. Most of the props were made from plastic, as Rubin thought that in the future man-made materials would be used almost exclusively.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> vacuum sealing <b>the</b> backside cavity <b>of</b> a Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer (CMUT). The {{presence or absence}} <b>of</b> air inside <b>the</b> cavity has a marked effect upon the system parameters, such as the natural frequency, damping, and the pull-in voltage. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> vacuum inside <b>the</b> cavity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>device</b> causes {{a reduction in the}} effective gap height which leads to a reduction in the pull-in voltage.
