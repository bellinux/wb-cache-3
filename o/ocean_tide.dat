500|$|The National Park Service (NPS) is {{concerned}} about the impact of Bankers on the environmental health of North Carolina's barrier islands. Initially, the NPS believed that the non-native Bankers would completely consume the Spartina alterniflora grasses and the maritime forests, as both were thought to be essential to their survival. [...] Research in 1987 provided information on the horses' diet that suggested otherwise. Half of their diet consisted of Spartina, while only 4% of their nutrients came from the maritime forest. The study concluded that sufficient nutrients were replenished with each <b>ocean</b> <b>tide</b> to prevent a decline in vegetative growth from overgrazing. A 2004 study declared that the greatest impact on plant life was not from grazing but from the damage plants sustained when trampled by the horses' hooves. Bankers pose a threat to ground-nesting animals such as sea turtles and shorebirds. Feral horses interrupt nesting activities and can crush the young.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION The Mertz Glacier in East Antarctica (Fig. 1) with {{a length}} of the {{floating}} part of about 90 kilometers {{is one of the}} largest ice tongues in Antarctica. One interesting feature of such a glacier is the grounding line which is the transition of grounded to floating ice. This transition is associated with a flexure of the ice body to adjust between the vertical motion caused by <b>ocean</b> <b>tides</b> at the free floating tongue and the grounded part which is not moved by <b>ocean</b> <b>tides.</b> This phenomenon can be observed by various techniques, e. g. kinematic GPS [1], tilt measurements [2] and SAR interferometry [3], where the latter gives a unique spatial information. As SAR interferometry reveales the total effect of deformation the vertical motion due to <b>ocean</b> <b>tides</b> is superimposed by horizontal ice flow. This makes it difficult to detect the grounding line of fast flowing glaciers like the Mertz Glacier. We propose a method to use interferograms of adjacent tracks to derive the groundi...|$|R

30|$|A crustal {{deformation}} field observed by GPS usually comes with non-tectonic deformation (Dong et al. 2002), {{especially in the}} vertical direction. And those deformation signals should be discarded when we use the GPS observations to study tectonic deformation. Non-tectonic deformation mainly caused by the effect of tides (solid earth tides, pole <b>tides,</b> and <b>ocean</b> <b>tides)</b> and the earth’s surface mass loading. In the data processing, tide loading (including solid tides, pole <b>tides,</b> and <b>ocean</b> <b>tides)</b> have been corrected. As a result, non-tectonic deformation is mainly contributed by the mass loading on the earth’s surface, such as atmosphere, non-tidal ocean, snow, and soil moisture.|$|R

50|$|In his 1803 {{observations}} of the large tides at Broad Sound in Queensland (up to 11m range) Flinders correctly attributed this to two waves travelling north and south, respectively, and meeting at Broad Sound. He postulated that the dense reef wall further offshore caused the deep <b>ocean</b> <b>tide</b> to bifurcate at the northern southern ends of the reef, travel into shallow shelf waters and meet at Broad Sound. The concept of two meeting waves was used by Taylor in his Irish Sea analysis.|$|E
50|$|Tides are the cyclic {{rising and}} falling of local sea levels caused by the tidal forces of the Moon and the Sun acting on the <b>oceans.</b> <b>Tides</b> cause changes in {{the depth of the}} marine and estuarine water bodies and produce {{oscillating}} currents known as tidal streams.The changing tide produced at a given location {{is the result of the}} changing positions of the Moon and Sun relative to the Earth coupled with the effects of Earth rotation and the local bathymetry.

40|$|Tidal gravity {{observations}} {{have been}} performed across Siberia, along a profile extending from Novosibirsk to the West until Sakhalin Island to the East. All the stations were occupied by the same instrument (LCR 402) for periods ranging from one to more than 2 years. The first goal was to compare the observed tidal parameters of the main tidal waves O 1, K 1 and M 2 with modelled ones computed from nine different <b>ocean</b> <b>tides</b> models: SCW 80, ORI 96, CSR 3, FES 95, FES 02, CSR 4, GOT 00, NAO 99 and TPX 06. In order to assess the overall accuracy of tidal predictions across Siberia, we selected also the best <b>ocean</b> <b>tides</b> models for long period tides, {{on the basis of}} previous comparisons. The observed amplitude factors and phase differences agree with the modelled ones within the associated RMS errors, generally at the level of 0. 3 %. On the other hand, the predicted tidal factors, computed from different <b>ocean</b> <b>tides</b> models, exhibit a high level of consistency (0. 15 %) on the Siberian territory. The tidal load vectors agree within 1 nm s - 2. A mean of the different load vectors will provide the most precise corrections, except {{in the area of the}} Sakhalin Island, where the most recent models fit better the observations. The final conclusion is that gravity tides predictions, based on the mean of the most recent <b>ocean</b> <b>tides</b> models, have a precision of the order of 5 nm s - 2 on the Siberian territory...|$|R
5000|$|During new and [...] full moons, {{when the}} river is {{relatively}} less deep and the <b>ocean</b> <b>tide</b> is high, water flows in from the Atlantic, {{rather than the other}} way around. As river and ocean collide, the Amazon’s flow reverses and a water bulge speeds upstream with incredible force, forming a tidal bore with rumbling noise. The tidal phenomenon is best observed on biannual equinoxes in September and March. On an equinox, when the Moon and Sun fall into alignment with the Earth, their gravitational pull is combined, bringing the Pororoca to its peak.|$|E

These fish would swim {{and out of the}} tide pools on regular intervals, somehow knowing when to swim out before the tidewaters drained from the pools. If for some reason the outlet of the pool were to close off as the tide went out, the fish would quickly swim around the tide pool randomly looking for an alternate escape route.|$|E
