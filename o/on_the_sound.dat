5|$|The {{traditional}} {{names of}} the Latin and Greek letters are usually used for unmodified letters. Letters which are not directly derived from these alphabets, such as , may {{have a variety of}} names, sometimes based on the appearance of the symbol or <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> that it represents. In Unicode, some of the letters of Greek origin have Latin forms for use in IPA; the others use the letters from the Greek section.|$|E
5|$|Other {{vernacular names}} applied include shepherd's {{companion}} (because it accompanied livestock), frogbird, morning bird, and Australian nightingale. Many Aboriginal names are onomatopoeic, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of its scolding call. Djididjidi {{is a name}} from the Kimberley, and Djigirridjdjigirridj {{is used by the}} Gunwinggu of western Arnhem Land. In Central Australia, southwest of Alice Springs, the Pitjantjatjara word is tjintir-tjintir(pa). Among the Kamilaroi, it is thirrithirri. In Bougainville Island, it is called tsiropen in the Banoni language from the west coast, and in Awaipa of Kieta district it is maneka. In the Solomon Islands Pijin it is sometimes called the polis (police) or pris (priest) bird, because of its black-and-white colouring.|$|E

5|$|Star Trek {{garnered}} 32 awards out of 110 nominations, {{with work}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> and special effects highlighted {{by a number}} of award ceremonies they were represented at. Furthermore, the cast including Pine, Quinto and Zoe Saldana were also recognised on an individual basis. The most success received by the film was at the Scream Awards where it took home six awards in a single ceremony out of seventeen nominations. Amongst the nominations received by the film, there were three at the British Academy Film Awards, five at the Critics' Choice Movie Awards, four at the People's Choice Awards, and single nominations at both the Grammy Awards, and the Writers Guild of America Awards. The film was also the first in the Star Trek franchise to win an Academy Award, with Barney Burman, Mindy Hall and Joel Harlow winning for Best Makeup and Hairstyling.|$|E
5|$|The Last of Us {{features}} an original score, composed by musician Gustavo Santaolalla. Known for his minimalist approach to composing, Santaolalla was contacted early in development. Naughty Dog took a similar minimalist approach to {{other elements of}} the game, including the action, sound design and art design. The sound department began working early <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of the Infected, in order to achieve the best work possible. A similar direction was taken by the art department, whose designs influenced other elements of development. Naughty Dog overhauled their game engine for some elements, particularly lighting and animations.|$|E

Juanita explained that the band relied less <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> technology that was prominent in Radio Wars, instead returning to the more organic state of Howling Bells. For the new album, Joel was inspired by prog rock and krautrock acts such as Amon Düül and Aphrodite's Child. Howling Bells were inspired by The Doors documentary When You're Strange, which the members watched just before beginning to record The Loudest Engine.|$|E

5|$|With few exceptions, Hendrix played {{right-handed}} guitars {{that were}} {{turned upside down}} and restrung for left-hand playing. This had an important effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of his guitar; because of the slant of the bridge pickup, his lowest string had a brighter sound while his highest string had a darker sound, which was {{the opposite of the}} Stratocaster's intended design. In addition to Stratocasters, Hendrix also used Fender Jazzmasters, Duosonics, two different Gibson Flying Vs, a Gibson Les Paul, three Gibson SGs, a Gretsch Corvette, and a Fender Jaguar. He used a white Gibson SG Custom for his performances on The Dick Cavett Show in September 1969, and a black Gibson Flying V during the Isle of Wight festival in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Damage was {{heaviest}} in Salter Path, North Carolina {{and along}} the Outer Banks near that community, where (despite being only a Category 1 storm) many buildings suffered significant damage {{as a result of}} the storm surge, which has been described as worse than Hurricane Isabel in 2003 and even compared to Hurricane Hazel in 1954. Nearly all of the significant damage occurred <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> side, or the side facing the mainland. In addition, several piers and many boats were damaged or destroyed by Ophelia's storm surge. Damage was generally lighter on the mainland, and overall structural damage was relatively light, although there was considerable flooding reported in the Wilmington area. Damage was initially estimated to be about $1.6billion, but in final analysis was dropped to only $70million (2005USD; $77.3million 2008USD). On October7, President George W. Bush declared a state of emergency for ten counties in North Carolina as a result of Ophelia.|$|E
5|$|Following Fear and Desire, Kubrick {{began working}} on ideas for a new boxing film. Due to the {{commercial}} failure of his first feature, Kubrick avoided asking for further investments, but commenced a film noir script with Howard O. Sackler. Originally under the title Kiss Me, Kill Me, and then The Nymph and the Maniac, Killer's Kiss (1955) is a 67-minute film noir about a young heavyweight boxer's involvement with a woman being abused by her criminal boss. Like Fear and Desire, it was privately funded by Kubrick's family and friends, with some $40,000 put forward from Bronx pharmacist Morris Bousse. Kubrick began shooting footage in Times Square, and frequently explored during the filming process, experimenting with cinematography and considering the use of unconventional angles and imagery. He initially chose to record the sound on location, but encountered difficulties with shadows from the microphone booms, restricting camera movement. His decision to drop the sound in favor of imagery was a costly one; after 12–14 weeks shooting the picture, he spent some seven months and $35,000 working <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{quantity}} of studio work created {{a conflict between}} Costa's need and desire to support his family, sometimes achieved through working day and night in studios, and his belief in developing his jazz talents, which would have required playing more in clubs {{and dealing with the}} people – agents, club owners, artists and repertoire men, and so on – whose goals seldom matched those of creative musicians. Notable examples of Costa's studio work from this period are being part of Gigi Gryce's final recordings as leader, appearances on Gunther Schuller's Third Stream album Jazz Abstractions, a series of small-group recordings with saxophonist Coleman Hawkins, and two tracks of Shelly Manne's 2-3-4, with Costa featuring on piano for one track and vibes on the other, both with just George Duvivier and Manne. Costa also contributed on vibes to Gryce's music for Fred Baker's short dance film <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sound.</b> A long association with pianist and arranger Ralph Sharon meant that Costa was the vibraphonist in the Sharon orchestra on June 9, 1962, when it played with Bennett at Carnegie Hall. Costa's final recording session was on July 12, 1962, as part of a group assembled by saxophonist Al Cohn mainly from the Benny Goodman band that had toured the Soviet Union earlier that year.|$|E
5|$|West made a {{conscious}} decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was brought on by the alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> of Graduation. Largely due to all this and the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E

25|$|Like marimbas, {{professional}} vibraphones have bars of graduated width.

25|$|There are {{a number}} of whistle {{phenomena}} in which heat plays a role. The temperature in a sound wave varies, but since it is so small normally it is common to neglect its effects.
