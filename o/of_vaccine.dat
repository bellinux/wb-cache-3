5|$|All {{those with}} a risk of {{exposure}} to body fluids such as blood should be vaccinated, if not already. Testing to verify effective immunization is recommended and further doses <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> are given {{to those who are}} not sufficiently immunized. In 10- to 22-year follow-up studies there were no cases of hepatitis B among {{those with a}} normal immune system who were vaccinated. Only rare chronic infections have been documented.|$|E
5|$|OPV {{is usually}} {{provided}} in vials containing 10–20 doses <b>of</b> <b>vaccine.</b> A single dose of {{oral polio vaccine}} (usually two drops) contains 1,000,000 infectious units of Sabin 1 (effective against PV1), 100,000 infectious units of the Sabin 2 strain, and 600,000 infectious units of Sabin 3. The vaccine contains small traces of antibiotics—neomycin and streptomycin—but does not contain preservatives.|$|E
5000|$|Aaby is {{credited}} for {{the discovery of}} non-specific effects <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> - i.e. effects <b>of</b> <b>vaccines,</b> which go beyond the specific protective effects against the targeted diseases. The theory of non-specific effects <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> was established in 1991 and later documented in several trials on measles vaccine, BCG, oral polio vaccine, DTP vaccine and smallpox vaccine. As a consequence of Aaby’s work on non-specific effects <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> it has been recommended the WHO vaccination program in low income countries should be changed. [...] WHO recently reviewed the evidence for non-specific effects <b>of</b> BCG <b>vaccine,</b> measles vaccine and DTP vaccine, and concluded that it would “keep a watch on the evidence of nonspecific effects of vaccination”.|$|R

5|$|SV40 {{was found}} to be present in stocks of the {{injected}} form of the polio vaccine (IPV) in use between 1955 and 1963. It is not found in the OPV form. Over 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine between 1955 and 1963 when a proportion <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> was contaminated with SV40; {{it has been estimated that}} 10–30 million Americans may have received a dose <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> contaminated with SV40. Later analysis suggested that vaccines produced by the former Soviet bloc countries until 1980, and used in the USSR, China, Japan, and several African countries, may have been contaminated; meaning hundreds of millions more may have been exposed to SV40.|$|E
5|$|Black {{takes his}} family to the {{woodland}} cabin, where he and Catherine decide that the dose <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> {{should be given to}} Jordan. Black and Catherine discuss how they would handle infection; Catherine asks to be euthanized, Black states he would wander off to die alone. That night, Catherine wakes up, experiencing symptoms of the disease. She quietly leaves the cabin and walks into the forest. The next morning, Black wakes up, and finding blood on Catherine's pillow, realizes she has gone. He cradles his daughter as the screen flashes images of the collapse of society, interspersed with video noise.|$|E
5|$|To {{encourage}} further discovery, {{researchers and}} policymakers are promoting new economic models <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> development, including prizes, tax incentives, and advance market commitments.

5|$|Due to {{both its}} {{effectiveness}} and safety, in 2009 the World Health Organization {{recommended that the}} rotavirus vaccine be offered to all children globally. Two commercial rotavirus vaccines exist and several more are in development. In Africa and Asia these vaccines reduced severe disease among infants and countries that have put in place national immunization programs have seen {{a decline in the}} rates and severity of disease. This vaccine may also prevent illness in non-vaccinated children by reducing the number of circulating infections. Since 2000, the implementation of a rotavirus vaccination program in the United States has substantially decreased the number of cases of diarrhea by as much as 80 percent. The first dose <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> should be given to infants between 6 and 15 weeks of age. The oral cholera vaccine {{has been found to be}} 50–60% effective over 2years.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} the data showed that while the vaccine {{schedule}} for infants did not exceed FDA, Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), or WHO guidelines on mercury exposure, it could have exceeded Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards {{for the first six}} months of life, depending on the vaccine formulation and the weight of the infant. The review also highlighted difficulty interpreting toxicity of the ethylmercury in thiomersal because guidelines for mercury toxicity were based primarily on studies of methylmercury, a different mercury compound with different toxicologic properties. Multiple meetings were scheduled among various government officials and scientists from multiple agencies to discuss the appropriate response to this evidence. There was a wide range of opinions on the urgency and significance of the safety of thiomersal, with some toxicologists suggesting there was no clear evidence that thiomersal was harmful and other participants like Neal Halsey, director of the Institute <b>of</b> <b>Vaccine</b> Safety at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, strongly advocating removal of thiomersal from vaccines due to possible safety risks. In the process of forming the response to this information, the participants attempted to strike a balance between acknowledging possible harm from thiomersal and the risks involved if childhood vaccinations were delayed or stopped.|$|E
5|$|The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program was {{established}} in 1988 in the United States by {{the passing of the}} National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act, and is funded by a 75-cent tax on each vaccine dose. The program's aims were to maintain a steady supply of vaccines while, at the same time, allowing victims <b>of</b> <b>vaccine</b> injury to be compensated more efficiently than was previously possible. The program operates according to a no-fault principle. The family of Michelle Cedillo sought compensation from this program. Cedillo, a then 12-year-old female wheelchair user from Yuma, Arizona, was involved in the first of three test cases chosen by the government to represent the approximately 4,900 other vaccine-autism cases that had been brought before the court. Michelle Cedillo was born on August 30, 1994, and received thimerosal-containing vaccines during the first fifteen months of her life. On December 20, 1995, she received an MMR vaccine. Theresa and Michael Cedillo filed a vaccine injury claim on behalf of their daughter on December 9, 1998 for encephalopathy, but on January 14, 2002, changed their petition to a causation-in-fact claim, meaning they were arguing that Michelle developed autism {{as a result of the}} combined effects of thimerosal and the MMR vaccine. They did this as a result of a meeting that had taken place the previous year, between Theresa Cedillo and Andrew Wakefield, at a Defeat Autism Now! conference.|$|E

5|$|Vaccination is a {{cheap and}} {{effective}} way of preventing infections by viruses. Vaccines were used to prevent viral infections long before {{the discovery of the}} actual viruses. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in morbidity (illness) and mortality (death) associated with viral infections such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella. Smallpox infections have been eradicated. Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans, and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals. Vaccines can consist of live-attenuated or killed viruses, or viral proteins (antigens). Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, which do not cause the disease but, nonetheless, confer immunity. Such viruses are called attenuated. Live vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with a weak immunity (who are described as immunocompromised), because in these people, the weakened virus can cause the original disease. Biotechnology and genetic engineering techniques are used to produce subunit vaccines. These vaccines use only the capsid proteins of the virus. Hepatitis B vaccine is an example of this type <b>of</b> <b>vaccine.</b> Subunit vaccines are safe for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause the disease. The yellow fever virus vaccine, a live-attenuated strain called 17D, is probably the safest and most effective vaccine ever generated.|$|E

The grade of immunity of thus treated mice was studied {{in respect to}} the sorts <b>of</b> <b>vaccines</b> and the routs of inoculation. Mitani and Tanizawa strains of Rickettsia tsutsugamushi were used as the test agents. The results were as follows: 1) Irrespective of the routes of inoculation and life or death <b>of</b> <b>vaccines,</b> the production <b>of</b> antiboies in mice remained almost independent of the sorts of rickettsial strains. 2) In the case of inoculation <b>of</b> living <b>vaccines,</b> the production <b>of</b> antibodies was the best in those inoculated by intracutaneous route and decreased in the sequence as follows; subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, intracerebral and intratracheal. 3) In the case of inoculation <b>of</b> inactivated <b>vaccines,</b> the inoculation by intraperitoneal route produced the antibodies in the largest amount, and the antibody production decreased in the following order; intracutaneous, subcutaneous, intracerebral and intratracheal.
