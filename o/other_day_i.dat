The reality could be far from what these menus prescribed. Not only was the food insufficient, it was often quite detrimental to health: “The <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> saw, in our kitchens, quarters of refrigerated beef of which the smell and greenish tint were so pronounced that our cooks refused to prepare them. The German head doctor, called to arbitrate, ordered them soaked in a solution of permanganate and, the day after the morrow, this meat, thus disinfected, decorated the ordinary one”.|$|E

It's a— I don't know, {{about the size of the}} first Narwhal that we built. And the fishermen coming in there and fishing are dragging their nets around in that area, and it's just tearing their nets to ribbons— they've even hired a civilian contractor to try to blow the thing up and get it the devil out of there— and has evidently been raising bob with postwar fishing here for more years than I'd care to count.|$|E

She's so warm and {{considerate}} and caring. She's amazingly talented and I've been wearing her clothes forever, so to meet her was like, 'Yay!' [...] bowing down to her; she's dope!" [...] Minaj has also expressed appreciation for Cyndi Lauper's style and how her videos inspired her as a teenager: [...] "When I first went to get my hair colored, I was about 14 and I wanted blonde highlights. The beautician said, 'No, {{you have to get}} your mother on the phone,' and I was just crying and begging. I've always been experimenting. Cyndi Lauper's videos – that's what intrigued me." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{quickly became}} {{apparent}} {{that much of the}} public fascination for Fasanella's work had relied on the political and socio-economic messages they contained rather than their artistic appeal. As those messages fell from favor, Fasanella was abandoned by many of his strongest supporters. As he told one reporter: [...] "The <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> called an old lefty pal at 1199 (the drug and hospital workers' union) and offered them my stuff. 'Forget it Ralph,' he said to me. 'We don't want your stuff.'" ...|$|E

[...] "The <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> had a girl message me saying 'I was ready to take my life and then I heard [...] "Who You Are"'. That pressure is beautiful but scary at the same time.

She wrote the song {{at the end of a}} lonely three-month trip to Los Angeles when she was 20, having been shunted from studio to studio with various producers. [...] "I'm very much someone that lives to be happy. It's not just about the parties and I know so-and-so – I'm not that girl. So I looked in the mirror and started to cry and said 'who am I?'

2500|$|In McManaman's final {{games for}} the club {{in the second half}} of the 1998–99 season, he began turning in mixed performances, with the media accusing him of playing out his final season in a [...] "desultory manner". His form dipped at times, arguably due to a {{combination}} of injuries, being restricted to substitute appearances (as Houllier wanted to cut the side's dependency on his gameplay and replace him), and loss of confidence in certain games where even the home fans turned against him over the contract debacle, with some labelling him a [...] "traitor" [...] and a Judas figure. McManaman told the media after one such game where he became victim of the [...] "boo boys", saying, [...] "That's understandable, when I came off the <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> knew the reaction there was going to be. But I think if they put themselves in the same predicament, and the fact that I have been at Liverpool for 12 years and that I would like to test myself in a foreign country, that's understandable." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{their earlier}} appeals, {{the defense was}} limited to the trial record. The Governor's Committee, however, was not a {{judicial}} proceeding, so Judge Thayer's comments outside the courtroom could be used to demonstrate his bias. Once Thayer told reporters that [...] "No long-haired anarchist from California can run this court!" [...] According to the affidavits of eyewitnesses, Thayer also lectured members of his clubs, calling Sacco and Vanzetti [...] "Bolsheviki!" [...] and saying he would [...] "get them good and proper". During the Dedham trial's first week, Thayer said to reporters: [...] "Did you ever see a case in which so many leaflets and circulars have been spread...saying people couldn't get a fair trial in Massachusetts? You wait till I give my charge to the jury, I'll show them!" [...] In 1924, Thayer confronted a Massachusetts lawyer at Dartmouth, his alma mater, and said: [...] "Did you see what I did with those anarchistic bastards the <b>other</b> <b>day.</b> <b>I</b> guess that will hold them for a while.... Let them go to the Supreme Court now and see what they can get out of them." [...] The Committee knew that, following the verdict, Boston Globe reporter Frank Sibley, who had covered the trial, wrote a protest to the Massachusetts attorney general condemning Thayer's blatant bias. Thayer's behavior both inside the courtroom and outside of it had become a public issue, with the New York World attacking Thayer as [...] "an agitated little man looking for publicity and utterly impervious to the ethical standards one has the right to expect of a man presiding in a capital case." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1907 Alfred Richardson {{received}} an open testimonial from the Mayor of Halifax. It was: [...] "Testimony of His Worship, the Mayor of Halifax, Alderman R. D. Ward. JP as {{to four years}} of Alfred Richardson as Chief Constable of Halifax." [...] 1907 had seen the Women's Suffrage Movement make its presence known in Halifax, mainly by a local resident named Lavina Saltonstall (1881–1957). Saltonstall was born near Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, and moved to live permanently in Haugh Road Halifax in 1906. Saltonstall met the suffragette Christabel Pankhurst who had toured the area, especially around 1905/6. She made speeches in Halifax during the tram strike and agitating for reform for women by writing letters. This then evolved into a local suffragette movement in Halifax, which Alfred Richardson had to monitor with care and tact. In 1908 Saltonstall wrote {{an article in the}} local newspaper, The Halifax Guardian, entitled [...] "Our Police System" [...] a by-product of which was to give an insight into the Halifax Police and Chief Constable Richardson. Part of the article stated: [...] "In order to gather a little information, concerning the work of the Police Force, the <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> paid a visit to the Halifax Borough court. First of all I will mention the fact that a friend of mine had business with the Chief Constable, which fact gave us the chance of getting to his office. Presently we came to an inquiry office where we had to await the Chief's pleasure. Photographs of police groups adorned. Presently we received the intimation that the Chief was disengaged, and we walked into another room sumptuously furnished. The Chief himself had taken refuge behind a table on which were books and pens and inks and flowers. Several movable objects in the form of chairs and rulers and books, and also a fire-screen, were placed near him. An ecclesiastical looking individual in belt and buttons, and with a signet ring and a scholarly stoop, he mounted guard over the door by which we had entered. As in the outer office, photographs etc. and the Chief's overcoat, tall hat, and walking-stick adorned the walls." [...] Comments were made in the local press about how well the local constabulary handled the Suffragette Movement in the town from this time (1908) until its demise in 1916. It seems that the Chief Constable met {{with a certain amount of}} approval by Saltonstall.|$|E

2500|$|Who is {{homosexual}}? My {{answer is}} that a homosexual is somebody who is abnormal because the normal person was created to be attracted to the opposite sex ... to procreate and perpetuate the human race. ... y bishop of North Ankole, Rt. Rev. Muhanguzi ... asked the following question: ... How can God contradict himself by saying in the Book of Genesis that Adam {{should be given a}} wife, Eve, and then also create homosexuals? ... However, now that I have been forced to concentrate my mind on this issue by the actions {{of a small group of}} our MPs led by the Rt. Hon. Kadaga, I can see the fallacy of Bishop Muhanguzi's position. ... Do Albinos create themselves? No. Simply, nature goes wrong in a minority of cases. ... The question at the core of the debate of the homosexuals is: [...] "What do we do with an abnormal person? Do we kill him/her? Do we imprison him/her? Or do we contain him/her?" ... Apart from the people who are born abnormal, it seems there is a larger group of those that become homosexual for mercenary reasons - they get recruited on account of financial inducements. ... How about the women lesbians? Apart from the ones who are born abnormal and the ones that may become lesbian for mercenary reasons, there may be those that go into that practice because of sexual starvation when they fail to get married. Women are normally more [...] than men.... In the past, this imbalance could have been addressed by polygamy. ... The groups that can be rescued ... are those who are homosexual or lesbian for mercenary reasons or on account of ... failure to get legal partners. The rescue for these mercenary deviants is, first and foremost, economic - rapidly industrialize Uganda, modernize agriculture, etc. ... In addition ... we should legislate harshly against those people with money, from within and without, who take advantange of the desperation of our youth to lure them into these abnormal and deviant behaviors. I would support a life sentence.... On this one I would agree with the Bill passed by Parliament. The unanswered question, however, is: What do you do with the really abnormal people? ... Only the <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> saw on television that Dr. Allan Turing, the genius mathematician that cracked the German Enigma code for the anti-Hitler alliance ... was a homosexual. This man ... enabled them to win the war. Yet, the British chemically castrated him in 1952, where-upon he committed suicide, apparently. Were the British correct in handling that issue like that? The British no longer think so. Only the other day, the Queen had to apologize to this ... person ... much more useful to society than the millions of sexually normal people. ... he challenge is how to correctly handle the sexually abnormal on the one hand and those who use money or any other influence to recruit sexually normal people into this abnormal and disgusting behaviour. When we meet in the NRM caucus, we shall, I am sure, find a scientifically correct position.|$|E
