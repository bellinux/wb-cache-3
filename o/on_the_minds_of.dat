She also emphasized the negative implications <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> women and children. Written in a confessional and autobiographical style that was highly critical of southern moderates, it met with something of a cruel silence from book critics and the literary community.|$|E

Mansa Musa's hajj devalued gold in Mamluk Egypt for a decade. He made a great {{impression}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the Muslim and European world. He invited scholars and architects like Ishal al-Tuedjin (al-Sahili) to further integrate Mali into the Islamic world.|$|E
25|$|In 1910, {{he issued}} the decree Quam Singulari, which changed {{the age at}} which communion could be {{received}} from 12 to 7 years old, the age of discretion. The pope lowered the age because he wished to impress the event <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> children and stimulate their parents to new religious observance; this decree was found unwelcome in some places due to the belief that parents would withdraw their children early from Catholic schools, now that First Communion was carried out earlier.|$|E

Although nothing much is left of the wall paintings, evidence of their pictorial art is found in Bibles and Psalters, in illuminated manuscripts. The poem, 'The Dream of the Rood', is an example how symbolism of trees was fused into Christian symbolism.|$|E

Since its introduction in 1935 the medium priced Packard One-Twenty had consistently outsold the LaSalle, with sales volume exceeding Cadillac's counterpart by an average of 72 percent over the six-year period 1935-40 inclusively. Since LaSalle had been a Cadillac in all but name for most of its lifespan, it was {{decided it was time to}} bestow upon it the prestigious title of Cadillac.|$|E
25|$|Brian Statham was fit again and, {{despite his}} good {{performance}} at Lord's, Coldwell {{had to give}} way. England also recalled John Murray, replacing Geoff Millman as the keeper, and preferred Fred Titmus to Tony Lock who was expensive during the Burki-Nasim stand at Lord's. Pakistan, whose injury problems were beginning to mount up, made three changes because Imtiaz, Wallis Mathias and D'Souza could not play. Their replacements were Butt, who had played at Edgbaston but not at Lord's, fast-medium bowler Munir Malik and off-spinner Javed Akhtar who had literally just arrived from Pakistan, having been called up as a reinforcement. With the winter tour still more <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the England selectors than anything else, they decided to let Cowdrey captain the team in this match. Javed Burki captained Pakistan as in the two previous Tests.|$|E
25|$|Lyon {{suffered}} {{their third}} {{defeat of the}} season the following week against relegation strugglers Nantes. Lyon came into the match apparently looking ahead to their Champions League clash with Bayern Munich and proceeded to underestimate the West Coast side, who defeated Lyon 1–2 with two goals from the Croat Ivan Klasnić. The loss was promptly followed by a showdown for first place with rivals Marseille the following week. Other than battling for first place, the return of Hatem Ben Arfa to the Stade Gerland was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> supporters, {{as well as the}} players. However, despite the hype and build-up leading up to the match, including achieving a record television audience, both clubs failed to score a goal as the match ended in another 0–0 draw. Lyon finally ended their winless run with a 1–0 victory over Caen with Benzema scoring Lyon's lone goal, his tenth of the league campaign. With the victory, Lyon were assured first place heading into the three-week winter break.|$|E

500|$|With all his {{frequently}} noted {{attention to}} character and characters—Hazlitt's partly psychological approach to character necessarily referred to observed real-life behavior—he also frequently emphasises the art by which Shakespeare created dramatic [...] "character". Particularly in tragedy, a [...] "sense of power", he believed, {{is the essential}} medium by which a poet of genius operates <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> his audience. When the author instills in the reader or viewer's imagination the sense of power {{that he must have}} had in grasping and conveying intertwined passions, he makes us identify with a character such as Othello, and feel in ourselves the way Iago plays upon his mind so that, ironically, his weakness is made to undermine his strength.|$|E
500|$|A real-life {{journalist}} named Reid, who Gray {{interviewed for}} his book, states that [...] "Girly Edition" [...] mirrors well how some journalists actually work.

I mean, people really do stories like that."

500|$|Anton Kaes, {{who called}} Caligari [...] "an {{aggressive}} statement about war psychiatry, murder and deception", wrote that Alan's question to Cesare, [...] "How long have I to live?"

Francis's despair after Alan's murder can likewise be {{compared to that of}} the many soldiers who survived the war but saw their friends die on the battlefield. Kaes noted other parallels between the film and war experiences, noting that Cesare attacked Alan at dawn, a common time for attacks during the war. Thomas Elsaesser called Caligari an [...] "outstanding example of how [...] "fantastic" [...] representations in German films from the early 1920s seem to bear the imprint of pressures from external events, to which they refer only through the violence with which they disguise and disfigure them." ...|$|E

[...] Sauriol commented that the time leap of a year was a [...] "gutsy move," [...] but felt it has [...] "always been the case" [...] for the series. However, he also felt that all doubts the audience might have to harbor [...] "that this show won't live up to the first two seasons should be wiped away."

500|$|During {{the late}} 19th century, the {{prevailing}} {{view in the}} Restoration Movement was that the Holy Spirit currently acts only through the influence of inspired scripture. [...] This rationalist view was associated with Alexander Campbell, who was [...] "greatly affected by what he viewed as {{the excesses of the}} emotional camp meetings and revivals of his day". [...] He believed that the Spirit draws people towards salvation but understood the Spirit to do this [...] "in the same way any person moves another—by persuasion with words and ideas". This view came to prevail over that of Barton W. Stone, who believed the Spirit had a more direct role {{in the life of the}} Christian. [...] Since the early 20th century, many, but not all, among the Churches of Christ have moved away from this [...] "word-only" [...] theory of the operation of the Holy Spirit. [...] As one scholar of the movement puts it, [...] "or better or worse, those who champion the so-called word-only theory no longer have a hold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the constituency of Churches of Christ. Though relatively few have adopted outright charismatic and third wave views and remained in the body, apparently the spiritual waves have begun to erode that rational rock." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{deficiencies}} of the PAVN's armored and heavy artillery forces, essential for attacks on heavily fortified ARVN regimental and divisional base camps, weighed heavily <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>minds</b> <b>of</b> the General Staff planners who drew up the plan {{presented to the}} Politburo in October 1974. Much attention {{was focused on the}} role ARVN's ammunition shortages played in the collapse of South Vietnam, but it is not known if the PAVN suffered similar shortages. Soviet and Chinese military aid, especially in the category of [...] "offensive weapon" [...] (armor and artillery), declined significantly since the Paris cease-fire. Also, much of PAVN's armor and artillery was in poor condition, and spare parts were in short supply. Most PAVN artillery units, especially in the South, were still equipped only with light mortar, recoilless gun, or single-tube rocket launchers. In the COSVN (Central Office for South Vietnam) area of operations, consisting of the southern half of the country, seven infantry divisions (the 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th) and one corps headquarters (4th Corps) were supported by only five battalions of field artillery, two of which were equipped with captured US-made weapons for which there was little ammunition, and three understrength armored battalions. The PAVN's 2d Corps, with three artillery regiments belonging to its three infantry divisions, a corps artillery brigade, a tank brigade, and a separate armored battalion, could field a grand total of only 89 tanks and armored personnel carrier and 87 towed artillery pieces when it set off to attack Saigon in April 1975.|$|E
