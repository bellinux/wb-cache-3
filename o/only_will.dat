5|$|The Privy Council {{identified}} one of {{the extreme}} circumstances as that which occurred in Wright & Advertiser Newspapers Limited v. Lewis (1990). In this case, the Supreme Court of South Australia held that an action may proceed against a legislator accused of libel where the whole {{subject matter of the}} alleged libel relates to the legislator's conduct in the legislature so that the effect of parliamentary privilege is to exclude virtually all the evidence necessary to justify the libel. If such an action is not allowed to proceed, not <b>only</b> <b>will</b> there be injustice to the defendant, but there will also be a real danger that the media will be forced to abstain from the truthful disclosure of the legislator's misbehaviour in Parliament. This would be a most serious inroad into freedom of speech since justification would be impossible.|$|E
5|$|Throughout a {{great and}} open area, not <b>only</b> <b>will</b> there be a greater chance of {{favourable}} variations, arising from {{the large number of}} individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role in the changing history of the organic world.|$|E

25|$|Reconciliation ecologists believe {{increasing}} biodiversity within human dominated landscapes {{will help}} to save global biodiversity. This is sometimes preferable to traditional conservation {{because it does not}} impair human use of the landscape and therefore may be more acceptable to stakeholders. However, not <b>only</b> <b>will</b> it encourage biodiversity in the areas where it takes place, but many scholars cite other benefits of including biodiversity in human landscapes on both global conservation activities and human well-being.|$|E

Harris claimed Bush would campaign with her sometime in the two months before the election, but the governor's office denied this.|$|E

25|$|Saliva, that is {{placing the}} tooth under the {{accident}} victim’s tongue {{or in the}} cheek, has been recommended. Saliva, as a storage media, causes twice damage as water. Its osmolality is very low, causing bursting of the tooth root cells, but additionally, because saliva is filled with its normal flora of microorganisms, it will severely infect the tooth root cells. When the tooth is replanted, not <b>only</b> <b>will</b> the cells be necrotic but they will also infect the bone socket.|$|E
25|$|If {{the claim}} is {{accepted}} then the maximum Oyster fare minus {{the cost of the}} journey will be refunded. The user will be asked to nominate and make a journey from a specific Tube, DLR, London Overground or National Rail station, or Tram stop. On touching in or out, the refund is loaded to the card. The only way to collect a refund is as part of an actual journey, otherwise a further penalty fare is charged. This is because when the passenger touches the reader with their Oyster card, not <b>only</b> <b>will</b> the refund go on to the card, but a new journey will start.|$|E
25|$|In {{tropical}} forests, gorillas are hunted {{to provide}} meat for the bushmeat trade. Logging also destroys gorilla habitats. Although logging diminishes gorilla habitats, {{it may also}} provide for increased herbaceous vegetation {{as a result of}} gaps in the tree cover. Destruction of gorilla habitat may harm the overall forest ecosystem. Western lowland gorillas are seed dispersers, which mean they carry seeds from one place to another, and this trait is beneficial to many of the animals in the forest. Therefore, if there are no western lowland gorillas to disperse the needed seeds to other animals, not <b>only</b> <b>will</b> the gorillas become extinct but so will many other animals, which could over time destroy an entire ecosystem.|$|E

25|$|With the {{subsidies}} reform plan implemented, many experts {{are hopeful that}} not <b>only</b> <b>will</b> government intervention and price distortions in agricultural products be reduced, but also that a fundamental restructuring {{will take place in}} the agriculture sector. The government has recently quadrupled bread prices as part of the plan and is planning to liberalise the market completely. In addition, the pricing of a number of other products that was previously done by the government is now to be left to the market mechanism. More importantly, fuel, water and electricity prices have increased significantly. The government has still kept prices lowest for agriculture in comparison to household and industrial consumers. Nonetheless, the high level of inefficiency in the agricultural sector from irrigation to harvesting, is expected to be fundamentally reformed and replaced with more efficient and modern technologies.|$|E
25|$|Forward secrecy is a {{property}} of cryptographic systems which ensures that a session key {{derived from a}} set {{of public and private}} keys will not be compromised if one of the private keys is compromised in the future. Without forward secrecy, if the server's private key is compromised, not <b>only</b> <b>will</b> all future TLS-encrypted sessions using that server certificate be compromised, but also any past sessions that used it as well (provided of course that these past sessions were intercepted and stored at the time of transmission). An implementation of TLS can provide forward secrecy by requiring the use of ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish session keys, and some notable TLS implementations do so exclusively: e.g., Gmail and other Google HTTPS services that use OpenSSL. However, many clients and servers supporting TLS (including browsers and web servers) are not configured to implement such restrictions. In practice, unless a web service uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange to implement forward secrecy, all of the encrypted web traffic to and from that service can be decrypted by a third party if it obtains the server's master (private) key; e.g., by means of a court order.|$|E
25|$|With {{the aim of}} {{protecting}} models and projecting a healthier body image, Spain, Italy, Brazil, and Israel, “passed bills that prohibit models from working with a Body Mass Index (BMI) below 18.5”. The UK and U.S., chose to use less compelling tactics of cultivating the general public through the promotion of education campaigns in society. France on the other hand, introduced a new regulation this year preventing the employment of extremely skinny models, {{and the need for}} a medical certificate to verify their health. This was an update to the previous law passed that prohibited agencies from using models with a BMI lower than 18. France is also working on ensuring retailers specify airbrushed images in magazines, websites, and advertisements. However, some argue that these laws may not be effective as, majority of individuals are already aware of digital retouching techniques, and may even use it themselves. Due to the criticisms surrounding the glamourising of eating disorders, brands are actively playing their part in cultivating better body images too. Fashion conglomerates; Kering and LVMH, recently “announced that they will no longer hire models smaller than a U.S. size 2”. Not <b>only</b> <b>will</b> this improve the working conditions of models, both companies hope it may inspire others to follow suit. Although, the industry is moving in the right direction, it is arguable that the banning of size zero could be seen as a discriminatory act; similar to thin shaming. For that reasons, focus should be placed on altering beauty norms, rather than blame the wearer for their size. Moreover, the announcement of a small and minimum dress size, which does not fit the average body type of most countries, continues to “send the message that super slim body types is the ‘ideal’”.|$|E
