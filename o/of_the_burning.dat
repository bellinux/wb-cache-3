5|$|During the present, the man apologizes to {{his lover}} {{and they are}} reconciled. In another flashback, he attacks someone who plays pool with his lover. Eminem joins Rihanna in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> house for the final verse. Meanwhile, after the flashback, the woman comes home and locks herself in the {{bathroom}} to stop her abusive lover from entering. In another scene, the fire on her palms vanishes as she clasps her hands. Flames later engulf Eminem and the couple, who are then shown fighting in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> house. In the end, the couple stays together and the video returns to their first scene, in which they sleep.|$|E
5|$|On 6 October 1984, {{the fourth}} unit, headed by special effects {{supervisor}} John Richardson, began its {{work on the}} climactic fight sequence. At first, only a few plates constructed to resemble the Golden Gate Bridge were used. Later that night, shooting <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> San Francisco City Hall commenced. The first actual scenes atop the bridge were filmed on 7 October 1984.|$|E
5|$|The money took {{well over}} an hour to burn as Drummond and Cauty fed £50 notes into the fire. According to Drummond, only about £900,000 of the money was {{actually}} burnt, with the remainder flying straight up the chimney. Two days later, according to Reid, Jimmy Cauty destroyed all film and photographic evidence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning.</b> Ten months later, Gimpo revealed to them that he had secretly kept a copy.|$|E

40|$|Cigarette-burning and the smoke-formation {{processes}} and smoke composition are important topics for understanding cigarette performance. This paper proposes the molecular formulas representing <b>the</b> active components <b>of</b> bright, burley, and Oriental tobaccos and a basic chemistry model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cigarette <b>burning</b> processes. Previous knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cigarette <b>burning</b> {{processes and}} smoke formation helped to establish parameters in deriving the basic chemistry equations. The proposed chemistry provides a brief view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cigarette <b>burning</b> during puffing and interpuff smoldering, {{and can be}} used to interpret and predict the smoke composition for cigarettes made from bright, burley, and Oriental tobaccos. Based on the proposed chemistry, <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> ventilation on smoke component deliveries is discussed and <b>the</b> reaction heat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> puffing process is estimated...|$|R

5|$|Eldest begins {{following}} {{several important}} events in Eragon. The {{story is the}} continued adventures of Eragon and his dragon Saphira, centering on their journey {{to the realm of}} the Elves in order to further Eragon's training as a Dragon Rider. Other plots in the story focus on Roran, Eragon's cousin, who leads the inhabitants of Carvahall to Surda to join the Varden, and Nasuada as she takes on her father's role as leader of the Varden. Eldest ends at the Battle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Burning</b> Plains, where Eragon faces a new Dragon Rider, Murtagh, and a new dragon, Thorn.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, Roddenberry began flying for Pan American World Airways, {{including}} routes from New York to Johannesburg or Calcutta, the two longest Pan Am routes at the time. Listed as {{a resident}} of River Edge, New Jersey, he experienced his third crash while on the Clipper Eclipse on June 18, 1947. The plane landed in the Syrian desert, and Roddenberry dragged injured passengers out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> plane and led the group to get help. Fourteen {{people died in the}} crash; 11 passengers needed hospital treatment, and eight were unharmed. He resigned from Pan Am on May 15, 1948, and decided to pursue his dream of writing, particularly for the new medium of television.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} is a fire hazard, {{especially if}} the material is finely divided. In a moist environment, plutonium forms hydrides on its surface, which are pyrophoric and may ignite in air at room temperature. Plutonium expands up to 70% in volume as it oxidizes and thus may break its container. The radioactivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> material is an additional hazard. Magnesium oxide sand {{is probably the most}} effective material for extinguishing a plutonium fire. It cools the burning material, acting as a heat sink, and also blocks off oxygen. Special precautions are necessary to store or handle plutonium in any form; generally a dry inert gas atmosphere is required.|$|E

5|$|The {{incineration}} {{was recorded}} on a Hi-8 video camera by K Foundation collaborator Gimpo. In August 1995, the film—Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid—was toured around the UK, with Drummond and Cauty engaging each audience in {{debate about the}} burning and its meaning. In November 1995, the duo pledged to dissolve the K Foundation and to refrain from public discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> {{for a period of}} 23 years, but Drummond spoke about the burning in 2000 and 2004. Initially, he was unrepentant, but in 2004 he admitted to the BBC that he regretted burning the money.|$|E
5|$|By 17:10, Thetis and Blonde {{began to}} {{withdraw}} from the bay as the fire took hold of the first frigate. The rest of the British squadron, despite heavy cannon fire from a fort on shore, successfully landed their troops and stormed and captured the defences. There were heavy casualties in the storming parties, including Hugh Cameron, captain of Hazard, who was killed by grapeshot. At 17:20, the fire reached the magazines <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> flûte, and the ensuing explosion hurled burning wreckage across the bay. The British ships were largely untouched, but the second French flûte was struck by a large piece of flaming timber, which ignited her mainmast and destroyed her as well. The operations successfully completed, the British ships embarked their landing parties, who had demolished the fortifications around the bay, and returned to open water.|$|E
5|$|In the Ramayana, Sita has {{few other}} rakshasi benefactors besides Trijata. When Hanuman – the monkey-general of Rama who was tasked to find Sita – meets her in Lanka, {{she tells him}} that the wife of Vibhishana (the brother of Ravana who sides with Rama in the war) sent her {{daughter}} Kala (in other recensions of the Ramayana, known as Nanda or Anala) to proclaim Ravana's intention to not surrender Sita to Rama, despite {{the advice of the}} wise minister Avindhya and Vibhisana. Another friend, Sarama, consoles Sita when Ravana shows Sita an illusory severed head of Rama. She also informs her of Rama's well-being and his entry in Lanka with his army. In some versions of the Ramayana, an interpolated canto mentions how Sarama also tells Sita <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> of Lanka by Hanuman after his meeting with Sita. Ravana's wife Mandodari is described to have rescued Sita in some versions, when Ravana tries to kill Sita. In later Rama-centric literature, Sarama was identified as Vibishana's wife, while Trijata was regarded as his daughter.|$|E

5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses her forehead and leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> crosses, and then everybody involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E
5|$|The Bal des Ardents (Ball <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Burning</b> Men) or Bal des Sauvages (Ball of the Wild Men) was a {{masquerade}} ball held on 28January 1393 in Paris {{at which}} Charles VI of France {{performed in a}} dance with {{five members of the}} French nobility. Four of the dancers were killed in a fire caused by a torch brought in by a spectator, Charles's brother Louis, Duke of Orléans. Charles and another of the dancers survived. The ball was {{one of a number of}} events intended to entertain the young king, who the previous summer had suffered an attack of insanity. The event undermined confidence in Charles's capacity to rule; Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility. The public's outrage forced the King and his brother Orléans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted regicide and sorcery, to offer penance for the event.|$|E
5|$|The sight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> wrecks in {{the night}} once again spread panic {{throughout}} the French fleet, the grounded ships opening a heavy fire on the scuttled ships in the assumption that they were fireships. Captain Lacaille of Tourville was so unnerved that he immediately ordered his crew to abandon ship {{and set it on}} fire. The evacuation was so hasty however that the fires did not spread effectively, and the following morning the ship was found to still be intact, the crew returning to their prematurely abandoned vessel. There they found that the ship's quartermaster Eugéne-Joseph-Romain Bourgeois had remained aboard, unconvinced by Lacaille's order, and had single-handedly driven off an attempt by a British boat to board and capture the ship. During the night about 30 sailors had joined him, keeping Touville in French hands until dawn came {{and the rest of the}} crew returned.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{passed through}} the area still {{occupied}} by the damaged and sinking U.S. destroyers and fired on Ayanami with her secondary batteries, setting her afire. Following close behind, South Dakota suddenly suffered a series of electrical failures, reportedly during repairs when her chief engineer locked down a circuit breaker in violation of safety procedures, causing her circuits repeatedly to go into series, making her radar, radios, and most of her gun batteries inoperable. However, she continued to follow Washington towards {{the western side of}} Savo Island until 23:35, when Washington changed course left to pass to the southward behind the burning destroyers. South Dakota tried to follow but had to turn to right to avoid Benham, which resulted in the ship's being silhouetted by the fires <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> destroyers and made her a closer and easier target for the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli and Sitriuc spent Yule with Sigurðr in Orkney, where Sitriuc {{convinced}} Sigurðr to ally {{himself against}} Brian {{on the condition}} that Sigurðr would gain Gormlaith in marriage. In April 1014, the opposing forces met and clashed at the remarkably bloody Battle of Clontarf. Although Brian's forces ultimately won the day, and Sigurðr himself was amongst the slain, Brian lost his life as well. As for Gilli, he appears in a chapter of Njáls saga that presents a series of supernatural events connected with the conflict. In one instance, a Caithnessman is said to have witnessed valkyrie-like apparitions singing songs for the slain, whilst a similar event is said to have occurred in the Faroe Islands. Priests in Iceland are stated to have encountered paranormal phenomena, whilst an Orcadian is said to have encountered the spectre of Sigurðr before disappearing {{off the face of the}} earth. As for Gilli, the saga asserts that he dreamt of a song that foretold the outcome of the battle and the fall of Brian and Sigurðr. There is reason to suspect that the aforesaid supernatural manifestationsarguably somewhat detached from the saga's general narrativeare actually interpolations of separate material. Elsewhere in the narrative, however, there are examples of paranormal phenomena intervening into human affairs. For example, the episode concerning Gilli's dream seems to directly parallel an earlier episode in which another man, the Icelander Flosi Þórðarson, is depicted dreaming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> of the saga's eponym, Njáll Þorgeirsson.|$|E
5|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the video features Jay Z as a passenger in a car speeding along Mission Road in Los Angeles, where he encounters Beyoncé, {{standing in the middle}} of the road, at the Fourth Street bridge. Beyoncé performs in various dance sequences, beginning with her wearing a white tank top, denim blue shorts, and red high-heels. She performs an elaborate solo dance on a riser. The scene shifts to a gold set with a mock photo shoot, before moving into a scene with dancers detailing Beyoncé and dancing against a wall while wearing caps and full length pants. Jay Z appears and ignites a line of petrol leading to a car parked under the bridge, which explodes in flames. Jay Z performs his rap in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burning</b> car, and Beyoncé dances beside him, wearing an exotic silk print over a fur coat, before kicking the valve off a fire hydrant. She continues to dance while the water is flying everywhere. The video ends with Beyoncé and her dancers wearing vibrant Versace dresses in front of a large fan. Their outfits contrast with the neutral colors of the background, the video. Carmit Bachar, a former Pussycat Dolls singer, is one of the dancers.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> {{recovery}} <b>of</b> vanadium {{from heavy}} oil fly ash having a high carbon content was performed using a four-step process {{consisting of a}} preliminary burning {{in order to reduce}} the carbonaceous fraction, followed by an acid leaching and an oxidative precipitation <b>of</b> vanadium pentoxide. <b>The</b> preliminary <b>burning</b> was conducted in the temperature range 650 to 1150 °C, below the initial deformation temperature (IDT) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fly ash. <b>The</b> temperature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preliminary <b>burning</b> step was revealed to be a significant parameter. Above 950 °C various phenomena (fusion, volatilisation of V, formation of V-Ni refractory compounds) occurred that adversely affected <b>the</b> recovery <b>of</b> vanadium. <b>The</b> <b>burning</b> temperature <b>of</b> 850 °C was found to be the best as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trade-off between the overall vanadium recovery yield (83 %) and the V 2 O 5 weight percentage in the precipitate (84. 8 %) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Prescribed burning {{programs}} have evolved with little concern for <b>the</b> visual impact <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> and <b>the</b> potential prescribed <b>burning</b> can have {{in managing the}} forest scene.

This paper evaluates <b>the</b> visual impacts <b>of</b> <b>burning</b> and <b>of</b> not <b>burning</b> in <b>the</b> giant sequoia-mixed conifer forest type. Alternatives to current techniques are suggested which will reduce the negative visual impacts and incorporate scene management as a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prescribed <b>burning</b> program. <b>The</b> {{need for a new}} awareness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> visual impacts <b>of</b> prescribed burning is discussed...|$|R
