40|$|Antigens {{administered}} via {{the oral}} and, {{to a lesser}} extent, the nasal route are potentially able to invoke tolerance, resulting in a nonreactive immune response. This has been a hurdle for mucosal vaccine development and yet the desire to induce protective local and systemic responses, with pain-free and more convenient products, has been the impetus driving mucosal vaccine R&D. Nevertheless, few mucosal vaccines have reached the marketplace and products are still treated with caution, particularly where live organisms are utilized. In this review, we examine the use of delivery systems with adjuvant properties as key components in a vaccine strategy that {{does not require the}} use of live vectors to overcome tolerance and have exemplified their success in mucosal vaccines, concentrating on the nasal and <b>oral</b> <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration...</b>|$|R

The inducement of conjunctivitis in guinea pigs and lethality in gerbils after intraperitoneal administration was restricted to a few serotypes of Y. enterocolitica. Human strains of serotype O: 8 were the most virulent, whereas strains of the common human serotype O: 3 and most others were essentially avirulent. One virulent strain of serotype O: 8 produced fatal infections within 7 days in four of five gerbils receiving 100 cells intraperitoneally.

The same potentiation of anti-Candida activity was observed whether the lower dose of drug was encapsulated in multilamellar vesicles, mixed with multilamellar vesicles, or given either 1 h before or 1 h after multilamellar vesicles. It was postulated that the mechanism of action involved the retention of the liposomes by organs of the reticuloendothelial system, resulting in an enhanced response of the macrophages to the immunostimulating activity of the N-acetylmuramyl-L-alpha-aminobutyryl-D-isoglutamine given {{in conjunction with the}} vesicles...|$|R
40|$|Background: Intranasal {{and oral}} antihistamines are {{effective}} in treating allergic rhinitis. Studies comparing these <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> an antihistamine regarding efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile are lacking. Objective: To compare topical and <b>oral</b> <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> <b>of</b> cetirizine regarding efficacy, plasma exudation, and systemic drug levels in a repeated allergen challenge model of allergic rhinitis. Methods: Oral cetirizine dihydrochloride, 10 mg once daily, and topical cetirizine dinitrate in a dose corresponding to 4. 4 mg of the dihydrochloride salt twice daily were given to grass pollen-sensitive individuals for 12 days in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Timothy grass pollen allergen challenges were given once daily for 7 days using a nasal spray device. Nasal symptoms and peak inspiratory flow were recorded in the morning, 10 minutes after allergen challenge, and in the evening. The pharmacokinetics of the treatments was monitored in 8 patients. The remaining 28 patients were challenged topically with histamine 12 and 24 hours after the final topical and oral cetirizine doses, respectively. Nasal lavage levels of alpha(2) -macroglobulin were determined to evaluate histamine-induced mucosal plasma exudation. Results: During the last 3 days of the repeated allergen challenge model, chronic symptoms were established. Both treatments reduced symptoms 10 minutes after allergen challenge (P <. 001 vs placebo). Neither treatment reduced morning and evening symptoms or nasal peak inspiratory flow. Topical, but not oral, cetirizine reduced histamine-induced plasma exudation (P <. 01 vs placebo) when systemic drug levels were similar in the 2 treatment regimens. Conclusions: Topical and oral cetirizine reduced acute nasal symptoms produced by allergen challenges in patients with established chronic symptoms. There were also antihistaminic effects of topical cetirizine not related to systemic drug levels...|$|R

Novel drugs that efficiently combat glioblastomas are therefore of great interest. We report here that JLK 1486, an 8 -hydroxyquinoline-substituted benzylamine, could represent a novel chemical scaffold to reach this goal.

The authors examined the ability of this compound (CSPG-DS) to protect retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) from death caused by elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). METHODS. With the use of chronic and acute models of elevated IOP, the authors {{examined the effects of}} CSPG-DS on RGC survival in adult (� 2 months old), aged (10 – 12 months old), and immunocompromised Lewis rats. Systemic, topical, and <b>oral</b> <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration</b> were examined. RESULTS. CSPG-DS protected RGCs from IOP-induced death. Treatment was effective in all three examined rat populations (normal adult, aged, and immunocompromised rats) and with all <b>routes</b> <b>of</b> <b>administration,</b> possibly in part through its control of microglial activity. CONCLUSIONS. Results point to the therapeutic potential of CSPG-DS for glaucoma, particularly in elderly populations for whom disease prevalence is high. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2007; 48 : 1181 – 1190) DOI: 10. 1167 /iovs. 05 - 1213 Glaucoma is characterized by slow, progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), causing gradual visual field loss and eventually leading to blindness. The primary cause of the disease is not yet known, and the factors contributing to its progression have not been fully characterized. Current treatment of patients with glaucoma is mostly limited to the reduction of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), known {{to be one of the}} major factors responsible for disease progression. 1 It is clear, however, that although a decrease in IOP can significantly reduce the loss of neurons, it does not necessarily halt the process of degeneration. 2 – 8 It was suggested by our group that the ongoing loss of neurons in glaucoma might be explained, at least in part, by secondary factors that emerge from injured tissue as a result o...|$|R
