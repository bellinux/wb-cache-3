5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} {{the investigation and}} confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases utilized camera angles seen in horror films, which allowed enemies to lurk {{in areas that are}} concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> uncertainty.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> agitation.|$|E

5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits <b>of</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E

40|$|Background: Traumatic {{injury and}} mental health {{disorders}} are co-associated. Early identification <b>of</b> depression, <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> stress following injury, and subsequent preventive intervention, may reduce the long-term symptoms and negative impacts associated with depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> The purpose <b>of</b> {{the study was to}} determine the incidence, severity <b>and</b> predictors <b>of</b> depression, <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> stress in injured patients in the acute phase of care, and at six months following injury, as well as the effectiveness of an in-hospital screening tool. Methods: This descriptive longitudinal study of trauma patients was conducted at a Level 1 Metropolitan Trauma Centre in Australia over 14 months. Participants were interviewed using the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale short-form version (DASS- 21) during hospital admission then at 3 and 6 months after injury. Descriptive statistics were performed to evaluate participant characteristics <b>and</b> incidence <b>of</b> depression, <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> stress. Correlations and logistic regression were conducted to investigate the ability of the DASS- 21 to predict symptoms <b>of</b> depression, <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> stress and to investigate factors associated with depression, <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> stress 6 months after injury. Results: 201 participants ranging in age (18 – 94 years) and injury severity participated in the baseline interview and 109 completed all 3 interviews over 6 months. Over half (54 %) reported above normal scores for depression, anxiety and/or stress in at least one of the 3 time points. Intensive care unit admission and high levels <b>of</b> depression, <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> stress at 3 months post injury were predictors for high levels <b>of</b> depression, <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> stress at 6 months. Low scores for depression, <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> stress during admission were correlated with low scores for depression, <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> stress at 3 and 6 months. Conclusion: Depression, <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> stress in patients hospitalised following injury is common and should be anticipated in patients who have had an intensive care admission. Screening at 3 months following injury identifies patients at risk of long-term symptoms <b>of</b> depression, <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> stress...|$|R

Methods: Two-year {{longitudinal study of}} 20, 036 adults aged 60 + years. We used the Patient Health Questionnaire <b>and</b> the Hospital <b>Anxiety</b> <b>and</b> Depression Scale <b>anxiety</b> subscale to establish the presence <b>of</b> depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety,</b> <b>and</b> standard procedures to collect demographic, lifestyle, psychosocial, and clinical data. Results: The prevalence <b>of</b> <b>anxiety,</b> depression, <b>and</b> DA was 4. 7 %, 1. 4 %, and 1. 8 %. About 57 % of depression cases showed evidence <b>of</b> comorbid <b>anxiety,</b> while only 28 % of those with clinically significant anxiety had concurrent depression. There was not only an overlap {{in the distribution of}} risk factors in these diagnostic groups but also differences. We found that 31 %, 23 %, and 35 % of older adults with <b>anxiety,</b> depression, <b>and</b> DA showed persistence of symptoms after two years. Repeated anxiety was more common in women and repeated depression in men. Socioeconomic stressors were common in repeated DA. Conclusions: Clinically significant <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> depression are distinct conditions that frequently coexist in later life; when they appear together, older adults endure a more chronic course of illness.
