5|$|Manning's {{books have}} {{received}} limited critical attention; as during her life, opinions are divided, particularly about her characterisation and portrayal of other cultures. Her works tend to minimise issues of gender, {{and are not}} easily classified as feminist literature. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has highlighted Manning's importance as a woman writer of war fiction and of the British Empire in decline. Her works are critical of war, racism, colonialism and imperialism, and examine themes <b>of</b> <b>displacement</b> and physical and emotional alienation.|$|E

The Clamshell–Sawpit Fault lies beneath the San Gabriel Mountains inline with the Raymond Fault. The characteristics of the various faults are difficult to interpret, but they all dip steeply to the north with several thousand feet <b>of</b> <b>displacement.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. Buffy must begin to face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included to convey the sense <b>of</b> <b>displacement</b> and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{measured}} integrated intensities of 26 {{reflections of}} the B 2 -phase of titanium nickelide single crystal and determined structure factors for these reflections. Based on the structure factors, mean squares <b>of</b> <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> Ni and Ti atoms {{with respect to the}} crystal-lattice sites have been determined. After that we determined the mean squares <b>of</b> atomic <b>displacements</b> Ni and Ti in temperature range of existence of the B 2 -pase, at temperatures Т 1 = 328 K and T 2 = 376 K. We separated the mean squares <b>of</b> atomic <b>displacements</b> Ni and Ti into static and dynamic ones. The mean squares <b>of</b> dynamic <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> Ni and Ti atoms are identical, but the mean square <b>of</b> static <b>displacements</b> is greater by a factor of 4. 7 for Ni atoms than for Ti atoms. The Debye temperature calculated from the mean squares <b>of</b> <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> Ni atoms is 360 K; that calculated for Ti atoms in a similar way is 390 K. The large value <b>of</b> complete atomic <b>displacements</b> in TiNi is due to static rather than dynamic <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> atoms, mainly due to static <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> nickel atoms...|$|R

5|$|The pattern <b>of</b> <b>displacement</b> {{along the}} Imperial Fault {{was very similar}} to that {{observed}} for {{the northern part of the}} rupture during the 1940 El Centro earthquake, although on this occasion the rupture did not extend across the border into Mexico. This had been explained as the behavior of individual slip patches along the Imperial Fault with two patches rupturing in 1940 and only the northern one in 1979. The faulting that gave rise to the earthquake has been modeled by comparing synthetic seismograms with near-source strong motion recordings. This analysis showed that the rupture speed had at times exceeded the shear wave velocity, making this the first earthquake for which supershear rupture was inferred.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} not yet been well defined in their areas of roosting. Some have even been found to roost in caves and {{possibly}} housing, though whether this is typical behavior or an effect <b>of</b> <b>displacement</b> is uncertain. Tracking the species by radio signals, {{it was found that the}} species prefers older, larger trees, specifically beeches, perhaps due to possessing relatively spacious trunks and branches, allowing for ease of entry. The species does not have one specific roost, but a network through which the colony can rotate individuals. Recent years have seen less reliance on fossil fuels and rather relying on wood as a source of energy, and consequently an increase in logging, therefore it is important to locate the areas in which they roosts to identify those which should be protected to prevent their decline, through which radio tracking proves an effective method.|$|E

40|$|The {{graduation}} thesis {{discusses the}} comparison of different GNSS survey methods for the determination <b>of</b> small <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> points in a geodetic network. Firstly, the theoretical basics of GNSS technology operation, the characteristics of GNSS methods and the procedure for the determination <b>of</b> <b>displacements</b> are presented. In the main part, the practical use of GNSS methods for detecting small point displacements is described. Moreover, the whole procedure for measuring small displacements is introduced - from fieldwork, measurement processing and computation <b>of</b> point <b>displacements</b> to test statistics. The comparison of different GNSS methods has been made for static, kinematic and RTK method by performing point <b>displacements</b> <b>of</b> the selected point in the geodetic network, from 1 to several cm and from 1 to 3 mm. Position of the selected point has been computed relatively to different reference stations. Point displacements have been determined in three different ways; according to initial position of selected point, as a difference between consecutive positions {{and according to the}} difference between average positions. Furthermore, the computation of the accuracy <b>of</b> <b>displacements</b> and the computation of test statistic, which could be used for the advanced analysis <b>of</b> <b>displacements</b> and consists <b>of</b> the size and the standard deviation of the discussed point displacement, has been presented...|$|R
