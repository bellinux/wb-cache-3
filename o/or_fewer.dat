5|$|Greinke {{made his}} first start for the Angels on July 29. After a stretch of four {{unproductive}} starts from August 3–19 (1–1, 7.20 ERA in 25 innings), Greinke followed up with four consecutive starts of at least seven innings and two <b>or</b> <b>fewer</b> runs — all of them wins.

5|$|Hershey {{began its}} regular season with major {{offensive}} problems. They were outshot in 17 {{of their first}} 18 games, and were held to one <b>or</b> <b>fewer</b> goals in seven of those games. Their 6–10–1–0 start was the lowest total through 17 games since 2004–05, which was the last season they {{failed to make the}} playoffs. After losing their season opener to the Syracuse Crunch, the Bears beat the Binghamton Senators on October 19 despite being outshot 44 to 21. Hershey lost their first home game on October 20, falling 8–7 to the Rochester Americans; the 15-goal total marked the most combined goals from a Bears home opener, up from the previous record of 12 in 1987. Hershey center Ryan Potulny exited the game with an undisclosed injury, and would not return until November 16 after a nine-game absence. The team's defense improved in subsequent games, allowing two goals <b>or</b> <b>fewer</b> in four of their next five matches.|$|E

5|$|A {{supporter}} of nine-man baseball teams, Adams favored a measure in 1856 which allowed for players {{from outside the}} Knickerbockers to join their intrasquad games when 17 <b>or</b> <b>fewer</b> team members appeared. No rules existed at the time regarding team size, but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club. The proposal was defeated by a 13–11 vote, {{in favor of a}} rule forbidding non-club members to play if there were 14 players (seven per team).|$|E
5|$|Bone marrow suppression, {{characterized}} {{particularly by}} thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; {{it appears to}} be the only adverse effect that occurs significantly more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days <b>or</b> <b>fewer,</b> but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 case report suggested that pyridoxine (a form of vitamin B6) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.|$|E

5|$|Charles W. Holliday and Joseph R.

The 2% percent of S.grandis that overlapped with S.convallis were determined by density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second. The markings on S.grandis males {{were found to be}} the same as on females.|$|E

It liberated public health research from medical and clinical research methods that have been restricted to situations of single <b>or</b> <b>few</b> etiological factors and single <b>or</b> <b>few</b> outcomes.

5|$|If a {{body has}} more <b>or</b> <b>fewer</b> {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E

The sandwiches were designed to be a lower fat alternative with 5g of fat and 350 <b>or</b> <b>fewer</b> calories. The line was a health conscious oriented product that got its taste from ingredients instead of fat. They were formally introduced in 2004 as its BK Baguette line of sandwiches, that replacing the Chicken Whopper sandwiches.|$|E
5|$|Integer sorting {{algorithms}} including pigeonhole sort, counting sort, and radix sort {{are widely}} used and practical. Other integer sorting algorithms with smaller worst-case time bounds are not believed to be practical for computer architectures with 64 <b>or</b> <b>fewer</b> bits per word.

It is normal to see fewer higher likelihood and/or consequence clients rather than 50% of the population or 50% of the assessed likelihood or consequence. In other words, the boundary is shifted so there can be a strong focus on the few assessed to be higher risk.|$|E
