5|$|Although {{traditionally}} {{depicted as}} a biped, {{it has been suggested}} since the mid-1970s that Spinosaurus was at least an occasional quadruped. This has been bolstered by the discovery of Baryonyx, a relative with robust arms. Because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the hypothesized fatty dorsal humps of Spinosaurus, Bailey (1997) was open to the possibility of a quadrupedal posture, leading to new restorations of it as such. The hypothesis that Spinosaurus had a typical quadrupedal gait has fallen out of favor, though spinosaurids may have crouched in a quadrupedal posture.|$|E

5|$|As a red dwarf, Gliese 876 is {{much less}} massive than the Sun: {{estimates}} suggest it has only 32% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the Sun.

5|$|In 1997, the {{discovery}} of a 51 Pegasi-like planet orbiting 55 Cancri A was announced, together with the planet of Tau Boötis and the inner planet of Upsilon Andromedae.

These radial velocity measurements still showed a drift unaccounted-for by this planet, which could be explained by the gravitational influence of a more distant object.|$|E

5|$|The {{electrostatic}} force was first described in 1784 by Coulomb {{as a force}} that existed intrinsically between two charges. The properties of the {{electrostatic force}} were that it varied as an inverse square law directed in the radial direction, was both attractive and repulsive (there was intrinsic polarity), was independent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the charged objects, and followed the superposition principle.

Most of the outer irregular moons of Jupiter and Saturn also have retrograde orbits, as do some of Uranus's outer moons. However, these moons are all much more distant from their primaries, and are small in comparison; the largest of them (Phoebe) has only 8% of the diameter (and 0.03% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass)</b> <b>of</b> Triton.|$|E
5|$|When {{the scale}} of the {{divergence}} between the IPK and national kilogram prototypes was reported in 2005, a debate arose on how best to redefine the kilogram – should the kilogram be defined in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the silicon-28 atom or should it be determined using the watt balance? The mass of a silicon atom could be determined using the Avogadro project and using Avogadro's number be linked directly to the kilogram.|$|E
5|$|A later model {{suggested}} that confinement {{resulted from a}} co-rotational eccentricity resonance (CER). The model {{takes into account the}} finite mass of the Adams ring, which is necessary to move the resonance closer to the ring. A byproduct of this theory is a mass estimate for the Adams ring—about 0.002 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> Galatea. A third theory proposed in 1986 requires an additional moon orbiting inside the ring; the arcs in this case are trapped in its stable Lagrangian points. However Voyager 2s observations placed strict constraints on the size and mass of any undiscovered moons, making such a theory unlikely. Some other more complicated theories hold that a number of moonlets are trapped in co-rotational resonances with Galatea, providing confinement of the arcs and simultaneously serving as sources of the dust.|$|E

5|$|After the {{discovery}} of planetary mass companions around PSR B1257+12 in 1990 by Aleksander Wolszczan, data for PSR B1937+21 and other pulsars were analyzed {{for the presence of}} similar companions. By 1994, an upper limit of about one thousandth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> Earth was determined for any companion of PSR B1937+21 within 2 astronomical units. In 1999, Aleksander Wolszczan reported variations in the times of arrival of pulses from PSR B1937+21, as well as previous analysis by Tokio Fukushima which suggested that these timing variations could be caused by a dwarf planet around the pulsar. The data were consistent with a companion having a mass similar to Ceres and located at 2.71 astronomical units from the pulsar, but data {{over a longer period of}} time are required in order to verify the proposed companion. More recent observations have not detected any regular periodic signal associated with this companion, but argue that the slight variations in pulse arrival times are consistent with an asteroid belt having a total mass less than 0.05 that of the Earth, but acknowledge that the detection of periodicity in pulse timing variations associated with individual asteroids is necessary to confirm the possible asteroid belt.|$|E
5|$|Although {{white dwarf}} {{material}} is initially plasma—a fluid composed of nuclei and electrons—it was theoretically predicted in the 1960s {{that at a}} late stage of cooling, it should crystallize, starting at its center. The crystal structure {{is thought to be}} a body-centered cubic lattice. In 1995 it was suggested that asteroseismological observations of pulsating white dwarfs yielded a potential test of the crystallization theory, and in 2004, observations were made that suggested approximately 90% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> BPM 37093 had crystallized. Other work gives a crystallized mass fraction of between 32% and 82%. As a white dwarf core undergoes crystallization into a solid phase, latent heat is released which provides a source of thermal energy that delays its cooling.|$|E
5|$|Another {{method that}} {{is widely used}} in these {{analyses}} is mass spectrometry. Here, accurate measurement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mass</b> <b>of</b> the unmodified native enzyme and the inactivated enzyme gives the increase in mass caused by reaction with the inhibitor and shows the stoichiometry of the reaction. This is usually done using a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. In a complementary technique, peptide mass fingerprinting involves digestion of the native and modified protein with a protease such as trypsin. This will produce a set of peptides that can be analysed using a mass spectrometer. The peptide that changes in mass after reaction with the inhibitor {{will be the one}} that contains the site of modification.|$|E
