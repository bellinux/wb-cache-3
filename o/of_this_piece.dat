The target <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> of biomimicry is the structure of the mounds of termites such as Macrotermes michaelseni which effectively cool the nests of these social insects. The properties of the Namib desert beetle's exoskeleton, in particular its wing-cases (elytra) which have bumps with hydrophilic (water-attracting) tips and hydrophobic (water-shedding) sides, have been mimicked in a film coating designed for the British Ministry of Defence, to capture water in arid regions.|$|E

The notes <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> of music, which are {{believed}} to have belonged to Sumerians and ancient Greeks, were discovered among some ancient inscriptions and after being deciphered by archaeologists, was orchestrated by Siavosh Beizaee for Perspolis Orchestra Symphony. However, as it is demonstrated on ancient reliefs of that era, the instrumentations of such pieces probably comprised wind instruments like horn and pipe. Renowned Iranian musician, Peyman Soltani, conducted the Perspolis orchestra.|$|E
25|$|The Chapel of Christ Crucified (Capela do Senhor Jesus Crucificado) was {{constructed}} in 1589, according to a date {{on the front of}} the arch over it. In the same area are two Renaissance medallions showing the heads of St. Peter and St. Paul. The altarpiece dates from the third quarter of the 18th century, a good example of the Rococo style. The central area is filled by pictures of Our Lady of Sorrows and of St. John the Evangelist, and by the large sculpture of Christ Crucified. Although we do not know the creator <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece,</b> it appears to be by an Algarve artist, reflecting the technical and artistic mastery found elsewhere in the region.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after, Yuan Shao's advisor Xu You, who had harboured dissatisfaction against Yuan Shao for {{not using}} his plan and having his wife arrested by Shen Pei, {{defected}} over to Cao Cao. He understood Cao Cao's {{shortage of supplies}} and alerted Cao Cao to Yuan Shao's exploitable weakness at Wuchao. Cao Cao's generals were suspicious <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> of intelligence, but his advisors Xun You and Jia Xu urged Cao Cao to put Xu You's plan to action. Thus at night, Cao Cao led 5,000 infantry and cavalry to attack Wuchao after leaving Cao Hong and Xun You in charge of his main camp at Guandu. Cao Cao's army disguised itself as a reinforcement unit from Yuan Shao and attacked Wuchao. Chunyu Qiong's initial defences were overrun, and he retreated to hold his forts, which Cao Cao attacked and set on fire.|$|E
25|$|Schoenberg's {{music from}} 1908 onward {{experiments}} {{in a variety}} of ways with the absence of traditional keys or tonal centers. His first explicitly atonal piece was the second string quartet, Op. 10, with soprano. The last movement <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> has no key signature, marking Schoenberg's formal divorce from diatonic harmonies. Other important works of the era include his song cycle Das Buch der Hängenden Gärten, Op. 15 (1908–1909), his Five Orchestral Pieces, Op. 16 (1909), the influential Pierrot Lunaire, Op. 21 (1912), as well as his dramatic Erwartung, Op. 17 (1909). The urgency of musical constructions lacking in tonal centers, or traditional dissonance-consonance relationships, however, can be traced as far back as his Chamber Symphony No. 1, Op. 9 (1906), a work remarkable for its tonal development of whole-tone and quartal harmony, and its initiation of dynamic and unusual ensemble relationships, involving dramatic interruption and unpredictable instrumental allegiances; many of these features would typify the timbre-oriented chamber music aesthetic of the coming century.|$|E
25|$|Bradypodion pumilum have a {{much higher}} {{survival}} rate in a metropolitan area if they are bigger in size. Their survival rate was dependent on body size, and the larger the size, the greater the chance that the individual would survive a ten-day period. Larger, older chameleons {{tend to be more}} sedentary compared to the smaller younger ones which means that the larger ones likely have smaller home ranges. Smaller chameleons inhabit grasses while larger chameleons are found mainly in bushes and trees. This is territorial, because it is believed that larger males would cannibalize smaller ones intruding on their territory. An alternative thought is that the smaller chameleons simply do not have big enough limbs to grasp larger branches correctly. When fighting contests occur, the outcome is influenced by the height of the ornamental casque, the relative size of the pink patch {{in the center of the}} flank, and previous experience. The ornamental casque is the protruding head piece of the chameleon, usually with a rounded end. The height <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> is an honest signal to other male chameleons representing its total size. Similarly with the pink patch in the center of the flank, this is an honest signal showing that the chameleon has a healthy diet correlating to the strength of the individual. The turnover rate in males is thought to be higher than females.|$|E

40|$|The origin <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>pieces</b> stems ideas {{regarding}} discontinuity of the French philosopher Michel Foucault, referenced in his 1969 book, L'Archéologie du Savoir (The Archaeology of Knowledge). He observes {{these ideas}} from an historian's perspective. Foucault {{argues that it}} is more important to recognize a phenomenon as a distinct individual entity (discontinuity), rather than viewing the phenomenon as a link in a long chain <b>of</b> events (continuity). <b>This</b> <b>piece</b> emerges from <b>this</b> concept. Stetigkeit und Unstetigkeit represents several isolated gestures within one continuous larger gesture. The isolated gestures symbolize discontinuity. The piece begins with a gesture of continuity that develops and transforms until the other polyphonic layers emerge as discontinuous elements. <b>This</b> <b>piece</b> presents a possible model of how discontinuity and continuity can coexist within a broader space and time...|$|R

[...] If Field mounted the work, however, the production has not been traced.

Part One (titled [...] "Lucia di Lammermoor") and Part Two (titled [...] "The Diva Dance") <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> are included as separate tracks on The Fifth Element soundtrack, but are sequenced to create the effect of the entire performance seen in the film.

500|$|Apart {{from the}} madrigal books, Monteverdi's only {{published}} collection {{during this period}} was the volume of Scherzi musicale in 1632. For unknown reasons, the composer's name does not appear on the inscription, the dedication being signed by the Venetian printer Bartolemeo Magni; Carter surmises that the recently ordained Monteverdi may have wished to keep his distance from this secular collection. It mixes strophic continuo songs for solo voice with more complex works which employ continuous variation over repeated bass patterns. Chew selects the chaconne for two tenors, Zefiro torna e di soavi accenti, as the outstanding item in the collection: [...] "he greater part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece</b> consists of repetitions of a bass pattern which ensures tonal unity of a simple kind, owing to its being framed as a simple cadence in a G major tonal type: over these repetitions, inventive variations unfold in virtuoso passage-work".|$|E

500|$|For The Lion Kings {{first film}} trailer, Disney opted to feature a single scene, the entire opening {{sequence}} {{with the song}} [...] "Circle of Life".

The trailer was released in November 1993, accompanying The Three Musketeers in theaters, as only a third of The Lion King had been completed. Audience reaction was enthusiastic, causing Hahn to have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up to the expectations raised by the preview. Prior to the film's release, Disney did 11 test screenings.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, the British {{palaeontologist}} Mark P. Witton {{reported the}} [...] "rediscovery" [...] of a jaw-piece {{that belonged to}} specimen NHMUK R3877, but which had been neglected in a drawer for a century, perhaps removed shortly after Hooley's 1913 article. Though Hooley included an illustration <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>piece,</b> it was not incorporated into his reconstruction of the skull, and the skull length he proposed was repeated by workers until Witton's report. Witton concluded that the jaw-piece represented almost the entire missing portion of the skull, and suggested that the skull {{would have been much}} shorter than previously assumed, making I. latidens very distinct from other istiodactylids. Witton's updated skull reconstruction was different enough from the skull of I. sinensis for him to conclude they did not belong in the same genus, but he advised against placing I. sinensis in its own genus. Witton pointed out that the two Istiodactylus species had been grouped with Liaoxipterus brachyognathus in previous studies, and that I. sinensis may instead have been a species in the genus Liaoxipterus, or even the same species, since they were found in the same formation and had few differences. He provisionally retained the existing taxonomy, awaiting further investigation of the issue.|$|E
