Those who still wait at least have the alternative of enduring the inconvenience of dialysis treatment until <b>an</b> <b>organ</b> is available. However, in many other countries, dialysis treatment is not an option. Nor is there a well developed cadaver organ retrieval program. The only choices are death or <b>obtaining</b> <b>an</b> <b>organ</b> from <b>a</b> live donor. Resort to exploitative and/or criminal practices {{may be seen as}} the only way out. Not surprisingly, a black market in organs has developed, in which organs fetch high prices. This Trends and Issues examines the criminal consequences of the international organ shortage, and looks at alternative public policy strategies for boosting supply. All countries are faced with <b>an</b> <b>organ</b> shortage and it is increasingly possible for patients to travel to agencies around the world to acquire a transplant. Policy developments in this area will require the collaboration of both health officials and law enforcement agencies. Duncan Chappel...|$|R
