Legend joins the two siblings {{of high and}} divine rank: Papahānaumoku ("Papa from whom lands are born", or Earth mother) and Wākea (Sky father). Together they create the islands of Hawaii and a beautiful woman, Hoʻohokukalani (The Heavenly <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> the stars).|$|E
25|$|Unlike an option, {{both parties}} of a futures {{contract}} must fulfill the contract on the delivery date. The seller delivers the underlying {{asset to the}} buyer, or, {{if it is a}} cash-settled futures contract, then cash is transferred from the futures trader who sustained a loss to the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> a profit. To exit the commitment prior to the settlement date, the holder of a futures position can close out its contract obligations by taking the opposite position on another futures contract on the same asset and settlement date. The difference in futures prices is then a profit or loss.|$|E

She has credited her daughter Maddie as the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> her publicly endorse Obama. She was frequently mentioned as a possible vice-presidential nominee for Obama, but was never seriously considered. She spoke on the opening day of the Democratic National Convention in August 2008.|$|E

25|$|In a December {{game against}} the Seattle Seahawks, Testaverde was {{involved}} in a play that was cited as an impetus for the NFL's adoption of a new instant replay review system the next season. With the Jets trailing 31-26 and twenty seconds left in the game, Testaverde attempted to score on a quarterback sneak on fourth and goal from the Seattle five-yard line. Testaverde had been tackled and the ball was not across the goal line when this happened, but because Testaverde's helmet had crossed the line the game's head linesman, Earnie Frantz, ruled the play a touchdown. The Jets won the game 32-31 and the loss was said to have cost the Seahawks a playoff berth and coach Dennis Erickson his job. The game's referee, Phil Luckett, drew criticism for the call although he was not the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> it.|$|E

500|$|As {{part of the}} award, {{which was}} valued at C$20,000, Loder was given a {{membership}} for both the East Coast Music and MusicNL trade associations, and was given time at a recording studio and advice from music industry and production professionals. She was also engaged in a featured performance slot at the following year's YC Newfoundland. Loder later referred to the music professionals she met (including Scott Mansfield, Mark Peddle, and NewManiac Studios' Peter Newman) as [...] "the top players" [...] {{in the music industry}} of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the producers helped Loder with Imperfections & Directions, her second album. She was particularly appreciative of Newman, who produced the album, mixing Imperfections & Directions with Tom Laune in Nashville, Tennessee. Loder originally conceived [...] "Fearless" [...] (one of the album's tracks) as a techno song, and believes that Newman was the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> that techno feel a reality.|$|E

500|$|Swanton {{believed}} that Constantine {{was the first}} West Indian cricketer to make an impression on the British public: [...] "he... personified West Indian cricket from the first faltering entry in the Test arena in 1928 until the post-war emergence of the trinity of Worrell, Weekes and Walcott." [...] Swanton continued: [...] "There have been many all-rounders with better records... {{but it is hard}} to think of <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> a more sensational impact [...] impossible to imagine his superior as a fielder anywhere." [...] In 1934 Neville Cardus described Constantine as a [...] "genius" [...] and the [...] "most original cricketer of recent years". R. C. Robertson-Glasgow called Constantine the most exciting cricketer to watch of all his contemporaries. This was partly because his style of cricket meant that he could alter the course of a match in a short space of time, although he developed his technique to minimise risk.|$|E
500|$|Saint-Just {{saved his}} dignity at the lectern {{but not his}} life. Rising in his support, Robespierre {{sputtered}} and lost his voice; his brother Augustin, Philippe Lebas, and other key allies all tried to sway the deputies, but failed. The meeting ended with an order for their arrest. Saint-Just, still on the platform, remained unmoved and [...] "looked on contemptuously" [...] at the scene. His confidence seemed validated when troops from the Paris Commune under Hanriot arrived to liberate them, but within hours the entire group was confined to the Hôtel de Ville. When soldiers finally broke inside, {{a number of the}} defeated Jacobins tried to commit suicide; Saint-Just stood beside Lebas who shot himself in the head. Any contemplation of his own suicide is unclear, but he alone emerged unruffled from the wild, violent final arrest – among the captured, [...] "only St. Just, his hands bound but his head held high, was able to walk." [...] Robespierre, Saint-Just and twenty of their allies were guillotined the next day, and Saint-Just reputedly accepted his death with coolness and pride. At a last formality of identification, he gestured to a copy of the Constitution of 1793 and said, [...] "I am the <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>made</b> that." ...|$|E

So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate." [...] (Matthew 19:4-6, NRSV translation; Mark 10:6-9 is a parallel text)Rob Gagnon, an associate professor of New Testament studies, argues it is [...] "obvious" [...] that Jesus' back-to-back references to Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 show that he [...] "presupposed a two-sex requirement for marriage" [...] even though the question he was being asked was about a contemporary dispute about whether married couples could divorce.|$|E

Robinson recalled, [...] "We knew {{as soon as he}} auditioned – the way he ran with his stomach sticking out – that he'd be perfect." [...] Geeves recalled in 2006, [...] "I was asked to first of all run around, then run around and scream, then run around screaming topless, it was at that point I thought 'aye-aye, this isn't the normal run of the mill advert'." [...] The orange paint on him was orange grease paint fixed with hairspray, which took several weeks to remove after filming.
