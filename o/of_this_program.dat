5|$|Depression set {{in among}} members {{throughout}} the storm-battered community once the rebuilding process began. Fears of possible emigration stemming soon arose. Mayor Tai Herman feared that survivors would consider selling {{their homes and}} leave the Cook Islands altogether. Even Prime Minister Jim Marurai {{was reported to be}} left in shock by the scale of damage. The government enacted a three-month psychological support plan accordingly to help residents cope with the disaster and maintain social integrity among victims. Through September, 265people took advantage <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty {{predicted}} that all Majestic-class carriers would require upgrades to their aircraft lifts and arrester gear {{in the early}} 1950s, to operate the faster and heavier carrier aircraft under development. Originally, the RAN wanted to upgrade Sydney to the same or similar standard as sister ship , after the second carrier was delivered. The installation of an angled flight deck and mirror landing aid, would have allowed Sydney to operate modern jet aircraft. However, financial and manpower restrictions led to the cancellation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>program.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout July the {{battalion}} undertook garrison duties in Trieste before the 2nd New Zealand Division was withdrawn to Lake Trasimene.

In September it was decided that as part of the departure of New Zealand troops from the theatre, memorial services would be held at the locations of the division's major battles. As a part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>program</b> services were held at Cassino and Sangro and on Crete, while smaller parties were sent to Coriano Ridge, Faenza, Forli, Padua, Monfalcone and Udine.|$|E

5|$|Like all French draft breeds, the Norman Cob was {{threatened}} by the advent of mechanization in farming. The only option left to many breeders was to redirect their production to the meat markets. However, the Norman Cob avoided this, {{through the efforts of}} Laurens St. Martin, the head of the Saint-Lo stud in 1944 and the developer of the Selle Francais. He began crossing Thoroughbred stallions with Norman Cob mares to produce Selle Francais horses, and the success <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>program</b> allowed a reorientation of the Cob breeding programs. Although population numbers continued to decline until 1995, the physical characteristics of the breed remained much the same, not growing heavier and slower as many of the French draft breeds did due to breeding for the production of meat. Even today, some Selle Francais from Norman bloodlines are similar to the Norman Cob in appearance.|$|E
5|$|The HL234, {{an engine}} born from the {{developments}} initiated {{by attempting to}} convert the Maybach HL230 to fuel injection, would have increased the power to about 800 to 900 PS (hp). The Entwicklungskommission Panzer unanimously decided that HL234 be immediately included in the engine design and procurement program. The AK-7-200 was also explored {{as an alternative to}} the Maybach Olvar-B drive train, but Waffenamt research and development department Wa Prüf 6 found that it offered inferior driving characteristics and so the Maybach Olvar-B was retained. There are also a program using the Simmering- Graz-Pauker Sla.16 engine, but the war's constraint on supplies and capitulation resulted in the cancellation <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>program.</b> Krupp proposed mounting a new main weapon, the 10.5cm KwK L/68. Wa Prüf 6 was not supportive of this as the Heer had not accepted the cannon itself. Other suggested improvements included stabilised sights, a stabilised main gun, an automatic ammunition feed, a Zeiss stereoscopic range finder, heated crew compartment, stowage for an additional 12 rounds, and an overpressure & air filtration system to protect against poison gas. However, these also never got beyond the proposal stage or did not enter production before the war ended.|$|E
