40|$|Background: <b>On-call</b> <b>duty</b> among medical interns is {{characterized}} by sleep deprivation and stressful working conditions, both of which alter cardiac autonomic modulation. We hypothesized that sleep stability decreased in medical interns during <b>on-call</b> <b>duty.</b> We used cardiopulmonary-coupling (CPC) analysis to test our hypothesis. Methods: We used electrocardiogram (ECG) -based CPC analysis to quantify physiological parameters of sleep stability in 13 medical interns during on-call and on-call duty-free periods. There were ten 33. 5 -h <b>on-call</b> <b>duty</b> shifts per month for interns, each followed by 2 on-call duty-free days, over 3 months. Measurements during sleep were collected before, during, and after an on-call shift. Measurements were repeated 3 months later during an on-call duty-free period. Results: The medical interns had significantly reduced stable sleep, and displayed increased latency to the first epoch of stable sleep during the on-call night shift, compared to the pre-call and on-call duty-free nights. Interns also had significantly increased rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep during the on-call night shift, compared to the pre-call and on-call duty-free nights. Conclusion: Medical interns suffer disrupted sleep stability and continuity during on-call night shifts. The ECG-based CPC analysis provides a straightforward means to quantify sleep quality and stability in medical staff performing shift work unde...|$|E
40|$|Physiotherapists {{working in}} {{hospitals}} are commonly required to undertake emergency <b>on-call</b> <b>duties.</b> Concerns {{from within the}} profession {{about the quality of}} on-call services have been expressed. The aims of this study were to audit oncall practice in New Zealand, identify variations in service provision and ascertain physiotherapists’ concerns in providing these services. A postal questionnaire was distributed to senior physiotherapists in all New Zealand hospitals expected to provide physiotherapy emergency <b>on-call</b> <b>duties</b> (n = 38).

Assessment of competency to undertake <b>on-call</b> <b>duties,</b> agreed standards of practice, the use of protocols, training and support provided were ascertained. Respondents were asked to highlight their most important concerns in the provision of their on-call service. These were found to be maintenance of competency, service provision, training and resource issues.

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the perceptions of}} physiotherapists with different levels of context related experience undertaking emergency <b>on-call</b> <b>duties</b> in New Zealand (NZ). A purpose-designed questionnaire was developed to investigate whether differences existed between novice and expert physiotherapists in their perceptions of emergency <b>on-call</b> <b>duties</b> and in their responses to an emergency on-call vignette. A questionnaire was administered to 71 participants with varying levels of on-call experience, in all centres providing emergency on-call services within NZ. Years of active emergency on-call experience were used to classify novices (less than 5 years) and experts (more than 5 years). A response rate of 79 % (n = 56) was obtained. Significant differences between novices and experts were seen in self-rated confidence scores, self-rated stress levels and perceived support required whilst undertaking emergency oncall duties (all p <. 001). There were {{no statistically significant differences}} between novices and experts in response to any questions in the vignette. The results of this study provide useful information for service providers regarding the perceptions and concerns of emergency on-call physiotherapists.

We set out to analyze the interrelationships between working conditions, job satisfaction, burnout and mental health among Japanese physicians. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2007 for hospital physicians throughout Japan. A path analysis based on structural equation modeling was utilized for examining the interrelationships between work control, <b>on-call</b> <b>duty</b> volume, job satisfaction (the Japan Hospital Physicians Satisfaction Scale), burnout (the Japanese version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory) and mental health (the General Health Questionnaire). Of 336 physicians who received a solicitation E-mail, 236 participated in our study (response rate, 70 %). Sixty physicians (25. 4 %) were women {{with a mean age}} of 41 yr. In the path analysis, burnout and poor mental health were related directly to job dissatisfaction and short sleeping time, while they were related indirectly to poor work control and heavy <b>on-call</b> <b>duty.</b> In the multi-group path analysis of both genders, sleeping time was related to job satisfaction more likely among female physicians but less among male physicians.

40|$|Background: Despite the {{increased}} availability of resuscitation courses and guidelines requiring optimal training for acute situations, {{little is known}} on the actual qualification of house staff with in-hospital <b>on-call</b> <b>duties</b> for critically ill newborns and children. Objective: To assess (1) the characteristics of education and training; (2) the level of experience; and (3) factors that may hamper optimal performance of paediatric specialist registrars caring for acute critically ill newborns and children. Methods: A structured questionnaire was completed by a national cohort of all paediatric specialist registrars in their fourth year (ie pre-final) of training. Results: Important shortcomings in training and assessment of actual qualifications of resuscitation competencies were identified in paediatric specialist registrars. In 17 of 57 (30 %) specialist registrars, competencies in acute care had never been assessed or reconfirmed when starting <b>on-call</b> <b>duties</b> while in the others, 40 (70 %), substantial heterogeneity was found regarding the type of assessment of qualifications for <b>on-call</b> <b>duties.</b> In acute situations, occasionally untrained and unsupervised resuscitation procedures were performed. Individual responsibility {{was the most important}} stressor that may hamper optimal performance. Despite these findings, adequate reported levels of self-confidence were found; self confidence was higher in newborns as compared to children (7. 8 and 7. 0 respectively on scale 1 - 10, p < 0. 05).

40|$|Aim: To {{assess the}} {{workload}} of general practitioners (GPs) in Austria, {{with a focus}} on identifying the differences between GPs working in urban and rural areas. Methods: Within the framework of the Quality and Costs of Primary Care in Europe (QUALICOPC) study, data were collected from a stratified sample of GPs using a standardized questionnaire between November 2011 and May 2012. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and regression analysis. Results: The analysis included data from 173 GPs. GPs in rural areas reported an average of 49. 3 working hours per week, plus 23. 7 <b>on-call</b> <b>duties</b> per 3 months and 26. 2 out-of-office care services per week. Compared to GPs working in urban areas, even in the fully adjusted regression model, rural GPs had significantly more working hours (B 7. 00; P[*]=[*] 0. 002) and <b>on-call</b> <b>duties</b> (B 18. 91; P[*]<[*] 0. 001). 65. 8 % of all GPs perceived their level of stress as high and 84. 6 % felt they were required to do unnecessary administrative work.

40|$|Introduction. This year, the World Health Organization {{focuses on}} {{restoring}} {{dignity and respect}} to health care workers. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the workplace stressors in physicians. Material and Methods. The present study was performed in the period 2002 - 2004, among physicians treated in the Health Center Novi Sad. The examinees were asked to fill out a questionnaire - a workplace survey - to identify workplace stressors by using a self-evaluation method. The physicians were divided into three groups: those practicing surgery (S), internal medicine (IM) and preventive-diagnostics (PD). Statistical analysis was done using SPSS and STATISTICA software. The sample included 208 physicians with an average age of 40 years (SD= 7, 1); average work experience of 22 years (SD= 8, 1). Results. 65 physicians from group S and 108 physicians from group IM, identified the following workplace stressors: treating patients in life-threatening situations (47. 7 %, 30. 6 %, respectfully); <b>on-call</b> <b>duty</b> (13. 8 %, 12 %); low salary (10. 8 %, 10. 2 %); limited diagnostic and therapeutic resources in the IM group. 35 physicians from the DP group identified the following stressors: low salary (25 %), treating patients in life-threatening situations and a great number of patients (16 %). The analysis of all examined physicians revealed the following workplace stressors: treating patients in life-threatening situations (34. 6 %), low salary (13 %), <b>on-call</b> <b>duty</b> and overtime, and too many patients per physician (11. 5 %). Conclusion. Restoring the reputation of health workers can be done by providing new equipment to resolve life-threatening situations, by increasing salaries, reducing on-call time, as well as the number of patients. Generally speaking, this should help to improve the quality of work in the health care system, in accordance with the recommendations of the WHO. ...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to determine what differences exist between novice and expert physiotherapists within the emergency on-call environment. A purpose-designed postal questionnaire was administered to emergency on-call providers in New Zealand. The questionnaire investigated participant’s attitudes towards emergency on-call service provision and presented a vignette-based clinical scenario. A response rate of 78. 8 % (n = 56) was achieved. Significant differences between novices and experts were determined in scores for confidence (p =. 0001), stress (p =. 001) and support required (p =. 001). Factors which particularly influenced both novice and expert stress levels when working as emergency oncall physiotherapists emerged as being working in isolation and working with a higher complexity of patients. A relationship was determined between confidence, level of support required and amount of stress felt (p =. 001). Differences were demonstrated between novice and expert physiotherapists in their answers to a clinical case scenario particularly in the areas of prioritisation, problem definition and in the interpretation of analysed results. A need for novices to gain the type of experience which has the facility for independent problem solving and guided reflection was determined; the use of vignette based case studies may be one method which could be further exploited to meet these needs...|$|R

Methods. Cross-sectional survey data were collected among a large heterogeneous sample of Dutch employees (N= 5437). The final sample consisted of 157 on-call workers (23 – 69 years, 71 % males). Data were analyzed by means of hierarchical regression analyses (controlling for age and job characteristics). Results. Differences in on-call work exposure were not systematically related to fatigue, WHI, and PPD (all p’s 0. 50). The experience of being on-call explained a medium proportion of the variation in fatigue and strain-based WHI and a medium to large proportion of the variation in time-based WHI and PPD over and above the control variables. Conclusions. Our results suggest that it is employees’ experience of being on-call, especially the experience of stress due to the unpredictability, rather than the amount of exposure, that is related to fatigue, WHI, and perceived on-call performance difficulties...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{introduction}} of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD) has greatly reduced training hours of surgical residents, which translates into 30 % less surgical and clinical experience. Such a dramatic drop in attendance has serious implications such compromised quality of medical care. As the surgical department of the University of Heidelberg, {{our goal was to}} establish a model that was compliant with the EWTD while avoiding reduction in quality of patient care and surgical training. Methods: We first performed workload analyses and performance statistics for all working areas of our department (operation theater, emergency room, specialized consultations, surgical wards and <b>on-call</b> <b>duties)</b> using personal interviews, time cards, medical documentation software as well as data of the financial- and personnel-controlling sector of our administration. Using that information, we specifically designed an EWTD-compatible work model and implemented it. Results: Surgical wards and operating rooms (ORs) were not compliant with the EWTD. Between 5 pm and 8 pm, three ORs were still operating two-thirds of the time. By creating an extended work shift (7 : 30 am- 7 : 30 pm), we effectively reduced the workload to less than 49 % from 4 pm and 8 am, allowing the combination of an eight-hour working day with a 16 -hour on call duty; thus, maximizing surgical resident training and ensuring patient continuity of care while maintaining EDTW guidelines. Conclusion: A precise workload analysis is the key to success. The Heidelberg New Working Time Model provides a legal model, which, by avoiding rotating work shifts, assures quality of patient care and surgical training...|$|R
40|$|Background: Poorly functioning, time-consuming, and {{inadequate}} information systems {{are among the}} most important work-related psychosocial factors causing stress in physicians. The present study examined the trend in the perceived stress that was related to information systems (SRIS) among Finnish physicians during a nine-year follow-up. In addition, we examined the associations of gender, age, employment sector, specialization status, leadership position, on-call burden, and time pressure with SRIS change and levels. Methods: A longitudinal design with three survey data collection waves (2006, 2010 and 2015) based on a random sample of Finnish physicians in 2006 was used. The study sample included 1095 physicians (62. 3 % women, mean age 54. 4 years) who provided data on SRIS in every wave. GLM repeated measures analyses were used to examine the associations between independent variables and the SRIS trend during the years 2006, 2010, and 2015. Results: SRIS increased during the study period. The estimated marginal mean of SRIS in 2006 was 2. 80 (95 % CI = 2. 68 - 2. 92) and the mean increase was 0. 46 (95 % CI = 0. 30 - 0. 61) points from 2006 to 2010 and 0. 25 (95 % CI = 0. 11 - 0. 39) points from 2010 to 2015. Moreover, our results show that the increase was most pronounced in primary care, whereas in hospitals SRIS did not increase between 2010 and 2015. SRIS increased more among those in a leadership position. <b>On-call</b> <b>duties</b> and high time-pressures were associated with higher SRIS levels during all waves. Conclusions: Changing, difficult, and poorly functioning information systems (IS) are a prominent source of stress among Finnish physicians and this perceived stress continues to increase. Organizations should implement arrangements to ease stress stemming from IS especially for those with a high workload and <b>on-call</b> or leadership <b>duties.</b> To decrease IS-related stress, it would be important to study in more detail the main IS factors that contribute to SRIS.

40|$|Doctors {{take many}} forms of leave to further career training. Many {{hospital}} rotas omit these and are not updated frequently to reflect swaps in <b>on-call</b> <b>duties.</b> As a result, confusion arises with reduced staffing levels leading to sub-optimal patient care. Using Google Sheets, rota’s can be modified to be team specific, remotely accessed, and edited by any device with an internet connection and web browser. A qualitative pre and post-implementation questionnaire assessed {{the usefulness of the}} online rota. The rota was trialled on a surgical and medical team containing foundation year, core medical, core surgical, and registrar trainees. The respective surgical and medical rotas were copied, modified and pasted into a Google Sheet to contain only team specific information including all forms of leave. A link was emailed allowing teams to access and edit the rota. Post-implementation questionnaire 90 % (n= 10) stated they could access it remotely and 100 % felt the new rota was very easy to use. Finally, 80 % stated the Google Doc rota was a definite improvement on the old trust rota. The rota was then trialled on an ITU SHO rota (n= 8). The results were reproducible with 88 % feeling it addressed their requirements and stating it was an improvement on their old rota. As a result of the implementation appropriate staffing levels were maintained on the ward. The key advantages of the Google rota are that it included all forms of leave and helped ensure adequate staffing levels on the ward. The remote nature means easy access even if off-site and can be viewed easier on smart phones. The different privacy settings ensure security of document.

The regulation of the working time {{is one of the}} most important working conditions especially for the workers due to the fact that they spend more than one third of their day at work. In case of the healtcare workers it's even more than one third of their day. In first chapters I pursued regulation of the working time from the view of the international law, in concrete from the view of the Conventions of International Labour Organization. I focused more on the European Union regulations, especially on the Working Time Directive, because due to this directive there is no longer the institute of the <b>on-call</b> <b>duty</b> at workplace in czech legislation. The Directive also allowed to legitimize further agreed overtime work for healthcare works. In the third chapter I focused on the regulation of the working time itself. I analyzed the characteristics and compared the current wording with the definition in the Labour Code from the 1965. In the following chapters I analyzed the lenght of working time and its scheduling. I pointed out the differences between fixed, short [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In 2007, the patient’s {{right to}} {{specialised}} palliative home care became law in Germany. However, childhood palliative care in territorial states with low patient numbers and long distances requires adapted models to ensure an area-wide maintenance. Actually, general paediatricians {{are the basic}} care providers for children and adolescents. They also provide home care. The {{aim of this study}} was to improve the knowledge about general paediatrician’s involvement in and contribution to palliative care in children. Findings To evaluate the current status of palliative home care provided by general paediatricians and their cooperation with other paediatric palliative care providers, a questionnaire survey was disseminated to general paediatricians in Lower Saxony, a German federal state with nearly eight million inhabitants and a predominantly rural infrastructure. Data analysis was descriptive. One hundred forty one of 157 included general paediatricians completed the questionnaire (response rate: 89. 8 %). A total of 792 children and adolescents suffering from life-limiting conditions were cared for by these general paediatricians in 2008. Severe cerebral palsy was the most prevalent diagnosis. Eighty-nine per cent of the general paediatricians stated that they had professional experience with paediatric palliative care. Collaboration of general paediatricians and other palliative care providers was stated as not well developed. The support by a specialised team including 24 -hour <b>on-call</b> <b>duty</b> and the intensification of educational programs were emphasised. Conclusions The current regional infrastructure of palliative home care in Lower Saxony can benefit from the establishment of a coordinated network of palliative home care providers. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Several {{studies have}} shown {{impaired}} mental well-being and performance in physicians work on call, but knowledge of the physiological effects is scarce. The aims {{of the present study}} were to investigate if there was a metabolic stress response in the restitutional phase after night-call duty, indicating potential negative health effects, and determine whether there were differences between physician specialities. Methods: Anaesthesiologists (n = 19) were compared with paediatricians/ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeons (n = 18). On an ordinary workday, 1 and 3 days after work on night call, blood samples were taken for analysis of glucose, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine, testosterone, insulin growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL and LDL), triglycerids (TG) and insulin. Saliva cortisol was sampled on an ordinary working day, a day including 16 -h night call, the third day following, and for anaesthesiologists also on a day off work. Results: TSH differed significantly between days in both groups, with a 26 % lower level 1 day after <b>on-call</b> <b>duty</b> (P < 0. 001). A 48 % cortisol rise in the morning preceding night duty was found for paediatricians/ENT surgeons (P < 0. 01). Conclusion: The significant dip in TSH level 24 h after night-call duty indicates a metabolic effect of working on night call and should be studied further. However, the levels were within the normal range and the overall results do not imply any serious metabolic changes and only minor differences were seen between specialist groups...|$|E
40|$|The {{implementation}} of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD), has considerably altered the organisation of junior doctors’ work hours. Total hours have been reduced and full shift schedules have replaced traditional on-call rotas. The negative consequences of shiftwork have been extensively documented; effects are reported to include disrupted sleep, impaired vigilance, cognitive impairment, social isolation, as well as negative effects on mood, job performance, mental health and physical health (Issac 2000, Akerdstedt 2003). However, {{little is known about}} the effects that the new shift schedules have upon junior doctors. The current study examined the effects of shift work on junior doctor’s performance, sleep, alertness, health and general well-being, through qualitative one-to-one interviews. Ten junior doctors, from five NHS Trusts across Wales participated in a semistructured interview. Participants included doctors from Foundation Level one and two, Specialist Trainees and Specialist Registrars. Inductive Thematic Analysis indicated a complex relationship between work hours and fatigue influenced by shift sequence, career goals and organisational support systems. Three main themes emerged from the data; ‘Doctor’s schedules’ identified specific shift features which were associated with disrupted sleep and intensified fatigue. The impact of working many consecutive night shifts, together with frequent and poorly distributed <b>on-call</b> <b>duties,</b> were discussed in terms of decreased performance, medical error and concern for patient care. ‘Work-life balance’ depicted an unsatisfactory balance between work and home life, disrupted social and family lives due to anti-social shifts, sleep deprivation and work related fatigue, complicated further by career goals and educational needs. ‘Social and organisational support structures’ identified a critical role for departmental moral and team spirit. Good support structures in the work place acted as a buffer against the demands of difficult work schedules, and negative role stressors. Implications are drawn for schedule design to reduce fatigue alleviate sleep deprivation and improve welfare of junior doctors. 1 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Due to the {{decrease}} in informal care by family members and the demographic development, the importance of professional geriatric care will rise considerably. Aim {{of this study was}} to investigate the psychosocial workplace situation for employees in this profession. Methods The German version of the COPSOQ (Copenhagen Psychosocial Questionnaire) was used for the assessment of psychosocial factors at work. The instrument includes 22 scales and 3 single items concerning demands, control, stress, support, and strain. Results between two study groups of geriatric care were compared to each other as well as to employees in general hospital care and a general population mean (COPSOQ database). Statistical analysis included t-tests, ANOVA and multiple comparisons of means. Statistical significance (p Results In total 889 respondents from 36 institutions took part in the study. 412 worked in Home Care (HC), 313 in Geriatric Nursing Homes (GNH), 164 in other professions (e. g. administration). Comparison between HC and GNH showed more favourable values for the first group for the most scales, e. g. lower quantitative and emotional demands and less work-privacy conflict, better possibilities for development etc. Compared to external values from the German COPSOQ database for general hospital care (N = 1. 195) and the total mean across all professions, COPSOQ-total (N = 11. 168), the results are again positive for HC workers on most of the scales concerning demands and social support. The only negative finding is the very low amount of social relations at work due to the obligation to work alone most of the time. Employees in GNH rate predictability, quality of leadership and feedback higher when compared to general hospital care and show some further favourable mean values compared to the COPSOQ mean value for all professions. A disadvantage for GNH is the high rating for job insecurity. A supplementary subgroup analysis showed that the degree of negative evaluation of psychosocial factors concerning demands was related to the amount of working hours per week and the number of <b>on-call</b> <b>duties.</b> Conclusions Compared to employees in general hospital care and the COPSOQ overall mean value across all professions, geriatric care employees and especially home care workers evaluate their psychosocial working situation more positive for most aspects. However, this seems partly due to the very high proportion of part-time workers. Critical results for the two study groups are the relatively high job insecurity in nursing homes and the lack of social relations for the HCrs. </p...|$|R
