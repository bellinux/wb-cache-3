5|$|As {{reported}} by Esme Smyth, Ashton Court's last resident, Sir John Smyth (1776–1849) {{was responsible for}} the remodeling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>In</b> about 1940 she was interviewed by Raymond Gorges, who was researching a book, and she gave him an engraving of the house showing the additions that she said were made by Sir John.|$|E
5|$|Beckham's {{political}} career began in 1894 {{when he was}} elected without opposition to the Kentucky House of Representatives.

He also served as a delegate to every Democratic National Convention from 1900 to 1920.|$|E
5|$|Helm was re-elected to {{the state}} House in 1827 and 1830, and was re-elected every year from 1833 to 1837. He served as Speaker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>in</b> 1835 and 1836. In 1837 there was a {{three-way}} race for speaker between Helm, James Turner Morehead and Robert P. Letcher. After nine ballots Helm withdrew, and Letcher was elected speaker.|$|E

5|$|Much of {{the present}} house {{was built in the}} early 14th century by Sir John de Clevedon. There is {{speculation}} that it may lie on the site of a Roman building, based on excavations to the south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> 1961/62. The house incorporates remnants of a 13th-century building which lie at an angle {{to the rest of the}} house. It was situated nearly two miles inland from the parish church of St Andrew, which stands on the coast.|$|E

5|$|Randall's {{defense of}} smaller, less {{centralized}} government raised his profile among House Democrats, and they elevated him to Speaker in 1876. He held that post until the Democrats lost control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>in</b> 1881, {{and was considered}} a possible nominee for President in 1880 and 1884. Randall's support for high tariffs began to alienate him from most Democrats, and when that party regained control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>in</b> 1883, he was denied another term as Speaker. Randall continued to serve in Congress {{as head of the}} Appropriations Committee. He remained a respected party leader, but gradually lost influence as the Democrats became more firmly wedded to free trade. Worsening health also curtailed his power until his death in 1890.|$|E
5|$|Robert Perkins Letcher (February 10, 1788 – January 24, 1861) was a {{politician}} and lawyer from the US state of Kentucky.

He also served in the Kentucky General Assembly where he was Speaker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>in</b> 1837 and 1838. A strong supporter of the Whig Party, {{he was a friend}} of Henry Clay and John J. Crittenden.|$|E

5|$|As Democrats {{took control}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>in</b> 1875, Randall was {{considered}} among the candidates for Speaker of the House. Many in the caucus hesitated, however, believing Randall to be too close to railroad interests and uncertain on the money question. His leadership in the Salary Grab may have harmed him, as well. Randall was also occupied by an intra-party battle with William A. Wallace {{for control of the}} Pennsylvania Democratic Party. Wallace, who had been elected to the United States Senate in 1874, was weakened by rumors that he had taken bribes from the railroads while a member of the State Senate. Randall wanted control of the Democratic machine statewide, and the Wallace faction's vulnerability on the bribery rumors provided the opportunity. In January 1875, he had friends in the state legislature begin an investigation into Wallace's clique, which ultimately turned state Democratic leaders against the senator. At the state Democratic convention in September 1875, Randall (with the help of his old ally, Squire McMullen) triumphed, putting his men in control of the state party.|$|E
5|$|At {{the onset}} of the 2008 campaign, Hunter had served in Congress since 1981; {{representing}} California's 42nd (1981–83), 45th (1983-93), and 52nd (since 1993) congressional districts. During his tenure, he boasted a 92% lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union (ACU). Some of his successes included the passage of legislation leading to the construction of the 14-mile double-fence from the Pacific Ocean to Otay Mesa along the U.S.-Mexico border. He also helped pass the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which provided for the construction of an additional 670 miles of fence. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, Hunter pushed for increased military spending and advancements in military technology. He became chairman of the committee in 2003 and remained in the position until the Democratic Party won the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>in</b> the 2006 mid-term election.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{adjournment}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>in</b> September 1789, they requested Hamilton to make {{a report}} on suggestions to improve the public credit by January 1790. Hamilton had written to Robert Morris as early as 1781 that fixing the public credit will win their objective of independence. The sources that Hamilton used ranged from Frenchmen such as Jacques Necker and Montesquieu to British writers such as Hume, Hobbes, and Malachy Postlethwayt. While writing the report he also sought out suggestions from contemporaries such as John Knox Witherspoon, and Madison. Although they agreed on additional taxes such as distilleries and duties on imported liquors and land taxes, Madison feared that the securities from the government debt would fall in foreign hands.|$|E

5|$|Berkeley House on Piccadilly {{was named}} after John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton who had {{purchased}} its land, and that surrounding it, shortly after the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660. In 1696, the Berkeley family sold the house and grounds to the 1st Duke of Devonshire (who renamed it Devonshire House) on the proviso that {{the view from the}} rear of the house should not be spoiled. Berkeley Square was laid out to the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> the 1730s; because of the conditions of sale, houses were only built on the east and west sides of it. The west side still has various mid-18th century buildings along it, while the east side now contains offices including Berkeley Square House.|$|E
5|$|Bird's nest custody is an {{uncommon}} {{form of joint}} custody in which, rather than having the children go from one parent's house to the other parent's house, the parents {{move in and out}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> which the children constantly reside. The goal of this arrangement is to shift the burden of upheaval and moving between homes onto the parents rather than the children. However, due to the high cost of maintaining three households, one for each parent and one for the children, it's rarely a viable option in a custody case.|$|E
5|$|By 1853 {{a service}} range {{had been added}} to the south wing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>In</b> 1868 the {{external}} flight of stairs was removed from the west front and a new porch entrance was added to its ground floor. The entrance featured a Norman doorway that had been moved from elsewhere in the monastery; Greene believes that it probably formed the entrance from the west cloister walk into the nave of the church. An exact replica of this doorway was built and placed {{to the north of the}} Norman doorway, making a double entrance. The whole of the undercroft was radically restored, giving it a Gothic theme, adding stained glass windows and a medieval-style fireplace. The ground to the south of the house was levelled and formal gardens were established.|$|E

5|$|First {{owned by}} Eldon {{resident}} Charles Dibble after its construction in 1881 and 1882, {{the home was}} (with one 1897 exception) a private residence until the late twentieth century. After a thirty-year preservation effort culminated with the donation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> 1991 to the State Historical Society of Iowa, the site now includes the original house in its 1930 form and a visitors center. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Since 1991, various caretaker-occupants have continued to rent the home privately.|$|E
5|$|Gillard {{worked in}} the {{industrial}} department of the law firm Slater & Gordon from 1988 through to 1995.

Gillard provided pro-bono legal assistance to help establish the AWU Workplace Reform Association for Wilson and his associate Ralph Blewitt. She was also involved in providing legal services in relation to the purchase of a Fitzroy property by Wilson and Blewitt. Wilson and Blewitt have been accused of creating the association in order to use a slush fund for personal benefit, including diverting funds for the purchase <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> Fitzroy.|$|E
5|$|Growing {{weary of}} his workload, Gray {{and his wife}} {{departed}} {{on a trip to}} Britain, Egypt (for three months), and Switzerland in September 1868. It was during the winter spent in Egypt that Gray first grew his white beard. They returned in autumn 1869. In early 1872 Gray tried to resign his professorship and garden duties still with no replacement for himself. He proposed only looking after the herbarium and writing books in exchange for the rent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>in</b> which he and his wife lived on the university grounds. Due to the way the finances of the funding sources were handled and the lack of a replacement, Gray was unable to resign at that time.|$|E
