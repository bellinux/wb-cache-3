5|$|In Wallonia, {{literature}} in French began a revival in 1881 {{with the creation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>La</b> Jeune Belgique ("The Young Belgium") movement, which supported the creation of distinctively Belgian literature and opposed romanticism. Among {{the members of the}} Jeune Belgique were the writer Camille Lemonnier, whose works were often set against the background of Belgian peasant life in the naturalist style, and the poet Charles Van Lerberghe. French language poetry flourished in Belgium in the early 20th century under Émile Verhaeren and Maurice Maeterlinck; Maeterlinck was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1911.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the terms}} were agreed to, Buffalo marked and was {{recorded}} as Pe-zhe-ke, head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>La</b> Pointe delegation. Although Buffalo {{and the other}} Lake Superior chiefs signed, they {{were said to be}} relatively silent compared with the Mississippi Chippewa chiefs during the negotiations. Historian Satz says this symbolized disagreement rather than acceptance of the terms of the treaty. Lyman Warren, a trader and interpreter from La Pointe, later complained that the Pillagers (bands from present-day Minnesota) had been bribed into selling the lands rightfully belonging to the Wisconsin bands.|$|E
5|$|Other dinosaurs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>La</b> Amarga Formation {{include the}} {{stegosaur}} Amargastegos; predatory dinosaurs include the small ceratosaur Ligabueino, {{and the presence}} of a large tetanuran is indicated by teeth.

Crocodylomorphs are represented by the trematochampsid Amargasuchus– the holotype of this genus was found in association with the Amargasaurus bones.|$|E

5|$|The graves {{made by the}} Iazyges {{were often}} {{rectangular}} or circular in shape. They were flat, and were grouped like a modern cemetery. During the time after the Iazyges migrated to the Tisza plain, and were in serious poverty. This {{is reflected in the}} poor furnishings of the burial sites, often filled with clay vessels, beads, and sometimes brooches. Very rarely would there be iron daggers in the burial site, and even more rarely would there be iron swords. Their brooches and arm-rings were <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>La</b> Tène type, showing a distinct influence on the Iazyges by the Dacians.|$|E

5|$|Activity {{after the}} caldera's {{formation}} created lava domes and rhyolitic lava flows along its ring faults. One flow was dated at 1,090,000 ± 110,000 years old, and the domes are 1.4 to 1.2 million years old. La Reforma eruption products were later partially buried by activity from El Aguajito, where volcanic activity had migrated to. Basaltic cones which erupted 600,000 {{years ago on}} the caldera's flanks despite their location are not part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>La</b> Reforma volcano; like Isla Tortuga and Tres Virgenes, they are controlled by the tectonic processes that accompanied the rifting of the Sea of Cortez. Also, rivers deposited sediments inside the caldera itself. Seismic activity still occurs at Tres Virgenes volcano. La Reforma could still experience large scale explosive volcanism, especially in its southwestern part.|$|E
5|$|Balzac {{began using}} {{characters}} from earlier works in his 1835 novel Le Père Goriot, {{and made the}} technique a hallmark of his fiction. In the case of Z.

The title character of that story is married to Xavier Rabourdin, who is unjustly ignored for a promotion to the head of his civil service department. At the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>La</b> Femme supérieure, Rabourdin pledges to his wife that they will enjoy success in the world of business. His son's poverty in Z.
