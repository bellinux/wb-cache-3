50|$|In his 1973 book Behind the Mirror: A Search for a Natural History of Human Knowledge, Lorenz {{considers}} the old philosophical {{question of whether}} <b>our</b> <b>senses</b> correctly inform us about {{the world as it}} is, or provide us only with an illusion. His answer comes from evolutionary biology. Only traits that help us survive and reproduce are transmitted. If <b>our</b> <b>senses</b> gave us wrong information about our environment, we would soon be extinct. Therefore, we can be sure that <b>our</b> <b>senses</b> give us correct information, for otherwise we would not be here to be deceived.|$|R
5000|$|Third, the {{perceptions}} of each individual sense seemingly {{have nothing in common}} with the other senses: i.e., the color [...] "red" [...] {{has little to do with}} the feeling of touching a red object. This is manifest when <b>our</b> <b>senses</b> [...] "disagree" [...] with each other: for example, a mirage presents certain visible features, but is not responsive to any other kind of sense. In that case, <b>our</b> other <b>senses</b> defeat the impressions of sight. But one may also be lacking enough powers of sense to understand the world in its entirety: if one had an extra sense, then one might know of things in a way that the present five senses are unable to advise us of. Given that <b>our</b> <b>senses</b> can be shown to be unreliable by appealing to other <b>senses,</b> and so <b>our</b> <b>senses</b> may be incomplete (relative to some more perfect sense that one lacks), then it follows that all of <b>our</b> <b>senses</b> may be unreliable.

25|$|In {{addition}} to its Afrocentric point of view, Wild Seed has also been classified as an Afrofuturistic text. As Elcye Rae Helford contends, the novel is part of Butler’s larger project to “depict the survival of African-American culture throughout history and into the future.” Indeed, as the origin story of the Patternist series, which follows the exploits of a race of genetically-mutated black superhumans who eventually rule Earth in the 27th century, Wild Seed revises <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> of human history as directed by white supremacy.|$|E

He argues this process of realization is based on experience and is not contingent on faith.

Christopher Hitchens in God is Not Great has argued that [...] "Modern vernacular {{describes}} conscience—not too badly—as whatever it is that makes us behave well when nobody is looking...

500|$|As {{newcomers}} to the Scooby Gang, Tara Maclay and Giles' girlfriend Olivia (Phina Oruche) are inexperienced with monsters, and were brought in to express [...] "real childlike terror". Willow had, after three seasons, grown considerably more confident, having found her intellectual and emotional niche at college, and therefore was no longer evincing the terror she once had; Tara, shy, unsure of herself, and unaccustomed to such experiences, served {{to fill the gap}} that Willow's maturing had created. According to Buffy essayist Patrick Shade, Tara's and Olivia's fear [...] "heighten(s) <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> of vulnerability and so make these scenes more frightening". Joss Whedon has said that one of his favorite shots in the episode is of Olivia's frightened reaction to a Gentlemen floating by her window, leering in at her.|$|E
500|$|Miller also {{aimed to}} imbue the novel {{with a sense}} of anxiety, {{especially}} concerning the decisions Jean-Baptiste must take. Commenting on fiction in general in an interview with Lorna Bradbury for The Daily Telegraph, Miller stated that [...] "a novel is a collection of anxieties held together, more or less well, more or less interestingly, by the chicken wire of plot". Bradbury goes on to state [...] "that is absolutely the case with Pure, which details multiple counts of insanity as the panic-inducing business of razing the cemetery takes hold". Of Pure specifically, Miller stated that [...] "I'm interested in what anxiety does to people", [...] "in what happens when they can't respond the way the world expects them to. What happens when <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> of ourselves falls away under the pressure of circumstances? What's left? That's a very interesting place to be." ...|$|E
50|$|In his {{academic}} inaugural lecture at Leipzig of 1900 on The Extension of <b>our</b> <b>Senses,</b> he presented {{the theory of}} physical education {{in the context of}} evolutionary theory. He took up Heinrich Hertz's theory that separates internal images —a conceptualization of reality— from descriptions of experiment(Principles of Mechanics, 1894). It was the dawn of media technology. Wiener added to Hertz's work, and theorized cinematography as an extension of <b>our</b> <b>senses</b> (1900).|$|R
30|$|As the {{analysis}} mentioned in Section 3.1, {{to capture the}} discriminative spatio-temporal feature of the fall, it requires that the system can sense the time-varying HME of each sub-region. In <b>our</b> <b>sensing</b> model design, each sampling cell corresponds to a sub-region of the monitored region, and the PIR sensors are employed to capture the time-varying HME of these sampling cells. Therefore, <b>our</b> <b>sensing</b> model satisfies the design requirements. <b>Our</b> <b>sensing</b> model is an intrinsic non-isomorphic model, which means the number of PIR sensors M {{is less than the}} number of sampling cells L, and the measurement of each PIR sensor is a linear combination of the sampling cells [30]. However, its sensing efficiency is high, that is, it can robustly detect the fall by processing low-dimensional sensor data directly. The reason lies in that the <b>our</b> <b>sensing</b> model captures the most discriminative spatio-temporal feature of the fall by efficient spatial segmentation. In Section 5, we will elaborate the system implementation, and list the specification of the reference structure.|$|R

500|$|... "It's a SpongeBob Christmas!" [...] was {{the first}} {{full-length}} episode of the series to be produced in stop motion animation. Mark Caballero, Seamus Walsh, and Christopher Finnegan animated it at Screen Novelties, while Caballero and Walsh served as the directors. Screen Novelties was chosen by the show's executives to execute the animation because they had already worked with them before in other several smaller projects. These include the revamping of the opening title sequence of the show for 2009's SpongeBob's Truth or Square. Walsh explained, [...] "They dug one of our shorts that we'd done a while back, which was called Graveyard Jamboree with Mysterious Mose, and wanted to have us apply our sensibilities to SpongeBob ...

500|$|With the {{validity}} of the agreement in question, the tribes, joined by the Indian Rights Association (IRA) and local ranchers, lobbied against its ratification by Congress. [...] The IRA wrote letters to Senators, stating that the agreement was: [...] "utterly destructive of that honor and good faith which should characterize our dealings with any people, and especially with one too weak to enforce their rights as against us by any other mean as than an appeal to <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> of justice." [...] The Secretary of the Interior informed Congress that the allotment would be devastating to the tribes, as the land was not suited to farming, and the amount of land allotted would not allow them sufficient land to graze cattle. [...] A bill was introduced in 1892 to ratify the agreement, but failed to receive the necessary votes. [...] It was reintroduced every year until it passed in 1900, eight years later. [...] The agreement finally passed when the Rock Island Railroad agree to set aside an additional 480,000 acres of pastureland for the tribes to hold in common.|$|E
500|$|All of Ecstasys seven {{tracks were}} written and {{composed}} by Kevin Shields, with Colm Ó Cíosóig credited as the co-writer of three tracks—"The Things I Miss", [...] "Clair" [...] and [...] "(Please) Lose Yourself in Me". Regarding the lyrical {{content of the}} album {{in contrast to the}} music, Shields said that [...] "the songs may sound sweet, but the subject matter isn't necessarily very nice. A lot of it is relationship-based, but it's always vague, and never just boy-meets-girl. It could easily be boy-meets-boy, or girl-meets-girl. Then there's hate, and whimsical thoughts you get from nowhere". Ó Cíosóig remarked that [...] "it's more weird perversions of feeling you get in a relationship" [...] and referred to the lyrics as being marked by [...] "extremes, because we're entertained by extreme things". Shields noted that the lyrics were a progression from the band's earlier releases as [...] "the idea of composing a sweet pop song that sugar-coated some lyrical horror and sending it hurtling up the charts appealed to <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> of humour" [...] and considered the songwriting process for Ecstasy as [...] "fresh after having made pure noise earlier".|$|E

[...] Murray continued that he [...] "especially liked... that in the midst of all this end-times rush, it pauses periodically to check in with the various characters in short one-on-one scenes, strengthening <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> of what these relationships mean. (It's something that Fringe has gotten good at in the past year-and-a-half, and something I wouldn't have predicted for the show back in season one.)"

He explored Afrocentric themes on [...] "Revelations" [...] and compared love to a gunfight on [...] "Pistola". On [...] "Roses", Muldrow sang nature-friendly lyrics about drawing flowers in times of sadness rather than plucking them from the ground. [...] "Roses is about creativity and human capacity", she explained. [...] "A lot of times Western society makes [...] base <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> of worth on 'diamonds are forever' or 'a dozen roses' and that's how you prove your love to somebody... but you receive so many gifts and still feel empty.

Writing in World Literature Today, Mona Knapp concluded that Lessing's heroine, the [...] "good terrorist", is neither a good person, nor a good revolutionary. She knows how to renovate houses and manipulate people to her advantage, but she is unemployed and steals money from her parents. When real revolutionaries start using the squat to ship arms, she panics and, going behind her comrades' backs, makes a telephone call to the authorities to warn them. Knapp called Alice [...] "a bad terrorist and a stunted human being". Fishburn suggested that it is Lessing herself who is the [...] "good terrorist", symbolised here by Alice, but that hers is [...] "political terrorism of a literary kind", where she frequently disguises her ideas in [...] "very domestic-looking fiction", and [...] "direct challenge... <b>our</b> <b>sense</b> of reality".|$|E
