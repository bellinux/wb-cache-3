5|$|Gumbo z'herbes {{may have}} {{originated}} with the French, Germans, <b>or</b> <b>West</b> Africans. It has similarities to the French dish potage aux herbes ("soup with greens"), {{as well as}} to the African callaloo. The meatless dish also bears striking resemblance to a dish often eaten in Germany on Maundy Thursday. German Catholics, obeying the Lenten rules, often served a stew made of seven different greens on this date.|$|E

5|$|A {{district}} {{is governed by}} a District Collector, who is better known as a District Magistrate (DM) {{in the state of}} West Bengal. A DM is an officer from either Indian Administrative Service (IAS) <b>or</b> <b>West</b> Bengal Civil Service (WBCS), and is appointed by the State Government of West Bengal.

A subdivision is governed by a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), better known as a Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO). Other than urban units such as town municipalities, a subdivision contains 'community development blocks' (also known as CD blocks or blocks). A block consists of urban units such as census towns and rural units called gram panchayats. A block is administered by a Block Development Officer (BDO), who is appointed by the Government of West Bengal.|$|E
5|$|After {{a lengthy}} public {{debate over whether}} to place the station to the east <b>or</b> <b>west</b> of the Wallkill River, {{it was built in}} 1870 on the east bank, within the village of New Paltz. The rail line was {{formally}} opened during a large ceremony on December20, 1870. A decade later the station had become a popular departure point for the Mohonk Mountain House by many vacationers, including two U.S. presidents. In the late 19th century, over a dozen stagecoaches ran between the station and Mohonk daily.|$|E

5|$|As {{implemented}} in October 1970, the CDH system {{is divided into}} eight zones: six in the Lower Peninsula and two in the Upper Peninsula. This contrasts to the state highway system that makes no attempt to group designations by geography in the state. The boundaries for each zone are determined by major state trunkline highways on each peninsula. Each highway is given a designation composed of the zone letter followed by a two-digit number. Within the zone, numbers are assigned on a grid system: north–south highways use odd numbers and east–west highways have even numbers. Lower numbers are used to the south <b>or</b> <b>west</b> sides of the zones.|$|E

Three neighborhoods in the Cuyahoga Valley are sometimes referred to as the south side: Industrial Valley/Duck Island, Slavic Village (North and South Broadway), and Tremont.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area. Cold north, northwest, <b>or</b> <b>west</b> winds generally blow across the lake following {{the passage of a}} cold front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E

5|$|However, further {{excavations}} {{revealed that}} the 8th-century temple was constructed over the remains of an older brick temple. According to Thirumoorthy, the garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum of the brick temple was filled with sand and covered with granite slabs upon which the newer temple was constructed. Sathyamurthy, Superintendent, ASI Chennai Circle, said that the brick temple could be dated to the Sangam period as the shrine faced north unlike modern temples which face either east <b>or</b> <b>west.</b> This proved conclusively that the temple was constructed before the 6th or 7th century AD when the shilpa shastras, the canonical texts of temple architecture, were written. Estimates {{of the age of}} the brick shrine range from 1700 to 2200 years.|$|E
5|$|The Mainland is {{the largest}} island of Orkney. Both of Orkney's burghs, Kirkwall and Stromness, are on this island, {{which is also the}} heart of Orkney's {{transportation}} system, with ferry and air connections to the other islands and to the outside world. The island is more densely populated (75% of Orkney's population) than the other islands and has much fertile farmland. The Mainland is split into areas called East and West Mainland. These areas are determined by whether they lie East <b>or</b> <b>West</b> of Kirkwall. The bulk of the mainland lies West of Kirkwall, with comparatively little land lying East of Kirkwall.|$|E

5|$|The extreme {{points of}} India include the {{coordinates}} that are further north, south, east <b>or</b> <b>west</b> {{than any other}} location in India; and the highest and the lowest altitudes in the country. The northern-most and eastern-most points claimed by India are both in territory disputed between India and China. With the exception of Kanyakumari (Cape Comorin), the southern-most location of mainland India, all other extreme locations are uninhabited.But some consider Indira point as the extreme tip {{but it is not}} wrong but is not correct too.|$|E
5|$|The {{manipulation}} {{of time at}} higher latitudes (for example Iceland, Nunavut or Alaska) has little impact on daily life, because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons (in comparison to other latitudes), and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of phase with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock. DST is also of little use for locations near the equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight {{in the course of}} the year. The effect also varies according to how far east <b>or</b> <b>west</b> the location is within its time zone, with locations farther east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations farther west in the same time zone.|$|E
5|$|The plans {{called for}} two {{simultaneous}} attacks against Allied naval {{vessels in the}} Indian and South Pacific oceans. These attacks were intended as diversions ahead {{of the attack on}} Midway Island in the North Pacific, with the Japanese hoping to convince the Allies that they intended to attack to the south <b>or</b> <b>west</b> of their conquests. Eleven submarines of the 8th Submarine Squadron were to carry out the two attacks, the five submarines of the Western Attack Group in the Indian Ocean, and the six submarines of the Eastern Attack Group in the Pacific Ocean. The submarine groups were to select a suitable port of attack, based on their own reconnaissance.|$|E

5|$|At {{one point}} as a {{tropical}} storm, the thunderstorm activity around Kristy {{appeared to be}} organizing into hooking bands, and further intensification was considered likely, potentially as strong as 60mph (95km/h). However, the thunderstorm activity decreased markedly on September6, primarily from dry air entrainment, and it weakened to tropical depression status for the last time. In one forecast, Kristy was predicted {{to move into the}} area of warning responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center, <b>or</b> <b>west</b> of 140°W. However, the depression was unable to maintain organized convection around its center for a few days, and Kristy degenerated into a remnant low on September8. The low turned to the southwest, degenerating into a tropical wave on September9 about 1500miles (2400km) southeast of the island of Hawaii, or about 1600miles (2600km) southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula. The remnant disturbance continued westward, and initially Kristy was believed to have developed into Tropical Depression Two-C in the central Pacific Ocean; however, post-season analysis concluded the systems were separate.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown fabric, with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The fabric used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the fabric also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the fabric used by Virginia Military Institute, <b>or</b> <b>West</b> Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E
