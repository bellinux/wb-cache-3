5|$|In {{contrast}} to the cities, unincorporated rural settlements known as colonias <b>often</b> <b>lack</b> basic infrastructure and are marked by poverty. The office of the Texas Attorney General stated, in 2011, that Texas had about 2,294 colonias and estimates that about 500,000 lived in the colonias. Hidalgo County, as of 2011, has {{the largest number of}} colonias. Texas has the largest number of people of all states, living in colonias.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to local}} {{conditions}} it was sometimes {{necessary for the}} Commission to deviate from its standard design. In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. These measures are intended to prevent masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground. In Italy, headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone {{because it was in}} more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flush to the ground. Due to their smaller size, the markers <b>often</b> <b>lack</b> unit insignia.|$|E
5|$|Prehistoric art in Scotland is {{visual art}} created or {{found within the}} modern borders of Scotland, before the {{departure}} of the Romans from southern and central Britain in the early fifth century CE, which is usually seen as the beginning of the early historic or Medieval era. There is no clear definition of prehistoric art among scholars and objects that may involve creativity <b>often</b> <b>lack</b> a context {{that would allow them to}} be understood.|$|E
5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women <b>often</b> <b>lack</b> bargaining power because they have limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E

25|$|Armstrong {{was noted}} for his {{colorful}} and charismatic personality. His autobiography vexed some biographers and historians, {{as he had}} a habit of telling tales, particularly of his early childhood when he was less scrutinized, and his embellishments of his history <b>often</b> <b>lack</b> consistency.|$|E

25|$|Inalienable {{possession}} constructions <b>often</b> <b>lack</b> overt possessors. There is {{debate as}} to how to account for this cross-linguistic universal difference in form. Iconicity explains this in terms {{of the relationship between the}} conceptual distance between the possessor and possessee, while economy explains this through frequency of possession.|$|E
25|$|Black metal songs often {{stray from}} {{conventional}} song structure and <b>often</b> <b>lack</b> clear verse-chorus sections. Instead, many black metal songs contain lengthy and repetitive instrumental sections. The Greek style—established by Rotting Christ, Necromantia and Varathron—has more traditional heavy metal and death metal traits than Norwegian black metal.|$|E
25|$|Despite some genetic sex differences, {{environmental}} factors play {{a large role}} in biological changes during adolescence. For example, girls tend to reduce their physical activity in preadolescence and may receive inadequate nutrition from diets that <b>often</b> <b>lack</b> important nutrients, such as iron. These environmental influences in turn affect female physical development.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrangement}} of the inner ear in living amphibians is, in most respects, {{similar to that of}} reptiles. However, they <b>often</b> <b>lack</b> a basilar papilla, having instead an entirely separate set of sensory cells at the upper edge of the saccule, referred to as the papilla amphibiorum, which appear to have the same function.|$|E
25|$|A {{workplace}} bully or abuser {{will often}} have issues with social functioning. These {{types of people}} often have psychopathic traits {{that are difficult to}} identify in the hiring and promotion process. These individuals <b>often</b> <b>lack</b> anger management skills and have a distorted sense of reality. Consequently, when confronted with the accusation of abuse, the abuser is not aware that any harm was done.|$|E
25|$|The yorker is {{regarded}} as particularly effective against weak tail-end batsmen, who <b>often</b> <b>lack</b> the skill to defend even a non-swinging yorker and who are sometimes less susceptible to other bowling tactics. It is also particularly effective in the later stages of an innings in one-day cricket, {{because it is the}} most difficult of all deliveries to score off even if defended successfully. Runs will often only be scored off edges or straight down the ground.|$|E

25|$|Because of the {{prolonged}} fermentation in ripened pu'erh and slow oxidization of aged raw pu'erh, these teas <b>often</b> <b>lack</b> the bitter, astringent properties of other teas, {{and can be}} brewed much stronger and repeatedly, with some claiming 20 or more infusions of tea from one pot of leaves. On the other hand, young raw pu'erh is known and expected {{to be strong and}} aromatic, yet very bitter and somewhat astringent when brewed, since these characteristics are believed to produce better aged raw pu'erh.|$|E
25|$|Older dams <b>often</b> <b>lack</b> a fish ladder, {{which keeps}} many fish from moving {{upstream}} to their natural breeding grounds, causing failure of breeding cycles or blocking of migration paths. Even {{the presence of}} a fish ladder does not always prevent a reduction in fish reaching the spawning grounds upstream. In some areas, young fish ("smolt") are transported downstream by barge during parts of the year. Turbine and power-plant designs that have a lower impact upon aquatic life are an active area of research.|$|E
25|$|Some {{groups are}} {{especially}} vulnerable to human rights abuses collateral to drug law enforcement. Specifically in Northern Border states that have seen elevated levels of drug-related violence, human rights violations of injection drug users (IDUs) and sex workers by law enforcement personnel include physical and sexual violence, extortion, and targeting for accessing or possession of injection equipment or practicing sex work, although these activities are legal. Such targeting is especially deleterious because members of these marginalized communities <b>often</b> <b>lack</b> the resources and social or political capital to vindicate their rights.|$|E
