5|$|Bond {{occasionally}} supplements his {{alcohol consumption}} {{with the use}} of other drugs, for both functional and recreational reasons: Moonraker sees Bond consume a quantity of the amphetamine benzedrine accompanied by champagne, before his bridge game with Sir Hugo Drax (also consuming a carafe <b>of</b> <b>vintage</b> Riga vodka and a vodka martini); he also uses the drug for stimulation on missions, such as swimming across Shark Bay in Live and Let Die, or remaining awake and alert when threatened in the Dreamy Pines Motor Court in The Spy Who Loved Me.|$|E
5|$|Brisco was {{developed}} by Boam and Cuse {{at the request of}} Fox executive Bob Greenblatt. Impressed by the duo's work on the script for Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Greenblatt suggested they develop a series that bore the tone and style <b>of</b> <b>vintage</b> movie serials. The initial ideas and proposals from the show's writers were more often suited for film than television and had to be scaled down. Brisco {{was one of the last}} television shows to be filmed on the Warner Bros. Western backlot. Randy Edelman composed the distinctive theme music, which has been reused by the National Broadcasting Company during its coverage of the Olympic Games.|$|E

5|$|On March 8, 2010, Valve {{announced}} that Steam was developing a client for OS X. The announcement {{was preceded by}} {{a change in the}} Steam beta client to support the cross-platform WebKit web browser rendering engine instead of the Trident engine of Internet Explorer. Before this announcement, Valve teased the release by e-mailing several images to Mac community and gaming websites; the images featured characters from Valve games with Apple logos and parodies <b>of</b> <b>vintage</b> Macintosh advertisements. Valve developed a full video homage to Apple's 1984 Macintosh commercial to announce the availability of Half-Life 2 and its episodes on the service; some concept images for the video had previously been used to tease the Mac Steam client.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} Madonna in different styles and fashions. It also includes her dripping in twenty million dollars worth <b>of</b> <b>vintage</b> jewels and gowns in several transformations, including an original 25carat ring and bracelet that was worn by West in the 1933 film, She Done Him Wrong. A real doctor (Dr. David Kish) {{was hired by}} Madonna to administer the fake shots, since {{she wanted to make}} the scenes appear real. The first day of shooting took place on June 2, 2003, and the scenes shot included the wall-of-mirrors, the massage, the botox injection and the ballet dancing sequences. The next day started with the French maid, the motel TV, the telephone conversation and the glamour shot scenes. Henry Keazor, {{one of the authors of}} Rewind, Play, Fast Forward: The Past, Present and Future of the Music Video, noted that Madonna exposed herself during the interventions portrayed in the video, by playing with the rumors and the stereotypes surrounding her.|$|E

40|$|An {{integrated}} model {{is defined as}} one that not only models the data generation process (DGP) but also models the data measurement process. A natural framework for such an {{integrated model}} is the state space approach, with the optimal combination <b>of</b> preliminary <b>vintages</b> <b>of</b> data and predictions from the data generation process model being obtained by application of the Kalman filter. The author shows that substantial reductions in the mean square error <b>of</b> preliminary <b>vintages</b> <b>of</b> data on consumers' expenditure {{can be obtained from}} this approach. This provides further evidence that preliminary vintages are not efficient forecasts <b>of</b> the final <b>vintage.</b> Copyright 1995 by Royal Economic Society. ...|$|R
