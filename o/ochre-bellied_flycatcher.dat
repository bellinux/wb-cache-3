50|$|<b>Ochre-bellied</b> <b>flycatcher</b> is an {{inconspicuous}} bird which, unusually for {{a tyrant}} flycatcher, feeds mainly on seeds and berries, and some insects and spiders.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ochre-bellied</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Mionectes oleagineus) {{is a small}} bird of {{the tyrant}} flycatcher family. It breeds from {{southern}} Mexico through Central America, and South America east of the Andes as far as southern Brazil, and on Trinidad and Tobago.|$|E
50|$|Adult <b>ochre-bellied</b> <b>flycatchers</b> are 12.7 cm {{long and}} weigh 11g. They have olive-green upperparts, {{and the head}} and upper breast are also green. The rest of the underparts are ochre-coloured, there are two buff wing bars, and the {{feathers}} of the closed wing are edged with buff. The male is slightly larger than the female, but otherwise similar.|$|R
40|$|Blood {{samples from}} 159 birds of the New-world family Tyrannidae (the flycatchers) {{from the eastern}} plains of Colombia, were {{examined}} for haematozoa parasites, in 1999 - 2000. Haematozoa were detected in six of 20 species. The overall prevalence was 10. 1 %. The most common parasites detected were microfilariae, followed by Trypano-soma and Plasmodium. The highest prevalence (9. 6 %) {{was found in the}} <b>Ochre-bellied</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> (Mionectes oleaginea). Mixed infections with more than one genus of blood parasite were rare and most infections encountered were of low intensity. The {{results of this study suggest}} an important role of ecologically diverse conditions determining compo-sition, transmission, and prevalence of a blood parasite fauna, presumably through host interaction population density. Some new host parasite relationship records are presented. Key words: Haematozoa-Tyrannidae- flycatchers- blood parasites- Neotropical region The neotropical avifauna inhabits the most extensive and luxuriant rainforest in the world as well as a wide range of habitats of the lowland and mountains, and com-prises approximately 3300 species. Flycatchers are prima-rily insectivorous birds, adapted to open or terrestrial environments (Haffer 1985). The distribution of the 37...|$|E
40|$|Circulating androgens {{in adult}} reproductively active male {{vertebrates}} influence {{a diversity of}} organ systems and thus are considered costly. Recently, we obtained evidence that androgen receptors (AR) are expressed in several skeletal muscles of three passeriform birds, the golden-collared manakin (Manacus vitellinus), zebra finch (Taenopygia guttata), and <b>ochre-bellied</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Mionectes oleagieus). Because skeletal muscles that control wing movement make {{up the bulk of}} a bird’s body mass, evidence for widespread effects of androgen action on these muscles would greatly expand the functional impact of androgens beyond their well-characterized effects on relatively discrete targets throughout the avian body. To investigate this issue, we use quantitative PCR (qPCR) to determine if androgens alter gene mRNA expression patterns in wing musculature of wild golden-collared manakins and captive zebra finches. In manakins, the androgen testosterone (T) up-regulated expression of parvalbumin (PV) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), two genes whose products enhance cellular Ca 2 + cycling and hypertrophy of skeletal muscle fibers. In T-treated zebra finches, the anti-androgen flutamide blunted PV and IGF-I expression. These results suggest that certain transcriptional effects of androgen action via AR are conserved in passerine skeletal muscle tissue. When we examined wing muscles of manakins, zebra finches and ochre-bellied flycatchers, we found that expression of PV and IGF-I varied across species and {{in a manner consistent with}} a function for AR-dependent gene regulation. Together, these findings imply that androgens have the potential to act o...|$|E
40|$|The Fall Field Days {{were held}} {{southeast}} of Ashland at the Carol Joy Holling Conference Center September 26 - 28. Field trips to Platte River and Schramm State Parks, Louisville and Memphis SRAs, Jack Sinn WMA, Fontenelle Forest, and Spring Creek Prairie {{were led by}} Kevin Poague, Clem Klaphake, Larry Einemann, Rick Schmid, and Don and Janis Paseka. Hawk migration was in full swing, and we observed 10 species, including a number of Broad-wings and Swainson 2 ̆ 7 s. An American Golden-Plover was a standout among the dozen shorebird species, and 10 warbler species were found, including Black-throated Green and Canada. Total species count was 126. Our speaker on Friday night was NOU member Dr. Daniel Leger, Professor of Psychology at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. His presentation was titled “How Many Bird Species Are There and How Do We Know?” His answer was that there are around 10, 000 species right now, that number is increasing, and we probably will never know how many species there are. He spoke about 2 ̆ 2 cryptic 2 ̆ 2 species, ones that were there all along but were never noticed because we lacked crucial behavioral, vocal, or genetic data. Dr. Leger 2 ̆ 7 s work has included uncovering some cryptic species and will eventually result in the Bright-rumped Attila and the <b>Ochre-bellied</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> each being split into multiple species. On Saturday night, Dr. Robert Gibson, Professor of Biology at the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, spoke about avian lek behavior. Several hundred species of birds exhibit lek behavior, in which clustered males engage in sometimes spectacular courtship behavior while the females are allowed a relatively unhindered choice of a mate. Dr. Gibson 2 ̆ 7 s {{studies have shown that}} females favor males in groups and prefer certain lek hotspots that are close to nesting sites. Only a few of the males actually mate, but the others may have more chance of mating if they display at a known lek site. Another advantage is that an individual bird stands a greater chance of survival during a predator attack in a group than it does if it is alone...|$|E
