40|$|This study aims {{to compare}} the impact of <b>oyster</b> <b>cultures</b> on diagenetic {{processes}} and the phosphorus cycle in the sediments of the Aber Benoît and the Rivière d’Auray, estuary of Brittany, France. Our results showed clear evidence of the seasonal impact of <b>oyster</b> <b>cultures</b> on sediment characteristics (grain size, organic matter parameters), and the phosphorus cycle, especially in the Aber Benoît. At this site, seasonal variations of sulfide and Fe concentrations in pore waters, as well as Fe-P concentrations in the solid-phase highlighted a shift from a system governed by iron reduction (Reference) to a system governed by sulphate reduction (Beneath Oyster). This could be partly explained by the increase in labile organic matter (ie, biodeposits) beneath oysters, whose mineralization by sulfate led to high sulfide concentrations in pore waters (up to 4475 µmol l- 1). In turn, sulfide caused an enhanced release of phosphate in the summer, as adsorption sites for phosphate decreased through the formation of iron sulfide compounds (FeS, FeS 2). In the Aber Benoît, dissolved Fe/PO 4 ratios {{could be used as}} an indicator of phosphate release into oxic water. Low Fe/PO 4 ratios in the summer indicated higher effluxes of phosphate towards the water column (up to 47 µmol m- 2 h- 1). At other periods, Fe/PO 4 ratios higher than 2 mol:mol indicated very low phosphate fluxes. In contrast, in the Rivière d’Auray, the occurrence of macroalgae stranding regularly all over the site, clearly masked the impact of <b>oyster</b> <b>cultures</b> on sediment properties and the phosphorus cycle and made the use of Fe/PO 4 ratios more difficult in terms of indicators of phosphate release...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} heavy metal content (As, Cd, Cu, Hg, Cd, Pb, and Zn) in oysters transplanted in Ebro Delta bays (Alfacs and Fangar) where oysters are traditionally cultured for human consumption. Metal body burdens were monitored weekly during the period ofmaximal agriculture activity from May to June in 2008 and 2009. Results indicate that regardless of the high levels of metals reported in biota living in Ebro River, metal levels in oysters from both bays were similar to those found in unpolluted areas and far below the maximum limits of tolerance recommended by the European Commission. Nevertheless, metal accumulation patterns in oysters differentiate two sources of pollution: one coming from agriculture activities within the Ebro’s delta for As, Cd, Cu, and Zn and other coming from Ebro River probably related to industrial activities upstream (Hg, Pb) or to lead shot pellets form hunting activities (Pb).

40|$|Following a planktonic {{dispersal}} {{period of}} days to months, the larvae of benthic marine organisms must locate suitable seafloor habitat in which to settle and metamorphose. For animals that are sessile or sedentary as adults, settlement onto substrates that are adequate for survival and reproduction is particularly critical, yet represents a challenge since patchily distributed settlement sites {{may be difficult to}} find along a coast or within an estuary. Recent studies have demonstrated that the underwater soundscape, the distinct sounds that emanate from habitats and contain information about their biological and physical characteristics, may serve as broad-scale environmental cue for marine larvae to find satisfactory settlement sites. Here, we contrast the acoustic characteristics of oyster reef and off-reef soft bottoms, and investigate the effect of habitat-associated estuarine sound on the settlement patterns of an economically and ecologically important reef-building bivalve, the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica). Subtidal oyster reefs in coastal North Carolina, USA show distinct acoustic signatures compared to adjacent off-reef soft bottom habitats, characterized by consistently higher levels of sound in the 1. 5 – 20 kHz range. Manipulative laboratory playback experiments found increased settlement in larval <b>oyster</b> <b>cultures</b> exposed to <b>oyster</b> reef sound compared to unstructured soft bottom sound or no sound treatments.

In sediments beneath an active suspended oyster farm, DNRA accounted for 98 % of NO 3 − reduction with rates of up to 169 ± 45 μmol N m− 2 h− 1. Much of this DNRA was fuelled by NO 3 − derived from nitrification. Reference sediments had significantly lower DNRA rates of 83. 8 ± 28. 2 μmol N m− 2 h− 1, however this constituted 96 % of the sites total NO 3 − reduction. Fatty acid analysis showed that sediment organic matter was more labile in the oyster impacted sediments, facilitating subtle shifts in sediment oxygen demand which increased the Fe 2 + availability {{with respect to the}} reference sediments. The difference in DNRA rate between the sites was attributed to autotrophic oxidation of soluble Fe 2 + in sediments underlying the <b>oyster</b> <b>cultures.</b> DNRA was absent in the oyster shell epibiont communities and rates of anammox and denitrification were lower than in the sediments. Production of NH 4 + from the oysters and their associated epibionts was larger than DNRA and reached a rate of 206. 2 μmol N m− 2 h− 1. Nitrous oxide production rates were generally low compared to other aquaculture systems and the net flux of N 2 O for the combined oyster cultivation system (i. e. sediments plus epibionts) was negative, i. e. there was N 2 O consumption in the sediments beneath the oysters.
