5|$|After {{more than}} a year since the band's last concert, Megadeth {{returned}} as a live act in June 1997, beginning a world tour with the Misfits and touring in the United States with Life <b>of</b> <b>Agony</b> and Coal Chamber. In July, the band participated in Ozzfest '98 but, halfway through the tour, Menza reportedly discovered a tumor on his knee and left to undergo surgery. Jimmy DeGrasso, who had collaborated with Mustaine in MD.45, was hired to replace Menza {{for the remainder of the}} tour. Though initially meant to be a temporary replacement, DeGrasso joined the band permanently after the tour. Mustaine later said that he dismissed Menza from the band because he believed the drummer had lied about having cancer.|$|E
5|$|The first church {{built on}} the cathedral site also had a tabernacle, but its exact {{location}} is unknown. During {{the construction of the}} cathedral, the tabernacle was housed in what are now the Chapels of San Isidro and Our Lady <b>of</b> <b>Agony</b> of Granada. However, in the 18thcentury, it was decided to build a structure that was separate, but still connected, to the main cathedral. It is constructed of tezontle (a reddish porous volcanic rock) and white stone {{in the shape of a}} Greek cross with its southern facade faces the Zócalo. It is connected to the main cathedral via the Chapel of San Isidro.|$|E

5|$|The more skin left {{unarmoured}} and exposed, {{the lower}} a gladiator's {{status and the}} greater his perceived effeminacy. Likewise, the engulfing net may {{have been seen as}} a feminine symbol. The light arms and armour of the retiarius thus established him as the lowliest, most disgraced, and most effeminate of the gladiator types. Helmets allowed both gladiators and spectators to dehumanise the fighters; when an arena combatant had to kill a comrade-at-arms, someone he probably lived and trained with every day, his opponent's helmet added an extra layer of separation. However, the retiarius was allowed no head protection; his face was visible to all. The emperor Claudius had all net-fighters who lost in combat put to death so that spectators could enjoy their expressions <b>of</b> <b>agony.</b> The retiariuss fighting style was another strike against him, as reliance on speed and evasion were viewed as undignified in comparison to the straightforward trading of blows. The retiarii lived in the worst barracks. Some members of the class trained to fight as Samnites, another gladiator type, in order to improve their status.|$|E

25|$|In mid-2004 it was {{announced}} that the lineup of Bearer, Neuman, Chickie, and Cronin were again rehearsing and planned on playing a show to serve both as a reunion and as the final farewell the band was never able to give. The reaction from fans led to the booking of another show the following night, and on October 9 and 10, the band played two sold out shows at CBGB, alongside opening bands such as Inhuman, Murphys Law, The Distance and Subzero. Footage from both nights, as well as an extensive documentary, was released as the Beaten By The Fists Of God DVD in 2005. Many high-profile members of the punk rock and hardcore community were featured praising the band in the documentary, including members of Dropkick Murphys, Life <b>of</b> <b>Agony,</b> and Blood For Blood.

25|$|The Romans finally {{captured}} the Antonia Fortress {{and began a}} frontal assault on {{the gates of the}} Temple. Titus was apparently bent on ending Judaism as a religion. He sought to slaughter their animals, kill their men, rape their women, enslave their children, and kill their God. When he finally did breach the walls, his soldiers set upon everyone – man, woman, child, those who stayed loyal to Rome, and those who did not. The city went up in flames. The roar of the inferno mixed with screams <b>of</b> <b>agony</b> as the Romans swept through the upper and lower city, literally clambering over dead bodies in pursuit of the rebels, until they reached the Temple, set it aflame, and reduced it to dust. When the fires subsided, Titus gave the order to destroy the remainder of the city, seeking that no one would remember the name Jerusalem. The Temple was demolished, after which Titus' soldiers proclaimed him imperator in honor of the victory.|$|E
25|$|Supporters {{of hunting}} {{maintain}} that when foxes or other prey (such as coyotes {{in the western}} USA) are hunted, the quarry are either killed relatively quickly (instantly or {{in a matter of}} seconds) or escapes uninjured. Similarly, they say that the animal rarely endures hours of torment and pursuit by hounds, and research by Oxford University shows that the fox is normally killed after an average of 17minutes of chase. They further argue that, while hunting with hounds may cause suffering, controlling fox numbers by other means is even more cruel. Depending on the skill of the shooter, the type of firearm used, the availability of good shooting positions and luck, shooting foxes can cause either an instant kill, or lengthy periods <b>of</b> <b>agony</b> for wounded animals which can die of the trauma within hours, or of secondary infection over a period of days or weeks. Research from wildlife hospitals, however, indicates that {{it is not uncommon for}} foxes with minor shot wounds to survive. Hunt supporters further say that it is a matter of humanity to kill foxes rather than allow them to suffer malnourishment and mange.|$|E

500|$|Slipknot is {{regarded}} as a pioneer of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal; its output has been compared to that of Pantera, Machine Head, Hatebreed, Life <b>of</b> <b>Agony,</b> and Prong, among others. Slipknot is considered a nu metal band. The band's members prefer to distance themselves musically from other nu metal bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Slipknot describes its sound as [...] "metal metal" [...] and regards the link to nu metal as coincidental and a result of nu metal's emergence being concurrent with that of Slipknot. The band's sound typically features a heavily down-tuned guitar setup, a large percussive section, samples, and turntables. Using a variety of vocal styles, the music typically features growled vocals, screaming, backing vocals, as well as melodic singing. The band has continually experimented with its sound, most notably developing tracks led by acoustic guitars and melodic singing that first appeared on Vol. 3 (The Subliminal Verses).|$|E

Schur had to grow out his beard for three months and wear wool clothes on a hot day as part of his character. [...] Mose was based on an actual participant in the UPN reality show Amish in the City.

From 1995 to 1997, Korn toured with Ozzy Osbourne, Sugar Ray, Cradle of Thorns, Incubus, Life <b>of</b> <b>Agony,</b> Metallica, and others. Korn released a promotional disc in 1997 called Life Is Peachy Tour Sampler, with Incubus and The Urge.

500|$|On 30 August 1797, Wollstonecraft {{gave birth}} to her second daughter, Mary. Although the {{delivery}} seemed to go well initially, the placenta broke apart during the birth and became infected; puerperal (childbed) fever was a common and often fatal occurrence in the eighteenth century. After several days <b>of</b> <b>agony,</b> Wollstonecraft died of septicaemia on 10 September. Godwin was devastated: he wrote to his friend Thomas Holcroft, [...] "I firmly believe there does not exist her equal in the world. I know from experience we were formed to make each other happy. I have not the least expectation that I can now ever know happiness again." [...] She was buried at Old Saint Pancras Churchyard, where her tombstone reads, [...] "Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin, Author of A Vindication of the Rights of Woman: Born 27 April 1759: Died 10 September 1797." [...] (In 1851, her remains were moved by her grandson Percy Florence Shelley to his family tomb in St Peter's Church, Bournemouth.) Her monument in the churchyard lies to the north-east of the church just north of Sir John Soane's grave. Her husband was buried with her on his death in 1836, as was his second wife, Mary Jane Godwin (1766–1841).|$|E

500|$|Alan Stanley Blair of Airlock Alpha {{gave the}} episode a mixed review. He {{felt it was}} {{refreshing}} to have a story about aliens that weren't invading and opined that [...] "the brutal scenes at the abattoir and the whale-like moans <b>of</b> <b>agony</b> from the beast tug on a few heartstrings." [...] However, he criticised the realisation of the alien describing it as [...] "basically a giant, moaning turd {{sitting in the middle}} of a warehouse" [...] and [...] "a large lump of putty with eyes". He felt that the episode gave Rhys [...] "a chance to step into the spotlight for a change and prove he has what it takes to carry a story" [...] and felt his reaction to the existence of aliens to be [...] "perhaps the most realistic that the genre has produced". Despite this, he felt that Rhys finding out about Torchwood put an end to the [...] "fun" [...] of Gwen [...] "keeping secrets and concealing her double life" [...] and expressed disappointment that Jack didn't wipe his memory at the end of the episode. Travis Fickett of IGN rated the episode 7.6 on a one to ten scale and felt it provided a [...] "messy, odd and somewhat unsettling twist on alien encounters" [...] but felt the episode had several weak points. He felt it was hard not to see Rhys as [...] "a buffoon" [...] and questioned why Torchwood would use a civilian during a sting operation. He also felt that it pushed [...] "beyond the limits of its capacity to create convincing special effects" [...] and the creature itself looked like [...] "a hand puppet". Andrew Mickel of Den of Geek felt that Rhys has always been the [...] "Welsh heart of the show" [...] and praised his role in the episode for being [...] "actually rather entertaining, approaching everything with invigorating gusto." [...] However he also criticised the denouement of the episode for being [...] "daftly mawkish" [...] and opined that [...] "it’s always impossible to care about CGI characters".|$|E
