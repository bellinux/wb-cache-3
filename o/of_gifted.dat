5|$|More {{accelerated}} {{classes were}} added, but {{the core of}} the gifted curriculum remained the individualized approaches and learning by doing that had long been central to the Avery Coonley curriculum. Nature study was still prominent in the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve the gifted curriculum. In early 1980, an early childhood (EC) program for three-year-olds was launched, designed to cater to the needs <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. Again departing from the prevailing educational theory, Avery Coonley introduced academics in the EC program, with the same focus on nature, music, movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the tensions and contradictions that seem to exist between educators working in the fields of early childhood education and gifted education. Areas in which misunderstandings may occur regarding the education <b>of</b> young <b>gifted</b> children are discussed: the identification <b>of</b> young <b>gifted</b> children, the labelling <b>of</b> young <b>gifted</b> children, the application <b>of</b> appropriate <b>gifted</b> education strategies in the early childhood context, the application of current early childhood approaches to meeting the needs <b>of</b> young <b>gifted</b> children, and the socialisation <b>of</b> young potentially <b>gifted</b> children in the educational setting.

25|$|North Allegheny School District Administration {{reported}} that 1,246 or 15.54% {{of its students}} were gifted in 2009. This was the highest percentage <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania. The second highest percentage <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> students were enrolled at Radnor Township School District at 12.95% of students. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student’s building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility.|$|E

500|$|The {{kindergarten}} {{reading program}} {{was the first}} step in the Avery Coonley School's transition to a new focus on the education of the gifted, which coincided with a growing public awareness of the needs <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> children in the late 1960s. The increasing focus on gifted education was symbolized by the 1972 Marland Report to the United States Congress, which was the first acknowledgment of the characteristics <b>of</b> <b>gifted</b> children and their specific educational needs. The report found that [...] "gifted children are, in fact, deprived and can suffer psychological damage and permanent impairment of their abilities to function well which is equal to or greater than the similar deprivation suffered by any other population with special needs". The report highlighted the necessity for educational services for the gifted, and the near total lack of such programs in the public schools at the time. Malach believed that the educational philosophy of Avery Coonley was well aligned with the most important objectives of a gifted program, namely, [...] "the stimulation of individual interests... the development of student initiative, the development of self-acceptance, concept development, and recognition of the early ability to undertake complex learning tasks." ...|$|E
