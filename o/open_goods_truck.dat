50|$|When {{the need}} arose, the coal {{capacity}} of tenders was sometimes increased by makeshift means, such as constructing wooden extensions for the bunker sides. In the example depicted, the Cape of Good Hope Governor's train is shown arriving in Fort Beaufort behind CGR 7th Class no. 722 for the official {{opening of the}} railway station in 1904. The engine's Type ZC tender's sides had been raised by installing {{what appears to be}} planking, to allow a greater coal load. In addition, an <b>open</b> gondola-type <b>goods</b> <b>truck</b> between the tender and the passenger carriage is loaded with more coal and two workmen.|$|R
50|$|The Kowie Railway's death blow came on 22 April 1911.

Of the 55 passengers, 31 were killed and 23 seriously injured. The resultant claims against the Kowie Railway Company forced it into bankruptcy.|$|R

60|$|I cannot {{discover}} {{any evidence}} of incompetence in Chinese railway administration.

There was a tin shanty siding at Amanzimtoti in 1897 which served as a station. The route from the Amanzimtoti train station to Adams Mission was named Adams Road.

The first hotel was built of wood and iron, but burnt down in May 1899. Amanzimtoti had its first stationmaster in 1902.|$|R
