25|$|Beating {{can also}} be heard between notes that are near to, but not exactly, a {{harmonic}} interval, due to some harmonic of the first note beating with a harmonic of the second note. For example, {{in the case of}} perfect fifth, the third harmonic (i.e. second overtone) of the bass note beats with the second harmonic (first overtone) of the other note. As well as with <b>out-of</b> tune notes, this can also happen with some correctly tuned equal temperament intervals, because of the differences between them and the corresponding just intonation intervals: see Harmonic series (music)#Harmonics and tuning.|$|E
25|$|In February 2004, ITV plc {{announced}} plans to close and sell the Lenton Lane production centre in Nottingham with over 350 jobs being axed in the process Following {{the closure of the}} studios, a new news-gathering centre was established in the city, but production and transmission of Central News East moved to the Birmingham studio in Spring 2005. The former studio complex is now part of The University of Nottingham and is known as 'King's Meadow Campus'. It still maintains one Studio (Studio 7), and this is rented out to television and film Companies, generating income for the University. In October 2004, ITV plc closed Central's presentation/transmission department and moved transmission to the Northern Transmission Centre in Leeds. Although there was heavy opposition, the role of presentation and transmission at Birmingham had been significantly reduced after network presentation was centralised to LNN in London in 2002 and so there was an inevitability that this function would be moved out. CITV (Children's ITV), which had been presented by Central since 1983, was also re-homed to Granada's studios in Manchester, with all content pre-recorded and with <b>out-of</b> vision presentation.|$|E

2500|$|Symptoms of amusia are {{generally}} categorized as receptive, clinical, or mixed. Symptoms of receptive amusia, {{sometimes referred to}} as [...] "musical deafness", include the inability to recognize familiar melodies, the loss of ability to read musical notation, and the inability to detect wrong or <b>out-of</b> tune notes. Clinical, or expressive, symptoms include the loss of ability to sing, write musical notation, and/or play an instrument. A mixed disorder would be a combination of expressive and receptive impairment.|$|E

[...] She said, [...] "the whole experience recurs to my memory as a bad dream and I remember little of its details. I can remember shedding many tears in <b>out-of</b> the way-corners. I thought constantly of my mother and how great must be her grief and worry over me. In my confusion, I could see no way out of the tragic mess." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} 1950, the Polish {{aviation}} industry was re-organised, with large orders being placed for license-production of Soviet Mikoyan–Gurevich MiG-15 jet fighters. As part of this reorganisation, LWD and the CSS were disbanded, {{and work on the}} CSS-12 was suspended. In 1955 flight testing of the CSS-12 resumed. Although testing was successful, with the aircraft setting an international class altitude record of [...] while carrying a payload of [...] on 27 December 1957, no production followed, as the CSS-12 did not meet the requirements of Poland's national airline LOT and no suitable replacements for its <b>out-of</b> production German engines were available.

60|$|Walking {{and leading}} his horse, Daylight {{followed}} the quick-stepping eager little man through the green tunnel and emerged abruptly upon the clearing, if clearing {{it might be}} called, where wild nature and man's earth-scratching were inextricably blended. It was a tiny nook in the hills, protected by the steep walls of a canon mouth. Here were several large oaks, evidencing a richer soil. The erosion of ages from the hillside had slowly formed this deposit of fat earth. Under the oaks, almost buried in them, stood a rough, unpainted cabin, the wide verandah of which, with chairs and hammocks, advertised an <b>out-of</b> doors bedchamber. Daylight's keen eyes took in every thing. The clearing was irregular, following the patches of the best soil, and every fruit tree and berry bush, and even each vegetable plant, had the water personally conducted to it. The tiny irrigation channels were every where, and along some of them the water was running.|$|E
6000|$|The Zenith Athletic Club is not {{athletic}} and it isn't exactly a club, {{but it is}} Zenith in perfection. It has an active and smoke-misted billiard room, it is represented by baseball and football teams, and in the pool and the gymnasium {{a tenth of the}} members sporadically try to reduce. But most of its three thousand members use it as a cafe in which to lunch, play cards, tell stories, meet customers, and entertain <b>out-of</b> town uncles at dinner. It is the largest club in the city, and its chief hatred is the conservative Union Club, which all sound members of the Athletic call [...] "a rotten, snobbish, dull, expensive old hole--not one Good Mixer in the place--you couldn't hire me to join." [...] Statistics show that no member of the Athletic has ever refused election to the Union, and of those who are elected, sixty-seven per cent. resign from the Athletic and are thereafter heard to say, in the drowsy sanctity of the Union lounge, [...] "The Athletic would be a pretty good hotel, if it were more exclusive." ...|$|E

Nothing short of omniscience can divine what visions of the baker, or the green-grocer, or the smart and most insinuating butterman, are flitting across her mind—what thoughts of how she would dress on such an occasion, if she were a lady—of how she would dress, if she were only a bride—of how cook would dress, being bridesmaid, conjointly with her sister ‘in place’ at Fulham, and how the clergyman, deeming them so many ladies, would be quite humbled and respectful. What day-dreams of hope and happiness—of life being one perpetual holiday, with no master and no mistress to grant or withhold it—of every Sunday being a Sunday <b>out—of</b> pure freedom as to curls and ringlets, and no obligation to hide fine heads of hair in caps—what pictures of happiness, vast and immense to her, but utterly ridiculous to us, bewilder the brain of the little housemaid at number six, all called into existence by the wedding at the corner! ...|$|E
