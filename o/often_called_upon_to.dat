5|$|Benchley {{enrolled}} at Harvard University in 1908, again with Duryea's financial help. He joined the Delta Upsilon fraternity {{in his first}} year, and continued to partake in the camaraderie that he had enjoyed at Phillips Exeter while still doing well in school. He did especially well in his English and government classes. His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> entertain his fraternity brothers, and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular. His performances gave him some local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E
5|$|The American Pacific Northwest {{became a}} {{frequent}} site for {{games in the}} 1950s and 1960s. Western Canadian teams, particularly the BC Lions, were most <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> entertain their regional neighbours. News reports from the time suggest a hybrid game of three down Canadian ball played on the more restricted 100 yard American field. One BC–Winnipeg matchup in 1960 was held not {{on the west coast}} but in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, presumably because both teams had a number of former University of Iowa stars, including Willie Mitchell, who scored the Lions' only touchdown in a 13–7 loss in front of 12,583.|$|E
5|$|In 1874, Savage began {{a ten-year}} stay in San Francisco. He worked {{with his father}} and brother on an iron foundry enterprise, and served two years as colonel of the 2nd Regiment California National Guard. Savage took a {{prominent}} role in the civic and social life of the city, and was <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> make extemporaneous speeches to large crowds, a skill on which politician and economist Henry George complimented him. In January 1878, Savage served as chief military executive officer of the Committee of Safety, a group set up to oppose Denis Kearney and his riotous mob of angry supporters who {{wanted to get rid of}} Chinese immigrants. Savage's calm and logical presence was seen by San Franciscans as a rallying point for law and order during the riots. Savage renewed the friendship of his childhood schoolmate, now Bohemian Club poet Charles Warren Stoddard. He made the acquaintance of writer Archibald Clavering Gunter, who would later publish some of Savage's stories.|$|E

5|$|At the 1968 Republican National Convention, Agnew, who {{had earlier}} {{been asked to}} place Richard Nixon's name in nomination, was {{selected}} as running mate by Nixon and his campaign staff. Agnew's centrist reputation interested Nixon, and the law and order stance he had taken {{in the wake of}} civil unrest that year appealed to aides such as Pat Buchanan. Agnew made a number of gaffes during the campaign, but his rhetoric pleased many Republicans, and he may have made the difference in several key states. Nixon and Agnew defeated the Democratic ticket, incumbent vice president, Hubert Humphrey for president, and his running mate, Maine Senator Edmund Muskie. As vice president, Agnew was <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> attack the administration's enemies. In the years of his vice presidency, Agnew moved to the right, appealing to conservatives who were suspicious of moderate stances taken by Nixon. In 1972, Nixon and Agnew were reelected for a second term, defeating Senator George McGovern of South Dakota and former ambassador Sargent Shriver of Maryland.|$|E

50|$|Ko's {{compositions}} {{display a}} cosmopolitan blend of European and Asian timbres and techniques. He <b>often</b> <b>calls</b> <b>upon</b> performers <b>to</b> switch concepts {{within a single}} piece, sounding first like an instrument from nineteenth-century Austria and the next like an instrument from ancient Tibet. Compositions by Ko that have drawn particular acclaim include the Quintet II (1992) for chamber ensemble, The Crying Mermaid (1993) for orchestra, the imposing three-movement Dream of the Year 2000 for chorus and orchestra, and Overture to Taiwan's New Century (2003) for orchestra.|$|R
25|$|Beginning in 1860, {{as part of}} {{a much-needed}} {{beautification}} programme for the city, Emperor Dom Pedro II created several new parks, including a large grassed area in front of his daughter Princess Isabel's house, on Rua Paysandu in the Laranjeiras district. Due to good relations between the British community and the Brazilian monarchy, this space eventually became the country's first proper cricket ground, and hosted cricket, tennis and bowls matches for many years. Princess Isabel and her father were frequent spectators, and <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> present trophies to the winners.|$|E
25|$|A large, {{athletic}} dog, the Estrela Mountain Dog is {{a formidable}} opponent for any predator - fortunately, it is not <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> rise to anyone's life-or-death defense. It is calm but fearless and will not hesitate to react to danger, making it an exceptional watchdog {{as well as an}} excellent guard dog. It is intelligent, loyal, and faithful, affectionate to those it knows but wary of those it does not. It is instinctively protective of any children in its family. It needs early and continued socialization to be trustworthy around small pets and other dogs.|$|E
25|$|Albert Einstein {{was widely}} known during his {{lifetime}} for his work with the theory of relativity and physics in general. His political opinions were of public interest {{through the middle of}} the 20th century due to his fame and involvement in political, humanitarian and academic projects around the world. He was <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. Einstein's visible position in society allowed him to speak and write frankly, even provocatively, {{at a time when many}} people were silenced due to the rise of the Nazi movement.|$|E

25|$|Pierce {{is known}} for his {{distinctive}} voice and, like his Frasier co-star, Kelsey Grammer, is <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> provide voice work. His notable roles include the narrator of the movie The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human in 1999, walking stick insect Slim in A Bug's Life, Doctor Delbert Doppler in Disney's film Treasure Planet, and the amphibian Abe Sapien in Hellboy. Pierce refused credit for his Hellboy role because he felt it was the performance of Doug Jones, and not his own voice, which ultimately brought the character of Abe Sapien to life. He was the voice for Drix, a cold pill, in the animated comedy Osmosis Jones.|$|E
25|$|Each drum has a Lead Singer {{who runs}} {{his or her}} drum and leads the singers while singing.

Additionally, if a pow-wow has gourd dancing, the Southern Host Drum is often the drum that sings all the gourd songs, though another drum can perform them. The host drums are <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> sing special songs during the pow-wow.|$|E
25|$|Bromberg {{made his}} screen debut in 1936 under {{contract}} to Twentieth Century-Fox. The versatile actor played {{a wide variety of}} roles ranging from a ruthless New York newspaper editor (in Charlie Chan on Broadway) to a despotic Arabian sheik (in Mr. Moto Takes a Chance). Although he spoke with no trace of an accent, he was <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> play humble immigrants of various nationalities. When Warner Oland, the actor who played Charlie Chan, died in 1938, Fox considered J. Edward Bromberg as a suitable replacement, but the role ultimately went to Sidney Toler. Fox began loaning Bromberg to other studios in 1939 and finally dropped him from the roster in 1941. He kept working for various producers, including a stint at Universal Pictures in the mid-1940s.|$|E

25|$|In fact, barren mothers <b>often</b> <b>call</b> <b>upon</b> {{the spirit}} <b>to</b> cure their affliction. Many traditions hold that Mami Wata herself is barren, so if she gives a woman a child, that woman {{inherently}} becomes more distanced from the spirit's true nature. The woman will thus {{be less likely}} to become wealthy or attractive through her devotion to Mami Wata. Images of women with children often decorate shrines to the spirit.|$|R

500|$|Due to his immense {{popularity}} {{during his}} lifetime, Holmes was <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>upon</b> <b>to</b> produce commemorative poetry for specific occasions, including memorials, anniversaries and birthdays. Referring to this demand for his attention, he once {{wrote that he}} was [...] "a florist in verse, and what would people say / If I came to a banquet without my bouquet?" [...] As critic Hyatt Waggoner noted, however, [...] "very little... survives the occasions that produced it". Holmes became known as a poet who expressed the benefits of loyalty and trust at serious gatherings, {{as well as one}} who showed wit at festivities and celebrations. Edwin Percy Whipple for one considered Holmes to be [...] "a poet of sentiment and passion. Those who know him only as a comic lyricist, as the libellous laureate of chirping follow and presumptuous egotism, would be surprised at the clear sweetness and skylark thrill of his serious and sentimental compositions".|$|E
