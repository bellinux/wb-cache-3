It provided Hume, the employer of the great majority of the citizens of Gold Beach and Wedderburn, with a means of repossessing the wages of his employees and of profiting on the exchange.|$|E
5|$|Under {{continuing}} {{pressure from}} Raff, Edison eventually conceded {{to investigate the}} possibility of developing a projection system.

5|$|A concave line of {{abrasion}} {{and polishing}} {{can be found}} on both <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> kerb-stones on the western end of the monument and a kerb-stone on the south-east of the monument. These have been attributed to the sharpening of flint and other stone axe-blades on these sarsens. It is possible that these tools were sharpened for use in cutting and carving the timber levers and struts which would have been used in erecting the stones and constructing the tomb. Similar evidence for the sharpening of tools has been found at West Kennet Long Barrow, as well as later prehistoric monuments such as Stonehenge.|$|E
5|$|After Symeon's death his {{writings}} were kept alive by {{small groups of}} followers, eventually becoming <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> teachings of the hesychast movement. Many copies of his works {{were made in the}} following centuries, particularly around the 14th century, and among the Eastern Orthodox monasteries on Mt. Athos. His recognition has always been greater outside the official church, its calendar and liturgy. Historians credit this to his zealous personality, his criticism of the church hierarchy, his emphasis on direct experience of God, and some of his unorthodox teachings—including his belief that an unordained monk who had the direct experience of God was empowered to absolve others of their sins.|$|E
5|$|Bowerman and his athletes' {{philosophy}} and stories were documented by Kenny Moore. Moore {{wrote the book}} Bowerman and the Men of Oregon and practiced journalism, most notably for Sports Illustrated. He also was the screenwriter with Robert Towne for Without Limits, a movie that {{told the story of}} Prefontaine and Bowerman. In addition, he was also an actor in Personal Best, a movie with track and field as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> themes. Bowerman himself wrote several books on the sport of running including High Performance Training for Track and Field which details coaching instruction for high level competition. He also wrote a book with a cardiologist called Jogging, which detailed the medical benefits of jogging, to which many credited its exploding popularity. Bowerman's successor, Bill Dellinger, also authored a number of books regarding running, including Competitive Runner's Training Book, The Running Experience and Winning Running.|$|E

5|$|Dichlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7) is the {{anhydride}} of {{perchloric acid}} (HClO4) and can readily {{be obtained from}} it by dehydrating it with phosphoric acid at −10°C and then distilling the product at −35°C and 1mmHg. It is a shock-sensitive, colourless oily liquid. It is the least reactive of the chlorine oxides, being {{the only one to}} not set organic materials on fire at room temperature. It may be dissolved in water to regenerate perchloric acid or in aqueous alkalis to regenerate perchlorates. However, it thermally decomposes explosively by breaking <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> Cl–O bonds, producing the radicals ClO3 and ClO4 which immediately decompose to the elements through intermediate oxides.|$|E
5|$|Edward Duffy, an {{associate}} professor at Marquette University, says that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> characters of Chamber of Secrets is a book, Tom Riddle's enchanted diary, which takes control of Ginny Weasley – just as Riddle planned. Duffy suggests that Rowling intended this as a warning against passively consuming information from sources that have their own agendas. Although Bronwyn Williams and Amy Zenger regard the diary as more like an instant messaging or chat room system, they agree about the dangers of relying too much on the written word, which can camouflage the author, and they highlight a comical example, Lockhart's self-promoting books.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Gustav Nossal and Lederberg {{showed that}} one B cell always {{produces}} only one antibody, {{which was the}} first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. His theory predicted almost all of the key features of the immune system as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and somatic hypermutation as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding of the immune system as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation of the immune system when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.|$|E

5|$|The Skagen Painters were {{a close-knit}} group of mainly Danish artists who {{gathered}} each summer {{from the late}} 1870s in the fishing village of Skagen in the far north of Jutland, painting the local fishermen and their own family life and celebrations. Peder Severin Krøyer (1851–1909), {{who was born in}} Stavanger, Norway, but brought up in Copenhagen, first arrived in Skagen in 1882 and returned almost every summer. He had already gained a reputation for his paintings of the fishermen in Hornbæk on the north coast of Zealand and had been influenced by the Impressionist movement during his travels to France. In Skagen, he became <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> and most enthusiastic members of the artistic community.|$|E
5|$|The {{principle}} of individual freedom in society was already <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>central</b> {{points in the}} FPÖ (and VdU's) programme during the 1950s. The party did not regard its liberalism and its pan-German, nationalist positions as contradictory. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, the party developed economically, supporting tax reduction, less state intervention and more privatisation. Starting in the late 2000s, the party has taken a more populist tack, combining this position with support for the welfare state. It criticised unemployment and alleged welfare-state abuse by immigrants which, it said, threatened the welfare state and pensioners' benefits.|$|E
5|$|Born in Panama City to a poor mestizo family, Noriega {{studied at}} the Chorrillos Military School in Lima and at the School of the Americas. He became {{an officer in the}} Panamanian army, and rose through the ranks in {{alliance}} with Omar Torrijos. In 1968, Torrijos overthrew President Arnulfo Arias in a coup, establishing himself as leader; under Torrijos' government, Noriega became chief of military intelligence. After Torrijos' death in 1981, Noriega consolidated his power to become Panama's de facto ruler in 1983. From the 1950s until shortly before the U.S. invasion, Noriega worked with U.S. intelligence agencies. Noriega was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Central</b> Intelligence Agency's most valued intelligence sources, as well as one of the primary conduits for illicit weapons, military equipment and cash destined for U.S.-backed counter-insurgency forces throughout Latin America. The U.S. also regarded Noriega as an ally in its War on Drugs, despite Noriega himself having amassed a personal fortune through drug trafficking operations. Though his U.S. intelligence handlers were aware of this, it was allowed because of his usefulness to the U.S.|$|E
