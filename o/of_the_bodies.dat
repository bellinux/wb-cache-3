5|$|The {{bodies of}} those killed at Krečane were left unburied for two weeks. Some {{of the victims were}} not {{immediately}} killed, rather they took days to die and people living on the opposite bank of the Una River in Bosnia and Herzegovina claim that they heard cries for help for days after the killings took place. After two weeks, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> were bulldozed into a shallow grave {{on the bank of the}} river, and the rest thrown into the Una. The grave was located sufficiently close to the river to allow the current to wash at least some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> away.|$|E
5|$|At about 2:00p.m., the American {{military}} authorities, who {{had arrived}} in the city, ordered that the bodies be taken down and delivered to the city morgue for autopsies to be carried out.

5|$|Galileo {{observed}} the planet Saturn, {{and at first}} mistook its rings for planets, thinking it was a three-bodied system. When he {{observed the}} planet later, Saturn's rings were directly oriented at Earth, causing him to think that two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> had disappeared. The rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616, further confusing him.|$|E
5|$|In a draft {{resolution}} for the IAU definition of planet, both Pluto and Charon {{would have been}} considered dwarf planets in a binary system, given that they both satisfied the mass and shape requirements for dwarf planets and revolved around a common center of mass located between the two bodies (rather than within one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies).</b> The IAU currently states that Charon is not considered to be a dwarf planet and is just a satellite of Pluto, although the idea that Charon might qualify to be a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date. The location of the barycenter depends not only on the relative masses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies,</b> but also on the distance between them; the barycenter of the Sun–Jupiter orbit, for example, lies outside the Sun.|$|E

5|$|After being marched {{two miles}} north-west {{of the city}} centre, the victims {{encountered}} a barbed wire barrier and numerous Ukrainian police and German troops. Thirty or forty people at a time were told to leave their possessions and were escorted through a narrow passageway lined with soldiers brandishing clubs. Anyone who tried to escape was beaten. Soon the victims reached an open area, where {{they were forced to}} strip, and then were herded down into the ravine.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century, the BIPM had custody of two artefacts – one to define length and the other to define mass.

5|$|Bodies {{recovered}} were {{preserved and}} taken to Halifax, Nova Scotia, the closest city to the sinking with direct rail and steamship connections. A large temporary morgue {{was set up in}} a curling rink and undertakers were called in from all across Eastern Canada to assist. Relatives from across North America came to identify and claim the bodies of their relatives. Some bodies were shipped to be buried in their home towns across North America and Europe. About two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> were identified. Of the remaining 150 unclaimed bodies, 121 were taken to the non-denominational Fairview Lawn Cemetery; 19 were buried in the Roman Catholic Mount Olivet Cemetery, and 10 were taken to the Jewish Baron de Hirsch Cemetery. Unidentified victims were buried with simple numbers based on the order in which their bodies were discovered.|$|E
5|$|Built out {{of earth}} and around fifty local sarsen megaliths, the long barrow {{consisted}} of a sub-rectangular earthen tumulus enclosed by kerb-stones. Within {{the eastern end of}} the tumulus was a stone chamber, into which human remains were deposited on at least two separate occasions during the Early Neolithic. Osteoarchaeological analysis of these remains has shown them to be those of at least seventeen individuals, a mixture of men, women, children and adults. At least one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> had been dismembered before burial, potentially reflecting a funerary tradition of excarnation and secondary burial. As with other barrows, Coldrum has been interpreted as a tomb to house the remains of the dead, perhaps as part of a belief system involving ancestor veneration, although archaeologists have suggested that it may also have had further religious, ritual, and cultural connotations and uses.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> sense <b>of</b> {{embodiment}} {{is vital}} for self recognition. An examination of anosognosia for hemiplegia—the inability to recognise that one is paralysed down one side <b>of</b> one’s body—suggests <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> ‘online’ and ‘offline’ representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Online representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> are representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> as it is currently, are newly constructed moment by moment and are directly “plugged into” current perception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> In contrast, offline representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> are representations <b>of</b> what <b>the</b> <b>body</b> is usually like, are relatively stable and are constructed from online representations. This distinction is supported by an analysis of phantom limb—the feeling that an amputated limb is still present—phenomena. Initially it seems that <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> embodiment may arise from either {{of these types of}} representation; however, an integrated representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> seems to be required. It is suggested information from vision and emotions is involved in generating these representations. A lack of access to online representations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> does not necessarily lead to a loss in <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> embodiment. An integrated offline representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> could account for <b>the</b> sense <b>of</b> embodiment and perform the functions attributed to this sense. 15 page(s...|$|R

5|$|During {{the early}} history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, {{allowing}} elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans. However, because of the relatively small size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies,</b> the period of melting was necessarily brief (compared to the much larger planets), and had generally ended about 4.5billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation. In August 2007, a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from 4 Vesta suggested that it, and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt, had formed rather quickly, within ten million years of the Solar System's origin.|$|E

5|$|In 1943 {{the fragile}} {{relations}} between the Soviet Union and the Polish government-in-exile finally reached their breaking point when, on April 13, the Germans announced via the Katyn Commission the discovery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> of 20,000 Polish officers who had been murdered by the Soviets and buried in Katyn Forest, near Smolensk, Russia. Stalin claimed that the atrocity had been {{carried out by the}} Germans, while Nazi propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels successfully exploited the Katyn massacre to drive a wedge between Poland, the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, and subsequently Russia, did not acknowledge responsibility for this and similar massacres of Polish officers until the 1990s.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> term evocative <b>body</b> {{refers to}} a concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> introducing, {{defining}} and explaining <b>the</b> ‘evocative’ nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> in performance. It is a condition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> capable <b>of</b> evoking emotions, imagination and imageries in and between bodies. It is purely a performative organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> in a performance, oriented towards poetic reasons. It is magical and trance-formational. The paper will address some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> key issues in <b>the</b> conceptualization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> in recent theories <b>of</b> performance relocating <b>the</b> ‘evocative’ nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performer’s <b>body</b> within <b>the</b> wider debates <b>of</b> technique as knowledge. Socially and culturally, techniques become <b>the</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Techniques are restored in <b>the</b> <b>body</b> and transmitted physically and orally to other <b>bodies.</b> <b>The</b> learning and sharing of these techniques form <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> social codes of practice purely based on practical reasons. Drawing on two examples of practice such as Mudra (hand gestures) and Tattu-Marma, a relatively unknown martial art form <b>of</b> Kerala, <b>the</b> paper will ask the key question as what make <b>the</b> organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> in a performance different from <b>the</b> social organization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> and where do we draw {{the line between the}} ‘social’ and ‘performative’ in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> techniques...|$|R

5000|$|Skin {{wettedness}} {{is defined}} as [...] "the proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total skin surface area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> covered with sweat."The wetness of skin in different areas also affects perceived thermal comfort.

This is usually localized in different parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> and local thermal comfort limits for skin wettedness differ by locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> [...] <b>The</b> extremities are much more sensitive to thermal discomfort from wetness than <b>the</b> trunk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>body.</b> Although local thermal discomfort can be caused from wetness, <b>the</b> thermal comfort <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>body</b> will not be affected by <b>the</b> wetness <b>of</b> certain parts.|$|R
