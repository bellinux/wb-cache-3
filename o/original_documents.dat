5|$|On 18 February 2016, the INR in Warsaw {{announced}} it had seized {{a package of}} <b>original</b> <b>documents</b> that allegedly proved Wałęsa was a paid Communist informant. The documents dated from the period 1970–1976; they were seized from {{the home of a}} recently deceased former interior minister, General Czesław Kiszczak. The documents' authenticity was confirmed by an archival expert, but the prosecutors demanded a handwriting examination. Eventually, the requested examination concluded that the documents were authentic and, hence, Wałęsa had collaborated with the communist secret police.|$|E

The {{last of the}} major Belgrade museums is the Museum of Vuk and Dositej, which showcases the lives, work and legacy of Vuk Stefanović Karadžić and Dositej Obradović, the 19th century reformer of the Serbian literary language and the first Serbian Minister of Education, respectively. Belgrade also houses the Museum of African Art, founded in 1977, which has the large collection of art from West Africa.|$|E
5|$|At that point, a {{group of}} aristocrats persuaded the Despot Andronikos to seek the {{assistance}} of the Republic of Venice, an initiative probably taken without consulting Constantinople. In spring 1423, via the Venetian colony of Negroponte, he informed the Venetians of his intention. The only conditions Andronikos attached to his offer were that the property, customs and privileges of the city's inhabitants, their right to trade and come and go freely, and the position of the city's Orthodox Church, were respected, and that Venice would pledge to defend the city against the Ottomans. Pseudo-Sphrantzes claims that Andronikos sold the city for 50,000 ducats, and this statement was often accepted by more recent scholars until the mid-20th century. However, this is not mentioned by any other source, nor is it found in the <b>original</b> <b>documents</b> pertaining to the affair, as shown by the scholars Konstantinos Mertzios and Paul Lemerle. On the other hand, the Venetian envoys appointed to oversee the handover were authorised to provide a sum of between 20,000 and 40,000 aspers from the revenue of the city as a yearly subsidy to Andronikos, should he request it.|$|E
