5|$|Moorfields {{remained}} largely <b>open</b> <b>until</b> 1812, and the longstanding presence of that open space separating the emerging East End {{from the western}} urban expansion of London must have helped shape the varying economic character of the two parts and perceptions of their distinct identity (see map below).|$|E

5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area.

At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E

5|$|In Trondheim, the {{existing}} railway station for the Trondhjem–Støren Line was {{built as a}} cul-de-sac station at Kalvskinnet.

Thus the station became located next to the new port facility. With the construction of the Røros Line, it was decided to connect both lines to the same station. The cost of the new station was 1.4 million kroner. Trondheim Station did not <b>open</b> <b>until</b> 1882.|$|E
5|$|Many {{writers in}} the early 20th century perpetuated a myth that Thespis ran only a month and was {{considered}} a failure. In fact, it remained <b>open</b> <b>until</b> 8 March. Of the nine London pantomimes that appeared during the 1871–72 holiday season, five closed before Thespis did. By its nature, the genre did not lend itself to long runs, and all nine had closed {{by the end of}} March. Moreover, the Gaiety normally only ran productions for two or three weeks; the run of Thespis was extraordinary for the theatre.|$|E
5|$|Protracted {{negotiations}} over water rights with {{the owners of}} Saltford Brass Mill and around 30 other mills on the river between Bath and Bristol, delayed construction until 1809; the wheel was installed in March 1810.
