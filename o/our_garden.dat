2500|$|Dignity Village {{has been}} {{featured}} in articles in London's The Guardian, in The New York Times, and in other publications and media. The LA Times captured Tafari's vision for Dignity Village in a whimsical, idyllic quotation. [...] "Essentially, we will create housing for ourselves....The housing will be solar-powered, wind-driven. We'll eat from <b>our</b> <b>garden,</b> on our own table, and rest under our own fig trees when our labors are done." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1883, Robert Louis Stevenson came to Hyères and {{for about}} two years lived first at the Grand Hotel (the {{building}} still stands in the Avenue des Iles d'Or), and then in a chalet [...] called [...] Solitude in the present rue Victor-Basch. He wrote then: [...] "That spot <b>our</b> <b>garden</b> and our view are sub-celestial. I sing daily with Bunian, that great bard. I dwell next door to Heaven!" [...] In later years, he wrote from his retreat in Valima: [...] "Happy (said I); I was only happy once; that was at Hyères".|$|E
2500|$|The ship {{arrives in}} Venice, where the Carnival festival {{is taking place}} ("Money, Money, Money"). While the kings play {{roulette}} and baccarat, Candide searches for Cunegonde. Maximilian, revived once again, is now the corrupt Prefect of Police and the town's leader. Paquette is now the town's reigning prostitute. Cunegonde and the Old Lady are employed to encourage the gamblers ("What's the Use?"). Pangloss celebrates a victory after winning roulette and spends his money on the other ladies ("The Venice Gavotte"). Candide, however, masked for the Carnival, is accosted by Cunegonde and the Old Lady (both of whom are also masked), who try to swindle {{him out of his}} money. During the exchange, all the masks come off and they are horrified to recognize each other. [...] Seeing what Cunegonde has become, Candide's image of and belief in her is shattered ("Nothing More Than This"). Candide does not speak for several days; with what little money they have left, they purchase a small farm outside Venice and the chorus says that life is just life and paradise is nothing ("Universal Good"). Candide finally speaks and resolves to marry Cunegonde ("Make <b>Our</b> <b>Garden</b> Grow").|$|E

2500|$|After {{years of}} largely {{ignoring}} Broadway and traditional pop music {{in favor of}} more contemporary material, Streisand returned to her musical-theater roots with 1985's The Broadway Album, which was unexpectedly successful, holding the coveted No. 1 Billboard position for three straight weeks, and being certified quadruple platinum. The album featured tunes by Rodgers and Hammerstein, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, and Stephen Sondheim, who was persuaded to rework some of his songs especially for this recording. The Broadway Album was met with acclaim, including a Grammy nomination for album of the year and handed Streisand her eighth Grammy as Best Female Vocalist. After releasing the live album One Voice in 1986, Streisand was set to release another album of Broadway songs in 1988. She recorded several cuts for the album under the direction of Rupert Holmes, including [...] "On My Own" [...] (from Les Misérables), a medley of [...] "How Are Things in Glocca Morra?" [...] and [...] "Heather on the Hill" [...] (from Finian's Rainbow and Brigadoon, respectively), [...] "All I Ask of You" [...] (from The Phantom of the Opera), [...] "Warm All Over" [...] (from The Most Happy Fella) and an unusual solo version of [...] "Make <b>Our</b> <b>Garden</b> Grow" [...] (from Candide). Streisand was not happy with the direction of the project and it was scrapped. Only [...] "Warm All Over" [...] and a reworked, lite FM-friendly version of [...] "All I Ask of You" [...] were ever released, the latter appearing on Streisand's 1988 effort, Till I Loved You. At the beginning of the 1990s, Streisand started focusing on her film directorial efforts and became almost inactive in the recording studio. In 1991, a four-disc box set, Just for the Record, was released. A compilation spanning Streisand's entire career to date, it featured over 70 tracks of live performances, greatest hits, rarities and previously unreleased material.|$|E
