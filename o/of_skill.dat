40|$|PURPOSE: To {{examine the}} {{validity}} of a written knowledge test <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> for performance on an OSCE in postgraduate training for general practice. METHODS: A randomly-selected sample of 47 trainees in general practice took a knowledge test <b>of</b> <b>skills,</b> a general knowledge test and an OSCE. The OSCE included technical stations and stations including complete patient encounters. Each station was checklist rated and global rated. RESULTS: The knowledge test <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> was better correlated to the OSCE than the general knowledge test. Technical stations were better correlated to the knowledge test <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> than stations including complete patient encounters. For the technical stations the rating system had no influence on the correlation. For the stations including complete patient encounters the checklist rating correlated better to the knowledge test <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> than the global rating. CONCLUSION: The {{results of this study}} support the predictive validity of the knowledge test <b>of</b> <b>skills.</b> In postgraduate training for general practice a written knowledge test <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> can be used as an instrument to estimate the level <b>of</b> clinical <b>skills,</b> especially for group evaluation, such as in studies examining the efficacy of a training programme or as a screening instrument for deciding about courses to be offered. This estimation is more accurate when the content of the test matches the skills under study. However, written testing <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> cannot replace direct observation <b>of</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>skills...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a general equilibrium assignment model of workers to tasks with endogenous supply <b>of</b> <b>skills.</b> The model has 2 key features. First, skills are endogenous and multidimensional. Second, {{two types of}} assignment occur; workers self-select the type <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> to supply and firms assign workers to tasks/machines. Equilibrium is characterized by two functions mapping <b>skills</b> <b>of</b> each type to tasks and two wage functions, one for each type <b>of</b> <b>skills,</b> so that the wage distributions generally overlap. The model shows {{that the impact of}} any given skill-biased technical change on wage inequality is tightly related to the distribution <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> in the population. Productivity effects can be over or under estimated by wage data when the supply <b>of</b> <b>skills</b> is endogenous. The model also shows that Johnson's (1997) distinction between intensive and extensive technical change is impossible when supply is endogenous...|$|R

5|$|A delayed or {{deployable}} surface {{marker buoy}} (DSMB) is a soft inflatable tube which {{is attached to}} a reel or spool line at one end, and is inflated by the diver under water and released to float to the surface, deploying the line as it ascends.

The ratio of optimal capital to optimal demand <b>of</b> operational <b>skills,</b> the capital to direct labor ratio, increases with w^*, the price <b>of</b> <b>skills,</b> and decreases with the cost of capital, r.

5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle {{hunting and}} spear fishing patterns in a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains {{for the amount of}} time spent turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle hunting and spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle hunting and spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{have several}} {{different}} stats and gauges: their health (HP), a magic meter stocked by Technical Points (TP), and Learning Points (LP) for learning skills. a character's respective agility or luck, {{and how a}} character reacts to attacks. Attack types are physical and magical, while defense is limited to physical attacks. Characters gain experience levels through accumulating experience points (EXP). EXP and Gald is earned through battles, along with recovering a degree of TP and occasionally items dropped by defeated enemies. Skills, attributes that change different stats, can be assigned to each character. The number of skills that can be assigned is calculated by the number <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> points each character has available. Battling with equipment associated with a particular skill enables that character to learn it when they have filled their LP meter. Cooking, creating meals with ingredients found in battle or around explored environments, {{can also be used}} by individual characters to restore their HP and TP and grant temporary enhancements. Recipes are learned from a character called the Wonder Chef.|$|E

5|$|Daily fantasy {{sports have}} faced notable legal challenges, {{including}} disputes over whether DFS constitutes gambling. Politicians {{and other critics}} have argued that due to their format, players are essentially making proposition wagers on the varying performance of individual athletes in specific games, and not managing {{the performance of their}} selections on a week-to-week basis. Proponents have defended DFS as being a game <b>of</b> <b>skill,</b> as the required familiarity with the players and teams, as well as salary cap management, rewards skilled players.

5|$|Dances can be {{performed}} solo (1, 4); in pairs, (2, 3); in groups, (5, 6, 7); or by massed performers (10). They might be improvised (4, 8) or highly choreographed (1, 2, 5, 10); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, (4); a paying audience (2); a world audience (10); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre (3, 5). They might {{be a part of}} a celebration, such as a wedding or New Year (6, 8); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by warriors like a haka (7).

5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes the skis to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a different level <b>of</b> <b>skill</b> in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), and it can be difficult for them to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E
