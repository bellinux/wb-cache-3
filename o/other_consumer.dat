Prices could be 650 percent higher than in legal shops and rose constantly during the war. Because of the profits to be made, the black market spawned large and well-organised networks. Numerous members of the German administration were involved in the black market, stealing military or official supplies and reselling them.|$|E

In addition, this study proposed that situational salience of <b>other</b> <b>consumers</b> in a service encounter has a moderating effect on consumer responses. In two service contexts, this study provided {{strong support for}} the dual-process model and for the moderating effect of situational salience of <b>other</b> <b>consumers</b> on consumer responses. Implications for the emerging influence-of-other-consumers literature and hospitality service management were also discussed...|$|R

In some cases, when a company changes their prices, that decision attracts <b>other</b> <b>consumers</b> that, at the same time, attract more consumers and so on.

The performance increase of the fourth-generation iPad varies between tests, however an increase is nonetheless evident.

5|$|For {{the next}} few years, the new regime optimistically engaged in reform and {{experimentation}} {{and for the first}} time many Poles could afford to buy cars, televisions and <b>other</b> <b>consumer</b> goods. The authorities made sure that the workers received proper wages. The peasants had their compulsory deliveries abolished, were paid higher prices for their products and free health service was finally extended to rural, self-employed Poland. The intellectuals had censorship eased and Poles were able to travel to the West and maintain foreign contacts with little difficulty. Relations with the Polish emigrant communities were strengthened. There was some cultural and political relaxation and an improved freedom of speech environment, exercised for example by the respected weekly Polityka of the Polish party. Massive investments were made, expected to both improve the standard of living of the various segments of society and establish an internationally competitive Polish industry and agriculture, based on purchases of Western technology. The modernized manufacturing would result in a vastly expanded export of Polish-made products to the West, which in turn would generate hard currency to pay-off the debts.|$|E
40|$|Social {{networking}} {{sites are}} a major networking tool for consumer interactions as they provide a platform for communication, socialization, and learning activity. Subsequently, social media has become an important marketing tool for advertising companies’ messages. As a result, fashion brands such as H&M and Victoria’s Secret started to show more brand ads on Facebook. Facebook {{is one of the}} most powerful social networking sties due to its ability to reach to broad consumer groups through a brand page. However, research regarding this topic is limited as the social networking sites is relatively a new phenomenon. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to examine the effect of the brand’s comments in attenuating (enhancing) negative (positive) influence of <b>other</b> <b>consumer’s</b> postings on brand trust and purchase intention of <b>other</b> <b>consumer’s</b> postings on social media. Findings from this study revealed that there is no moderating effect of brand comments of the relationship between <b>other</b> <b>consumer’s</b> postings and brand trust, while positive <b>other</b> <b>consumer’s</b> postings has a significant effect on consumers’ brand trust. Also, there were no significant differences among <b>other</b> <b>consumer’s</b> postings, brand comments and purchase intention relationships. These findings add to the previous literature explains that brand should interact with consumers frequently in order to induce positive <b>other</b> <b>consumer’s</b> postings to develop brand trust. By using the consumer socialization theory to investigate Facebook marketing, this study provides insights and information on consumer attitudes and behaviors related to Facebook brand page...|$|R
