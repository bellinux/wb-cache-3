Phosphoric acid and aluminum hydroxide react readily but alumina and phosphoric acid are only slowly reactive at ordinary temperature. When temperature rises, phosphoric acid undergoes dehydration and reacts with alumina to form mono aluminum phosphate, which starts above 127 [*]°C and continues till 427 [*]°C. Between 732 and 1327 [*]°C, aluminum orthophosphate is formed. Aluminum orthophosphate resembles silica in structure. It corresponds to quartz to form berlinite; it has ortho-polymorphs of cristobalite and tridymite forms (Schacht 2004, Sahnoun and Bouaziz 2012, and Luza et al. 2015).
