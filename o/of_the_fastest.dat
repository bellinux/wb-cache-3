Second goal is to discover if there is a link between effectivness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> break (or portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> breaks from <b>the</b> total <b>of</b> breaks) and final place scored on the previously mentioned tournaments. Methods: Statistic analysis, ratio of <b>fast</b> breaks, comparism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ratios Results: It was discovered, the teams with greater efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> breaks took better places, in <b>the</b> sample <b>of</b> <b>the</b> reaserched tournaments, than the teams with lesser efficiency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> breaks.

40|$|Two {{modes of}} {{flexural}} waves {{can be generated}} by a dipole source in an anisotropic borehole. Their velocities are related to those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> and slow shear waves in the formation. The particle motions and <b>the</b> polarization diagrams <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> and slow flexural waves are measured in borehole models made of phenolite materials with transverse isotropy or orthorhombic anisotropy. The experimental results show that <b>the</b> particle motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> flexural wave is linear {{and in the same}} direction as that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> shear wave in the formation. <b>The</b> polarization direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> flexural wave coincides with that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> shear wave and is independent ofthe direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dipole source. <b>The</b> particle motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slow flexural wave is nonlinear and elliptic. Its polarization direction and variation are dependent on the anisotropic material and the source direction. This means that the slow flexural wave is a more complicated wave mode rather than the simple mode where the particle motion generated by a dipole source is in <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> slow shear wave. <b>The</b> polarization characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> flexural wave can be applied to determine <b>the</b> principal axis <b>of</b> an anisotropic formation by in-line and cross-line logging data.

40|$|Here {{we present}} an {{in-depth}} study <b>of</b> <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Folding Algorithm, an alternative pulsar searching technique to <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Fourier Transform. Weaknesses in <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Fourier Transform, including a susceptibility to red noise, leave it insensitive to pulsars with long rotational periods (P > 1 s). This sensitivity gap {{has the potential}} to bias our understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> period distribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pulsar population. <b>The</b> <b>Fast</b> Folding Algorithm, a time-domain based pulsar searching technique, {{has the potential to}} overcome some of these biases. Modern distributed-computing frameworks now allow for <b>the</b> application <b>of</b> this algorithm to all-sky blind pulsar surveys for the first time. However, many aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> this search technique remain poorly understood, including its responsiveness to variations in pulse shape and <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> red noise. Using a custom CPU-based implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Folding Algorithm, ffancy, we have conducted an in-depth study into <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Folding Algorithm in both an ideal, white noise regime as well as a trial on observational data from the HTRU-S Low Latitude pulsar survey, including a comparison to <b>the</b> behaviour <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fast</b> Fourier Transform.

The ratio {{is based upon the}} photo ionisation cross-sections <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> and medium components and <b>the</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measurement equipment used to record the OSL signal, and it compares parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> OSL signal selected to represent <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> and medium components. <b>The</b> ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> ratio to distinguish between samples whose CW-OSL signal is dominated by <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> and non-fast components is demonstrated by comparing <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> ratio with <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> component calculated from curve deconvolution of measured OSL signals and from simulated data.
