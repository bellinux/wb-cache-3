25|$|It is {{said that}} {{the action of the}} Supreme Court of Illinois is {{contrary}} to the principles of that portion of the First Amendment which guarantees the free exercise of religion. Of course, under <b>our</b> <b>Constitutional</b> system, men could not be excluded from the practice of law, or indeed from following any other calling, simply because they belong to any of our religious groups, whether Protestant, Catholic, Quaker, or Jewish, assuming it conceivable that any state of the Union would draw such a religious line. We cannot say that any such purpose to discriminate motivated the action of the Illinois Supreme Court.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{believe that}} a state statute would be {{consistent}} with <b>our</b> <b>constitutional</b> guarantee of freedom of religion if it specifically denied the right to practice law to all members of one of our great religious groups, Protestant, Catholic, or Jewish. Yet the Quakers have had a long and honorable part in the growth of our nation, and an amicus curiae brief filed in their behalf informs us that, under the test applied to this petitioner, not one of them, if true to the tenets of their faith, could qualify for the bar in Illinois. And {{it is obvious that the}} same disqualification would exist as to every conscientious objector to the use of force, even though the Congress of the United States should continue its practice of absolving them from military service. The conclusion seems to me inescapable that, if Illinois can bar this petitioner from the practice of law it can bar every person from every public occupation solely because he believes in nonresistance, rather than in force.|$|E

When the terms for the commission's visit were presented to Smith, he found that contrary to what had been discussed during the British Prime Minister's visit, the Royal Commission would operate {{on the basis that}} the 1961 constitution was unacceptable to the British government, and that Britain would not commit itself to accepting the final report.

500|$|However, in Yong Vui Kong v. Public Prosecutor (2010) the Court of Appeal {{appeared}} to reject {{such an approach}} by declining to require that procedural laws must be [...] "fair, just and reasonable" [...] {{before they can be}} regarded as law for the purpose of Article 9(1). It noted that the provision neither contains such a qualification, nor can such a qualification be implied from its context or wording. The Court considered it [...] "too vague a test of constitutionality" [...] and said: [...] "Such a test hinges on the court’s view of the reasonableness of the law in question, and requires the court to intrude into the legislative sphere of Parliament as well as engage in policy making." [...] On the other hand, the Court acknowledged that Article 9(1) does not justify all legislation whatever its nature. It held, obiter, that law might not encompass [...] legislation (that is, bills of attainder – legislation purporting to be of general application but in fact directed at securing the conviction of particular individuals), or legislation [...] "of so absurd or arbitrary a nature that it could not possibly have been contemplated by <b>our</b> <b>constitutional</b> framers as being 'law' when they crafted the constitutional provisions protecting fundamental liberties".|$|E

500|$|New {{elections}} {{had to be}} {{held for}} burgess and for delegate to the convention which had been called by the rump of the dissolved House of Burgesses, and Fairfax County's were set for July 5, 1774. Washington planned to run for one seat, and tried to get Mason or Bryan Fairfax to seek the other, but both men declined. Although the poll was postponed to the 14th due to poor weather, Washington met that day with other local leaders (including, likely, Mason) in Alexandria and selected a committee to draft a set of resolutions, which Washington hoped would [...] "define <b>our</b> <b>Constitutional</b> Rights". The resulting Fairfax Resolves were largely drafted by Mason. He met with the newly elected Washington on July 17 at Mount Vernon, and stayed the night; the two men rode together to Alexandria the following day. The 24 propositions that made up the Resolves protested loyalty to the British Crown, but denied the right of Parliament to legislate for colonies that had been settled at private expense and which had received charters from the monarch. The Resolves called for a continental congress. If Americans did not receive redress by November 1, exports, including that of tobacco, would be cut off. The freeholders of Fairfax County approved the Resolves, appointing Mason and Washington to a special committee in the emergency. According to early Virginia historian Hugh Grigsby, at Alexandria, Mason [...] "made his first great movement on the theatre of the Revolution".|$|E
