5|$|In 1971, the Port of Karachi {{housed the}} {{headquarters}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> Navy and {{almost the entire}} Pakistan Naval fleet was based at Karachi Harbour. It is also the hub of Pakistan's maritime trade, meaning that a blockade would be disastrous for Pakistan’s economy. The defence of Karachi harbour was therefore paramount to the Pakistani High Command and it was heavily defended against any air or naval strikes, including cover from strike aircraft based at two airfields in the area.|$|E
5|$|The first {{sport to}} {{interest}} Bolt was cricket, {{and he said}} {{if he was not}} a sprinter, he would be a fast bowler instead. As a child, he was a supporter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> cricket team and admired the bowling of Waqar Younis. He is also a fan of Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar, West Indian opener Chris Gayle, and Australian opener Matthew Hayden. During a charity cricket match, Bolt clean-bowled Gayle who was complimentary of Bolt's pace and swing. Bolt also struck a six off Gayle's bowling. Another bowler complimentary of Bolt's pace was former West Indies fast-bowling great Curtly Ambrose.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qaeda {{confirmed}} the death on May 6 with posts made on militant websites, vowing to avenge the killing. Other Pakistani militant groups, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, vowed retaliation against the U.S. and against Pakistan for not preventing the operation. The raid {{was supported by}} over 90% of the American public, was welcomed by the United Nations, NATO, the European Union {{and a large number}} of governments, but was condemned by others, including two-thirds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> public. Legal and ethical aspects of the killing, such as his not being taken alive despite being unarmed, were questioned by others, including Amnesty International. Also controversial was the decision not to release any photographic or DNA evidence of bin Laden's death to the public.|$|E

5|$|On 4 January 2011, at Kohsar Market of Islamabad, the {{governor}} of Punjab, Salmaan Taseer, was assassinated by Malik Mumtaz Hussein Qadri, a 26-year-old member of his security team, because of his defence of Noreen and opposition to the blasphemy law. (Mumtaz Qadri {{was sentenced to death}} for the assassination and hanged on 29 February 2016.) Taseer was outspoken in his criticism of the law and the verdict in Noreen's case. The next day, thousands turned up for {{the governor}}'s funeral in Lahore in spite of warnings by the Taliban and some clerics, while a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> population also praised Qadri as a hero; thousands of Sunni Muslims rallied in support of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan after the murder, and 500 Barelvi clerics prohibited their followers from sending condolences to the family of Taseer. This resulted in concerns that the public was becoming tolerant of extremists.|$|E
5|$|Peace {{negotiations}} with the Taliban were announced by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after his election, although previous attempts to engage TTP in dialogue had failed. The first session of talks, between committees appointed by the Pakistani Government and the Taliban, was held on 26 March 2014 at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House in Islamabad. The Taliban did not name representatives from their ranks, instead nominating pro-Taliban religious figures to present their views. The terrorists called {{for the implementation of}} Sharia in Pakistan; the Government of Pakistan demanded the cessation of hostilities, insisting that talks be held within the framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> constitution. A month-long ceasefire was reached on 1 March 2014.|$|E
5|$|Since January 2006, Lal Masjid and the {{adjacent}} Jamia Hafsa madrasah had been operated by Islamic militants led by two brothers, Abdul Aziz and Abdul Rashid. This organisation advocated {{the imposition of}} Sharia (Islamic religious law) in Pakistan and openly called for the overthrow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> government. Lal Masjid was in constant conflict with authorities in Islamabad for 18 {{months prior to the}} military operation. They engaged in violent demonstrations, destruction of property, kidnapping, arson and armed clashes with the authorities. After Lal Masjid militants set fire to the Ministry of Environment building and attacked the Army Rangers who guarded it, the military responded, and the siege of the Lal Masjid complex began.|$|E

5|$|The 1888 {{session of}} the Indian National Congress {{was held in the}} city, and {{by the turn of the}} 20th century Allahabad was a revolutionary centre. Nityanand Chatterji became a {{household}} name when he hurled a bomb at a European club. In Alfred Park in 1931, Chandrashekhar Azad died when surrounded by British police. The Nehru family homes, Anand Bhavan and Swaraj Bhavan, were centres of Indian National Congress activity. During the years before independence Allahabad was home to thousands of satyagrahis led by Purushottam Das Tandon, Bishambhar Nath Pande, Narayan Dutt Tiwari and others. The first seeds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> nation were sown in Allahabad. On 29 December 1930, Allama Muhammad Iqbal's presidential address to the All-India Muslim League proposed a separate Muslim state for the Muslim-majority regions of India.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{spent three}} months in Pakistan during early 1949, where he was engaged in organising the fledgling Pakistani Archaeological Department {{with the aid of}} former members of the Archaeological Survey and new {{students}} whom he recruited. The Minister of Education, Fazlur Rahman, was sympathetic to Wheeler's plans, and the government agreed to establish a National Museum of Pakistan in Karachi, which opened in April 1950. Wheeler himself was appointed the first President <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> Museums Association, and found himself as a mediator in the arguments between India and Pakistan over the redistribution of archaeological and historic artefacts following the partition. He also wrote a work of archaeological propaganda for the newly formed state, Five Thousand Years of Pakistan (1950).|$|E
5|$|When an Indian American {{passenger}} reveals {{himself as}} an American, one of the terrorists murders him and throws his body off the aircraft in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pakistani</b> negotiators. The terrorists try to locate a radio engineer among the passengers by ordering Neerja to make an announcement over the intercom. When Emran Ali (Shashi Bhushan), a Pakistani radio engineer, begins to stand up, Neerja signals for him to sit down. The terrorists have the flight attendants collect all passports to identify the American passengers and hold them hostage; Neerja and her colleagues collect the passports, disposing of any American passports by throwing them down trash chutes or hiding them under seats. Dejected over not finding any American passports, the hijackers locate a British passenger and hold him hostage.|$|E
