50|$|Rotaprint was {{a company}} {{manufacturing}} <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> printing presses located in Berlin, Germany from 1904 to 1989. At {{the height of}} its activities it employed about 1,000 workers {{making it one of}} the largest employers in the Wedding district of Berlin.|$|R
5000|$|UK notes include raised print (e.g. on {{the words}} [...] "Bank of England"); watermarks; {{embedded}} metallic thread; holograms; and fluorescent ink visible only under UV lamps. Three printing techniques are involved: <b>offset</b> <b>litho,</b> intaglio and letterpress; and the notes incorporate a total of 85 specialized inks.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} types of paste inks {{available}} for utilization in offset lithographic printing and each have their own advantages and disadvantages. These include heat-set, cold-set, and energy-curable (or EC), such as ultraviolet- (or UV-) curable, and electron beam- (or EB-) curable. Heat-set inks {{are the most common}} variety and are [...] "set" [...] by applying heat and then rapid cooling to catalyze the curing process. They are used in magazines, catalogs, and inserts. Cold-set inks are set simply by absorption into non-coated stocks and are generally used for newspapers and books but are also found in insert printing and are the most economical option. Energy-curable inks are the highest-quality <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> inks and are set by application of light energy. They require specialized equipment such as inter-station curing lamps, and are usually the most expensive type of <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> ink.|$|R
50|$|RomaPrint, a {{division}} of Ro-Marong Nigeria handles all <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> print and soft packaging. It {{is one of the}} biggest in Nigeria today and it is under European Norms. It is equipped with the latest printing presses which are all imported from Europe. It mostly prints for product packaging and labelling for pharmaceutical products, soap, bottles and cereals.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, the {{production}} of Action Transfers was transferred to Letraset's Italian factory, Sodecor, where <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> printing was used with transfers for the first time. The impetus for the move was a joint venture undertaken with Gillette to produce Action Transfers under the name Kalkitos. These were widely distributed around the world, with the brand name occasionally differing; in the US, they were known as PrestoMagiX.|$|R
5000|$|No {{official}} paper industry standard defines glossy, semi-matte, etcetera, though an objective scale {{is available for}} the glossiness of papers used in <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> printing. Hewlett-Packard, Epson and Kodak all use their own terms to describe their paper, such as Everyday (HP), Premium High Gloss and Luster (Epson) and Ultima (Kodak). ECI (www.eci.org) has categorized papers for proofing simulation of litho papers (type1/2 etc.) ...|$|R
2500|$|HP {{provides}} the option for users to mix their own ink colors to match Pantone references. This is common with non-digital <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> presses, {{and is one}} of the features that distinguishes the HP Indigo process. [...] "Off-press" [...] colors are mixed from 11 color (from the 15 original) Pantone spectrum at an offline, ink mixing station. Users can also order special pre-mixed colors from HP Indigo, for example fluorescent pink. [...] HP Indigo presses are available in configurations supporting four, five, six or seven colors.|$|R
50|$|Anti-set-off {{spray powder}} is {{generally}} made from natural starches from plants and vegetables. There remains {{a demand for}} soluble powders (sometimes known as vanished powders) based on natural sugars which are often used when the final printed sheet is to be varnished. In addition {{there is still a}} relatively small amount of powder made from minerals (e.g. Calcium Carbonate, rather than Talc) used in <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> printing; however these mineral powders are not so popular because of the potential health implications and abrasive properties.|$|R
5000|$|As in <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> {{printing}} and traditional photographic printing, glossy papers give the highest color density (or Dmax), {{and therefore the}} widest color gamut. Photo papers vary in their longevity and their color gamut. Ink suppliers often provide color profiles for their ink systems when used with specific papers. Longevity depends on the specific combination of inks and paper. For maximum life, the paper substrate is [...] "wood-free" [...] (i.e., wood-based but without lignin), or cotton-based, {{or a combination of}} the two. Plastic substrates also exist.|$|R

50|$|Despite the {{widespread}} use of the <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> printing process elsewhere, the Murdoch papers, in common with the rest of Fleet Street, continued to be produced by the labour-intensive hot-metal linotype method, rather than being composed electronically. Eddie Shah's Messenger Group, in a long-running and bitter dispute at Warrington, had benefited from the Thatcher government's trade union legislation which allowed employers to de-recognise unions, enabling the Messenger Group to use an alternative workforce and new technology in newspaper production. Journalists could input copy directly, which reduced the need for labour in the print halls, cut costs and shortened production time dramatically.|$|R
50|$|The Abraham Moss {{opened in}} 1973 as a {{multipurpose}} integrated centre with lower school, and upper school seamlessly joining to a FE college, a library and a leisure centre. The first principal was Ron Mitson, with Dave Shapcott being head of school. It aimed to teach through independent resource-based learning- staff developed and pasted {{up their own}} materials which were then taken to the printroom, where the masters were allocated an accession number and the printroom staff would print the required number of copies on <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> machines. It {{was referred to as}} a school without books. The building was featured in a DES best practice building report.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1950s and 1960s {{the most}} popular comic {{magazine}} for older age-group boys was the Eagle published by Hulton Press. The Eagle was published in a more expensive format, and was a gravure-printed weekly. This format was one used originally by Mickey Mouse Weekly during the 1930s. The Eagles success saw a number of comics launched in a similar format, TV Century 21, Look and Learn and TV Comic being notable examples. Comics published in this format were known in the trade as [...] "slicks". At {{the end of the}} 1960s these comics moved away from gravure printing, preferring <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> due to cost considerations arising from decreasing readership.|$|R
50|$|Acid-based {{fountain}} {{solutions are}} still the most common variety and yield the best quality results by means of superior protection of the printing plate, lower dot gains, and longer plate life. Acids are also the most versatile; capable of running with all types of <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> inks. However, because these products require more active ingredients to run well than do neutrals and alkalines, {{they are also the}} most expensive to produce. However, neutrals and, to a lesser degree, alkalines are still an industry staple {{and will continue to be}} used for most newspapers and many lower-quality inserts. In recent years alternatives have been developed which do not use fountain solutions at all (waterless printing).|$|R
40|$|This artist's {{newspaper}} {{is composed of}} articles, texts and images that have grown from a dialogue between the artist Melanie Jackson and the writer Esther Leslie. It takes Goethe's notion of the Urpflanze as a starting point: an idea of plant form that had all future plants coiled up inside it. The Ur-form or Ur-phenomenon, {{is an effort to}} think through the relations between polar opposites, form and metamorphosis, nature and history, simultaneity and succession. The Urpflanze projects forward from its origins whole worlds that are yet to come. The publication is supplied in a limited edition of 100 in a screenprinted archival box also containing a unique <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> 'make ready' print version signed by the artist...|$|R
50|$|As {{technology}} developed, so did fanzines. A {{move from}} photocopying to <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> printing {{in the early}} 1980s allowed the bigger selling fanzines to improve print quality, although lower-circulation titles continued to use photocopying for many years after this. Bath-based Skaro {{was one of the}} first fanzines to be professionally typeset, but that was virtually the exception as this was such an expensive process. The 1970s-80s fanzines were all produced well before modern, affordable, home computers with crisp laser printers made the revolution that was desktop publishing. Most were produced under difficult conditions, and early editors had to do everything by hand, all their own typing, with no spell check, meaning correcting mistakes was a nightmare, and final lay out could take days, if not weeks.|$|R
50|$|Fred’s {{daughter}} Marjorie {{inherited the}} company, which was kept {{going through the}} quiet years of the 1950s mainly by the efforts of Ernest Bartholomew. The first 200 of the “C” series are older negatives with colour applied and printed on a rotaprint machine from about 1954. The first postmarked date of a “C” series card recorded is April, 1957. Again new investment in a German colour printing machine in 1960 and an <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> machine in 1964 led to a rise in fortunes for the company. The main series of now sepia tone and black and white cards was continued with the colour series running alongside {{for a number of}} years. Evidence for this {{can be seen in the}} images of 30770 and C350, (30770 and C350 Pony Trekkers Elan Valley) which were clearly both taken on the same date about 1966.|$|R
50|$|Letterpress is {{considered}} a craft as it involves using a skill and is done by hand. Fine letterpress work is crisper than <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> because of its impression into the paper, giving greater visual definition to the type and artwork, {{although it is not}} what letterpress traditionally was meant for. Today, many of these small letterpress shops survive by printing fine editions of books or by printing upscale invitations, stationery, and greeting cards. These methods often use presses that require the press operator to feed paper one sheet at a time by hand. Today, the juxtaposition of this technique and offbeat humor for greeting cards has been proven by letterpress shops to be marketable to independent boutiques and gift shops. Some of these printmakers are just as likely to use new printing methods as old, for instance by printing using photopolymer plates on restored vintage presses.|$|R
50|$|In 1970 the Arts Lab {{obtained}} an <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> {{press on}} loan from a local cash and carry operation (in return for printing the company's price list for free) and in 1972 bought a second hand press of its own. Initially intended to print flyers and price lists on a commercial basis, the take-over of the printing operation by Hunt Emerson in 1974 saw the Arts Lab move into comic art, producing a series of publications under its own Ar:Zak imprint. Starting with Emerson's own Large Cow Comix - which also featured work by Kevin O'Neill and Bryan Talbot - and eventually branching out such varied publications as Steve Bell's Big Foot; David Edgar's anti-Nazi Committed Comix and Suzy Varty's Heroine (the first British women's comic), Ar:Zak was to become {{an important part of}} the history of underground British comics, a position reinforced when the Arts Lab held KAK - the first Konvention of Alternative Komix in 1976.|$|R
50|$|Apart from {{publications}} such as IT and Oz, both {{of which}} had a national circulation, the 1960s and 1970s saw {{the emergence of a}} whole range of local alternative newspapers, which were usually published monthly. These were largely made possible by the introduction in the 1950s of <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> printing, which was much cheaper than traditional typesetting and use of the rotary letterpress. Such local papers included Aberdeen Peoples Press, Alarm (Swansea), Andersonstown News (Belfast), Brighton Voice, Bristol Voice, Feedback (Norwich), Hackney People's Press, Islington Gutter Press, Leeds Other Paper, Response (Earl's Court, London), Sheffield Free Press, and the West Highland Free Press. A 1980 review identified some 70 such publications around the United Kingdom but estimated that the true number could well have run into hundreds. Such papers were usually published anonymously, for fear of the UK's draconian libel laws. They followed a broad anarchist, libertarian, left-wing of the Labour Party, socialist approach but the philosophy of a paper was usually flexible as those responsible for its production came and went. Most papers were run on collective principles.|$|R
50|$|Artists {{generally}} use {{inkjet printing}} to make reproductions {{of their original}} two-dimensional artwork, photographs, or computer-generated art. Professionally produced inkjet prints are much more expensive on a per-print basis than the four-color offset lithography process traditionally used for such reproductions. (A large-format inkjet print can cost more than $50, not including scanning and color correction, compared to $5 for a four-color <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> print of the same image in a run of 1,000.) Four-color offset lithographic presses have the disadvantage of the full job having {{to be set up}} and produced all at once in a mass edition. With inkjet printing the artist does not {{have to pay for the}} expensive printing plate setup or the marketing and storage needed for large four-color offset print runs. This allows the artist to follow a just-in-time business model in which inkjet printing can be an economical option, since art can be printed and sold individually in accordance with demand. Inkjet printing has the added advantage of allowing artists to take total control of the production of their images, including the final color correction and the substrates being used, and it is even feasible for individual artists to own and operate their own printers.|$|R

50|$|The Wapping dispute was a {{significant}} {{turning point in the}} history of the trade union movement and of UK industrial relations. It started on 24 January 1986 when some 6,000 newspaper workers went on strike after protracted negotiation with their employers, News International (parent of Times Newspapers and News Group Newspapers, and chaired by Rupert Murdoch). News International had built and clandestinely equipped a new printing plant for all its titles in the London district of Wapping, and when the print unions announced a strike it activated this new plant with the assistance of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union (EETPU). Despite the widespread use of the <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> printing process elsewhere, the Murdoch papers in common with the rest of Fleet Street continued to be produced by the hot-metal and labour-intensive Linotype method, rather than being composed electronically. Eddy Shah's Messenger group, in a long-running and bitter dispute at Warrington had benefited from the Thatcher government's trade union legislation to allow employers to de-recognise unions, enabling the company to use an alternative workforce and new technology in newspaper production. He launched Today on Tuesday 4 March 1986, as a middle-market tabloid, a rival to the long-established Daily Mail and Daily Express. It pioneered computer photosetting and full-colour offset printing at a time when national newspapers were still using Linotype machines and letterpress. Established national newspapers converted to electronic production and colour printing. Today ceased publication on 17 November 1995, the first long-running national newspaper title to close since the Daily Sketch in 1971.|$|R
40|$|A sole {{authored}} artists book {{consisting of}} 72 pages, 32 photographs and 10 illustrations with English and traditional Chinese text, {{based on a}} transcribed folk-tale by Victorian folklorist and writer Marie Clothilde Balfour. One of the projects most distinctive elements will be the conception of the book as 'object', creating a seamless fusion of image, typography, story and folk-tale. The book itself literally becomes a unique 'adaptation' and re-staging and is intended to draw parallels and connections between concepts of artifice, history and myth. The project also draws together some of the special sensations of 'vision in the dark', along {{with a sense of}} the macabre and the uncanny, that has been identified in the original short story. This {{is the first time in}} over a hundred years that the story in its original form, in Cambridge University Library Archives, has been published. Along with the original text in a Victorian English dialect, the story will be translated and printed in Chinese using traditional calligraphic characters, and in an 'adapted' contemporary English dialect version. The book will be designed around the artist's photographs and video stills that will function as 'illustrations', creating an 'expanded' fusion of the western and eastern traditions of the 'photo/graphic-novel'. Several of its unique and most distinctive features will be the innovative use of conventional <b>offset</b> <b>litho</b> and silkscreen printing on uniquely commissioned materials, text and image which are 'overwritten', through translation and difficult to read transcription in regional dialect and photographs through the use of low resolution image capture, where text and image become temporarily stripped of both linguistic and descriptive function...|$|R
2500|$|These {{types of}} {{envelopes}} are mostly used for domestic postage. Until 1978, a simple {{design and size}} introduced by the British in the 1890s, was used. In 2001, new larger, 4 colour <b>litho</b> <b>offset</b> envelopes were issued. These provided both, the Post Office and commercial companies, an avenue for advertising. The first envelope was issued on 1 August 2001 and featured the Quaid's Ziarat Residency as the stamp impression. The reverse showed the Mazar-e-Quaid, Badshahi Mosque, Shah Faisal Mosque and the Northern Areas. It also gave the tourism department's website and the slogan 'Visit Pakistan.' ...|$|R
