50|$|The Job is {{an early}} work by American novelist Sinclair Lewis. It is {{considered}} an early declaration {{of the rights of}} working women. The focus is on the main character, Una Golden, and her desire to establish herself in a legitimate <b>occupation</b> while <b>balancing</b> the eventual need for marriage. The story takes place in the early 1900-1920s and takes Una from a small Pennsylvania town to New York. Forced to work due to family illness, Una shows a talent for the traditional male bastion of commercial real estate and, while valued by her company, she struggles to achieve the same status of her male coworkers.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether men’s and women’s noncognitive skills {{influence their}} occupational attainment and, if so, whether this {{contributes to the}} disparity in their relative wages. We find that noncognitive skills have a substantial effect on the probability of employment in many, though not all, occupations in ways that differ by gender. Consequently, {{men and women with}} similar noncognitive skills enter occupations at very different rates. Women, however, have lower wages on average not because they work in different occupations than men do, but rather because they earn less than their male colleagues employed in the same <b>occupation.</b> On <b>balance,</b> women’s noncognitive skills give them a slight wage advantage. Finally, we find that accounting for the endogeneity of occupational attainment more than halves the proportion of the overall gender wage gap that is unexplained. Keywords: JEL...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cognitive {{functioning}} {{may have}} implications for engagement in daily occupations among people with schizophrenia. Objectives: This cross-sectional study explores relationships between time use assessed occupational engagement and cognitive functioning among persons with schizophrenia. Methods: Thirty-nine participants from four mental health care services in Sweden participated. The Profile of Occupational Engagement among persons with Severe mental illness (POES) and a cognitive test battery was used. Results: Higher attention and psychomotor speed and higher scores in information processing speed, immediate and delayed verbal recall, and immediate and delayed visual recall were significantly correlated with higher scores in occupational engagement. Regression analyzes revealed that information processing speed and delayed visual recall best explained the variance in occupational engagement (R 2 = 0. 36). Conclusions: Cognitive functioning has implications for occupational engagement, and thus the ability to perform daily <b>occupations</b> in a <b>balanced</b> rhythm within various social and physical environments...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{cross-sectional}} {{study was to examine}} how subjective experiences of engagement in patterns of daily occupations (gainful employment, domestic work, enjoyable and recreational occupations) were associated with perceived health among women of working age. The sample (n= 488) was drawn from a longitudinal cohort study of women of working age in Gothenburg, Sweden. Participants were women 38 (n= 202) and 50 (n= 286) years of age. They completed a questionnaire including questions about occupational experiences in relation to their patterns of daily occupations, perceived health, and socioeconomic factors. The {{results of the present study}} showed that a combination of different experience dimensions of patterns of daily occupations was associated with perceived health among women of working age, even when adjusted for socioeconomic factors and age. The results provided occupational pattern-related health indicators, i. e. manageability, personally meaningful <b>occupations,</b> and occupational <b>balance.</b> To combine these health indicators can be a way for occupational therapists to enable women to develop strategies to promote health and to prevent stress and sick leave...|$|R
40|$|Chapecó {{is a city}} of Catarinense West {{which has}} {{considerable}} regional influence and whose urbanization process is associated to an intense agroindustrial activity, during the last decades. This article treats the increasing urbanization of Chapecó from 1950 to 2010 decades, highlighting, in cartograms, this expression along the years, focusing the, 3 urban and environmental impacts occurred, in special, about the occupation of river system basin of public supply and the conflict of the occurred use. The present study had as objective to comprehend this urban occupation process and, more specifically, as the aim to understand how it occurred, as also how to identify the main conflicts of soil use that occurred in it and its implications, as availing the influence that the occupation territorial plans had in this process, as well the historical, political and economical context. The work had as base an air photo analysis of the city in six different time cutting, they are: 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000, together the Municipal Prefecture of Chapecó/SC, file done the also, it was collect of referent data to the approval action of new allotments and analysis of director plans of the city.

40|$|Purpose. To {{describe}} activity level, operationalized as ADL {{capacity and}} performance of <b>occupations,</b> and occupational <b>balance,</b> operationalized as time use and satisfaction with occupations, in women with limited systemic sclerosis, and to investigate {{the relationship between these}} occupational factors and disease characteristics, demographic variables and well-being. Method. Forty-four women of working age and with long-standing limited systemic sclerosis were assessed regarding occupational factors, clinical variables, sociodemographic characteristics and well-being. Results. The women exhibited a generally high activity level and were satisfied with their daily occupations. More time spent working was related to spending less time on household chores, greater satisfaction with occupations in general and greater well-being. Symptoms such as breathlessness, fatigue and pain, influenced ADL capacity and satisfaction with occupations negatively. Conclusions. Work seems to be an important factor for satisfaction with occupations and well-being. This emphasizes the importance of investigating risk factors for work disability in people with systemic sclerosis, and of developing strategies for people with a work disability to enable them to maintain routines and a structured day. The findings also demonstrate the importance of reinforcing performance in satisfying occupations in order to maintain a feeling of well-being...|$|R
40|$|Aims The aims were to (i) {{investigate}} initial {{construct validity}} of a tool for assessment of time allocation in occupational balance, and (ii) describe perceived occupational balance and its relationship with socio-demographics, well-being, and personal recovery among people with mental illness. Methods Satisfaction with Daily <b>Occupations</b> and Occupational <b>Balance</b> (SDO-OB) was administered to 226 persons. SDO-OB reflects balance in five occupational domains: work, leisure, home chores, self-care, and overall occupational balance. Indicators for assessing construct validity were: satisfaction with everyday occupations, occupational value, symptom severity, and psychosocial functioning. For the second aim, the data collection included socio-demographics, life quality, self-esteem, self-mastery, and personal recovery. Results Occupational balance ratings indicated the participants were either under-occupied or in balance. Few were over-occupied. Feeling in balance was related to greater well-being and recovery compared with being under-occupied. Risk factors for under-occupation were younger age (in relation to work), and higher education (in relation to overall balance). Conclusions Associations with the indicators suggest initial construct validity. The SDO-OB is promising for assessment of occupational balance among people with mental illness. Being under-occupied was detrimental to well-being and recovery, and this indicates the importance of offering more occupational opportunities for people with mental illness...|$|R
40|$|Occupational balance {{has been}} an {{important}} concept within the discipline of occupational science. Historically {{it was one of the}} first formulated assumptions regarding occupation and health; for example, it was posited that participating in different types of occupation was essential to health. However assumptions are far from solid theoretical constructs that are confirmed in empirical studies. Questions on how balance is defined from an occupational perspective are likely to result in vague answers. However, the good news is that this is about to change. The past decade has offered a growing number of international empirical and theoretical studies that developed our knowledge of balance as a central concept in the discipline. In this seminar we will give a historical summary and examples from our own extensive research that reflect different but complementary emerging occupational perspectives on balance. Aspects of balance that will be covered in this international panel are: - Historical background, - Perceptions of occupational balance in different populations, - Experiences of balance in relationship to challenges and skills, - Occupational balance and health, - International perspectives on the concept of occupational balance, - A life balance model and measurement of balance, - A proposed definition of occupational balance developed from a concept analysis. The introducing presentations will illustrate the “state of the art” as a point of departure for discussion (30 minutes). The panel will then encourage a free dialogue in small groups (20 minutes) and summarised in a plenary session (10 minutes) on what it means to have an occupational perspective of balance and what aspects of balance occupational science might focus on and develop in the future. Implications for research will be emphasized. The panel session directly addresses the conference theme of globalization and partnerships by demonstrating meaningful, international connections toward advancing the theoretical construct of balance and empirical evidence for the relationship between occupational balance and health.

40|$|Elderly female {{caregivers}} shoulder {{responsibilities that}} {{put them at}} risk for developing physical, emotional, psychological, social, and financial difficulties. It is often assumed that the burdens associated with caregiving have a direct, negative impact on caregiver wellbeing. While previous studies have examined caregiver well-being {{in the context of}} caregiver burden, this study compared the relative well-being of elderly female caregivers with that of non-caregivers using life-style balance as a means of evaluation. Lifestyle balance was defined as a satisfying and health promoting pattern of regular <b>occupations.</b> Lifestyle <b>balance</b> was measured quantitatively in terms of relative satisfaction with occupations considered personally important to well-being. Thirty-seven volunteers, 15 caregivers and 22 non-caregivers, completed surveys that asked them to rate 31 different occupations on a scale of 1 - 5 in terms of the importance of that activity to their personal sense of well-being and also how satisfied they are with their participation in that occupation. For the purposes of this study, an occupation was considered important to well being if it received an importance rating of 4 or 5. While there was some overlap between caregivers and non-caregivers in terms of which occupations they rated important to wellbeing, caregivers, as a group, rated {{more than twice as many}} occupations important to wellbeing than did non-caregivers. Caregivers rated caregiving occupations important to wellbeing, while non-caregivers did not. Relative satisfaction with important occupations, and thus lifestyle balance, was found to be comparable between the two groups of participants. These findings underscore the importance of the personal meaning of an occupation as it relates to the impact of that occupation on an individual’s well-being. The findings also support the use of a strengths perspective when working with elderly female caregivers. These individuals frequently demonstrate competence and creativity in their efforts to cope with the demands of the caregiving role. This study also introduces the Occupational Balance: a Lifestyle Inventory, an instrument which is useful in assessing and modifying lifestyle balance in people of all ages and all walks of life...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between occupation and health is multi-faceted and complex. Developing {{new ways of}} assessing individuals’ experiences with daily life will help us {{learn more about the}} occupational nature of humans and the interrelationship with health. Not only is occupation a subjective experience, but how one <b>balances</b> <b>occupations</b> over time is also subjective, and cannot be defined by an outsider. The PPR Profile: Daily Experiences of Pleasure, Productivity and Restoration, currently being developed, provides individuals the opportunity to identify the blend of pleasure, productivity, and restoration that occurs in their daily occupations, thus beginning to uncover a more complex view of occupation. These three essential characteristics are considered to be innate biological needs that are met through engaging in daily life. Pre-testing of the PPR Profile not only began to validate the use of the three characteristics but assisted with clarifications of instructions and the rating scale. The purpose of this pilot study was to investigate some of the psychometric properties when administered to a normal adult population, and begin to examine the {{relationship between}} patterns of pleasure, productivity and restoration with one’s activities, health and well-being. Following approval from the institution’s human subject review committee, 40 - 50 adults, responsible for planning and orchestrating their own daily activities were recruited. Each completed a demographic survey with questions related to health, the Ryff’s Psychological Well-Being instrument and were given instructions for recording his/her daily activities and experiences for a 24 hour period of time using the PPR Profile. A semi-structured interview followed gathering feedback about the use and value of the PPR Profile. Preliminary data analyses are in process (using descriptive and correlational statistics). Anticipated results to be reported include measures of reliability and validity, along with quantitative (examining the relationship between patterns of pleasure, productivity and restoration and one’s activities, psychological well-being and health) and qualitative results (visual displays of patterns of pleasure, productivity and restoration). Future steps in the assessment development process will be identified, and implications for use in research and practice discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} presented in this dissertation is to explore individuals’ experiences regarding everyday occupations and adaptation to a changed life situation after disability. The aftermath of a severe illness or trauma changes human beings’ ability to keep up with their former capabilities and endurance. Physical capacity and occupational patterns are altered: self-care and moving around in-doors and around one’s neighbourhood often requires more time to perform, and new habits and roles are created during this period of adaptation. In caring for a family member, relatives take on tasks that are new to them, and they could suffer from symptoms of burnout. Adaptation to the activities of daily life could be a stressful period for the individual {{as well as for the}} relatives. Support from the family network and the work environment might be of assistance in the process of adapting to a current life situation. The question of how individuals as well as relatives change their habits and roles after disability, and how this influences their future occupational life, has not often been studied. This research gap, with the incentive to gain knowledge about individual experiences of returning to work with a disability pension or after having had a traumatic brain injury formed the topics for this dissertation. Qualitative methods were chosen for analysis with the intent of displaying the participants’ experiences from a number of perspectives. In gathering data for three separate studies, nine informal caregivers of family members with eating and swallowing difficulties, fourteen people with neuropsychological or musculoskeletal diseases having a disability pension and eight men recovering from a traumatic brain injury agreed to participate and were individually interviewed. The findings revealed implications for extended supportive interventions of counselling characteristics with the intention of enhancing the individuals’ ability to control their everyday <b>occupations</b> from a <b>balanced</b> point of view between what they have to do and what they want to do. Being the agents of their everyday domestic tasks as well as work routines could increase the individuals’ beliefs in their own skills. The conclusion drawn from the findings in this dissertation is that balancing activities after disability several of the participants chose to downsize at least one of the domains of home labour, leisure activities, or working hours in order to meet their capacity and endurance...|$|R
