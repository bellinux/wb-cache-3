A joint policy of inspection-based preventive maintenance (PM) and spare ordering considering two modes of spare ordering, namely, a regular order and an emergency order, is proposed for single-unit systems using a three-stage failure process. If {{the system is}} recognized {{to be in the}} minor defective stage, the <b>original</b> <b>inspection</b> interval is shortened and a regular order is placed. However, replacement is undertaken preventively or correctively if the severe defective stage is identified or a failure occurs. Depending on the system state and the state of the regular ordered spare when replacement is needed, all possible scenarios are considered to construct optimization model I. The decision variables are the optimal inspection interval and the times of shortening the <b>original</b> <b>inspection</b> interval. Additionally, model II on the basis of an assumption that the spare is always ordered at time 0 is also developed.

40|$|In older {{sections}} of industrial pipework {{there are often}} regions of general corrosion with a Gaussian thickness distribution. During guided wave inspection this corrosion causes {{an increase in the}} background noise and a significant attenuation of the inspection wave. These effects are investigated in this paper through finite element modelling of the interaction of torsional guided waves with rough surfaces in pipes. Pipes of different diameter and rough surface profile are modelled and it is found that the attenuation of waves is explained by significant mode conversion and scattering within the rough surface. This mode conversion is greatest when the non–axisymmetric modes to which energy is scattered are close to their cut-off frequency or when the ratio of surface correlation length to wavelength is around 0. 2 - 0. 25. Mode conversion increases with increasing surface roughness and is a strong function of frequency-diameter product, with larger pipes causing more mode conversion. When this mode conversion occurs the energy is lost mostly to those waves with a displacement profile closest to the <b>original</b> torsional <b>inspection</b> wave. Resulting attenuation of the inspection signal can be severe; for example a mean wall thickness loss of 28 % can cause 2. 7 dB/m attenuation in a pulse-echo configuration...|$|R

Do they have an active and functional role in memory retrieval or are they merely an epiphenomenon? In a recent study we reported that when eye movements were prohibited for participants who orally described pictures from memory, their recollections became altered and impaired (Johansson, Holsanova, Dewhurst, & Holmqvist, (in press). Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance). The current study was designed as a follow-up, aiming to uncover exactly how imposing different eye movements on participants affects memory retrieval processes. Eye movements were recorded from participants who recalled properties and spatial arrangements of sets of objects under four different manipulations: (1) free viewing on a blank screen; (2) gazing at a fixation cross; (3) looking at an area which was matched with the original locations of the objects to be recalled; (4) looking at an area which did not match the original locations of the objects to be recalled. By restricting eye movements in different ways during recall, we demonstrate the sensitivity of retrieval performance to specific eye movement manipulations. Results provide evidence that eye movements do have an active and supportive role when visuospatial information is recalled by highlighting the circumstances under which a visual memory is hampered. Additionally, findings suggest that the influence of "eye movements to nothing" is primarily related to the processing and retrieval of spatial information...|$|R

40|$|Software {{development}} is constrained by time, cost and quality requirements. Software defects {{are one of}} the most influential factors affecting the success of a software project. Software inspection has become an essential solution for managing software defects. A variety of software inspection techniques have been developed. Traditionally, software inspections are performed manually and require meeting-based activities. New inspection techniques have challenged the conventions by eliminating the defect collection meeting. The <b>original</b> asynchronous software <b>inspection</b> consists of private and public reviews, and it has been proven as effective as traditional ones. Different kinds of computer technologies are used to augment the software inspection process. This study empirically examined the effects of annotations of shared defect detection in asynchronous software inspection in which the private review is absent and all annotations are visible to members of the inspection team at all times. A Latin square experimental design was employed, and twenty-seven novices participated in the experiment as inspector subjects. The study results show that the defect discovery ratio is not affected by the number of annotations in the target materials under inspection. Thus, the study suggests that defect detection task and defect review task can be combined without loss. This basic finding of this research supports the proposition that more flexible focus of software inspection (i. e. asynchronous and shared annotation) may be adopted without negative impacts on defect detection. The analysis study also addresses additional issues related to software inspection, augmentation, cognition, and research design. i Acknowledgement...|$|R

The Bayesian Monitoring model, just as the inspection game, has different implications than enforcement models in the tradition of Becker (1968). Total deterrence of bad behavior is impossible, and the equilibrium probability of good behavior is independent of the suspect?s own payoff parameters. Hence, the maximum fine result does not apply.

Clear degradation signs were observed at temperatures 25 – 50 °C higher. Most of the fluids heated up to their thermalstability threshold exhibited an induction period of 5 – 50 h in which no decomposition was detectable but after which an observable degradation started. For a given fluid such period decreases at increasing temperatures. The use of fluids in a cyclic process in which the working medium permanence at the top temperature is very brief could take advantage of this behaviour with a reduction in degradation rates or with an increase in the limiting temperature. The influence of the decomposition products on the functionality of a thermodynamic power cycle was investigated by means of an appropriate computer code. The working fluid was assumed to be a binary mixture with 1 to 3 % concentration of a light decomposition product of the methane series. Chemical species such as CH 4 and CF 4 with a critical temperature much lower than that of the base fluid strongly affect the cycle configuration. On the contrary species with critical temperatures closer to that of the base fluid such as CH 3 F, CH 2 F 2 or CHF 3 influence only marginally the cycle performance.

Then Hebb's rule is found by requiring that changes of the synapses take place in an economical way, so that a minimal amount of energy is spent. The derivation of the Hebb rule as performed is `better' than any other derivation that can be encountered in the literature, where the Hebb rule is derived from a `cost function', since such a cost function is construed in such a way that it yields the `right', i. e., 'guessed to be right' Hebb rule one is after. It is comparable to the way the Einstein equations can be found from an action principle: the action then is chosen in such a way that the Einstein equations follow from it. Therefore, any derivation based on a cost function or an action is nothing more than postulating the final result in a disguised form. This is in contrast to our derivation of the Hebb rule, which starts from a biologically plausible assumption of economic use of the available biochemical energy in the physically ever changing system called brain. All Hebb rules ever derived in the literature from a cost function did not ever lead to the Hebb rule derived from the principle of minimal use of energy used in the present thesis. Apparently, the Hebb rule which the author of the thesis considers to be the actual rule, was considered to be inprobable by all his predecessors. The particular Hebb rule used in the thesis will be referred to as the `energy saving Hebb rule', in order to distinguish it from other rules found and used in the existing literature. In the technical terms of the subject, the energy saving Hebb rule can be stated to be a local, mixed Hebbian [...] Anti-Hebbian learning rule, which is asymmetric with respect to pre- and post-synaptic activity. The mathematically derived energy saving learning rule, as a surprise, encompasses precisely the two rules which one was left with after the careful but naive inspection mentioned above of the 81 a priori possible interpretations of Hebb's <b>original</b> postulate, an <b>inspection</b> that was based on biological plausibility only. The energy saving learning rule as found in the thesis still is a quantitative prescription, albeit that there remain two unknown parameters, not easily accessible within the chosen theoretical framework. These parameters are: an overall factor η (the so-called learning rate), and a constant κ (the so-called margin parameter). Setting apart these two fparameters, the energy saving learning rule can be characterized as quantitative, whereas Hebb's original learning rule certainly is qualitative only. In the third and last part of chapter 2 an analytical formula for the strengths w_ij of the synaptic connections is derived, supposing that the synaptic adaptation takes place according to the energy saving learning rule. The learning procedure used in this derivation is known to yield a result which happens to coincide with what essentially is the method that in the mathematical literature goes under the name of `pseudo-inverse solution'. However, for a biological neural net the original formulation of this well-known method of the pseudo-inverse could not be used directly. In the appendix of chapter 2 a modification of the method of the pseudo-inverse is be presented which overcomes all problems resulting from biologically induced particularities of the problem. In the following two chapters, chapters 3 and 4, the study of chapter 2 is deepened. Firstly, it is taken into account that not only ideal, unperturbed, patterns are learned by the neural net: realistic input data are noisy, i. e., the set of input patterns is enlarged. Secondly, one tries to get some grip and understanding of the margin parameter κ and the learning rate η occurring in the energy saving learning rule. In chapter 3, the following question is asked, and answered: what are the most suitable values to be assigned to the weights of a neural network. The result turns out to be a generalization of the expression for the weights after a learning process with the energy saving learning rule of chapter 2. This is unexpected, because it was found independently of any learning rule, but it certainly is an encouraging surprise. Apparently, the biological learning rule leads, after repeated application, to the result that one should find from a mathematical point of view. In chapter 4 learning in a neural network is considered again, just as in chapter 2, but now for noisy instead of fixed patterns. Via a Discrete Time Master Equation, the the process of adaptation of the synapses is described theoretically, using the energy saving learning rule. The final result is an expression for the weights w_ij, which, for unperturbed input, reduces to the expressions for w_ij found in chapter 2, as it should. For noisy input there is a slight difference with the mathematical result of chapter 2. This is due to the fact that, in an actual neural network, the synapses will always change a little bit, so that fixed patterns have a non-fixed representation in the mind. The mathematical approach of chapter 2 was not yet devised to take into account this subtle, time-dependent effect. The research of the chapters 2 - 4 of the thesis, which treat biological neural networks, can be summarized by stating that Hebb's postulate has been derived [...] -for the first time, and half a century after its formulation [...] - from a physical principle involving only economy of consumption of energy. The resulting Hebb rule, which was called 'energy saving rule' is much more precise, and almost quantitative, in contrast to its 1949 predecessor. In the final chapter 5 there is a switch from neural networks to related problems, namely the theory of spin-glasses. Both neural networks and spin-glasses possess a highly complex phase-space, which can be studied in many different ways. One of them is the so-called method of damage spreading, in which two identical systems with a different initial spin-configuration, are followed in time. It is shown that in a specific model, the spherical p-spin model, there exists a critical temperature which separates two different dynamical regimes. Moreover, a theoretical explanation is presented for the observed behavior of this spin-system. Although this chapter is less, or perhaps even totally non-biological, the concept of damage spreading is a useful tool to gain more insight in complex systems, among which biological neural networks...|$|R
