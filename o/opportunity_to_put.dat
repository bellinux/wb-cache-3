5|$|Larrea's {{business}} prospered, and in 1808 the Buenos Aires Cabildo {{appointed him}} to oversee a naval patrol to suppress shipments of contraband. This {{gave him an}} <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his nautical skills to use. He also participated in the secret meetings of patriots who promoted political change, and joined the 1809 Mutiny of Álzaga, which attempted to depose viceroy Liniers and replace him with a Junta. The mutiny failed, but the patriots continued to plot, and in 1810 the May Revolution succeeded in deposing the new viceroy. Larrea did not {{take part in the}} discussions at the open cabildo, but was appointed as member of the Primera Junta.|$|E
5|$|As her fame grew, Coffin {{gained the}} <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> her design {{principles}} into practice {{on a larger}} scale. Her practice had grown large {{enough for her to}} need an assistant by 1911, and by 1918 she had moved her office to larger premises at 830 Lexington Avenue. She also took on James Scheiner, an architect, as an associate. He became a key part of Coffin's practice, working on large-scale tasks such as overseeing work on the ground. This in turn opened up new opportunities for her to take on new, larger commissions. Coffin insisted on being paid the same fees as a male architect and to be treated equally in contracts; this was a novelty in itself, at a time when women were usually paid less than men. She also liked to employ women to work with her on commissions, giving them the chance to undertake apprenticeships that male prejudice had denied her when she had first started on her career.|$|E

To compensate for this, they force Mr. Burns to try being friendly and even smile. Mr. Burns makes a television commercial discussing Blinky with an actor portraying Charles Darwin, who claims Blinky is an evolutionary step and not a mutated fish. Combined with a promise to lower taxes and a smear campaign against Bailey, Mr. Burns ties {{with her in the}} polls. On the night before the election, Mr. Burns's advisers suggest that Mr. Burns have dinner at the home of a middle-class family as an <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> himself in the lead.

5|$|Stephen Decatur assumed {{command of}} President in December 1814, {{planning}} a cruise to the West Indies to prey on British shipping. In mid-January 1815, a snowy gale with strong winds forced the British blockading squadron away from New York Harbor, giving Decatur the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> to sea. On {{the evening of}} 14January, President headed out of the harbor but ran aground, the result of harbor pilots incorrectly marking a safe passage. Stranded on the sand bar, President lifted and dropped with the incoming tide. Within two hours her hull had been damaged, her timbers twisted, and masts sprung. Damage to her keel caused the ship to hog and sag. Decatur {{was finally able to}} float President off the bar and, assessing the damage, he decided to return to New York for repairs; however, the wind direction was not favorable and President was forced to head out to sea.|$|E
5|$|For Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro, the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> Eisenhower on a coin was the {{fulfillment}} of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro {{had been one of}} more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he stepped back from the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, Mamie Eisenhower, as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former First Lady was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971. Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the Washington quarter.|$|E

Late in October 1956, Israel, Britain, and France retaliated against Egypt after the latter country had seized the Suez Canal. In response to the crisis, Alameda County moved to Suda Bay, Crete, and had an emergency air base in operation by 22 November. From then until 4 December, she staged United Nations forces into the troubled area while evacuating Americans and other foreign nationals. Soon thereafter, she resumed normal operations out of Naples.|$|E

The 48th Division was attacked on 15 June 1918 by the Austrians at the Battle of the Piave River; {{in keeping with the}} plan, leading elements fell back and a counter-attack was organised, recapturing the lost ground and stalling the offensive entirely.|$|E

After Dallas made a field goal to take a 13-10 lead, Manning again led the Giants downfield.

Australia had the better of the short day's play, adding 50 runs without loss to pass the follow-on target, although Warne was lucky to survive on two occasions thanks to errors by Geraint Jones: when Warne had 55 he missed a relatively straightforward stumping opportunity, and on 68 he was dropped after edging a ball from Flintoff.

25|$|Shortly after, Fanti {{relocated}} to Switzerland where purely by chance he {{was presented with}} the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> into practice what he thought {{he should have done}} with the ill-fated diplomat. A German businessman wanted to start a psychotherapy treatment but he only had five weeks at his disposal. Fanti proposed him to maximize this short time available to them by doing sessions lasting a few hours on a daily basis. According to Fanti the difference was notable as themes and experiences that with 45 minutes sessions are held long before they appear tend to emerge sooner and in a much more spontaneous way. Fanti got convinced that daily long-lasting sessions empowered the work of association and liberated the psyche in a more physiological way from the natural resistances opposed to the psychoanalytical work as well as those specifically neurotic ones. The experience turned out to be so positive for Fanti that he decided to adopt the daily long-lasting sessions.|$|E
25|$|Soon thereafter, Gongshan Furao or Buniu, a {{retainer}} of the Ji family, revolted and {{took control of}} the forces at Bi. He immediately launched an attack and entered the capital Lu. Earlier, Gongshan had approached Confucius to join him, which Confucius considered. Even though he disapproved the use of a violent revolution, the Ji family dominated the Lu state force for generations and had exiled the previous duke. Although he wanted the <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> his principles into practice, Confucius gave up on this idea in the end. Creel (1949) states that, unlike the rebel Yang Hu before him, Gongshan may have sought to destroy the three hereditary families and restore the power of the duke. However, Dubs (1946) is of the view that Gongshan was encouraged by Viscount Ji Huan to invade the Lu capital in an attempt to avoid dismantling the Bi fortified walls. Whatever the situation may have been, Gongshan was considered an upright man who continued to defend the state of Lu, even after he was forced to flee.|$|E
