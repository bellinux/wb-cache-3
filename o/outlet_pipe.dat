25|$|In tanks using a flapper-flush valve, {{the outlet}} {{at the bottom}} of the tank is covered by a buoyant (plastic or rubber) cover, or flapper, which is held in place against a fitting (the flush valve seat) by water pressure. To flush the toilet, the user pushes a lever, which lifts the flush valve from the valve seat. The valve then floats clear of the seat, {{allowing}} the tank to empty quickly into the bowl. As the water level drops, the floating flush valve descends back to the bottom of the tank and covers the <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe</b> again. This system is common in homes in the US and in continental Europe. Recently this flush system has also become available in the UK due to a change in regulations.|$|E

Howell was the engineer for the new Council building to the design of Mr Smith; this could be George Smith who lived at Copthorne. The building was opened in 1868 and stood on the corner of Bank Buildings and Middle Street; now the corner of Middle Street and Station Road. , Queens Road, was begun in November 1869 and completed to the design of Matthew Edward Habershon; Howell's fee was £3,235.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} about {{investigating}} the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>pipes</b> {{effect on the}} compressors measured performance. From measurements made in a gas stand, a thermodynamic model is to be created and the compressor efficiency further investigated. The temperatures and pressures entering and leaving the compressor {{does not have to}} be the same as the temperatures measured in the gasstand, because of the thermodynamics of the pipes that connects the measurement equipment and the compressor. During a gasstand test the turbocharger is connected in a test bench, it is connected with pipes on both the compressor and turbine side, to simulate the hot exhaust gases from the car engine and the pressure increase over the compressor. The air entering and leaving the turbocharger through the different pipes is controlled and all the entering and leaving temperatures and pressures are measured. Gasstand data from different tests are available during the thesis, one specific turbocharger is used as references during the modeling. Models of the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>pipes</b> are created and connected to a compressor model. The model is controlled to give the same mass flow as the measured data, to ensure that the work cycle is followed. The effects of the non ideal inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>pipes</b> on measured compressor efficiency is studied with help of this model and the main impacts on the measured compressor efficiency are discovered. The result shows that the measured values used to calculate the compressor efficiency could change, depending on the measurement positions on the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>pipes.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Peatlands are {{important}} carbon stores {{and many have}} natural pipes (tunnels) that transport water and carbon. Pipes are often viewed as passive and slowly changing features of peatland landscapes, particularly for sites that are relatively undisturbed by land management. However, {{there is a lack}} of data on pipe morphology change over time. This paper presents the first survey of natural <b>pipe</b> <b>outlets</b> in a peatland in which morphological changes in <b>pipe</b> <b>outlets</b> through time were measured. Three surveys of natural <b>pipe</b> <b>outlets</b> between 2007 and 2010 were conducted in a 17. 4 ha, relatively undisturbed, blanket-peat-covered catchment in northern England. 27 of the 91 <b>pipe</b> <b>outlets</b> mapped in the first survey had perennial discharge and these outlets were significantly larger and shallower than those from ephemerally-flowing pipes. The cross-sectional area of 85 % of <b>pipe</b> <b>outlets</b> changed (increased or decreased) during the study, with 20 % of <b>pipe</b> <b>outlet</b> areas changing by more than 50 cm (equivalent to a median 207 % change in area for this upper fifth of pipes) up to a maximum of 312 cm for one <b>pipe</b> <b>outlet.</b> During the study, 18 <b>pipe</b> <b>outlets</b> completely infilled, while four new ones appeared. Mean <b>pipe</b> <b>outlet</b> area increased between August 2007 and July 2009 but decreased from July 2009 to April 2010. The largest changes in pipe morphology occurred between July 2009 and April 2010, which spanned the coldest winter for 31 years in the UK. During this period there was a significant increase in the proportion of vertically-elongated pipes and a decrease in the proportion of circular <b>pipes.</b> <b>Pipe</b> <b>outlet</b> morphology in blanket peat catchments is shown to be dynamic and may respond relatively quickly to changes in flow or extreme events, linked to short-term changes in weather and hence potentially to longer-term changes in climate or land management...|$|R

50|$|At its simplest, a {{balancing}} lake {{can be constructed}} by creating a dam across a drain or stream at a convenient valley, with a restricted diameter <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe</b> through the dam.

50|$|Inverted cone {{filtration}} (ICF) is {{a process}} used to remove particulate and dissolved contaminants from a designated fluid such as water. In a typical design, fluid enters the narrow top end of the filter falling onto a chamber where pressure head is built to force the fluid across woven filter media.

50|$|Petrol interceptors work on {{the premise}} that some {{hydrocarbons}} such as petroleum and diesel float on the top of water. The contaminated water enters the interceptor typically after flowing off roads or forecourts and entering a channel drain before being deposited into the first tank inside the interceptor. The first tank builds up a layer of the hydrocarbon as well as other scum. Typically petrol interceptors have 3 separate tanks each connected with a dip pipe, as more liquid enters the interceptor the water enters into the second tank leaving the majority of the hydrocarbon behind as it cannot enter the dip pipe, whose opening into the second tank is below the surface. However some of the contaminants may by chance enter the second tank. This second tank will not build up as much of the hydrocarbon on its surface. As before, the water is pushed into the third tank and more water enters the second. The third tank should be practically clear of any hydrocarbon floating on its surface. As a precaution, the <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe</b> is also a dip pipe. When the water leaves the third tank via the <b>outlet</b> <b>pipe</b> it should be contaminant free.|$|E

40|$|Expansion {{chambers}} with single-inlet and double-outlet {{are used}} in the exhaust system of internal combustion engines since they provide noise attenuation similar to simple chambers (single inlet/outlet), and reduce the flow noise and back pressure. This work presents a detailed analysis of the acoustic attenuation performance of elliptical expansion chambers with single-inlet and double-outlet. First, the finite element method (FEM) is considered in order to obtain a reference solution. Then, the mode-matching method (MMM) is applied at the area discontinuities of the muffler, considering a circular inlet pipe, a central elliptical chamber and two circular <b>outlet</b> <b>pipes.</b> This method reduces the computational requirements and enables to couple the acoustic fields within each region, described by means of Mathieu functions in the elliptical chamber and Bessel functions in the circular pipes. The solution given by this analytical approach is compared with finite element results and experimental measurements for a selected configuration, showing a good agreement. The acoustic behaviour is then analysed in detail {{as a function of the}} chamber length, the. eccentricity of the elliptical cross-section and the position of the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>pipes.</b> Some potential means to improve the acoustic performance are proposed...|$|R
