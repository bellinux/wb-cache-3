50|$|Public {{buildings}} such as hospitals frequently {{save energy}} by using motion detector switches, {{also known as}} <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors.</b> The <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> {{can also be used}} in residential applications such as in bathrooms, garages and hallways.|$|R
50|$|Smart {{lighting}} that utilizes <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> {{can work}} in unison with other lighting connected to the same network to adjust lighting per various conditions.

50|$|A vacancy sensor {{works like}} an <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor,</b> however, lights must be {{manually}} turned ON, but will automatically turn OFF when motion {{is no longer}} detected.|$|E
50|$|An <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> is {{a device}} that can tell if someone is in a room, and is often used in home {{automation}} and security systems. These are typically more advanced than motion sensors, which can only detect motion.|$|E
50|$|Some {{buildings}} rely on occupancy {{sensors to}} activate lighting or climate conditioning. Given {{the potential for}} long lead times before a space becomes sufficiently cool or warm, climate conditioning is not often initiated directly by an <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{an assessment}} project conducted to evaluate bi-level switching with <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> for lighting in individual offices. This emerging technology assessment {{study was designed}} to investigate the potential energy savings and economic performance of bi-level switching with <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> compared to the baseline single-level manual switching...|$|R

These <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> automatically turn off the lights after 30 minutes if there is no motion in a room. The project is estimated to cut energy consumption by 30 percent and save the university $100,000 annually.|$|R

50|$|A motion {{detector}} is {{a device that}} detects moving objects, particularly people. Such a device is often integrated {{as a component of}} a system that automatically performs a task or alerts a user of motion in an area. An <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> detects the presence of an entity within a certain space.|$|E
50|$|Lighting can {{be turned}} on, off, or dimmed with a {{building}} automation or lighting control system based on time of day, or on <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor,</b> photosensors and timers. One typical example is to turn the lights in a space on for a half-hour since the last motion was sensed. A photocell placed outside a building can sense darkness, {{and the time of}} day, and modulate lights in outer offices and the parking lot.|$|E

50|$|<b>Occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> is a {{descriptive}} term for various indoor motion detecting devices used {{to notice the}} presence of a person in a room or space, in order to automatically turn lights and/or temperature or ventilation systems on or off, using infrared, ultrasonic, microwave, or other technology. The term encompasses devices as different as PIR sensors, hotel room keycard locks and smart meters. Occupancy sensors are typically used to save energy, provide automatic control, and comply with building codes.|$|E
5000|$|Occupancy sensors for {{lighting}} control typically use infrared (IR), ultrasonic, tomographic motion detection, microwave sensors, or camera-based sensors (image processing). [...] The {{field of view}} of the sensor must be carefully selected/adjusted so that it responds only to motion in the space served by the controlled lighting. For example, an <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> controlling lights in an office should not detect motion in the corridor outside the office. Tomographic motion detection systems have the unique benefit of detecting motion through walls and obstructions, yet do not trigger as easily from motion {{on the outside of the}} detection area like traditional microwave sensors.|$|E
5000|$|Motion sensors {{are often}} used in indoor spaces to control {{electric}} lighting. If no motion is detected, {{it is assumed that}} the space is empty, and thus {{does not need to be}} lit. Turning off the lights in such circumstances can save substantial amounts of energy. In lighting practice occupancy sensors are sometime also called [...] "presence sensors" [...] or [...] "vacancy sensors". Some occupancy sensors (e.g. LSG's Pixelview, Philips Lumimotion, Ecoamicatechs Sirius etc.) also classify the number of occupants, their direction of motion, etc., through image processing. Pixelview is a camera-based <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor,</b> using a camera that is built into each light fixture.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the paper}} [...] "Energy savings due to <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> and {{personal}} controls: a pilot field study", Galasiu, A.D. and Newsham, G.R {{have confirmed that}} automatic lighting systems including <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> and individual (personal) controls are suitable for open-plan office environments and can save {{a significant amount of}} energy (about 32%) when compared to a conventional lighting system, even when the installed lighting power density of the automatic lighting system is ~50% higher than that of the conventional system.|$|R
5000|$|Force-sensing {{resistors}} {{are commonly}} used to create pressure-sensing [...] "buttons" [...] and have applications in many fields, including musical instruments, car <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors,</b> artificial limbs, Foot pronation systems and portable electronics.|$|R
50|$|<b>Occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> {{to allow}} {{operation}} for whenever someone {{is within the}} area being scanned can control lighting. When motion {{can no longer be}} detected, the lights shut off. Passive infrared sensors react to changes in heat, such as the pattern created by a moving person. The control must have an unobstructed view of the building area being scanned. Doors, partitions, stairways, etc. will block motion detection and reduce its effectiveness. The best applications for passive infrared <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> are open spaces with {{a clear view of the}} area being scanned. Ultrasonic sensors transmit sound above the range of human hearing and monitor the time it takes for the sound waves to return. A break in the pattern caused by any motion in the area triggers the control. Ultrasonic sensors can see around obstructions and are best for areas with cabinets and shelving, restrooms, and open areas requiring 360-degree coverage. Some <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> utilize both passive infrared and ultrasonic technology, but are usually more expensive. They can be used to control one lamp, one fixture or many fixtures.|$|R
50|$|Motion {{detectors}} {{have found}} wide use in domestic and commercial applications. One common application is activating automatic door openers in businesses and public buildings. Motion sensors are also {{widely used in}} lieu of a true <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> in activating street lights or indoor lights in walkways, such as lobbies and staircases. In such smart lighting systems, energy is conserved by only powering the lights for the duration of a timer, after which the person has presumably left the area. A motion detector may be among the sensors of a burglar alarm that is used to alert the home owner or security service when it detects the motion of a possible intruder. Such a detector may also trigger a security camera to record the possible intrusion.|$|E
40|$|Occupancy sensors are {{lighting}} control devices that automatically turn lights {{on when they}} detect motion, and off when motion is not detected for an allotted time period. These sensors can be applied virtually anywhere, indoor or outdoor, and can provide substantial energy savings. One application that does not utilize occupancy sensors often enough is classrooms. Cal Poly currently utilizes an outdated toggle switch system that students do not maintain properly, wasting a large quantity of energy. This paper will examine the maintaining of the current {{lighting control}} system in Cal Poly’s Construction Innovation Center (CIC) lab classrooms; the operating cost of the current lighting system, the specifics of a proposed <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> system, the payback period of the <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> system, new industry knowledge, conclusions of the study, lessons learned, and recommendations for implementing occupancy sensors. The project determined an excellent <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> system to install in the CIC; however, the precise consumption of the current lighting system was not determined due to unavailable data. Educated assumptions based on personal experiences and observations were factored into calculations. As a result, the project encourages the implementation of an <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> system, specifically the wireless Lutron Energi TriPak. Altogether, this experience offered valuable lessons, which included methods to overcome obstacles, {{as well as the}} importance of valid communication, detailed planning, and punctuality...|$|E
40|$|To develop {{energy-saving}} environment control systems, {{we propose}} autonomic wireless sensor/actuator networks that classify a user’s behaviors {{in relation to}} environment control such as lighting, and that configure themselves depending on sensor node selection. In our system, a wireless remote control node monitors a user’s actions with respect to environment control, and <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> networks simultaneously detect the user’s movement. The system learns {{the relationship between the}} responses of the remote control node and the <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> networks to classify the user’s behaviors with only the <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> networks. The system chooses informative sensor nodes for this behavior classification based on an information gain criterion. These chosen nodes have a high sensing cost. Sensor network routing is controlled based on the sensing cost and communication cost metric. In the resultant sensor networks, the sensing performance is the same as that in the original network, but the resources are successfully allocated to the nodes. In addition, less informative and redundant nodes are identified. We demonstrate tracking environment control behaviors and sensor node selection using the sensor/actuator networks testbed...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{lighting}} {{controls are}} used to reduce lighting energy consumption. One such control {{is the use of}} <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors.</b> Energy savings achievable by <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> depend on the occupancy pattern, which is related to building and occupant characteristics. The occupancy pattern has some degree of randomness for many building types. This article describes a method for the prediction of occupancy and lighting energy consumption based on user defined probabilities. Real lighting energy consumption from a recent retrofit program was used to demonstrate the model calculation. Comparison of the energy saving potential from different delay time settings was also made. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
30|$|Switching off {{lights in}} {{uninhabited}} {{parts of the}} house, and in spaces where natural light can adequately provide the required illumination is a prospect for energy cut. This can be done either automatically or manually by switch. Provision of lighting switches at strategic points can aid manual switching. By utilizing diverse method of automatic controls such as motion detectors, <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> etc., lighting fittings can either be switched on or off automatically. Energy savings using such devices will prove significant. Programmable timers have the capability of saving up to about 10 – 30  % of lighting energy while <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> and photo sensors are capable of reducing energy consumption by 30 – 60 and 10 – 35  %, respectively [19].|$|R
40|$|<b>Occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> {{are used}} in care {{applications}} to measure the presence of patients on beds or chairs. Sometimes {{it is necessary to}} swiftly alert help when patients try to get up, in order to prevent falls. Most systems on the market are based on pressure-mats that register changes in compression. This restricts their use to applications below soft materials. In this work we want to investigate two categories of <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> with the requirements of supporting wireless communication and a focus on low-cost of the systems. We chose capacitive proximity sensors and accelerometers that are placed below the furniture. We outline two prototype systems and methods {{that can be used to}} detect <b>occupancy</b> from the <b>sensor</b> data. Using object detection and activity recognition algorithms, we are able to distinguish the required states and communicate them to a remote system. The systems were evaluated in a study and reached a classification accuracy between 79 % and 96 % with ten users and two different beds...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} of the actual {{lighting}} savings achievable from <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> use was performed by Pacific Northwest Laboratory (PNL) for the US Department of Energy (DOE) on the Hanford Site near Richland, Washington. The study involved two seperate field assessments. The objective of the first test was to assess and effectively quantify the potential ``wasted-light`` hours associated with different occupant and space types associated with <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> control installations. These quantities are the primary factor in determining actual lighting energy savings associated with occupancy lighting control. The second test was conducted to explore the potential additional savings from more sensitive sensor equipment or better equipment adjustment that might {{reduce the need for}} delay timers. This information provides quantitative insight into the energy savings lost because of the limitations of current sensing equipment...|$|E
40|$|<b>Occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> {{systems are}} gaining {{traction}} {{as an effective}} technological approach to reducing energy use in exterior commercial lighting applications. Done correctly, occupancy sensors can substantially enhance the savings from an already efficient lighting system. However, this technology is confronted by several potential challenges and pitfalls that can leave {{a significant amount of}} the prospective savings on the table. This report describes anecdotal experiences from field installations of <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensor</b> controlled light-emitting diode (LED) lighting at two parking structures and two parking lots. The relative levels of success at these installations reflect a marked range of potential outcomes: from an additional 76 % in energy savings to virtually no additional savings. Several issues that influenced savings were encountered in these early stage installations and are detailed in the report. Ultimately, care must be taken in the design, selection, and commissioning of a sensor-controlled lighting installation, else the only guaranteed result may be its cost...|$|E

40|$|Energy {{consumption}} in residential buildings consumes 22 % {{of the total}} US energy each year and is highly impacted by the occupant behavior. In order to model domestic demand profiles more accurately, {{it is important to}} understand occupancy behavior profile. Four low income houses in Texas are used as the test beds. The <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> are installed in every room. The real-life occupancy data from the <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors</b> were compared with the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data. The study period is from July 1 to August 31. The preliminary result shows that there is a similarity between ATUS data and actual occupancy profile. In addition, simulations in EnergyPlus were conducted to test how much energy consumption can be saved based on the thermostat control of real-life occupancy behavior patterns. The results show that such control can save cooling energy by 7 %...|$|R
50|$|Over-illumination can {{be reduced}} by {{installing}} <b>occupancy</b> <b>sensors,</b> using natural sunlight whenever possible, turning off lights when leaving a room, or changing the type of lightbulb. Over-illumination does not refer to snowblindness, where high exposure to ultraviolet light causes physical damage to the eye. Too little light, the opposite of over-illumination, is associated with seasonal affective disorder.|$|R
