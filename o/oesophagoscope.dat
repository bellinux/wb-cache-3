40|$|Patients with {{haemorrhage}} from oesophageal varices {{associated with}} portal hypertension are poor risks for anaesthesia and surgery. One method of controlling such haemorrhage is injection of the oesophageal varices (sclero-therapy) via an <b>oesophagoscope.</b> Careful preoperative preparation {{and use of}} the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube in combination with the anaesthetic technique of intermittent Althesin and suxamethonium with artificial ventilation with nitrous oxide and oxygen enables sclerotherapy to be carried out successfully...|$|E
40|$|Four {{patients}} with a stricture of the cervical oesophagus are described. The stricture was hard and fibrotic and usually involved at least 2 cm of the oesophagus; there was no obvious cause of these strictures. Its management is described, using a local skin flap to replace the stenosed segment. This condition {{does not appear to}} have been described before. Unlike the thoracic oesophagus below it and the pharynx above it, the cervical oesophagus has excited little interest in the surgical literature. Indeed during the last 15 years, there have been few reports in the English literature on benign diseases of this part of the oesophagus. THE PATIENTS Four patients and the relevant findings are inclu-ded in the Table. There was no history of an impacted foreign body in any patient. The stricture in the three women (Table) was severe and extensive; its upper end was at or just below the cricopharyngeus, so that the stenoses did not affect the post-cricoid space. When examined with the <b>oesophagoscope,</b> the stricture was very tight and could only be dilated with difficulty, if at all; because of the hardness of the stricture, all three were suspected of having carcinoma, until proved otherwise by repeated biopsy. A biopsy was difficult to obtain in all of them because the stricture could not be dilated sufficiently to allow an <b>oesophagoscope</b> to be passed through. In the male patient, the stricture was soft and annular, and situated in the middle of the cervical oesophagus. It could be dilated easily by the <b>oesophagoscope.</b> Radiography demonstrated the strictures in the first three patients to be 'string-like ' and at least 2 cm long. The barium swallow of patient M. C. is shown (Fig. 1), from which it can be seen that the stric-FIG. 1. Barium swallow ofpatient M. C.

5|$|In the 1920s, Negus {{worked on}} aspects of both throat surgery and {{the anatomy of}} the larynx, the latter work {{contributing}} to his degree of Master of Surgery (1924). His surgical innovations included designs for laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes, <b>oesophagoscopes,</b> an operating table, and tracheotomy equipment. His major publications were The Mechanism of the Larynx (1929) and {{his work on the}} clinical text Diseases of the Nose and Throat, starting with the fourth edition of 1937. Negus was also awarded several lectureships and published many medical papers and other works on comparative anatomy and laryngology. He became a senior surgeon at King's College Hospital in 1940 and a consulting surgeon in 1946.|$|R
5|$|At this point, {{still early}} in his {{surgical}} career, Negus took {{a different approach to}} that which was common at the time. Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook basic research on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years. While engaged in this research, Negus continued his work at King's College Hospital, being appointed junior surgeon in 1924. It was during this period, following his return from the USA, that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson, and worked to improve the designs of the endoscopes and other equipment used in ENT surgery. These instruments, developed in collaboration with the Genito-Urinary Company of London, included laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes (such as the Negus bronchoscope) and <b>oesophagoscopes.</b> Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an operating table (known as the King's College table), and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes. He also helped develop strategies for treatments of throat cancer to aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy.|$|R
40|$|Fifty-six {{patients}} with recent variceal haemorrhage were studied {{in a trial}} of repeated injection sclerotherapy through the flexible <b>oesophagoscope,</b> with a mean follow-up of 15. 2 months (1 - 39). Twenty-five patients (45 %) did not suffer further bleedings. The risk of bleeding per patient-month of follow-up decreased significantly (p less than 0. 05) after starting therapy, in all groups of cirrhosis, classified according to Child's criteria. Mortality {{during the study period}} was 39 % (19. 6 % due to recurrence of variceal bleeding). The main complications of the procedure were the development of oesophageal wall ulcerations and oesophageal stricture. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} {{lithium battery}} cell was impacted in the cricopharynx of a 1 year and 9 month-old child. The battery cell was safely removed with the pediatric flexible <b>oesophagoscope</b> under anesthesia without {{trauma to the}} surrounding structures. The lithium battery cell is potentially dangerous due to its ability to cause chemical damage to the mucosa and cause early inflammation and edema leading to dysphagia and respiratory obstruction. Hence, it should be promptly extracted without delay to prevent catastrophe. The toddler recovered uneventfully in the immediate post-operative period and was followed-up for the last 1 year without any complication. To the horizon of our knowledge, no previous case was reported with computer battery cell in the cricopharynx of a toddler in Eastern India. In conclusion, parent education {{is important in the}} early detection of foreign bodies and their interventions...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} rare {{case of an}} unusually long foreign body (Da-tun) {{impacted}} in the esophagus of a 56 year-old gentleman. He was literate, without any psychiatric illness and had been using “Neem ” (Azadirachta indica) stick for cleaning his teeth for the past twenty years. Neem sticks are used for brushing teeth, {{perhaps one of the}} earliest and very effective dental care. On closer questioning he revealed his habit of passing the Neem stick into his throat with the aim of clean-ing it too while cleaning his teeth. He presented to our emer-gency early in the morning with this strange long foreign body impacted in his esophagus which was removed success-fully using a Jackson’s adult rigid <b>oesophagoscope.</b> We be-lieve this to be the first case of such an unusually long for-eign body to be reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Endoscopic {{injection}} sclerotherapy of oesophageal varices {{was performed}} in 71 patients: 50 with intrahepatic and 21 with extrahepatic block. In summary 330 procedures were done: 220 under general anaesthesia using the Negus rigid <b>oesophagoscope</b> and 110 with diazepam as premedication using a flexible, fibreoptic endoscope. Definitive control of variceal haemorrhage was achieved in 30 of 34 emergency admissions (88 %). The hospital mortality in acute variceal bleeding was 26. 5 %. Elective, repeated sclerotherapy {{was performed in}} 60 patients. In 43 patients complete obliteration of varices or their marked reduction were observed. Rebleeding occurred in 23 % and major complications in 17 % of patients. The overall one year survival rate was 82 %. We consider sclerotherapy {{as a method of}} choice in bleeding oesophageal varices uncontrollable by vasopressin and balloon tamponade. It also represents a valuable method of preventing rebleeding particularly in patients with a high operative risk...|$|E
40|$|During a 10 year {{study period}} 234 {{patients}} were admitted on 371 occasions {{with a total}} of 566 acute variceal bleeding episodes. Of these, 173 patients had 343 variceal bleeds which required balloon tamponade to achieve initial control of bleeding during 229 admissions and were then referred for emergency injection sclerotherapy. Sixty-eight percent of these patients had alcoholic cirrhosis and 42 % were poor risk Grade C patients. Injection sclerotherapy was performed initially using the rigid Negus <b>oesophagoscope</b> under general anaesthesia and later using the fibreoptic endoscope under light sedation. Definitive control of variceal bleeding was achieved with sclerotherapy during 197 hospital admissions (92 %). Of the 17 failures of emergency sclerotherapy, 4 patients died from uncontrolled bleeding and 13 patients underwent major surgical intervention. Definitive control of variceal bleeding was achieved with a single injection treatment in 138 hospital admissions (70 %). Complications were mostly of a minor nature and occurred at a rate of 6 % per injection treatment. The overall hospital admission mortality was 36 %. The majority of patients died due to liver failure. The mortality in patients who required 4 injection treatments to control variceal bleeding was 71 %. Injection sclerotherapy is proposed as the emergency treatment of choice for patients whose variceal bleeding continues or recurs after initial conservative management. Patients whose variceal bleeding is not controlled by 2 injection treatments require more major emergency surgery...|$|E
40|$|Moreover, {{these results}} are not {{reserved}} for expert centres alone. After 24 months of training, the diagnostic sensitivity of pulmonologists without experience in TBNA rose from 24 to 78 % [5]. TBNA has some important advantages. 1) It can be performed during the bronchoscopic procedure that is already necessary in the work-up of patients suspected for lung cancer. The extra time {{is limited to a}} few minutes and the additional costs of a TBNA needle are, 90 J. 2) The use of ultrasound is a necessity in the <b>oesophagoscope</b> as there are no anatomical landmarks in the oesophagus. During bronchoscopy, one can rely on several endobronchial landmarks to localise lymph nodes. In the only randomised trial in the literature concerning the use of ultrasound-guided versus ‘‘blind’ ’ TBNA, {{there was no significant difference}} in the diagnostic yield of subcarinal lymph nodes [8]. 3) It is a cost-effective procedure which may diagnose N 3 disease in an important number of cases, and consequently avoid mediastinoscopy (1, 550 J in our hospital) [6]. 4) From the patient’s point of view, if TBNA performed during the necessary bronchoscopy is diagnostic, no additional endoscopic procedures are needed. After all, who would volunteer for oesophagoscopy? In an editorial comment on the endoscopic approach of mediastinal lymph nodes, the vast literature on the excellent results of TBNA should not be neglected. Before endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration is proclaimed as the new gold standard, and pulmonologists are advised to learn oesophagoscopy, we should first learn to perform a routine transbronchial needle aspiration during the bronchoscopy. This approach is cost-effective and limits the number of endoscopic procedures, which may even be unnecessary. Your patient will be grateful to you...|$|E
