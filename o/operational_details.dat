Shortly after noon on 3 September, U-66 reported a position in the North Sea that placed her beyond known British minefields, in what was her last known contact. A postwar German study offered no explanation for U-66s loss. British records suggest that U-66 may have either struck a mine in an older minefield in the Dogger Bank area, or that a combination of destroyers, submarines, and anti-submarine net tenders sank U-66 sometime between 1 and 11 October.

40|$|The {{realized}} {{and expected}} growth of {{variable renewable energy}} sources challenges both power system operation and power system planning. A decreasing share of dispatchable generation technologies in electricity generation and an increasing need for short-term flexibility means that the added value of alternative short-term flexibility providers, such as electricity storage, becomes important. This paper studies {{the way in which}} alternative flexible resources, here storage technologies, generate added value by running various set-ups of a power system planning model with different levels of <b>operational</b> <b>detail.</b> Firstly, this allows to identify the different roles flexible technologies play in power system operation, and the subsequent impact on power system planning. Secondly, this allows to determine the importance of <b>operational</b> <b>detail</b> in power system planning models to accurately assess the value of flexibility. Results show that storage technologies have the technical ability to provide firm capacity, smoothen the residual load curve, manage the impact of hourly dispatch constraints and provide reserve capacity. Nevertheless, the extent to which this is translated into investment depends on how cost-effectively a technology can offer these services. Results further show that to fully capture the added value of flexibility providers high <b>operational</b> <b>detail</b> is needed in planning models. status: submitte...|$|R
40|$|Long-term (LT) {{energy system}} {{planning}} models are frequently used in studies analyzing the transition towards a sustainable energy system. To limit the computational cost, these LT models typically {{have a low}} temporal resolution. In addition, these models typically operate at a technology level, rather then considering individual power plants. Therefore, operational constraints and cycling costs of power plants cannot be represented, i. e. the <b>operational</b> <b>detail</b> is low. For energy systems with a high penetration of intermittent renewables (VRES), these simplifications could have a substantial impact on the model outcome. This work analyzes and quantifies the impact of both the low temporal resolution and the limited <b>operational</b> <b>detail</b> for an increasing share of intermittent renewables in the generation mix. To this end, {{the results of a}} LT planning model using a low temporal resolution are compared to a LT model using hour-by-hour data. Furthermore, {{to assess the impact of}} the limited <b>operational</b> <b>detail,</b> the dispatch of the LT models is re-evaluated using a mixed integer linear unit commitment (UC) model. Using a low temporal resolution is shown to lead to an inaccurate representation of the residual load duration curve (RLDC), in turn leading to sub-optimal investments, an over-estimation of the potential uptake of VRES and an underestimation of operational costs. Neglecting <b>operational</b> <b>detail</b> of power plants leads to similar results, though to a lesser degree. These effects are quantified for a case study based on the Belgian power system. In this study, operational costs in the LT model with at a low temporal resolution are shown to be 3 - 58 % lower than in the corresponding UC model, whereas for the model with a high temporal resolution the underestimation of operational costs is only 3 - 23 %. Highest deviations are observed for the largest shares of VRES. status: publishe...|$|R

The British security services decided that the best response was to publish the story of Mincemeat. Over the course of a weekend Montagu wrote The Man Who Never Was (1953), which sold two million copies and formed the basis for a 1956 film. The security services did not give Montagu complete freedom to reveal <b>operational</b> <b>details,</b> and he was careful not to mention the role played by signals intelligence to confirm that the operation had been successful.

40|$|To {{limit the}} {{computational}} cost, bottom-up long-term (LT) energy-system planning models typically have a stylized temporal representation {{and do not}} consider techno-economic operational constraints of power plants. Both these simplifications {{have been shown to}} {{have a significant impact on}} the results. However, increasing the level of temporal and techno-economic <b>operational</b> <b>detail</b> will result in an increased computational cost. In this regard, the first goal of this work is to quantify which of these simplifications has the highest impact on the results, and should therefore be prioritized for improving. To do so, the impact of both the low level of temporal and techno-economic <b>operational</b> <b>detail</b> are quantified for a varying penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES). For a high penetration of IRES, the gains obtained by improving the temporal representation are shown to outweigh the gains obtained by incorporating <b>detailed</b> techno-economic <b>operational</b> constraints. Therefore, improving the temporal representation is suggested to be prioritized. The second goal of this paper is to identify opportunities for model improvements. Different approaches to improve the temporal dimension are proposed. While the focus in the literature lies primarily on the impact of the temporal resolution, this work more fundamentally considers and assesses different approaches of dealing with the temporal dimension. Using a different approach of defining the time segments to explicitly account for IRES variability is found to lead to a higher accuracy than can be obtained by simply increasing the temporal resolution, while requiring a lower number of time segments. Moreover, a temporal representation based on selecting a set of representative days can achieve an even higher accuracy, albeit requiring a higher number of time slices. An additional advantage of using representative days is that chronology is retained such that the impact of short-term dynamic fluctuations of IRES can be accounted for. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{semantics}} {{serves as}} an interface between a language and the user: the interface serving to hide a significant degree of <b>operational</b> <b>detail</b> and present a simpler view of program execution to the user. What are the properties that an abstract semantics should satisfy? It was an insight of Strachey [4 l] that the abstract semantics must be compositional; thus, one {{must be able to}} "build up" the abstract meaning of a program from the abstract meanings of its components. Note that it is not immediately obvious how one thinks of recursive programs in this manner. This is the role of fixpoint theory developed by Scott [62]. Informally, fixpoint theory formalisms the intuitive inductive arguments that one uses in reasoning about recursive programs. The theory developed by Scott works for determinate programs: programs that yield one output for every input. Thus, the theory is inadequate to handle indeterminate programs: programs that can yield more than one output for a given input. Powerdomains, that can be viewed as the computable analogue of the powerset, were developed to enlarge the scope of the theory of Scott to handle indeterminate computations [52, 64]. Domain theory, enriched with powerdomain constructions to handle indeterminacy has been successful in serving as a mathematical formalism powerful enough to specify abstract semantics for tranformational programs: programs that take a input, compute in isolation and return an output. Thus, programs are usually denoted by functions in the determinate case and as Input-Output relations in the indeterminate case. The semantics is termed abstract because it hides significant degree of internal <b>operational</b> <b>detail</b> and presents an extensional view of programs. The situation is not as clear for interactive programming systems: systems built out of processes which engage in communication with the environment and/or other processes while computing. The key difference from transformational systems is that the output produced by a process can influence its input. Static, determinate dataflow [32] is the prime example of the few models interactive systems that are amenable to extensional treatment...|$|R
