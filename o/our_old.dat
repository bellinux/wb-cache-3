25|$|In Spring 1916 the {{division}} {{was moved to}} the Vimy Ridge sector near Arras. This was quiet to begin with, but in April intensive mining operations were begun by both sides, and on 20 May the Germans attacked and took some ground from {{the division}}. The 1/21st and 1/24th Bns counter-attacked on the evening of 23 May. The 1/24th was held up, but A Company of the First Surreys went ahead and recaptured the old line, holding it for about an hour and causing heavy casualties to the enemy. However, they were unsupported by flanking forces and were compelled to return: 'Nothing was left to show for this gallant and costly action beyond a few yards of <b>our</b> <b>old</b> front line'. To hold its position against German counter-attack {{at the end of the}} action, the battalion had to be reinforced by a company of the 1/22nd Londons, by the divisional engineers and pioneers and by the tunnelling companies. The First Surreys suffered 187 casualties of all ranks in this action.|$|E

He said that he wanted [...] "either <b>our</b> <b>old</b> master, or no master at all". To avoid being forced to pledge allegiance, he escaped from Buenos Aires and sought asylum at the chapel of Mercedes, in the Banda Oriental.|$|E
500|$|The {{story of}} Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle was {{inspired}} by Kitty MacDonald, a Scottish washerwoman the Potters employed {{over the course of}} eleven summers at Dalguise House on the River Tay in Perthshire, writes Leslie Linder. Potter was 26 when, in 1892, she visited MacDonald while staying at Heath Park, Birnam. She wrote in her journal: [...] "Went out with the pony... to see Kitty MacDonald, <b>our</b> <b>old</b> washerwoman... Kitty is eighty-three but waken, and delightfully merry... She is a comical, round little woman, as brown as a berry and wears a multitude of petticoats and a white mutch. Her memory goes back for seventy years, and I really believe she is prepared to enumerate the articles of her first wash in the year '71".|$|E

500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Vicksburg, Ewing's command wrecked Confederate President Jefferson Davis's Fleetwood Plantation, and Ewing turned over Davis' personal correspondence to his brother-in-law, Sherman. However, Ewing also sent copies of the letters to a few people he had known in Ohio, which, after the documents were published, permanently sullied the reputation of former President Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire. Their release coincided with that of Pierce's book, <b>Our</b> <b>Old</b> Home. As early as 1860, Pierce had written to Davis about [...] "the madness of northern abolitionism", and other letters uncovered stated that he would [...] "never justify, sustain, or in any way or to any extent uphold this cruel, heartless, aimless unnecessary war", and that [...] "the true purpose {{of the war was}} to wipe out the states and destroy property." ...|$|E

[...] He returned to his favourite pastimes, breeding sporting dogs and fighting cocks. A terrier bitch, {{for which he was}} offered 100guineas (about Â£ as of [...] ), was said to be the finest in England. He refused to sell the dog, which became his lifetime companion. He began again to attend sporting events, as a report on the Leicester Races of September 1806 noted that [...] "Among the distinguished characters upon the turf we were glad to see <b>our</b> <b>old</b> friend, Mr.Daniel Lambert, in apparent high health and spirits". Although too heavy to follow hunts on horseback, he used a portion of the money earned in London to build up a pack of greyhounds, watching from his carriage as they coursed hares in the Leicestershire countryside.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the cause}} of women's {{suffrage}} remained her principal concern, {{at least until the}} First World War, Cobden was active in other campaigns. In 1903 she defended the principles of free trade, as expressed by her father, against Joseph Chamberlain's tariff reform crusade. [...] Chamberlain had called for a policy of Imperial Preference, and the imposition of tariffs against countries opposed to Britain's imperial interests. To a meeting in Manchester, Cobden expressed confidence that [...] "Manchester... will tell Mr Chamberlain that it is still loyal to <b>our</b> <b>old</b> flag: free trade, peace and goodwill among nations". [...] In 1904, Richard Cobden's centenary year, she published The Hungry Forties, described by Anthony Howe in a biographical article as [...] "an evocative and brilliantly successful tract". [...] It was one of several free trade books and pamphlets issued by the Fisher Unwin press which, together with celebratory centenary events, helped to define free trade as a major progressive cause of the Edwardian era.|$|E

Thirty Seconds to Mars {{had attempted to}} sign with a new label after the A Beautiful Lie tour, prompting EMI (the parent label of Virgin) to file a lawsuit for $30 million. EMI claimed that the band had failed to produce {{three of the five}} records they were obligated to deliver under their 1999 contract, which Virgin entered into with the now-defunct Immortal Records. Jared Leto responded to some of the claims in the suit stating [...] "under California law, where we live and signed our deal, one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years."

500|$|In July 1917, a KRRC Rhodesian platoon {{received}} lofty {{praise from}} a senior British officer, who described the colonials as [...] "absolutely first-class soldiers and great gentlemen, {{every bit as}} good as soldiers... as <b>our</b> <b>old</b> Expeditionary Force". Around the same time, a platoon of Southern Rhodesians in the KRRC took part in an engagement near Nieuwpoort in Flanders, where it and the Northamptonshire Regiment manned positions on the eastern banks of the river Yser. After a heavy artillery bombardment, German infantry and marines charged the British positions and surrounded the Rhodesian platoon. Brutal hand-to-hand fighting ensued in {{which most of the}} Southern Rhodesians were killed and some were taken prisoner. The Bulawayo Chronicle ran a eulogy for them soon after, comparing their last stand to that of Allan Wilson's Shangani Patrol in 1893. Later in 1917, a Rhodesian platoon in the KRRC fought in the Battle of Passchendaele, near Ypres in western Flanders.|$|E
500|$|The {{civil disobedience}} in 1930 {{marked the first}} time women became mass {{participants}} in the struggle for freedom. Thousands of women, from large cities to small villages, became active participants in satyagraha. Gandhi had asked that only men take part in the salt march, but eventually women began manufacturing and selling salt throughout India. Usha Mehta, an early Gandhian activist, remarked that [...] "Even <b>our</b> <b>old</b> aunts and great-aunts and grandmothers used to bring pitchers of salt water to their houses and manufacture illegal salt. And then they would shout {{at the top of their}} voices: 'We have broken the salt law!'" [...] The growing number of women in the fight for sovereignty and self-rule was a [...] "new and serious feature" [...] according to Lord Irwin. A government report on the involvement of women stated [...] "thousands of them emerged....from the seclusion of their homes...in order to join Congress demonstrations and assist in picketing: and their presence on these occasions made the work the police was required to perform particularly unpleasant." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{eventually}} supplant Christianity with a religion more amenable to National Socialist ideology, Himmler, together with Alfred Rosenberg, sought {{to replace it with}} Germanic paganism (the indigenous traditional religion or Volksreligion of the Germanic peoples), of which the Japanese Shinto was seen as an almost perfect East Asian counterpart. For this purpose they had ordered the construction of sites for the worship of Germanic cults in order to exchange Christian rituals for Germanic consecration ceremonies, which included different marriage and burial rites. In Heinrich Heims' Adolf Hitler, Monologe im FHQ 1941-1944 (several editions, here Orbis Verlag, 2000), Hitler is quoted as having said on 14 October 1941: [...] "It seems to be inexpressibly stupid to allow a revival of the cult of Odin/Wotan. <b>Our</b> <b>old</b> mythology of the gods was defunct, and incapable of revival, when Christianity came...the whole world of antiquity either followed philosophical systems on the one hand, or worshipped the gods. But in modern times it is undesirable that all humanity should make such a fool of itself." ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{critical}} review of Very's book {{was written by}} Margaret Fuller and published in Orestes Brownson's Boston Quarterly Review; it said Very's poems had [...] "an elasticity of spirit, a genuine flow of thought, and unsought nobleness and purity", though she admitted she preferred the prose in the collection over the poetry. She mocked the [...] "sing song" [...] style of the poems and questioned his religious mission. She concluded: [...] "I am... greatly interested in Mr Very. He seems worthy to be well known." [...] James Freeman Clarke admired Very's poetry enough to have several published in his journal, the Western Messenger, between 1838 and 1840. William Ellery Channing admired Very's poetry as well, writing that his insanity [...] "is only superficial". Richard Henry Dana Sr. also commented positively on Very's poetry: [...] "The thought is deeply spiritual; and {{while there is a}} certain character of peculiarity which we so often find in like things from <b>our</b> <b>old</b> writers, there is a freedom from quaintness... Indeed, I know not where you would... find any thing in this country to compare with these Sonnets." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} with TSR, Gygax had often {{mentioned}} the mysterious Castle Greyhawk which formed the centre of his own home campaign. But despite all of his written output over the previous 30 years, Gygax had never published details of the castle. In 2003, Gygax {{announced that he was}} again partnering with Rob Kuntz to publish the original and previously unpublished details of Castle Greyhawk and the City of Greyhawk in 6 volumes, although the project would use the rules for Castles and Crusades rather than D. As Gygax wrote in an on-line forum: [...] "I have laid out a new schematic of castle and dungeon levels based on both my original design of 13 levels plus side adjuncts, and the 'New Greyhawk Castle' that resulted when Rob and I combined our efforts and added a lot of new levels too. From that Rob will draft the level plans for the newest version of the work. Meantime, I am collecting all the most salient feature, encounters, tricks, traps, etc. for inclusion on the various levels. So the end result will be what is essentially the best of <b>our</b> <b>old</b> work in a coherent presentation usable by all DMs, the material having all the known and yet to be discussed features of the original work that are outstanding... I hope." [...] Since Wizards of the Coast, which had bought TSR in 1997, still owned the rights to the name [...] "Greyhawk", Gygax changed the name of Castle Greyhawk to [...] "Castle Zagyg", a reverse homophone of his own name, and also changed the name of the nearby city to [...] "Yggsburgh", a play on his initials [...] "E.G.G." ...|$|E
