5|$|The Austrian School <b>of</b> <b>economics</b> {{began with}} Carl Menger's 1871 Principles <b>of</b> <b>Economics.</b> Menger's {{followers}} formed a distinct group of economists until around the World War II when {{the distinction between}} Austrian economics and other schools of thought had largely broken down. The Austrian tradition survived as a distinct school, however, through the works of Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek. Present-day Austrians are distinguished by their interest in earlier Austrian works and abstention from standard empirical methodology including econometrics. Austrians also focus on market processes instead of equilibrium. Mainstream economists are generally critical of its methodology.|$|E
