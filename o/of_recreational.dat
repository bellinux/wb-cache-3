40|$|Good {{educational}} environment and recreational site {{are essential to}} children's healthy growth. Taking scientific approaches to evaluate and optimize will promote the construction <b>of</b> children’s <b>recreational</b> center. This study constructed an AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) -TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution) optimization model which consisted of the following seven influential factors: site safety (x 1), amenities (x 2), physical space (x 3), activity representation (x 4), ecological environment (x 5), quality of night scene (x 6) and consideration given to supervisor (x 7). The AHP method {{was used to determine}} the weights of each factor and then the values were assigned to the sample cases in accordance with the evaluation criteria. After that, the TOPSIS was employed to sequence and optimize 28 design proposals <b>of</b> children's <b>recreational</b> center. The result showed that the decreasing order of the weight of each influential factor of the quality <b>of</b> children’s <b>recreational</b> center was x 1 >x 4 >x 2 >x 3 >x 6 >x 7 >x 5. Moreover, the sequencing of 28 design proposals had a high differentiating ability. The excellent design proposals that had been screened out were featured by a good balance between the core functions <b>of</b> the <b>recreational</b> center and other auxiliary functions. The AHP-TOPSIS combination model can provide scientific basis for optimizing the design proposal <b>of</b> children’s <b>recreational</b> center and for standardizing the construction <b>of</b> children’s <b>recreational</b> center...|$|R
