In this paper, mathematical expressions relating the frequency modulation of the laser pulse and the wakefield density profile of the plasma for <b>oblique</b> <b>crossing</b> angles are derived. Multidimensional particle-in-cell simulation results presented in this paper confirm that the frequency modulation profiles and the density modulation profiles agree to within 10 %.

40|$|Effective {{three-dimensional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) requires an accurate method for taking planar cross sections. However, if an <b>oblique</b> <b>cross</b> section is taken, the plane may not intersect any known data points. Thus, a method is needed to interpolate water density between data points. Interpolation assumes continuity of density, but there are discontinuities {{in the human body}} at the borders of different types of tissue. Most interpolation methods try to smooth these sharp borders, blurring the data and possibly destroying useful information. To capture qualitatively the key difÞculties of this problem, we created a sequence of simulated biological data sets, such as a brain and an arm, each with some speciÞc defect. Our data sets are cubic arrays with 100 elements on each side, for a total of one million elements, specifying water density at each point with an integer in the range [0, 255]. In each data set, we use differentiable functions to describe several tissue types with discontinuities between them. To analyze these data, we created a group of algorithms, implemented in C++, and compared their effectiveness in generating accurate cross sections. We used local interpolation techniques, because the data are not continuous on a global level. Our Þnal algorithm searches for discontinuities between tissues. If it Þnds one at a point, it preserves sharp edges by assigning to that point the water density of the nearest data point. If there is no discontinuity, the algorithm does a polynomial Þt in three dimensions to the nearest 64 data points and interpolates the water density...|$|E
40|$|Toric {{intraocular lenses}} (IOLs) are {{designed}} to reduce spectacle dependency by correcting corneal astigmatism {{at the time of}} surgery. However, these IOLs are reliant on the accurate prediction of post-operative corneal astigmatism through reliable ocular biometry and the accurate calculation of surgically induced astigmatism. In the thesis the repeatability of assessing corneal curvature was assessed using six commercially available keratometers. The results question the validity of corneal biometry and infer that much of the apparent change in corneal shape usually associated with surgically induced astigmatism may be due to measurement error. The use of the <b>oblique</b> <b>cross</b> cylinder formulae for the calculation of post-operative corneal curvature was also investigated. This formula is incorporated into all commercially available toric IOL calculators and is utilised in every toric IOL implantation. The results from this thesis indicate that the formula is not applicable to the human cornea and that the use of the calculator does not increase the effectivity of the toric correction. Furthermore, the thesis queries the assumption that post-operative corneal astigmatism is directly proportional to post-operative refractive error. The disparity between both the magnitude and axis of astigmatism measured by keratometry and manifest refraction in a pseudophakic population was investigated. The axis measurements in particular showed very poor agreement; far outside an acceptable level of misalignment, significantly decreasing the effective correction provided if the lens was aligned with the keratometry readings. Inclusion of the posterior corneal curvature and thickness, along with a smaller chord length may lead to a more accurate assessment of corneal power. Despite the difficulty in providing an effective toric IOL correction, {{it was found that the}} correction of corneal astigmatism at the time of cataract surgery might decrease the risks of falls. Uncorrected astigmatism and cataract both cause a reduction in stability when stepping oven an obstacle, which is one of the most common causes of trips and falls in the elderly population.

40|$|The Neoproterozoic outcrop belt of the Death Valley region, California, {{preserves}} an <b>oblique</b> <b>cross</b> {{section of}} the Noonday Formation, a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic platform that hosts distinctive basal Ediacaran cap carbonate−affiliated sedimentary structures, stromatolite textures, and δ^(13) C_(carb) values. The Noonday platform encompasses two depositional sequences that reveal two cycles of relative sea-level change within strata conventionally considered to record a single, rapid, postglacial sea-level rise. In updip localities, facies of the first depositional sequence record {{the transition from a}} carbonate ramp to a stromatolite-bearing, “tubestone”-textured, reef-rimmed platform; downdip, localities seaward of the reefal escarpment variably preserve a thin and condensed onlapping foreslope wedge. Base-level fall exposed the reef crest to karstic dissolution and propagated submarine incised valleys into the seaward margin of the reef. Overlying strata record the backfilling of a submarine incised valley and reestablishment of a back-stepping, carbonate-dominated ramp prior to a second subaerial exposure event that defines the contact between the Noonday and Johnnie formations. We address the relative contributions of syndepositional tectonism and recovery from low-latitude deglaciation in dictating Noonday platform architecture and the intra−Noonday Formation sequence boundary. Noonday Formation deposition coincided with extension of the Laurentian margin during disaggregation of the Rodinian supercontinent. Within this framework, previous work has suggested that the intra−Noonday Formation sequence boundary records growth faulting that reinforced differential topography, uplifting reef-rimmed horsts—exposing the reef crest to karstic dissolution—and downdropping grabens. However, we trace the intra−Noonday Formation sequence boundary seaward of the reef crest and demonstrate that, for a time, wave base was situated downdip of the reef escarpment on putatively downdropped fault blocks. Thus, if the Noonday margin were undergoing extension, then the creation of the intra−Noonday Formation sequence boundary required a concomitant decrease in accommodation due, perhaps, to postglacial isostatic uplift attendant with low-latitude deglaciation. We speculate that Noonday Formation sequence architecture records (1) immediate deglacial flooding, (2) shoaling and exposure due to isostatic rebound induced by either a hiatus in meltwater flux or rapid ice-sheet collapse against a background of global deglaciation, and (3) resumed flooding following complete deglaciation. As rift-related tectonism could amplify or counter glacial isostasy, inferences of the amplitude of local postglacial sea-level change will require robust estimates of syndepositional extension across the Noonday margin...|$|E

U-Pb zircon ages indicate that in the deposit area felsic magmatic activity took place between 116. 7 ± 0. 4 and 114. 5 ± 1 Ma, defining a new Raúl-Condestable superunit, the oldest so far, of the Peruvian Coastal batholith. This superunit is located west of {{the main part of the}} batholith and includes a dacite-andesite volcanic dome and a subvolcanic quartz-diorite porphyry sill-dike complex that were emplaced at 116. 7 ± 0. 4 and 116. 4 ± 0. 3 Ma, respectively, followed by tonalite stocks and dikes emplaced between 115. 1 ± 0. 4 and 114. 5 ± 1 Ma. All these rocks contain hornblende and/or biotite but no pyroxene and correspond to silica- and waterrich magmas following a calcic differentiation trend. Hf isotope data on zircons (εHf(115 Ma) = 5. 2 – 7. 5) and Pb isotope data on whole rock, combined with lithogeochemical results, suggest that magmas were generated by partial melting of the upper mantle, enriched through hydrous metasomatism and/or melting of subducted pelagic sediments. The lack of zircon inheritance suggests that there was no direct involvement of continental crust. The Raúl-Condestable IOCG deposit is connected in space and time with the magmatism of the Raúl- Condestable superunit. The mineralization was emplaced in the core of the dacite-andesite volcanic dome at a paleodepth of 2 to 3 km, surrounding two tonalitic intrusions formed at 115. 1 ± 0. 4 and 114. 8 ± 0. 4 Ma. The U-Pb age of hydrothermal titanite from IOCG veins at 115. 2 ± 0. 3 Ma indicates that the mineralization was coeval with (or more probably just followed) the emplacement of the tonalites. Re-Os geochronology on molybdenite did not yield reliable ages due to apparent Re loss. Copper ore is associated with a zoned alteration pattern, which surrounds the tonalite intrusions. It consists of a core of biotite alteration and quartz stockwork,grading outward to actinolite (±magnetite, ±chlorite, ±titanite, ±scapolite, ±albite, ±epidote) and upward to sericite + Fe chlorite alteration. An upper distal alteration halo consisting of hematite-chlorite surrounds the sericite + Fe chlorite and actinolite alterations laterally. Most of the ore is spatially associated with the actinolite alteration and, to a lesser extent, with the sericite + Fe chlorite alteration. The results of this study confirm that the 110 to 120 Ma age range was a productive time period for Andean IOCG deposits. The characterization of the hydrous intermediate magmatism related to the mineralization, as well as the subvolcanic position of the deposit and its related alteration pattern provides further criteria that may be used when exploring for IOCG deposits in a convergent plate tectonic setting...|$|E
