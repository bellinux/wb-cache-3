40|$|In 1999 general {{assistance}} recipients in New York City {{were required}} {{to participate in a}} job training and <b>outplacement</b> <b>assistance</b> program. Initially, recipients were enrolled in ‘waves’ due to capacity constraints. The program’s impact is identified using a quasiexperiment in which selectees are compared to concomitantly eligible non-selectees. Selectees are 15 percentage points more likely to start a job and 10 percentage points more likely to exit welfare than are non-selectees. This methodology is important since random-assignment experiments can be costly and difficult to implement. Further, experiments are not impervious to criticism; this procedure addresses three of five known shortcomings...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{workforce}} reduction practices in four Hong Kong companies and evaluates {{the impact on}} the organizations and the affected employees. Most companies are found efficient in implementing workforce reduction. Though these companies meet the legal requirements of the Hong Kong law in mass layoffs, yet they are not very socially responsible. Managements make efforts in developing selection mechanism, communication channels, and motivating survivors, which are essential to maintain normal productivity of the companies. They however neglect other key steps in managing workforce reduction including exploring options to avoid layoffs and providing adequate <b>outplacement</b> <b>assistance</b> to departing employees. </span...|$|E
40|$|Starting in 1999, welfare {{recipients}} {{were required to}} participate in a job training and <b>outplacement</b> <b>assistance</b> program. Initially, recipients were enrolled in biweekly waves. I identify the effect of the program using an innovative natural experiment in which enrollees are compared to concomitantly eligible, non-enrolled recipients. Adjusting for control group contamination, I find that enrollees were over thirteen percentage points more likely to start a job. The strong majority of the newly employed remained off welfare for at least two years. Observed differences were not due to “creaming,” macroeconomic shocks, or measurement error. The program passes a cost benefit test...|$|E
40|$|Three to {{five years}} after job displacements, workers {{receiving}} the advance notice mandated by current law earn approximately 10 percent more than their nonnotified counterparts. This differential is {{not the result of}} firms systematically notifying persons with favorable reemployment prospects [...] early warnings are disproportionately obtained by individuals expected to earn relatively low wages in subsequent employment. It is not clear, however, whether renotification has a causal effect. The notification differential may occur because the advance notice is frequently provided by employers offering other kinds of adjustment assistance, such as job counseling, skill retraining, supplemental unemployment benefits, or <b>outplacement</b> <b>assistance.</b> Copyright 1994 by University of Chicago Press. ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} employees ’ reactions to a voluntary sever-ance program (VSP). Results generally supported {{a model that}} links perceptions of justice-based attributes (adequacy of outplacement help; consistency, objectivity, and ethicality of procedures) with affective commitment and intentions to leave. We also considered the main and moderating effects of a particular voluntary severance outcome, eligi-bility. Eligibility was associated with both commitment and turnover intentions, and moderated the effect of perceived adequacy of outplace-ment help on turnover intentions, {{as well as the}} effect of perceived procedural fairness on commitment. Control variables representing demographics (age), perceived fairness of a previous early retirement program, and anticipation of future layoffs also significantly influenced both outcomes. Implications for future research and for management are discussed. Workforce reductions have become a predominant feature of the organizational landscape. Research has documented characteristics of these programs that influ-ence the attitudes of both departing and remaining employees. Departing employ-ees react more favorably when advance notification, outplacement services, severance pay, and extended benefits are provided (Konovsky & Folger, 1991; Leana & Feldman, 1992). Remaining employees react more favorably when they perceive that their departing colleagues were treated fairly through adequate care-taking (e. g., severance pay, <b>outplacement</b> <b>assistance,</b> continuation of benefits) and when clear and adequate explanations were offered (c. f. Brockner, 1988, 1990...|$|E
