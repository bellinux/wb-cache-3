5|$|Although the {{hurricane}} season {{is defined as}} beginning on June1 and ending on November30, {{there have been several}} <b>off-season</b> storms. Since 1870, there have been 32 <b>off-season</b> cyclones, 18 of which occurred in May. In the same time span, nine storms formed in December, two in April, and one each in January, February and March. During four years (1887, 1953, 2003, and 2007), tropical cyclones formed in the North Atlantic Ocean both during or before May and during December. In 1887, four storms occurred outside the season, the most in a single year. High vertical wind shear and low sea surface temperatures generally preclude tropical cyclone formation during the <b>off-season.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Off-season</b> {{cyclones}} {{are most}} likely to occur in the central to western Atlantic Ocean, and most do not make landfall. Of the storms that did strike land, most affected areas surrounding the Caribbean Sea. Cumulatively, at least 398deaths occurred due to the storms, primarily on the islands of Hispaniola and Cuba; a tropical storm in May 1948 struck the Dominican Republic to become the deadliest <b>off-season</b> storm. However, an unofficial hurricane in 1863 killed 110people, in a shipwreck off Florida and on land. The same storm was estimated to have reached winds of 105mph (165km/h), making it the strongest hurricane between December to May; the strongest currently in the official database was a March hurricane in 1908 that reached winds of 100mph (160km/h). In addition, the strongest <b>off-season</b> cyclone to make landfall in the United States was Tropical Storm Beryl in 2012, which made landfall near Jacksonville Beach, Florida with 65mph (100km/h) winds. The most recent <b>off-season</b> storm was Tropical Storm Arlene in April 2017.|$|E

Several others had three tropical cyclones, of which only 2003 had three tropical storms. The 1908 and 1951 seasons were the only ones with two hurricanes forming in the <b>off-season.</b> In seven seasons, there were storms both {{prior to the start of}} the season as well as after the season ended, those being 1887, 1911, 1951, 1953, 1954, 2003, and 2007; all but 1911 had tropical cyclones of at least tropical storm status before and after the season.|$|E
5|$|An <b>off-season</b> Atlantic {{hurricane}} is {{a recorded}} tropical or subtropical cyclone {{that existed in}} the Atlantic basin outside of the official Atlantic hurricane season. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration currently defines the season as occurring between June 1 and November 30 each calendar year, which is when 97% of all Atlantic tropical cyclones occur. Peak activity is known to be between August and October. In the <b>off-season,</b> storms are most likely to occur in May, with approximately 60% of such storms occurring during that month. Occasionally, however, storms develop in or persist until December. As of , there have been 81 <b>off-season</b> cyclones in the Atlantic hurricane database, which began in 1851.
