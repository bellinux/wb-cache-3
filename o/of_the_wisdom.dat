5|$|Gulfton {{residents}} are zoned to Margaret Long Wisdom High School (formerly Robert E. Lee High School), {{which opened in}} 1962 to relieve Lamar High School, with Lamar and Westside high schools as options. Most Gulfton high school-aged residents attend Wisdom High School. When it opened, Wisdom High School had mainly affluent white students; its demographics shifted to a mostly Hispanic and immigrant student body. In September 1991 Wisdom was one of 32 HISD schools that had capped enrollments, and excess students had to attend other schools. When Westside opened in 2000, residents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wisdom</b> attendance boundary gained the option to attend Westside instead of Wisdom, with no free transportation provided. By 2004 three {{out of every four}} Wisdom students were born to non-English-speaking households.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1960s, {{there was a}} growing {{awareness}} {{of the benefits of}} retaining the canal. The Inland Waterways Association produced a report, entitled The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal - Waterway with a Future, suggesting that the canal had the potential for development as a linear Country Park, and the County Planning Officer for Somerset County Council produced a second report, suggesting that funds should be made available for maintenance and restoration, which the County Council duly adopted. The Countryside Act 1968 provided a framework for such action, and a visit in 1971 to see the work being done on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal as part of the creation of the Brecon Beacons National Park convinced the Council <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> of such a course of action. By 1974, Higher and Lower Maunsel locks, which are listed buildings, had been refurbished by the British Waterways Board, with funding from the County Council. Funding for towpath maintenance and weed cutting was also provided.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Grant {{began his}} {{relationship}} with Skoob Books Limited, a publisher linked to the Skoob Books bookstore in Bloomsbury, central London which had begun to develop a line of esoteric titles {{under the leadership of}} Caroline Wise and Chris Johnson. In 1991, Skoob Books published Grant's Remembering Aleister Crowley, a volume containing his memoirs of Crowley alongside reproductions of diary entries, photographs, and letters. From 1989 to 1994, Skoob reissued a number of Grant's earlier books, and in 1992 published the sixth volume in the Typhonian Trilogies, Hecate's Fountain, in which Grant provided many anecdotes about working in the New Isis Lodge and focused on describing accidents and fatalities that he believed were caused by magic. The seventh volume of the Typhonian Trilogies, Outer Gateways, followed in 1994, discussing Grant's ideas of older Typhonian traditions from across the world, with reference to the work of Crowley, Spare, and Lovecraft. It ends with the text <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wisdom</b> of S'lba, a work that Grant claimed he had received clairvoyantly from a supernatural source.|$|E

25|$|The Tathāgatagarbha is {{the topic}} of the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras, where the title itself means a garbha (womb, matrix, seed) {{containing}} Tathagata (Buddha). In the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras sutras the perfection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> of not-self is stated to be the true self. The ultimate goal of the path is characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by essentialist philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.|$|E
25|$|The {{small round}} brush head {{comprises}} seven tufts of tightly packed soft nylon bristles, trimmed so the bristles {{in the center}} can reach deeper into small spaces. The brush handle is ergonomically designed for a firm grip, giving the control and precision necessary to clean where most other cleaning aids cannot reach. These areas include the posterior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> teeth (third molars), orthodontic structures (braces), crowded teeth, and tooth surfaces that are next to missing teeth. It {{can also be used}} to clean areas around implants, bridges, dentures and other appliances.|$|E
25|$|Astrology (the {{operation}} of the stars): Hermes claims that Zoroaster discovered this part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> of the whole universe, astrology, and taught it to man. In Hermetic thought, {{it is likely that}} the movements of the planets have meaning beyond the laws of physics and actually hold metaphorical value as symbols in the mind of The All, or God. Astrology has influences upon the Earth, but does not dictate our actions, and wisdom is gained when we know what these influences are and how to deal with them.|$|E

25|$|In {{the high}} Renaissance, in fact, {{there was a}} hope that more direct {{knowledge}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> of antiquity, including {{the writings of the}} Church fathers, the earliest known Greek texts of the Christian Gospels, and in some cases even the Jewish Kabbalah, would initiate a harmonious new era of universal agreement. With this end in view, Renaissance Church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought. One humanist, the Greek Orthodox Platonist Gemistus Pletho (1355–1452), based in Mystras, Greece (but in contact with humanists in Florence, Venice, and Rome) taught a Christianised version of pagan polytheism.|$|E
25|$|Ashurbanipal {{was proud}} of his scribal education. He asserts this in the statement: “I Assurbanipal within , took care <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> of Nebo, the whole of the inscribed tablets, of all the clay tablets, the whole of their mysteries and difficulties, I solved.”. He {{was one of the few}} kings who could read the {{cuneiform}} script in Akkadian and Sumerian, and claimed that he even read texts from before the great flood. He was also able to solve mathematical problems. During his reign, he collected cuneiform texts from all over Mesopotamia, especially Babylonia, in the library of Nineveh.|$|E
25|$|The earlier form Yehoshua did not disappear, however, and {{remained}} in use as well. In the post-exilic books, Joshua {{the son of}} Nun is called both Yeshua bin-Nun (Nehemiah 8:17) and Yehoshua (I Chronicles 7:27). The short form Yeshua was used for Jesus ben Sirach in Hebrew fragments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wisdom</b> of Sirach. (Some concern remains over whether these fragments faithfully represent the original Hebrew text or are instead a later translation back into Hebrew.) The earlier form Yehoshua saw revived usage from the Hasmonean period onwards, although the name Yeshua is still found in letters {{from the time of}} the Bar Kokhba Revolt (132–135 AD).|$|E

25|$|The {{modern era}} {{generally}} remembers Lamarck for {{a theory of}} inheritance of acquired characteristics, called soft inheritance, Lamarckism or use/disuse theory, which he described in his 1809 Philosophie Zoologique. However, his idea of soft inheritance was, perhaps, a reflection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> of the time accepted by many natural historians. Lamarck's contribution to evolutionary theory consisted of the first truly cohesive theory of biological evolution, in which an alchemical complexifying force drove organisms up a ladder of complexity, and a second environmental force adapted them to local environments through use and disuse of characteristics, differentiating them from other organisms. Scientists have debated whether advances {{in the field of}} transgenerational epigenetics mean that Lamarck was to an extent correct, or not.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the period}} of these sūtras, Mahāyāna metaphysics was {{dominated}} by teachings on emptiness, {{in the form of}} Madhyamaka philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the Buddha nature genre of sūtras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of dependent origination and on the mysterious reality of nirvana using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism. In these sūtras the perfection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by essentialist philosophers, but was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary that described a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.|$|E
25|$|The Dutch land {{forces were}} less {{amenable}} to the Prince's powers of persuasion, and neither was {{the civilian population}} in North Holland. If anything, {{the effect of the}} invasion was to unify the divided Republic against the invader. The Prince's arrogant proclamation, peremptorily ordering the Dutch people to rally to Orange, was also not calculated to convince the Dutch <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wisdom</b> of a restoration of the Stadholderate. It was therefore not surprising that the call for an uprising by the old Stadtholder himself from Lingen met with indifference by the people. A motley band of Orangist émigrés at the Westervoortsche Bridge near Arnhem, was easily put to flight on September 4 by a small detachment of the Batavian National Guard, proving that the invaders had to do the work themselves. Other Orangist incursions in the eastern Netherlands and Friesland met with even less success. Nevertheless, the Uitvoerend Bewind of the Batavian Republic declared martial law and under these emergency measures an aristocratic partisan of the stadtholder, the freule (baroness) Judith Van Dorth tot Holthuizen was convicted of sedition and executed.|$|E
50|$|Akshobhya is {{sometimes}} merged with Acala (Fudō-myōō), whose name also means 'immovable one' in Sanskrit. However, Acala {{is not a}} buddha, but one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Five <b>Wisdom</b> Kings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Womb Realm in Vajrayana.|$|R

2500|$|The Septuagint {{translates}} {{the phrase}} [...] (Malakh YHWH [...] "Messenger of Yahweh") as ἄγγελος Κυρίου (angelos Kyriou, [...] "angel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lord").
