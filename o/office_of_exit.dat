40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} innovation on the risk <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> <b>of</b> a firm, distinguishing between different modes <b>of</b> <b>exits.</b> Innovation represents a resource and a capability that helps a firm to build competitive advantage and remain in the market. At the same time, the resources and capabilities of innovative firms make them an attractive target for the acquisition process of other firms, thereby increasing the likelihood <b>of</b> the <b>exiting</b> the market. We explore these effects empirically by linking data on innovation and exits for a large sample of manufacturing firms in the Netherlands. The {{results show that the}} effect of innovation on a firm's risk <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> differs according to the mode <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> and, in addition, it is shaped {{by the nature of the}} innovation. While a firm can lower its risk of failure by innovating in either products or processes, the introduction of a new product in the absence of innovation in the production process increases the risk <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> as a result of merger and acquisition.

40|$|In my Master's thesis I {{discuss a}} {{relatively}} new topic in the discussion on multiculturalism in political philosophy, the right <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> from a religious or a cultural group. Liberal theorists agree {{on the fact that}} everyone should be free to leave their group, to have a right to exit. However, they disagree on the content of the right. I present two schools on the topic: the formal right <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> strategy by Chandran Kukathas and the realistic right <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> strategy by Susan Moller Okin. I also view the importance of the individual's right to voice. I try to answer to a question which is twofold: whether the formal right <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> strategy is enough for protecting the freedom of individuals belonging to groups or whether the real abilities to exit should be considered as well, and whether everyone should also have a right to voice. In my work I compare the view of Kukathas with that of Okin. My main sources are Kukathas's book, The Liberal Archipelago. A Theory of Diversity and Freedom (2003) and Okin's article Mistresses of Their Own Destiny? Group Rights, Gender, and Realistic Right <b>of</b> <b>Exit</b> (2002). I also discuss what is often pictured as an alternative or supplement to exit, namely voice. By it is meant the right of the dissenters in the groups to express their views and try to reform their groups accordingly. Regarding to voice, my main source is a book Exit, Voice, and Loyalty (1970) by Albert O. Hirschman. I also cover minors and exit, as well as the so called costs <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> and voice. I show that whereas Okin thinks everyone should have certain capacities to exit, Kukathas objects it is irrelevant to consider them. Okin claims girls and women often lack these capacities. She argues they are for this reason not substantively free to leave their groups, nor in an equal position with men to exercise the right <b>of</b> <b>exit.</b> Therefore the formal right <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> strategy should be rejected. I claim that the debate between Kukathas and Okin comes back to a broader one in liberalism, namely on the question of which is the fundamental value in liberalism: toleration or autonomy. Kukathas stresses the former, Okin the latter. I {{come to the conclusion that}} in order to protect the freedom of all, the formal right <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> strategy should be abandoned in favor of the realistic right <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> strategy. Regarding to voice, along the right <b>of</b> <b>exit,</b> everyone should also have a right to voice. Keywords right <b>of</b> <b>exit,</b> groups, liberalism, autonomy, toleration, voic...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship between amount <b>of</b> <b>exited</b> blood during wet-cupping with patient’s individual conditions and the time it was performed. Instruments & Methods In this descriptive cross-sectional study, 391 men who were referred to a cupping center in Saveh city in the spring of 2016, were selected by simple sampling and wet-cupping in the position between the two scapula was performed. The research instrument was a questionnaire including demographic characteristics, date of reference (day, month and year), age, height, weight and amount <b>of</b> <b>exited</b> blood during the wet-cupping in gram. Data were analyzed by SPSS 16 software and using chi-square test, paired t test and one-way analysis of variance. Findings The means of age, weight and body mass index were significantly related to the mean <b>of</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>exited</b> blood during wet-cupping (p 0. 05), but the amount <b>of</b> <b>exited</b> blood was higher in people with previous history of wet-cupping than those without previous history (p< 0. 001).

40|$|It {{has been}} widely {{recognized}} that the <b>exit</b> geometry <b>of</b> circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers may have significant effects on the hydrodynamics of gas-solid flow. However, a systematical study <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> effect is still lack after extensive experimental studies, possibly {{due to the fact}} that systematical modification <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> geometry in experimental study is an expensive and time-consuming task. In this study, after further validation of the recently developed EMMS-based two-fluid model (Wang et al., 2012. Chem. Eng. Sci. 75, 349 - 358; Zhou et al., 2014. Chem. Eng. Sci. 107, 206 - 217), the model is used to systematically investigate the effect <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> geometry <b>of</b> high-density CFB risers, fully taking the advantage that bed geometry can be easily modified in computational fluid dynamics study. It is shown that (i) the type <b>of</b> <b>exit</b> has a significant effect on hydrodynamics, the use <b>of</b> abrupt <b>exit</b> results in an increased solids concentration, not only in the immediate vicinity <b>of</b> the <b>exit</b> but also for a considerable distance down to the riser; (ii) the cavity height <b>of</b> abrupt <b>exit,</b> the curvature diameter <b>of</b> smooth <b>exit</b> and the length of the horizontal tube connecting the exit and the primary cyclone only have a minor effect or have no influence on the bed hydrodynamics of the studied risers; (iii) more importantly, the decrease of the diameter <b>of</b> abrupt <b>exit</b> tube results in a remarkable increase of solids holdup, the symmetry of radial solids concentration near the exit can also be enhanced significantly. However, in case <b>of</b> smooth <b>exit,</b> the diameter <b>of</b> the <b>exit</b> tube has no effect on the bed hydrodynamics at all. All of those results are in agreement with conclusions obtained from previous experimental studies, thus offering further validation of the EMMS-based two-fluid model for modelling heterogeneous gas-solid flow.
