5|$|Alcibiades first rose to {{prominence}} {{when he began}} advocating aggressive Athenian action after {{the signing of the}} Peace of Nicias. That treaty, an uneasy truce between Sparta and Athens signed midway through the Peloponnesian War, came at the end of seven years of fighting during which neither side had gained a decisive advantage. Historians Arnold W. Gomme and Raphael Sealey believe, and Thucydides reports, that Alcibiades was offended that the Spartans had negotiated that treaty through Nicias and Laches, overlooking him on account <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>youth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Born in Versailles, Kentucky, to a Southern white minister, Parrish spent parts <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>youth</b> {{living in}} Alabama and Georgia. His birthplace is often listed {{as being in}} nearby Lexington, Kentucky. He {{graduated}} from Cullman High School, Cullman, Alabama in 1924 and Rice Institute, Houston, Texas in 1928. He dropped out of graduate school after one year and decided to hitchhike to San Francisco. The lack of work meant hunger, so he chose to join the United States Army's 11th Cavalry Regiment as a private on July 30, 1930, serving in Monterey, California.|$|E
5|$|Crawford {{originally}} created Frog Fractions {{to entertain}} his friends, {{and to see}} their reactions when they first played it. Later on, he felt that with the indie genre taking off, Frog Fractions was taken more seriously among gamers. Crawford noted that although critics often described the game as a satire on old educational games, he never intentionally developed Frog Fractions with that in mind. Instead, Crawford explained that Frog Fractions had an educational theme because of the name's alliteration, and because he considered educational games a part <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>youth.</b>|$|E

5|$|North of Bloor Street, {{the wide}} valley floor became {{dominated}} by industrial {{concerns of the}} Taylor family, including the Don Valley Brick Works. The area from the Forks of the Don and north along the river valleys had been lumbered and farmed, such as at Milne Hollow, but several natural areas remained by the 1950s. The forests of the Don valley had been where Canadian naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton spent much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>youth</b> in the 1870s studying animal life.|$|E

Both Crassus and Pompey returned to Rome with their legions and refused to disband them, instead encamping outside Rome. Both men stood for the consulship of 70 BC, even though Pompey was ineligible because <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>youth</b> and lack of service as praetor or quaestor. Nonetheless, both men were elected consul for 70 BC, {{partly due to the}} implied threat of their armed legions encamped outside the city.|$|E

5|$|Smetana had {{virtually}} no precursors in Czech opera apart from František Škroup, whose works had rarely lasted beyond one or two performances. In his mission {{to create a new}} canon, rather than using traditional folksong Smetana turned to the popular dance music <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>youth,</b> especially the polka, to establish his link with the vernacular. He drew on existing European traditions, notably Slavonic and French, but made only scarce use of arias, preferring to base his scores on ensembles and choruses.|$|E
5|$|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's operas {{comprise}} 22 musical dramas in {{a variety}} of genres. They range from the small-scale, derivative works <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>youth</b> to the full-fledged operas of his maturity. Three of the works were abandoned before completion and were not performed until many years after the composer's death. His mature works are all considered classics and have never been out of the repertory of the world's opera houses.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Usama was {{the second}} of four boys and raised by his nurse, Lu'lu'a, who had also raised his father and would later raise Usama's own children. He was {{encouraged}} by his father to memorize the Qur'an, and was also tutored by scholars such as Ibn Munira of Kafartab and Abu Abdullah al-Tulaytuli of Toledo. He spent much <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>youth</b> hunting with his family, partly as recreation and certainly as warrior (faris) training for battle as part of furusiyya. He also had much direct experience of battle, against the neighbouring crusader County of Tripoli and Principality of Antioch, hostile Muslim neighbours in Hama, Homs, and elsewhere, and Hashshashin who had established a base near Shaizar.|$|E

5|$|He {{was born}} in Sandymount, Ireland and educated there and in London. He spent {{childhood}} holidays in County Sligo and studied poetry {{from an early age}} when he became fascinated by Irish legends and the occult. These topics feature in the first phase of his work, which lasted roughly until the turn of the 20th century. His earliest volume of verse was published in 1889, and its slow-paced and lyrical poems display Yeats's debts to Edmund Spenser, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and the poets of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. From 1900, his poetry grew more physical and realistic. He largely renounced the transcendental beliefs <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>youth,</b> though he remained preoccupied with physical and spiritual masks, as well as with cyclical theories of life. In 1923, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature.|$|E
5|$|Æthelfrith, who was {{for years}} a {{successful}} war-leader, especially against the native British, was eventually killed in battle around 616 by Raedwald of East Anglia at the River Idle. This defeat meant that an exiled {{member of the}} Deiran royal line, Edwin (Acha's brother), became king of Northumbria, and Oswald and his brothers fled to the north. Oswald thus spent the remainder <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>youth</b> in the Scottish kingdom of Dál Riata in northern Britain, where he was converted to Christianity. He may also have fought in Ireland {{during this period of}} exile. It has been considered that Oswald is one of the three Saxon princes mentioned in the Irish poem Togail Bruidne Dá Derga, being named as 'Osalt' in that work.|$|E
5|$|Arafat {{was born}} to Palestinian parents in Cairo, Egypt, where he spent most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>youth</b> and studied at the University of King Fuad I. While a student, he embraced Arab {{nationalist}} and anti-Zionist ideas. Opposed to the 1948 creation of the State of Israel, he fought alongside the Muslim Brotherhood during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Returning to Cairo, he {{served as president of}} the General Union of Palestinian Students from 1952 to 1956. In the latter part of the 1950s he co-founded Fatah, a paramilitary organisation seeking the disestablishment of Israel and its replacement with a Palestinian state. Fatah operated within several Arab countries, from where it launched attacks on Israeli targets. In the latter part of the 1960s Arafat's profile grew; in 1967 he joined the PLO and in 1969 was elected chair of the Palestinian National Council (PNC). Fatah's growing presence in Jordan resulted in military clashes with King Hussein's Jordanian government and in the early 1970s it relocated to Lebanon. There, Fatah assisted the Lebanese National Movement during the Lebanese Civil War and continued its attacks on Israel, resulting in it becoming a major target of Israel's 1978 and 1982 invasions.|$|E
