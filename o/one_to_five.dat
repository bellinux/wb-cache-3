5|$|For safety, Kings Island uses a ride {{rating system}} that classifies the attractions {{based on the}} {{intensity}} of the ride. The ratings vary from one, for rides that are calm and gentle, to five, for rides that have high speeds, aggressive forces, and rapid elevation changes. A separate set of ride ratings criteria is used for attractions inside Soak City, though the rides are still rated on a scale from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>five.</b>|$|E
5|$|Two {{or three}} oval white eggs, laid {{two to three}} days apart, are most {{commonly}} laid in a clutch, though there can be anywhere from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>five.</b> They average 41.6mm long by 35.5mm wide, and are finely pitted. The female alone incubates the eggs, during which time she is fed by the male. She does leave the nest at dusk for around half an hour, sometimes to bathe. Incubation takes 30–31 days.|$|E

5|$|Aker Stadion {{has been}} {{proposed}} used during the annual Moldejazz, Norway's largest jazz festival, but this has been rejected several times by the festival management. The issue was intensified in 2004, when a much smaller arena was used for a quickly sold-out Stevie Wonder concert. On 6 October 2007, StatoilHydro arranged a free concert at the stadium with Ane Brun and Röyksopp to celebrate the completion of their near-by processing plant for the gas field Ormen Lange. In a 2012 survey {{carried out by the}} Norwegian Players' Association among away-team captains, Ullevaal was found to be the league's fourth-best stadium, with a score of 4.27 on a scale from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>five.</b>|$|E
5|$|As {{construction}} {{of schools and}} hiring of teachers continued in Ravalomanana's second term, additional measures were adopted to improve education quality, including a shift to Malagasy as the language of instruction in grades <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>five,</b> expansion of primary schools to house grades six and seven for greater access to lower secondary schooling and {{an overhaul of the}} national curriculum, which had been modified piecemeal since independence from France in 1960. In the Constitution of 2007, English was added to Malagasy and French as an official language, in reflection of Ravalomanana's goal to increase Madagascar's participation in the global market.|$|E
5|$|Charles W. Holliday and Joseph R. Coelho {{devised a}} new key in 2004 to {{identify}} the Sphecius species, examining 4,451 wasps among the five New World species, and noting that 98% of the female S. convallis wasps examined had yellow markings on gastral tergites one to four (or fewer) and S.grandis had 98% yellow markings from tergites <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> (or more). The 2% percent of S.grandis that overlapped with S.convallis were determined by density of the punctation in colour of the first tergum against the second. The markings on S.grandis males {{were found to be}} the same as on females.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{of the end}} stands {{started in}} January 2001, and they were {{completed}} in November. The demolition of the 1962 stand started on 24 October 2001, and the new stand was completed on 30 September 2002. The cost of constructing the new Lerkendal, including all four stands from 1996 to 2002, was NOK335 million, of which NOK253 million was for the 2001 and 2002 work. To give optimal conditions for the turf, the corners were not built out and the south stand was built with a transparent roof. However, the harsh climate forced the turf to be replaced two years later. In a 2012 survey {{carried out by the}} Norwegian Players' Association among away-team captains, Lerkendal was found to be the league's second-best stadium, with a score of 4,40 on a scale from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>five.</b>|$|E
5|$|Details {{of giant}} otter {{reproduction}} and life cycle are scarce, and captive animals have provided {{much of the}} information. Females appear to give birth year round, although in the wild, births may peak during the dry season. The estrous cycle is 21 days, with females receptive to sexual advances between three and 10 days. Study of captive specimens has found only males initiate copulation. At Tierpark Hagenbeck in Germany, long-term pair bonding and individualized mate selection were seen, with copulation most frequently taking place in water. Females have a gestation period of 65 to 70 days, giving birth to <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> pups, {{with an average of}} two. Research over five years on a breeding pair at the Cali Zoo in Colombia found the average interval between litters was six to seven months, but as short as 77 days when the previous litter did not survive. Other sources have found greater intervals, with as long as 21 to 33 months suggested for otters in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Like {{previous}} {{games in}} the Mana series, Children of Mana features a top-down perspective, in which the player characters navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The player controls a main character, chosen from one of four options. Each of the characters have different ratings from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> in four areas: the damage they do with magic, the speed that they can attack, {{and the amount of}} health and mana they have. The game plays out nearly identically regardless of which character is chosen, except for a few quests specific to each character. Unlike previous {{games in the}} series, the main character typically has no companions during the game; however, a cooperative multiplayer option is present for up to four players, who all appear on each player's screens. This multiplayer mode is only present with local WiFi, and progress is only saved on the host player's game.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} season is August to January {{with one or}} two broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by hopping around the area. Unlike other robins, the female sometimes initiates the site selection. A pair spends anywhere from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> days looking before finding a suitable site. The female constructs the nest alone. Eucalypts are generally chosen, but birds have been recorded nesting in Pinus radiata on Mount Wellington in Tasmania. The flame robin is more versatile in its selection of nesting sites than other robins, and has even been recorded nesting in sheds.|$|E
5|$|DJ Hero 2 is {{the sequel}} to DJ Hero, a spinoff of the Guitar Hero series. DJ Hero 2 was {{developed}} by FreeStyleGames, published by Activision and released worldwide in October 2010 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii consoles. Like its predecessor, DJ Hero 2 simulates turntablism, the playing of two songs in mix, using a special turntable-based controller that includes the ability to crossfade between the two songs, and scratching the recording. Players are challenged to match these actions, shown through on-screen scrolling indicators in synchronization with the mix; correct actions boost the player's score, while correctly performing several consecutive actions can increase the player's scoring multiplier. Specifically marked sections of songs allow the player to freestyle through crossfading, scratching, or inserting music samples into the mix. The player is not penalized for failing to perform actions. The goal is to obtain a high score for each mix, earning the player a star rating from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>five,</b> which helps to advance the player's progress through the game.|$|E
5|$|Figs have {{complicated}} inflorescences called syconia. Flowers {{are entirely}} contained within an enclosed structure. Their only {{connection with the}} outside is through a small pore called ostiole. Monoecious figs like F. aurea have {{both male and female}} flowers within the syconium. Female flowers mature first. Once mature, they produce a volatile chemical attractant. Female wasps squeeze their way through the ostiole into the interior of the syconium. Inside the syconium, they pollinate the flowers, lay their eggs in some of them, and die. The eggs hatch and the larvae parasitise the flowers in which they were laid. After four to seven weeks (in F. aurea), adult wasps emerge. Males emerge first, mate with the females, and cut exit holes through the walls of the fig. The male flowers mature around {{the same time as the}} female wasps emerge. The newly emerged female wasps actively pack their bodies with pollen from the male flowers before leaving through the exit holes the males have cut and fly off to find a syconium in which to lay their eggs. Over the next <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>five</b> days, figs ripen. The ripe figs are eaten by various mammals and birds which disperse the seeds.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, team-owner Per Berg {{stated that}} Lillestrøm SK {{would be in}} need of a new venue and {{indicated}} that one could be built at Kjeller, should the airport close. By 2007, the club's management was working on ideas to building new stadium, as the luxury boxes were all sold out and the club could not make more than NOK22 to 23 million per year on commercial income from Åråsen. In 2009, Lillestrøm launched itself as one of six candidate cities for Norway's joint bid with Sweden to host Euro 2016. This would involve building a new venue seating between 35,000 and 44,000 in Lillestrøm. The stadium would be built in modules, so the upper tiers could be dismounted after the championship and installed on other venues. The proposal was selected as one of four for the bid, but the bid was never sent. In January 2009, the club sold 25 percent of their ownership in Åråsen Eiendom, which is responsible for operating the commercial facilities at the stadium, to Lillestrømbanken, a local bank, for NOK9 million. The club retained full ownership of Åråsen Stadion AS, the company which owns the venue. In a 2012 survey carried out by the Norwegian Players' Association among away-team captains, Åråsen was found to be the league's third-best stadium, with a score of 4.33 on a scale from <b>one</b> <b>to</b> <b>five.</b>|$|E
