25|$|In {{contrast}} with Ringelmann's first findings, Bibb Latané et al. replicated previous social loafing findings while demonstrating that the decreased performance of groups was attributable to reduced individual effort, {{as distinct from}} a deterioration due to coordination. They showed this by blindfolding male college students while making them wear headphones that masked all noise. They then asked them to shout both in actual groups and pseudogroups in which they shouted alone but believed they were shouting with others. When subjects believed <b>one</b> <b>other</b> <b>person</b> was shouting, they shouted 82% as intensely as they did alone, but with five others, their effort decreased to 74%.|$|E
25|$|In some societies, people {{sleep with}} at least <b>one</b> <b>other</b> <b>person</b> (sometimes many) or with animals.

For example, a person might only sleep with the immediate family, the extended family, a spouse or romantic partner, children, children of a certain age, children of specific gender, peers of a certain gender, friends, peers of equal social rank, or with no one at all. Sleep may be an actively social time, depending on the sleep groupings, with no constraints on noise or activity.|$|E

As of October 2008, Wongsawat was unable {{to gain access to}} his offices, which were occupied by protesters from the People's Alliance for Democracy. On 2 December 2008, Thailand's Constitutional Court in a highly controversial ruling found the Peoples Power Party (PPP) guilty of electoral fraud, which led to the dissolution of the party according to the law. It was later alleged in media reports that at least one member of the judiciary had a telephone conversation with officials working for the Office of the Privy Council and <b>one</b> <b>other</b> <b>person.</b> The phone call was taped and has since circulated on the Internet. In it, the callers discuss finding a way to ensure the ruling PPP party would be disbanded.

25|$|The cunning folk of Britain {{were often}} from the {{societal}} class that included artisans, tradesmen, and farmers, {{and as such}} were commonly at least semi-literate and of a higher social position than common labourers. In many cases they continued in their ordinary line of work alongside earning money as a professional cunning man or woman {{in order to gain}} the maximum possible income. In almost all cases, cunning folk worked either alone, as a solitary magical practitioner, or with <b>one</b> <b>other</b> <b>person,</b> such as a spouse or sibling. The only known exception was in early nineteenth-century Manchester, where a group of cunning men used to meet in a group centred around the most prominent of their members, a cunning fellow called Rawlinson. This method of working alone was one factor that separated the cunning folk from the stereotype of witches then prevalent in Britain, which often held that these witches met together in groups, sometimes known as covens, and at times flew through the air {{in order to get to}} their meeting points.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} an {{experiment}} in which mothers and their child separately chose between relatively healthy foods (flasks of stewed apples) and relatively unhealthy foods (candy bars). Each participant first filled up a first bag for her/himself, and then, a second <b>one</b> for the <b>other</b> <b>person</b> of the dyad. A simple nutritional message on vitamins and sugar contents of foods was then provided, and subsequently each participant filled up a third bag for her/himself and a fourth <b>one</b> for the <b>other</b> <b>person</b> of the dyad. The results show that before revealing the nutritional message, mothers are, on average, "indulgent", {{which means that they}} choose a lower number of relatively healthy foods for their child than the one they choose for themselves. Children tend to be rather "paternalistic", which means that they choose a higher number of relatively healthy foods for their mothers than they choose for themselves. The nutritional message leads many mothers and children to significantly increase the number of relatively healthy foods selected for themselves and for the <b>other</b> <b>person.</b> The mothers' indulgence versus the children's paternalism, along with the children's reactivity to the message, suggest that mothers underestimate the children's acceptance of healthy food.
