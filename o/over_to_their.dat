5|$|Howard was {{not told}} the exact {{details of the}} {{operation}} until 2May, 1944. His orders were to seize the bridges over the River Orne and Caen Canal at Bénouville and Ranville intact and hold them until relieved. The relief force would initially be a company from the 7th Parachute Battalion under Howard's command. When {{the remainder of the}} parachute battalion arrived, he would hand <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> commander Lieutenant-Colonel Richard Pine-Coffin. The 3rd Infantry Division and the commandos of the 1st Commando Brigade were scheduled to land at Sword at 06:00 on the day then advance to the bridges where they were expected to arrive at 11:00.|$|E
5|$|Imagery {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of the Orb's persona. This is most prominent during live performances, where they often project surreal images against onstage screens. Common images include morphing faces, futuristic cityscapes, and aliens. They have long associated their act with absurd symbology with images such as floating pigs. This has carried <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins. Because of their use of psychedelic images at shows, the Orb's shows are frequently compared to those of Pink Floyd, who also used in-show imagery and films. Paterson cites Godfrey Reggio's and Philip Glass's film Koyaanisqatsi as a primary influence to their concert imagery.|$|E
5|$|In June 2015, Valve {{announced}} that the entirety of Dota 2 would be ported <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> Source 2 game engine in an update called Dota 2 Reborn, making Dota 2 the first game to use the engine. Reborn was first {{released to the public}} as a beta update that same month, and officially replaced the original client in September 2015. Reborn included a new user interface framework design, ability for custom game modes created by the community, and the full replacement of the original Source engine with Source 2. Largely attributed to technical difficulties players experienced with the update, the global player base experienced a sharp drop of approximately sixteen percent the month following the release of Reborn. However, after various updates and patches, over a million concurrent players were playing again by the beginning of 2016, with that being the largest amount of users in nearly a year. The move to Source 2 also allowed the use of the Vulkan graphics API, which was released as an optional feature in May 2016, making Dota 2 one of the first games to offer it.|$|E

5|$|After the {{televised}} draft, Joey Styles, the Director of Digital Media Content for WWE's official website, interviewed the draftees on their reactions. The drafted wrestlers generally expressed {{approval of the}} draft and described what they hoped their experiences would be with their new brand. Seven of the wrestlers were champions with their original brand, and as outlined in the draft regulations, they carried their titles <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> new brand; this affected seven of nine championships. Champion draft selections included: Unified Tag Team Champions The Colóns (Carlito and Primo), United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter, WWE Champion Triple H, and Divas Champion Maryse from SmackDown to Raw; Women's Champion Melina and Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio from Raw to SmackDown. Since Triple H was drafted to Raw, it left SmackDown without a top contested title, as Raw now featured {{two of the three}} top contested championships in WWE: the WWE and World Heavyweight Championships (although Edge would later brought the World Heavyweight Championship title back to SmackDown as its exclusive-top title following his win against John Cena at Backlash). When Mysterio and Porter switched brands, the two secondary championships switched brands {{for the first time in}} WWE's history. This also occurred when Melina and Maryse switched brands, as the two female contested titles also switched brands for the first time. Though the Unified Tag Team Champions were both drafted over to Raw from SmackDown, the titles were able to be defended on all three brands due to being unified.|$|E

25|$|The brutal {{treatment}} of Ashurnasirpal II succeeded in pacifying the rebels. While campaigning in Syria, {{he was able}} to take a large number of soldiers from Mesopotamia, without fear of a rebellion cutting off their supply lines. They were so successful in their brutality in the northern cities of Syria in that many of the smaller settlements were immediately handed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> troops, then they marched south in parallel of the Mediterranean.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February 1804, HMS Centaur sent four {{boats and}} 72 men under Lieutenant Robert Carthew Reynolds {{to cut her}} out at Fort Royal harbour, Martinique. The British {{suffered}} nine wounded, two of whom, including Reynolds, later died. The French suffered ten dead and 30 wounded, many mortally. Cordier, wounded, fell into a boat and escaped. The British sent Curieux under a flag of truce to Fort Royal to hand the wounded <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> countrymen.|$|E

25|$|Madame Montour {{was known}} to be a friend of the British. She welcomed the white men who were {{beginning}} to migrate into the West Branch Susquehanna River Valley. She also had a great amount of influence with the various Indian tribes as they were feeling the pressure of colonial expansion. Madame Montour remained loyal to the British despite several attempts by the French to bring her <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> side. Historians note that this was remarkable considering the British colonial government sometimes went as long as a year without paying her for her services.|$|E
25|$|The treaty held until Binnya U's {{death in}} 1384. Though officially viceroys, Byattaba and Laukpya ruled their territories like sovereigns. For their part, {{they did not}} get {{involved}} in the affairs of Pegu even when the king gradually withdrew from governing due to his long illness. When U's 15-year-old son Binnya Nwe raised a rebellion in 1383, neither viceroy interfered. When princess-regent Maha Dewi asked them to contribute troops to put down the rebellion, each sent a regiment to ensure that the fighting would not spill <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> territories. But neither joined the actual fighting.|$|E
25|$|The Games {{were then}} handed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> modern birthplace, Athens, which succeeded Sydney as Olympic host city. Two Greek flags were raised; one to honour {{the birthplace of}} the Olympics, and the other to honour Athens. The {{ceremony}} concluded with a huge fireworks display on Sydney Harbour. The fireworks display itself concluded with a very low flyover of Stadium Australia by an RAAF F-111C which performed a dump-and-burn manoeuvre synchronised with the extinction of the Olympic Flame. This created the appearance of the flame being carried away into the sky, flying in a northeasterly direction out across Sydney Harbour and ultimately towards Athens in a symbolic handover.|$|E

25|$|The 1890s {{and early}} 1900s {{were marked by}} {{frequent}} strikes throughout Georgia. The peasants, too, were still discontented, and the Social Democrats won peasants and urban workers <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> cause. At this stage, the Georgian Social Democrats still saw themselves {{as part of an}} all-Russian political movement. However, at the Second Congress of the all-Russian Social Democratic Party held in Belgium in 1903, the party split into two irreconcilable groups: the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks. By 1905, the Social Democratic movement in Georgia had overwhelmingly decided in favour of the Mensheviks and their leader Noe Zhordania. One of the few Georgians to opt for the Bolshevik faction was the young Ioseb Jughashvili, better known as Joseph Stalin.|$|E
25|$|When Domhnall of Lennox died in 1365, Donnchadh's mother Margaret became {{ruler of}} Lennox. It had been Domhnall's {{intention}} {{that the marriage}} would eventually allow the succession of a son, i.e. Donnchadh, but {{it is probable that}} Baltar intended to rule in his turn. It is not known how relations deteriorated, but it seems that Donnchadh got impatient. In the summer of 1384, King Robert II issued two charters formally conferring the Mormaerdom on Baltar. However, a year later he and his wife Margaret resigned the Mormaerdom <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> eldest son Donnchadh, and hence Donnchadh became ruler. However, in 1388, Baltar and Margaret were handed custody of the Mormaerdom for the remainder of their lives, with Donnchadh retaining the title. Donnchadh was confined to a stronghold in Loch Lomond, Inchmurrin castle.|$|E
25|$|A small few lucky civilians {{managed to}} escape. When the Venetians retreated <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> ships, the Ottomans {{had already taken}} {{the walls of the}} Golden Horn. Luckily for the {{occupants}} of the city, the Ottomans were not interested in killing them, but rather in the loot they could get from raiding the city's houses, so they decided to attack the city instead. The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn. Having done so, the Venetians left in ships filled with soldiers and refugees. Shortly after the Venetians left, a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor's ships followed them out of the Golden Horn. This fleet narrowly escaped prior to the Ottoman navy assuming control over the Golden Horn, which was accomplished by midday.|$|E
