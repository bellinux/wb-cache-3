Compared with the thermal <b>cracking</b> process, the <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> of this microalga displayed higher selectivity for and greater yield of these olefins. The <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> of extracted lipids and the corresponding residues of the microalga was also examined, and the results showed that the lipids could be efficiently converted to light olefins. The <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> of lipids extracted by different solvents demonstrated that neutral lipids gave the highest yield of light olefins at 36. 7 %. The yields of light olefins obtained from <b>catalytic</b> <b>cracking</b> of the extraction residues were much lower than the yields obtained from lipids, and thus the lipids, especially the neutral lipids, are the primary contributors to the generation of light olefins.
