5|$|On October 8, 2012, {{the series}} was {{announced}} as ending with issue 300, following which a new title, Constantine started at the main imprint of DC comics. By 2013, Constantine was contacted by the Three Fates, who {{tell him that he}} will finally meet his end in five days. Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn't going to try to come back to life. Then, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him corporeal again. Thinking to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} that the fleet has missed me as yet," [...] I said, but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not grasp my meaning, and only looked puzzled.|$|E
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not keep}} his great design from Dickory--it was too glorious, too transcendent. He took his young admiral into his cabin and laid before him his {{dazzling}} future.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, ma'am,' I answered, 'the master {{has no idea}} of {{your being}} deranged; and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not fear that you will let {{yourself}} die of hunger.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Who do {{you mean}} by Dickson? O, Michael Finsbury! Why, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>does!</b> <b>He</b> lost it too. If he had it, he'd have won the tontine to-morrow." ...|$|R
25|$|I don't want {{to answer}} the question, because <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>does...</b> Ash in Alien {{had nothing to do}} with Roy Batty, because Roy Batty is more humanoid, whereas Ash was more metal.|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not believe}} this. That {{her body was}} a cast-off garment was easy to comprehend, but that her spirit hovered near and would {{re-enter}} its former habitation was incredible.|$|E
60|$|To do this he {{struggled}} desperately, {{regardless of the}} pain; but the bonds remained firm until Gus returned, when, as a matter <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not dare to make any further movement.|$|E
60|$|No {{less than}} three times were these words repeated, I reading them from the motion of his lips, for as a matter <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not dare to speak so loud that I could hear him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have spoken}} to him about it. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not like leaving you, {{but he says that}} he should like it a {{thousand}} times better than, perhaps, having to go into some humdrum office in England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It must do, {{since we}} can do no better; but he has his trunk curled up and tucked into his mouth. That is unfortunate, and is {{calculated}} to mislead, for <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not usually have it in that position." [...] He touched his bell.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, but <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> I'm {{the heir}} to the place instead of you. It is natural that he should dislike me. But I'll live it down. You see if I don't. I'll make him so fond of me, he'll always want to have me here. I don't mind a little dislike to begin with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{he knows}} that it is I who insist upon marrying you! I {{explained}} it all to him--how I had asked you. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not understand. He thinks, I suppose, that it is simply an infatuation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anything {{you like}} to ask and that I can give," [...] she {{answered}} {{in a tone of}} earnestness which struck him as peculiar, for <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not know the news that she had just heard from Mr. Quest.|$|E
60|$|MRS. HIGGINS. Well, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> What right {{have you}} to go to the police and give the girl's name {{as if she were a}} thief, or a lost umbrella, or something? Really! [She sits down again, deeply vexed].|$|E
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> I, <b>of</b> all men, am {{not going}} to deny that. But {{remember}} that there never has been an artistic age, or an artistic people, {{since the beginning of the}} world. The artist has always been, and will always be, an exquisite exception. There is no golden age of art; only artists who have produced what is more golden than gold.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{what is the}} trick? You said {{he shook}} hands with his jailers and walked off. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> couldn't <b>do</b> that, unless his time was up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{show the}} list to Gresham to-morrow," [...] said Ratler, [...] "and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> can <b>do</b> as <b>he</b> pleases; but I don't {{understand}} this kind of thing." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not see her. Flame-lit and unseeing! Always the same, {{with his}} meeting eyebrows, his common cap, and his red-and-black scarf knotted round his throat. Not even a collar to meet her! The flames had sunk, there was shadow.|$|E
60|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not. And {{he might}} have known well enough that the negro could not {{understand}} him. But he deemed it wiser to make a reply of some kind, however unintelligible, than to stand like a post and say nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did it on purpose? What; {{make up to}} Miss Madeline? Why, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it on purpose. He's been a-thinking of it {{ever since}} Christmas night, when I saw you, Master Augustus, and a certain young lady when you came out into the dark passage together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want you}} to think that you have {{occasion}} to speak ill of me, either one way or the other. What I mean is this--I don't quite think that the evidence against Nokes is strong enough to justify me in sending him away; but I'll {{keep an eye on him}} as well as I can. It seems that he left our place early this morning; but the men are not supposed to be there on Sundays, and <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> as <b>he</b> pleases with himself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I thank you, no. I merely {{called to}} inquire outside whether my dilatory friend {{had been so}} false to himself as to be {{practical}} and sensible. But, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> has <b>done</b> nothing. I gave him your papers with my own hand, and he was hot upon the intention, but <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> has <b>done</b> nothing. Apart from the general human disinclination {{to do anything that}} ought to be done, I dare say there is a specially about assuring one's life. You find it like will-making. People are so superstitious, and take it for granted they will die soon afterwards.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; <b>of</b> <b>course.</b> Whatever <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> <b>he</b> {{will never}} forget the {{interests}} of science. He is true to his lady-love, to whomever else he plays false. That is his saving virtue." ...|$|R
60|$|The scout smiled, {{not because}} of what was said, which <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not understand, {{but because of the}} Englishman's expression. But time pressed; too much had already been lost. He {{therefore}} contented himself by giving Lancey a friendly slap on the shoulder and turned to the sergeant.|$|E
60|$|He heard and, {{although}} <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not believe}} that I had lost the spoor on purpose, stared at me till I thought his little eyes were going {{to drop out of}} his head. But even in his admiration he contrived to convey an insult as only a native can.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> mind, and {{of course}} he said he didn't. He artfully skirted the field of {{conversation}} by very West Sixteenth Street observations on a town through which they passed, while she merely smiled wearily, and at best remarked [...] "Yes, that's so," [...] whether it was so or not.|$|E
2500|$|Some adverbs may {{be formed}} {{with the basic}} form instead of the t-form, {{especially}} those ending in -ig, -lig and -vis: det forstår han selvfølgelig ikke, [...] "that, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not understand"; the t-less form of such adverbs is obligatory when the adverb is isolated (i.e. with no corresponding adjective) or {{the meaning of the}} adverb is essentially {{different from that of the}} adjective (e.g. endelig, [...] "finally, at last" [...] ~ endeligt, [...] "definitively"). In other cases, the t-less form is preferred when the adverb qualifies an adjective (e.g. væsentlig(t) større, considerably larger").|$|R
6000|$|... "That's mere holiday work," [...] {{said the}} barrister's anxious wife. [...] "There's nothing he likes {{so much as}} that; {{but it is the}} reading of those horrible long papers by gaslight. I wouldn't mind how much he had to talk, nor yet how much he had to write, if it wasn't for all that weary reading. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> have juniors with him now, but I don't find that it makes much difference. He's at it every night, sheet after sheet; and though he always says he's coming up immediately, it's two or three before he's in bed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Harry is sowing a {{very big}} crop this year, {{and most of it}} on fall back-set," [...] she said. [...] "He has, however, horses enough to do that kind of thing, and, <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> it thoroughly." [...] Then she glanced towards where the teams were hauling unusually heavy ploughs through the grassy sod. [...] "This is virgin prairie that he's breaking, and he'll {{probably}} put oats on it. They ripen quicker. He ought to be a rich man after harvest unless the frost comes, or the market goes against him. Some of his neighbours, including my husband, would have sown a little less and held a reserve in hand." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{leave my}} window open," [...] he complained to Mr. Direck. [...] "Often I have askit them not to. And <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not understand. He has out climbit by the ivy. Anything may have {{happened}} to him. Anything. He is not used to going out alone. He is too young.|$|E
6000|$|... "White lord, {{the king}} {{says that a}} bargain is a bargain, and he will keep to his word. Only you must not then blame him if the {{shooting}} is bad, since <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not know that the}} night would be so cloudy, which is not usual at this time of year." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a Frenchman in the room, {{but as he}} had {{not been}} above ten years in London, <b>of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not speak the language, and lost the benefit of the conversation. 'But, O my country!' said I to myself, it's no wonder that you are so beloved! If I were a Frenchman, how I would hate you!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is a cheat {{because he}} wants things for less than their value; and a dupe because, as a matter <b>of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not get what he wants. I made no bargain at Liverpool,--at least, no cheap bargain; but I have made {{arrangements}} for a sufficient supply of a first-rate unadulterated article at its proper market price, and I do not fear but {{the results will be}} remunerative." [...] And then, as they went home in the railway carriage the mother talked to her son about his farming as though she had forgotten her other trouble, and she explained to him how he was to dine with Sir Peregrine.|$|R
6000|$|... "But you are engaged. He {{would never}} be so base a man as to take your word at such a moment as this. <b>Of</b> <b>course</b> <b>he</b> couldn't <b>do</b> it. If you had had small-pox, or {{anything}} horrible like that, {{he would not have}} been justified." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I was in London a twelvemonth past," [...] Corliss meditated. [...] "But I have {{undergone}} a new incarnation. London? There is no London now. It is impossible. How {{could there be}} {{so many people in}} the world? This is the world, and we know of fact that there are very few people in it, else there could not be so much ice and sea and sky. Tommy, here, I know, thinks fondly of a place he calls Toronto. He mistakes. It exists only in his mind,--a memory of a former life <b>he</b> knew. <b>Of</b> <b>course,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not think so. That is but natural; for he is no philosopher, nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> bother--" ...|$|R
