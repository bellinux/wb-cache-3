This is a tilted crustal block, about 200km across, that rises to a maximum elevation of 2km above the mare in the southeastern section. Aristarchus is just to the east of the crater Herodotus and the Vallis Schröteri, and south <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of narrow sinuous rilles named Rimae Aristarchus.|$|E
5|$|Current definition: The mole is {{the amount}} of {{substance}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of carbon-12.

5|$|For {{a general}} system, states are {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, {{the effects of a}} single measurement can influence other parts <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> {{in a manner that is}} described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the general theory is considerably more complicated than the idealization for pure states.|$|E

Filesystem snapshots allow an image of a UFS filesystem at an instant in time to be efficiently created. Snapshots allow reliable backup of a live filesystem. GEOM is a modular framework that provides RAID (levels 0, 1, 3 currently), full disk encryption, journaling, concatenation, caching, and access to network-backed storage. GEOM allows building of complex storage solutions combining ("chaining") these mechanisms.|$|E

5|$|Many {{cultures}} have attached importance to astronomical events, and the Indians, Chinese, and Maya developed elaborate systems for predicting terrestrial events from celestial observations.

40|$|AbstractOur {{research}} {{purpose is}} to realize <b>a</b> consciousness <b>system</b> on computers. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} relation between <b>a</b> primary <b>system</b> that directly interacts and learns the input-output relation within an environment, and <b>a</b> secondary <b>system</b> that continuously monitors and is able to direct the primary system. We hold that consciousness is not composed <b>of</b> <b>a</b> primary <b>system</b> alone, but that the employment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> secondary <b>system</b> is essential. The {{purpose of this paper is}} therefore to clarify the importance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> secondary <b>system.</b> We show by numerical experiments that the addition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> secondary <b>system</b> provides adaptability to <b>a</b> wider range <b>of</b> environmental changes than <b>a</b> primary <b>system</b> alone. Alternatively, we present an extraordinary case where <b>a</b> customized primary <b>system</b> fully adapts to an environment undergoing <b>a</b> particular type <b>of</b> change. Far from refuting the value <b>of</b> <b>a</b> secondary <b>system,</b> this special case serves to point out the importance of the effective design <b>of</b> <b>a</b> secondary <b>system.</b> Therefore, we confirm the value and usefulness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> secondary <b>system</b> in <b>a</b> machine consciousness <b>system</b> through these numericalexperiments...|$|R

5|$|Depending on modality, {{language}} structure can {{be based}} on systems of sounds (speech), gestures (sign languages), or graphic or tactile symbols (writing). The ways in which languages use sounds or signs to construct meaning are studied in phonology. The study of how humans produce and perceive vocal sounds is called phonetics. In spoken language, meaning is produced when sounds become part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> in which some sounds can contribute to expressing meaning and others do not. In any given language, {{only a limited number}} of the many distinct sounds that can be created by the human vocal apparatus contribute to constructing meaning.|$|E
5|$|Kinetic models {{describe}} the particle velocity distribution function at each {{point in the}} plasma and therefore {{do not need to}} assume a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. A kinetic description is often necessary for collisionless plasmas. There are two common approaches to kinetic description of a plasma. One is based on representing the smoothed distribution function on a grid in velocity and position. The other, known as the particle-in-cell (PIC) technique, includes kinetic information by following the trajectories {{of a large number of}} individual particles. Kinetic models are generally more computationally intensive than fluid models. The Vlasov equation may be used to {{describe the}} dynamics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of charged particles interacting with an electromagnetic field.|$|E

5|$|The arch {{was built}} {{as part of}} the Temple Mount's massive western {{retaining}} wall, which forms its eastern support.

There have been some theories which speculate that the dentils were employed as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> used to shore up timber forms used during construction. However, this was a common decorative element employed in the region at the time, and archaeologists have noted that in this region of limited forests it is much more likely that packed earth, rather than expensive timbers, was used to support the form on which the arch was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The {{field of}} ergodic theory {{is the study}} of the {{long-term}} behavior of chaotic dynamical systems. The protypical case of a field that ergodic theory applies to is thermodynamics, in which—though the microscopic state <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> is extremely complicated (it is impossible to understand the ensemble of individual collisions between particles of matter)—the average behavior over sufficiently long time intervals is tractable. The laws of thermodynamics are assertions about such average behavior. In particular, one formulation of the zeroth law of thermodynamics asserts that over sufficiently long timescales, the only functionally independent measurement that one can make of a thermodynamic system in equilibrium is its total energy, in the form of temperature.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} about why the hoard was buried. One is that the hoard represented a deliberate attempt to keep wealth safe, perhaps in response to one of the many upheavals facing Roman Britain in the early fifth century. This is not the only hypothesis, however. Archaeologist Peter Guest argues that the hoard was buried because the items in it were used as part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of gift-exchange, and as Britain separated from the Roman Empire, they were no longer required. A third hypothesis is that the Hoxne Hoard represents the proceeds of a robbery, buried to avoid detection.|$|E
