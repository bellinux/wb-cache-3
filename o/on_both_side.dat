5|$|Sose {{made its}} closest {{approach}} to New Caledonia early on April 8, passing about 280 km (175 mi) to the northeast. A strong area of high pressure over New Zealand served to tighten to surface pressure gradient {{well to the}} south of Sose's center, contributing to an overall very large envelope of gale-force winds. In turn, the cyclone affected numerous islands <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>side</b> of its path, despite never having made landfall. As it progressed on its southeastward track, the cyclone began to show signs of weakening, at least partially due to increasing wind shear from an approaching upper trough. At the same time, a mid-level ridge to the east forced the storm to turn due south; the conflicting wind patterns undermined the cyclone's circulation, causing its center at the surface to separate from the deep convection. Both the FMS and the JTWC reflected steady weakening, and by early on April 10, the center had become exposed and ill-defined. Sose then entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand, where it continued to deteriorate. The JTWC issued its last warning on 19P at 0600 UTC on April 11, while the system was located about 335km (210mi) northeast of Norfolk Island. TCWC Wellington soon downgraded Sose to a tropical depression as it underwent an extratropical transition. Drifting south-southwestward, the cyclone lost its tropical identity early on April 12. The remnant low ultimately moved over the Tasman Sea, where it was absorbed by a broad low pressure system about to travel over New Zealand's North Island. Abundant residual tropical moisture acted on the low pressure environment to create widespread precipitation across northern New Zealand.|$|E

In 1927, platform extensions were built at DeKalb Avenue in order to allow for longer trains. The extensions were built into a curve south of the station–they were closed in 1960 when they were replaced by straight extensions to the north. DeKalb Avenue received a new mezzanine with escalators {{at the north end of}} the station.

25|$|After the NBA had {{awarded a}} {{franchise}} to the Phoenix metropolitan area in 1968, local designers chose purple and orange {{as the main}} colors for the Phoenix Suns' uniforms. The decoration of the uniforms (numbers, names and logos <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>side</b> of the jerseys) were accent with orange while the purple {{was used as a}} color so as to emphasize the stripes and the decorations of it, which lent a crisp, dark accent color to complement the orange just inside. Since their debut, the Suns home uniforms have been always white coloured with purple and orange trim. When playing abroad, their uniforms are normally purple with white and orange trim, with accents of black during the 1990s and gray on the current versions. They also had a black alternate uniform from 1994–2000.|$|E

Its entrance is a single door with round-arched window above and on the sides. Its lowest stage is a three-story masonry tower with wooden cornices separating the stories, topped by three frame ones above a curved cornice. The lower two are octagonal, one featuring a clock and the next louvered round-arched vents. The uppermost stage, the conical steeple, has ribs defining its eight facts and is covered with diamond-shaped wooden shingles.

25|$|The {{blue runner}} is a fast-swimming {{predator}} which primarily takes small benthic fishes as prey in inshore waters. Studies on the species diet <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>side</b> of the Atlantic have shown similar results. A Puerto Rican study found the species supplements its fish dominated diet with crabs, shrimps, copepods {{and other small}} crustaceans. More detailed research in Cape Verde found as well as fish, blue runner take shrimp, prawns, lobsters, jellyfish and other small invertebrates. The diet of juveniles is more zooplankton dominated, with young fish predominantly taking cyclopoid and calanoid copepods, and gradually moving to a more fish based diet. Adult blue runner living offshore or aggregating around oil and gas platforms tend to have less fish in their diet, foraging extensively on larger zooplankton during the summer months, with larval decapods and stomatopods, hyperiid amphipods, pteropods, and larval and juvenile fishes also taken.|$|E
25|$|Chevrolet's {{design for}} the year fared better than its other GM offerings, and lacked the overabundance of chrome found on Pontiacs, Oldsmobiles, Buicks and Cadillacs. Complementing Chevrolet's front design was a broad grille and quad {{headlights}} that helped simulate a 'Baby Cadillac'; the tail received a fan-shaped alcove <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>side</b> panels, which housed dual tail lights. Despite being a recession year, consumers made Chevrolet the No. 1 make of automobile (beating Ford, which held the title in 1957) and the Bel Air was {{at the core of}} Chevrolet's popularity. With its wide variety of body styles and models, Bel Airs could be optioned with almost every conceivable luxury within the Chevrolet line. The Nomad station wagon name also reappeared in 1958 when the vehicle bowed as the premium four-door Chevrolet station wagon, lacking the unique styling of the 1955-57 Nomads. Most Chevrolet station wagon models had two tail lights (one {{on each side of the}} body) housed in abbreviated alcoves, which were made smaller to accommodate the rear gate. A new dash was used.|$|E

2500|$|In 1619, the Virginia Company of London {{under a new}} leader, Sir Edwin Sandys, {{instituted a}} number of changes, to help stimulate more {{investment}} and attract settlers from England. In the long view, foremost among these was the establishment of what became the House of Burgesses, the first representative legislative body in the European settlement of North America, predecessor of today's Virginia General Assembly, first convened by a Royal Governor, Sir George Yeardley, of Flowerdew Hundred Plantation. Also in 1619, the plantations and developed portions of the Colony were divided into four [...] "incorporations" [...] or [...] "citties," [...] as they were then called. These were (east to west) Elizabeth Cittie (initially known as Kecoughtan), James Cittie, Charles Cittie, and Henrico Cittie. Each cittie covered a very large area.

The entire middle section is built about half a meter higher than the front section and back section, the difference in elevation is clearly visible from the outside of the house. One of the bedrooms functions as a ceremonial nuptial chamber, where daughters and their husbands will reside during the first years of their marriage. One can see the middle section as the most important part of the house, in relation to the lower sections of the male front section and the female rear section, a place for a bedroom where procreation may takes place.|$|E
2500|$|The Battle of Copenhagen 1801 (...) was {{the first}} of two battles which saw the British fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Hyde Parker and Horatio Nelson, a vice admiral in 1801, fight a huge Danish fleet {{anchored}} just off Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. The Danish fleet at the inlet of the Copenhagen harbour formed a blockade preventing the British fleet from entering the harbour. The Danish mainly used older ships not meant to sail in the sea as blockades. Denmark defended the capital with these ships and bastions <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>side</b> of the harbour inlet, Kastellet, Trekroner, Lynetten (which all still exists) as well as Quintus, Sixtus and Strickers. It was the second attempt by the British to scare Denmark, as the British had already entered Øresund with a navy in August 1800, in order to force Denmark to sign an alliance with Britain. Now Britain would have Denmark's entire navy and merchant fleet, so it would not {{fall into the hands of}} the French. The British were not aware that the modern Royal Danish Navy and many merchant ships were well hidden in the Roskilde fjord, a bluff which was never called by the British.|$|E

2500|$|One {{result of}} the {{narrowing}} of the East River along the shoreline of Manhattan and, later, Brooklyn [...] which continued until the mid-19th century when the state {{put a stop to}} it [...] was an increase in the speed of its current. Buttermilk Channel, the strait that divides Governors Island from Red Hook in Brooklyn, and which is located directly south of the [...] "mouth" [...] of the East River, was in the early 17th century a fordable waterway across which cattle could be driven. [...] Further investigation by Colonel Jonathan Williams determined that the channel was by 1776 three fathoms deep (...) , five fathoms deep (...) in the same spot by 1798, and when surveyed by Williams in 1807 had deepened to 7 fathoms (...) at low tide. [...] What had been almost a bridge between two landforms which were once connected had become a fully navigable channel, thanks to the constriction of the East River and the increased flow it caused. Soon, the current in the East River had become so strong that larger ships had to use auxiliary steam power in order to turn. [...] The continued narrowing of the channel <b>on</b> <b>both</b> <b>side</b> may have been the reasoning behind the suggestion of one New York State Senator, who wanted to fill in the East River and annex Brooklyn, with the cost of doing so being covered byselling the newly made land. [...] Others proposed a dam at Roosevelt Island (then Blackwell's Island) to create a wet basin for shipping.|$|E
