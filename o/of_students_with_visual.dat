The CI (Cognitive Impaired) major qualifies {{one for a}} recommendation to the Michigan Department of Education for k-12 endorsement as a Teacher of Students with Cognitive Impairment. This particular program requires 151 hours worth of credits, which includes general education credit requirements from the University. The EI (Emotional Impairment) also qualifies one for a recommendation to the Michigan department of Education for k-12 endorsement as a Teacher of Students with Emotional Impairments. This program requires 136 hours worth of credits. HI, the Hearing Impairment program, qualifies one for a recommendation to the Michigan department of Education for k-12 endorsement as a Teacher of Students with Hearing Impairment. Eastern Michigan has been an approved center for training teachers of the hearing impaired since 1967. VI, the Visual Impairment program, qualifies one for a recommendation to the Michigan department of Education for k-12 endorsement as a Teacher <b>of</b> <b>Students</b> <b>with</b> <b>Visual</b> Impairment.

A sample of 132 teachers who had been trained at either the undergraduate or graduate level and were employed within their first five years as teachers with this specialization completed the Holland Self-Directed Search (Form CP) and a Participant Profile form to ascertain the personality types and experiences of those new to the field. The study considered three variables: (1) gender, (2) race/ethnicity, (3) teacher training level and their association with Holland personality type (RIASEC).

40|$|Introduction: This study {{examined}} the everyday work of eight teachers <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments at governmental primary and secondary schools in Queensland, Australia. The small-scale study aimed to capture the scope {{and complexity of the}} activities of these teachers and the regular challenges they face in their expected everyday roles. Methods: Telephone interviews were used to collect descriptive data from the teachers. A direct field-sampling procedure was used across the governmental schools to recruit qualified and specialist teachers who met prespecified criteria, most of whom lived in Brisbane, Queensland's capital city. The content of the interviews was generated from two sequenced activities with a different group of experienced teachers <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments. Results: The teachers carried out complex and demanding duties as part of their everyday roles. These duties were consistent with those performed by their counterparts around the world. The most frequently performed and most important activities including providing direct support to students, advocating for students' needs, and collaborating across school and community contexts. The identified challenges were linked primarily to the lack of time to undertake important activities. Discussion: Three important and interconnected findings can be drawn from the results: role complexity, time and collaboration, and the importance of the expanded core curriculum. Implications for Practitioners: The findings provide an initial snapshot of the changing role reported by the teachers. Thus, these data offer a beginning point for future probes into the workplace knowledge and skills required by teachers <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairments.

A problem exists with reduced support and training for regular {{education teachers}} responsible for meeting literacy needs <b>of</b> <b>students</b> <b>with</b> <b>visual</b> impairment. The purpose of this qualitative interpretive case {{study was to explore}} regular education instructors 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of their self-efficacy and ability to modify literature for learners with visual impairment. The research questions targeted this purpose, specifically in the areas of training opportunities and technology use. The social cognitive theory, a model emphasizing learning occurring through social contexts and observations, was used as the conceptual framework for this study. Data were collected from 1 -on- 1 interviews with 10 volunteer regular education teachers teaching students at the elementary level. The resulting data were analyzed via color-coding transcripts, NVivo running word-frequency queries, and manual review of each transcript.
