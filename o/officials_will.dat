5|$|Leslie (Amy Poehler) and the Pawnee parks {{department}} {{prepares for}} a visit by park department officials from Boraqua, Pawnee's Sister City in Venezuela. Leslie warns her co-workers the Venezuelan government <b>officials</b> <b>will</b> likely be poor, simple people. Later, the Venezuelan delegation arrives, headed by their parks department vice director Raul Alejandro Bastilla Pedro de Veloso de Morana, the Vice-director Ejecutivo del Diputado del Departmento de Parques, L.G.V. (Fred Armisen), Antonio, Jhonny and Elvis. There are cultural clashes right away, like when they mistake Tom (Aziz Ansari) for a servant and order him to get their bags. They also mistakenly believe they can choose any woman to have sex with; they all favor Donna (Retta). Raul and Leslie exchange gifts during a meet-and-greet party, where Raul and the Venezuelans act condescending toward the Pawnee residents, making offensive remarks about the town and mocking the gifts Leslie gives them. They continue to give orders to Tom, who follows along because they give him large cash tips.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{before the}} start of the season, the IPL {{governing}} council ruled that Sri Lankan cricketers and match <b>officials</b> <b>will</b> not participate in any matches held in Chennai. This was a result of the growing political tensions in Tamil Nadu concerning the ethnic conflict between the Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamils. The anti-Sinhalaese sentiments from the people of Tamil Nadu raised security concerns for Sri Lankan involvement. The decision was made after Jayalalithaa, the chief minister of Tamil Nadu, wrote to the Prime Minister of India requesting the ban.|$|E
25|$|From 1 January 2010, {{the wearing}} of helmets with faceguards became {{compulsory}} for hurlers at all levels. This saw senior players follow the regulations already introduced in 2009 at minor and under 21 grades. The GAA hopes to significantly {{reduce the number of}} injuries by introducing the compulsory wearing of helmets with full faceguards, both in training and matches. Hurlers of all ages, including those at nursery clubs when holding a hurley in their hand, must wear a helmet and faceguard at all times. Match <b>officials</b> <b>will</b> be obliged to stop play if any player at any level appears on the field of play without the necessary standard of equipment.|$|E

5|$|The tape at {{the start}} line was made more sturdy, {{consisting}} of three strands instead of one, and in a more distinctive pattern; {{the width of the}} start was also reduced.

500|$|Mike Stoops, the Arizona {{head coach}} and brother to Oklahoma head coach Bob Stoops, said he felt it [...] "was ridiculous that they couldn't {{get all of the}} angles.

500|$|Every adult {{woman has}} to have a close male {{relative}} as her [...] "guardian". As a result, Human Rights Watch has described the position of Saudi women as no different from being a minor, with little authority over their own lives. The guardian is entitled to make a number of critical decisions on a woman's behalf. These include giving approval for the woman to travel, to hold some types of business licenses, to study at a university or college and to work if the type of business is not [...] "deemed appropriate for a woman." [...] Even where a guardian’s approval is not legally required, some <b>officials</b> <b>will</b> still ask for it. Women also face discrimination in the courts, where the testimony of one man equals that of two women, and in family and inheritance law (see above).|$|E

A delayed penalty {{is one in which}} the a penalty is called but play is not yet stopped because the opposing team retains the puck.

5000|$|In [...] "three-person" [...] mechanics, {{the court}} is further divided among three {{official}}s, with the lead (baseline) official determining {{the position of the}} other two officials. Normally, the lead <b>official</b> <b>will</b> move {{to the side of the}} court in which the ball is located (strong side), particularly if there is a [...] "post-up" [...] player in that position. The official that is on the same sideline as the lead official then takes up a position approximately level with the top of the three-point line and becomes the [...] "trail" [...] official, while the third <b>official</b> <b>will</b> stand across the court near the free throw line in what is called the center position. This creates a triangle coverage of the court. Often, the lead will switch sides of the baseline during a play, requiring the trail to move down to be level with the free-throw line and become the new center, while the center will move up and become the trail. As the ball moves to the other end of the court in transition, the lead will become the trail, the trail will become the lead, and the center <b>official</b> <b>will</b> remain in the centre (unless the new [...] "lead" [...] moves across the baseline to cover the strong side, in which case the center official and trail would then switch positions.) ...|$|R
