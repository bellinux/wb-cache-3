5|$|In Europe, the {{practice}} was most prevalent from the medieval era until the outbreak of World War I, but evidence of intermarriage between royal dynasties {{in other parts of}} the world can be found as far back as the Late Bronze Age. Monarchs were often in pursuit of national and international aggrandisement on behalf <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> dynasties, thus bonds of kinship tended to promote or restrain aggression. Marriage between dynasties could serve to initiate, reinforce or guarantee peace between nations. Alternatively, kinship by marriage could secure an alliance between two dynasties which sought to reduce the sense of threat from or to initiate aggression against the realm of a third dynasty. It could also enhance the prospect of territorial acquisition for a dynasty by procuring legal claim to a foreign throne, or portions of its realm (e.g., colonies), through inheritance from an heiress whenever a monarch failed to leave an undisputed male heir.|$|E
5|$|Since our blessed Lord, {{instead of}} a rich and honourable station in this world, was pleased to choose his lot among men of the lower condition; let not those, on whom the bounty of Providence hath {{bestowed}} wealth and honours, despise the men who are placed in a humble and inferior station; but rather, with their utmost power, by their countenance, by their protection, by just payment of their honest labour, encourage their daily endeavours for the support <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families. On the other hand, let the poor labour to provide things honest {{in the sight of}} all men; and so, with diligence in their several employments, live soberly, righteously, and godlily in this present world, that they may obtain that glorious reward promised in the Gospel to the poor, I mean the kingdom of Heaven.|$|E

Whether it is jealousy, feeling of incompetence that leads to resentment, or anger they all can take on both forms of emotions and help to drive the emotional reactions towards infidelity. The affective states of partners determine how they react to secrets or feelings they have not learned to expect from one another which later transforms into cognitive responses as the significant others begin to anticipate the actions and feelings <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> partners.|$|E

25|$|Gordon {{believed}} {{this approach was}} militarily counterproductive, as it encouraged the Taipings {{to fight to the}} death, which Gordon felt to be very unwise as the Taiping leader Hong Xiuquan had become murderously paranoid, conducting bloody purges of his followers. Many Taipings were only willing to surrender if the Imperial government would spare the lives <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> families. Even more importantly, Gordon had given his word of honour that all of the Taipings who surrendered would be well treated, and regarded the massacre as a stain on his honour.|$|E

Additionally, school feeding directly addresses the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) of reducing hunger by one-half, achieving universal primary education, and achieving gender parity in education by 2015.|$|E
25|$|Like Harrington, other reviewers {{recognize}} that Spybuck possessed a remarkable talent, but it often served a practical {{purpose in the}} domain of ethnography. His paintings served as illustrations for numerous anthropological writings. Dobkins calls this practice autoethnography, in which the artist or writer assimilates the techniques of ethnographers to create representations <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> cultures, with the implication of an asymmetrical power relationship between the ethnographer patron and the Native artist. Along with Spybuck, Dobkins names Jesse Cornplanter (Seneca), Peter Pitseolak (Inuit), and Frank Day (Maidu) as artists who practiced autoethnography to regain control over representations of their cultures and to retrieve and preserve their traditions. Other reviewers recognize Spybuck as an Indian artist who is a recorder and preserver of traditional practices in the midst of social change.|$|E

500|$|Lee's works {{often include}} {{elements}} of sexuality in their characterizations. She {{writes that the}} main characters of My Niagara and Subrosa reach a greater understanding <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> relationships after sexual encounters. She considers sex as [...] "never the culmination or end point", but a signifier for intimacy. As such, she feels that the more intimate aspects of sex are best conveyed wordlessly, through how it is presented, although she concedes that [...] "talky sex" [...] can be appropriate for romantic comedies.|$|E
500|$|As {{a general}} {{principle}} of the law, criminal liability is normally only imposed upon [...] "a blameworthy actor who causes a prohibited harm", and while those who attempt crimes may be blameworthy, {{it can be argued}} that there is no harm caused; attempted burglary, for example, does not lead to anything being stolen. Many theorists who make the distinction between successful and failed attempts do still consider the defendant partially liable, for example advocating a lesser punishment. However, there have been two distinct counterarguments advanced against making such a distinction. The first is that when a crime is attempted, there is a harm, namely a threat to security. Individuals have the right to security, both <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> property, and an attempt to commit a crime infringes on this right. The second is that, regardless of the harm principle, criminal liability for attempts can be justified in utilitarian terms. A person who tries to commit a crime has shown themselves to be dangerous, and must be restrained and rehabilitated to provide a deterrence for them and for others. Although a differing approach is taken in some United States jurisdictions, intervention can happen very early in a conspiracy and the defendants can still be held liable. The earlier the liability, the more controversial.|$|E
500|$|Historians {{exhibited}} varying {{responses to}} Blassingame's use of psychological theory. In a {{review in the}} William and Mary Quarterly, George Mullin is especially critical of Blassingame's use of psychology, stating that Blassingame [...] "reduc slave behavior and culture {{to a question of}} roles and psychological characteristics". He concludes that an [...] "E. P. Thompson for the American Black community during slavery is still off-stage", and that the topic needs exploration by a social or economic historian. Rawick states that Blassingame's [...] "first major error lies in adopting the very questionable deterministic social psychological role theories associated with ... Irving Goffman and Henry Stack Sullivan." [...] He complains that it [...] "parodies the basic complexity of the 'psychology' of the oppressed who simultaneously view themselves in socially negative terms while struggling against the view <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> behavior". Rawick is convinced that Blassingame would have reached the same conclusions from the sources without the use of psychology [...] "because the historical evidence as seen through an unadulterated commitment to the struggles of the slaves and an equally uncompromising hostility to the masters would have led him there." [...] On the other hand, Eugene D. Genovese and Earl E. Thorpe praised Blassingame for his use of psychological theory, but admit they prefer Freudian and Marxist interpretations over Sullivanian theory.|$|E

500|$|After a {{game against}} Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road in September 2010, manager Kenny Jackett said Millwall's {{hooligan}} problems are {{to a certain extent}} exaggerated by media sensationalism. [...] "I see it as unjust. We are an easy club to criticise and in my time , the way we have been reported is unfair", he said. Other examples of this include archive footage of their hooligan element's past bad behaviour being shown, when disorder has occurred at other grounds, not involving them. During a game between Millwall and Huddersfield Town, The Observer reported that a Huddersfield Town fan had thrown a coin at a linesman, and that some Millwall fans had intervened, and handed the culprit over to police. The News of the World, however, bore the headline: [...] "Millwall Thugs Deck Linesman With Concrete". This has led to a siege mentality among supporters of the club, which gave rise to the Millwall fans' famous terrace chant, No one likes us, we don't care, being sung in defiant defence <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> team. In April 2013, Millwall met Wigan Athletic in a semi-final of the FA Cup. Millwall lost the game 2–0. Towards the end of the match, violence broke out in part of the stand allocated to Millwall, with individuals fighting amongst themselves and then against police, resulting in 14 arrests, of which two were Wigan supporters. In January 2014, a Millwall fan ripped a linesman's flag after a corner was not given to his side during {{a game against}} Leicester City; Millwall lost 1–3.|$|E
500|$|While most child {{characters}} {{on the show}} are foul-mouthed, Kenny is often even more risqué with his dialogue. Parker and Stone state that they depict Kenny and his friends in this manner in order to display how young boys really talk when they are alone. While Kenny is often cynical and profane, Parker notes that there nonetheless is an [...] "underlying sweetness" [...] aspect to the character, and Time magazine described Kenny and his friends as [...] "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence". He is amused by toilet humor and bodily functions, and his favorite television personalities are Terrance and Phillip, a Canadian duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes. Kenny is shown to desire intercourse in the episode [...] "The Ring", when Kenny gets a girlfriend and is overjoyed {{to find out that}} she has a reputation as a slut. Kenny is also lecherous, and often portrayed as being eager to do and say disgusting things in an attempt to impress others or earn money. Conversely, his alter-ego Mysterion is seemingly mature, principled, and serious-minded, the only exception being one instance in [...] "Mysterion Rises" [...] in which he takes delight in irritating Cartman. As Mysterion he convinces his parents to take better care <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> children, as seen by their reaction when he questions them about the cult of Cthulhu. He also uses his disguise to protect his sister Karen (who refers to Mysterion as her [...] "guardian angel"), as revealed in [...] "The Poor Kid." [...] In all of his guises, however, Kenny is depicted as being uncommonly selfless, dying for the sake of others and spending all of his time working so he could buy his little sister a doll.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{researchers}} {{maintain that}} people only engage in survival sex {{when they have}} no other options. Psychologist and anti-prostitution activist Melissa Farley, writing in the New York Times, says that prostitution is nearly always coercive and lacking in full consent.

Farley says women rarely have viable alternative means of paying for the basic needs <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> loved ones. Farley argues that even having the [...] "job option" [...] is immoral because it will most likely hurt women who are very vulnerable (psychologically, economically, or otherwise). Farley says for women looking to survive, the experience can be traumatizing, and she describes it as [...] "Becoming objects for masturbation". She also warns that the men who pay for prostitution the most are usually the most violent towards women.|$|E
2500|$|At most times, Rome's {{thoroughfares}} {{would have}} been with crowded with citizens and non-citizens jostling about their business, in {{a great variety of}} colourful garments, with few togas in evidence. Only a higher-caste Roman, a magistrate, would have had lictors to clear his way, and even then, wearing a toga was hard work. Its apparent natural simplicity and [...] "elegant, flowing lines" [...] were the result of diligent practice and cultivation; its wearer must walk with measured, stately gait, or risk an embarrassing disarrangement. In this respect, Wilson (1924), after experiment with various fabrics, found the rough texture of the woolen toga a practical necessity; smoother fabrics refused to stay in their proper place. Vout (1966) suggests that the toga's most challenging qualities as garment fitted the Romans' view <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> civilization. Like the empire itself, the peace that the toga came to represent had been earned through the extraordinary and unremitting collective efforts of its citizens, who could therefore claim [...] "the time and dignity to dress in such a way".|$|E
2500|$|Midhurst was a 'free borough' and in 1278 {{was said}} to have been so from time beyond memory. It was governed by a bailiff who was elected by the burgesses from among themselves. [...] The bailiff {{regulated}} the market by ensuring the assize of bread and ale, appointing two ale-tasters yearly, and acted as clerk of the market. Disputes over the respective rights and duties of town and manor were settled in 1409 by an agreement whereby Michael Bageley and six other named burgesses agreed, on behalf <b>of</b> <b>themselves</b> <b>and</b> <b>their</b> successors, to pay 40 shillings a year to Sir John de Bohun, Lord of the Manor, and his heirs, for the right to take the market tolls. [...] In return they were required to hold both the three-weekly courts and to conduct two 'law days' in the name of Sir John. If they failed for a whole year to hold the courts the agreement should lapse, and if they neglected to keep the streets and ditches in order the lord's manorial officers should be responsible for apprehending offenders, but were required to hand over any fines to the burgesses. This arrangement was confirmed in 1537 by Sir William Fitzwilliam, after his purchase of the manor.|$|E
