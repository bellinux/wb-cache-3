5|$|The {{movement}} for indigenous {{cultural and political}} resurgence in Taiwan traces its roots to the ideals outlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948). Although the Republic of China was a UN member and signatory to the original UN Charter, four decades <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> controlled the discourse of culture and politics on Taiwan. The political liberalization Taiwan experienced {{leading up to the}} official end <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> on July 15, 1987, opened a new public arena for dissenting voices and political movements against the centralized policy of the KMT.|$|E
5|$|In December 1981, Poland's Wojciech Jaruzelski {{reacted to}} the crisis by {{imposing}} a period <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law.</b> Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland in response. Mikhail Suslov, the Kremlin's top ideologist, advised Soviet leaders not to intervene if Poland fell {{under the control of}} Solidarity, for fear it might lead to heavy economic sanctions, representing a catastrophe for the Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|At the State Defense Committee {{meeting on}} September 13 (the {{time of the}} Soviet Exercise Zapad-81 {{maneuvers}} and of renewed pressure on the Polish leadership), Kania was warned by the uniformed cadres that the progressing counterrevolution must be terminated by an imposition <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law.</b> The PZPR regional secretaries soon issued the same demands. Under the circumstances, in October First Secretary Kania stepped down and Prime Minister Jaruzelski became also the party chief.|$|E

5|$|In 1980-81 {{representatives from}} the Eastern Bloc nations met at the Kremlin to discuss the Polish situation. Brezhnev {{eventually}} concluded on 10 December 1981 {{that it would be}} better to leave the domestic matters of Poland alone, reassuring the Polish delegates that the USSR would intervene only if asked to. This effectively marked the end of the Brezhnev Doctrine. With domestic matters escalating out of control in Poland, Wojciech Jaruzelski imposed a state of war, the Polish version <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law,</b> on 12 December 1981.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of deteriorating {{conditions}} in the city attributed to French governance, the unpopular establishment <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law,</b> and the propaganda efforts of the rebels and their Turkish backers, many neighborhood leaders in Aleppo decided to recruit men to join Hananu's rebels, {{while many of the}} city's landowners and merchants donated funds to the rebel cause. The presence of 5,000 French Senegalese troops prevented an urban revolt that specifically targeted French forces, but in numerous incidents, Muslims from Aleppo's lower-income neighborhoods, such as Bab al-Nairab, violently assaulted members of the city's large Christian minority because they were viewed as being associated with French interests.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{previously}} held {{office at}} the Old Congress Building. In 1972, due to declaration <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law,</b> Congress was dissolved; its successor, the unicameral Batasang Pambansa, held {{office at the}} new Batasang Pambansa Complex. When a new constitution restored the bicameral Congress, the House of Representatives stayed at the Batasang Pambansa Complex, while the Senate remained at the Old Congress Building. In May 1997, the Senate transferred to a new building it shares with the Government Service Insurance System at reclaimed land at Pasay. The Supreme Court will also transfer to its new campus at Bonifacio Global City, Taguig in 2019.|$|E

5|$|In August 2008, Zardari relented, and the {{coalition}} agreed to proceed full speed towards Musharraf's impeachment by drafting a charge-sheet against him. The coalition charged him with high treason for the 1999 coup and the imposition <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law.</b> He warned Musharraf against dismissing Parliament, and {{the coalition}} selected Gillani instead of Musharraf to represent Pakistan at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

5|$|In August, several Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) generals {{proposed}} the imposition <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law,</b> ostensibly {{to break up}} the demonstrations, but in reality to prepare for a military coup. However, Nhu, already looking to arrest Buddhist leaders and crush the protest movement, used the opportunity to preempt the generals and embarrass them. He disguised Tung's Special Forces in army uniforms and used them to attack the Buddhists, thereby causing the general public and South Vietnam's U.S. allies to blame the army, diminishing the generals' reputations and ability to act as future national leaders.|$|E
5|$|In late August 1861, General John C. Frémont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without {{consulting}} his superiors in Washington, a proclamation <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be court-martialed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already {{under a cloud}} with charges of negligence in his command of the Department of the West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal. After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.|$|E
50|$|The 1981 {{strike at}} the Piast Coal Mine in Bieruń was the longest {{underground}} protest in the postwar history of Polish mining, and the longest strike <b>of</b> the <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> in Poland. It began on December 14, 1981, one day after introduction <b>of</b> the <b>martial</b> <b>law,</b> and ended on December 28, when approximately 1,000 protesting miners emerged from the mine. They spent two weeks underground, including Christmas, and ended the protest after the government guaranteed their safety.|$|R

On September25, it made a second landfall just south of Tampico, Tamaulipas with winds at around , and it quickly dissipated over land. Damage was heaviest there, estimated at $5million (1933USD) and {{there were hundreds of}} deaths. About 75% of the houses in Tampico were damaged, including about 50% of houses that had severe to total destruction to their roofs. The destruction prompted the declaration <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law,</b> and there was a curfew instated.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{heaviest}} fighting took place near {{the intersection of}} Wschodnia and Południowa (now Rewolucji 1905 r.) streets (where four barricades were located), near the Scheibler factory in the Źródliska park and on the Rokociny road (al. Piłsudskiego). The Rokociny area was manned by a 3,000-strong worker militia, which eventually was forced to retreat to the Źródliska park. The insurgents had no organized agenda, and commonly fought under red standards; common demands were the improvement of workers' living conditions and greater rights for the Polish population. On 23 June (or as late as 26 June – sources vary) the Tsar signed a decree <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> in the city.|$|E

On 12 March 1947, the Irgun penetrated the camp itself in a pre-dawn operation and detonated explosives {{in one of the}} buildings to protest the imposition <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> on Jerusalem. One British soldier was killed and eight injured in the blasts; martial law was lifted four days later.|$|E

5|$|As the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Belarusian Armed Forces, the President has {{the duty}} to protect the Belarusian {{territory}} from internal and external forces. The president can call for {{a state of emergency}} in the following cases: natural disasters, a catastrophe, or unrest involving violence or the threat of violence. Regardless if the declaration affects the entire country or sections of it, the Council of the Republic must be notified by the President and must seek their approval within three days of notification. The same rules applies if the President issues a state <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> {{in the event of a}} possible military action against Belarus. The President has to form and head the Security Council of the Republic of Belarus, and can appoint and dismiss the State Secretary of the Security Council and the Supreme Command of the Armed Forces.|$|E
5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many of the bills that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|For {{its part}} the government, not {{consulting}} Solidarity, adopted {{a plan of}} economic measures {{that could only be}} implemented by force and asked parliament for extraordinary authority. In early December, Jaruzelski was pressured by his generals and colonels for an immediate forceful action and their demands were repeated at the Politburo meeting on 10 December. On 11 and 12 December Solidarity's National Commission declared 17 December the day of countrywide protest. Neither the exhausted but radicalized Solidarity nor the ruling establishment was willing or able to back down and, in the era of Brezhnev, there could be no peaceful resolution to the situation that developed. The Soviets now expressed a preference for the conflict to be resolved by the Polish authorities, but Poland, according to Karol Modzelewski, was lucky to avoid a carnage of foreign intervention. Others, including the historian Antoni Dudek, feel that there was no sufficient justification for the imposition <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> that followed.|$|E

Immediately after the state of emergency was invoked, Bhutto returned to Pakistan, while Zardari again stayed behind in Dubai. Emergency rule was initiated right before the Supreme Court of Pakistan began deliberations on the legality of Musharraf's U.S.-backed proposal—the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO)—to drop corruption charges against Bhutto and Zardari in return for a joint Bhutto-Musharraf coalition to govern Pakistan. Bhutto and Zardari sympathised with Musharraf on his feud with the Supreme Court, but simultaneously criticised the imposition <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law.</b> Before the Supreme Court could issue a decision, Musharraf replaced its members with his supporters.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days, Chinese Foochow {{settlers}} in Sibu tried {{to convert the}} town into a rice cultivation centre. However, this vision did not materialise because the soil was not suitable for rice cultivation. In August 1909, Charles Brooke agreed to grant land titles to Sibu Chinese farmers and encouraged them to cultivate rubber plantations. The rise of rubber prices from 1909 to 1911 had encouraged another 2,000 Foochow settles to come to Sibu. The demand for rubber rose again during Korean War between 1950 and 1953 and has benefited Sibu rubber plantations. Local farmers later used the profits from rubber plantations into setting up shops at Sungai Merah and Durin bazaars and involve in more profitable timber industry. During the Sarawak Communist Insurgency in the 1970s, rural farmers had to abandon their rubber plantations because <b>of</b> <b>martial</b> <b>law</b> declared by the state government which forbade them for helping the communists operating in the jungles.|$|E
