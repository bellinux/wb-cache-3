5|$|Early Mormons {{understood}} the Book <b>of</b> <b>Mormon</b> to be a religious {{history of the}} indigenous peoples of the Americas. Smith's followers {{view it as a}} companion to the Bible and an additional witness of Christ, akin to a large apocryphal work. Modern historian Fawn Brodie has called the Book <b>of</b> <b>Mormon</b> a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of Smith's times, saying that Smith composed the Book <b>of</b> <b>Mormon</b> drawing from scraps of information available to him. Dan Vogel, another historian, says that the work is autobiographical in nature.|$|E

In 1898, when Kimball was three years old, his father was called {{as president of the}} St. Joseph Arizona Stake, and his family relocated to the town of Thatcher, in Southeastern Arizona's Graham County.|$|E
5|$|In July 1877, Young tried {{one more}} time at a {{spelling}} reform, ordering lead type designed for the orthography of Benn Pitman (Isaac's brother) {{with the intention of}} printing an edition of the Book <b>of</b> <b>Mormon</b> and Doctrine and Covenants using it. Most of the type had arrived by August, but with Young's death, the translation was never undertaken and the type never used. Young's death thus marked the end of the Mormon experimentation with English spelling reforms.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Smith Jr. (December 23, 1805 ‚Äì June 27, 1844) was an American {{religious}} leader {{and founder of}} Mormonism and the Latter Day Saint movement.

5|$|Mormons {{believe that}} the Star of Bethlehem was an actual astronomical event visible the world over. In the Book <b>of</b> <b>Mormon,</b> which they believe {{contains}} writings of ancient prophets, Samuel the Lamanite prophesies that a new star will appear {{as a sign that}} Jesus has been born, and Nephi later writes about the fulfillment of this prophecy.|$|E
5|$|The {{completed}} work, {{titled the}} Book <b>of</b> <b>Mormon,</b> {{was published in}} Palmyra on March 26, 1830, by printer E. B. Grandin. Soon after, on April 6, 1830, Smith and his followers formally organized the Church of Christ, and small branches were established in Palmyra, Fayette, and Colesville, New York. The Book <b>of</b> <b>Mormon</b> brought Smith regional notoriety and opposition from those who remembered his money-digging and the 1826 Chenango County trial. After Cowdery baptized several new church members, the Mormons received threats of mob violence; before Smith could confirm the newly baptized members, {{he was arrested and}} brought to trial as a disorderly person. He was acquitted, but soon both he and Cowdery fled to Colesville to escape a gathering mob. In probable reference to this period of flight, Smith said that Peter, James, and John had appeared to him and had ordained him and Cowdery to a higher priesthood.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several {{published}} versions of the alphabet. Most versions (including the versions used in The Deseret First Book, The Deseret Second Book, The Deseret News and The Book <b>of</b> <b>Mormon)</b> had only 38 letters, but some versions contained two ligatures, êêß (ew) and êê¶ (oi). In place of êêÆêê≠ or êê∑êê≠, êëè was to be used; in place of êê±êêÆ, êëé.|$|E
2500|$|Portrayals <b>of</b> <b>Mormons</b> and <b>of</b> Mormonism in both {{literature}} and movies have drawn criticism, with critics such as d'Arc describing {{the bulk of}} what the world heard <b>of</b> <b>Mormons</b> in the 19th and early-20th century, via {{the literature of the}} day, as [...] "polygamy, mystic revelations to modern prophets, golden bibles, and scheming missionaries adding continually to their harem of wives", and stating that this portrayal found its way into movies.|$|R
2500|$|The {{portrayal}} <b>of</b> <b>Mormons</b> in Cold Case {{has also}} drawn criticism from Chris Hicks for being disrespectful. He {{has stated that}} the program {{is an example of}} the unequal treatment <b>of</b> <b>Mormons,</b> stating that where insane people of other religions are portrayed in television drama, pains are taken to point out as part of the plot that they are [...] "non-practicing", yet no such pains are taken when it comes to Mormons. As a result, the faith is seen as directly related to the insanity of one character with the implication being that all Mormons are strange people. He also expressed concerns that the temple garments <b>of</b> <b>Mormons</b> did not receive the same sympathetic dramatic treatment or respect as do the sacred symbols of other religions.|$|R

5|$|According to Beesley, {{many have}} written that {{interest}} in the Deseret alphabet died with Brigham Young. This, however, isn't true; the alphabet was already regarded as a failure during Young's time. Only 500 copies of the full Book <b>of</b> <b>Mormon</b> translated into the Deseret alphabet sold for US$2 each, and even Young realized that the venture was too expensive {{and even the most}} devout Mormons could not be convinced to purchase and study the Deseret edition books over the books in the traditional orthography. In the winter of 1870, just one year after their publication, advertisements for the Deseret alphabet books were quietly removed from the Deseret News.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's death, Emma Smith {{quickly became}} alienated from Brigham Young {{and the church}} leadership. Young, whom Emma feared and despised, was {{suspicious}} of her desire to preserve the family's assets from inclusion {{with those of the}} church, and thought she would be even more troublesome because she openly opposed plural marriage. When most Latter Day Saints moved west, she stayed in Nauvoo, married a non-Mormon, Major Lewis C. Bidamon, and withdrew from religion until 1860, when she affiliated with the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, first headed by her son, Joseph Smith III. Emma never denied Smith's prophetic gift or repudiated her belief in the authenticity of the Book <b>of</b> <b>Mormon.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arrington helped {{establish}} the Mormon History Association in 1965 {{and served as}} its first president from 1966 to 1967. After Arrington's article caused the suspension of BYU studies, BYU Studies was wary of publishing any controversial material. Arrington formed the Mormon History Association in part to make a place where controversial material could be discussed. The association welcomed anyone {{with an interest in}} Mormon history. Wesley Johnson attended the inaugural meeting, and proposed that the association could publish Mormon studies articles in Dialogue: A Journal <b>of</b> <b>Mormon</b> Thought, a publication he helped form. Johnson's proposal was accepted and members of the Mormon History Association submitted papers to Dialogue.|$|E

5|$|By 1879, about 2,000 {{people were}} living in Silver Reef. The town had a mile-long Main Street with many businesses, among them a Wells Fargo office, the Rice Building, and the Cosmopolitan Restaurant. Although {{adjacent}} to many settlements with a majority <b>of</b> <b>Mormon</b> residents, the town never had a meeting house for Latter-day Saints, only a Catholic church. In 1879, a fire destroyed several businesses, but the residents rebuilt them. Mines were gradually closed, most of them by 1884, as the worldwide price of silver dropped. By 1901, most of the buildings in town had either been demolished or moved to Leeds.|$|E
5|$|In 1843, John C. Fremont led {{the first}} {{scientific}} {{expedition to the}} lake, but with winter coming on, {{he did not take}} the time to survey the entire lake. That happened in 1850 under the leadership of Howard Stansbury (Stansbury discovered and named the Stansbury mountain range and Stansbury island). John Fremont's overly glowing reports of the area were published shortly after his expedition. Stansbury also published a formal report of his survey work which became very popular. His report of the area included a discussion <b>of</b> <b>Mormon</b> religious practices based on Stansbury's interaction with the Mormon community in Great Salt Lake City, which had been established three years earlier in 1847.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, {{with the}} new type in hand, the Deseret News began {{printing}} with it. It would print one piece per issue in the new alphabet, usually a quotation from The Book <b>of</b> <b>Mormon</b> or the New Testament. However, this only lasted for one year, after which the practice stopped; it would start again in May 1864 and stop permanently {{at the end of}} that year.Benn Pitman, the brother of Isaac Pitman, was also interested in spelling reform, and by 1864 had published his own orthography, which the board of regents considered adopting. However, they ultimately decided not to and used the opportunity to re-affirm their commitment to the Deseret alphabet.|$|E

However, around the same time, Crown Prince Taufa'ahau Tupou IV returned from a trip to Australia where he realized that some changes should be made to the written Tongan language. Morton began working on a revised draft, but felt unacquainted with Tongan grammar. For a year, he studied the language and finally completely his revision on March 15, 1945. The Tongan version of the Book <b>of</b> <b>Mormon</b> was published in April 1946.|$|E
5|$|During {{the crisis}} of the Utah War in 1857, Brigham Young {{recalled}} Mormon colonists from the western areas of the proposed State of Deseret to the core area <b>of</b> <b>Mormon</b> settlement south of the Great Salt Lake. Alexander heeded the call, leaving his wife and son in Western Utah. With Alexander gone, Bowers and Robert left the abandoned settlement of Franktown for a small mining camp called Johntown in Gold Canyon near present-day Virginia City, Nevada. Bowers opened a boardinghouse and began taking care of the miners. When the threat of war passed, Alexander returned to Western Utah and settled in Johntown, but he did not wish to pursue the life of a Washoe miner. In the fall of 1858 he returned to Salt Lake City where he remained a prominent member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Bowers and Robert remained in Johntown.|$|E
5|$|In June 1847, Brannan {{traveled}} overland to Green River, Wyoming, to {{meet with}} Brigham Young, {{the head of the}} Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who was leading the first contingent <b>of</b> <b>Mormon</b> pioneers across the plains to the Great Basin region. Brannan urged Young to bring the Mormon pioneers to California as was previously planned, but Young rejected the proposal in favor of settling in what is present-day Utah. Brannan returned to northern California frustrated with how the meeting had gone. Being the only church leader of that region, Brannan continued to receive tithes of the church members, but no records have been found showing that those tithes were forwarded to the leaders of the church in Utah. Many members stopped paying him and began making their way eastward toward Salt Lake valley known to the Mormons as Zion.|$|E
2500|$|The portrayals <b>of</b> <b>Mormons</b> in {{the work}} of Orson Scott Card, himself a Mormon, have been viewed as {{sympathetic}} <b>of</b> the <b>Mormon</b> world view that reach hundreds of thousands of readers worldwide, and thus that form a useful starting point for Mormons to explain Mormonism to non-Mormons. Similarly, the portrayals <b>of</b> <b>Mormons</b> and <b>of</b> Mormonism presented by Harold Bloom (extolling Mormonism as the quintessential American religion, Charles Dickens (describing the industrious, orderly nature <b>of</b> the <b>Mormon</b> emigrants he encountered on a ship leaving England), John Stuart Mill (using Mormon beliefs as test cases for his assertion that government should not interfere in the private lives of individuals), George Bernard Shaw (carrying Mill's argument further), [...] Joseph Smith as [...] "an authentic religious genius, unique in our national history"), and Wallace Stegner (in The Gathering of Zion) are all seen as sympathetic to Mormons.|$|R
