If that subpart were actual (in the real world), then you'd chose the wrong.|$|E
5|$|The Final Fantasy Legend {{operates}} on a turn-based system {{similar to that}} of Final Fantasy II. The game's characters battle monsters and fiends using a variety of weapons, armor, and skills that develop through the player's actions. The game follows the story of four heroes who attempt to scale a tower at the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> supposedly leads to paradise. The four heroes may belong to one of three character classes, each housing a unique customization path.|$|E

The arrival of close friend, Steve McManaman, from Real Madrid gave Fowler hope, but the pair failed to rekindle their prolific partnership from their time at Liverpool, and received criticism from the fans and tabloids for their salaries, alleged excesses as well as named and shamed in a sex scandal covered by the News <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> <b>that</b> year.|$|E
5|$|Heathen {{influences}} were {{apparent in}} forms of black metal from the 1990s, where lyrics and themes often expressed {{a longing for}} a pre-Christian Northern past; the mass media typically associated this music genre with Satanism. The Pagan metal genre—which emerged from the fragmentation of the extreme metal scene in Northern Europe during the early 1990s—came {{to play an important}} role in the North European Pagan scene. Many musicians involved in Viking metal were also practicing Heathens, with many metal bands embracing the heroic masculinity embodied in Norse mythological figures like Odin and Thor. From the mid-1990s, the Internet greatly aided the propagation of Heathenry in various parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> <b>That</b> decade also saw the strong growth of racist Heathenry among those incarcerated within the U.S. prison system as a result of outreach programs established by various Heathen groups, a project begun in the 1980s. During this period, many Heathen groups also began to interact increasingly with other ethnic-oriented Pagan groups in Eastern Europe, such as Lithuanian Romuva, and many joined the World Congress of Ethnic Religions upon its formation in 1998.|$|E

5|$|Spiritualism {{appealed to}} many educated Victorians {{who no longer}} found {{traditional}} religious doctrine, {{such as that of}} the Church of England, acceptable yet were unsatisfied with the completely materialistic and mechanical view <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> was increasingly emerging from 19th-century science. However, several scholars who have researched Wallace's views in depth have emphasised that, for him, spiritualism was a matter of science and philosophy rather than religious belief. Among other prominent 19th-century intellectuals involved with spiritualism were the social reformer Robert Owen, who was one of Wallace's early idols, the physicists William Crookes and Lord Rayleigh, the mathematician Augustus De Morgan, and the Scottish publisher Robert Chambers.|$|E
5|$|The cunning Fox is {{commonly}} found in Native American mythology, where it is portrayed as an almost constant companion to Coyote. Fox, however, is a deceitful companion that often steals Coyote's food. In the Achomawi creation myth, Fox and Coyote are the co-creators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>that</b> leave just {{before the arrival of}} humans. The Yurok tribe believed that Fox, in anger, captured the sun, and tied him to a hill, causing him to burn a great hole in the ground. An Inuit story tells of how Fox, portrayed as a beautiful woman, tricks a hunter into marrying her, only to resume her true form and leave after he offends her. A Menominee story tells of how Fox is an untrustworthy friend to the Wolf.|$|E
5|$|The {{language}} family <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> has {{the most}} speakers is the Indo-European languages, spoken by 46% of the world's population. This family includes major world languages like English, Spanish, Russian, and Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu). The Indo-European family achieved prevalence first during the Eurasian Migration Period (c. 400–800 AD), and subsequently through the European colonial expansion, which brought the Indo-European languages to a politically and often numerically dominant position in the Americas and much of Africa. The Sino-Tibetan languages are spoken by 20% of the world's population and include many of the languages of East Asia, including Hakka, Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese, and hundreds of smaller languages.|$|E

5|$|Two years later, {{the ship}} began her next {{training}} cruise on 21 August 1920, visiting South America and the South Sea Islands, before returning on 4 April 1921. On 1 September, she was re-designated as a 1st-class coast-defense ship. On 26 June 1922, Iwate, accompanied by Izumo and Yakumo, began a circumnavigation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> {{took them to}} Hawaii, Los Angeles, California, through the Panama Canal to Rio de Janeiro, where the cadets viewed the Independence Centenary International Exposition commemorating Brazilian independence. The ships then visited Buenos Aires, Argentina and Durban, South Africa before heading home via the Indian Ocean, where they arrived on 8 February 1923.|$|E
5|$|There {{were few}} {{airborne}} {{resources available to}} the British Army by mid-1941. The only unit trained and available for an airborne operation was No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion, {{there were very few}} transport aircraft available to transport an airborne force, there were few RAF flight crews with experience of parachute droppings and none with operational experience, and there were no specialized overseas facilities to cater exclusively for airborne operations. However, it had been decided that some form of airborne operation would have to be carried out. The reasons for mounting an operation with such meagre resources were two-fold; firstly a successful raid would demonstrate to the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> Britain was still {{a force to be reckoned}} with and had not been defeated, and secondly a raid would test the fighting ability of the battalion and its equipment, as well as the RAF's ability to deliver paratroopers at a predetermined location at a required time. The target chosen for the operation was an aqueduct that crossed the Tragino river in the Campania province of southern Italy near the town of Calitri. The aqueduct carried the main water supply for the province of Apulia, which at the time was inhabited by approximately two million Italians and included the strategically important port of Taranto; it was hoped that destroying the aqueduct and depriving the population of their regular water supply would damage their morale, and also have some impact on the Italian war efforts in North Africa and Albania. The aqueduct was a significant distance from the Italian coast, making it unlikely that a sea-borne raiding party could reach it, and it was believed that it was too strongly constructed to be destroyed by aerial bombing; as such, an airborne raid conducted by parachute troops was thought to be the ideal way to eliminate the aqueduct.|$|E
