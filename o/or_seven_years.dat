5|$|According to {{traditional}} sources Aisha was six <b>or</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old when betrothed to Muhammad, with the marriage not being consummated {{until she had}} reached puberty {{at the age of}} nine or ten years old.

Modern Muslim authors who calculate Aisha's age based on other sources of information, such that available about her sister Asma about whom more is known, estimate that she was over thirteen and perhaps in her late teens {{at the time of her}} marriage.|$|E
5|$|Beilhart {{was born}} March 4, 1867 in Columbiana County, Ohio to a Lutheran {{father and a}} Mennonite mother. The ninth of 11 children, Beilhart {{was raised in the}} Lutheran church and his early home {{environment}} was strictly religious. Jacob did not receive {{much in the way of}} formal education. His father died when he was six <b>or</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> old so Jacob attended only elementary school. At the age of 17, Beilhart went to work at his brother-in-law's harness shop in southern Ohio and, when they moved to Ottawa, Kansas, Jacob went with them.|$|E

5|$|In Zoha Prison in Romania, {{there are}} {{interviews}} with traffickers serving prison sentences {{that the film}} suggested were too short {{in light of the}} severity of the crime of human trafficking. The typical sentence for this crime is six <b>or</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years,</b> while the sentence for trafficking in drugs is normally twenty years. Two Romanian traffickers, Traian and Ovidiu, attest to having starved, punched, and kicked the girls they trafficked. Ovidiu recounts a story, in an interview filmed in February 2007, about kidnapping a prostitute and selling her for sex when he was 14. He expresses no remorse for these actions. The sentences served by Traian and Ovidiu were short enough that, by the time the film was released, they were no longer in prison. Ana, a girl they trafficked, is also interviewed in the film, saying that she lost a tooth in one of her beatings. She describes being pregnant at the time, but not telling this to her captors because of fears for the unborn child's safety.|$|E
5|$|Xenogears {{composer}} Yasunori Mitsuda {{announced plans}} to create an album of orchestral arrangements of music from that game on October 6, 2010, via his Twitter account. Mitsuda had previously released two albums of music from the game, both in 1998, the year the game was released—Xenogears Original Soundtrack, a soundtrack album for the game, and Creid, an album of arranged music inspired by Celtic folk music and Japanese rock. He {{has said that he}} decided to make the album due to the emotions that he and fans still felt about the game 13 years after its release, which led him to want to commemorate that. The music of Xenogears is particularly close to Mitsuda, as it was the last soundtrack that he worked on for Square Enix—the first video game company he worked for—and he knew that he would be leaving when he composed the soundtrack for the game. He has said that he had been considering the idea of a Xenogears orchestral album for six <b>or</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> prior to starting on it, but until then did not have both the opportunity to work on the project and the confidence in his own abilities as an orchestrator to make the album sound as he wished.|$|E
5|$|Yeovil and County Cricket Club {{was formed}} in 1865, {{and was the first}} attempt at setting up a county cricket team for Somerset. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the club broke up. In 1874, the club was re-formed with the lesser remit, as Yeovil Cricket Club. As part of the club's resuscitation, the {{committee}} purchased the use of a field in West Hendford in Yeovil, from a local farmer, Mr Brook. The field, part of Key Farm, was leased for £10. There is record of a match being played on the ground the following year between two sets of members of the Yeovil Cricket Club. During the late 19th-century, the ground was used for other sports as well as cricket; it had a grass athletics track, and also hosted Yeovil Football Club, who at the time played both association and rugby football. The football club played at West Hendford on an irregular basis during the late 19th-century, but returned in 1935, by which time they only played rugby, and had changed their name accordingly to Yeovil Rugby Club. In 1895, the cricket club committee announced that there was provision for a longer lease, of five <b>or</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years,</b> and that they would make improvements to the ground to enable it to host first-class cricket. The ground was also used for field hockey in the early 20th-century, hosting a Yeovil Hockey Club.|$|E

25|$|Following Zhuge Liang's {{death in}} 234, Lü Yi was first reassigned {{to be the}} Administrator of Guanghan Commandery (廣漢郡; around present-day Zhongjiang County, Sichuan) and later as the Administrator of Shu Commandery (蜀郡; around present-day Chengdu, Sichuan). As Shu Commandery was centred around the {{imperial}} capital, Chengdu, it had the largest population among all the commanderies. In the six <b>or</b> <b>seven</b> <b>years</b> of relative peace after Zhuge Liang's death, the Shu government decided to give out compensation to war veterans.

When Lü Yi found out, he immediately imposed stricter regulations to prevent such abuses of the system. At the same time, he also counselled the people and explained to them the benefits of serving in the military. His efforts proved successful as within a few years, over 10,000 men voluntarily joined the army.|$|E
