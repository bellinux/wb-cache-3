5|$|The {{assembly}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> (i.e., {{the citizens}} of Rome), the Comitia Tributa, was presided over by a consul, and was composed of 35 tribes. The tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups, but rather geographical subdivisions. The order that the thirty-five tribes would vote in was selected randomly by lot. Once a measure received support from a majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes,</b> the voting would end. While it did not pass many laws, the Comitia Tributa did elect quaestors, curule aediles, and military tribunes. The Plebeian Council was identical to the assembly <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes,</b> but excluded the patricians (the elite who could trace their ancestry to the founding of Rome). They elected their own officers, plebeian tribunes and plebeian aediles. Usually a plebeian tribune would preside over the assembly. This assembly passed most laws, and could also act as a court of appeal.|$|E
5|$|Despite American {{hunger for}} land, the {{leadership}} in the Minnesota Territory did not actually want to remove the Sioux from the territory. Federal subsidies to the tribes were heavily siphoned by the U.S. settlements and removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> from the territory would have meant loss of this income.|$|E
5|$|Fort Sill was {{established}} in 1869 after the American Civil War by Major General Philip Sheridan, who was leading a campaign in the Indian Territory to stop raids into Texas by American Indian tribes. In 1874, the Red River War {{broke out in the}} region when the Comanche, Kiowa, and Southern Cheyenne left their Indian Territory reservation. Attrition and skirmishes by the US Army finally forced the return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> back to Indian Territory in June 1875.|$|E

5|$|The Tang emperor Gaozong {{installed}} two puppet qaghans, {{the cousins}} Ashina Buzhen and Ashina Mishe, and controlled the region by proxy. Buzhen and Mishe were enemies of Helu who had aided Su Dingfang {{during his campaign}} against Helu and the Western Turkic Khaganate. Gaozong divided the ten tribes of the area among the two cousins. Buzhen governed half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> located in the west, while Mishe governed the other half located in the east.|$|E

5|$|In 1927, the California {{legislature}} {{passed a}} statute authorizing the California Attorney General to bring claims on behalf <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> in the Court of Claims. The next year, Congress passed a statute granting that court jurisdiction for such claims. California Attorney General Earl Warren (future Chief Justice) finally argued {{the case in}} 1941. The court found liability but indicated it would not award pre-judgment interest, and the Supreme Court declined to grant certiorari. Warren negotiated a $5M settlement. After {{the passage of the}} Indian Claims Commission Act, the same group of tribes struggled to bring a single action for recovery under the broader claims allowed under the ICCA, which settled for $29M.|$|E
5|$|The Han {{expanded}} further during Emperor Ming's reign (57–75 CE). The new commandery of Yongchang (永昌郡) {{was established}} in what is modern Baoshan, Yunnan in the former Dian Kingdom. The Dian tribes west of Yuexi Commandery (越巂, modern Xichang in southern Sichuan) submitted to Han rule in 114 CE. Emperor Huang (r. 146-168) encouraged the cultural assimilation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> during his reign between. Under Emperor Huangti, sinicization of the Dian involved the teaching of Chinese ethics and Han Chinese culture was promoted in Yunnan.

Throughout the war, the British were unable to project military power into the Illinois Country, which was on the remote western edge of the conflict. The Illinois tribes were the last {{to come to terms with}} the British.|$|E
5|$|While {{the society}} is matrilineal, it is not matriarchal. In past monarchies of the state, {{the son of the}} {{youngest}} sister of the king inherited the throne. Even now in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly or village councils or panchayats the representation of women in politics is minimal. As of 2013, in a Meghalaya Legislative Assembly of 60 members, there are only four women. In the male centric Dorbar Shnong, which is the basic political arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes,</b> women are not permitted to hold office. However, women feel that they take better care of money matters than men and they enjoy economic freedom.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius {{enacted a}} series of {{constitutional}} reforms in the 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted {{in the creation of}} a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the Tribe, was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the army. In 471 BC, a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized on the basis of the Curia. The only difference between the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized on the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tribes)</b> was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.|$|E

5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} around the Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet) that became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes {{that they would be}} protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would rise up against the whites. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to only pay white traders half of what they owed, and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, whiskey, and guns. In 1810, Tecumseh, with about 400 armed warriors, traveled to Vincennes where he confronted Harrison and demanded that the Treaty of Fort Wayne be rescinded. Although Harrison refused, the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh was angry and threatened retaliation. After the meeting Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> in the region, hoping to create a confederation with which to battle the Americans.|$|E
5|$|Because of this {{beginning}} of the incursion of Europeans into the area, {{the members of the}} Confederacy helped shape the development of North America throughout the 18th century, becoming a centre of trade and culture. Great Britain supported this strengthening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> in the area as a set of allies against the French and the Iroqouis. The people of the Three Fires Confederacy, however, sided with the French during the Seven Years' War and only made peace with Great Britain after the Treaty of Fort Niagara in 1764. It also fought {{on the side of the}} British during the War of 1812. The Three Fires Confederacy also broke several treaties with the United States prior to 1815, but finally signed the Treaty of Springwells in September of that year and ceased all hostilities directed at the United States. The Grand Council survived intact until the middle to late 19th century, when more modern political systems began to evolve.|$|E
5|$|By {{the later}} {{years of the}} war, many Abenakis had tired of the {{conflict}} despite French pressures to continue raids against New England targets. The peace of Utrecht, however, had ignored Indian interests, and some Abenaki expressed willingness to negotiate a peace with the New Englanders. Governor Dudley organized a major peace conference at Portsmouth, New Hampshire (of which he was also governor). In negotiations there and at Casco Bay, the Abenakis objected to British assertions that the French had ceded to Britain the territory of eastern Maine and New Brunswick, but they agreed to a confirmation of boundaries at the Kennebec River {{and the establishment of}} government-run trading posts in their territory. The Treaty of Portsmouth was ratified on July 13, 1713 by eight representatives of some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> of the Wabanaki Confederacy; however, it included language asserting British sovereignty over their territory. Over the next year, other Abenaki tribal leaders also signed the treaty, but no Mi'kmaq ever signed it or any other treaty until 1726.|$|E

5|$|California was {{admitted}} as a U.S. state on September 9, 1850. The admission act made {{no reference to}} Native American land rights. On their second day in office as California's first Senators, John Fremont and William M. Gwin introduced bills to extinguish all aboriginal title in California. On September 30, 1850, Congress passed an amended version of Fremont's bill appropriating $25,000 and authorizing the President to appoint three commissioners to negotiate treaties with the tribes of California. By January 1852, eighteen treaties had been negotiated, representing about one-third <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> and bands in the state. The state legislature strongly opposed the Indian reservation policy pursued by the treaty and lobbied {{the federal government to}} instead remove the Indians from the state entirely. Because Fremont and Gwin represented the key swing votes between the Whig and Democratic parties, none of the treaties were ever ratified and all were classified.|$|E
5|$|Early Philippine {{sculpture}} {{is characterized}} by frontal nudity. One of the earliest forms are the bulols by the Ifugao people which serve as an assurance for bountiful harvests. The original function of these sculptures {{are related to the}} ceremonies and beliefs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> who created them. Arab and Russian missionaries also brought beveled type of carvings in the form of Okkil. The beginnings of this sculpture type started with the Islamization of Sulu. The Spanish colonization of the country did not hinder Filipinos creating sculptures for objects of adoration. During this time, sculptures of deities and saints were used to teach Filipinos Christian doctrines. During the American colonialism, worshippers of faith were not discouraged to sculpt in order to adorn churches. Filipinos' first exposure to painting happened when Spain conquered the Philippines and these were used as religious propaganda often displayed in churches. However, as education progressed and wealth increased, more and more artists started to shift from the traditional religious motifs to a more secular pattern of imagery.|$|E
5|$|James Campbell refutes {{suggestions}} that the hides given for each tribe were {{the sum of}} a system of locally-collected assessments and argues that a two-tier system of assessment, one for large areas such as kingdoms and a more accurate one for individual estates, may have existed. He considers the possibility that many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>tribes</b> named in the Tribal Hidage were no more than administrative units and that some names did not originate from a tribe itself but from a place from where the people were governed, eventually coming to signify the district where the tribe itself lived. Barbara Yorke suggests that the -sætan/sæte form of several of the place-names are an indication that they were named after a feature of the local landscape. She also suggests the tribes were dependent administrative units and not independent kingdoms, some of which were created as such after the main kingdoms were stabilized.|$|E
