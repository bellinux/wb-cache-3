Many of the workers were swept to sea on barges and flatboats; however, the steamer Jenny rescued 42 workers, who were dropped off at Key West, while another 24 were sent to Savannah, Georgia. The railway's losses totaled about $200,000. Construction was disrupted {{for a whole year}} by the storm, as equipment was reassembled and repaired. Many farmers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> Keys suffered large losses; orange groves and fields of pineapples were devastated by the storm. Six lives were lost on plantations in the Keys. At the government wharf, the Fessenden was damaged during the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Of the 240 {{people killed}} during the storm, 135 were workers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> East Coast Railway. The {{hurricane}} {{eventually led to the}} end of pineapple production in the Florida Keys for commercial purposes in 1915, although this was amplified by two further hurricanes in the following years. In 1947, Project Cirrus, a collaboration of the United States Air Force, attempted to modify a hurricane; however, the seeded storm made a sudden re-curvature and came ashore near Charleston, South Carolina. As a result, several lawsuits were filed, although they were denied after the path of this storm was revealed to have been similar to the 1906 hurricane.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2005, a {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the west coast}} of Africa. Gradually, the system organized on July 2 and formed a broad low pressure area. The system continued to organize, and became {{a tropical}} depression on July 4. Tracking westward, it became a tropical storm on July 5 and a hurricane on July 7. Dennis rapidly intensified to attain Category4 status on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale before making landfall on Cuba. The storm weakened to Category1 status before re-emerging in the Gulf of Mexico and intensifying. Dennis made landfall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> Panhandle on July 10 before tracking over Alabama as a minimal hurricane.|$|E

Four of the tornadoes were rated F0 on the Fujita scale, two were rated F1, and one was given an F2 rating with estimated wind speeds of 113ndash&157 mph (181ndash&253 km/h).|$|E
5|$|The Effects of Hurricane Dennis in Alabama, USA {{included}} $127million (2005USD) {{in damage}} and three injuries.

In {{preparation for the}} storm, about 500,000people were given evacuation orders, and the Red Cross opened 87shelters. As a result, all southbound lanes of Interstate 65 from Mobile to Montgomery were closed.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane Agnes, {{which at the time}} was the costliest United States hurricane, until Frederic in 1979. After brushing the western tip of Cuba, the hurricane made landfall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> Panhandle. It caused at least $2.1billion (1972USD) in damage and 137fatalities, mostly from inland flooding in Pennsylvania and New York. The strongest hurricane of the season was Betty, which reached peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) while west of the Azores. Tropical Storm Carrie passed just offshore of Massachusetts, causing heavy rainfall and resulting in four fatalities, but leaving only $1.78million in damage.|$|E

The Assistant United States Coast Surveyor reported that in the period from 1845 through 1849, almost one million (United States) dollars worth of vessels and cargoes were lost on the reef.|$|E
5|$|The season {{produced}} nineteen tropical or subtropical cyclones, {{of which}} seven intensified into tropical or subtropical storms; three became hurricanes, but none further intensified into major hurricanes, {{the first such}} occurrence since the 1968 season. Despite the inactivity, the 1972 season resulted {{in one of the}} worst natural disasters in American history, Hurricane Agnes. Agnes was a weak but large storm that initially made landfall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> Panhandle before moving up the eastern United States. The hurricane killed 122 people and caused $2.1billion (1972USD) in damage, mostly due to flooding in Pennsylvania and New York.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Ten was a {{short-lived}} tropical cyclone that made landfall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> Panhandle in September2007. The system {{developed as a}} subtropical depression on September21 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico from the interaction of a tropical wave, {{the tail end of}} a cold front, and an upper-level low. Initially containing a poorly defined circulation and intermittent thunderstorm activity, the system transitioned into a tropical depression after convection increased over the center. Tracking northwestward, the depression moved ashore near Fort Walton Beach early on September22 and dissipated over southeastern Alabama shortly thereafter.|$|E

It crossed western Cuba on June 10 and strengthened to just under hurricane strength before making its final landfall <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Florida</b> Panhandle the next day. The storm weakened as it continued to move north over the United States, becoming extratropical on June 13. Arlene was responsible for only one death and minor damages.|$|E

Most Calusa villages were located at the mouths of rivers or on key islands. The Calusa were hunter-gatherers who lived on small game, fish, turtles, alligators, shellfish, and various plants. Most of their tools were made of bone or teeth, although sharpened reeds were also effective for hunting or war. Calusa weapons consisted of bows and arrows, atlatls, and spears. Canoes were used for transportation, and South Florida tribes often canoed through the Everglades, but rarely lived in them. Canoe trips to Cuba were also common.|$|E
