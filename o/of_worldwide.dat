5|$|Despite {{the prior}} belief that {{schizophrenia}} occurs at similar rates worldwide, its frequency varies across the world, within countries, {{and at the}} local and neighborhood level. This variation has been estimated to be fivefold. It causes approximately one percent <b>of</b> <b>worldwide</b> disability adjusted life years and resulted in 20,000 deaths in 2010.

5|$|Iron is {{the most}} widely used of all the metals, {{accounting}} for over 90% <b>of</b> <b>worldwide</b> metal production. Its low cost and high strength make it indispensable in engineering applications such as the construction of machinery and machine tools, automobiles, the hulls of large ships, and structural components for buildings.

5|$|Like capital, {{the end of}} proto-globalization {{was filled}} with {{mobility}} of individuals. The time of proto-globalization was one filled with “mutual influence, hybridization, and cross-cultural entanglement”. Many historians blame this web of national entanglements and agreements as the cause for the intensity and vast involvement during World War I. Between 1750-1880, the expansion <b>of</b> <b>worldwide</b> integration {{was influenced by the}} new capacities in production, transportation, and communication.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the demand}} for {{germanium}} for fiber optic communication networks, infrared night vision systems, and polymerization catalysts increased dramatically. These end uses represented 85% <b>of</b> <b>worldwide</b> germanium consumption in 2000.

Manufacturing delays led to a staggered release beginning in late March, with its release date in certain markets (such as Asia and North America) pushed to late-April. Nevertheless, with around 5 million units being sold during its first two months <b>of</b> <b>worldwide</b> availability, HTC stated that the One was the most successful launch in the company’s history.|$|E
5|$|Britain was {{the world}} leader in the {{construction}} of railways, and their use to expand trade and coal supplies. The first successful locomotive-powered line in Scotland, between Monkland and Kirkintilloch, opened in 1831. Not only was good passenger service established by the late 1840s, but an excellent network of freight lines reduce the cost of shipping coal, and made products manufactured in Scotland competitive throughout Britain. For example, railways opened the London market to Scottish beef and milk. They enabled the Aberdeen Angus to become a cattle breed <b>of</b> <b>worldwide</b> reputation.|$|E

By the early 1970s, OPEC's membership {{accounted for more than}} half <b>of</b> <b>worldwide</b> oil production. Indicating that OPEC is not averse to further expansion, Mohammed Barkindo, OPEC's Acting Secretary General in 2006, urged his African neighbors Angola and Sudan to join, and Angola did in 2007, followed by Equatorial Guinea in 2017. Since the 1980s, representatives from Egypt, Mexico, Norway, Oman, Russia, and other oil-exporting nations have attended many OPEC meetings as observers, as an informal mechanism for coordinating policies.|$|E

5|$|Most acetate esters, however, are {{produced}} from acetaldehyde using the Tishchenko reaction. In addition, ether acetates {{are used as}} solvents for nitrocellulose, acrylic lacquers, varnish removers, and wood stains. First, glycol monoethers {{are produced}} from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with alcohol, which are then esterified with acetic acid. The three major products are {{ethylene glycol monoethyl ether}} acetate (EEA), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate (EBA), and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA, more commonly known as PGMEA in semiconductor manufacturing processes, where it is used as a resist solvent). This application consumes about 15% to 20% <b>of</b> <b>worldwide</b> acetic acid. Ether acetates, for example EEA, {{have been shown to be}} harmful to human reproduction.|$|E
5|$|The notable {{properties}} of germania (GeO2) are its high {{index of refraction}} and its low optical dispersion. These make it especially useful for wide-angle camera lenses, microscopy, and the core part of optical fibers. It has replaced titania as the dopant for silica fiber, eliminating the subsequent heat treatment that made the fibers brittle. At the end of 2002, the fiber optics industry consumed 60% of the annual germanium use in the United States, but this is less than 10% <b>of</b> <b>worldwide</b> consumption. GeSbTe is a phase change material used for its optic properties, such as that used in rewritable DVDs.|$|E
