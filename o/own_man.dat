5|$|Lame duck {{president}} John Quincy Adams nominated Crittenden to the U.S. Supreme Court on December 17, 1828 but Senators {{who supported}} president-elect Jackson voted to postpone confirmation until Jackson could nominate his <b>own</b> <b>man.</b> After his brief service as Kentucky Secretary of State, {{the state legislature}} elected Crittenden to the second of his four non-consecutive stints in the U.S. Senate. Upon his election as president, William Henry Harrison appointed Crittenden as Attorney General, but 5 months after Harrison's death, political differences prompted him to resign rather than continue his service under Harrison's successor, John Tyler.|$|E

Nicola arrives, fed up with Charlie's obsession over the factory, and breaks up with him. Lola has been making some decisions about production and preparations without consulting Charlie. When he discovers that she has decided to have her angels wear the boots on the runway rather than hiring professional models, an overwhelmed Charlie lashes out at her, humiliating {{her in front of}} the other workers. Lola storms out, and the factory workers go home. Alone, Charlie struggles with the weight of his father's legacy and what it means to be his <b>own</b> <b>man</b> ("Soul of a Man").|$|E

5|$|Financial {{difficulties}} and instability at board level led to six managerial changes in seven years. Saunders resigned after FA Cup defeat to non-league Altrincham, John Bond {{seemed out of}} touch, and in April 1989, once relegation to the Third Division {{for the first time}} in the club's history was confirmed, the club's new owners replaced Garry Pendrey with Dave Mackay. Within 18 months, with relegation to the Fourth Division a possibility, Mackay resigned. Lou Macari came in, revitalised the side, won the Associate Members' Cup at Wembley, and three weeks later walked out to join Stoke City. Terry Cooper won promotion back to the second tier and kept the team going during four months of administration before he quit, fearing new owner David Sullivan would want to bring in his <b>own</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1138 King Stephen chose Theobald to {{fill the}} vacant archbishopric of Canterbury over Stephen's own brother Henry, the Bishop of Winchester, who had helped Stephen gain the throne of England. Stephen feared that Henry would be too {{powerful}} as archbishop, and would attempt to control the king. The election took place on 24December; Stephen was present with the papal legate, Alberic of Ostia, and {{a small group of}} barons and bishops, but Henry was absent overseeing the ordination of deacons. Most historians consider that Stephen arranged the election's timing to ensure Henry's absence. Henry believed that Theobald had been elected not only because of Stephen's concerns but also because Waleran of Meulan, the lay patron of Bec, was attempting to put his <b>own</b> <b>man</b> {{in one of the most}} powerful positions in England. Waleran and his twin brother Robert, Earl of Leicester, were Henry's chief rivals for Stephen's favour, and Henry disliked both of them intensely. Although Theobald was pious and well-educated, he had only become abbot the year before, and his election was probably influenced by the reputation of his monastery, which had already produced two archbishops of Canterbury, Lanfranc and Anselm. Theobald had no important family connections to advance his career, and few clerical allies.|$|E

25|$|An {{unfinished}} religious manifesto, De doctrina christiana, probably {{written by}} Milton, lays out {{many of his}} heterodox theological views, and was not discovered and published until 1823. Milton's key beliefs were idiosyncratic, not those of an identifiable group or faction, and often they go well beyond the orthodoxy of the time. Their tone, however, stemmed from the Puritan emphasis on the centrality and inviolability of conscience. He was his <b>own</b> <b>man,</b> but he was anticipated by Henry Robinson in Areopagitica.|$|E

25|$|Battles ensued {{between the}} armies of Kublai and those of his brother Ariqboke, which {{included}} forces still loyal to MÃ¶ngke's previous administration. Kublai's army easily eliminated Ariqboke's supporters and seized control of the civil administration in southern Mongolia. Further challenges took place from their cousins, the Chagataids. Kublai sent Abishka, a Chagataid prince loyal to him, {{to take charge of}} Chagatai's realm. But Ariqboke captured and then executed Abishka, having his <b>own</b> <b>man</b> Alghu crowned there instead. Kublai's new administration blockaded Ariqboke in Mongolia to cut food supplies, causing a famine. Karakorum fell quickly to Kublai, but Ariqboke rallied and re-took the capital in 1261.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt had {{attempted}} to refashion Taft into a younger version of himself, {{but as soon as}} Taft began to display his individuality, the former president expressed his disenchantment. He was offended on election night when Taft indicated that his success had been possible not just through the efforts of Roosevelt, but also his brother Charley. Roosevelt was further alienated when Taft, intent on becoming his <b>own</b> <b>man,</b> did not consult him about cabinet appointments. Roosevelt and other progressives were also dissatisfied over Taft's conservation policies and his handling of the tariff, which had indirectly concentrated more {{power in the hands of}} conservative party leaders in Congress.|$|E
25|$|The {{county board}} called an {{emergency}} {{meeting to discuss}} {{the recommendations of the}} arbitration and especially the recommendation from Mulvey that Holland should resign. By 16 February, uncertainty had emerged over the status of the strike. While the county board and Holland met to discuss the issues, an expected vote by the county board to remove Holland was never called. Holland meanwhile issued a statement that didn't indicate if he had stepped down and stated that he was neutral saying: I am my <b>own</b> <b>man</b> and I am proud to be a Cork football man. Holland said the claim that six people had refused the job before him was false and there was no threat of strike when he took the job. However, a statement in support of the strike had been issued by the Gaelic Players Association on 13 November 2007, a week before Holland took the job.|$|E

25|$|The {{first sign}} that Tobin had a {{challenger}} within the Teamsters came in 1947. Dave Beck had risen steadily in the Teamsters hierarchy in the Pacific Northwest, becoming {{president of the}} Western Conference of Teamsters in 1937 and an international vice-president in 1940. As Beck's influence rose, Tobin attempted to check his growing power but failed. After Beck's election as vice-president, he began to challenge Tobin {{for control of the}} union. In 1947, Beck marshaled his forces and defeated a proposed dues increase to fund new organizing. In 1942, he began a six-year campaign to seize control of the International Teamster newsmagazine. He ousted its editor and won the executive board's approval to install his <b>own</b> <b>man</b> in the job in 1948. In 1946, Beck successfully campaigned to amend the union's constitution to create the post of executive vice-president. He subsequently won the 1947 election to fill the position.|$|E
25|$|Vanderbilt {{subsequently}} played {{another critical}} role on Amasa Stone's railroad career. Vanderbilt wanted {{control of the}} Lake Shore Railway, which had formed out {{of a combination of}} smaller Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois railroads on March 31, 1868. In May 1868, Vanderbilt's proxies attended the first Lake Shore stockholders' meeting, and discovered that LeGrand Lockwood had a sizeable financial interest in the company. Vanderbilt was defeated in his attempt to install his <b>own</b> <b>man</b> as the Lake Shore's president. During the next several months, Lockwood worked with investor and robber baron Jay Gould, who was engaged in the Erie War for control of the Erie Railroad and wanted to divert all Lake Shore traffic to the Erie. On August 19, 1869, Lockwood and Gould rammed their plan through the Lake Shore's board of directors. Vanderbilt fought them, but his only victory was in securing the election of Amasa Stone to the Lake Shore's board. Stone served until his health failed again in 1875, when he resigned.|$|E
25|$|The great wave of {{organizing}} which the union engaged {{in during the}} Great Depression and the war significantly boosted {{the political power of}} a number of regional Teamsters leaders, and the leadership of the union engaged in a number of power struggles in the post-war period. By 1949, the union's membership had topped one million. Dave Beck (elected an international vice-president in 1940) was increasingly influential in the international union, and Tobin attempted to check his growing power but failed. In 1946, Beck successfully overcame Tobin's opposition and won approval of an amendment to the union's constitution creating the post of executive vice-president. Beck then won the 1947 election to fill the position. Beck also successfully opposed in 1947 a Tobin-backed dues increase to fund new organizing. The following year, Beck was able to demand the ouster of the editor of International Teamster magazine and install his <b>own</b> <b>man</b> in the job.|$|E

25|$|In the 1908 election, Taft easily {{defeated}} the Democratic nominee, three-time candidate William Jennings Bryan. Taft promoted a progressivism that stressed {{the rule of}} law; he preferred that judges rather than administrators or politicians make the basic decisions about fairness. Taft usually {{proved to be a}} less adroit politician than Roosevelt and lacked the energy and personal magnetism, along with the publicity devices, the dedicated supporters, and the broad base of public support that made Roosevelt so formidable. When Roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would risk creating severe tensions inside the Republican Party by pitting producers (manufacturers and farmers) against merchants and consumers, he stopped talking about the issue. Taft ignored the risks and tackled the tariff boldly, encouraging reformers to fight for lower rates, and then cutting deals with conservative leaders that kept overall rates high. The resulting Payne-Aldrich tariff of 1909, signed into law early in President Taft's tenure, was too high for most reformers, and Taft's handling of the tariff alienated all sides. While the crisis was building inside the Party, Roosevelt was touring Africa and Europe, to allow Taft to be his <b>own</b> <b>man.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{control and}} {{management}} of the Republican Party lay in the hands of Ohio Senator and Republican Party chairman Mark Hanna until McKinley's death. Roosevelt and Hanna frequently cooperated during Roosevelt's first term, but Hanna left open the possibility of a challenge to Roosevelt for the 1904 Republican nomination. Roosevelt and Ohio's other Senator, Joseph B. Foraker, forced Hanna's hand by calling for Ohio's state Republican convention to endorse Roosevelt for the 1904 nomination. Unwilling to break with the president, Hanna was forced to publicly endorse Roosevelt. Hanna and Pennsylvania Senator Matthew Quay both died in early 1904, and with the waning of Thomas Platt's power, Roosevelt faced little effective opposition for the 1904 nomination. In deference to Hanna's conservative loyalists, Roosevelt at first offered the party chairmanship to Cornelius Bliss, but he declined. Roosevelt turned to his <b>own</b> <b>man,</b> George B. Cortelyou of New York, the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor. To buttress his hold on the party's nomination, Roosevelt made it clear that anyone opposing Cortelyou would be considered to be opposing the President. The President secured his own nomination, but his preferred vice-presidential running mate, Robert R. Hitt, was not nominated. Senator Charles Warren Fairbanks of Indiana, a favorite of conservatives, gained the nomination.|$|E
25|$|This led to warfare between Kublai and Ariq BÃ¶ke, which {{resulted}} in the destruction of the Mongolian capital at Karakorum. In Shaanxi and Sichuan, MÃ¶ngke's army supported Ariq BÃ¶ke. Kublai dispatched Lian Xixian to Shaanxi and Sichuan, where they executed Ariq BÃ¶ke's civil administrator Liu Taiping and won over several wavering generals. To secure the southern front, Kublai attempted a diplomatic resolution and sent envoys to Hangzhou, but Jia broke his promise and arrested them. Kublai sent Abishqa as new khan to the Chagatai Khanate. Ariq BÃ¶ke captured Abishqa, two other princes, and 100 men, and he had his <b>own</b> <b>man,</b> Alghu, crowned khan of Chagatai's territory. In the first armed clash between Ariq BÃ¶ke and Kublai, Ariq BÃ¶ke lost and his commander Alamdar was killed at the battle. In revenge, Ariq BÃ¶ke had Abishqa executed. Kublai cut off supplies of food to Karakorum with the support of his cousin Kadan, son of Ãgedei Khan. Karakorum quickly fell to Kublai's large army, but following Kublai's departure it was temporarily re-taken by Ariq BÃ¶ke in 1261. Yizhou governor Li Tan revolted against Mongol rule in February 1262, and Kublai ordered his Chancellor Shi Tianze and Shi Shu to attack Li Tan. The two armies crushed Li Tan's revolt in just a few months and Li Tan was executed. These armies also executed Wang Wentong, Li Tan's father-in-law, who had been appointed the Chief Administrator of the Central Secretariat (Zhongshu Sheng) early in Kublai's reign and became one of Kublai's most trusted Han Chinese officials. The incident instilled in Kublai a distrust of ethnic Hans. After becoming emperor, Kublai banned granting the titles of and tithes to Han Chinese warlords.|$|E
