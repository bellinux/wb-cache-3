40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the genetic {{determinism}} of flowering and <b>maturity</b> <b>dates,</b> two traits highly affected by global climate change. Flowering and <b>maturity</b> <b>dates</b> were evaluated on five progenies from three Prunus species, peach, apricot and sweet cherry, during 3 - 8 years. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) detection was performed separately {{for each year}} and also by integrating data from all years together. High heritability estimates were obtained for flowering and <b>maturity</b> <b>dates.</b> Several QTLs for flowering and <b>maturity</b> <b>dates</b> were highly stable, detected each year of evaluation, suggesting {{that they were not}} affected by climatic variations. For flowering date, major QTLs were detected on linkage groups (LG) 4 for apricot and sweet cherry and on LG 6 for peach. QTLs were identified on LG 2, LG 3, LG 4 and LG 7 for the three species. For <b>maturity</b> <b>date,</b> a major QTL was detected on LG 4 in the three species. Using the peach genome sequence data, candidate genes underlying the major QTLs on LG 4 and LG 6 were investigated and key genes were identified. Our results provide a basis for the identification of genes involved in flowering and <b>maturity</b> <b>dates</b> {{that could be used to}} develop cultivar ideotypes adapted to future climatic conditions.

50|$|The term fixed {{maturity}} is applicable to {{any form of}} financial instrument under which the loan is due to be repaid on a fixed date. This includes fixed interest and variable rate loans or debt instruments, whatever they are called, and also other forms of security such as redeemable preference shares, provided their terms of issue specify a date. It is similar in meaning to 'redemption date'. However some such instruments may have no fixed <b>maturity</b> <b>date.</b> Loans with no <b>maturity</b> <b>date</b> continue indefinitely (unless repayment is agreed between the borrower and the lenders at some point) and may be known as 'perpetual stocks'. Some instruments {{have a range of}} possible <b>maturity</b> <b>dates,</b> and such stocks can usually be repaid at any time within that range, as chosen by the borrower.|$|R
