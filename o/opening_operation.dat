The ship's crew prepared and onloaded the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit with gear both pierside in Norfolk, and off the coast of North Carolina from Cherry Point and Camp Lejeune.

30|$|We {{perform the}} path <b>opening</b> <b>operation</b> {{to process the}} {{electric}} imaging image from the fracture–vug reservoir and compare the extraction result with that of multi-threshold segmentation (Fig.  15). We can distinguish the fracture and vug subimages extracted by multi-thresholding (Ge et al. 2015), according to the fracture roundness[*]>[*] 3.5 and the length–width ratio[*]>[*] 1.5 (Fig.  15 b, c). We determine the minimum value between the first peak and the second peak in Fig.  15 d as the threshold value of the path length L, and the extracted fractures and vugs are shown in Fig.  15 e, f based on the path <b>opening</b> <b>operation.</b> As shown in Fig.  15, both the path <b>opening</b> <b>operation</b> and the multi-threshold segmentation have achieved good segmentation results and verify {{the validity of the}} path opening algorithm for separating fractures and vugs.

40|$|AIM:To {{investigate}} the effect {{and safety of}} endoscopic common canaliculus <b>opening</b> <b>operation</b> for lacrimal sac anastomotic occlusion, in order to guide the clinical application. METHODS:Retrospective clinical study. Sixty-six patients(70 eyes) with lacrimal sac anastomotic occlusion were selected as the research subjects. All patients were treated by endoscopic common canaliculus <b>opening</b> <b>operation.</b> The post-operation follow-up lasted for 3 ～ 24 mo. Subjective feelings of patients were recorded through the collection of clinical data, out-patient follow-up and telephone follow-up. The operation effect and complications were observed, {{as well as the}} effect of treatment on complications. Meanwhile, the data was analyzed for evaluating the clinical efficacy of endoscopic common canaliculus <b>opening</b> <b>operation.</b> RESULTS:Epiphora was disappeared or obviously improved in 68 eyes(97 %), with lacrimal irrigating fluently and no obstacle. The post-operative complications included: 51 eyes(73 %) with foreign body sensation in inner canthus, 22 eyes(31 %) with foreign body sensation in the nose occasionally, 4 eyes(6 %) with granulation tissue proliferation at the opening of common canaliculus, 16 eyes(23 %) with localized congestion of the bulbar conjunctiva, and 3 eyes(4 %) with lacrimal drainage tube out. CONCLUSION: Endoscopic common canaliculus <b>opening</b> <b>operation</b> can treat the lacrimal sac anastomotic occlusion. This operation is characterized by high success rate, less complications, safe and efficient, and it is worth clinical promotion...|$|E

The minimum value between two peaks in the frequency distribution of the maximum path length l[x] for all pixels corresponds to the threshold value of the path length L for each geological structure along the borehole. To identify these different structures, we perform the path <b>opening</b> <b>operation</b> to the electric imaging images by their appropriate threshold values L.|$|E
30|$|We use {{a spatial}} {{filtering}} and a morphological processing for noise reduction. When the noise reduction method {{is applied to}} the motion image, real motion can be shown clearly. A 5 × 5 aperture median filter is used for spatial filtering. The median filter replaces the pixel value with the median value of the sub-image with aperture [23]. This median filter provides excellent salt and pepper noise reduction with considerably less blurring. As the noise pattern of the motion image is very similar to salt and pepper noise, the median filter is very effective. We also use morphological processing for noise reduction. We use the <b>opening</b> <b>operation</b> which consists of erosion followed by dilation [23]. The basic effect of the <b>opening</b> <b>operation</b> is to reduce the outer shape of the object by erosion and to expand the outers. Generally, this operation smooths the outers, splits the narrow region, and removes the thin perimeter. Thus, the <b>opening</b> <b>operation</b> removes the randomly generated noise and smooths the original image. The erosion operation slips off the object or particles layer, reducing irrelevant pixels and small particles from the image. The dilation operation does the inverse of the erosion operation. It attaches layers to the object or particles, and it can return the eroded objects or particles to their original size. These operations are highly effective for the depth image noise reduction.|$|E

The length of road edge segments is calculated; and if length of edge segment is less than given threshold value, then that edge segment is removed.

40|$|Several literatures {{presented}} automated {{systems for}} detecting or classifying sewer pipe defects based on morphological features of pipe defects. In those automated systems, however, the morphologies of the darker center or some uncertain objects on CCTV images are also segmented and become noises while morphology-based pipe defect segmentation is implemented. In this paper, the morphology-based pipe defect segmentation is proposed and discussed {{to be an}} improved approach for automated diagnosis of pipe defects on CCTV images. The segmentation of pipe defect morphologies is first to implement an <b>opening</b> <b>operation</b> for gray-level CCTV images to distinguish pipe defects. Then, Otsu's technique is used to segment pipe defects by determining the optimal thresholds for gray-level CCTV images of <b>opening</b> <b>operation.</b> Based on the segmentation results of CCTV images, the ideal morphologies of four typical pipe defects are defined. If the segmented CCTV images match the definition of those ideal morphologies, the pipe defects on those CCTV images can be successfully identified by a radial basis network (RBN) based diagnostic system. As for the rest CCTV images failing to match the ideal morphologies, the failure causes was discussed so to suggest a regulation for imaging conditions, such as camera pose and light source, {{in order to obtain}} CCTV images for successful segmentation.
