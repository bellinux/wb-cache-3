50|$|Some global {{variables}} (e.g. {{arrays of}} string literals, virtual function tables) {{are expected to}} contain an address of an object in data section resp. in code section of the dynamic library; therefore, the stored address in the global variable needs to be updated to reflect the address where the DLL was loaded to. The dynamic loader calculates the address referred to by a global variable and stores the value in such global variable; this triggers copy-on-write of a memory page containing such global variable. Pages with code and pages with global variables that do not contain pointers to code or global data remain shared between processes.

The nodes in the tree are generated recursively in this manner until they represent one single element in the underlying array.|$|E
