5|$|Archaeal lipid tails {{differ from}} those of <b>other</b> <b>organisms</b> in that they are based upon long isoprenoid chains with {{multiple}} side-branches, sometimes with cyclopropane or cyclohexane rings. By contrast, the fatty acids in the membranes of <b>other</b> <b>organisms</b> have straight chains without side branches or rings. Although isoprenoids {{play an important role in}} the biochemistry of many organisms, only the archaea use them to make phospholipids. These branched chains may help prevent archaeal membranes from leaking at high temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Underwater {{camouflage}} is the set {{of methods}} of achieving crypsis—avoidance of observation—that allows otherwise visible aquatic organisms to remain unnoticed by <b>other</b> <b>organisms</b> such as predators or prey.|$|E
5|$|Although Nepenthes rajah is {{most famous}} for {{trapping}} and digesting animals, its pitchers are also host {{to a large}} number of <b>other</b> <b>organisms,</b> which are thought to form a mutually beneficial (symbiotic) association with the plant. Many of these animals are so specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else, and are referred to as nepenthebionts. N. rajah has two such mosquito taxa named after it: Culex rajah and Toxorhynchites rajah.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{control is}} a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects, mites, weeds and plant diseases using <b>other</b> <b>organisms.</b> It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory, or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. It {{can be an important}} component of integrated pest management (IPM) programs.|$|E
50|$|Commensalism {{is a type}} of {{relationship}} among organisms in which one organism benefits while the <b>other</b> <b>organism</b> is neither benefited nor harmed. The organism that benefited is called the commensal while the <b>other</b> <b>organism</b> that is neither benefited nor harmed is called the host. For example, an epiphytic orchid attached to the tree for support benefits the orchid but neither harms nor benefits the tree.The opposite of commensalism is amensalism, an interspecific relationship in which a product of one organism has a negative effect on another organism.|$|R
50|$|This {{is where}} one {{organism}} hunts and eats the <b>other</b> <b>organism.</b> The organism hunting {{is called the}} predator, while the organism being hunted is called the prey. Energy received from the Sun is transferred from animals when the prey is eaten by the predator. The predator now has its prey's energy.|$|R
50|$|Available {{information}} posits {{the existence}} of just one predator: the starfish Luidia varia, observed in two cases. To date {{there is no evidence}} to suggest any fish or <b>other</b> <b>organism</b> preying on A. mollis.|$|R
5|$|Caprella mutica inhabit shallow {{protected}} marine {{bodies of}} water. They {{can often be}} found in dense colonies attached to submerged artificial structures, marine macroalgae, and <b>other</b> <b>organisms.</b> They are primarily omnivorous detritivores, but can adapt to other feeding methods depending on food availability. They are preyed upon by fish, crabs, and several other predators.|$|E
5|$|Coral reefs form {{some of the}} world's most {{productive}} ecosystems. Common coral reef cnidarians include both Anthozoans (hard corals, octocorals, anemones) and Hydrozoans (fire corals, lace corals). The endosymbiotic algae of many cnidarian species are very effective primary producers, in other words converters of inorganic chemicals into organic ones that <b>other</b> <b>organisms</b> can use, and their coral hosts use these organic chemicals very efficiently. In addition, reefs provide complex and varied habitats that support {{a wide range of}} <b>other</b> <b>organisms.</b> Fringing reefs just below low-tide level also have a mutually beneficial relationship with mangrove forests at high-tide level and sea grass meadows in between: the reefs protect the mangroves and seagrass from strong currents and waves that would damage them or erode the sediments in which they are rooted, while the mangroves and seagrass protect the coral from large influxes of silt, fresh water and pollutants. This additional level of variety in the environment is beneficial to many types of coral reef animals, which for example may feed in the sea grass and use the reefs for protection or breeding.|$|E
5|$|Decline in age, size during sexual {{maturity}} in {{great northern tilefish}} population is occurring throughout the continental shelf. In the mid-Atlantic Bight, smaller sizes and younger ages at maturity were observed in 2008, compared to the survey data from the 1980s where recorded measurements showed a larger population. The recent estimates of age and size at maturity in the southern U.S. waters were smaller than those previously reported in the late 1980s. There were also very few juvenile tilefish seen in tilefish population surveys in the southern U.S. waters in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Declines in population could negatively affect <b>other</b> <b>organisms</b> in their surrounding environment {{due to the fact}} that without tilefish, the burrows underneath the continental shelf will disappear, therefore putting an end to the symbiotic relationship with <b>other</b> <b>organisms</b> that use the tunnels as shelter.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{apparent}} simplicity, {{bacteria can}} form complex associations with <b>other</b> <b>organisms.</b> These symbiotic associations {{can be divided}} into parasitism, mutualism and commensalism. Due to their small size, commensal bacteria are ubiquitous and grow on animals and plants exactly as they will grow on any other surface. However, their growth can be increased by warmth and sweat, and large populations of these organisms in humans are the cause of body odour.|$|E
5|$|Each {{species of}} {{pathogen}} has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human hosts. Some organisms, such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus, can cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death. Yet these organisms are {{also part of}} the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing any disease at all. <b>Other</b> <b>organisms</b> invariably cause disease in humans, such as the Rickettsia, which are obligate intracellular parasites able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of <b>other</b> <b>organisms.</b> One species of Rickettsia causes typhus, while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Chlamydia, another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease. Finally, some species, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Mycobacterium avium, are opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis.|$|E
5|$|Ecology is {{the study}} of the {{distribution}} and abundance of living organisms, the interaction between them and their environment. An organism shares an environment that includes <b>other</b> <b>organisms</b> and biotic factors as well as local abiotic factors (non-living) such as climate and ecology. One reason that biological systems can be difficult to study is that so many different interactions with <b>other</b> <b>organisms</b> and the environment are possible, even on small scales. A microscopic bacterium responding to a local sugar gradient is responding to its environment as much as a lion searching for food in the African savanna. For any species, behaviors can be co-operative, competitive, parasitic, or symbiotic. Matters become more complex when two or more species interact in an ecosystem.|$|E
50|$|Transfer {{of genes}} make it {{possible}} for horizontal transfer of genes from one organism to another. Thus plants can receive genes from humans or algae or any <b>other</b> <b>organism.</b> This provides limitless opportunity in breeding crop plants.|$|R

Some of the sponges they eat, such as Aaptos aaptos, Chondrilla nucula, Tethya actinia, Spheciospongia vesparium, and Suberites domuncula, are highly (often lethally) toxic to <b>other</b> <b>organisms.</b> In addition, hawksbills choose sponge species with {{significant numbers of}} siliceous spicules, such as Ancorina, Geodia (G. gibberosa), Ecionemia, and Placospongia.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{ecosystems}} and environments {{are necessary to}} the survival of humans and <b>other</b> <b>organisms.</b> Ways of reducing negative human impact are environmentally-friendly chemical engineering, environmental resources management and environmental protection. Information is gained from green chemistry, earth science, environmental science and conservation biology. Ecological economics studies the fields of academic research that aim to address human economies and natural ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{ecosystems}} provide vital {{goods and}} services to humans and <b>other</b> <b>organisms.</b> There are two major ways of reducing negative human impact and enhancing ecosystem services and {{the first of these}} is environmental management.
