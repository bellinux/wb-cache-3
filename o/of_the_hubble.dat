This added component gives cosmologists a chance to measure the masses of objects independent of the mass to light ratio (the ratio of a galaxy's mass in solar masses to its brightness in solar luminosities), an important tool for measuring dark matter.|$|E

5|$|Neptune is {{not visible}} to the unaided eye {{and is the only}} planet in the Solar System found by {{mathematical}} prediction rather than by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position predicted by Urbain Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining known 13 moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989. The advent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed observations from afar.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-resolution}} spectra {{and images}} {{provided by the}} HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence of black holes in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would {{be found at the}} centers of some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s identified a number of good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies. The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related. The legacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the mirror flaw on {{scientific}} observations depended on the particular observation—the core of the aberrated PSF was sharp enough to permit high-resolution observations of bright objects, and spectroscopy of point sources was only affected through a sensitivity loss. However, the loss of light to the large, out of focus halo severely reduced {{the usefulness of the}} telescope for faint objects or high-contrast imaging. This meant that nearly all of the cosmological programs were essentially impossible, since they required observation of exceptionally faint objects. NASA and the telescope became the butt of many jokes, and the project was popularly regarded as a white elephant. For instance, in the 1991 comedy , Hubble was pictured with the Lusitania, the Hindenburg, and the Edsel. Nonetheless, during the first three years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> mission, before the optical corrections, the telescope still carried out a large number of productive observations of less demanding targets. The error was well characterized and stable, enabling astronomers to partially compensate for the defective mirror by using sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution.|$|E

40|$|A {{possible}} explanation <b>of</b> why <b>the</b> advanced solutions <b>of</b> Maxwell's equations are not observed in nature is {{by way of}} absorption by an opaque universe. As Davies has shown, the ever expanding, general relativistic cosmological models fail to provide the needed absorption. The absorption mechanism calling for an interplay between local physics and cosmology, is usually developed adopting the strong equivalence principle, SEP, which precludes such interplay. It is shown that complete absorption of electromagnetic radiation by ionized intergalactic plasma is obtained provided a violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SEP, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hubble's</b> constant, is allowed to occur. <b>The</b> same degree <b>of</b> violation was previously found to be compatible with {{a large body of}} observational data...|$|R
5|$|Water megamasers {{may be used}} {{to provide}} {{accurate}} distance determinations to distant galaxies. Assuming a Keplerian orbit, measuring the centripetal acceleration and velocity of water maser spots yields the physical diameter subtended by the maser spots. By then comparing the physical radius to the angular diameter measured on the sky, the distance to the maser may be determined. This method is effective with water megamasers because they occur in a small region around an AGN, and have narrow linewidths. This method of measuring distances is being used to provide an independent measure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> constant that does not rely upon use of standard candles. The method is limited, however, by the small number of water megamasers known at distances within the Hubble flow. This distance measurement also provides a measurement of the mass of the central object, which in this case is a supermassive black hole. Black hole mass measurements using water megamasers is the most accurate method of mass determination for black holes in galaxies other than the Milky Way. The black hole masses that are measured are consistent with the M-sigma relation, an empirical correlation between stellar velocity dispersion in galactic bulges and the mass of the central supermassive black hole.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} <b>the</b> "cold" <b>Hubble</b> flow {{observed}} for galaxies around the Milky Way {{does not represent}} a problem in cosmology but {{is due to the}} particular geometry and dynamics of our local wall. <b>The</b> behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> perturbed <b>Hubble</b> flow around <b>the</b> Milky Way is <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> two main factors: at small scales (R 1 Mpc) the out flow reflects <b>the</b> expansion <b>of</b> our local wall which "cools down" the peculiar velocities.
