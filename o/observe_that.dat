5|$|In {{view of the}} above, <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> for SQL's WHERE clause a {{tautology}} {{similar to}} the law of excluded middle can be written. Assuming the IS UNKNOWN operator is present, p OR (NOT p) OR (p IS UNKNOWN) is true for every predicate p. Among logicians, this is called law of excluded fourth.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mathematician}} {{to discover}} the existence of curves of constant width, and to <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> the Reuleaux triangle has constant width, may have been Leonhard Euler. In a paper that he presented in 1771 and published in 1781 entitled De curvis triangularibus, Euler studied curvilinear triangles {{as well as the}} curves of constant width, which he called orbiforms.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{resampled}} {{convolution method}} that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve-shortening flow, they call their method the resampled curvature scale space. They <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> this scale space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given shape, and assert that it uniquely determines {{the shape and}} is robust against small variations in the shape. They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes, and find that the resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive, more robust against nonuniform noise, and less strongly influenced by small-scale shape differences.|$|E

50|$|William McDougall {{disagreed}} with Shand's view, <b>observing</b> <b>that</b> Shand himself recognized that sorrow was itself derived from simpler elements. To support this argument, he <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> grief, at a loss, {{is a form}} of sorrow where there is no impulse to repair injury, and that therefore there are identifiable subcomponents of sorrow. He also <b>observes</b> <b>that</b> although {{there is an element of}} emotional pain in sorrow, there is no such element in pity, thus pity is not a compound made from sorrow as a simpler component.|$|R

5|$|Šišić {{pursued the}} helicopters, firing {{aircraft}} gun {{in front of}} the helicopters, but his aircraft was not armed with tracer ammunition and the helicopter pilots were not able to <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> they were fired upon. Flying at a speed of , he switched to missiles and registered that the missile seekers had acquired the targets. Šišić fired two infrared homing R-60 missiles. One of the missiles flew between the two helicopters, while the other struck the engine of the lead helicopter. The helicopter was shot down near the village of Podrute, located in an area administered by the city of Novi Marof, north of Zagreb. The second helicopter had to crash-land to evade the attack.|$|E

To illustrate {{the diversity of}} biblical interpretations, William Yarchin pictures a shelf full of religious books saying different things, but all claiming to be faithful interpretations of the Bible. Bernard Ramm <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> such diverse interpretations underlie the “doctrinal variations in Christendom.” A mid-19th century book on biblical interpretation <b>observed</b> <b>that</b> even those who believe the Bible to be “the word of God” hold “the most discordant views” about fundamental doctrines.” ...|$|R

25|$|The Grothendieck group. In K-theory, {{the point}} of {{departure}} is to <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> the category of vector bundles on a topological space has a commutative monoid structure under direct sum. One may make an abelian group out of this monoid, the Grothendieck group, by formally adding an additive inverse for each bundle (or equivalence class). Alternatively one can <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> the functor that for each group takes the underlying monoid (ignoring inverses) has a left adjoint. This is a once-for-all construction, {{in line with the}} third section discussion above. That is, one can imitate the construction of negative numbers; but there is the other option of an existence theorem. For the case of finitary algebraic structures, the existence by itself can be referred to universal algebra, or model theory; naturally there is also a proof adapted to category theory, too.|$|E
