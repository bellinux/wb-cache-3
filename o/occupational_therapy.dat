5|$|Dorset House had {{space for}} 800 {{patients}} in residence during the 1930s, moving to Bromsgrove during World War II. The building was damaged during the war, so in 1946, the School of <b>Occupational</b> <b>Therapy</b> moved to Oxford, whilst the patients moved to Clevedon. To ensure costs were kept {{down for the}} patients, Casson subsidised their treatment from her own funds. She began to release control of the projects in 1948, first by passing the school to a nonprofit company with her as vice-president and remaining as medical director. Then, in 1949, Casson created the Elizabeth Casson Trust which focused on <b>occupational</b> <b>therapy</b> treatment and education, {{with the majority of}} funds going to Dorset House school. In 1992, the school became part of Oxford Brookes University.|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} <b>occupational</b> <b>therapy’s</b> {{pursuit of}} social concerns through practice with marginalised groups or engaging with diversity. In {{this article we}} understand the term marginalisation as referring {{to people who are}} socially excluded {{from the rest of the}} society in which they live because of some economic, cultural, or social difference. We take the perspective that the experiences of marginalised people offer one means of assessing public health and social cohesion. We also explore the profession’s recent literature on social transformation. <b>Occupational</b> <b>therapy’s</b> narrow demographic profile and dominance of a Northern discourse are critically discussed in terms of engagement with how the problems of marginalisation, such as health inequality and poverty, impact on occupation. We address some of the problems which arise through professional and organisational power when working with marginalised people. The article concludes with an overview of the complexity of challenges in developing actions to meet diverse needs from a profession that is still growing...|$|R

40|$|In adolescence, the {{prevalence}} of mental disorders doubles compared to childhood {{and the need for}} interventions to reduce psychological symptoms increases. Most evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions are focused on single conditions, but in clinical practice most patients suffer from psychiatric comorbidity. However, research on effective treatment interventions for adolescents in a naturalistic setting is scarce. The aim of this three-month follow-up study was to investigate subjective outcomes of psychotherapeutic interventions in a naturalistic setting among adolescent psychiatric outpatients. The intention was to also find out if verbally performed psychotherapies were more effective than art and <b>occupational</b> <b>therapies</b> in symptom reduction. Further, to investigate whether the frequency of intervention or the severity of self-reported depressive symptoms were related to treatment effect. This study was conducted at the Helsinki University Central Hospital, Department of Adolescent Psychiatry. The study is part of an ongoing longitudinal study focusing on the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic interventions, started in February 2012. The sample comprised 58 adolescents, {{with a mean age of}} 14. 2 years, referred to psychotherapy or to art and <b>occupational</b> <b>therapies.</b> The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) and the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome-Measure (CORE-OM) were used as self-assessments both at baseline and the follow-up. The adolescents experienced symptom reduction during the first months of psychotherapeutic treatment. Symptom reduction was related to the frequency, but not to the form, of psychotherapeutic intervention. The life functioning of adolescents with severe depression improved more than those with only mild or moderate depression. In conclusion, psychotherapeutic interventions are effective in reducing the subjective symptoms of clinically referred adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Art and <b>occupational</b> <b>therapies</b> are as effective as psychotherapies in reducing symptoms. The frequency of intervention, as well as the level of depression prior to the intervention, seems to modify the outcome...|$|R
