5|$|A {{national}} recession greatly {{affected the}} city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma {{heavily dependent on}} oil suffered the freefall in gas prices due to a glut, and a mass exodus of oil industries. Tulsa, heavily dependent on the oil industry, was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> hit cities {{by the fall of}} oil prices. By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered, but leaders worked to expand into sectors unrelated to oil and energy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} {{underwater}} scene, {{most of which}} was shot at the water tank at Universal, Lawless had to be seat-belted into a car {{that was supposed to}} be submerged thirteen feet. In actuality, the water tank was four feet deep. Lawless, being six feet tall, had to kneel and breathe into a hookah while filming the scene. For the special effects team, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> parts of the episode was to hide the fact that Lawless was wearing a swimming suit.|$|E
40|$|Abstract A {{systematic}} {{study was}} conducted to investigate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>hard</b> segment molecular weight on concentrated solution and bulk properties of thermoplastic ether based polyurethanes (TPUs). The molar feed was used to determine <b>the</b> molecular weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> segment. Then <b>the</b> weight fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> segment is determined by calculating <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> <b>the</b> molecular weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> segment to <b>the</b> number average molecular weight <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TPU determined by GPC. Similar to <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> dilute solution properties, it was found that thermal and mechanical properties in the bulk were significantly affected at low weight fractions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> segment. <b>The</b> critical weight fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hard</b> segment was found at about 0. 4. Above critical weight fraction of hard segment there is a diminishing effect on the thermal properties and dynamical / mechanical properties in bulk...|$|R

5|$|Kijak {{revealed}} that upon thinking of Lynch's use of doppelgängers he {{was reminded of}} an interview where Yoshiki said he has two personalities, his public persona and a man wounded by the tragedies in his life. He made this the subtext of the film to have something deeper than the average rockumentary. He said one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> aspects was editorial, trying to balance all the characters, albums and drama with Yoshiki's life and work.|$|E
5|$|Le Carrefour de l'Arbre (or Pavé de Luchin) is {{the last}} section of pavé <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> level of difficulty, five stars. The {{crossroads}} (carrefour) is on open land between Gruson and Camphin-en-Pévèle. The route departs westward from Camphin-en-Pévèle along the rue de Cysoing towards Camphin de l'Arbre. The first half {{is a series of}} corners, then along irregular pavé towards Luchin. The second half finishes at the Café de l'Arbre restaurant and has more even pavé. This 2.1km sector has often proved decisive due to its proximity to Roubaix (15km) and cumulative difficulty.|$|E
5|$|Most notable part of Ninja Gaiden, which {{certainly}} made it famous, was its unforgiving, challenging difficulty, especially with very steep platforms, enemies that respawn upon dying {{unless they are}} close enough, aerial enemies and complicated platforming sections, all combined, make Ninja Gaiden one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> games on the NES, and its difficulty setting earned it both praise and criticism.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} team {{struggled in}} devising gameplay features {{that would be}} enjoyed by the fans of the series. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> tasks chief director Kiyoshi Mizuki was assigned {{to do was to}} attract people who had no prior experience with the series; he decided to make the gameplay as simple as possible. Producer Shigeru Miyamoto presented the staff with a variety of opinions which they in turn would have to incorporate into the game the best way possible. Miyamoto let the team decide which graphics they wanted to use without restrictions.|$|E
5|$|A {{veteran of}} World War I, Johnson {{did not begin}} playing {{competitive}} hockey until {{he was in his}} 20s and was nearly 30 when he first broke into the NHL. Regarded as one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> bodycheckers to ever play the game, he was a fan favourite and went on to play 436 games with the Rangers and Americans before spending his final seasons in the minor leagues as a player, coach and official. Johnson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958, and {{is also a member of}} the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum and the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the cases}} of most other {{refractory}} metals, the hardest known compounds of tantalum are its stable nitrides and carbides. Tantalum carbide, TaC, like the more commonly used tungsten carbide, is a very hard ceramic that is used in cutting tools. Tantalum(III) nitride is used as a thin film insulator in some microelectronic fabrication processes. Chemists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States have developed a tantalum carbide-graphite composite material that is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> materials ever synthesized. Korean researchers have developed an amorphous tantalum-tungsten-copper alloy that is more flexible and two to three times stronger than commonly used steel alloys. There are two tantalum aluminides, TaAl3 and Ta3Al. These are stable, refractory, and reflective, and they have been proposed as coatings for use in infrared wave mirrors.|$|E

5|$|Giordano {{was named}} the 19th captain in Flames history on September 20, 2013, as he succeeded Jarome Iginla, who was traded late in the 2012–13 season. Giordano was praised by his {{teammates}} and coaches staff for both his long tenure with the franchise and for his playing style: Giordano played in all situations for the Flames, was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> workers on the team and was willing to sacrifice himself to block a shot or defend his teammates. Head coach Bob Hartley praised Giordano's influence on his teammates as the rebuilding Flames team established an identity as a squad which was noted across the league for its work ethic.|$|E
5|$|South of the wintry {{precipitation}} zone, {{severe weather}} erupted across the Gulf States, where a tornado was reported on February 12 in the New Orleans area killing {{one person and}} injuring a dozen in the Pontchartrain Park neighborhood, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> hit areas by Hurricane Katrina due to the flood waters. The fatality occurred in a FEMA trailer that was hit by the EF2 tornado. In addition to significant structural damage to numerous buildings, including a dozen destroyed, 20,000 residents lost power across the metropolitan area. A separate destructive EF2, also struck the Carrollton and Hollygrove neighborhoods of New Orleans, {{as well as the}} town of Westwego, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|The author noted wryly {{that later}} in the series Allen's hair became similar to a Super Saiyan, a {{transformation}} in the Dragon Ball series where the character's hair becomes spiky. Hoshino said that early in D.Gray-mans publication, Allen was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> characters to draw. By the tenth volume, {{she said that the}} character was more difficult to draw than Yu Kanda. In the manga's first chapters, Allen's eyes have had different colors (such as red and light blue) due to a discussion between Hoshino and her editor; it was later decided to give him silver eyes. The series' title, D.Gray-man, is meant to have several meanings, (most referring to the state of Allen and the other main characters).|$|E

5|$|Of {{the other}} {{discovered}} allotropes, carbon nanofoam is a ferromagnetic allotrope discovered in 1997. It {{consists of a}} low-density cluster-assembly of carbon atoms strung together in a loose three-dimensional web, in which the atoms are bonded trigonally in six- and seven-membered rings. It is among the lightest known solids, with a density of about 2kg/m. Similarly, glassy carbon contains {{a high proportion of}} closed porosity, but contrary to normal graphite, the graphitic layers are not stacked like pages in a book, but have a more random arrangement. Linear acetylenic carbon has the chemical structure -(C:::C)-. Carbon in this modification is linear with sp orbital hybridization, and is a polymer with alternating single and triple bonds. This carbyne is of considerable interest to nanotechnology as its Young's modulus is forty times that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> known material– diamond.|$|E
5|$|On St. Croix, waves up to 15ft (4.5m) from Omar sank about 47 boats, {{leading to}} a large oil spill around the islands. About 400 ships broke lose from the docks, 200 of which lost their anchors. Omar {{produced}} upwards of 7in (177.8mm) of rain on the island within a 24‑hour span. Although St. Croix was brushed by the eyewall, sustained winds reached 53mph (85km/h) with gusts to 72mph (116km/h). Three people needed to be rescued when their ship struck a reef and began to sink. Most of the islands 55,000 residents were without power as over 100 utility poles were destroyed. Damages on the island were estimated at $700,000 with another $1million in clean-up costs. St. Thomas, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> hit islands, was left completely without power {{in the wake of}} the hurricane. All of the major intersections were shut down as traffic lights were either on the ground or without power. Damages on the island totaled to $5.3million.|$|E
5|$|Prior to landfall, twelve provinces, {{including}} some in Luzon, {{were placed on}} typhoon alert. Upon moving through the central Philippines, Typhoon Lee affected {{some of the same}} areas devastated by Typhoon Irma earlier that month, which was considered the strongest storm to affect the island since 1970. Lee knocked out communications and left many coconut-producing areas isolated. Railway services to and from Manila was suspended. Even though nine domestic flights were canceled, the Manila International Airport remained open throughout the passage of the typhoon. Across Manila, some flooding was reported and high winds tore off some Christmas decorations in hotels along the bay. The Sorsogon Province was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> hit areas by the typhoon; 20casualties happened there because of flooding. In the coastal region of Legaspi, home to a large volcano, 150houses were demolished due to storm surge, 25 of which were swept out at sea. Telephone lines were also cut off for four days in the city. Storm surge was also noted in coastal towns in the Sorsogon, Masbate, and Albay provinces. In the latter, three villages were damaged. Just south of the capital city of Manila, in the coastal town of Calapan on Mindoro Island, 5,600 houses were damaged, and 20,000persons or 85% of the town's residents were left without a home. Two fatalities were reported in the city. In the fishing village of San Fernando on Masbate Island, 50thatched huts were flattened. Elsewhere, four people were killed and three others injured in Naujan, where 86 homes were either damaged or destroyed.|$|E

5|$|In Pennsylvania, washed-out {{rail lines}} {{prevented}} operation along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad for several weeks, and lines reopened after about two months. The expense of reopening, {{and the loss}} of being closed, led to the railroad merging with the Erie Railroad to become the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960. One stranded train along the line prompted a helicopter to rescue 235people. Flooding along the Lehigh River destroyed 15industrial plants, which left more than 15,000people near Allentown, Pennsylvania without work temporarily. The mayor of Scranton {{declared a state of emergency}} due to the floods, ordering all businesses to close. United States Army soldiers provided water to residents after the town lost its water supply. Elsewhere, the Pennsylvania National Guard was on duty on streets in damaged towns, including 50 to prevent looting in Upper Black Eddy, which was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hardest</b> hit towns. Helicopters assisted in discovering bodies at Camp Davis, where many deaths occurred during the storm. Statewide, thousands of people were left homeless. In Stroudsburg, there was a food shortage, and officials enacted a curfew, after reports of looting. In the same city, water was shipped in milk cartons to the flood victims, which later inspired a Federal Civil Defense Administration proposal to use water packaged in milk containers in the event of a nuclear attack. The state government implemented a tax on cigarettes to help pay for storm damage, which lasted for about two years; this was partially due to a lack of significant funding from the federal government. Pennsylvania also enacted an increase in the gasoline tax that was later made permanent to pay for the Interstate Highway System. The two taxes, each an increase of 1penny, totaled $71million, a part of which was set aside for future disasters. The experience of the storm's aftermath provided the basis for the aftermath for Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In New Jersey, Governor Robert B. Meyner declared the floods as at the time the state's worst natural disaster.|$|E
