25|$|The diet of wildcats in Great Britain varies geographically; {{in eastern}} Scotland, {{lagomorphs}} make up 70% of their diet, {{while in the}} west, 47% consists of small rodents. In Western Europe, the wildcat feeds on hamsters, brown rats, dormice, water voles, voles, and wood mice. From time to time, small carnivores (martens, polecats, stoats, and weasels) are preyed upon, {{as well as the}} fawns of red deer, roe deer, and chamois. In the Carpathians, the wildcat feeds primarily on yellow-necked mice, red-backed voles, and ground voles. European hares are also taken on occasion. In Transcarpathia, the wildcat's diet consists of mouse-like rodents, galliform birds, and squirrels. Wildcats in the Dnestr swamps feed on small voles, water voles, and birds, while those living in the Prut swamps primarily target water voles, brown rats, and muskrats. Birds taken by Prut wildcats include warblers, ferruginous ducks, coots, spotted crakes, and gadwalls. In Moldavia, the wildcat's winter diet consists primarily of rodents, while birds, fish, and crayfish are eaten in summer. Brown rats and water voles, as well as muskrats and waterfowl are the main sources of food for wildcats in the Kuban delta. Wildcats in the northern Caucasus feed on mouse-like rodents and edible dormice, as well as birds on rare occasions. On rare occasions, young chamois and roe deer, are also attacked. Wildcats on the Black Sea coast are thought to feed on small birds, shrews, and hares. On one occasion, the feathers of a white-tailed eagle and the skull <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> were found at a den site. In Transcaucasia, the wildcat's diet consists of gerbils, voles, birds, and reptiles in the summer, and birds, mouse-like rodents, and hares in winter. Turkmenian wildcats feed on great and red-tailed gerbils, Afghan voles, thin-toed ground squirrels, Tolai hares, small birds (particularly larks), lizards, beetles, and grasshoppers. Near Repetek, the wildcat is responsible for destroying over 50% of nests made by desert finches, streaked scrub warblers, red-tailed warblers, and turtledoves. In the Qarshi steppes of Uzbekistan, the wildcat's prey, in descending order of preference, includes great and red-tailed gerbils, jerboas, other rodents and passerine birds, reptiles, and insects. Wilcats in eastern Kyzyl Kum have similar prey preferences, with the addition of tolai hares, midday gerbils, five-toed jerboas, and steppe agamas. In Kyrgyzstan, the wildcat's primary prey varies from tolai hares near Issyk Kul, pheasants in the Chu and Talas valleys, and mouse-like rodents and gray partridges in the foothills. In Kazakhstan's lower Ili, the wildcat mainly targets rodents, muskrats, and Tamarisk gerbils. Occasionally, remains of young roe deer and wild boar are present in its faeces. After rodents, birds follow in importanance, along with reptiles, fish, insects, eggs, grass stalks and nuts (which probably enter the cat's stomach through pheasant crops). In west Africa, the wildcat feeds on rats, mice, gerbils, hares, small to medium-sized birds (up to francolins), and lizards. In southern Africa, where wildcats attain greater sizes than their western counterparts, antelope fawns and domestic stock, such as lambs and kids are occasionally targeted.|$|E

[...] He lived with his biological mother and two sisters until he was ten, before moving in with Wall; she officially took custody of Tidwell at the age of twelve.|$|E

2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Variety said, [...] "he flying {{action has}} a casual flip buoyancy, {{and the movie}} does get you rooting for Peter. The appeal of this {{particular}} Spider-Boy is all too basic: In his lunge for valor, he keeps falling, and he keeps getting up." [...] Mike Ryan of Uproxx praised the film's light tone and performances, writing: [...] "Spider-Man: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie to date. That does come with a caveat that Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man 2 are going for different things and both are great. But, tonally, I just love this incarnation of a Peter Parker who just loves being Spider-Man." [...] The New York Timess Manohla Dargis stated, [...] "Mr. Holland looks and sounds more like a teen than the actors who’ve previously suited up for this series, and he has fine support from a cast that includes Jacob Batalon as Peter’s best friend. Other good company includes Donald Glover, as a wrong-time, wrong-place criminal, and Martin Starr, who plays his teacher role with perfect deadpan timing." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "The best thing about Spider-Man: Homecoming is Spidey is still more <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> than a man. Even with his budding superpowers, {{he still has the}} impatience, the awkwardness, the passion, the uncertainty and sometimes the dangerous ambition of a teenager {{still trying to figure out}} this world." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a [...] "mixed" [...] review, praising the stunt work and calling Michael Keaton's performance as the Vulture [...] "one of the strongest, most sympathetic villains of the entire series," [...] but criticizing the direction by Jon Watts as [...] "unevenly orchestrated".|$|E
