40|$|The {{legislation}} on the Icelandic genetic database provides for an <b>opting-out</b> <b>system</b> {{for the collection}} of encoded medical information from individual medical records. From the beginning this has raised criticism, in Iceland itself and abroad. The Supreme Court has now decided that this approach of presumed consent is not unconstitutional per se, but {{that there are not}} sufficient safeguards to ensure that the information collected is not traceable to individuals. The decision of the court is of importance for the debate (at national and international level) on the legal and ethical aspects of population-based genetic databases. Furthermore, it is interesting because it recognizes the right of close relatives of a deceased person to oppose the collection and use of his or her medical data for genetic research, at least as long as these data may still be identifiabl...|$|E
40|$|Some {{countries}} have introduced the <b>opting-out</b> <b>system</b> of organ donation {{as a way}} of increasing the number of available organs for transplants. Public opinion is divided on this issue and so are medical recommendations. While some claim that opting-out is the only way forward to increase the harvesting of organs and transplants, others claim that the decision whether or not to donate the organs of a dead relative should be a voluntary decision taken by the next of kin. In this paper, five doctors who are directly involved in organ donation or transplantation in Malta were interviewed {{on the issue of the}} harvesting of organs. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed. The interviewees concur that since the rate of refusals is still low in Malta, the opt-in system which is currently in practice should be retained...|$|E
40|$|There are {{considerable}} {{differences in}} the number of organ donations between countries. It is assumed that <b>opting-out</b> <b>systems</b> have a significantly positive impact on the national organ donation rate. The aim of our study was to establish whether different consent systems explain the difference in organ donation rates between countries when taking into account the difference in relevant mortality rates. For this study, we compared data on donation and relevant mortality rates for 10 different countries as well as information on the existing consent systems. This international comparative study shows that there is a strong correlation between mortality rates and donation rates (Spearman's rho = 0. 81 (P < 0. 01). International comparative legal research has shown that the differences between decision systems are marginal. When the national organ donation rates are corrected for mortality rates, these findings are confirmed: the donor efficiency rate shows that <b>opting-out</b> <b>systems</b> do not automatically guarantee higher donation rates than opting-in system...|$|R
40|$|Organs {{available}} for transplantation are scarce and valuable medical resources and decisions {{about who is}} to receive them should not be made more difficult by complicated calculations of desert. Consideration of likely clinical outcome must always take priority when allocating such a precious resource otherwise {{there is a danger}} of wasting that resource. However, desert may be a relevant concern in decision-making where the clinical risk is identical between two or more potential recipients of organs. Unlikely as this scenario is, such a decision procedure makes clear the interdependence of organ recipient and organ donor and hints at potential disadvantages for those who are willing to accept but unwilling to donate organs (free-riders). A combined <b>opting-out</b> and preference <b>system</b> weakens many of the objections to <b>opting-out</b> <b>systems</b> and may make the decision to donate organs on behalf of their deceased relatives easier for families...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the current}} active HIV test policy, {{the effects of}} the former policy are still visible, i. e. a {{relatively}} low number of individuals that have ever been tested for HIV. [...] The number of HIV tests and knowledge of current HIV status has increased among visitors to the STI clinic in Amsterdam. [...] Nevertheless, anonymous HIV surveillance among visitors to the STI clinic shows that a considerable proportion of HIV-infected individuals (24 % of {{men who have sex with}} men (MSM) and 80 % of heterosexuals) are unaware of the infection. [...] A new opting-out strategy for HIV testing in STI clinics is recommended. [...] The opting-out strategy may also be applicable to other medical settings, especially those that treat target populations such as MSM, heterosexuals with STI-related symptoms, and persons originating from AIDS-endemic regions. [...] The <b>opting-out</b> <b>system</b> was initiated in the Amsterdam STI clinic in 2007 in order to further reduce the number of undiagnosed HIV infection...|$|E
40|$|ADInternational audienceGender gaps in {{employment}} and wages have decreased over the past decades, especially once we control for observable characteristics. However, women are still underrepresented in high paid jobs, and this is largely the result of lower promotion rates. Our study on French academic economists, whose promotion to senior positions occurs through a national contest, finds that women {{are not subject to}} discrimination during the promotion contests. Instead, female academics are between 30 and 40 % less likely than men to enter these contests. We also find that this application gap is not due to a higher cost of promotion for women nor to women having a different trade-off between wages and department prestige than men, which leaves the expectation of discrimination and a dislike for entering competitions as the sole possible explanations. Long-term public policy can aim at encouraging self-confidence in girls so as to eventually make women as competitive as men. In the short term, making the application gap public knowledge so as to change women’s expectations of discrimination or making candidatures automatic, substituting the opting-in by an <b>opting-out</b> <b>system,</b> could reduce the gender gap in promotion...|$|E
40|$|The {{debate on}} whether to {{introduce}} the <b>opting-out</b> <b>system</b> is complex and involves various ethical, philosophical, psychological and legal issues. Different answers are given to questions such as “Who owns {{the body of the}} dead person? Does the State own the body of the deceased person or does the body belong to the next of kin? Should the decision whether or not to donate the organs of a dead relative be taken by the State? How informed are people about opting-out? If persons are not aware of the system, would the organs still be taken even when relatives are against opting-out?” Because there is no consensus regarding these and other questions, some sections of society and groups may present resistance to introducing the system. On the other hand, doctors’ associations as well as other lobby groups argue that organs should not go to waste and agree with State intervention to retrieve more organs through the introduction of opting-out. The question asked by those in favour of opting-out is “How fair is it for thousands of people to keep on waiting for an organ transplant, when it is possible to reduce these numbers drastically by legislation?” This is the problem facing policy makers. Should the state try to encourage and facilitate a gradual change in public opinion towards opting-out or should legislation on presumed consent be introduced?peer-reviewe...|$|E
