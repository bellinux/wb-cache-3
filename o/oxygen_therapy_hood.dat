40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a new method for controlling and administering olfactory stimuli [...] -namely, the hood system. The hood system involves a stream of vaporized odor (at known concentrations) mixed with odorless air and pumped (at a constant flow rate) into an <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> <b>hood.</b> It is designed to be used with odorants in solution, such as essential oils, as the olfactory stimulus. The use of oxygen therapy hoods allows for the precise control of a constant concentration of odorized air over time, while allowing subjects to breathe normally. The hood system provides a natural administration of olfactory stimuli and the exact determination of the stimulus concentration. The use of this system will allow experimental conditions to be completely defined and results and replication studies to be accurately interpreted. The hood system is portable, cost effective, and constructed from readily available components. It is proposed that the hood system could be adopted to suit a wide range of olfactory research, particularly that in which the effects of chronic exposure to olfactory stimuli on cognition are examined...|$|E

The design was a systematic Cochrane review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of long-term <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> for COPD and main outcome measure was survival on home <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy.</b> Five RCTs were identified.

Data was collected on <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> prescription and administration. A hospital guideline on <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> was introduced and disseminated in 2015, following which data was collected again and compared to the 2011 data.

30|$|Introduction Acute {{respiratory}} failure {{is the leading}} cause of ICU admission of immunocompromised patients. In the early 2000 s, two randomized controlled trials suggested that as compared to standard <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy,</b> noninvasive ventilation could decrease mortality of immunocompromised patients admitted to ICU for acute {{respiratory failure}}. However, the benefits of noninvasive ventilation in immunocompetent patients with acute respiratory failure are still debated. High-flow <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> through a nasal cannula may offer an alternative in hypoxemic patients, and we recently found, in a randomized controlled trial including 310 patients with acute respiratory failure, that as compared to noninvasive ventilation, high-flow <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> decreased mortality. In our unit, high-flow <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> is increasingly used, gradually replacing noninvasive ventilation. Our objective was to compare outcomes of immunocompromised patients admitted to ICU for acute respiratory failure and treated with either high-flow <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> or noninvasive ventilation as first-line therapy.|$|R
30|$|Conclusion In immunocompromised {{patients}} {{admitted to}} ICU for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, {{as compared to}} standard <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> or noninvasive ventilation, high-flow <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> was associated with lower intubation and mortality rates and reduced duration of invasive mechanical ventilation.|$|R

40|$|Aim. This {{paper is}} a report of a study to {{describe}} patients 2 ̆ 7 and nurses 2 ̆ 7 perspectives on <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy.</b> Background.

Nurses frequently make clinical decisions about the selection and management of low-flow <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> devices. Better understanding of patients 2 ̆ 7 and nurses 2 ̆ 7 experiences of <b>oxygen</b> <b>therapy</b> could inform clinical decisions about oxygen administration using low-flow devices. Methods. Face-to-face interviews with {{a convenience sample of}} 37 adult patients (17 cardio-thoracic: 20 medical surgical) and 25 intensive care unit nurses were conducted from February 2007 to September 2007. Interviews were audio-taped, transcribed verbatim and then analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Findings. The patients identified three key factors that underpinned their compliance with oxygen therapy: (i) device comfort; (ii) ability to maintain activities of daily living; and (iii) therapeutic effect.
