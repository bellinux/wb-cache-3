500|$|Before filming began, Straczynski and the Wachowskis {{mapped out}} five seasons worth of stories for the series, {{including}} the series' final episode, similarly to what Straczynski had previously done on his Babylon 5 series. The actors cast were signed for five seasons. [...] "We pitched it as a five-year story. We've mapped out five seasons <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> our actor deals {{are being made}} for five seasons, five or six depending on the breaks", said Straczynski. The first season acts as the origin story for the characters. When asked how long is their story bible, Straczynski replied [...] "It's in our heads". However, Straczynski did compile a 30-page document detailing the key points of a hypothetical second season should the first season become a success.|$|E
500|$|In 2000, Schmirler {{worked as}} colour {{commentator}} for CBC during Canada's national junior curling championships. During her illness, Schmirler {{had been largely}} removed from the public eye. While in Moncton for the championships, Schmirler {{held a press conference}} to update her situation. In speaking publicly about her ordeal for the first time, Schmirler spared few details about what she had gone through, while also expressing her hope for the future: [...] "There were three goals I had coming out <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> and the first one was to look after my family. And the second one...because I curl so much, I've never taken a hot vacation, so I'm going to put my feet in the sand in a warm place. And the last one was to actually be here today, and I thank CBC, I thank Lawrence (Kimber), and Joan Mead." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 15 {{the session}} began at 6p.m. but Dylan simply {{sat in the}} studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and {{outlined}} {{the structure of the}} song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". Kenny Buttrey recalled, [...] "If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel... After about ten minutes <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five minutes ago. Where do we go from here?" [...] The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.|$|E

25|$|Madhyamaka {{states that}} impermanent {{collections}} of causes and conditions are designated by mere conceptual labels. This {{also applies to}} the principle of causality itself, since everything is dependently originated. If unaware <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> <b>things</b> may seem to arise as existents, remain for a time and then subsequently perish. In reality, dependently originated phenomena do not arise as having inherent existence in the first place. Thus both existence and nihilism are ruled out.|$|R
500|$|On January 31, 2007, Biden {{took his}} first steps into the presidential campaign, but his {{comments}} about other candidates overshadowed his entrance. Biden especially drew criticism in the popular press for his evaluation of Senator Barack Obama; Biden {{was quoted in the}} New York Observer as saying: [...] "I mean, you got the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy, ... I mean, that's a storybook, man." [...] The audio of the interview, posted on the Observers website, reportedly includes a significant pause after [...] "African-American" [...] which would drastically change the meaning of the statement. Biden sought to clear up the controversy by apologizing to Obama on the same day and repeated his regret on The Daily Show that same evening: [...] "Look, the other part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> that got me in trouble is using the word clean. I should have said fresh." [...] Some media observers labeled Biden's announcement a [...] "launch pad disaster." [...] Jesse Jackson telephoned Biden and reported afterward [...] "Senator Biden...assured me that he regrets that his remarks were misinterpreted. He was serious and contrite. To me, this was a gaffe, not a statement about his philosophy or ideology." ...|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the lack}} of success in NAACP's actions to ban the film, on April 17, 1915, NAACP {{secretary}} Mary Childs Nerney wrote to NAACP Executive Committee member George Packard: [...] "I am utterly disgusted with the situation in regard to The Birth of a Nation ... kindly remember that we have put six weeks of constant effort <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> and have gotten nowhere." ...|$|E

One <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>things</b> is coming back to Brazil". Therefore, his intentions were to come back to Fluminense, where he is still seen as an idol. However, Fluminense was not able to come to an agreement with Guangzhou Evergrande so Conca returned to China on 3 January 2013.|$|R

2500|$|I {{dropped the}} I-76 or the Imperial Japanese Navy Trans-Pacific Submarine {{down into the}} mouth of the Columbia River, dead duck. And it went down with a resounding furor.

2500|$|Speaking to USA Today in 2004, Frey said [...] "The whole {{project was}} bootlegged, {{there was no}} {{official}} approval <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing.</b> We {{had to do it}} on a shoestring." [...] Consequently, when Henry Ford II did approve the project, he put Frey in charge and told him he would be fired if the Mustang was not successful. Ultimately, the Mustang was a huge success, despite being engineered at one tenth the cost of the 1965 Ford Galaxie.|$|E

2500|$|On April 15, 2006, {{civil rights}} activist Jesse Jackson said that his {{non-profit}} Rainbow/Push Coalition organization {{would pay for the}} college tuition of the accuser, Mangum, whether she fabricated the story or not. Jackson said that she should never [...] "have to stoop that low to survive." [...] He continued that the [...] "...fantasy's as old as slave masters impregnating young slave girls [...] The character <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> is chilling [...] omething happened that everybody's ashamed of..." [...] Defense attorney Joe Cheshire found Jackson's comment about [...] "slave masters" [...] odd because the players did not ask for black strippers. [...] "There is no slave-master mentality here, and that's just another perfect example of [...] self-absorbed race pandering," [...] Cheshire stated.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin B. Gowen, the {{president}} of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, and of the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company and [...] "the wealthiest anthracite coal mine owner in the world", hired Allan Pinkerton's services to deal with the Mollies. Pinkerton selected James McParland (sometimes called McParlan), a native of County Armagh, to go undercover against the Mollies. Using the alias [...] "James McKenna", he made Shenandoah his headquarters and claimed to have become a trusted member of the organization. His assignment was to collect evidence of murder plots and intrigue, passing this information along to his Pinkerton manager. He also began working secretly with a Pinkerton agent assigned to the Coal and Iron Police for the purpose of coordinating the eventual arrest and prosecution of members of the Molly Maguires. Although there had been fifty [...] "inexplicable murders" [...] between 1863 and 1867 in Schuylkill County, progress in the investigations was slow. There was [...] "a lull in the entire area, broken only by minor shootings". McParland wrote: I am sick and tired <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing.</b> I seem to make no progress.|$|E
2500|$|Lisa Evans, an {{attorney}} for the environmental group Earthjustice (headquartered in Oakland, CA), spoke out against the government, accusing them of lax regulations on the issue. She also blamed the industry for ineffective safeguards, citing other similar cases. She stated that [...] "The saddest thing is this is entirely avoidable. These people in these communities don't have to be in harm's way. This is not some complicated problem like nuclear waste. This is something the utilities know how to do." [...] Thomas J. FitzGerald, the director of the environmental group Kentucky Resources Council and an expert on coal waste, told The New York Times that the ash should have been buried in lined landfills to prevent toxins leaching into the soil and groundwater (as recommended in a 2006 EPA report), and stated that [...] "I find it difficult to comprehend that the State of Tennessee would have approved that as a permanent disposal site." [...] Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen, on-site the week of the spill, acknowledged that the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, which regulates coal disposal, may have relied too much on TVA’s own inspections and engineering studies about the ash ponds and dredge cells.“Believe me, there will be a full-bore look at this to understand the causes <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> and to try to make sure it never happens again,” he said. Concern has also been expressed by environmental groups and local residents that no warnings were issued to residents living in the area about the potential dangers of the site. The site may be slated as a Superfund site, although no decision regarding this has yet been made. On December 27, 2008 the TVA issued a list of precautions to residents, but did not provide information about specific levels of toxic materials in the ash, although Stephen Smith of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and Chris Irwin of United Mountain Defense told The Tennessean newspaper that they believe the TVA knows what is in it, due to the TVA having tested it prior to the spill. The TVA released an inventory of the plant's byproducts on December 29, 2008; it included arsenic, lead, barium, chromium, and manganese. Because the pond contained decades worth of ash from coal of several different types, it is believed that the area of the spill may contain [...] "hot spots" [...] of higher toxicity.|$|E
