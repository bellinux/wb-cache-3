In effect {{it is the}} solid state analogy of a multigrid vacuum tube performing a very useful multigrid function. A new structure is developed for p-channel 10 ohm-cm. silicon substrate of (111) crystal orientation. This structure consists of an aluminum control gate G₁ buried in the pyrolytic SiO₂, or E-gun evaporation SiO₂, with thermal oxide for the control gate insulator. An <b>offset</b> <b>gate</b> G₂ produces another channel L₂ and causes a longer pinchoff region in the device. The drain breakdown can be maximized so as to approach bulk breakdown {{as the result of}} the redistribution of the surface field. The Miller feedback capacitance C[subscript]G 1 -D is very low, approaching values similar to those of the vacuum pentodes.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the behavior of the}} resistance of graphene at the n= 0 Landau Level in an intense magnetic field H. Employing a low-dissipation technique (with power P< 3 fW), we find that, at low temperature T, the resistance at the Dirac point R_ 0 (H) undergoes a 1000 -fold increase from ∼ 10 kΩ to 40 MΩ within a narrow interval of field. The abruptness of the increase suggests that a transition to an insulating, ordered state occurs at the critical field H_c. Results from 5 samples show that H_c depends systematically on the disorder, as measured by the <b>offset</b> <b>gate</b> voltage V_ 0. Samples with small V_ 0 display a smaller critical field H_c. Empirically, the steep increase in R_ 0 fits acccurately a Kosterlitz-Thouless-type correlation length over 3 decades. The curves of R_ 0 vs. T at fixed H approach the thermal-activation form with a gap Δ∼ 15 K as H→ H_c^-, consistent with a field-induced insulating state. Comment: 7 pages, 9 figures.

40|$|Abstract. An {{analysis}} of the efficiency of power-gating for clock storage elements (CSE) is presented. Two CSE topologies: the TGMS (Transmission Gate Master Slave) and the WPMS (Write Port Master Slave) are examined along with their respective circuits with sleep transistors. In this work, we study the benefits of adding sleep transistors coupled with regular clock-gating during inactive mode. We examine the energy savings for standard clock gated CSEs versus their power gated counterparts. This is done by studying how the leakage energy saved with power <b>gating</b> <b>offsets</b> the energy consumed by the extra transistors added to support it.

40|$|A {{study on}} the {{influence}} of phosphorus implanted source/drain features on the off-state performance of transistors fabricated in thin-film crystalline silicon at low temperature is presented. Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) thin film transistors (TFTs) were fabricated on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrates; both NFET and PFET devices in the same p-type layer. Lightly Doped Drain (LDD) features were implemented on NFETs, and a surface-halo source barrier (N-barrier) was implemented on PFETs, using a common implant step. A new mask set was designed with fine resolution of <b>gate</b> <b>offset</b> to investigate small changes in placement of the LDD/ N-barrier structures.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{fundamentally}} {{relevant to the}} development of a new enhanced Roller Track Gate (RTG) for the gravity type Self-unloading Bulk Carriers (SULS), called the Multi-functional Roller Track Gate (MRG). Self-unloading Bulk Carriers (SULS) are specialized types of dry bulk carrier vessels, principally because these ships discharge their cargoes without the assistance of external sources. In 1908, the first commercial vessel of these types started trading in the Great Lakes region of North America. Subsequent to the inception of SULS, the technology has developed mainly in the hull structure and onboard unloading systems. Due to the 1980 s GL shipping recession, SULS migrated internationally and are now trading worldwide. Eight gravity gates for SULS were investigated in detail prior to designing the MRG. These examinations of previous gates were primarily to address the inherent issues and develop a new gate that would correct the current problems, when discharging dry bulk cargo with the existing gravity gates. The newly designed gate is accompanied with special control system that improves the discharging operations of these type vessels. This gate resulted in being heavier when compared to the existing RTG. However, this study also addresses and mitigates the associated improvements in this new type gate that increases the ship’s lightweight with the possibility of increasing payload / deadweight. High tensile steel was introduced for the hull to compensate for the added gate weight. The steel weight reduction investigation resulted in greater weight than what was required for <b>offsetting</b> the <b>gate</b> weight. The additional weight savings allowed for greater cargo lift for the vessels examined. The economic case study confirmed that by replacing the present Roller Track Gate with the Multi-functional Roller Track Gate, the shipowners’ would benefit from improve discharging performance, less port turn around time and reduced manning cost.

Despite almost all of the First Division clubs utilising a first team manager, the committee would continue to run first team affairs. Had Brentford been relegated {{at the end of the}} previous season, the £557 loss on the season (approximately £63,000 in 2017) would have spelt the end of the club, but attendances had almost doubled at York Road and gate receipts of £1,244 were taken (£140,000 in 2017). Frustratingly, Brentford's promotion to the First Division had necessitated a trebling of the wage bill, which <b>offset</b> the increased <b>gate</b> receipts. To increase revenue, the club would also enter into the London League and Western League during the season and the squad was expanded to 26 professionals, which led to a 60% expansion of the wage bill.

40|$|Modern power DMOS {{transistors}} greatly {{benefit from}} the continuous advances of the technology, which yield devices with very low area-specific RDS,on figures of merit and therefore allow for significantly reduced active areas. However, in many applications, where the devices must dissipate high amounts of energy and thus are subjected to significant self-heating, the active area is not dictated by RDS,on requirements, but by the energy constraints. In this paper, a simple method of improving the energy capability and reliability of power DMOS transistors operating in pulsed conditions is proposed and experimentally verified. The method consists in redistributing the power density from the hotter to the cooler device regions, hence achieving a more homogeneous temperature distribution and a reduced peak temperature. To demonstrate the principle, a simple <b>gate</b> <b>offset</b> circuit is used to redistribute the current density to the cooler DMOS parts. No technology changes are needed for the implementation, only {{minor changes to the}} driver circuit are necessary, with a minimal impact on the additional required active area. Improvements in the energy capability from 9. 2 % up to 39 % have been measured. Furthermore, measurements have shown that the method remains effective also if the operating conditions change significantly.

40|$|Microcontroller based {{embedded}} systems have witnessed enormous growth in recent decades. Microcontrollers {{are the most}} versatile products found {{in most of the}} market segments and in several product families spanning from 4 -bit to 64 -bit processors. The application domain is such that for some applications only a little functionality is required; for instance, when used as a controller for a simple user interface. In other applications, the functionality demands are high, such as the demand for floating-point calculations and signal processing. Microcontrollers have to meet these demands, while being smaller in size and power efficient. Since memory occupies a large share of area in a microcontroller and contributes the most towards power consumption, the architecture has to be memory efficient. Particularly, for applications using a matrix of processors (as in multi-core architectures), each with its own program memory, the program memory and power efficiencies are a major design goal. The memory efficiency of the instruction set, which also implies power efficiency, is an important factor which needs {{to be taken into account}} in the design of microcontroller architectures. In this thesis, we propose a Memory and Power Efficient Architecture (MePoEfAr) for embedded microcontrollers. MePoEfAr is intended as an improvement of the class of architectures represented by the ATMEL AVR, Texas Instruments MSP 430 and the ARM Cortex-M 3 microcontrollers. These architectures were designed to be used as embedded controllers. They often have on-board SRAM for data storage and ROM/Flash for program storage. This property demands a memory-efficient architecture, because a small savings of the on-chip program memory area quickly <b>offsets</b> the <b>gates</b> required for extra processor functionality. In addition, due to power aspects, especially for hand-held devices, the clock frequencies used are not very high, so that the instruction decoding time is less critical. A source level profiler has been developed to get the statistics of various C language constructs for the representative programs used in embedded applications. These statistics were used in making various trade-offs to tune this architecture. An assembler and Interpretive simulator was developed to perform assembler level benchmarking for performance evaluation and comparison with three embedded architectures. Results show the improvement of MePoEfAr performance by 70 % and 17 % when compared to TIMSP 430 and ARMCoretex-M 3 microcontrollers, respectively. Furthermore, MePoEfAr outperforms Atmel AVR by a factor of 2. 32. Efficiency of MePoEfAr comes from its more orthogonal architecture, its memory efficient and rich instruction set, efficient support for immediate values and displacements, efficient instruction encoding with variable length instructions of 1 to 4 bytes. Moreover, availability of large number of registers, and the possibility of large number of operations on these registers add to the efficiency of the architecture.
