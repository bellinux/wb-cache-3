50|$|A keratometer, {{also known}} as a <b>ophthalmometer,</b> is a {{diagnostic}} instrument for measuring the curvature of the anterior surface of the cornea, particularly for assessing the extent and axis of astigmatism. It was invented by the German physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz in 1851, although an earlier model was developed in 1796 by Jesse Ramsden and Everard Home.|$|E
50|$|The corneal topograph {{owes its}} {{heritage}} to the Portuguese ophthalmologist Antonio Placido, who, in 1880, viewed a painted disk (Placido's disk) of alternating {{black and white}} rings reflected in the cornea. The rings showed as contour lines projected on the corneal tear film. Javal L., {{a pioneer in the}} field in the 1880s incorporated the rings in his <b>ophthalmometer</b> and mounted an eyepiece which magnified the image of the eye. He proposed that the image should be photographed or diagrammatically represented to allow analysis of the image.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was also}} a skilled {{technician}} and mathematician. While in Paris, he invented a keratometer with Dr. Louis Émile Javal that was to {{become known as the}} Javal-Schiøtz <b>ophthalmometer,</b> an optical instrument used to measure the curvature of the anterior corneal surface. He presented an early version of the instrument at the international congress of eye specialists in Milan (1880), and demonstrated the finished product at the international medical congress in London (1881). In 1905 Schiøtz invented the [...] "Schiøtz tonometer", which is an indentation tonometer used to measure intraocular pressure.|$|E
40|$|The {{size of the}} reflex {{image of}} keratometer mires {{can be used to}} {{determine}} the power of an intraocular lens (IOL) inside the eye (in situ). The dioptric scale reading from the front surface of a convex-plano intraocular lens in cases of unknown power is compared with computed values. The accuracy of the method is demonstrated in a series of patients with known IOL power. Though in our study we have assumed convex-plano lenses are in use, the same procedure can sometimes be applied to lenses of different forms. To interpret scale readings below 30 dioptres and over 60 dioptres we compiled an extension table, suited to the <b>ophthalmometer</b> of Javal-Schiøtz (Haag-Streit), making use of low-powered minus and plus auxiliary lenses in front of the tube of the instrument...|$|E
40|$|Hermann von Helmholtz was a German, {{and one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} individuals in the history of physics and medicine. He made important findings in muscle and nerve physiology, physiological acoustics, and thermodynamics. In addition, his contributions to ophthalmology were enormous. He invented the ophthalmoscope in 1850, developed the <b>ophthalmometer</b> in 1853, and his major publication, ‘Handbook of physiological optics’ in 1856 explained the mechanism of accommodation and produced the first accurate model eye among numerous other things. The invention of the ophthalmoscope can be considered as the single most important advancement in the history of ophthalmology. Prior to the ophthalmoscope, examining the posterior pole of the eye in a living human was not possible. The ophthalmoscope allowed for diseases that were previously unknown to be recognised, making the invention of the ophthalmoscope one of the greatest triumphs in ophthalmology. This report provides a brief biographical account of Helmholtz’s life, and reviews his major contributions to ophthalmology, in particular the ophthalmoscope and it’s impact on ophthalmology.
