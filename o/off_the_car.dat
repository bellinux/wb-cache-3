5|$|David {{challenges}} Elijah with {{an incident}} {{from his childhood}} when he almost drowned. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football because Audrey did not like the violence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Pearson began 1979 {{by winning}} the pole {{position}} at year's first race at Riverside; he finished in second place. 1979 was Pearson's final season racing for the Wood Brothers, with his last race happening at Darlington. After a miscommunication, he left the pits without waiting for the pit crew to place lug nuts on {{the car and the}} tires fell <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> when he reached the end of pit lane. Pearson quit the team after the race. Pearson had won 43 races between 1972 and 79 while driving for the Wood Brothers. Later during the season, Rod Osterlund's rookie driver, Dale Earnhardt, suffered a shoulder injury. Osterlund hired Pearson to replace Earnhardt during four races; he collected the pole position at Michigan and won the 1979 Southern 500. For the season, Pearson had competed in nine races and finished 32nd in points. Fans voted him as NASCAR's Most Popular Driver.|$|E
25|$|In 1922, Duff {{sold the}} S.61 {{and focused on}} making Mephistopheles faster and more reliable. Harry Ricardo made a set of {{aluminum}} pistons and raised the engine’s compression ratio. In May, Duff finished third in Brooklands’ 100Mile Handicap. In its next race, one of the Fiat’s engine blocks detached from the crankcase. When the engine blew, the hood was torn <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> just missing Duff’s head. Engine parts rained down on the track. Duff sold the car for scrap.|$|E

6000|$|... "Jake," [...] he said, [...] "I {{want you}} to go to the Landing and see that the Mappin people send up the plant Watson expects as soon as it's <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b> I shall stay here a while and try to learn {{something}} about my business." ...|$|R
25|$|By {{the middle}} of 1960, the factory {{employed}} forty-three workers, the Grantura Mk1 production was ending (with a total of 100 cars produced), and the Mk2 body shell design was nearly ready. TVR had distributors selling cars in the UK, including David Buxton Ltd. in Derby and Bill Last in Woodbridge, Suffolk. In January 1961, Keith Aitchison and Bryan Hopton (of the Aitchison-Hopton Lotus/TVR dealer in Chester) expressed interest in investing in TVR. During the summer, Bernard Williams attempted to cement their interest by offering a Climax-powered Grantura Mk2 to the two men for a drive to the Monza circuit in Italy. During the trip, {{a portion of the}} exhaust system fell <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> on two separate occasions, but the two men were nonetheless impressed with the car's performance.|$|E
25|$|On {{the night}} of March 22, 1970, Kathleen Johns was driving from San Bernardino to Petaluma to visit her mother. She was seven months {{pregnant}} and had her 10-month-old daughter beside her. While heading west on Highway 132 near Modesto, a car behind her began honking its horn and flashing its headlights. She pulled {{off the road and}} stopped. The man in the car parked behind her, approached her car, stated that he observed that her right rear wheel was wobbling, and offered to tighten the lug nuts. After finishing his work, the man drove off; yet when Johns pulled forward to re-enter the highway the wheel almost immediately came <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> The man returned, offering to drive her to the nearest gas station for help. She and her daughter climbed into his car.|$|E
25|$|Rosenqvist {{tried again}} at passing Verstappen {{entering}} Lisboa corner but the latter again held his position. Auer upfront was now holding a two-second {{advantage over the}} rest of the field, with the hope that no accidents would occur that would necessitate the safety car's deployment. However this would not happen as on the fourth lap, Verstappen lost control of his vehicle under braking in the Solitude Esses and broke his front-left suspension in an impact with the wall. This caused his wheel to dangle <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> along with him sustaining a rear-left puncture. Verstappen lost all turning room while attempting to get round the Melco hairpin but returned to the pit lane and into retirement. In the group behind Latifi was overtaken by King while Coletti was being caught by Fuoco and Serrallés. The safety car was required on the same lap when MacLeod crashed and blocked half the track at Paiol corner since no recovery cranes were in that area of the track. Confusion was created under the safety car as it did not pick up race leader Auer but Goddard instead. Gelael returned to the pit lane to stop him impeding other drivers and retired. The safety car drove into the pit lane on lap seven and racing resumed with Auer leading Rosenqvist.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Gordon {{turned up}} {{half an hour}} ago," [...] Acton said. [...] "It appears {{that he was going}} into the city, and got <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> to talk over things with you. I believe he had a notion of going on again to-night, but Mrs. Acton won't hear of it." ...|$|R
50|$|Sayreville Junction {{was created}} {{almost at the}} {{midpoint}} of the line for storage and classifications of cars. RRRR trains would run straight from either the NYLB or PRR connection, and drop <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> at Sayreville Junction, where they would be sorted for the runs either east or west at that point.|$|R
500|$|Brezhnev's main {{passion was}} driving foreign cars {{given to him}} by leaders of state from across the world. He usually drove these between his dacha and the Kremlin with, {{according}} to historian Robert Service, flagrant disregard for public safety. When visiting the United States for a summit with Nixon in 1973 he expressed a wish to drive a Lincoln Continental which Nixon had just given him around Washington; upon being told that the Secret Service would not allow him to do this he said [...] "I will take the flag <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> put on dark glasses, so they can't see my eyebrows and drive like any American would" [...] to which Henry Kissinger replied [...] "I have driven with you and I don't think you drive like an American!" ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "replicar" [...] was [...] "universally hated by the crew", said Ruck. [...] "It didn't work right." [...] The {{scene in}} which Ferris turns <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> to leave it with the garage {{attendant}} had to be shot a dozen times because it would not start. The car was built with a real wheel base, but used a Ford V8 engine instead of a V12. At the time of filming, the original 250 GT California model was worth $350,000. Since {{the release of the}} film, it {{has become one of the}} most expensive cars ever sold, going at auction in 2008 for $10,976,000 [...] and more recently in 2015 for $16,830,000. The vanity plate of Cameron's dad's Ferrari spells NRVOUS and the other plates seen in the film are homages to Hughes's earlier works, VCTN (National Lampoon's Vacation), TBC (The Breakfast Club), MMOM (Mr. Mom), as well as 4FBDO (Ferris Bueller's Day Off).|$|E
500|$|The {{weather and}} {{conditions}} on the grid were before dry for the race. The air temperature was [...] with signs of a breeze which could blow sand onto the track and impede the cars' grip. Massa got the best start of the frontrunners off the line, as he passed Kubica into the first corner to take the lead. Hamilton's poor start caused his anti-stall system to kick in, and he was passed by six drivers to fall back to ninth. Räikkönen benefited from Hamilton's start by moving up to third, ahead of Kovalainen, Trulli and Heidfeld. As Massa extended his lead {{at the front of}} the race, Hamilton, who trailed Alonso, collided with the back of the Renault, knocking the McLaren's front wing <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b> Suffering handling difficulties, Hamilton returned to the pit-lane for a new nose section, and rejoined in 18th place. Räikkönen took second place when he passed Kubica on lap three; Heidfeld took fourth when he passed Trulli and Kovalainen in separate manoeuvres. Further down the field, Vettel retired from the race on the first lap after twice colliding with other cars; Button, Sutil and Coulthard pitted to repair early damage.|$|E
50|$|An {{idle stop}} feature shuts <b>off</b> <b>the</b> engine {{automatically}} when stopped, then restarts immediately {{when the driver}} removes their foot from the brake. This auto idle stop system contributes to both greater fuel efficiency and lower emissions.During stop and go driving, the engine will turn <b>off</b> when <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{comes to a stop}} for the first time, however, if <b>the</b> <b>car</b> does not go above 10 mph and stops again, the engine will not turn <b>off</b> unless <b>the</b> <b>car</b> is stopped for more than 15 seconds.|$|R

500|$|X was {{introduced}} on the series via {{a phone call}} made to Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in the second season episode [...] "The Host", telling Mulder that he had [...] "a friend in the FBI". However, the character did not appear on-screen until [...] "Sleepless", two episodes later, aiding Mulder in an investigation by leaking information on a secret military project from the Vietnam War. [...] While X's loyalties and his own agenda were often unclear, he proved more than once that he at least does not want Mulder dead. In the episode [...] "End Game", he is approached by Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who pleads {{that she needs to}} know where Mulder is, believing his life to be in danger. Initially X refuses, and is subsequently confronted by Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), who seemed to recognize X. He relinquishes Mulder's location, though not until after a brief but intense scuffle with Skinner. In the episode [...] "731", X's loyalty to Mulder is further confirmed. Trapped on a train car equipped with a time bomb, Mulder, about to escape, is attacked brutally by the Red Haired Man, a Men in Black assassin. X fatally shoots the Red Haired Man as he is about to step <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car,</b> then boards the car with only enough time left to save either Mulder or the alien-human hybrid the car was transporting. He opts to save Mulder, and carries him off to safety just as the car explodes.|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{headlights}} are on!" [...] (Upon turning <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{with the}} headlights on.) A light would also {{appear on the}} dash ...|$|E
2500|$|The conductor, Thomas Dennison, {{asked her}} {{several times to}} leave, and each time she refused. [...] Finally, when a white woman objected to her presence, he grabbed {{her by the arm}} and escorted her <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
60|$|Prescott {{thought this}} {{probable}} {{and determined to}} resume his search in the morning. Presently the gravel train came back and the stream {{of light from the}} head-lamp, blazing along the embankment, rested on the half-buried dump. Then there was a roar as the plow flung <b>the</b> load <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars,</b> and in <b>the</b> silence that followed one of the men got up.|$|R
50|$|In addition, Twilight Sentinel {{also allows}} {{the driver to}} set a timer (located with the {{headlight}} switch) that delays shutting <b>off</b> <b>the</b> headlights for a specified time period, usually up to three minutes. The driver can park <b>the</b> vehicle, shut <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> engine and exit the automobile after dark, then use the headlights to light the path into a nearby building, such as a house, before the system shuts <b>the</b> headlights <b>off</b> automatically.|$|R
50|$|With a 0-60 mph sprint time of just 6.4 seconds, it cut a full 1.5 seconds <b>off</b> <b>the</b> {{standard}} <b>car’s</b> time.|$|R
2500|$|The conductor, W. C. Powers, {{also gave}} a statement. [...] He said {{the car was}} not going very fast as it started across the bridge. [...] As {{soon as he saw}} the red light, he opened the trolley's door and alerted the {{passengers}} to jump from the car. [...] The conductor then jumped himself, just before the car struck the wooden gate before the open draw. [...] He saw a number people jump <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On {{his return}} to Australia, [...] "It's Too Late" [...] became his {{eleventh}} Australian hit, but O'Keefe was broke and upset. To cover his US failure, he bought a bright red imported 1959 Plymouth Belvedere on hire purchase and began touring relentlessly {{up and down the}} east coast of Australia to pay <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and replenish his finances, returning to Sydney every Saturday to present Six O'Clock Rock. [...] JOK at one stage employed low pressure in the car tyres as this made them squeal when turning corners.|$|E
2500|$|With {{problems}} {{both on and}} off-track, he left {{racing and}} started reading. He read about {{the human body and}} mind. After he returned to racing a changed person. He took all of his sponsors <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and used only black and white paint. He changed from his familiar number 18 to number 0. He put the yin yang symbol {{in the middle of the}} [...] "0" [...] to represent the balance that he found in his life. He later raced the number [...] "0" [...] car with a skull and crossbones through the middle of the number.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{accompanying}} behind-the-scenes featurette of the 2006 DVD {{release of the}} film, Hickman can be seen co-ordinating the chase from the street where we see a stuntman in a parked car opens his door as Hickman's vehicle takes it <b>off</b> its hinges. <b>The</b> end of the chase was Hickman's [...] "homage" [...] {{to the death of}} Jayne Mansfield, where Scheider's car (driven by Summers) smashes {{into the back of a}} parked tractor-trailer, peeling <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> roof.|$|R
50|$|The {{bus service}} between Dallas and Denton began {{offering}} lower fares from 1925, {{and though the}} line to Terrell was profitable, the Denton line was never financially successful. The rail service was withdrawn on March 13, 1932, after the Dallas Union Trust Company foreclosed on the Texas Interurban Railway. The property was auctioned <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> transferred to <b>the</b> Dallas Railway and Terminal Company and some were later used as trolleys in Dallas until 1956.|$|R
60|$|Charnock {{began his}} work as usual with the gravel gang. It was his {{business}} to spread <b>the</b> ballast thrown <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> by <b>the</b> plow that traveled along the train, and although the labor was not exhausting it had tried his strength at first. His muscles, however, were hardening, and until the last few days, {{he had been able}} to scatter heavy shovelfuls of stones with a dexterous jerk that distributed them among the ties.|$|R
2500|$|The Porsche {{engineers}} obliged, but {{in doing}} so, caused the new brake ducts {{to interfere with}} the bodywork closure pins, which attach the bodywork to the car. Coming out of turn seven, the rear bodywork flew <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> at approximately , causing the car to become extremely unstable. The car lifted off the ground and tumbled multiple times down the track. The front of the car was completely torn away, leaving Donohue, still strapped to his safety seat, with his legs dangling outside the car. Amazingly, Donohue only suffered a broken leg. George Follmer, Donohue's old Trans-Am teammate, resumed testing the 917-10 while Donohue was recuperating. In classic Donohue style, Donohue said of Follmer testing his car: ...|$|E

60|$|A {{measured}} throb rolled {{across the}} woods, {{and as the}} noise got louder {{the beat of the}} exhaust marked the progress of the train. The explosive snorts indicated that the locomotive labored up the last steep pitch, and Lister sat down by the rails. He was tired and would not be needed until the gravel plough threw <b>the</b> rattling ballast <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b> After a few moments he looked up, for a man came out of the gloom.|$|R
50|$|Preparing for the Shell Eco Marathon 2010 the DNV Fuel Fighter team {{wanted to}} take <b>the</b> <b>car</b> even further. This year the hard work did not pay <b>off</b> and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> never managed to finish any attempt.|$|R
