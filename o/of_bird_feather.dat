50|$|A plume is {{a special}} type <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> <b>feather,</b> possessed by egrets, ostriches, birds of paradise, quetzals, {{pheasants}} and peacocks. They often have a decorative or ornamental purpose, commonly used among marching bands and the military, worn on the hat or helmet of the wearer. When used on military headdresses, the clipped feather plume {{is referred to as}} the hackle.|$|E

40|$|To reduce {{friction}} drag with bionic method {{in a more}} feasible way, the surface microstructure <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> <b>feather</b> was analyzed attempting to reveal the biologic features responding to skin {{friction drag}} reduction. Then comparative bionic surface mimicking bird feather was fabricated through hot-rolling technology for drag reduction. The microriblet film was formed on a PVC substrate through a self-developed hot-rolling equipment. The bionic surface with micron-scale riblets formed spontaneously due to the elastic-plastic deformation of PVC in high temperature and high pressure environment. Comparative experiments between micro-structured bionic surface and smooth surface were performed in a wind tunnel to evaluate the effect of bionic surface on drag reduction, and significant drag reduction efficiency was obtained. Numerical simulation results show that microvortex induced in the solid-gas interface of bionic surface {{has the effect of}} shear stress reduction and the small level of an additional pressure drag resulting from pressure distribution deviation on bird feather like surface, hence reducing the skin friction drag significantly. Therefore, with remarkable drag reduction performance and simple fabrication technology, the proposed drag reduction technique shows the promise for practical applications...|$|E

40|$|In nature, aquatic birds can {{interact}} with water without their feathers being easily wetted; some species dive tens of meters and emerge to spread their wings to dry. In past studies attempting to connect such ecological behavior and feather structure, the typical approach of microscopy has demonstrated {{the difficulty in}} characterizing specimens as delicate and complex as feathers by visual techniques alone. In this work, the question was addressed of how various species balance the wettability problem {{with the need to}} dive to various depths or to remain on or near the water surface as dictated by their feeding habits. Texture of wing feathers from six different species of aquatic birds was characterized by measuring contact angles and applying the previously developed framework of the effective spacing ratio, D*, and robustness factor, A*, according to the Cassie-Baxter relation for composite interfaces. This "effective microscopy" technique was successfully employed to assess the wettability and robustness <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> <b>feather</b> textures. The observable water-related behaviors of diving, wing-spreading, shallow foraging, and dabbling for the species studied were explained as partly determined by feather structure, exhibiting effective- D* analysis as an adequate technique for characterizing complex, textured surfaces, fabricated or natural. by Jesus O.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Biological SciencesWild birds rely on plumage for protection, {{reproductive}} display, and flight. Alterations {{to feather}} structure or color by symbiotic microbes may reduce survival and reproductive fitness. Feathers are waxy oligotrophic environments low in moisture and rich in recalcitrant beta-keratin subject to freezing temperatures and high UV radiation. Ventral feathers were sterilely collected from wild dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis) by mist net capture and shaken in a chaotropic solution to dislodge bacterial cells. More than 300 bacterial isolates, mainly Gram-positive cocci and bacilli, {{were collected by}} serial dilution of enrichment cultures and purified by repetitive streaking on agar plates to generate an isolate collection. Isolates were tested {{for their ability to}} degrade keratin, the principle component of feathers, as well as other biochemical tests. Approximately half of the isolates were able to grow on keratin as a sole carbon and energy source. Surveys <b>of</b> <b>bird</b> <b>feather</b> samples were also tested for their ability to establish colonies under conditions mimicking environmental stressors such as desiccation and temperature extremes. Phylogenetic analysis of PCR-amplified 16 S rRNA gene sequences from the isolate collection showed substantial bacterial diversity including representatives of the genera Bacillus, Rhizobium, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas and Sphingomonas.
