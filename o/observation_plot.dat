40|$|Computer {{simulation}} models {{were used to}} compare a duplicated augmented design (DAD), consisting of 2 sets of augmented design (AD), with a randomized complete block design (RCBD) and incomplete block design (IBD). Two field trials were also carried out using the same experimental techniques during 1986 - 87. The AD consisted of blocks of plots flanked by regular or random controls, which enabled adjustments for block effects. The DAD was run with randomization of treatments using 1 fixed and 2 random controls. Results indicated that IBD is less input demanding and more efficient than DAD. The use of DADs and unreplicated AD with regular controls is questioned, as they did not provide more useful information than sets of <b>observation</b> <b>plots</b> without repeated controls and can cost 20...|$|R

40|$|Research {{goal is to}} {{investigate}} the dynamics of vegetation, composition and type of vegetation that grows naturally in the area used for cultivation in natural forest village where formerly the foreman that former shifting cultivation area has long been neglected and suffered natural regeneration. To determine the distribution and abundance of several types of vegetation used in the field by the method of vegetation analysis or transect lines by laying the first swath of purposive sampling (intentionally). In this study with the observation made 3 lanes each path length ± 300 meters and a width of 20 meters. Distance between lines 100 meters, in one lane there were 15 <b>plots</b> <b>observation</b> that in one location <b>observation</b> <b>plots</b> contained 45 <b>observations.</b> So extensive observation location throughout the area used for cultivation is 1, 8 Ha x 3 jalur = 5, 4 Ha. Of {{the result of this}} study concluded to have formed the dinamics of vegetation in the area used for cultivation, this has caused the formation of patterns of diversity and structure of forest vegetation and forest vegetation that is already in a state of climax.

500|$|The {{history of}} surface weather {{analysis}} concerns the timetable of developments related to surface weather analysis. [...] Initially {{a tool of}} study for the behavior of storms, surface weather analyses became {{a work in progress}} to explain current weather and as an aid for short term weather forecasting. Initial efforts to create surface weather analyses began in the mid-19th century by using surface weather observations to analyze isobars, isotherms, and display temperature and cloud cover. By the mid-20th century, much more information was being placed upon the station models plotted on weather maps and surface fronts, per the Norwegian cyclone model, were being analyzed worldwide. Eventually, <b>observation</b> <b>plotting</b> went from a manual exercise to an automated task for computers and plotters. Surface analysis remains a manual and partially subjective exercise, whether it be via hand and paper, or via a workstation.|$|R
40|$|Forest Focus (Regulation (EC) No 2152 / 2003) is a Community {{scheme for}} harmonised, broad-based, {{comprehensive}} and long-term monitoring of European forest ecosystems. It concentrates in particular on protecting forests against {{air pollution and}} fire. To supplement the monitoring system, Forest Focus stipulates {{the development of new}} instruments relating to soil monitoring, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, climate change and protective functions of forests. Under this scheme the monitoring of air pollution effects on forests is carried out by participating countries {{on the basis of the}} systematic network of observation points (Level I) and of the network of <b>observation</b> <b>plots</b> for intensive and continuous monitoring (Level II). The monitoring activity continues from the network and plots established and implemented under Council Regulation (EEC) No 3528 / 86. and Regulations (EEC) No 1696 / 87 and (EC) No 1091 / 94. The monitoring programme of air pollution effects is linked to International Cooperative Programme on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forest (ICP Forests). ICP Forests reports to the working Group on Effects of the Convention of the Long-Range Trans-boundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP) of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN-ECE). Forest Focus Article 15 (1) stipulates that the Member States shall annually, through the designated authorities and agencies, forward to the Commission geo-referenced data gathered under the scheme, together with a report on them by means of computer telecommunications and/or electronic technology. For managing the data DG JRC has implemented a Forest Focus Monitoring Database System. The system was developed and realized under contract by a Consortium, coordinated by I-MAGE Consult with Nouvelles Solutions Informatiques s. a. (NSI) as consortium partner and the Bundesforschungsanstalt für Forst- und Holzwirtschaft (BFH) as sub-contractor. The designated authorities and agencies submitted annually to DG Joint Research Centre of the European Commission their observations made on the network of <b>observation</b> <b>plots</b> for intensive and continuous monitoring (Level II). Data are submitted via a Web-Module specifically designed for the task as part of the Forest Focus Monitoring Database System. JRC. DDG. H. 7 -Land management and natural hazard...|$|R
