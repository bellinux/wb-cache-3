5|$|The root <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> was an {{economic}} crisis—initiated by the Panic of 1837—which was entering its sixth year in 1842. A speculative bubble had burst in 1836–39, causing {{a collapse of}} the financial sector and a subsequent depression. The country became deeply divided over the best response to the crisis. Conditions got even worse in early 1842 because a deadline was looming. A decade earlier, when the economy was strong, Congress had promised Southern states {{that there would be}} a reduction in hated federal tariffs. Northern states welcomed tariffs, which protected their infant industries. But the South had no industrial base and depended on open access to British markets for their cotton. In a recommendation to Congress, Tyler lamented that it would be necessary to override the Compromise Tariff of 1833 and raise rates beyond the 20 percent limit. Under the previous deal, this would suspend the distribution program, with all revenues going to the federal government.|$|E
5|$|During another {{summer with}} his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon, Harry Potter and Dudley are {{attacked}} by Dementors. After using magic to save Dudley and himself, Harry is expelled from Hogwarts, {{but the decision}} is later rescinded. Harry is whisked off {{by a group of}} wizards (including the real Mad-Eye Moody, Professor Lupin, and several new faces, including Nymphadora Tonks, a bubbly young witch who is a Metamorphmagus , and Kingsley Shacklebolt, a senior Auror who believes everyone is equal) to Number 12, Grimmauld Place, the former home of his godfather, Sirius Black. The building also serves as the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, of which Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Lupin, Mad-Eye, and Sirius are members. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger explain that the Order of the Phoenix is a secret organisation led by Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore, dedicated to fighting Lord Voldemort and his followers, the Death Eaters. From the members of the Order, Harry and the others learn that Voldemort is seeking an object {{that he did not have}} prior to his first defeat, and assume this object to be a weapon of some sort. Harry learns that the Ministry of Magic, led by Cornelius Fudge, is refusing to acknowledge Voldemort's return because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> that doing so would cause, and has been running a smear campaign against him and Dumbledore.|$|E
25|$|The Williamses {{pulled away}} from the McLarens who were pulling away from the Ferraris (Prost had by now passed Alesi). On lap 18, Patrese waved Mansell through and decided to follow him. The McLarens stopped first and Senna got ahead of Berger. When Mansell stopped on lap 29, his crew had trouble fixing the wheelnut of his right rear properly. As the Williams {{mechanic}} went to get a spare nut, the lollipop man, unaware <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> signalled for Mansell to depart. Immediately, his right rear fell off and he stopped {{in the middle of the}} pitlane. The team retrieved the tyre, fixed it on Mansell's car and sent him on his way but he had dropped to 17th.|$|E

25|$|Dana Elcar as Pete Thornton, MacGyver's {{boss and}} best friend. He was an {{operative}} at the Department of External Services (DXS), {{which is where}} he is impressed by Mac's ingenuity while tracking down Murdoc (Michael Des Barres), an international assassin and master of disguise. When Thornton becomes director of operations at the Phoenix Foundation several years later, he brings MacGyver into the program. In addition to sending Mac out on various tasks for the foundation, Thornton is many times forced to bail MacGyver out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> he gets into. Thornton has a son named Michael. Late in the show it is learned that Pete has glaucoma, an element written in because of Elcar developing glaucoma in real life. Dana Elcar is first cast in the pilot episode as Andy Colson, the Chief of Operations at the KIVA Laboratories.|$|E
25|$|To {{many people}} it {{appeared}} that the trouble in Larut was merely a continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> between the Ghee Hin and Tua Pek Kong societies in Ujong Salang in 1859 which later spread to Penang. The Larut Wars were fought between Hakka and Hakka. The Hai San miners were mainly Hakka men from Cheng Sheng. The first two battles (1861 and 1865) were between the Cheng Sheng Hakka of the Hai San and the Hui Chew Hakka of the Ghee Hin. The Last two (1872 and 1873) were between the Cheng Sheng Hakka of the Hai San and the Sin Neng Hakka of the Ghee Hin, the Hui Chew Hakka from the Ghee Hin from the earlier two battles having gone down to Selangor to join Yap Ah Loy, a Hui Chew Hakka who was head of the Hai San in Selangor. Lee Ah Kun (Lee Ko Yin), Ho Ghi Siu and Chin Seng Yam (陈亚炎, Chin Ah Yam 陳亞炎) were Sin Neng Hakka.|$|E
25|$|Former Partizan player Slaviša Jokanović were {{appointed}} as Partizan's new head coach, {{with the club}} also adding a new sport director in Ivan Tomić. The club strengthened its squad with some foreigners like Juca, Almami Moreira and Lamine Diarra. The 2007–08 and 2008–09 season will remain {{as one of the}} most successful in club's domestic history. In 2008–09, the club successfully defended their league and cup double from the 2007–08 season, the first time this occurred its history. But in Europe, Partizan suffered a real shock: UEFA expelled Partizan from the 2007–08 UEFA Cup season and fined the club €30,056 due to crowd trouble at their away qualifying match against Zrinjski Mostar, which forced the match to be interrupted for ten minutes. UEFA judged travelling Partizan fans to have been the culprits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble,</b> but Partizan were allowed to play the return leg while the appeal was being processed. Partizan's appeal, however, was rejected and Zrinjski Mostar qualified for the next round, although Partizan beat them by an aggregate score of 11–1. Next season, the club enforced its squad with Brazilian striker Cléo; Partizan demolished Welsh champions Rhyl with a score of 8–0 (12–0 on aggregate) on 21 July 2009. This score is their largest ever winning margin in European competitions. After relegation from the Champions League, Partizan qualified two times in a row for the second tier of UEFA competition. The Black & Whites played in the 2008 UEFA Cup and 2009 Europa League group stage but as the same in 2007, the club did not advance any further.|$|E

Upon arrival, they discover that Brian's mother died one year {{prior to their}} arrival, was taxidermied {{and turned into a}} table by the puppy mill owners as a memorial. With Stewie's reluctant help, Brian gives his mother a proper burial. The pair eventually complete their journey home by riding in an open boxcar, where Brian attempts to apologize to Stewie for all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble</b> he has put both of them through, only to have Stewie reply that he actually enjoyed it.

Royal authority quickly diminished because various claimantsJohn Corvinus, Maximilian of the Romans, Vladislaus Jagiellon, and the latter's younger brother, John Albertwere fighting for the crown. Vladislaus Jagiellon triumphed because the barons regarded him as a weak ruler and he gained the support of Matthias's wealthy widow by promising to marry her. Vladislaus was elected king after he promised he would abolish all [...] "harmful innovations" [...] introduced by Matthias, especially the extraordinary tax. Vladislaus could not finance {{the maintenance of the}} Black Army and the unpaid mercenaries began plundering the countryside.

500|$|The {{girlfriend of}} Mazeroski's son, Rick, Katie, {{is the latest}} to be found, and her blood is found to contain an unknown {{alkaloid}} substance {{and high levels of}} scopolamine, a controlled substance.

Meanwhile, the agents meet an old man who points to a pair of men injecting growth serum into cattle, which he believes is the cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble.</b> That night, local doctor Jerrold Larson is killed in a plane crash. An investigation of the site turns up shipping orders that trace back to the kidnapped teens. One of the men injecting the cows is murdered by the Crew Cut Man. The other, a peeping tom named Gerd Thomas, is revealed to be the kidnapper after the agents find a hidden supply of videotapes in the home of one of the victims. Thomas claims that Larson had been turning the children into [...] "monsters" [...] with the drugs he had been injecting in them, which he claims to be unknown.|$|E

500|$|Football hooliganism {{reached its}} height in the 1970s and 80s. West Ham's Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers firm {{were at the}} {{forefront}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>trouble,</b> not just against each other, but against the police and firms associated with other football teams. In 1972, the two clubs played {{each other in a}} testimonial match for Millwall defender Harry Cripps, who began his career at West Ham. The game was marred by intense fighting between the two club's hooligan firms, {{both inside and outside the}} ground. Four years later, a Millwall supporter, Ian Pratt, died at New Cross railway station after falling out of a train during a fight with some West Ham fans. After the incident West Ham hooligans constructed the chant, [...] "West Ham boys, we've got brains, we throw Millwall under trains." [...] Millwall fans waited patiently for two years for revenge, until West Ham were relegated to the Second Division. Prior to their next meeting with the Hammers on 7 October 1978, leaflets were distributed at Millwall's home matches bearing the words: [...] "A West Ham fan must die to avenge him." [...] The police responded with an unprecedented show of force for the game at Upton Park, which West Ham won 3–0. Some 500 officers controlled the crowd, carrying out extensive searches and strict segregation.|$|E
