40|$|In this project, {{a method}} to extract tectonic {{activity}} – induced vertical displacements from InSAR along one-dimensional features (roads, pipelines, aqueducts), is presented and the reliability of this method is evaluated. The evaluation is performed by a comparison of In-SAR results and terrestrial surveying. The test field is in the north – west region <b>of</b> <b>Attiki</b> prefecture, 20 km {{from the center of}} Athens and the one – dimensional feature is the Mornos aqueduct. The displacements – at least the greatest part – are due to the 07 / 09 / 1999 Athens earthquake. The way to make InSAR and terrestrial surveying data compatible and therefore directly comparable includes the well-known InSAR processing actions of interferogram filtering for partial noise removal and phase unwrapping to resolve the Φmod 2 π ambiguity. It also includes geodetic reference system transformations – necessary in the cases when the interferogram is in other reference system than the one used in terrestrial measurements, and computation of incidence angles for every interferogram target to convert LOS projected displacements to vertical ones. Ultimately, the problem of temporal decorrelation is dealt with mathematical modeling of the displacement field...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Three-dimensional {{velocity}} {{structure of}} the upper crust was determined by inversion of P-wave travel times in the region <b>of</b> <b>Attiki</b> Prefecture (Greece), located at {{the eastern part of}} the Greek mainland, which is traditionally considered as an area of low seismicity. An earthquake of Ms = 5. 9 occurred there, on September 7, 1999, causing extensive damage in the metropolitan area of Athens. A two-step tomographic procedure was applied to investigate the 3 -D crustal velocity structure. The data set consisted of travel time residuals of 466 very well located earthquakes. In order to improve the initial velocity model, before the inversion of the data, a ‘minimum 1 -D ’ initial velocity model was obtained and, therefore, for the first time a reliable velocity model for the region was derived. The results show that the velocity distribution is influenced rather from the geology than the seismotectonic regime of the region. At shallow depths (less than 4 km) the velocity increases gradually with respect to the depth without any sharp variation. On the contrary, the lateral variation of velocity seems to be affected from the geological regime of the region. The low velocities at this depth seem to be typical for sedimentary basins, like those of the investigated region. At deeper layers (larger than 5 km) a different picture is obtained where both the lateral and vertical velocity variations are sharply pronounced. At the depth of 8. 5 km, the aftershock area is covered by relativel...|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that the Information Society (IS) offers great potential in promoting sustainable development, democracy, accountability and good governance. Full {{exploitation of the}} new opportunities provided by ICTs should be {{an important part of}} any strategy aimed at achieving development goals. Greece is a regional country in the EU and some of the Greek regions are amongst the least developed within the Union. Therefore, the importance of the Information Society, with regard to regional development in Greece, becomes greater as it provides an opportunity for Greek regions to catch up. The aim of this chapter is to identify the main trends and problems of the Information Society in Greek regions, evaluate regional strategies and measures and discover threats and opportunities for the future development of Greek regions. As the development of IS seems to be a key point in the success of regional development policies, the importance of careful and appropriate planning becomes imperative. As available data shows, the development of the Information Society in Greek regions does not seem to follow a specific pattern. With the exception of the region <b>of</b> <b>Attiki,</b> there are no regions that systematically perform better or worse. An attempt to discover correlations with non-IS indicators (such as economic, employment or R&D indicators), shows that no such correlations exist. Until recently, regions in Greece did not have separate strategies regarding IS development. However, since 2002, each region has been given funding to develop its own Operational Plan for the Information Society. These Regional Operational Plans, which provided the means for all Regional Administrations to determine region-specific goals and aims {{for the development of the}} Information Society at the regional level, form a basis for a comparative analysis of the Greek regions...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: Surgical {{procedures}} include invasive surgical {{techniques that}} affect the patients’ physical and psychosocial status and increase the levels of anxiety. Aim: To assess {{the relationship between the}} preoperative information provided to surgical patient and the preoperative anxiety. Methodology: The research study took place between September and December 2015 using a descriptive correlational design. The study sample consisted of 124 surgical patients of a general hospital of the region <b>of</b> <b>Attiki,</b> Athens. Inclusion of participants in the study was based on specific criteria. Data were collected by using a questionnaire, developed by the researchers after an extensive literature review and the anxiety depression scale HADS (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Ethical procedures were taken into account throughout the research study. Data analysis was performed using SPSS 19. 0 statistical program. Results: The majority of the patients (70. 2 %), stated that they were satisfied by the amount of information provided, while 56. 1 % stated that they wished to have some additional information. Most of the patients (86. 1 %) reported that the preoperative information provided before surgery was very beneficial to them. The outcome of the surgical procedure (56. 5 %) and postoperative pain (48. 4 %) were strongly associated with preoperative anxiety. The desire for more information was positively correlated with depressive symptoms. Patients who wished to obtain detailed information before surgery and those who felt that the information was beneficial to them before surgery were less likely to develop symptoms of depression. The high educational level of patients appeared to have a positive correlation with preoperative anxiety. Conclusions: Provision of information at a preoperative stage can reduce preoperative anxiety and depressive symptoms. Further investigation is essential taking into account the unique characteristics and the specific needs of the patients...|$|E

For each building, the data elements stored are its name, the creators (architects and others), the architectural style, the building materials, the geographic region and exact address and subject terms. There are also included comments of architectural and historiacl interest. The record structure is based on Unimarc. All above information which describe a building correspond to Unimarc fields, either to exactly equivalent, or to the most "relative", {{if there is not}} a full equivalence.

40|$|Abstract The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} primary school teachers’ perceptions of teaching students with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD). Initially, a literature review of relevant studies from around the world was conducted and at a second stage a preliminary qualitative study was conducted in order to investigate the perceptions of twelve primary school teachers from four different schools <b>of</b> South <b>Attiki,</b> Greece. A thematic analysis of the semi-structured interviews showed that these teachers perceive students with AD/HD as disruptive, inattentive, hyperactive and with no control over their actions. These perceptions indicate that teachers continue to view their students through the medical model of disability and that its power in the educational forum is strong. Moreover, it was noticed that teachers have faith in the “experts” as far as medication is concerned, and that they perceive themselves to lack time and sometimes strength and what is more, see the need for more collaboration with the parents. Last, teachers believe in the effectiveness of behavioural strategies for handling students with AD/HD but also consider as an effective method, the physical and emotional touch with the students.

40|$|This paper calculates the {{environmental}} effects <b>of</b> the <b>Attiki</b> Odos (AOD) motorway investment expenditures in the Athens Metropolitan Area (AMA), Greece. The AOD {{is incorporated in}} the Trans-European Networks (TEN) and is a priority project aimed at developing the AMA. Input – output analysis is applied to assess {{the environmental}} impacts of the investments expenditures. More precisely, we apply the environmental input-output life cycle assessment (EIOLCA) method to estimate ex-post the environmental burden associated with the investment vector of AOD. In this context, we calculate each type of emission caused by the AOD investments expenditures (direct, indirect and induced), by sector of economic activity during the construction phase (1999 - 2004). The investment vector is assembled from figures calculated based on corporate data. Next, in order to estimate the impact of technological change on our estimates, we use ceteris paribus the 2005 input – output table, which expresses, in a nutshell, the production technology of 2005. The domestic input-output tables for 2000 and 2005 come from EUROSTAT. In this framework, the main finding of the paper is that technological change between 2000 and 2005, as expressed through each year’s technical coefficients matrix, provided significant results with respect to total output and emissions. Roughly speaking, total output increased approximately by 7 % and emissions decreased approximately by 19 %...|$|R

Setting: General Hospital <b>of</b> Piraeus “Tzaneio”, <b>Attiki,</b> Greece. Materials and methods: A total of 333 eyes with corneal astigmatism ≤ 1. 5 diopters (D) underwent cataract surgery. A three-step superotemporal clear corneal incision for the right eye and a superonasal clear corneal incision for the left eye (3. 0 mm) was made, while the sideport incision was located at 110 °. Keratometric data were measured with corneal topography EyeSys Vista 2000 pre- and postoperatively at the 1 st and 6 th month. Surgically induced astigmatism was calculated by vector analysis. We noted all cases in which a change > 0. 5 D in corneal astigmatic power occurred, {{as well as a}} change > 20 ° in axis torque, despite axis direction. Results: After multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted, cases with > 110 ° distance between the tunnel and sideport incision had 2. 22 times (P= 0. 021) greater likelihood for having changed > 0. 5 D in astigmatic power at the 1 st month and 3. 45 times (P= 0. 031) at the 6 th month postoperatively, as compared with cases with a 90 °– 110 ° distance between the tunnel and sideport incision. As for the change in the astigmatic axis, cases with 20 ° (P< 0. 001) (preoperative to 1 st month) as compared with cases having 90 °– 110 ° of distance. Conclusion: For surgeons that operate only from the superior position, we propose that in order to produce an incision that is as “astigmatically neutral” as possible, they should perform the sideport incision at a 90 °– 110 ° distance.
