5|$|According to the {{historical}} account provided by Xenophon, he is murdered as an acting general <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> expedition {{on its way to}} Rhodes, on a stopover in Aspendus on the Eurymedon River during the night by angry inhabitants of that area, for his soldiers' recent transgressions of excess against local farmers and their farmsteads.|$|E

By June 1940, the Allies had been defeated in Western Europe and Scandinavia. Rather than come to terms with Germany, Britain rejected all overtures for a negotiated peace.|$|E

5|$|After adolescence, most {{physical}} training for males was <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> nature. The Campus Martius originally was an exercise field where young men developed {{the skills of}} horsemanship and warfare. Hunting was also considered an appropriate pastime. According to Plutarch, conservative Romans disapproved of Greek-style athletics that promoted a fine body for its own sake, and condemned Nero's efforts to encourage gymnastic games in the Greek manner.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war in Europe, Inglis was one of New Zealand's delegates for the Allied Control Commission for Germany, which {{administered}} the now occupied country.

After six months in this role, in February 1947 he was promoted to major general and made chief judge of the Allied Control Commission's Supreme Court. The following year he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E

5|$|D {{departs from}} {{traditional}} wargaming and assigns each player a specific character to play instead <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> formation. These characters embark upon imaginary adventures within a fantasy setting. A Dungeon Master {{serves as the}} game's referee and storyteller while maintaining the setting in which the adventures occur, and {{playing the role of}} the inhabitants. The characters form a party that interacts with the setting's inhabitants, and each other. Together they solve dilemmas, engage in battles, and gather treasure and knowledge. In the process the characters earn experience points in order to rise in levels, and become increasingly powerful over a series of sessions.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, {{or perhaps}} because of it, Louis XVIII forced Gazan into {{retirement}} in Grasse, where the aging general dabbled unsuccessfully in politics. After the 1830 revolution, the new King of the French Louis Philippe made Gazan a peer of France, and he received a command <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> division in Marseille. By this time, he was an old man, and in poor health, and he retired in June 1832. Gazan de la Peyriére died in Grasse on 9 April 1845.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{continued}} {{to maintain the}} diplomatic relations with the Tsardom of Russia originally established by her deceased brother.

The Tsar even proposed to her once, and during his later reign, asked for a guarantee to be granted asylum in England should his rule be jeopardised.|$|E

5|$|Finally, Justice Scalia chastises the Court {{for taking}} equity {{jurisdiction}} {{of the case and}} draws an analogy with Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 U.S. 738 (1975). In that case, the Supreme Court declined passing judgment on the decision <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> court-martial before it finished its work; Scalia argues that likewise, the military commissions in Cuba have not yet ended their work regarding Hamdan and therefore should not be subject to judicial oversight.|$|E
5|$|He {{spent much}} of his time writing {{articles}} in military journals on Soviet strategic operations and most notably, co-authored the six-volume work on Soviet involvement during World War II, The Soviet Union's Great Patriotic War (1941–1945). In August 1967, Bagramyan accompanied General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and Premier Alexei Kosygin to North Vietnam, where they met with Vietnamese leaders as he, serving in the role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> expert, helped negotiate the transfer of logistics and arms to the country during the Vietnam War.|$|E
5|$|He was not {{an elegant}} exponent. His normal {{language}} is flat and monotonous. But uneven, and significantly so. For this author is erudite, a fancier of words, and a collector. Hence many rarities, or even inventions... first, when depicting the measures <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> disciplinarian, he brings in technical terms redolent of the camp. Second, archaism, preciosity, and flowery words.|$|E
