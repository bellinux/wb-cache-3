40|$|The {{issue of}} {{accounting}} depreciation is an older concern of this study's authors on the incidence over the true and fair {{view of the}} earning and the net value of the non- current assets. Proceeding from the consideration that the present depreciation methods, acknowleged by the accounting standards and regulations are not sufficient to render the reality of the irreversible impairment of the fixed assets nor that of the material and immaterial investment recovery we performed a research on the indicators reported by 20 companies in Cluj county and we applied a questionnaire to each entity on the depreciation methods used, their incidence on the {{true and fair view}} and their proposals for the completion of the depreciation methods. The objective of the research is to identify the most appropriate depreciation methods, truthfully illustrating the effects of the irreversible impairment on the net asset and on the earning, to introduce the excluded assests in the cathegory of the non-current assets (like property and plant, goodwill, intangible assets created with ones own strengths) and the enforcement of appropriate treatments to the revaluation differences and their own <b>overhead</b> <b>investments.</b> The International Accounting Standard IAS 16 - Property, plant and equipment refers to three depreciation methods: the straightline method, the diminishing balance method and the technical depreciation method (units of production method). In Romania only two of these methods are accepted: the straightline method, the diminishing balance method and the accelerated method was additionally instilled, which is used internationally in exceptional situations and not currently. The results of the research led us to the following conclusions: - for the depreciation of the machinery, facilities and technological equipments it is recommended to use the technical depreciation method or the units of production method; -taking into consideration the financial conception on the non-current assets the depreciation of all cathegories of tangible and intangible assets is recommended, the purpose being the gradual recovery of the investment in these assets and not the covering of the wear and tear or obsolescence; - the surplus value resulted from the revaluation of the tangible assets musn't be depreciated because it generates in fictional expenses; - the depreciation of the overhead assets musn't be acknowledged as an expense but it should be treated as a reduction in the income resulting from fixed assets; -the completion of the depreciation concept with its financial meaning, namely the process of recovering the investments in tangible and intangible assets; The application of the research results leads to correcting the image provided by financial reportings on the tangible and intangible assets contribution to the income, the depreciation's reflection in the expenses and the net value of these assets. The contribution of the authors consists in interceding to ensure the application of the research results by modifying and completing the national accounting rules in order to achieve accounting's consecrated objective: reproducing a true and fair view on the financial position and performances. These issues have not been addressed in other specialty studies in the country or abroad...|$|E

Similarly, few companies overcome the <b>overhead</b> <b>investment</b> in time and effort required to benefit from the wealth of information lying within the masses of tables available. However, there is a growing appetite for big and small data of all types and there are some excellent examples of enterprising companies creating added value from official statistics, for example www. zoopla. co. uk which offers a fascinating insight into house prices and valuations in the UK based on registered house sales and www. innovantage. co. uk which searches the web for job adverts and collates and digests them, selling the information on to recruitment agencies and others interested in labour market trends. Official statistics provide a comparison to data gathered from different sources and help identify short-comings in either direction. The Open Data Institute in London is a hub for entrepreneurs with ideas for using data. Data hacks in which data owners, designers and computer enthusiasts come together to share their expertise are gathering interest. The Royal Statistical Society recently hosted a seminar bringing together these ideas.

We apply a regression discontinuity design to the votes on shareholder-sponsored SoP proposals. Adopting SoP leads to large increases in market value (4 %) and to improvements in long-term performance: profitability and labor productivity increase, while <b>overheads</b> and <b>investment</b> fall. In contrast, we find limited effects on pay levels and structure. This suggests that SoP serves as a regular vote of confidence on the CEO, which leads to higher efficiency and market value...|$|R

Despite the rapid development in open source software for analysis of such data, the practical implementation of these tools through construction of sequencing analysis pipelines still remains a challenging and laborious activity, and a major hurdle for many small research and clinical laboratories. We developed TREVA (Targeted REsequencing Virtual Appliance), making pre-built pipelines immediately available as a virtual appliance. Based on virtual machine technologies, TREVA is a solution for rapid and efficient deployment of complex bioinformatics pipelines to laboratories of all sizes, enabling reproducible results. The analyses that are supported in TREVA include: somatic and germline single-nucleotide and insertion/deletion variant calling, copy number analysis, and cohort-based analyses such as pathway and significantly mutated genes analyses. TREVA is flexible and easy to use, and can be customised by Linux-based extensions if required. TREVA can also be deployed on the cloud (cloud computing), enabling instant access without <b>investment</b> <b>overheads</b> for additional hardware. TREVA is available at [URL]...|$|R
40|$|In recent {{economic}} geography, it is {{emphasized that the}} effect of cost decreasing in transportation on agglomeration is nonlinear. It is said that the influence of traffic infrastructure investment and the change in transportation cost on urban agglomeration does not appear until the cost is below a certain amount, and that once agglomeration arises that effect would be kept with higher probability. In theoretical models such as Krugman (1991) and Fujita, Krugman and Venables (1999), multiple equilibria and path dependence are emphasized, as well as non linearity. Those models are intuitive, {{but it is hard to}} have a statistical analysis because of the non linearity. About the macroeconomic effect of social <b>overhead</b> capital <b>investment,</b> starting from the analysis by Aschauer (1985, 1989), a lot of empirical research has been done on the productivity effect of social capital. For example, we have Asako et al. (1994), Mitsui and Ohta (1995). Moreover, Roback (1982) uses the Hedonic approach to find the effect of amenity-based social overhead capital (related to waste disposal plants, or sewage facilities), followed by Mitsui and Hayashi (2001) for a Japanese case. In these Japanese studies, they are only concerned about the topic about inefficiency of the social overhead capital distribution but not about theoretical progress in urban economics. If Krugman’s model is true, however, there is a possibility that rural traffic infrastructure investment for the purpose of redistribution will experience both a decline in rural areas and agglomeration into urban areas. In the following, we will examine general theory about how we should observe the effect of traffic network provision in section II. We will estimate a market potential function and an index with which the geographical concentration degree is measured, and see how the agglomeration degree has changed historically. In section II we will conduct analysis through using prefecture data and municipal data, particularly in the Kyushu district 2. capital development, potential function, geographical concentration degree, Kyushu district, Japan, public policy, network effect...|$|R

The pipeline allows users with minimal computational/bioinformatic skills {{to set up and}} run an NGS analysis on their own samples, in less than an afternoon, on any operating system (Windows, iOS or Linux) or infrastructure (workstation, cluster or cloud). NGS pipelines typically utilize a large and varied range of software components and incur a substantial configuration burden during deployment which limits their portability to different computational environments. NGSeasy simplifies this by providing the pipeline components encapsulated in Docker™ containers and bundles in a wide choice of tools for each module. Each module of the pipeline represents one functional grouping of tools (e. g. sequence alignment, variant calling etc.). Deploying the pipeline is as simple as pulling the container images from the public repository into any host running Docker.

30|$|In {{order to}} depict the {{financial}} leeway of a company, several models include budgets that are considered in isolation and must be managed so as {{to ensure that they}} are not exceeded. For example, Kouvelis and Rosenblatt (2002) develop a quantitative model for global supply chains and maximize the net present value (NPV) of cash flows, i.e., before-tax income, interest payments, depreciation expenses, loan payments and corporate income taxes. A discounting rate for each country and period is given. They distinguish between investments in distribution centers and subassembly plants. For financing, budget restrictions provide loans granted by the government. There are country-specific per-period interest rates on the loans. Moreover, cash expenditures in fixed assets that are not financed by external sources are included. Wilhelm et al. (2005) optimize the strategic design of an assembly system in an international business environment. The objective is to maximize the total after-tax profit, while facilities (including locations, technologies and capacities) are chosen, suppliers are selected, distribution centers are located, and transportation modes are planned. The model contains a budget limitation assuring that total fixed costs associated with prescribing facilities and transportation modes for specific end products do not exceed a given amount of money. Chakravarty (2005) propose a model for optimizing plant investment decisions. In this context, they decide on where and how much to invest, what quantities to produce, which products to absorb the <b>investment</b> <b>overhead,</b> what product amounts to export and how to price the products. The considered company maximizes its profits over the planning horizon. The author assumes that the company has a fixed sum available for investment in plants {{at the beginning of the}} planning horizon. Fleischmann et al. (2006) develop a strategic planning model to optimize the global production network of an automobile manufacturer. In particular, they consider the allocation of products to production sites over a 12 -year planning horizon. The financial impact of physical investments on the cash flows is taken into account in an extended model with an objective function that minimizes the NPV of costs and investment expenditures. Due to the company’s self-financing strategy, yearly investment budgets that are estimated for the whole planning horizon by the yearly cash flows are used.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Agricultural EconomicsKevin DhuyvetterThis {{research}} analyzes how crop farms {{can achieve}} a higher net income per acre than other operations by farming fundamentally differently than others. There are many {{factors that are}} important to the long-term viability of today’s crop operations, one of which is how farms profitability compares with other operations. This determines farms’ ability to compete for land, outlast other operations through periods of unprofitability, and produce crops at long run equilibrium prices. These factors are relevant in today’s crop production industry where farms sit on a segment of the agribusiness supply chain. Therefore, in the interest of providing farms relevant information to manage their operations, this research analyzes how farms can distinguish their performance from other operations by accessing land and equipment resources, production practices for growing crops, and focusing their management efforts differently than other operations. There are three parts to this analysis. First, farms are broken down by characteristics, practices, and management performances. Then an econometric analysis quantifies the integrated correlation between farms’ distinguished characteristics, practices, and management performances and their distinguished net incomes per acre. Next a standard deviation analysis measures the degree to which farms are capable of distinguishing particular characteristics, practices, and management performances from other operations. Lastly, the performance of farms over the 2001 to 2010 time period is used to quantify how feasible it is for farms to maintain particular differences from other operations. Data used in this analysis were provided by the Kansas Farm Management Association, Kansas State University’s Department of Agricultural Economics, and Kansas’s National Agricultural Statistics Service office. The results suggest the way farms distinguish their characteristics, practices, and management performances from other operations impacts how their net income compares to other operations. The econometric analysis found that relative farm size, share of rented acres, the value of <b>overhead</b> and equipment <b>investment</b> per acre, government payments, planting intensity, risk, and cost, yield, and price management performances were all significantly related to farms’ relative net income. In regards to farms’ comparative profitability, this suggests farms should be aware of how their characteristics, practices, and management performances compare to other operations. The results also suggest the degree to which and the consistency with which farms can distinguish particular characteristics, practices, and management performances are different from one another. Over the 2001 to 2010 period, Kansas farms distinguished their characteristics from other operations to a larger degree than they distinguished their practices and management performances. Farms also maintained differences in their characteristics more consistently than they maintained differences in their practices and management performances. This suggests farms that are actively seeking to distinguish their net income per acre from other operations {{should be aware of the}} degree and consistency with which they can maintain particular differences from other operations...|$|R
