40|$|Purpose The {{factors that}} {{distinguish}} adolescent {{male and female}} substance abusers with and without legal problems were investigated. Method Youths (NÂ =Â  4, 071) admitted for <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> treatment were administered the revised Drug Use Screening Inventory (DUSI-R) to measure severity of health, behavior, and social adjustment problems. Results Legal problems were more frequent among boys; however, severity of disturbance was greater in girls on 9 <b>of</b> 10 scales. <b>Substance</b> <b>abusing</b> girls and boys with legal problems reported more severe behavior, <b>substance</b> <b>abuse,</b> family adjustment, and peer relationship problems than <b>substance</b> <b>abusing</b> peers without legal problems. Quality of peer relationship mediated the association <b>of</b> family dysfunction, <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> and behavior problems with legal problems in boys only. Conclusions Gender and legal status both {{need to be taken}} into account to potentiate treatment prognosis <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>abusing</b> youths. ...|$|R

50|$|The Office <b>of</b> Alcoholism and <b>Substance</b> <b>Abuse</b> was {{transferred}} from the New York State Department of Health to the Department of Mental Hygiene in 1962. In 1978, the Department of Mental Hygiene was reorganized into the autonomous Office <b>of</b> Alcoholism and <b>Substance</b> <b>Abuse,</b> Office <b>of</b> Mental Health (OMH), and the Office of the Mental Retarded and the Developmentally Disabled (OMRDD). These three offices are headed up by a Commissioner who also serves on a council that performs inter-office coordination. The OMRDD is now the Office for People With Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD). The Office <b>of</b> Alcoholism and <b>Substance</b> <b>Abuse</b> is now the Office <b>of</b> Alcoholism and <b>Substance</b> <b>Abuse</b> Services (OASAS).|$|R
5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the initial treatment for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>abuse.</b> The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E

40|$|Objectives This study aims at {{examining}} {{policy and}} practice within the Swedish school setting pertaining to children <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>abusing</b> parents/caregivers. Methods A cross-sectional survey, involving {{a representative sample of}} randomized schools (nÂ =Â  443) throughout Sweden was conducted using a self-completed questionnaire. Descriptive analysis was performed including bivariate analysis combined with logistic regression modeling to examine possible correlates between variables. Results The response rate was 66 %, and participants reported that 37 % had been trained in issues related to children <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>abusing</b> parents, 33 % of the schools had a policy document, and 73 % of the schools had identified students with this complex of problems. Whether or not schools identify these students depends upon the occurrence of schools being "compulsory" or "upper secondary", "public" or "independent", the "school size", and respondents' participation in further training, which in turn is associated with the presence of a policy document. Conclusions It appears as if a policy document does not directly predict whether schools identify students having <b>substance</b> <b>abusing</b> parents. However, it does influence whether respondents have participated in further training, which subsequently predicts the identification <b>of</b> students having <b>substance</b> <b>abusing</b> parents. Implications for {{policy and practice}} within the school setting are discussed. Adolescent School Children of impaired parents Policy <b>Substance</b> <b>abuse...</b>|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, {{the trait}} {{negative}} urgency, the propensity {{to engage in}} risky behaviour in response to distress, is highly predictive of certain aspects <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> in adolescents.

25|$|A growing {{literature}} is demonstrating {{the importance of}} emotion regulation in the treatment <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>abuse.</b> Considering that nicotine and other psychoactive substances such as cocaine activate similar psychopharmacological pathways, an emotion regulation approach may be applicable to a wide array <b>of</b> <b>substance</b> <b>abuse.</b> Proposed models of affect-driven tobacco use have focused on negative reinforcement as the primary driving force for addiction; according to such theories, tobacco is used because it helps one escape from the undesirable effects of nicotine withdrawal or other negative moods. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), is showing evidence that it is effective in treating substance abuse, including the treatment of poly-substance abuse and cigarette smoking. Mindfulness programs that encourage patients {{to be aware of}} their own experiences in the present moment and of emotions that arise from thoughts, appear to prevent impulsive/compulsive responses. Research also indicates that mindfulness programs can reduce the consumption of substances such as alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, marijuana, cigarettes and opiates.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{perceptions}} by {{the public}} and media that people with mental disorders released into the community {{are more likely to}} be dangerous and violent, a large study indicated that those without substance abuse symptoms are no more likely to commit violence than others without substance abuse symptoms in their neighborhoods, which were usually economically deprived and high in substance abuse and crime.

Results indicated that 61 % of the sample experienced or had a history that warranted suspicion of past and/or current maltreatment. Physical abuse was the most frequent form of maltreatment, followed by sexual abuse and neglect. Thirty-seven percent of patients experienced multiple forms of maltreatment. Maltreated patients had significantly more hospitalizations than their nonmaltreated counterparts on the same unit. Moreover, the age of maltreated patients was significantly lower than nonmaltreated patients, perhaps indicating an earlier age of onset of psychiatric illness and/or <b>substance</b> <b>abuse.</b> Analyses <b>of</b> parental <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> and psychiatric history among the maltreated and nonmaltreated groups revealed no significant findings. Results are discussed in terms of the following: (1) increased risk <b>of</b> subsequent <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> in maltreated children; (2) need for systematic assessment of child maltreatment in psychological or psychiatric evaluations; and (3) importance of treatment to deal with abuse or neglect as part <b>of</b> a comprehensive <b>substance</b> <b>abuse</b> intervention strategy...|$|R
