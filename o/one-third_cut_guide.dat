5000|$|The Bristol Freighter's main {{drawback}} was {{its limited}} payload, {{in terms of}} the number of cars that fitted into a single aircraft. Even the [...] "long-nosed" [...] Mark 32 was able to accommodate only three cars (in addition to 20 passengers). This made carrying cars by air a very tricky business. If a booked car failed to turn up, the flight instantly became unprofitable as a result of the <b>one-third</b> <b>cut</b> in payload. This situation was made worse by the increasing average length of British cars during the 1950s. The average UK car in 1959 was 25 cm longer than in 1950. The extreme seasonality of the car ferry business furthermore resulted in poor aircraft utilization outside peak periods. Moreover, repeated takeoffs and landings on short cross-Channel flights, in turbulent air at lower altitudes with tight turnarounds of as little as 20 minutes, made the aircraft prone to structural fatigue problems. These necessitated rigorous and costly modification programmes, thereby further increasing the type's operating costs on what were essentially low-yield routes.|$|R

The Texas Legislature, meeting in a special session in April and May, 2006, passed legislation that met the court's requirements that local districts have [...] "meaningful discretion" [...] in setting tax rates. A series of bills changed the school finance system to cut school M&O property taxes by one-third by 2008, but allowed local school boards to increase tax rates from the new, lower levels, although generally only with voter approval.

30|$|Recently, {{there have}} been several reports of cutting guides used in {{genioplasty}} of the mandible [4, 6, 7]. These guides confer several advantages. First, the form and position of the osteotomy line can be adjusted in simulated surgery, which allows the osteotomy line to be preoperatively planned, minimizing the possibility of dental or neural damage. Moreover, using a cutting guide allows the surgeon to adjust the depth when cutting, leading to a non-invasive and stable osteotomy. <b>Cutting</b> <b>guides</b> also make orthognathic surgeries easier by allowing the bone segments to be moved to the planned positions, according to the design of the guide. In a recent multicenter study, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) was used to measure the results of orthognathic surgeries using computer-aided surgical simulations (CASS) [9]. Significantly fewer errors were found for genioplasty when surgical guides were used, which led to more favorable surgical outcomes; the largest positional RMSD was 1.0  mm, and the largest orientation RMSD was 2.2 °. When a surgical guide was not used, the outcomes varied [9].|$|R

40|$|Background: Computer-aided {{design and}} {{computer-assisted}} manufacturing (CAD/CAM) of cutting guides {{are now being}} used in mandibular reconstruction with fibular bone flaps. Improvements in guide design and accuracy are needed to increase the benefits to patients. <b>Cutting</b> <b>guides</b> have become popular, but fixation guides are rarely considered. Materials and methods: The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether using a fixation guide would contribute to better accuracy in mandibular reconstruction. Mandibular segmental osteotomies and fibular reconstructions were performed using model surgery. Models were divided into two groups: without or with a fixation guide (n =  13 for each group). After reconstruction, the distances between reference points such as the condylion laterale (Cl), gonion, and mental tubercle (T) were measured and compared with those of the preoperative virtual plan. Deviations in final positions between the two groups were analyzed. Results: The mean deviations were 2. 61  mm (range 0. 05 – 7. 65  mm) and 2. 05  mm (range 0. 07 – 8. 52  mm) in the groups without and with a fixation guide, respectively. The overall results were significantly better when a fixation guide was used (p =  0. 03). Distances including the Cl reference points such as ClCl (p =  0. 02) and Cl–T (p =  0. 001) were particularly improved. Conclusions: Using a fixation guide together with a cutting guide makes mandibular reconstruction more accurate, particularly for positioning the Cl reference points. Therefore, when a CAD/CAM-produced cutting guide is used in preparation for surgery, it is recommended to use a fixation guide as well for more accuracy...|$|R

[...] Cook claims prisons are overcrowded and understaffed due to Chris Grayling (formerly in charge of the Ministry of Justice) closing prisons, closing prison wings and cutting prison staff. [...] There is concern that not enough is being done to prevent suicides among vulnerable women prisoners. Nigel Newcomen, Prisons and Probation Ombudsman said, “I find it disheartening that many of the lessons we identify to prevent women in custody from taking their own lives repeat those in previous publications from my office. This suggests it is not knowledge that is the issue, but a lack of concerted and sustained action.” Suicides among women prisoners have risen, there was good care from some prison staff but there were, “weak practice” and “basic failings”. There was also lack of coordination between mental health services and prison staff. Self-harm was sometimes punished. Prison suicides in 2016 at 119 were the highest since records began. This is the highest number since 1978. Professor Pamela Taylor of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' forensic faculty, said that the prison estates' mental health teams were understaffed and struggling to help prisoners in [...] "desperate need". [...] Royal College of Psychiatrists (RCP) research revealed prison psychiatrists are so frightened many cannot give basic care. There are assaults on psychiatrists and as many as 30 healthcare appointments daily are cancelled in some prisons due to lack of prison officers to escort staff between cells and clinics. Large scale resignations of psychiatrists are feared mainly due to safety concerns as in some prisons there will be only one staff member to 50 inmates.|$|R

The aim is to maximize the unit fleet availability over a multi-period planning horizon, while also ensuring that certain flight and maintenance requirements are satisfied. Heuristic approaches that are used in practice to solve the FMP problem often perform poorly, generating solutions that are far from the optimum. On the other hand, the exact optimization models that have been developed to tackle the problem handle small problems effectively, but tend to be computationally inefficient for larger problems, such as the ones that arise in practice. With these in mind, we develop an exact solution algorithm for the FMP problem, which is capable of identifying the optimal solution of considerably large realistic problems in reasonable computational times. The algorithm solves suitable relaxations of the original problem, utilizing valid <b>cuts</b> that <b>guide</b> the search towards the optimal solution. We present extensive experimental results, which demonstrate that the algorithm's performance on realistic problems is superior to that of two popular commercial optimization software packages, whereas the opposite is true for a class of problems with special characteristics that deviate considerably from those of realistic problems. The important conclusion of this research is that the proposed algorithm, complemented by generic optimization software, can handle effectively a large variety of FMP problem instances.

Two of the sailors then swam across the river with a towline attached to the explosive devices and then hauled them across. The torpedoes were then joined together by a bridle, and one of the sailors guided them down toward the ram hoping to place the bridle across her prow with a torpedo making contact with either side of her hull. He was then to swim clear before another man stationed across the river detonated the torpedoes electrically.

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the solution of}} variational inequalities (VIs) with analytic center cutting plane methods (ACCPMs). A convex feasibility problem reformulation of the variational inequality is used; this reformulation applies to VIs defined with pseudo-monotone, single-valued mappings or with maximal monotone, multi-valued mappings. Two cutting plane methods are presented: the first is based on linear cuts while the second uses quadratic cuts. The first method, ACCPM-VI (linear cuts), requires mapping evaluations but no Jacobian evaluations; in fact, no differentiability assumption is needed. The cuts are placed at approximate analytic centers that are tracked with infeasible primal-dual Newton steps. Linear equality constraints may {{be present in the}} definition of the VI's set of reference, and are treated explicitly. The set of reference is assumed to be polyhedral, or is convex and iteratively approximated by polyhedra. Alongside of the sequence of analytic centers, another sequence of points is generated, based on convex combinations of the analytic centers. This latter sequence is observed to converge to a solution much faster than the former sequence. The second method, ACCPM-VI (quadratic cuts), has cuts based on both mapping evaluations and Jacobian evaluations. The use of such a richer information set allows <b>cuts</b> that <b>guide</b> more accurately the sequence of analytic centers towards a solution. Mappings are assumed to be strongly monotone. However, Jacobian approximations, relying only on mapping evaluations, are observed to work very well in practice, so that differentiability of the mappings may not be required. There are two versions of the ACCPM-VI (quadratic cuts), that differ in the way a new analytic center is reached after the introduction of a cut. One version uses a curvilinear search followed by dual Newton centering steps. The search entails a full eigenvector-eigenvalue decomposition of a dense matrix of the order of the number of variables. The other version uses two line searches, primal-dual Newton steps, but no eigenvector-eigenvalue decomposition. The algorithms described in this thesis were implemented in the M ATLAB environment.
