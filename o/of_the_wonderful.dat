5|$|Alfred Hitchcock made a low-budget biographical film of Strauss in 1933 called Waltzes from Vienna. After {{a trip to}} Vienna, Walt Disney was {{inspired}} to create four feature films. One of those was The Waltz King, a loosely adapted biopic of Johann Strauss, which aired as part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wonderful</b> World of Disney in the U.S. in 1963. In Mikhail Bulgakov's 1940 (published 1967) novel, The Master and Margarita, Johann Strauss conducts the orchestra during Satan's Great Ball {{at the invitation of}} Behemoth.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} {{logarithm}} in seventeenth century Europe is {{the discovery of}} a new function that extended the realm of analysis beyond the scope of algebraic methods. The method of logarithms was publicly propounded by John Napier in 1614, in a book titled Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio (Description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wonderful</b> Rule of Logarithms). Prior to Napier's invention, there had been other techniques of similar scopes, such as the prosthaphaeresis or the use of tables of progressions, extensively developed by Jost Bürgi around 1600.|$|E
5|$|However, in 2012, PlatinumGames {{announced}} the development <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wonderful</b> 101, {{then known as}} Project P-100. This was the first project that reunited Kamiya and Inaba as director and producer on a title since {{the development of the}} Viewtiful Joe series. Furthermore, The Wonderful 101 uses the same tokusatsu thematics of the Viewtiful Joe series, and the two share a similar art style albeit different gameplay. This has led fans to hail The Wonderful 101 as a spiritual successor of sorts. The franchise would also later be featured in Archie Comics' Worlds Unite crossover with several other Capcom and Sega series, taking place in the Sonic the Hedgehog and Mega Man comics.|$|E

Some of these have been controversial, such as a series of prequels by Dave Barry and Ridley Pearson, and Lost Girls, a sexually explicit graphic novel by Alan Moore and Melinda Gebbie, featuring Wendy Darling and the heroines <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wonderful</b> Wizard of Oz and Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.|$|E

After Dorothy's house crushes the Wicked Witch of the East, thereby liberating the Munchkins from bondage, the Good Witch of the North tells Dorothy that she (the Witch of the North) is not as powerful as the Wicked Witch of the East had been, or she would have freed the Munchkins herself.|$|E

There is some evidence that a living pig-faced woman was exhibited at Bartholomew Fair in 1828, and possibly also in previous years. (The pig-faced woman exhibited in Wakefield in 1828–29, recalled by George Lloyd in 1861, may have been the same one shown at Bartholomew Fair in 1828.)

500|$|The {{same year}} {{also saw the}} release of PlatinumGames' second game, The Wonderful 101 for the eighth {{generation}} of video game consoles, the Wii U. While Kamiya was the game's director, Minami offered creative advice. According to Kamiya, inspiration was drawn from classic tokusatsu series like Power Rangers, and that the game was designed to appeal to all types of audiences. The game was originally planned for the Wii, and was set to feature classic Nintendo characters. However, as the team {{found that it was}} difficult to use these characters creatively, the game was put on hold temporarily. Its development was restarted later, with 50 original characters being featured in the final game. Nintendo also provided feedback during the game's development hoping that it would reach a larger audience. The game received critical acclaim. It was considered one of the best games in the Wii U library, and was voted one of [...] community's Nintendo favorites. However, the game underperformed in Japan, and was outsold by Pikmin 3, which had already been released before the launch <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Wonderful</b> 101.

The name Opposing Force has a double meaning, referring both {{to the fact that the}} player is now one of the enemies in the original game, as well as to Newton's third law of motion. In a later interview, Pitchford stated that he believed that Valve Software offered Gearbox the chance to make a Half-Life expansion was from a wish [...] "to focus on their future titles". In addition, Pitchford commented that Valve and Gearbox had agreed not to [...] "severely modify" [...] the game engine used by Half-Life and Opposing Force as it [...] "risks breaking all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wonderful</b> work" [...] that the game's custom content community was creating.
