30|$|With {{regard to}} the {{association}} of IGF-I and IGFBP 3 with cognition, Kalmijn et al. (Kalmijn et al. 2000) have disclosed that total IGF-I and total IGF-I/IGFBP 3 molar ratio are negatively associated with cognitive decline. A further transverse study has also reported an association between free IGF-I, IGFBP 3, and cognitive impairment among community-living elderly subjects, after adjusting for numerous potential confounders (age, sex, education, cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, depression, Parkinson’s disease, thyroid disease, smoking status, alcohol abuse, BMI, and number of medications) (Landi et al. 2007). In the present study, the circulating levels of IGF- 1 (total IGF- 1) and the ratio of IGF- 1 /IGBP 3, indicative of bioavailability of IGF- 1 significantly decreased and circulating IGFBP 3 level significantly increased after surgery under general anesthesia, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>orther</b> <b>hand,</b> IGF- 1 levels and ratios were all significantly lower in POCD group than in non-POCD group at different times, whereas {{there was no significant}} difference in level of IGFBP 3 between the patients with or without POCD. Further analysis showed that preoperative level of IGF- 1 (total IGF- 1) was independently, significantly associated with POCD, and lower preoperational circulating IGF- 1 level (total IGF- 1) increased the risk of POCD, but IGFBP 3 and molar ratio were not significant determinants of POCD. Thus, it was the preoperative circulating level of IGF- 1, and not IGFBP 3 or their molar ratio, that negatively correlated with POCD in the present study, which suggested that preoperative circulating level independently affected the incidence of POCD. We showed that the relationship of IGF- 1, IGFBP 3, molar ratio of IGF- 1 /IGFBP 3 and POCD was not the same as their relationship with AD. The probable reason was that POCD was caused by the operation, anesthesia, and other relevant factors, whereas AD is a primary neurodegenerative disorder in the elderly population. There are some differences in their pathophysiological mechanism. Operation, anesthesia or other relevant factors down-regulated the circulating IGF- 1 level [maybe inhibited the synthesis of IGF- 1 in liver based on the previous report that it is mainly produced in the liver, and can enter the brain via the blood–brain barrier (Creyghton et al. 2004)], then decreased the amount of IGF- 1 entering to brain through the blood–brain barrier. Decrease of IGF- 1 in brain leaded to attenuate ILPs function, increase of Aβ level in the brain and tau hyperphosphorylation and decrease of microtubule binding of tau, ultimately impaired cognitive function. However, this hypothesis is needed to be proved in the future researches.|$|E

40|$|Background : Tuberculosis (TB) {{is still}} a major problem {{worldwide}} (WHO, 2010). One third of the world population are infected by Mycobacterium Tuberculosis. Approximately 9 million of new cases are identified and 2 – 2 million people died because of this desease every year. WHO in an annual report on Global TB Control 2009 stated that Indonesia is the third {{country in the world}} with tuberculosis problem after India and China. Tuberculosis is a communicable infection desase that causes many death amongst all age. Up to present the tuberculosis rehabilitation program in Indonesia is still far away from expected outcomes, as same as in Palembang. One of the main cause is high rate of incompliance to treatment. Thereore, the compliance to treatment is the most priority. Method : The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine variables influence the compliance of tuberculosis patients to treatment in Indonesia. The study took place in 36 public health center locations in Palembang City.

The presence of monopoly unions introduces real wage rigidity in the model and this im-plies a trade-o ¤ between output stabilization and ination stabilization i. e., as in Blanchard and Galì (2005), the so called divine coincidence does not hold. We show that the negative e¤ect of a productivity shock <b>on</b> ination and <b>the</b> positive e¤ect of a cost-push shock is crucially deter-mined by the proportion of 8 ̆ 5 rms that belong to the competitive sector.
