5|$|Krueger {{accepted}} {{reports of}} a Japanese counterattack at Saidor, and sent reinforcements in response, but the attack did not eventuate. Because the 32nd Infantry Division was required for the upcoming Hansa Bay operation, he was initially reluctant to authorize it to block the trails behind the American beachhead. When he finally did so, it was too late. The retreating Japanese made good their escape, thereby defeating {{the whole purpose of}} the operation. The next operation, the Admiralty Islands campaign in February 1944, played <b>out</b> <b>differently.</b> Based on Fifth Air Force reports that the islands were unoccupied, MacArthur accelerated his timetable and ordered an immediate reconnaissance in force of the islands. Krueger sent in the Alamo Scouts, who confirmed that the islands were still well-defended.|$|E
5|$|Izumi {{suggests}} {{that in the first}} six days, Makoto had been deceived by her and Okuhiko, but rather than believing in premonitions had believed he had traveled back in time. When Izumi died on April 6, and Makoto had desired to travel back in time, Curé Syndrome manifested. She {{suggests that}} while he had thought that he was traveling back in time, he had only imagined a different past where events played <b>out</b> <b>differently,</b> as part of a delusion, and that he had given himself partial memories in the form of premonitions in each loop; in the last loop, he would have given himself all his memories, other than the knowledge that he is experiencing a delusion. She says that once Makoto succeeds in saving her, he will break out of the delusion, and the six days in his delusion will become reality. Makoto refuses to believe her, claiming that everything around him is reality, but starts to doubt throughout the week. Depending on the player's choices, the route branches into two endings. In one, the delusions appear to be changing reality, but are revealed to be a chain of coincidences. In the other, the delusions do change reality, and Makoto wakes up {{at the bottom of the}} cliff he fell down at the end of the last loop, badly wounded from having protected Izumi during the fall. It is left ambiguous as to what is real and what is a delusion, and whether Makoto has escaped to reality or still is trapped in his delusion.|$|E

5|$|The {{longevity}} of Augustus' reign and its legacy to the Roman world {{should not be}} overlooked as {{a key factor in}} its success. As Tacitus wrote, the younger generations alive in AD 14 had never known any form of government other than the Principate. Had Augustus died earlier (in 23BC, for instance), matters might have turned <b>out</b> <b>differently.</b> The attrition of the civil wars on the old Republican oligarchy and the {{longevity of}} Augustus, therefore, must be seen as major contributing factors in the transformation of the Roman state into a de facto monarchy in these years. Augustus' own experience, his patience, his tact, and his political acumen also played their parts. He directed the future of the Empire down many lasting paths, from the existence of a standing professional army stationed at or near the frontiers, to the dynastic principle so often employed in the imperial succession, to the embellishment of the capital at the emperor's expense. Augustus' ultimate legacy was the peace and prosperity the Empire enjoyed for the next two centuries under the system he initiated. His memory was enshrined in the political ethos of the Imperial age as a paradigm of the good emperor. Every Emperor of Rome adopted his name, Caesar Augustus, which gradually lost its character as a name and eventually became a title. The Augustan era poets Virgil and Horace praised Augustus as a defender of Rome, an upholder of moral justice, and an individual who bore the brunt of responsibility in maintaining the empire.|$|E

25|$|The Architectural {{gear ratio}} is {{explained}} through the segmented muscle model 3 proposed by Emanuel Azizi, where a muscle segment is shown {{as a single}} muscle fiber attached to the myosepta of a Siren lacertina an aquatic salamander at a certain acute, pennation angle. The model allows segments to bulge <b>out</b> <b>differently</b> in the horizontal, and vertical direction and was {{used to calculate the}} Architectural gear ratio of each segment. Preliminary models results show that with muscle bulging, the Architectural gear ratio will increase. Different bulging conditions were studied, and shown in Fig. 2 The model results show the more a muscle bulges in dorsoventral height, the further the muscle fibers shorten, therefore providing a higher Architectural gear ratio.|$|E

Superman and Lois live a happy and normal life, raising their daughter Lara, who eventually develop superpowers and with her father's guidance becomes a superhero of her own. Superman is eventually awakened from his slumber by Ares and is left feeling angrier and bitterer after realizing and living the life he could've had with Lois and their child. In Year Five, in an alternate world, Lois and Clark are shown happily visiting Clark's parents, telling them that she is pregnant.|$|E
25|$|Emotions play an {{important}} part in the negotiation process, although it is only in recent years that their effect is being studied. Emotions have the potential to play either a positive or negative role in negotiation. During negotiations, the decision {{as to whether or not}} to settle rests in part on emotional factors. Negative emotions can cause intense and even irrational behavior, and can cause conflicts to escalate and negotiations to break down, but may be instrumental in attaining concessions. On the other hand, positive emotions often facilitate reaching an agreement and help to maximize joint gains, but can also be instrumental in attaining concessions. Positive and negative discrete emotions can be strategically displayed to influence task and relational outcomes and may play <b>out</b> <b>differently</b> across cultural boundaries.|$|E

Mahesh later acknowledged the film's failure and called it a [...] "mistake". He added, [...] "We were very excited during the scripting stage, and had envisioned it very differently.

500|$|The {{character}} routes {{were divided}} between Takeshi and the Kid {{according to what}} made sense for the plot, rather than {{in an effort to}} pair up the player characters with specific female characters. Although the routes were given a recommended playing order, this did not occur until around the time the scenario was finished. According to Nakazawa, bad endings were painful to write, but were included both as foils to the good ending to increase the sense of accomplishment in reaching the good ending, and as [...] "what if?" [...] events that give the story variety, showing what would have happened had events played <b>out</b> <b>differently.</b> The game's epilogue was not originally planned, but was written by Uchikoshi in three days after being advised by Nakazawa. When a PlayStation Portable version was developed, Nakazawa was asked to create new content for it; as it would have been hard to expand the story or add new event computer graphics artwork (CGs), it was decided to create an in-game dictionary explaining terms used to allow players to enjoy the game on a deeper level.|$|E

[...] UGO also notes the potential Sega Channel could have had with some more development time in the field of competitive multiplayer, stating, [...] "If the Sega Channel had come a little earlier {{in the life of the}} Genesis it would have seen much more exposure, and maybe online play would have been feasible for games that could have been developed directly for the service." ...|$|E

500|$|For each mission, {{a player}} {{is given a}} {{briefing}} in regards to it, which details relevant information on what the mission is about, what to expect, and what objectives {{are expected to be}} completed, although not all actual situations and objectives are detailed. In between some missions, players are also given a command briefing, stating the current situation of the campaign, as well as information on any new ships and weapons being released for use. Before flying out on a mission, players can modify the ship and weapons load-outs for their own starfighter and those of their own wingmen and other wings for the mission; for some missions, the load-out is either fixed for the mission, or is whatever the player set up in the previous one, while what ships and weapons are available depend on the progress on the mission, with stronger weapons and ships becoming available only in later missions. The level of control over load-outs prior to committing to a mission adds an element of strategy to the campaign. The results of a mission can often affect how later missions play out; for example, an enemy capital ship allowed to flee in a particular mission may return in a later mission. Completing a mission and leaving when given authorisation, leads to a debriefing screen which outlays what was achieved by the player and any aspects that could have been done better; players can get a hint, defined as [...] "recommendations", to see what they could have done better, and can restart a mission to play the mission <b>out</b> <b>differently.</b> Player's can earn medals after some missions, either for completing a specific mission, or achieving certain hidden criteria/bonus objectives, receive promotions depending on the kills and types of alongside the difficulty being played at, and badges for overall total of kills made by them. Furthermore, players can replay any single player mission they complete through the in-game mission simulator.|$|E
