5|$|Numerous {{damaging}} leaks, {{which appeared}} to originate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attorneys, emerged. They included a confession {{said to have been}} inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> fair trial. A gag order was imposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from commenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, or opinions regarding the trial proceedings. The defense was allowed to enter into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Department report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of the agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had worked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence.|$|E

5|$|The couple moved {{repeatedly}} {{over the}} following year – first to Laguna Beach, California, then to Santa Catalina Island, California, New York City, Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania and ultimately to Hubbard's first wife's home at South Colby, Washington. Polly Hubbard had filed for divorce {{on the grounds of}} desertion and non-support, and was not even aware that Hubbard was living with Northrup, let alone that he had married her. The arrival of Hubbard and Northrup three weeks after the divorce was filed scandalized Hubbard's family, who deeply disapproved of his treatment of Polly. Northrup had no idea of Hubbard's first marriage or why people were treating her so strangely until his son L. Ron Hubbard Jr. told her that his parents were still married. She attempted to flee on a ferry but Hubbard caught up with her and convinced her to stay, saying {{that he was in the}} process <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> divorce and that an attorney had told him that the marriage with Northrup was legal. The couple moved to a rented trailer in North Hollywood in July 1947, where Hubbard spent much of his time writing stories for pulp magazines.|$|E

40|$|Background Increased use of anti-bacterials is {{associated}} with anti-bacterial resistance. In Norway, the total use of anti-bacterials is on the rise. Most of the anti-bacterials are prescribed by general practicians (GPs), mainly for respiratory tract infections (RTIs). Issues Based on data collected from GPs in Norway, we explored the hypothesis that there is <b>an</b> increased likelihood <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> anti-bacterial for RTIs on Fridays; that there is <b>an</b> increased likelihood <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> broader-spectrum anti-bacterials on Fridays; finally, that certain subgroups of patients or GPs, are more associated with Friday effects than others. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed. Factors that have proven to affect the odds <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> anti-bacterial in the same data material in a previous report were included to avoid confounding. Findings There was less than 10 percent variation across {{the days of the}} week in the odds <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> anti-bacterial for RTIs. Friday s odds were not statistically different from the odds of Monday through Wednesday, but about 10 percent higher than Thursday s looking at the entire data material. Mondays had the highest odds looking at GPs with an even workload-distribution through the week. The week did not affect the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> broader-spectrum anti-bacterials. There were no convincing Friday effects associated with specific age-groups of patients, or with specific subgroups of GPs. Interpretation The day of the week is <b>a</b> weak predictor <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> anti-bacterial for RTIs. In particular, we found no convincing Friday effect. Instead, there is a tendency that Mondays carry the highest odds looking at GPs with even workload-distribution through that week. This could suggest that the odds <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> <b>an</b> anti-bacterial increases with the length of the illness...|$|R
