50|$|The club {{played at}} several grounds on Clodgey Lane {{before moving to}} Beacon Park in 1949, a ground which had been built by German POWs shortly after World War II. In 1972 they moved to their current ground, Kellaway Park, also on the same road. The ground {{initially}} consisted of a rented pitch, before a wooden shed was built that also served as the clubhouse. A new clubhouse was built in 1988 and included a roof <b>overhang</b> for spectator <b>cover.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} the homes and cottage differ {{significantly}} from Victorian architecture of the era. The t-shape bungalow style incorporates horizontal design, rooms that flow from one into the next, natural materials and large glass windows throughout. The interior floors, walls and ceilings of the Charnley-Norwood House are constructed of local heart and curly pine, while the exterior walls are clad using wood shingles. To accommodate residents during the muggy and hot Mississippi summers, the home’s design efficiently utilizes large roof <b>overhangs</b> and <b>covered</b> porches at the south, west, and east sides of the house provide protection from the harsh, southern sun, while offering opportunities to enjoy the serene setting of the home. Numerous doors and operable windows are arranged along {{the exterior of the}} house to efficiently distribute both onshore and offshore breezes to cool the residence. Fireplaces located in each of the bedrooms, entry hall, and dining room supply warmth for the cooler winter temperatures.|$|R

Trees and a building are visible in the distance on the right...|$|R
50|$|The club {{played at}} several local grounds until {{moving to the}} Recreation Ground in 1947. The land had been donated to the village by Theodore Robinson during the 1980s. New {{changing}} rooms were built after the club joined the Somerset County League in 1970. A clubhouse was built during the club's early years in the Western League, which has some terracing in front of it. Floodlights were erected in 1993 alongside another set of new changing rooms, which included a roof <b>overhang</b> to provide <b>covered</b> accommodation for spectators. A stand was built during the 2003-04 season and named after Bill Coggins, a former club secretary.|$|R
50|$|The Pâquet House (Maison Pâquet) {{is located}} at 1630 Marie-Victorin Road, and was built around 1760. It {{is a good example}} of French vernacular architecture. A long-façaded (over 90 ft) building, it was {{enlarged}} twice, once on each side of the original building, during its history (though the dates are not known precisely, the last addition was made before 1850). The dimensions of the original building are still very visible as they are marked by the position of the two chimneys. This size is in part attributable to the various uses the house has had: at some point a general store was located inside. The house is built using pièce-sur-pièce techniques where notched logs are piled horizontally, and covered with vertical wood sidings, with low foundations (compared with buildings of the 19th century and later) and a tall roof. The ceiling lines are low, and a half-story is built under the roof, lit by straight gable-fronted dormer windows on two levels, with the higher dormers much smaller. The roof is straight, with little to no <b>overhang,</b> and <b>covered</b> in cedar shingles. All windows are divided in smaller square panes; those of the ground floor have external shutters. The original door was placed asymmetrically in regard to the building, and a carriage door is on the right side.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of an {{exterior}} view of E. C. Fisher's {{store on}} the west side of South Main Street, north of Washington Boulevard in Los Angeles, ca. 1890. The store is in a long single story building that reaches from the left of the image to the right. It has an <b>overhang</b> that <b>covers</b> a walkway in front of the large glass windows of the store. There are four men standing on this walkway, and there is a small amount of merchandise, including melons, wash tubs, and ropes, arranged in front as well. Legible signs include, from left to right, "Examiner sold here", "News Depot Stationery", "Tinware Hardware", "Staple & Fancy Groceries", "Produce Tea & Coffee", "Window glass Paintbrushes", "The Broad-Guage", "Ranch Eggs Wanted", and "Under we[ar] Notion[?]".; "Portrait of Fisher's Broad-Guage Department Store.

2500|$|The {{building}} sits at {{the southeast}} corner of Main and Second Streets. Originally, the building included 6 classrooms, 4 offices (principal's, secretary's, attendance, and main), and 2 restrooms. The central façade is flanked by two small wings, which protrude slightly towards Main Street, forming a small [...] "C" [...] shape. The foundation and walls are brick, which has since been stuccoed over. The windows were double-hung, three-over-three wood construction, in vertical proportion in groups of two to four with common sills. These have been replaced by aluminum windows, one-over-one single hung inserted into the original sash frames. Doors were originally [...] "wooden, single- light doors with multi-light transoms overhead", with most now replaced by modern units. Broad stairs led to the main entries in the front, back, and both sides, although the stairs on the south side were destroyed with the construction of the cafeteria addition. There are also several smaller sets of steps leading to the outside from minor entrances. The entrances are framed by pedimented parapets, which sit on pilasters. The roof has a low pitch with wide <b>overhangs,</b> and is <b>covered</b> with asbestos tiles in a diamond pattern.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} design, {{fabrication}} and characterization of robust and programmable superhydrophobic surfaces. The content {{is divided into}} two main categories. The first part is dedicated to fabrication of durable superhydrophobic surfaces and their performance characterization, including blood compatibility. The second part focuses on programmable superhydrophobic/superhydrophilic surfaces. A new fabrication process was introduced to produce durable superhydrophobic silicon surfaces, based on geometrical modification of the surface without any hydrophobic coating. The fabrication process is based on a combination of inductively coupled plasma-reactive ion etching (ICP-DRIE) and metal-assisted chemical etching (MaCE). Elimination of hydrophobic coating made the surface chemically and thermally robust, but due to use of silicon, the mechanical fragility issue remained. A biomimetic approach inspired by the exoskeleton of insects such as Armadillidium, was introduced to tackle the mechanical robustness. The new hybrid material consists of elastomeric <b>overhang</b> nanostructures <b>covered</b> by a thin layer of metal oxide. The elastomer part can bend and deform without breaking, while the hard metal oxide layer protects the surface from mechanical damage. We used atomic layer deposition (ALD) and replica moulding to produce such hybrid PDMS/titania surfaces. Our new fabrication process is based on sacrificial etching of the aluminum template and the transfer of titania film from the template to the PDMS. Subjecting the surfaces to a battery of mechanical, thermal, chemical and radiation tests demonstrated extremely durable superhydrophobicity. As an extension to replica moulding/sacrificial template process, we introduce a new way to make hydrophobic and hemophobic elastomeric tubes. The tubes showed a dramatic drag reduction for water and blood droplets compared to control tubes. A programmable superhydrophobic surface was introduced using hierarchical silicon micro and nanostructures covered by photo-switchable materials. Combination of ICP-DRIE and RIE were used to produce silicon T-shaped microstructures. Colloidal deposition was done to introduce nanoscale roughness. These structures were then conformally coated with photoactive titania using ALD. Fast and reversible transition of superhydrophobic to hydrophobic, hydrophilic and superhydrophilic state was demonstrated using UV-exposure and thermal annealing...|$|R
40|$|There {{is growing}} concern about more {{intensive}} runoff and environmental regulations for open beef cattle feedlots, {{particularly in the}} higher rainfall cattle feeding states like Iowa. A low-cost, versatile bedded hoop barn for feeding cattle may be a possible solution to this situation. The objective {{of this study is}} to quantify the environment in a bedded hoop used for finishing beef cattle and to compare beef cattle performance in hoops to conventional open feedlots. In order to compare bedded hoop barns to outside feedlots for beef cattle feeding, a hoop barn (50 x 120 ft) is being constructed at the ISU Armstrong Research Farm, Lewis, IA that will house 120 head of steers in three pens with approximately 50 square feet per animal. The hoop barn will have a fenceline feedbunk with concrete apron and scrape alley. The remaining floor will use crushed rock over geotextile fabric. Cornstalk bedding will be used to facilitate solid manure handling. Manure will be composted during the summer and winter months for land application in spring and fall. The hoop system will be compared with an outside feedlot with shed, under common management. Data will be collected and summarized on the following items: facility cost, feed intake, feed efficiency, cost of gain, daily gain, bedding use, manure output, and labor requirement. The project is being conducted in western Iowa, an area with many outside beef cattle feedlots. Design features and decisions included: a north-south orientation, 10 ft sidewalls, a fenceline bunk along the east edge of the hoop, a fabric <b>covered</b> <b>overhang</b> to shelter the fenceline bunk, three equal pens, a continuous open ridge vent, concrete paving along the bunks and for the scrape alley, and a curtain to close the west wall and north wall if needed. Results of this study will be ongoing, beginning in 2005...|$|R
