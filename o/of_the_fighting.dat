5|$|At some point, {{possibly}} {{around this}} time, Montagu was killed; {{he was certainly}} dead before his brother. The Arrivall chronicler states this occurred 'in plain battle,' and in the thick <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting,</b> {{rather than in the}} rout that later followed.|$|E
5|$|From October 1916 {{to the end}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> in November 1918, U-15s {{activities}} are unknown. U-15 was at Pola {{at the end of}} the war when Austria-Hungary handed her over to Italy. U-15 was scrapped at Pola by 1920.|$|E
5|$|In Jilib, the Islamists used bulldozers {{to prepare}} {{trenches}} and defensive positions. They had about 3,000 fighters and 60 technicals mounted with antiaircraft and antitank guns. Up to 4,700 people fled the area ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Panzerbeobachtungswagen IV (Pz.Beob.Wg.IV) was an {{artillery}} observation vehicle {{built on the}} Panzer IV chassis.

5|$|Allied {{planners}} began formulating {{their plans}} for the future direction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> in the wider Pacific with a focus upon retaking the Philippines and the eventual capture of the Japanese Home Islands. The lynchpin to Japanese strength in the region was their main base at Rabaul. The reduction of this base came {{to be seen as a}} key tenet of success in the SWPA for the Allies and was formalised into Operation Cartwheel.|$|E

5|$|By 16 December, the British 5th Division had {{completed}} its {{move into the}} line between the New Zealand and the Indian divisions. There followed a period of hostile patrolling and skirmishing on the XIII Corps front. The main burden <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> was therefore assumed by V Corps as the Canadians pushed for Ortona with the Indian Division on their left flank attacking toward Villa Grande and Tollo.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the sheer}} {{intensity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> {{and the number}} of Indonesian troops, final casualty numbers are placed at a surprisingly low 2 killed and 8 wounded on the British side. The British in turn inflicted at least 30 casualties upon the Indonesians, but an exact number cannot be determined.|$|E
5|$|Hitler was satisfied. The {{reasoning}} of the Luftwaffe seemed sound. Should {{the bombing}} achieve its aim, it offered considerable strategic value. The strike against London meant that most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> on 15 September {{would take place}} between Luftflotte 2 under Albert Kesselring and Keith Park’s No. 11 Group RAF.|$|E

5|$|In November, Herring flew {{across the}} {{mountains}} to take control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> around Buna, leaving Blamey to control operations elsewhere in New Guinea. Herring planned the systematic reduction of the Japanese positions at Buna and Sanananda. He struggled to amass enough troops, equipment, guns, and supplies to allow Australian troops under Vasey and Americans under Eichelberger to overcome the Japanese and capture the area.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the military personnel involved in the fighting, several Australian war correspondents reported on the Battle of Normandy. Chester Wilmot landed with the 6thAirborne Division on D-Day, and his coverage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> for the BBC soon {{made him one of}} the best-known Allied war correspondents. Other Australian journalists in Normandy included John Hetherington, Geoff Hutton and Ronald Monson.|$|E
5|$|In all 416,806 Australians {{enlisted in}} the AIF {{during the war and}} 333,000 served overseas. 61,508 were killed and another 155,000 were wounded (a total {{casualty}} rate of 65%). The financial cost to the Australian government was calculated at £376,993,052. Two referendums on conscription for overseas service had been defeated during the war, preserving the volunteer status of the Australian force, but stretching the reserves of manpower available, particularly towards the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting.</b> Consequently, Australia remained one of only two armies on either side not to resort to conscription during the war.|$|E

5|$|In {{the course}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> the Australian Army {{sustained}} approximately 61,000 battle casualties, {{the bulk of}} them from the Second AIF. This included 11,323 killed in action, 1,794 died of wounds, and 21,853 wounded. 5,558 were killed or died in captivity, while another 20,920 survived as prisoners of war. Non-battle casualties included 1,088 killed and 33,196 wounded/injured in operational areas, and another 1,795 killed and 121,800 wounded/injured in non-operational areas. The large number of non-battle casualties was significant, illustrating the toll that sickness and disease took upon the Army.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> that James Llewellyn Davies earned the Victoria Cross (VC). Davies, alone, {{attacked}} a German machine gun position after previously failed efforts had resulted in numerous British deaths. He killed one German and captured another {{as well as the}} gun. Although he was wounded, he then led an attack to kill a sniper who had been harassing his unit. Davies subsequently died of his wounds.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on Hill 677 the Canadians {{had spent}} the night of 23/24 April in their pits {{listening}} to the sounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> on the Australian front. However, by early morning Chinese activity increased and, with the situation deteriorating on the Patricia's right flank, Stone withdrew B Company from their position forward of the feature's summit to strengthen this flank if the Australians were forced to withdraw. Under the command of Major Vince Lilley the company subsequently moved to occupy positions east of Battalion Headquarters on the high ground overlooking the valley road.|$|E

5|$|On December 19, as the {{intensity}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> increased, Croatia won its first diplomatic recognition by a western nation—Iceland—while the Serbian Autonomous Oblasts in Krajina and western Slavonia officially declared themselves the Republic of Serbian Krajina. Four days later, Germany recognized Croatian independence. On December 26, 1991, the Serb-dominated federal presidency {{announced plans for}} a smaller Yugoslavia that could include the territory captured from Croatia during the war.|$|E
5|$|On its way home, the battalion– {{along with}} the 16th Brigade {{and the rest of}} the 17th Brigade– was landed on Ceylon due to the {{perceived}} threat of a Japanese invasion there. The battalion remained there for five months, constructing defences and conducting jungle training at various locations including Lake Koggala, Weligama, Matara, Tangalle and Hambantota. After the threat of invasion passed, the battalion eventually returned to Melbourne on the transport HMT Athlone Castle, arriving in early August 1942, at the height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fighting</b> along the Kokoda Track in Papua.|$|E
