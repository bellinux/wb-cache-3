These also showed that the brolga is more closely related to the white-naped crane than it is to the morphologically more similar sarus crane.|$|E

Mapping ST,Inc maps two fuzzy sets A and B to a fuzzy set ST,Inc(A,B) in X called their fuzzy set <b>of</b> <b>similarity.</b> A measure <b>of</b> <b>similarity</b> between A and B is then obtained by applying the composite of fuzzy measure and fuzzy similarity mapping on the pair (A,B).

5|$|Several {{invertebrate}} {{systems are}} considered acceptable alternatives to vertebrates in early-stage discovery screens. Because <b>of</b> <b>similarities</b> between the {{innate immune system}} of insects and mammals, insects can replace mammals in some types of studies. Drosophila melanogaster and the Galleria mellonella waxworm have been particularly important for analysis of virulence traits of mammalian pathogens. Waxworms and other insects have also proven valuable for the identification of pharmaceutical compounds with favorable bioavailability. The decision to adopt such models generally involves accepting a lower degree of biological similarity with mammals for significant gains in experimental throughput.|$|E
5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of viruses by naming and grouping them on the basis <b>of</b> <b>similarities.</b> In 1962, André Lwoff, Robert Horne, and Paul Tournier {{were the first to}} develop a means of virus classification, based on the Linnaean hierarchical system. This system bases classification on phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species. Viruses were grouped according to their shared properties (not those of their hosts) and the type of nucleic acid forming their genomes. Later the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses was formed. However, viruses are not classified on the basis of phylum or class, as their small genome size and high rate of mutation makes it difficult to determine their ancestry beyond order. As such, the Baltimore classification is used to supplement the more traditional hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} {{has been}} noted to often co-occur with Amanita muscaria or A.rubescens, although {{it is unclear whether}} this is due to a biological association between the species, or because <b>of</b> <b>similarities</b> in growing season, habitat, and ecological requirements. An association has also been reported between B.edulis and Amanita excelsa on Pinus radiata ectomycorrhizae in New Zealand, suggesting that other fungi may influence the life cycle of porcini. A 2007 field study revealed little correlation between the abundance of fruit bodies and presence of its mycelia below ground, even when soil samples were taken from directly beneath the mushroom; the study concluded that the triggers leading to formation of mycorrhizae and production of the fruit bodies were more complex.|$|E

Fuzzy concepts and fuzzy concept lattices represent a formal {{approach to the}} modelling of non-sharp (fuzzy) concepts and conceptual structures {{in the sense of}} traditional (Port-Royal) logic. Applications of concept lattices are in representation of conceptual knowledge and in conceptual analysis <b>of</b> (fuzzy) data. <b>Similarity</b> relations are defined and considered on three levels: <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> objects (and <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> attributes), <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> concepts, and <b>similarity</b> <b>of</b> concept lattices.

40|$|Abstract: Traditionally, {{similarity}} between two objects is calculated {{by using only}} their attribute values, such as number of coincided attributes, Euclid distance, etc. A new concept <b>of</b> <b>similarity</b> dealing with a uniqueness measure is proposed in this paper by which the {{similarity between}} two objects is not only considered using their attribute values, but also a subset of objects as an important parameter. Here, the subset of objects may be regarded as knowledge of human. In this concept <b>of</b> <b>similarity,</b> if attribute values of two objects are rare in the subset, and their attribute values are the same, then their degree <b>of</b> <b>similarity</b> is high. On the other hand, if the attribute values of two objects are not rare in the subset, and their attribute values are the same, then their degree <b>of</b> <b>similarity</b> is low. Consequently, the degree <b>of</b> <b>similarity</b> between two objects will be changed depending on the subset of objects. Moreover, we discuss mathematical properties of the concept <b>of</b> <b>similarity</b> dealing with uniqueness measure. Finally, we discuss differences between the concept <b>of</b> <b>similarity</b> based on uniqueness measure and traditional similarity using some examples...|$|R
5|$|Because many genes {{belonging}} to HLA remain unidentified, positional cloning (a method {{used to identify}} a specific gene, when only its location on a chromosome is known) {{has been used to}} determine that a mucin-like gene is associated with DPB. In addition, diseases caused by identified HLA genes in the DPB-susceptibility region have been investigated. One of these, bare lymphocyte syndrome I (BLS I), exhibits a number <b>of</b> <b>similarities</b> with DPB in those affected, including chronic sinusitis, bronchiolar inflammation and nodules, and the presence of H.influenzae. Also like DPB, BLS I responds favorably to erythromycin therapy by showing a resolution of symptoms. The similarities between these two diseases, the corresponding success with the same mode of treatment, {{and the fact that the}} gene responsible for BLS I is located within the DPB-causing area of HLA narrows the establishment of a gene responsible for DPB. Environmental factors such as inhaling toxic fumes and cigarette smoking are not believed to play a role in DPB, and unknown environmental and other non-genetic causessuch as unidentified bacteria or viruseshave not been ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Interviewed by Wallace, McHenry admits being angry after {{discovering}} his girlfriend's infidelity but denies {{that the blood}} on his clothing is hers. Montgomery tries to convince King to report her rape; King refuses, telling Montgomery {{that she does not}} understand {{what it is like to}} be raped. Wilder uses alternative medicine to help King deal with her pain. Psychiatrist Violet Turner (Amy Brenneman) refuses to talk to King about the rape because <b>of</b> <b>similarities</b> to the fetal abduction she experienced a year earlier, and wonders if everyone in the practice is cursed. Bennett wants to go home and rest, which angers Montgomery. King attempts to compose a memorandum saying that she was attacked on the hospital grounds, but Freedman suggests that another member of the staff do it for her; she shouts at Freedman when he calls her a victim. After the argument, Freedman goes to King's office and weeps when he sees the aftermath of her assault. McHenry admits raping a woman, assaulting Wallace before he is pulled away by the police. In the ambulance bay, Bennett expresses his confusion about Montgomery's mood swings and suspects that she is hiding something from him; Montgomery asks him to promise never to leave her alone. After Freedman helps her dress, King says that she loves him and wants to go home. McHenry is held by the police for assaulting a police officer during his arrest and Wallace during his interrogation, but detective Joe Price says that McHenry cannot be charged with rape until charges are filed against him. The episode ends with King walking out of the hospital with Freedman's help; flashbacks of the rape reveal that McHenry was the rapist.|$|E

Due to this system of presidency Swiss leaders, like those of the EU, are relatively unknown with national politics viewed as somewhat technocratic resulting in low voter turnout, in a similar fashion to that of the European Parliament. Other parallels include the jealously guarded powers of states, the considerable level of translation and the choice of a lesser city as the capital.|$|E
