25|$|Historically, local {{residents}} and preservation {{groups have been}} concerned about development in the Village and have fought to preserve its architectural and historic integrity. In the 1960s, Margot Gayle led a group of citizens to preserve the Jefferson Market Courthouse (later reused as Jefferson Market Library) while other citizen groups fought to keep traffic <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> Square Park, and Jane Jacobs, using the Village {{as an example of}} a vibrant urban community, advocated to keep it that way.|$|E
25|$|From 1789 {{until the}} 1930s, Congress convened in December, stayed in session {{for five or}} six months, and then adjourned sine die. Occasionally, the demands of war kept Congress in session longer, but {{generally}} senators agreed with Vice President John Nance Garner who famously proclaimed, “No good legislation ever comes <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> after June.” By the 1950s, however, the schedule had changed.

25|$|Dallas had {{the eighth}} {{pick in the}} 1985 NBA draft—again due to a trade with the Cavaliers—and drafted German-born forward Detlef Schrempf <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington.</b> He would show flashes of {{brilliance}} in his three-plus seasons with the team, {{but it was not}} until he was traded to the Indiana Pacers that he displayed his full potential. The Mavericks also traded center Kurt Nimphius to the Los Angeles Clippers for center James Donaldson, who would play for the Mavericks until halfway through the 1991–92 season. This allowed the Mavericks to have the steady hand at center that had been lacking throughout the franchise's first five years. In 1988, James Donaldson was the only All-Star center in Dallas Maverick history.|$|E

25|$|McClellan moved <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> {{with his}} 87,000-man army {{in a slow}} pursuit, {{reaching}} Frederick on September 13. There, two Union soldiers discovered a mislaid copy of the detailed campaign plans of Lee's army—General Order Number 191—wrapped around three cigars. The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically, thus making each subject to isolation and defeat in detail. McClellan waited 18 hours before deciding {{to take advantage of}} this intelligence, a delay that almost squandered his opportunity. That night, the Army of the Potomac moved toward South Mountain where elements of the Army of Northern Virginia waited in defense of the mountain passes. At the Battle of South Mountain on September 14, the Confederate defenders were driven back by the numerically superior Union forces, and McClellan was in a position to destroy Lee's army before it could concentrate.|$|E

500|$|Even {{though the}} fictional story begins in January 2007, the {{timeline}} {{of the album}} and alternate reality game mentions historical events, such as the September 11 attacks and the Iraq War. From there, fictional events lead to worldwide chaos, including bioterrorism attacks, the United States engaging in nuclear war with Iran, {{and the elimination of}} American civil liberties {{at the hands of the}} fictional government agency The Bureau of Morality. Regardless of being fictional, a columnist of the Hartford Courant commented, [...] "What's scary is that this doesn't seem as far-fetched as it should, given recent revelations about the FBI's abuse of the Patriot Act and the dissent-equals-disloyalty double-speak coming <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> in recent years." ...|$|E

The candidate had the train stopped, and responded that he had been told that if he continued on his political course, [...] "crooks and communists" [...] would smear him. He told the crowd that the Fund had saved the taxpayer money, since it paid for matters that could have been paid for through his Senate expense allowance.

500|$|Most of {{the scandals}} that have marred the {{reputation}} of Harding's administration did not emerge until after his death. The Veterans' Bureau scandal was known to Harding in January 1923 but, according to Trani and Wilson, [...] "the president's handling of it did him little credit". Harding allowed the corrupt director of the bureau, Charles R. Forbes, to flee to Europe, though he later returned and served prison time. Harding had learned that Daugherty's factotum at the Justice Department, Jess Smith, was involved in corruption. The president ordered Daugherty to get Smith <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Washington</b> and removed his name from the upcoming presidential trip to Alaska. Smith committed suicide on May 30, 1923. It is uncertain how much Harding knew about Smith's illicit activities. Murray noted that Harding {{was not involved in}} the corruption and did not condone it.|$|E
