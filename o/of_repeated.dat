40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{need for}} {{patients}} on long-term medication to be periodically reviewed is well documented, but until now {{there have been}} no large-scale systematic studies of the process <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescribing. AIM: To propose a model for the process and control <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescribing in general practice, and to use this model to evaluate the management control and clinical control <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescribing in 50 practices. METHOD: Interviews were conducted with practice staff and the process <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescribing was observed in consenting practices from 57 randomly selected practices in Leeds. A batch <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescriptions was identified in each practice, and the patients' records were examined for evidence of clinical authorization and review. The records of 427 patients taking 556 drugs within three drug groups were studied. A subjective scoring system was used to assess quality of management control. Clinical control was assessed by noting {{the presence or absence of}} evidence in general practitioner records of doctor authorization <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> status, and <b>of</b> clinical review of therapy for each drug. RESULTS: Management control-Many practices had inadequate controls <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescribing, leading to unauthorized repeat prescriptions, poor compliance checks (or none at all), and inadequate systems, if any, for identifying patients in need of medication review, and for bringing them to prescribers' attention. Clinical control- 66 % <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> drugs showed no evidence of authorization by a doctor; 72 % showed no evidence of having been reviewed by a doctor in the previous 15 months. CONCLUSION: Inadequate control <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescribing is wasteful and potentially dangerous. Major improvement is required in the management and clinical aspects of the control <b>of</b> <b>repeat</b> prescribing in many practices. This will need changes in procedures and training, and may require more resources and the imaginative use of nurses and pharmacists...|$|R
500|$|Trinucleotide CAG repeats over 28 are {{unstable}} during replication, {{and this}} instability increases {{with the number}} <b>of</b> <b>repeats</b> present.

40|$|This Master&rsquo;s {{research}} investigated {{approaches for}} engineering <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> prints using digital textile printing technology and universally available computer-aided design software. Current practices for alignment of designs in yardage printed fabrics at garment seams are wasteful {{and do not}} allow for mass customisation. This inefficiency can be overcome with engineered digital printing, a method that allows for an integration of prints with garment patterns to generate Ready-to-Print images. Engineered printing offers more cost-effective use of materials, improved visual appearance, potential for mass customisation and more sustainable manufacturing. Still, technical difficulties exist in the integration of prints with garment patterns. As a result, application for apparel is limited to non-repeating prints and one-off fashion show garments. The integration <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> prints presents even more difficulties. However, the advances in digital printing and computer-aided design technologies call for an examination of possible approaches for achieving improved continuity <b>of</b> a <b>repeating</b> print across a garment. The research used a three-stage mixed method approach. The first qualitative stage examined current practices for design and printing <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> prints. By undertaking Applied Thematic Analysis, the diversity of meanings assigned to words describing attributes <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> prints {{as a result of}} historical and current usage were identified and the terminology consolidated. A taxonomy <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> print attributes was established, with three levels observed: a superordinate level for a surface, a basic for a repeat, and a subordinate for a motif. Quantifiable attributes <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> prints were assigned to each level. The analysis also suggested three potential directions for engineered repeating prints: Modularity Design, Flexible Tiling and Distortion. The second quantitative stage evaluated suggested design directions in four experimental studies: one for each of the directions and a final study combining all three directions to engineer repeating prints for a graded garment. Practical computer-aided design techniques, based on accessible Adobe software tools, were developed for integration <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> prints with garment patterns. The techniques were then tested in comparison with mainstream printing practices. In each experiment, repeating print attributes were examined for their impact on the adaptability <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> prints for engineered printing. All three directions were validated as suitable for engineering <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> prints. Statistical analyses revealed relationships between repeating print attributes and their impact on the adaptability <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> prints for the engineered printing method. The final stage analysed the combined results of the previous two stages. Existing computer- aided design solutions were found to offer opportunities regarding their ability to be integrated into current digital production for innovative and sustainable engineered printing. While the suggested techniques require knowledge of more advanced dynamic editing tools, the research highlights the benefits for both fashion and textile designers to utilise such tools in order to fully embrace the potential digital printing technology has to offer. The research also highlights the need for dedicated software solutions for integration <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> prints with garment patterns. The findings on the impact <b>of</b> <b>repeating</b> print attributes on the adaptability for engineered printing can help in the development of dedicated software...|$|R
