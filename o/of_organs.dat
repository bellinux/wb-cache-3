5|$|Anatomy can {{be studied}} using both {{invasive}} and non-invasive methods {{with the goal of}} obtaining information about the structure and organization <b>of</b> <b>organs</b> and systems. Methods used include dissection, in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and endoscopy, in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. Angiography using X-rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels.|$|E

5|$|Motion, {{the process}} of movement, is {{described}} using specific anatomical terms. Motion includes movement <b>of</b> <b>organs,</b> joints, limbs, and specific sections of the body.

5|$|The ninth century {{revealed}} the first bagpipes, which spread throughout Europe and had many uses from folk instruments to military instruments. The construction of pneumatic organs evolved in Europe starting in fifth-century Spain, spreading to England in about 700. The resulting instruments varied {{in size and}} use from portable organs worn around the neck to large pipe organs. Literary accounts <b>of</b> <b>organs</b> being played in English Benedictine abbeys {{toward the end of}} the tenth century are the first references to organs being connected to churches. Reed players of the Middle Ages were limited to oboes; no evidence of clarinets exists during this period.|$|E

Although transplant rejection remains a problem, recent clinical trials that involved implanting pig insulin-secreting cells into diabetics did reduce these people's need for insulin.|$|E
5|$|The {{first state}} library was the Zusho-ryō ("Bureau of Archives") {{established}} by the Taihō Code from 701. Attached to the Daigaku-ryō, it oversaw the custody (collection and preservation) and transmission of Buddhist and Confucian books from the Nara period, until its destruction by fire in the mid-Heian period (11th century). Collection depended largely on the copying of texts held elsewhere. In addition to the Zusho-ryō, books were also copied at imperial palace libraries, private libraries of aristocrats, temple libraries and at libraries <b>of</b> <b>organs</b> of the state. In the Heian period, the majority of works held in libraries (both those produced in China and those copied in Japan) consisted of Chinese works and scholarly collections were dominated by Chinese secular works. At {{the end of the}} Heian period, the great fire of Kyoto in 1177, and the burning of temples by the Taira in 1180, destroyed {{a large part of the}} literary heritage. During the Kamakura period, the warrior class founded new libraries such as the Kanazawa Bunko.|$|E
5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} is a long, {{wandering}} nerve {{that emerges from}} the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation to a large number <b>of</b> <b>organs</b> in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, {{as well as to}} the atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of depolarization and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor.|$|E

5|$|Music {{in early}} modern Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} musical production in Scotland between the early sixteenth century and the mid-eighteenth century. In this period the court followed the European trend for instrumental accompaniment and playing. Scottish monarchs {{of the sixteenth century}} were patrons of religious and secular music, and some were accomplished musicians. In the sixteenth century the playing of a musical instrument and singing became an expected accomplishment of noble men and women. The departure of James VI to rule in London at the Union of Crowns in 1603, meant that the Chapel Royal, Stirling Castle largely fell into disrepair and the major source of patronage was removed from the country. Important composers of the early sixteenth century included Robert Carver and David Peebles. The Lutheranism of the early Reformation was sympathetic to the incorporation of Catholic musical traditions and vernacular songs into worship, exemplified by The Gude and Godlie Ballatis (1567). However, the Calvinism that came to dominate Scottish Protestantism led to the closure of song schools, disbanding of choirs, removal <b>of</b> <b>organs</b> and the destruction of music books and manuscripts. An emphasis was placed on the Psalms, resulting in the production of a series of Psalters {{and the creation of a}} tradition of unaccompanied singing.|$|E
