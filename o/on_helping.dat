5|$|I went to Iraq {{because what}} I saw when I {{was over there}} was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back <b>on,</b> <b>helping</b> get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these {{young men and women}} who are over there fighting to help this country.|$|E
5|$|Amy has non-playable {{roles in}} a number of other game plots. Her {{attraction}} to Sonic is useful to Cream and Blaze the Cat in Sonic Rush, since they are also looking for him. In Shadow the Hedgehog, Amy appears at Cryptic Castle to ask him to help her find Cream, who has not returned. In the game's final story, unlocked after the player reaches the rest of the endings, Amy admiringly cheers Shadow on. In the 2006 Sonic the Hedgehog game, she mistakes Silver the Hedgehog for Sonic; when he tells her he is looking for someone, she insists <b>on</b> <b>helping</b> him. When Silver attacks Sonic, Amy finds them and blocks Silver's way (saving Sonic's life); he escapes, and Amy yells at Silver. She rescues Elise (who also likes Sonic, although Amy does not know this at the time) from confinement. In Sonic Lost World, Amy and Knuckles care for forest animals while Sonic and Tails rescue the animals' friends. The Deadly Six (the game's antagonists) control one of Eggman's machines to drain life from the world; Amy and Knuckles die, but are brought back to life when Sonic and Tails replenish it.|$|E
5|$|Eragon is a fifteen-year-old boy who {{has lived}} with his uncle Garrow and cousin Roran (Roran Stronghammer) on a farm {{near the village of}} Carvahall, ever since his mother Selena, Garrow's sister, left him there right after his birth. While hunting in the Spine, Eragon is {{surprised}} to see the blue dragon egg, which he believes to be a stone, appear in front of him. A few months later, Eragon witnesses a baby dragon hatch from the egg. Eragon names the dragon Saphira. He raises the dragon in secret until two of King Galbatorix's servants, the Ra'zac, come to Carvahall; though it is later revealed that they weren't looking for the egg at first. Eragon and Saphira manage to escape by hiding in the Spine, but Garrow is fatally wounded and the house and farm are burned down by the Ra'zac. Once Garrow dies, Eragon is left with no reason to stay in Carvahall, so he goes after the Ra'zac with his newly hatched dragon, seeking vengeance for the destruction of his home and his uncle's death. He is accompanied by Brom, an elderly storyteller, who provides Eragon with the sword Zar'roc and insists <b>on</b> <b>helping</b> him and Saphira.|$|E

5|$|Josephine {{grew up in}} a well-to-do and {{politically}} connected progressive family which helped develop in her a strong social conscience and firmly held religious ideals. She married George Butler, an Anglican divine and schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a bannister. The death was a turning point for Josephine, and she focused her feelings <b>on</b> <b>helping</b> others, starting with the inhabitants of a local workhouse. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases—particularly in the British Army and Royal Navy—through the forced medical examination of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Josephine also formed the International Abolitionist Federation, a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent.|$|E
5|$|Little Bee {{explains}} that although Nkiruka was gang raped, murdered, and cannibalised by the soldiers, she {{was allowed to}} escape, and stowed away in the cargo hold of a ship bound for England. Sarah allows Little Bee to stay with her, intent <b>on</b> <b>helping</b> her become a legal British citizen. Lawrence, who is still involved with Sarah, disapproves of her actions and contemplates turning Little Bee in to the police. When he informs Little Bee that he is considering this, she responds that allowing her to stay would be {{what is best for}} Sarah, so if Lawrence turns her in, Little Bee will get revenge by telling his wife Linda about his affair. The two reach an uneasy truce. After spending several days together, Sarah, Lawrence, Little Bee and Charlie take a trip to the park. Charlie goes missing, and Little Bee calls the police while Sarah searches for him. Although he is quickly found, the police become suspicious of Little Bee, and discover that she is in the country illegally.|$|E
5|$|Treatments are varied {{because there}} are {{multiple}} perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus <b>on</b> <b>helping</b> people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example {{of this kind of}} treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based zero tolerance approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.|$|E

40|$|People have {{different}} reactions when they encounter {{different levels of}} health threats. Individual cognitions towards the seriousness of health threat and emotions arise from health threats often motivate people to seek help online and offline. To {{examine the effects of}} cognitions and emotions <b>on</b> <b>help</b> seeking behaviors <b>on</b> different levels of health threats, we propose a research model based on protection motivation theory and cognition-emotion-behavior framework. Empirical data were collected through questionnaires and analyzed by Smart PLS. The results show that perceived susceptibility and perceived severity have positive significant influence on fear which leads on anxiety. Perceived health knowledge has negative influence on anxiety. Fear and anxiety can motivate individuals to seek help online and offline, especially in the high health threats condition. In addition, fear has significant influence <b>on</b> <b>help</b> seeking offline while anxiety has significant influence <b>on</b> <b>help</b> seeking online. Expectation confirmation has different effects <b>on</b> <b>help</b> seeking offline in different levels of health threats. This study extends PMT through the lens of cognition-emotion-behavior framework, and it expands research scope to help seeking behaviors...|$|R
