By replacing the mechanism's rotational joints with equivalent high-stiffness elastic joints, numerical continuation methods can be applied directly to dynamic models of landing gear mechanisms. The effects of using elastic joints are considered through two applications [...] | an <b>overcentre</b> mechanism, and a nose landing gear mechanism. In both cases, selecting a suffcient stiffness for the elastic joint is shown to provide accurate contiuation results. The advantages of this new modelling approach are then demonstrated by considering the unlocking of a nose landing gear with a single uplock/downlock mechanism, when subjected to different orientations and magnitudes of gravitational loading. The unlocking process is shown to be qualitatively insensitive to changes in both load angle and load magnitude, ratifying the robustness of a previously- proposed control methodology for unlocking a nose landing gear with a single uplock/downlock mechanism...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} the simulation model of the forks handling system of a telehandler. The study has been performed through coupled simulation of two software codes, AMESim for the 1 D modelling of hydraulics and Virtual Lab for the mechanical modelling of the telescopic boom and forks. In context the advantage is that coupled simulation involves just one integrator with significant savings in computer time. Aim of the analysis is the development of a validated model capable of predicting system behaviour with adequate accuracy in different operating conditions. Following a kinematic analysis to evidence the characteristics of the mechanical system, such as the automatic forks levelling, forks lever ratio and overrunning load conditions, the detailed hydraulics modelling is discussed with emphasis on <b>overcentre</b> valves. The hydraulic model is interfaced with the mechanical one that based on forces consequent to load induced pressures evaluates in turn velocities and displacements. The complete model received experimental validation through significant boom and forks duty cycles. A fair agreement has been reached confronting experimental and predicted outcome...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The optimal {{values of}} the five {{feedback}} gains of a double-loop controller for the speed control of an <b>overcentred</b> variable-displacement hydraulic motor are experimentally determined by using genetic algorithms. The reciprocal of the criterion of integration of time multiplied by absolute error is proposed as the fitness function that evaluates {{the performance of the}} control. The appropriate specification of the genetic algorithms and the search range of each control gain for the speed control system are presented. It is found that the near-optimal {{values of the}} feedback gains can be obtained within ten generations, which corresponds to about 100 experiments. The optimal gains are also obtained when the inertia or the supply pressure is varied. Optimized feedback gains are confirmed by plotting the fitness function in a given gain space. The fitness distribution indicates that finding the optimal feedback gains by manual tuning is an extremely time-consuming task, and that the genetic algorithm is an efficient scheme economizing time and labour, in optimizing feedback gains for hydraulic servo systems...|$|R
40|$|Current {{landing gear}} {{mechanism}} analysis methods focus on determining purely geometric behaviour of the retraction mechanism, {{to ensure that}} the landing gear will meet its stowed constraints. For detailed analysis work, dynamic simulation is the standard method to determine underlying causes of nonlinear behaviour. The work presented in this thesis provides an alternative analysis approach for analysing quasi-static landing gear mechanisms, to be used to complement and inform the use of dynamic simulations. This alternative method of investigating quasi-static mechanisms is first presented for two planar mechanism example cases: an <b>overcentre</b> mechanism and a nose landing gear mechanism. The method uses static equilibrium equations along with equations describing the geometric constraints in the mechanism. In the spirit of bifurcation analysis, solutions to these steady-state equations are then continued numerically in parameters of interest. Results obtained from the numerical continuation agree with the equivalent results obtained from two <b>overcentre</b> mechanism dynamic models, whilst offering a considerable computation time reduction. The analysis performed with the nose landing gear model demonstrates the flexibility of the continuation approach, allowing conventional model states to be used as continuation parameters without a need to reformulate the equations within the model. The modelling approach is then demonstrated for the case of non-planar landing gear mechanisms, with application to a three-dimensional aircraft main landing gear mechanism model. A design case-study is performed on the landing gear actuator position to demonstrate the potential industrial relevance of the method. The trade-off between maximal efficiency and peak actuator force reduction when positioning the actuator is investigated. The problem formulation allows actuator force, length and efficiency information to be obtained from a single numerical continuation run with minimal data post-processing. Finally, a model of a dual sidestay landing gear mechanism is, presented and used to investigate the mechanism downlock sensitivity to attachment point deflections. Motivation for this study is provided by a desire to understand the underlying nonlinear behaviour that may prevent a dual sidestay landing gear from down- locking under certain conditions. An investigation into the effect of sidestay angle reveals that the geometry prevents the gear from fully retracting at certain sidestay angles. Sidestay flexi- bilities are then introduced to enable the downlock loads to be investigated. It is demonstrated that deflections of even a few milimetres can provide a force barrier to the landing gear down- locking. The underlying nonlinear behaviour is attributed to the formation of double hysteresis loop in the force-locklink angle plane. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
