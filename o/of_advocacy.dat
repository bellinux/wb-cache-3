Zinsou, who had a history <b>of</b> <b>advocacy</b> against the policies of the military, quickly drew the ire of the military leaders by pursuing a host of policies without consultation with them. In addition, to control continued deficits, Zinsou instituted a number of austerity measures and as a result alienated unions and the urban population. The result was that on 10 December 1969, Zinsou was taken into custody by military officers organized by Kouandété and Zinsou was sent to a remote military garrison near Natitingou. Following the coup, Kouandété found {{that he did not have}} the support to rule throughout the entire military, and so instead Paul-Emile de Souza (the director of military affairs for Zinsou's government) was named the provisional head of state as the head of a three person Military directorate (with Kouandété and Colonel Benoît Sinzogan holding the other seats). The military directorate decided to release Zinsou and hold new presidential elections in 1970 without the restrictions of the 1968 elections, thus allowing Apithy, Ahomadégbé, and Maga to run.|$|E

EuroHealthNet carried out a systematic review of the academic and grey literature.

As a result of its work, it produced an online advocacy for health equity toolkit.|$|E

25|$|The {{number of}} {{homeless}} people grew in the 1980s, as housing and social service cuts increased. After many years <b>of</b> <b>advocacy</b> and numerous revisions, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the McKinney–Vento Homeless Assistance Act in 1987—this remains the only piece of federal legislation that allocates funding to the direct service {{of homeless people}}. Over the past decades, the availability and quality of data on homelessness has improved considerably. About 1.56 million people, or about 0.5% of the U.S. population, used an emergency shelter or a transitional housing program between October 1, 2008 and September 30, 2009. Homelessness in the United States increased after the Great Recession in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Having {{moved to}} New Jersey {{with her husband}} and {{children}} in 1969, Woolley became an instructor at Atlantic Community College, but was soon offered the task of creating a B.S. degree program in nursing for The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey which had opened its doors in 1971. The original program she designed was for registered nurses, R.N.'s, without a university degree, to complete a Bachelor of Science in nursing. The transition of nursing education from that of R.N.'s trained in non-university programs, to 4-year B.S.N. programs or their equivalent was a matter <b>of</b> <b>advocacy</b> for Woolley as well as profession, and she subsequently published a number of pieces demonstrating the benefits of university-based nursing programs.|$|E
25|$|On September 5, {{two weeks}} after the riot had been controlled, Anthony Graziosi, an Italian sales {{representative}} with a white beard dressed in dark business attire, was driving in the neighborhood. As he stopped at a traffic light at 11pm, six blocks away from where Yankel Rosenbaum had been murdered, a group of four black men surrounded his car and one of them shot and killed him. It was alleged by Graziosi's family and their attorney, as well as Senator Al D'Amato, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, State Attorney General Robert Abrams, former Mayor Ed Koch, and a number <b>of</b> <b>advocacy</b> organizations, that Graziosi's resemblance to a Hasidic Jew precipitated his murder.

25|$|Furthermore, {{opponents of}} VSU liken fees to council rates or taxes – an {{unpleasant}} but necessary payment for those services which by necessity must be communally provided. VSU proponents respond that student unions are fundamentally not governments {{and should not}} have the right to compel money from people; they also argue that most union services – food, childcare, second-hand bookshops, etc. – already operate in the private sector, sometimes at cheaper prices than the subsidised equivalents. Opponents note that facilities such as playing fields and emergency student loans would have to be taken up by universities since they would almost certainly not be available through the private sector. Opponents of VSU cite that the nature <b>of</b> <b>advocacy</b> and representation fall beyond what could be put to market forces, they further state that the nature of such services prevent them from effectively functioning from within the university, therefore Student Associations must be entrusted to carry out these services.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the ensuing homelessness crisis of the 1980s, concerned citizens across the country demanded {{that the federal government}} provide assistance. After many years <b>of</b> <b>advocacy</b> and numerous revisions, President Reagan signed into law the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act in 1987—this remains the only piece of federal legislation that allocates funding to the direct service of homeless people. The McKinney-Vento Act paved the way for service providers in the coming years. During the 1990s homeless shelters, soup kitchens, and other supportive services sprouted up in cities and towns across the nation. However, despite these efforts and the dramatic economic growth marked by this decade, homeless numbers remained stubbornly high. It became increasingly apparent that simply providing services to alleviate the symptoms of homelessness (i.e. shelter beds, hot meals, psychiatric counseling, etc.), although needed, were not successful at solving the root causes of homelessness. The United States Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH),a federal agency contained in the Executive Branch, was established in 1987 as a requirement of the McKinney-Vento Act of 1987.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} <b>of</b> <b>advocacy,</b> the cold war, and the 1970s energy crisis a massive {{magnetic}} mirror program {{was funded by}} the US federal government in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This program resulted in a series of large magnetic mirror devices including: 2X, Baseball I, Baseball II, the Tandem Mirror Experiment, the Tandem mirror experiment upgrade, the Mirror Fusion Test Facility and the MFTF-B. These machines were built and tested at Livermore from the late 1960s to the mid 1980s. A number of institutions collaborated on these machines, conducting experiments. These included the Institute for Advanced Study and the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The last machine, the Mirror Fusion Test Facility cost 372 million dollars and was, at that time, the most expensive project in Livermore history. It opened on February 21, 1986 and was promptly shut down. The reason given was to balance the United States federal budget. This program was supported from within the Carter and early Reagan administrations by Edwin E. Kintner, a US Navy captain, under Alvin Trivelpiece.|$|E

Because Velazquez [...] "blurred" [...] this distinction, the privileged nature of doctor–patient conversations could be subjected to future regulations and limitations.|$|E
