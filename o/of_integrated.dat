5|$|Many {{insects are}} {{considered}} pests by humans. Insects commonly regarded as pests include {{those that are}} parasitic (e.g. lice, bed bugs), transmit diseases (mosquitoes, flies), damage structures (termites), or destroy agricultural goods (locusts, weevils). Many entomologists are involved in various forms of pest control, as in research for companies to produce insecticides, but increasingly rely on methods of biological pest control, or biocontrol. Biocontrol uses one organism to reduce the population density of another organism — the pest — and is considered a key element <b>of</b> <b>integrated</b> pest management.|$|E
