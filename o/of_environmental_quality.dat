5|$|Many {{overlapping}} entities including city, county, state, {{and federal}} governments share jurisdiction for parts of the watershed. About 60percent of the basin is publicly owned and is managed by the United States Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and the United States Bureau of Reclamation. Under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), assisted by the Oregon Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Quality</b> (DEQ) and other agencies in both states, is charged with controlling water pollution in the basin. United States National Forests and other forests cover about 83percent of the basin; another 6percent is grassland, 3percent shrub, and only 0.2percent wetland. Urban areas account for slightly less than 1percent and farms for about 6percent.|$|E
5|$|Many {{governmental}} entities share {{responsibility for}} the slough and its drainage basin. Decisions by the municipal governments of Portland, Fairview, Gresham, Maywood Park, and Wood Village, {{and the government of}} Multnomah County affect the slough. Metro, the regional governmental agency for the Oregon portion of the Portland metropolitan area, is involved in acquiring and protecting wildlife habitat in places like Big Four Corners Wetlands and Smith and Bybee Wetlands Natural Area, acquiring property to close gaps in the 40 Mile Loop and other trails, and creating additional water access along the slough. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has designated the Oregon Department <b>of</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Quality</b> (DEQ) to regulate the slough under provisions of the federal Clean Water Act. The Port of Portland, a regional agency run by commissioners appointed by the Oregon governor, owns and manages about 11percent of the land in the slough watershed. Three drainage districts that manage water flows in the slough floodplain overlap parts of these other jurisdictions.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{effective}} method of the comprehensive evaluation <b>of</b> ecological <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> in a coal mining area.

40|$|Environmental {{problems}} in the urban area of Belém, Pará, Brazil, deny {{a large portion of}} the population critical <b>environmental</b> <b>quality.</b> The present study evaluated the <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> the urban village of União, in a neighborhood called Terra Firme, Belém, Pará. An integrated urban <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> index was proposed, based on the modeling of indicators <b>of</b> urban <b>environmental</b> <b>quality,</b> urban livability and quality of treated water. These three indices encompass the variables of water supply, garbage collection, vegetation, sewage, road paving, infrastructure condition of households, the existence of urban equipment for common use, public transport, accessibility, family income, employment conditions, education and quality of treated water. The results of the indicators are: urban <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> index, 50. 0 points (indicating a regular level <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> quality); urban livability index, 48. 6 points (representing moderate level of livability); and quality index of the treated water, 98. 1 points (which is an optimal level of water quality). The arithmetic average of the three indices generated an integrated urban <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> <b>of</b> 65. 6 points, a good <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> level <b>of</b> the urban village housing in União. The interpretation of this integrated index reflects the indicators measured in each index. We conclude that the modeling <b>of</b> urban <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> indicators was an important tool for the analysis <b>of</b> urban <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> in micro or macro scales, and this allowed us to propose more efficient management and restructuring of the urban environment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: How much is a wildflower worth? Inspired by “The {{worth of}} a songbird” by Funtowicz and Ravetz (1994) {{we use the}} value of a wildflower as symbol of the {{complexity}} <b>of</b> evaluating <b>environmental</b> <b>qualities</b> and risks. We critically discuss the application of cost-benefit analysis in evaluating <b>environmental</b> impacts <b>of</b> adoption of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We argue that costbenefit analysis should be supplemented with other methods, such as processes for assessing uncertainty, accommodation of scientific disagreements, and integration of stakeholders’ interests and perspectives. A more inclusive perspective is to develop precautionary approaches that recognize the multidimensional nature <b>of</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>qualities</b> and risks, such as irreplaceability, irreversibility, uncertainty and complexity. Precautionary approaches can contribute to develop a stronger environmental responsibility within the framework of rational self-interest.

40|$|Abstract:- Soil <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> is the {{capacity}} of a soil to function, within ecosystem and land use boundaries, to sustain biological productivity, maintain <b>environmental</b> <b>quality,</b> and promote plant, animal and human health'. In the long-term, vegetative rehabilitation of mining wastes aims at, as far as possible, the proper ecological integration of the reclaimed area into the surrounding landscape, which is sustainable and requires minimal maintenance. This article presents here an indicator-based system <b>of</b> soil <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> that evaluates sustainable rehabilitation of mine waste {{through a set of}} 2 subindicators, chemical fertility and stocks of organic matter, and further combines them into a single general Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ). The design and calculation of the indicators were based on sequences of multivariate analyses. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to assess soil quality overall. A GISQ combined the different subindicators providing a global assessment <b>of</b> soil <b>environmental</b> <b>quality.</b> Our findings provide evidence that selected indicators can provide a definitive, quantitative assessment <b>of</b> soil <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> and lend credence to the value of our approach in quantifying relationships between soil function and indicators for specific areas...|$|R
