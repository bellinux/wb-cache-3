5|$|After the {{cancellation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> Scotland v England fixture in 1989, questions were raised {{as to whether}} Scottish football required a separate national stadium.

None of these arguments impressed the National Stadium committee, which consisted of the SFA, Scottish Football League and Queen's Park. The West Terrace was converted to seating in 1991 for only £700,000, but this left two terraces and therefore disqualified Hampden from hosting FIFA World Cup qualification matches.|$|E

5|$|Cloud often forms inland, {{especially}} near hills, {{and reduces}} exposure to sunshine. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600 hours.

Average rainfall is 800–900mm (31–35in). About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August having the lightest.
