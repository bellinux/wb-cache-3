40|$|ABSTRACT Developments in {{computer-mediated}} communications are {{not only}} providing new opportunities for educators but also changing roles and competencies in learning and teaching environments. Experts agree that teaching online requires different roles and competencies. The literature includes several studies on roles and competencies for online teaching. However, as Le Boterf underlines, roles and competencies largely depend on context. This survey study intends to identify roles, competencies and resources for online teaching in Turkey by asking <b>online</b> <b>mentors</b> of Anadolu University {{what they think about}} the roles they should perform and the competencies and resources they should possess in order to teach online successfully. Results have shown that the participant Turkish <b>online</b> <b>mentors</b> agree on the significance of the assessor, the content expert and process facilitator roles; on the other hand, they indicate lower level of necessity for the material producer and the administrator roles. Results have also revealed lack of design competencies among <b>online</b> <b>mentors.</b> Overall, the study has supported Le Boterf’s claim about importance of context on identification of roles and competencies...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{focuses on}} the instructors’ {{experiences}} and lessons learnt in one MOOC, run from the UK, in terms of issues raised about ‘the online support and resources required to foster meaningful learning environments’ (Khan, n. d.) by first-time MOOC designer/educators and <b>online</b> <b>mentors.</b> No other study {{we are aware of}} has yet so fully explored the experiences of these groups of major participants in a MOOC. We tell two stories: that of the MOOC designers (so-called here as they designed the central academic educational resources), and that of <b>online</b> <b>mentors.</b> With each group we explored their reflections on their involvement, and their concerns about the efficacy of the MOOC. Our case study highlights two main aspects in their journeys to make the experience of the learner participants more effective: constructing what the designers saw as effective materials, and what the mentors saw as effective e-support. We begin by introducing the literature on MOOCs to date, with a focus, where possible, on designer and mentor perspectives. We then introduce the case study context, which was a University of Reading, UK, five-week beginners’ academic writing course for international students, before outlining our study. Our findings are presented by group (designer, then mentor), and we finish by summarising their reflections for future MOOC efficacy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{a model of}} learning in a workplace, in which an online course provides flexibility for staff to learn at their convenient hours. A motivation was brought into {{an account of the}} success of learning in a workplace program, based upon Behaviorist learning approach—an <b>online</b> <b>mentor</b> and an accumulated learning activities score was applied; whereas a social constructivist concept was also blended to the online learning environment. Ninety-seven staff was in an online program for 12 weeks, with 3 mentors in a social network online platform [...] NING. Every three weeks, 3 hours of face-to-face meeting was blended to the 9 weeks online programs. The results showed that all staff successfully completed the online learning program. Their opinions on the mentoring system were at a very high level of satisfaction, and few active staff obtained rewards from their collected scores during the online social network activities. Correlation was found between frequency of staff’s participation in social learning activities and achievement with high learning scores {{at the end of the}} program. The model was discussed on its strategies to flexible a learning in a workplace with a blended mode of online and offline, a full support from top level management to allocated staff hour for learning, recognition for the outstanding staff, and value their learned skills. <b>Online</b> <b>mentors</b> and social network took significant roles in triggering learning activities in an online social network environment, which motivated learners themselves as lifelong learners in a digital age...|$|R
