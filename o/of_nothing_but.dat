I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. I crossed the river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, I must say, proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E
5|$|The Augustinian theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil, which raises the concern that if God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into question God's nature or his existence– he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does not exist. Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence. The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world ex nihilo (out <b>of</b> <b>nothing),</b> <b>but</b> maintains that God did not create evil and is not responsible for its occurrence. Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the privation of good– the corruption of God's good creation.|$|E

One of those kings, Vologases IV of Parthia, made his move in late summer or early autumn 161. Vologases entered the Kingdom of Armenia (then a Roman client state), {{expelled}} its king and installed his ownPacorus, an Arsacid like himself. At the time of the invasion, the governor of Syria was Lucius Attidius Cornelianus. Attidius had been retained as governor even though his term ended in 161, presumably to avoid giving the Parthians the chance to wrong-foot his replacement. The governor of Cappadocia, the front-line in all Armenian conflicts, was Marcus Sedatius Severianus, a Gaul with much experience in military matters. But living in the east had a deleterious effect on his character.|$|E

Convinced by the prophet Alexander of Abonutichus that he could defeat the Parthians easily, and win glory for himself, Severianus led a legion (perhaps the IX Hispana) into Armenia, but was trapped by the great Parthian general Chosrhoes at Elegia, a town just beyond the Cappadocian frontiers, high up past the headwaters of the Euphrates. Severianus made some attempt to fight Chosrhoes, but soon realized the futility of his campaign, and committed suicide. His legion was massacred. The campaign had only lasted three days.|$|E

The North American version <b>of</b> ...<b>Nothing</b> <b>but</b> a Dream added all four tracks from the Roll on Summer EP as bonus tracks. Murray Bramwell appraised four Kelly-related works in Adelaide Review, [...] "each of them indicative of the rich variety of his gift". On the album ...Nothing but a Dream, he preferred the opening track, [...] "If I Could Start Today Again", to the radio single, [...] "Somewhere in the City", and found the album generally to be [...] "full of familiar Kelly riffs and trademarks". On Silent Partner Kelly's songwriting with Hale provides [...] "some splendid instrumentals" [...] with [...] "a delightfully airy sound". The Lantana soundtrack showed Kelly's [...] "confidence as a composer and his strong grasp {{of a wide range}} of musical styles". Finally, One Night the Moon included Mairead Hannan's [...] "richly melodic Irish airs" [...] which [...] "beautifully counterpoint Kelly's work" [...] and Carmody's [...] "distinctive ballads".|$|E

500|$|The album's {{title was}} {{inspired}} by one of Shakira's trips to the capital of her native country Colombia. At the El Dorado International Airport in Bogotá, after finishing her Tour Pies Descalzos, part of her luggage was stolen, including a briefcase that contained all the lyrics Shakira {{had been working on}} for the album. Shakira commented, [...] "The worst part about the whole thing was that I couldn't remember them because of the mental block that can be caused by such a traumatic experience as the robbery of such a personal item". Feelings of impotence and emptiness overcame Shakira with such violence that {{for a couple of days}} and nights she thought <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> the people who had taken her material. She could not stop thinking about them: [...] "Who are they? What are they looking for? Where are they?". She searched for a reason behind the theft of her songs. [...] "I came to the conclusion that there are all types of thieves. A thief is not just a person who takes a physical object that doesn't belong to him or her. There are thieves who steal feelings, space, time, dreams, rights", she explained.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{begins with}} an {{announcement}} that viewers have waited for weeks for {{the answer to the}} mystery [...] "Who Is Cartman's Father", but then points out that the answer will not be revealed in this episode; instead, there is a presentation of Not Without My Anus starring Terrance and Phillip. A caption wishes the viewers a happy April Fools' Day. The drama itself opens in a courtroom in Canada, with Terrance on trial for the murder of a local doctor; Phillip is his lawyer while Terrance and Phillip's sworn nemesis, Scott, who has had a long hatred of the duo's toilet humour, is acting as the prosecutor. Scott uses a group of seemingly airtight exhibits to prove Terrance's guilt, while Terrance's defense consists <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> a long string of fart jokes. Ultimately, the jury returns a verdict of not guilty. Angered, Scott promises vengeance. He is ultimately approached by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, proposing a deal: Saddam would assist in getting Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, in exchange for Scott assisting Saddam and his Iraqi associates into Canada. Scott is apprehensive about trusting Saddam, but agrees to the deal. The pair then conspires to kidnap Sally, daughter of Terrance and Celine Dion, and hold her hostage, as bait to lure Terrance and Phillip to Tehran; Saddam's soldiers would then murder Terrance and Phillip on arrival.|$|E
500|$|The track [...] "Receptacle For the Respectable" [...] {{reflects}} the eclecticism {{of the album}} as it [...] "undergoes a complete personality change" [...] {{over the course of}} its four-minute thirty-two-second duration, veering from prog rock to death metal. The song begins as an acoustic guitar-driven pop song and then shifts into a slower bridge section which leads to an even slower coda which has been compared to the music of Burt Bacharach and The Beach Boys' Smiley Smile album and features Paul McCartney chewing carrots and celery to the beat. The track ends with a [...] "pantomime death metal" [...] section with Rhys's [...] "distorted, bellowed vocals" [...] screaming the title phrase. According to Cian Ciaran, the song initially comprised just the first two parts when recorded at Monnow Valley Studios but, by the time the group relocated to Bearsville Studios, Rhys had written and added the third section. While there the band added the fourth section by [...] "pissing about with Pro Tools", looping the bass {{from the end of the}} third section [...] "by accident" [...] to create the musical backing. A fifth, hip hop, section was discussed but the band decided against it, reasoning that [...] "if you're going to do a fifth bit, you'd probably do a sixth, and before you know where you are, you're doing a concept album made up <b>of</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>but</b> bits!". According to the band, the track is the only time on the album where they tried to achieve comedy and [...] "completely went with [...] silly streak".|$|E
