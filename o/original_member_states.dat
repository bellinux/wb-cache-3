30|$|The term “movement” {{became part}} of the {{nomenclature}} due to the connections most of the <b>original</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> of the NAM had with the ideology of liberation, that is, liberation from colonial control. The <b>original</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> seem to have an emotional connection with the term “movement.” If this is the case, the term “movement” should be continued as part of the nomenclature. Some of the Third World organizations have adopted the term “union” taking a cue from the European Union. For example, the Organization of African Unity was recently replaced by African Union. Since different forms of colonialism will continue to be resisted and member states will strive to be independent, borrowing titles from European states should be avoided. Therefore, the term movement will serve the purposes of the revamped organization.|$|E

30|$|If the {{decision}} {{to set up a}} permanent secretariat is made, initially, the concept of “rotation” may be followed in terms of the location of the secretariat and the personnel that would serve in such an institution. Ideally, a simple secretariat should be established in one of the <b>original</b> <b>member</b> <b>states</b> from the Asian or African region. The structure could be expanded depending on the needs and availability of resources. A permanent secretariat would immensely enhance the image and capabilities of the organization. Additional institutions, such as an economic development council and an instrument for internal conflict resolution, could be established later due to the significance of these issues.|$|E

Local banks in ASEAN may have been developing and growing strongly, however global banks such as Standard Chartered Bank and Citibank still have stronger presence in the region. In this regard, Ravi Menon, Managing Director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore said, “As ASEAN becomes an economic powerhouse, so must our ASEAN banks.” (Menon, 2015).|$|E

On the basis of these projects, a typology has been elaborated and four worlds, or groups of countries, have been identified according to their attitudes with respect to EU law and to the conformity of their national procedures with EU regulations. This classification, based on national specificities and their explanations, has a double benefit. Firstly, it enables an understanding, within the different Member States, of the theoretical factors behind the compliance or non-compliance with EU law. It can also help to design or to reinforce procedures aimed at improving the implementation of EU law. regulation; East-Central Europe; East-Central Europe; European law...|$|E

The results demonstrate a concerted effort to establish economies of scale through ownership of distribution companies. A change in strategy occurs as these privatization opportunities disappear. Generation and trading activity become the growth area for these companies as electricity supply becomes another factor that can contribute to the economies of scale. Recent EU-supported efforts towards regionalization of electricity markets, positions these companies well due to their strong regional presence.
