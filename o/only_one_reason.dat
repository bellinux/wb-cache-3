She was {{invited to join the}} Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on June 18, along with 115 other individuals for 2007. Entertainment Weekly put her performance on its end-of-the-decade, [...] "best-of" [...] list, saying, [...] "Sure, Beyoncé's performance was great. And Eddie Murphy's was impressive. But there was really <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> we all rushed to see 2006's Dreamgirls: Jennifer Hudson's soul-to-the-rafters rendition of the classic 'And I'm Telling You I'm Not Going'. When she sang 'You're gonna love me,' it wasn't just a lyric — it was a fact." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 1956 {{flag was}} adopted {{in an era}} when the Georgia General Assembly [...] "was entirely devoted to passing {{legislation}} that would preserve segregation and white supremacy", according to a 2000 research report by the Georgia senate. There are few, if any, written records of what was said on the Georgia House and Senate floors when the 1956 flag bill was being introduced and passed by the Georgia legislature, nor does Georgia law provide for a statement of legislative intent when a bill is introduced, although former U.S. Congressman James Mackay, one of the 32 House members who opposed the change, later stated, “There was <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for putting the flag on there: like the gun rack {{in the back of a}} pickup truck, it telegraphs a message." [...] Additionally, the 2000 report concluded that the [...] "1956 General Assembly changed the state flag" [...] during [...] "an atmosphere of preserving segregation and resentment" [...] to the U.S. government's rulings on integration.|$|E

50|$|IT {{left the}} band and the black metal scene {{altogether}} in 1996, following numerous threats made to him and to his family. According to his sister/manager, that was <b>only</b> <b>one</b> minor <b>reason</b> to his departure from the scene. Evil kept Abruptum going and released material on his own record label, Blooddawn Productions, until 2005 when {{he announced that he}} had ended Abruptum.|$|R
50|$|Endriartono’s {{decision}} to join Nasdem Party has raised questions to many quarters. However, Endriartono stressed that he <b>only</b> had <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> {{that was to}} make a change. “It takes power {{to be able to make}} a change, without power we cannot do anything. That how the (political) system works here. To get the power we must win the election, if not the presidential post, at least we can get a hold of the House of Representatives (DPR) so we can create pro-people policies,” he said.|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps {{you would}} give me some reason for dismissing me," [...] I answered, for I was {{conscious}} of having done my duties {{to the best of}} my power, and knew well that <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> could be given.|$|E
6000|$|Hardy {{shook his}} head impatiently. [...] "You don't seem to suffer from an excess of intellect yourself," [...] he retorted.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{principles}} of inkjet printing, ink composition, receiving layers and print fading. The fading usually does not take place <b>only</b> for <b>one</b> <b>reason,</b> it is affected by more factors at a time. The catalytic fading due to light is studied. The catalytic fading takes place in overprinted areas where are situated more then one ink. The experiment was realized by the exposure of overprinted fields in accelerated ageing test. Mutual influence of two dyes from CMY together and then influence of black dye (K) on these overprinted fields were observed...|$|R

"Grechaninov's Passion Week is a {{companion}} cycle to his better known, All-night Vigil, {{and it is}} wonderful to hear it complete (bits sometime crop up in anthologies here and there, but it's scarcely known outside Russia). The superlatives have already piled up against Charles Bruffy's name, and deservedly so. There can <b>only</b> be <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for a label to release repertoire they already had in their catalogue, {{and that is that}} the new performance is so striking."William Whitehead, BBC Music Magazine - May 2007 Choral/Vocal CD of the Month ...|$|R
60|$|Now, {{there could}} <b>only</b> be <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> on earth for Neigh's presence--her remark {{that she might}} attend--for Neigh took no more {{interest}} in antiquities than {{in the back of}} the moon. Ethelberta was a little flurried; perhaps he had come to scold her, or to treat her badly in that indefinable way of his by which he could make a woman feel as nothing without any direct act at all. She was afraid of him, and, determining to shun him, was thankful that Lord Mountclere was near, to take off the edge of Neigh's manner towards her if he approached.|$|R

"Besides, {{you will}} find your nightgown in my hiding-place, with the smear of the paint on it; and {{you will want to}} know how it came to be hidden by me? and why I said nothing to you about it in my life-time?

[...] His expression suddenly changed his face darkened and hardened very strangely. [...] "Stop!" [...] he cried, before I could answer him.

30|$|Often {{this could}} also mean to {{communicate}} undesirable futures to foster action against them. These types of predictions serve to become self-inhibiting prophecies.

Not one {{thoroughbred}} in ten makes good, unless he's got {{the heart}} of a coward, and that's just what distinguishes them from mongrels and cross-breds. Like race-horses, they're hot-blooded. They've got sensitiveness, and pride. Pride's the worst. You listen to me. I was born into the business and I've studied it all my life. I'm a success.

That is it, captain. I'd lay you a beaver-skin to a {{rabbit-pelt}} that I'm on the track. There's been a party of a dozen horsemen along this ground since the dew began to fall. If they were delayed, they would have time to form their plans before we came." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{the last}} and most {{significant}} need for the surplus labor army remains to be stated. This surplus labor acts as a check upon all employed labor. It is the lash by which the masters hold the workers to their tasks, or drive {{them back to their}} tasks when they have revolted. It is the goad which forces the workers into the compulsory [...] "free contracts" [...] against which they now and again rebel. There is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> under the sun that strikes fail, and that is because there are always plenty of men to take the strikers' places.|$|E

6000|$|Again Carrie silenced him. [...] "Wait," [...] she said. [...] "Did {{you suppose}} that if I hated {{my husband and}} loved you still, I could have requited all {{that he has done}} for me with treachery? Do you think I have no sense of honour or any sense of shame? It was <b>only</b> for <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> I let you go as far as you have done. I wanted {{to see if there was}} a spark of courage or {{generosity}} in you, because I should have liked to think as well as I could of you. There was none. After the summer you--would have gone away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quite so. Why? When we {{answer that}} we have made some {{progress}} with our little problem. Why? There can be <b>only</b> <b>one</b> adequate <b>reason.</b> Some <b>one</b> wanted to learn to imitate your writing, and had to procure a specimen of it first. And now if we pass on to the second point we find that each throws light upon the other. That point is the request made by Pinner that you should not resign your place, but should leave the manager of this important business in the full expectation that a Mr. Hall Pycroft, whom he had never seen, was about to enter the office upon the Monday morning." ...|$|R

Remember, I sailed from England {{with him in}} the Wanderer; and I was only {{transferred}} to the Sea-mew long after we were locked up in the ice. I was Richard Wardour's companion on board ship for months, and I learned there to do him justice. Under all his outward defects, I tell you, there beats a great and generous heart. Suspend your opinion, my lad, until you know my friend as well as I do. No more of this now. Give me the dice and the box." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because this is serious," [...] {{answered}} Brown; [...] "this is not spilt snuff or loose pebbles, {{that might}} {{be there for a}} hundred reasons. There is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> I know of for this being done; and the reason goes down to the roots of the world. These religious pictures are not just dirtied or torn or scrawled over, which might be done in idleness or bigotry, by children or by Protestants. These have been treated very carefully--and very queerly. In every place where the great ornamented name of God comes in the old illuminations it has been elaborately taken out. The only other thing that has been removed is the halo round the head of the Child Jesus. Therefore, I say, let us get our warrant and our spade and our hatchet, and go up and break open that coffin." ...|$|E
60|$|Imagine a {{world of}} {{reasonable}} beings! The Ten Commandments would be unnecessary: no reasoning being sins, no reasoning creature makes mistakes. There would be no rich men, for what reasonable man cares for luxury and ostentation? There would be no poor: that I should eat enough for two while my brother in the next street, as good a man as I, starves, is not reasonable. There would be no difference of opinion on any two points: there is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason.</b> You, dear Reader, would find, that on all subjects you were of the same opinion as I. No novels would be written, no plays performed; the lives of reasonable creatures do not afford drama. No mad loves, no mad laughter, no scalding tears, no fierce unreasoning, brief-lived joys, no sorrows, no wild dreams--only reason, reason everywhere.|$|E
50|$|Being {{that it was}} a pseudo-court show in an era {{in which}} most court {{programming}} used an arbitration-based reality format, Eye for an Eye was a nontraditional series within the judicial genre.

40|$|C. plebejana were reared from egg {{to adult}} {{at a range}} of {{constant}} temperatures. At 10 -degrees-C no immature stages survived. Development rates increased over the temperature range 14 - 34 -degrees-C; these were simulated with a non-linear model. Females emerged before males. Fecundity decreased with increased rearing temperature {{as a direct result}} of reduced adult female weight. At 34 -degrees-C development rate and survival were reduced and all eggs laid were infertile. Optimum temperature for population increase was 28 -degrees-C. Validation of a non-linear model for development rate shows that the species of host-plant affects mean development rates of tipworm.

Now, there is only one book which tells how that can be done, and there is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> for doing it; namely, to find out what is some other person's secret. I shall not ask you whose secret you wanted to find out, but I must request you never to do such a thing again without consulting me.

60|$|There was <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> {{which made}} Ward Mortimer's {{position}} {{a little difficult}} at the Belmore Street Museum, {{and that was the}} extreme eminence of the man whom he had to succeed. Professor Andreas was a profound scholar and a man of European reputation. His lectures were frequented by students from every part of the world, and his admirable management of the collection intrusted to his care was a commonplace in all learned societies. There was, therefore, considerable surprise when, at the age of fifty-five, he suddenly resigned his position and retired from those duties which had been both his livelihood and his pleasure. He and his daughter left the comfortable suite of rooms which had formed his official residence in connection with the museum, and my friend, Mortimer, who was a bachelor, took up his quarters there.|$|E
60|$|There is <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>reason</b> why all grown-up {{people do}} not play with toys; {{and it is a}} fair reason. The reason is that playing with toys takes so very much more time and trouble than {{anything}} else. Playing as children mean playing is the most serious thing in the world; and as soon as we have small duties or small sorrows we have to abandon to some extent so enormous and ambitious a plan of life. We have enough strength for politics and commerce and art and philosophy; we have not enough strength for play. This is a truth which every one will recognize who, as a child, has ever played with anything at all; any one who has played with bricks, any one who has played with dolls, any one who has played with tin soldiers. My journalistic work, which earns money, is not pursued with such awful persistency as that work which earned nothing.|$|E
50|$|Many black cabs have {{a turning}} circle of <b>only</b> 25 ft. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> {{for this is}} the {{configuration}} of the famed Savoy Hotel: The hotel entrance's small roundabout meant that vehicles needed the small turning circle in order to navigate it. That requirement became the legally required turning circles for all London cabs, while the custom of a passenger's sitting on the right, behind the driver, provided a reason for the right-hand traffic in Savoy Court, allowing hotel patrons to board and alight from the driver's side.|$|R
5000|$|The federal {{republic}} of Germany and the German Democratic Republic followed different paths {{when it came}} to demographics. The politics of the German Democratic Republic was pronatalistic while that of the Federal Republic was compensatory.Fertility in the GDR was higher than that in the FRG. Demographic politics was <b>only</b> <b>one</b> of the <b>reasons.</b> Women in the GDR had fewer [...] "biographic options", young motherhood was expected of them.

50|$|Currently, {{the lake}} is closed to fishing. The fishery struggles to produce large gamefish. For instance, in a survey {{conducted}} by the MnDNR in 2005, the normal range of Northern Pike was <b>only</b> 2-6 lb. <b>One</b> <b>reason</b> that can be attributed to this {{is the fact that the}} lake has experienced several fish kills in the last several decades. The application of rotenone on the lake has largely depleted the populations of larger/older fish. Although {{the lake is}} closed to fishing and has experienced several fish kills, several species can still be found there.|$|R
