Acute toxicity in fish, as indicated by 96h LC50 tests, is in the range of 1,000-3,000 ug L−1 for carbon chain lengths less than C14. LC50 values for chain lengths greater than C14 range from 600 to 1400 ug L−1. Chronic toxicity data for fish is 420 ug/L.

A World Bank study carried out in Sana’a, Yemen, in 1983 makes a detailed economic comparison of waste stabilization ponds, aerated lagoons, <b>oxidation</b> <b>ditches</b> and trickling filters. According to this study, stabilization pond technology is a cheaper option up to a land cost of US$ 7.8 per square meter. Above this cost, <b>oxidation</b> <b>ditches</b> become the cheapest option. However, often the main constraint against selecting this technology is not land cost but land availability.

40|$|Advanced {{wastewater}} treatment plants must meet permit requirements for organics, solids, nutrients and indicator bacteria, while striving {{to do so in}} a cost effective manner. This requires meeting day-to-day fluctuations in climate, influent flows and pollutant loads as well as equipment availability with appropriate and effective process control measures. A study was carried out to assess performance and process control strategies at the Falkenburg Road Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant in Hillsborough County, Florida. Three main areas for control of the {{wastewater treatment}} process are aeration, return and waste sludge flows, and addition of chemicals. The Falkenburg AWWTP uses <b>oxidation</b> <b>ditches</b> where both nitrification and denitrification take place simultaneously in a low dissolved oxygen, extended aeration environment. Anaerobic selectors before the <b>oxidation</b> <b>ditches</b> help control the growth of filamentous organisms and may also initiate biological phosphorus removal. The addition of aluminum sulfate for chemical phosphorus removal ensures phosphorus permit limits are met. Wasting is conducted by maintaining a desired mixed liquor suspended solids (MLSS) concentration in the <b>oxidation</b> <b>ditches.</b> For this study, activated sludge modeling was used to construct and calibrate a model of the plant. This required historical data to be collected and compiled, and supplemental sampling to be carried out. Kinetic parameters were adjusted in the model to achieve simultaneous nitrification-denitrification. A sensitivity analysis found maximum specific growth rates of nitrifying organisms and several half saturation constants to be influential to the model. Simulations were run with the calibrated model to observe relationships between sludge age, MLSS concentrations, influent loading, and effluent nitrogen concentrations. Although the case-study treatment plant is meeting discharge permit limits, there are several recommendations for improving operation performance and efficiency. Controlling wasting based on a target MLSS concentration causes wide swings in the sludge age of the system. Mixed liquor suspended solids concentration is a response variable to changes in sludge age and influent substrate. Chemical addition for phosphorus removal should also be optimized for cost savings. Finally, automation of aeration control using online analyzers will tighten control and reduce energy usage...|$|R

The full-scale experiment results of 574 days showed that nitrogen removal efficiency depended on the degree of nitrification and denitrification in the outer channel, which was the largest contributor for TN removal in the Orbal <b>oxidation</b> <b>ditch.</b> Appropriate aeration control in the outer channel was essential to balance nitrification and denitrification in the Orbal <b>oxidation</b> <b>ditch.</b> When DO was as low as about 0. 2 mg/L in the outer channel, the highest TN removal efficiency of 75 % was obtained.

Two 24 m 2 (width 2 m, length 12 m) parallel plastic <b>oxidation</b> <b>ditches</b> material were installed on a lake near the inlet of the municipal sewage. Zizania caduciflora and Canna generalis were grown in the ditches with plastic floating supporters for the removal of N and P from the sewage. The experiment was conducted firstly with municipal sewage in autumn-winter seasons for about 150 days under the following conditions: 2 m 3 /h influent flow, 0. 75 kW jet-flow aerator (air/water of 5), 18 h HRT (hydrological retention time) and a return ratio of 10. Then it was run with the polluted lake water in summer-autumn for about 160 days with an aerator of 1. 25 kW and an influent of 6 m 3 /h (air/water 3. 3, HRT 6 h). The performance was quite stable during the experimental period for the municipal sewage treatment. The average removal rates of COD (chemical oxygen demand), SS (suspended solids), TP (total phosphorus), NH 4 +-N and inorganic-N were 70. 6, 75. 8, 72. 6, 52. 1 and 50. 3 %, respectively.

The several forces acting on the forming bubble have been modelled in order to understand the dynamics of the bubble growth and detachment. The bubble detachment is controlled by the drag force due to the liquid motion and not by the buoyancy force. The experimental analysis of the bubble growth has shown that, under liquid cross-flow conditions, the bubbles move downstream and are flattened during their growth (position of the bubble centre of gravity, bubble inclination angle). The bubbles spread over the orifice surface, and the advancing and the receding bubble angles were measured.

Three WWTPs received high-strength wastewater (WW) (BOD> 400 mg/L), four normal-strength WW (BOD = 150 to 260 mg/L) and five received weak-strength WW (BOD < 150 mg/L).

Short chain fatty acids and glycerol are only utilized together with long chain fatty acids; other organic substrates are not consumed. The organism requires ammonium salts and reduced-sulphur compounds for growth. Thiamin and cyanocobalamin were found to be essential vitamins. Optimum temperature is 25 °C and the pH of the medium has to be above 7. During the early growth phase in batch culture with an oleic acid ester (Tween 80) as the limiting substrate, M. parvicella stores large amount of lipids, mainly oleic acid in esterified form in its cells. In a subsequent period the stored lipids are used for energy supply and synthesis of cell protein. Growth kinetics were studied by cultivating the organism in a chemostat. The maximum specific growth rate was found to be 0. 06 h - 1 ; the K S value for Tween 80 was too low to be determined. The maximum yield coefficient and the maintenance on Tween 80 were 0. 34 g cell dry weight/ g Tween 80 consumed and 6. 3 mg Tween 80 /g cell dry weight. h, respectively. As only the oleic acid moiety of Tween 80 is consumed, these values must be corrected for the non-fatty acid moiety (76 %) of the Tween 80 molecule. Although oleic acid is an excellent substrate for M. parvicella, the organism was found to be inhibited at higher concentrations of this compound. Decreasing pH and decreasing biomass concentration promote the inhibiting action of oleic acid in washed cell suspensions. Various surface-active compounds which are not utilized as carbon source enhance the oxygen uptake rate of washed cells. The increase of the oxygen uptake due to added Tween 80 or oleic acid is probably caused by substrate respiration as well as a non-substrate-specific stimulation caused by surfaceactive properties of these compounds. The affinity for oxygen of M. parvicella is high (K S value &lt; 0. 016 mg/l). Abundant growth of M. parvicella was obtained in activated sludge in a bench- scale plant fed with waste water containing oleic acid and supplied with a limited amount of oxygen. These results explain the excessive growth of M. parvicella in activated sludge supplied with raw domestic sewage. This type of sewage contains a considerable amount of fatty matter and the activated-sludge process is usually operated at a low oxygen concentration in the mixed liquor. ...|$|R
