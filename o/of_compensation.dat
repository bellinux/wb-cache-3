40|$|In many {{eukaryotic}} organisms, {{gender is}} determined {{by a pair of}} heteromorphic sex chromosomes. Degeneration of the non-recombining Y chromosome is a general facet of sex chromosome evolution. Selective pressure to restore expression levels of X-linked genes relative to autosomes accompanies Y-chromosome degeneration, thus driving the evolution <b>of</b> dosage <b>compensation</b> mechanisms. This review focuses on evolutionary aspects <b>of</b> dosage <b>compensation,</b> in light <b>of</b> recent advances in comparative and functional genomics that have substantially increased our understanding of the molecular mechanisms <b>of</b> dosage <b>compensation</b> and how it evolved. We review processes involved in sex chromosome evolution, and discuss the dynamic interaction between Y degeneration and the acquisition <b>of</b> dosage <b>compensation.</b> We compare mechanisms <b>of</b> dosage <b>compensation</b> and the origin <b>of</b> dosage <b>compensation</b> genes between different taxa and comment on sex chromosomes that apparently lack compensation mechanisms. Finally, we discuss how dosage compensation systems can also influence the evolution of well-established sex chromosomes...|$|R

Whether compensation policies can neglect this aspect depends crucially on the credibility <b>of</b> sticky <b>compensation</b> prices. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{length of}} time that a typical {{prisoner}} was kept at the Bastille continued to decline, and by Louis XVI's reign {{the average length of}} detention was only two months.

Prisoners leaving the Bastille could be granted pensions on their release by the Crown, either as a form <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> or as a way of ensuring future good behaviour – Voltaire was granted 1,200 livres a year, for example, while Latude received an annual pension of 400 livres.|$|E

5|$|Germanwings' {{parent company}} Lufthansa offered victims' {{families}} an initial aid payment {{of up to}} €50,000, separate from any legally-required compensation for the disaster. Elmar Giemulla, a professor of aviation law at the Technical University of Berlin quoted by the Rheinische Post, said he expected the airline would pay €10–30million in compensation. The Montreal Convention sets a per-victim cap of €143,000 in the event an airline is held liable, unless negligence can be proved. Insurance specialists said although co-pilot Andreas Lubitz hid a serious illness from his employer and deliberately crashed the passenger aircraft, these facts would not affect the issue <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> nor be applicable to the exclusion clause in Lufthansa's insurance policy.

To finance their debt, the Akersbanerne-owned Smestad Line was transferred to Holmenkolbanen on 16 November 1933, with Akersbanerene taking over the majority of shares in Holmenkolbanen. The latter remained listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. From 4 January 1937, Bærumsbanen took over the operation of trams on the Østensjø Line, though the ownership of the line remained with Akersbanerne. Oslo Sporveier started operating trolleybus lines from 1939. On 1 October 1944, Oslo Sporveier bought Bærumsbanen and took over {{the operation of the}} Lillaker and Østensjø Lines. On 1 January 1948, the municipalities of Oslo and Aker merged, and on 31 May 1949, the two municipally-owned companies, Oslo Sporveier and Akersbanerne, merged, taking the name of Oslo Sporveier. The following year, Oslo Sporveier took over Ekebergbanen.

5|$|Johnson {{believed}} that Congressional business was too slow and tedious, {{and that the}} per diem system <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> encouraged delays {{on the part of}} members. To remedy this, he sponsored the Compensation Act of 1816. The measure proposed paying annual salaries of $1,500 to congressmen rather than a $6 per diem for the days the body was in session. (At the time, this had the effect of increasing the total compensation from about $900 to $1500. Johnson noted that congressmen had not had a pay increase in 27 years, and that $1500 was less than the salaries of the 28 clerks employed by the government.) Johnson's bill provided that if a congressman was absent, his salary would be reduced proportionally.|$|E
