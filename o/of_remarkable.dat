5|$|Prolific and versatile, Ruisdael {{depicted}} {{a wide variety}} of landscape subjects. From 1646 he painted Dutch countryside scenes <b>of</b> <b>remarkable</b> quality for a young man. After a trip to Germany in 1650, his landscapes took on a more heroic character. In his late work, conducted when he lived and worked in Amsterdam, he added city panoramas and seascapes to his regular repertoire. In these, the sky often took up two-thirds of the canvas. In total he produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls.|$|E
5|$|The {{legacy of}} PedroII of Brazil began to become {{apparent}} {{soon after his}} death. Emperor PedroII was the second and last monarch of the Empire of Brazil, whose long 58-year reign (1831–1889) represented a time <b>of</b> <b>remarkable</b> prosperity and progress for his country. Despite his achievements, he was deposed in a coup by disgruntled republicans, {{though there was no}} desire for a change in the form of government among the majority of the Brazilian people.|$|E
5|$|The 1890s were {{a period}} <b>of</b> <b>remarkable</b> {{creative}} output for Durkheim. In 1893, he published The Division of Labour in Society, his doctoral dissertation and fundamental {{statement of the}} nature of human society and its development. Durkheim's interest in social phenomena was spurred on by politics. France's defeat in the Franco-Prussian War led to the fall of the regime of Napoleon III, which was then replaced by the Third Republic. This in turn resulted in a backlash against the new secular and republican rule, as many people considered a vigorously nationalistic approach necessary to rejuvenate France's fading power. Durkheim, a Jew and a staunch supporter of the Third Republic with a sympathy towards socialism, was thus in the political minority, a situation that galvanized him politically. The Dreyfus affair of 1894 only strengthened his activist stance.|$|E

5|$|The 2005–06 season {{proved to}} be one <b>of</b> <b>remarkable</b> {{personal}} achievements for Henry. On 17 October 2005, Henry became the club's top goalscorer of all time; two goals against Sparta Prague in the Champions League meant he broke Ian Wright's record of 185 goals. On 1 February 2006, he scored a goal against West Ham United, bringing his league goal tally up to 151, breaking Arsenal legend Cliff Bastin's league goals record. Henry scored his 100th league goal at Highbury, a feat unparalleled {{in the history of}} the club, and a unique achievement in the Premier League. On the final day of the Premier League season, Henry scored a hat-trick against Wigan Athletic in the last ever match played at Highbury. He completed the season as the league's top goalscorer, was voted the FWA Footballer of the Year for the third time in his career, and was selected in the FIFA World XI.|$|E
5|$|Homer and {{his wife}} Marge have three children: Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. As the family's provider, he works at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant as safety inspector. Homer embodies several American working class stereotypes: he is a crude, bald, obese, short-tempered, neglectful of the rules, clumsy, lazy, heavy drinking, ignorant and idiotic person; however, he is {{essentially}} a decent man and fiercely devoted to his family, often ignoring his own personal interests for those of his family. Examples include working long hours in order to buy Lisa a horse, dealing with Marge's sisters when they come over, moving back to Springfield instead of staying in a job he loves, getting Bart a ride back to Springfield after getting stranded during spring break, going to Lisa's band concerts, and giving up his love of pork chop night {{in order to take}} his family out on town to try something they like. Despite the suburban blue-collar routine of his life, he has had a number <b>of</b> <b>remarkable</b> experiences, including going to space, climbing the tallest mountain in Springfield by himself, making a movie with Mel Gibson, fighting President George H. W. Bush, fighting in professional boxing and earning a shot at the heavyweight title, and winning a Grammy Award.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-seven of the carvings depict animals: rabbits, dogs, a puppy biting a cat, a ewe {{feeding a}} lamb, monkeys, lions, bats, and the Early Christian motif of two doves {{drinking}} from a ewer. Eighteen of the misericords have mythological subjects, including mermaids, dragons and wyverns. Five of the carvings are clearly narrative, {{such as the}} Fox and the Geese, {{and the story of}} Alexander the Great being raised to Heaven by griffins. There are three heads: a bishop in a mitre, an angel and a woman wearing a veil over her hair arranged in coils over each ear. Eleven carvings are of human figures, among which are several <b>of</b> <b>remarkable</b> design, having been conceived by the artist specifically for their purpose of supporting a shelf. One figure lies beneath the seat, supporting the shelf with his cheek, one hand and one foot. Another sits in a contorted manner supporting the weight on his elbow, while another figure squats with his knees wide apart and a strained look on his face.|$|E

As a man of culture, Thierno Abdourahmane was a progressive. He was in his private life, as in his Islamic belief. He was progressive in his Fula literary creations.|$|E
25|$|The rather thin coastal strip {{is a very}} fertile plain mainly free <b>of</b> <b>remarkable</b> {{mountains}} {{except those}} around the Cap de la Nau area in northern Alicante province and the Peñíscola (Peníscola) area in the Castellón province. Typical of this coastal area are wetlands and marshlands such as L'Albufera close to Valencia, El Fondo in Elche (Elx) and Crevillent, La Marjal near Pego or El Prat in Cabanes, also the former wetlands and salt evaporation ponds in the Santa Pola and Torrevieja area. All of them are key RAMSAR sites which make Valencia of high relevance for both migratory and resident seabirds and waterbirds.|$|E
25|$|Kiki {{has also}} been {{compared}} to other characters in Miyazaki's films. While there are overt differences in demeanor between Kiki and San from Princess Mononoke, a character who is motivated by anger, both characters take {{control over their own}} lives. This theme <b>of</b> <b>remarkable</b> independence is also seen in Miyazaki's earlier works, such as in Nausicaä in Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind. Kiki is also compared to Chihiro of Spirited Away {{in the sense that they}} are both young girls attempting to seek independence without being rebellious. Chihiro is able to develop her independence through her friends and parents, just as Kiki leaves her village with her parents' blessings.|$|E
