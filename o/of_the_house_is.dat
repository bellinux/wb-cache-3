5|$|Ashlawn, {{named for}} the ash trees that once sat in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>is</b> {{also known as the}} Joshua Perkins House, after its first owner.|$|E
5|$|The centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> {{occupied}} by the hallway and staircase, which show {{the greatest number of}} changes since the original design.|$|E
5|$|Abilities of the Council include {{confirming}} gubernatorial {{appointments and}} certifying elections. The Massachusetts House of Representatives and Massachusetts Senate comprise the legislature of Massachusetts, {{known as the}} Massachusetts General Court. The House consists of 160 members while the Senate has 40 members. Leaders of the House and Senate are chosen {{by the members of}} those bodies; the leader <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>is</b> known as the Speaker while the leader of the Senate is known as the President. Each branch consists of several committees. Members of both bodies are elected to two-year terms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{city was}} {{measured}} by Brahmins; <b>the</b> foundations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> laid and at least some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> built by <b>the</b> Yadavas (2.58.9 - 15).|$|R
50|$|Parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> may <b>be</b> {{older than}} 1760, but <b>the</b> current shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> {{determined}} by later renovations. <b>The</b> west bay <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> added around 1800. The building was moved about 80 feet and put onto a new foundation in the 1920s.|$|R
5000|$|Cucuteni-Trypillia <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> roofed {{with live}} turf or {{thatched}} reeds. <b>The</b> shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> usually rectangular but some {{were laid out}} in an [...] "L" [...] shape. Some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> divided into separate rooms while others contained a semi-open functional space, or atrium. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cucuteni-Trypillia <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> two-stories high.|$|R
5|$|Although many {{stones and}} {{materials}} were salvaged {{and used to}} rebuild the Hawkins priory in Virginia, the reconstructed house incorporated other designs and influences. Following the acquisition of the Warwickshire property, the Weddells hired chief architect Henry Grant Morse and scouted the English countryside, surveying properties and considering various designs they could incorporate into the rebuilding process. As a result, the reconstruction is not {{a replica of the}} original building. The west wing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> actually a replica of Sulgrave Manor, a small manor house in Northamptonshire, England, which once belonged to Lawrence Washington, an ancestor of America's first president, George Washington. However, the center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> a reproduction of the original Warwickshire priory and uses the curvilinear gables, strapwork design, and balustrades that the English commonly adapted from the Low Countries in the early seventeenth century. The east wing of the house, however, is based on Wormleighton Manor, a Spencer-Churchill family estate in England.|$|E
5|$|In Boston, after Vivien (Connie Britton) catches Ben (Dylan McDermott) {{cheating}} on her, he begs for her forgiveness, {{and says he}} {{would do anything to}} save their marriage. This includes getting out of Boston and relocating to a different city. He shows her pictures of a great house in an older district of Los Angeles, claiming Vivien loves old houses. He tells her the price <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> strangely lower than those around it, {{and that it would be}} a great place for the family to start over.|$|E
5|$|In Pittsburgh, two FBI agents, Angus Stedman (Lawrence LeJohn) and James Leeds (Kevin McClatchy), are {{observing a}} house when Leeds falls asleep. When he awakes, he discovers that {{the front door}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> open. The two agents {{investigate}} and stumble upon a room filled with dead bodies. Suddenly, a man wielding an axe and possessing a third eye murders both agents with {{a blow to the}} head.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>housing</b> <b>is</b> {{owned by}} Anglo Coal. The company {{operates}} and maintains some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> town's infrastructure. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>are</b> almost identical, {{in this instance}} there are three types of houses; lowset L-shaped, lowset square and highset.|$|R
50|$|Ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> {{considered}} {{distinct from}} ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materials {{used to make}} <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> Owners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> materials <b>were</b> permitted to vindicate the materials upon demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> but <b>the</b> demolition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> forbidden by <b>the</b> Twelve Tables.|$|R
50|$|In 1924 <b>the</b> {{remaining}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{estate and}} <b>house</b> <b>was</b> {{sold to a}} group of local businessmen, who formed Alton Towers Limited. Although <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>were</b> sold off, <b>the</b> grounds were restored and remained open to <b>the</b> public. Parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>were</b> converted into cafés and toilets for public use.|$|R
5|$|The Acors Barns House {{is located}} in New London, Connecticut. Built in 1837, the Acors Barns House is a two-and-one half story Greek Revival house with a gable roof and clapboarded exterior. The front facade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> five bays wide with a Greek Revival portico leading to the main entrance. Additions to the house include a {{projecting}} center dormer, and second-story projection over a partially enclosed veranda. The plain exterior is contrasted by interior's elaborate hall ceilings, detailed woodwork and arched marble fireplaces.|$|E
5|$|The {{house is}} built on a flat terrace near the south west of corner of the estate. The two storey {{building}} is constructed of brick in a classical style, dressed with ham stone features and a hipped tile roof.

The entrance facade is asymmetrical, with a tall arcaded entrance projecting out from {{the house on the}} south-west corner.|$|E
5|$|The {{panorama}} on the Library punchbowl {{begins with}} a view of the eastern shore of Sydney Cove. In the foreground is an octagonal two-storey, yellow, sandstone house ①, built by Governor Macquarie in 1812 for his favourite boatman and former water bailiff, Billy or William Blue. The drawing of this little house – now the site of the Sydney Opera House — is out of all proportion to its actual modest size. To the left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> a sandy beach where the Circular Quay ferry wharves now stand. Facing the beach is First Government House ② where the Museum of Sydney is now situated.|$|E

In 1974 <b>the</b> neighborhood <b>housed</b> about 2,000 people and about 5% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> vacant. [...] In 2010, the neighborhood's population {{had declined to}} about 800 people and about 25% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> vacant.|$|R

5|$|The two-storey L-shaped {{main house}} forms {{the east and}} south sides of a {{courtyard}} with single-storey stables forming {{the north and west}} sides. To the south-west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>is</b> a second, larger courtyard flanked on its west side by a large barn and on its north and south by single storey return wings.|$|E
5|$|The west facade <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} ornate, and faces the Hudson River, {{with a view}} of the river from its terrace and west-facing windows. The curtain wall between the facade's pavilions {{contains}} a semicircular portico, and its entablature is upheld by Ionic columns, and supports a balustrade. A flight of semicircular steps descends to the terrace. The river front is parallel with the east front, which had a porte-cochère, a minor entrance, and a service entrance. The main entrance is at the building's south, directly approached by the south drive. The entrance is recessed, with a portico of Ionic columns over the entranceway.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{foundations}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>are</b> made <b>of</b> cut stone, {{while the}} rear wing's foundation {{is made of}} rubble stone interfiled with cement. <b>The</b> outer walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>are</b> made <b>of</b> red brick. <b>The</b> porches are made of wood and painted white.|$|R
50|$|If {{you happen}} to observe carefully, not only <b>the</b> outer {{surfaces}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>are</b> washed in white, but <b>the</b> inner walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>are</b> white as well. There {{seems to be a}} minor to no degradation on <b>the</b> materials <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> - a proof that this <b>house</b> <b>is</b> excellently maintained.|$|R
50|$|The large Federal {{front part}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> added in 1809. Both the 1790 and 1809 {{sections}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>are</b> <b>of</b> brick. Galusha moved to Jericho in 1824 and <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> occupied {{by him and}} his descendants (including the Howe family, two of whom married Truman's daughters.) into the 1930s.|$|R
5|$|To the {{north-east}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> the estate's former stable building. This {{was built}} {{around the time of}} the fifth Earl's extension of the house and is aligned on a north-south axis. The building comprises three three-storey gable-fronted pavilions separated by a pair of two-storey wings. The façades are of brick, with the west façade painted white and the east unpainted. The roof is of slate with a clock tower in the centre of the east side of the central pavilion. Close to the stables is an underground brick-built ice house accessed by a vaulted tunnel. The ice house dates from 1788.|$|E
5|$|To {{the west}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> the former mill pond. From {{the south side}} a lawn slopes down to another pond beyond which is a small ravine with a stone bridge, this area being known as Killtime. To {{the west of the}} lawn is the sunken Dutch Garden, which was created by William Legh. It {{consists}} of formal flower beds with a central fountain. To the west, south and east of the orangery are further formal flower gardens, including rose gardens.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} localities {{in the area}} are named after the Ashbridges. Just to the south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> Jonathan Ashbridge Park (named after Sarah's son), while {{slightly}} to the east is Sarah Ashbridge Avenue. The bay that marked the southern edge of the property is now known as Ashbridge's Bay, named for John Ashbridge. On the east and north sides of the bay is the large Ashbridge's Bay Park. Ashbridge's Bay Park North, {{to the north of the}} bay, is the site of the Ashbridge's Bay Skate Park, opened in 2009. The west side of the bay is the location of the Ashbridge's Bay Wastewater Treatment Plant, Toronto's main sewage treatment plant and the second largest such facility in Canada.|$|E
50|$|On July 20, 1936, <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> {{measured}} through <b>the</b> Historic American Buildings Survey. On August 21, 1936, architectural drawings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>were</b> prepared. At that time, {{due to a}} city renumbering project, <b>the</b> address <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> 1533 North Fourth Street, Milwaukee. HABS documents {{state that}} <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> then owned by Louise Binzel.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> {{initial address}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>was</b> Danzigerstrasse 53.|$|R
5|$|Auxiliary farm {{buildings}} {{associated with the}} mansion include the original springhouse. To {{the rear of the}} home the oldest section of residence can be seen. The ell consists of four rooms as well as the kitchen and smokehouse. The smokehouse was built as part of the existing structure, and not free standing as is most often seen. The rear ell structure served as the first residence for the family while the primary residence was constructed. To the east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>is</b> the family burial ground. Behind the house is a flower garden. The slave cemetery lies beyond the flower garden. Documented but no longer existing buildings include multiple slave houses, a large stable due-west of the mansion, an ash house, and a garden house.|$|E
