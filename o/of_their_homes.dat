5|$|On August 25, 1863, General Ewing retaliated {{against the}} Confederate guerrillas by issuing General Order No. 11, an {{evacuation}} order that evicted almost 20,000 people from four Missouri counties and burned many <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> The order {{was intended to}} rob the guerrillas of their support network in Missouri. On October 2, a group of 450 guerrillas under Quantrill's leadership met at Blackwater River in Jackson County and left for Texas.|$|E
5|$|The {{perceived}} {{shortcomings of}} the mass housing movement led to efforts to create cost-effective housing solutions that were more varied, more integrated with natural surroundings, and above all more customized to families' needs. In 1973, the Parliament of Norway recommended a shift toward small residential houses rather than large apartment buildings. The Norwegian State Housing Bank (Husbanken) provided citizens {{with the ability to}} fund construction <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes,</b> and an entire construction industry formed to build these needs.|$|E
5|$|Aiming {{to reduce}} {{evidence}} of political failure, Yugoslav authorities sought to disperse the refugees {{in various parts}} of Serbia and prevent their concentration in the capital, Belgrade. The government encouraged the refugees to settle in predominantly Hungarian areas of Vojvodina, and in Kosovo, which was largely populated by Albanians, leading to increased instability in those regions. Even though 20,000 were planned to be settled in Kosovo, only 4,000 moved to the region. After 12 August, the Serbian authorities started to deport some of the refugees who were of military age, declaring them illegal immigrants. They were turned over to the VRS or the ARSK in eastern Croatia for conscription. Some of the conscripts were publicly humiliated and beaten for abandoning the RSK. In some areas, ethnic Croats of Vojvodina were evicted from their homes by the refugees themselves to claim new accommodations. Similarly, the refugees moving through Banja Luka forced Croats and Bosniaks out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b>|$|E

5|$|In nearby Haiti, {{the damage}} from the {{hurricane}} was catastrophic as torrential rains, reported to have exceeded , triggered widespread flooding and landslides throughout the country. Initial reports from Haiti were slow to reach the news media as most roads were flooded or destroyed. Several days after the hurricane's passage, reports began to indicate that immense damage had taken place due to the storm. The city of Gonaïves was completely flooded after a nearby river overflowed its banks. Residents sought safety from the flood waters in the upper floors and roofs <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> Sixteen {{people were killed in}} the city after a bridge was destroyed by the swollen river. The Tonazeau River near Port-au-Prince also topped its banks, inundating nearby areas.|$|E
5|$|India's first {{records of}} {{smallpox}} {{can be found}} in a medical book that dates back to A.D. 400. This book describes a disease that sounds exceptionally like smallpox. India, like China, created a goddess in response to its exposure to smallpox. The Hindu goddess Shitala was both worshipped and feared during her reign. It was believed that this goddess was both evil and kind and had the ability to inflict victims when angered, as well as calm the fevers of the already afflicted. Portraits of the goddess show her holding a broom in her right hand to continue to move the disease and a pot of cool water in the other hand in an attempt to soothe victims. Shrines were created where many India natives, both healthy and not, went to worship and attempt to protect themselves from this disease. Some Indian women, in an attempt to ward off Shitala, placed plates of cooling foods and pots of water on the roofs <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b>|$|E

By February 1999, the Japanese Government had provided Cuba with nearly $1million in disaster funds. An emergency cash grant of $50,000 was also given to Cuba by the United Nations. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized about 8,700 volunteers to assist victims of the storm in the 900 shelters set up throughout the island. Plastic sheeting was to be distributed {{for about a week}} for residents to patch holes in the roof <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> The National Council of Churches sent relief goods valued at $70,000 to the Cuban Government on October9. By February 1999, the Cuban Red Cross distributed over 30,000 sheets of roofing to nearly 5,500 people in three provinces. Several months after the storm, the Cuban Government reported that they had allocated about $38million in funds for Hurricane Georges.|$|E

5|$|Simultaneous {{with the}} {{launching}} of Toan Thang 44, the two battalions of the 3rd Brigade, U.S. 9th Infantry Division, crossed the border 48 kilometers southwest of the Fishhook into an area known as the Dog's Face from 7 through 12 May. The only significant contact with PAVN forces took place near the hamlet of Chantrea, where 51 North Vietnamese were killed and another 21 were captured. During the operation, the brigade lost eight men killed and 22 wounded. It {{was already too late}} for thousands of ethnic Vietnamese murdered by Cambodian persecution, but there were tens of thousands of Vietnamese still within the country who could now be evacuated to safety. South Vietnamese President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu arranged with Lon Nol to repatriate as many as were willing to leave. The new relationship did not, however, prevent the Cambodian government from stripping the Vietnamese <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> and other personal property before they left.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} major {{conflicting}} factions {{present in the}} expansion, all residing in separate areas: the Harbormen of Far Harbor; the synth (synthetic humans) colony of Acadia; and the Church of the Children of Atom. The Harbormen of Far Harbor are led by the town leader, Captain Avery, and seek to reclaim The Island from the fog that has gradually driven them out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes.</b> The Children of Atom live in an old nuclear submarine base called the Nucleus and are led by High Confessor Tektus. Tektus is a fanatical follower of the Church of Atom who seeks to disable or destroy the fog condensers. The refuge for the synth colony of Acadia is an abandoned research center {{at the top of}} The Island; the group are led by a mysterious prototype synth called DiMA. DiMA is friendly to both the Harbormen and the Children so long as Acadia remains autonomous and isolated {{from the rest of the}} world.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 8:45am. While {{the damage to}} Mont Blanc was not severe, it toppled barrels that broke open and flooded the deck with benzol that quickly flowed into the hold. As Imos engines kicked in, she quickly disengaged, which created sparks inside Mont-Blancs hull. These ignited the vapours from the benzol. A fire started at the water line and travelled quickly {{up the side of}} the ship as the benzol spewed out from crushed drums on Mont-Blancs decks. The fire quickly became uncontrollable. Surrounded by thick black smoke, and fearing she would explode almost immediately, the captain ordered the crew to abandon ship. A growing number of Halifax citizens gathered on the street or stood at the windows <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>homes</b> or businesses to watch the spectacular fire. The frantic crew of Mont-Blanc shouted from their two lifeboats to some of the other vessels that their ship was about to explode, but they could not be heard above the noise and confusion. As the lifeboats made their way across the harbour to the Dartmouth shore, the abandoned ship continued to drift and beached herself at Pier 6 near the foot of Richmond street.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to grasp the children's {{recognition}} and directional intention of dwelling house and home life, and to make it useful materials for <b>their</b> education <b>of</b> housing. In this paper, the children(junior high school students and senior high school students) have been inquired <b>of</b> <b>their</b> valuation for <b>their</b> <b>home</b> environment. The following results were obtaind. 1) It is difficult for children to judge <b>of</b> <b>their</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> envirionment which is connected with their parents' opinion, lives that are not customary, convention and vanity. And senior high school students can judge <b>of</b> <b>their</b> evaluation for <b>their</b> <b>home</b> environment which is connected with their parents' opinion and sense of value, more easily than junior high school students. 2) Senior high school students agree to use the dwelling house more openly than junior high school students. But they deny the conventional, flaunting and indifferent tendency <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> environment more than junior high school students. And girls agree to use the dwelling house more openly than boys. 3) Children's valuation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> environment is influenced by the actual condition <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> environment, particularly strongly influensed when their valuation is indistinct. And it has been found that senior high school students' evaluation <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> envirionment in the part where they agree is influrenced by the actual condition <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>home</b> environment more than junior high school students' one. 4) Using th e method of Factor Analysis, it has been found that the structure of senior high school students' evaluation for <b>their</b> <b>home</b> envirionment is different from the structure of junior high school students' one...|$|R
