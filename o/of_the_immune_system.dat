5|$|In 1958 Gustav Nossal and Lederberg {{showed that}} one B cell always {{produces}} only one antibody, {{which was the}} first evidence for clonal selection theory. Burnet wrote further about the theory in his 1959 book The Clonal Selection Theory of Acquired Immunity. His theory predicted almost all of the key features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> as we understand it today, including autoimmune disease, immune tolerance and somatic hypermutation as a mechanism in antibody production. The clonal selection theory became one of the central concepts of immunology, and Burnet regarded his contributions to the theoretical understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> as his greatest contribution to science, writing that he and Jerne should have received the Nobel for this work. Jerne was recognised for his contributions to the conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> when he was a co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in 1984.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{polyclonal}} response confers advantages on {{the immune}} system, in particular, greater probability of reacting against pathogens, it also increases chances of developing certain autoimmune diseases {{resulting from the}} reaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> against native molecules produced within the host.|$|E
5|$|Antibody genes also re-organize in {{a process}} called class {{switching}} that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region. This allows a single antibody {{to be used by}} different types of Fc receptors, expressed on different parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Disorders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> {{can result}} in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either {{be the result of}} a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

50|$|Immunomics {{has made}} this {{approach}} easier by its ability to look at <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> {{as a whole and}} characterize it as a dynamic model. It has revealed that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system’s</b> most distinguishing features are the continuous motility, turnover, and plasticity of its constituent cells. In addition, current genomic technologies, like microarrays, can capture <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> gene expression over time and can trace interactions of microorganisms with cells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innate <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> New, proteomic approaches, including T-cell and B-cells-epitope mapping, can also accelerate the pace at which scientists discover antibody-antigen relationships.|$|R
40|$|Cancer is {{commonly}} {{described as a}} disease of genetic mutations. However, epidemiologic and clinical evidence points to the important but multifaceted role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> host. <b>The</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> {{has something to say}} about cancer evolution through promotion of malignancy by inflammatory myeloid cells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innate <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> In a report in this issue of Cancer Cell, B cells are implicated as key players in <b>the</b> regulation <b>of</b> chronic inflammation that promotes early events in epithelial carcinogenesis. These are surprising observations, linking antibodies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> to innate <b>immune</b> responses that drive epithelial carcinogenesis...|$|R
5|$|Immunodeficiencies {{occur when}} {{one or more}} of the {{components}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> are inactive. The ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> to respond to pathogens is diminished in both the young and the elderly, with immune responses beginning to decline at around 50 years of age due to immunosenescence. In developed countries, obesity, alcoholism, and drug use are common causes of poor immune function. However, malnutrition is the most common cause of immunodeficiency in developing countries. Diets lacking sufficient protein are associated with impaired cell-mediated immunity, complement activity, phagocyte function, IgA antibody concentrations, and cytokine production. Additionally, the loss of the thymus at an early age through genetic mutation or surgical removal results in severe immunodeficiency and a high susceptibility to infection.|$|E
5|$|In humans, the 561 {{amino acid}} EFS protein {{acts as a}} {{scaffolding}} protein for cell signaling based on interactions with SRC, FAK, and other proteins, and {{has been linked to}} roles in the function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> and the development of cancer.|$|E
5|$|Long-term active {{memory is}} {{acquired}} following infection by activation of B and T cells. Active immunity {{can also be}} generated artificially, through vaccination. The principle behind vaccination (also called immunization) is to introduce an antigen from a pathogen in order to stimulate {{the immune system and}} develop specific immunity against that particular pathogen without causing disease associated with that organism. This deliberate induction of an immune response is successful because it exploits the natural specificity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> as well as its inducibility. With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> mankind has developed.|$|E
40|$|Although NK {{cells are}} {{considered}} part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> innate <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> {{a series of}} evidences has demonstrated that they possess characteristics typical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adaptive <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> These NK adaptive features, in particular their memory-like functions, are discussed from an ontogenetic and evolutionary point of view...|$|R
50|$|Some {{publications}} point towards <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> {{deoxycholic acid}} (DCA) as an immunostimulant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-specific <b>immune</b> <b>system,</b> activating its main actors, the macrophages.

5|$|MFGM {{bioactive}} protein components, including the glycoproteins lactadherin, MUC-1, and butyrophilin, {{have been shown}} in preclinical studies to affect immune response. These components influence the immune system by several mechanisms, including interference with microbe adhesion to intestinal epithelia, bacteriocidal action, support of beneficial microbiota, and modulation of other parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity {{depend on the}} ability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> to distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E
5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} the sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to regulate the immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} {{adverse effects of}} long-term weightlessness are muscle atrophy and deterioration of the skeleton, or spaceflight osteopenia. Other significant effects include fluid redistribution, a slowing of the cardiovascular system, decreased production of red blood cells, balance disorders, and a weakening <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> Lesser symptoms include loss of body mass, nasal congestion, sleep disturbance, excess flatulence, and puffiness of the face.

5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the immune system as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to reduce their potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The immune system may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving an arm <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> known as humoral immunity. The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the B-cell to function.|$|E

5|$|Monocytes {{develop in}} the bone marrow and reach {{maturity}} in the blood. Mature monocytes have large, smooth, lobed nuclei and abundant cytoplasm that contains granules. Monocytes ingest foreign or dangerous substances and present antigens to other cells <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system.</b> Monocytes form two groups: a circulating group and a marginal group that remain in other tissues (approximately 70% are in the marginal group). Most monocytes leave the blood stream after 20–40 hours to travel to tissues and organs {{and in doing so}} transform into macrophages or dendritic cells depending on the signals they receive. There are about 500 million monocytes in one litre of human blood.|$|E
5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is a lentivirus (a subgroup of retrovirus) that causes HIV infection and over time acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a condition in humans in which progressive failure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> allows life-threatening opportunistic infections and cancers to thrive. Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV {{is estimated to be}} 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype. Infection with HIV occurs by the transfer of blood, pre-ejaculate, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk. Within these bodily fluids, HIV is present as both free virus particles and virus within infected immune cells.|$|E
5|$|The main {{response}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>immune</b> <b>system</b> to tumors is {{to destroy}} the abnormal cells using killer T cells, sometimes {{with the assistance of}} helper T cells. Tumor antigens are presented on MHC class I molecules in a similar way to viral antigens. This allows killer T cells to recognize the tumor cell as abnormal. NK cells also kill tumorous cells in a similar way, especially if the tumor cells have fewer MHC class I molecules on their surface than normal; this is a common phenomenon with tumors. Sometimes antibodies are generated against tumor cells allowing for their destruction by the complement system.|$|E
