5|$|On March 3, 2006, Williams {{appeared}} <b>on</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>King</b> <b>Live</b> where Paul McCartney {{and then}} wife Heather Mills argued the seal hunt was inhumane because seal cubs were being clubbed to death. Williams said the annual hunt {{is supported by}} scientists, veterinarians and organizations like the UN and the World Wildlife Fund, and that 90% of seals are killed by bullet. Williams accused the McCartneys of being used by IFAW, Greenpeace and PETA to help them raise funds. He then invited the McCartneys to visit Newfoundland and Labrador.|$|E
5|$|In March 2006, Mills and McCartney {{travelled}} to Canada {{to bring}} attention to the country's annual seal hunt.

Their arrival on the floes sparked much attention in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 90 per cent of the sealers live. Mills and McCartney protested against seals being clubbed to death, pierced with boat hooks and sometimes skinned alive. Newfoundland and Labrador's Premier, Danny Williams, debated the issue with them <b>on</b> <b>Larry</b> <b>King</b> <b>Live,</b> the issue being that seals are no longer hunted that way, and have not been for a while. Mills joined a Viva! film team at a pig farm in Somerset, in February 2007, to publicise the use of restrictive farrowing crates, which are used for sows who are suckling piglets.
