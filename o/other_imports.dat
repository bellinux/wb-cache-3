25|$|Gradually {{ditching}} his <b>other</b> <b>imports,</b> Bartolo {{focused on}} purchasing {{large quantities of}} the finest Arabica and Robusta coffee beans from Africa and South America. Once arrived in Gibraltar the beans would be roasted, blended and packaged in-house at the Irish Town merchant house {{into a variety of}} brands to suite different tastes. By this time coffee drinking was becoming increasingly popular and the streets in both Gibraltar and Campo de Gibraltar were teeming with cafés. Although coffee smuggling later declined and eventually ceased to be profitable, the business continued to prosper purely on local trade and Sacarello's brands would soon become famous in Gibraltar and southern Spain.|$|E

500|$|It was {{possible}} to avoid paying the salt tax by making it illegally in salt pans, stealing it from warehouses or smuggling salt from the princely states which remained outside of direct British rule. [...] The latter was {{the greatest threat to}} the company's salt revenues. [...] Much of the smuggled salt came into Bengal from the west and the company decided to act to prevent this trade. [...] In 1803 a series of customs houses and barriers were constructed across major roads and rivers in Bengal to collect the tax on traded salt as well as duties on tobacco and <b>other</b> <b>imports.</b> [...] These customs houses were backed up by [...] "preventative customs houses" [...] located near salt works and the coast in Bengal to collect the tax at source.|$|E
2500|$|In {{preparation}} for D-day, Britain withdrew navicerts in April 1944. [...] At {{this time there}} was a severe shortage of fuel in Ireland. [...] Gas rationing was introduced and there was severe curtailment of rail services. [...] The Minister for Supplies instructed the Arklow schooners to cease <b>other</b> <b>imports</b> and only to import coal. [...] The schooners averted a possible great hardship that winter. [...] By the autumn they had imported 40,000 tons of coal, while bringing food supplies to Britain.|$|E
2500|$|In 1962, Le Château added women's clothing, {{shortened}} {{the name}} to [...] "Le Château", and switched to selling imported European fashions. The store imported from Carnaby Street in London, a fashion centre at the time, as well as <b>other</b> <b>imports</b> such as French suits and Italian turtlenecks. This worked well, {{and within a few}} years, Le Château completely phased out the original traditional clothing style to concentrate on selling fashionable imports to youths. Segal claims that Le Château was the first to introduce bell bottoms to Canada, and had the latest European fashion before it even arrived in New York. Le Château played an integral yet little known role in John Lennon and Yoko Ono's 1969 Montreal bed-in, providing the signature velour jumpsuits worn by the pair. By 1972, the chain grew to 10 stores, {{and by the end of}} the decade Le Château had over 50 stores across Canada. [...] By this time, Le Château had shifted to selling mainstream fashion instead of the latest imports from Europe.|$|E

2500|$|According to Norman Stillman, Antisemitism in the Muslim world {{increased}} greatly {{for more}} than two decades following 1948 but [...] "peaked by the 1970s, and declined somewhat as the slow process of rapprochement between the Arab world and the state of Israel evolved in the 1980s and 1990s". Johannes J. G. Jansen believes that antisemitism will have no future in the Arab world in the long run. In his view, like <b>other</b> <b>imports</b> from the Western World, antisemitism is unable to establish itself in the private lives of Muslims. In 2004 Khaleel Mohammed said, [...] "Anti-Semitism has become an entrenched tenet of Muslim theology, taught to 95 per cent of the religion's adherents in the Islamic world," [...] a claim immediately dismissed as false and racist by Muslim leaders, who accused Mohammed of destroying efforts at relationship building between Jews and Muslims. In 2010, Moshe Ma'oz, Professor Emeritus of Islamic and Middle Eastern Studies at The Hebrew University, edited a book questioning the common perception Islam is antisemitic or anti-Israel, and maintaining that most Arab regimes and most leading Muslim clerics have a pragmatic attitude to Israel.|$|E
2500|$|In 1951-52, Santurce {{finished}} third, winning 16 {{and losing}} 4 {{to finish the}} regular season. In the semifinals they defeated Caguas {{in all of the}} semifinal games, losing the finals to San Juan. Gómez was selected the league's MVP. In 1952-53, the Cangrejeros employed Buster Clarkson as the player-manager. This season marked Roberto Clemente's debut in the league after being signed by Zorilla. The team advanced to the playoffs, where they eliminated the Leones in three games. The finals were against the Senadores, with Santurce winning its second championship in a six-game series. The Cangrejeros {{went on to win the}}ir second Caribbean Series title, with a final record of 5-1. In the 1953-54 season, the Cangrejeros finished last in the standing, but Clemente and Gómez recorded solid performances. The following season, Zorilla and Otero asked permission to the New York Giants and managed to secure a contract for MLB National League MVP Willie Mays, who played centerfield and went on to win the league's MVP and batting title. <b>Other</b> <b>imports</b> included Clarkson, Bob Thurman and George Crowe. After the first month of the season, the team was in the fourth place of the league's standing with a negative record, before winning straight games against the Senadores and Criollos. Despite this change, the team made two releases to contract three reinforcement players, but lost one due to a MLB rule that prohibited the participation of five players from the same team in the winter leagues. On this year's All-Star game, Clemente hit two home runs to give the North team, composed of players from Santurce and San Juan, a victory over the South team. On October 31, 1954, Gómez pitched the league's first shutout, he finished with a record of 13-4 and won the [...] "City Championship" [...] and Caribbean Series title for Santurce. After sweeping their series, the team did not sign any reinforcement prior to the Caribbean Series, being the first time that a team had done so. Five players were included in the event's All-Star lineup, Don Zimmer carried the MVP and the Cangrejeros received a special trophy for winning three Caribbean championships. This version of the Cangrejeros was nicknamed El Escuadrón del Pánico by local newspapers. The team was received by a multitude and they were invited to La Fortaleza. The Cangrejeros signed seven new players for the 1955-56 season, including Orlando Cepeda, José Pagán and Juan Pizarro. They led the league throughout the regular season, winning that phase's title and advanced to the playoffs. Cepeda hit his first home run on October 30, 1955, in a 16-inning loss against the Leones. Despite this success, the team struggled to attract fans, a problem that affected the league for some years with the emergence of television. The other team to advance to the final series was the Criollos, who went on to win after falling behind 1-2.|$|E
60|$|There is {{no doubt}} that our prohibiting the {{importation}} of a particular article, which, but for the prohibition, would have been imported, enables us to obtain our <b>other</b> <b>imports</b> at smaller cost. The article for which we have the greatest demand, and for which our demand is most increased by cheapness, is that which we should naturally import preferably to any other; now of this article we should import the quantity necessary to pay for our exports, on terms of interchange less advantageous to us than in the case of any other commodity. If our legislature prohibits this commodity, the other country will be obliged to offer any other article on easier terms, in order to force a sufficient demand for it to be an equivalent to what she purchases from us.|$|E

60|$|From the {{preceding}} considerations, {{it appears that}} those are greatly in error who contend {{that the value of}} money, in countries where it is an imported commodity, must be entirely regulated by its value in the countries which produce it; and can not be raised or lowered in any permanent manner unless some change has taken place in the cost of production at the mines. On the contrary, any circumstance which disturbs the equation of international demand with respect to a particular country not only may, but must, affect the value of money in that country—its value at the mines remaining the same. The opening of a new branch of export trade from England; an increase in the foreign demand for English products, either by the natural course of events or by the abrogation of duties; a check to the demand in England for foreign commodities, by the laying on of import duties in England or of export duties elsewhere; these and all other events of similar tendency would make the imports of England (bullion and other things taken together) no longer an equivalent for the exports; and the countries which take her exports would be obliged to offer their commodities, and bullion among the rest, on cheaper terms, in order to re-establish the equation of demand; and thus England would obtain money cheaper, and would acquire a generally higher range of prices. A country which, from any of the causes mentioned, gets money cheaper, obtains all its <b>other</b> <b>imports</b> cheaper likewise.|$|E
60|$|The {{first effect}} {{is that the}} article falls in price, and a demand arises for it abroad. This new {{exportation}} disturbs the balance, turns the exchanges, money flows into the country (which we shall suppose to be the United States), and continues to flow until prices rise. This higher range of prices will somewhat check the demand in foreign countries for the new article of export; and will diminish the demand which existed abroad for the other things which the United States was {{in the habit of}} exporting. The exports will thus be diminished; {{while at the same time}} the American public, having more money, will have a greater power of purchasing foreign commodities. If they make use of this increased power of purchase, there will be an increase of imports; and by this, and the check to exportation, the equilibrium of imports and exports will be restored. The result to foreign countries will be, that they have to pay dearer than before for their <b>other</b> <b>imports,</b> and obtain the new commodity cheaper than before, but not so much cheaper as the United States herself does. I say this, being well aware that the article would be actually at the very same price (cost of carriage excepted) in the United States and in other countries. The cheapness, however, of the article is not measured solely by the money-price, but by that price compared with the money-incomes of the consumers. The price is the same to the American and to the foreign consumers; but the former pay that price from money-incomes which have been increased by the new distribution of the precious metals; while the latter have had their money-incomes probably diminished by the same cause. The trade, therefore, has not imparted to the foreign consumer the whole, but only a portion, of the benefit which the American consumer has derived from the improvement; while the United States has also benefited in the prices of foreign commodities. Thus, then, any industrial improvement which leads to the opening of a new branch of export trade benefits a country not only by the cheapness of the article in which the improvement has taken place, but by a general cheapening of all imported products.|$|E
