40|$|We have {{conducted}} static dissolution tests {{to study the}} corrosion behavior of the Environmental Assessment (EA) glass, which is the benchmark <b>glass</b> for high-level <b>waste</b> <b>glasses</b> being produced at US Department of Energy facilities. These tests were conducted to evaluate {{the behavior of the}} EA glass under the same long-term and accelerated test conditions that are being used to evaluate the corrosion of <b>waste</b> <b>glasses.</b> Tests were conducted at 90 C in a tuff groundwater solution at glass surface area/solution volume (WV) ratios of about 2000 and 20, 000 m{sup {minus} 1 }. The glass dissolved at three distinct dissolution rates in tests conducted at 2000 m{sup {minus} 1 }. Based on the release of boron, dissolution within the first seven days occurred {{at a rate of about}} 0. 65 g/(m{sup 2 } {center_dot} d). The rate between seven and 70 days decreased to 0. 009 g/(m{sup 2 } {center_dot} d). An increase in the dissolution rate occurred at longer times after the precipitation of zeolite phases analcime, gmelinite, and an aluminum silicate base. The dissolution rate after phase formation was about 0. 18 g/(m{sup 2 } {center_dot} d). The formation of the same zeolite alteration phases occurred after about 20 days in tests at 20, 000 m{sup {minus}}. The average dissolution rate over the first 20 days was 0. 5 g/(m{sup 2 } {center_dot} d) and the rate after phase formation was about 0. 20 g/(m{sup 2 } {center_dot} d).

This paper discusses a modified statistical sampling and verification approach used to determine the total uncertainty of SWEPP PAN measurements for <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> (content codes 440, 441, and 442) contained in 208 liter drums. In the modified statistical sampling and verification approach, the total performance of the SWEPP PAN nondestructive assay system for specifically selected waste conditions is simulated using computer models. A set of 100 cases covering the known conditions exhibited in <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> was compiled using a combined statistical sampling and factorial experimental design approach.

While the recovery of primary <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> is already spread and technological known, the secondary <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> (<b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> 2) is recovered by few companies in Italy from some years. Consequently the recovery of the waste of this secondary recovery process of <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> is new (<b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> 3) and therefore to optimize, in order to reach an economic and sustainable industrial process solution. With the aim of optimizing the plant of SASIL already existing for the recovery of the "glass waste 3 ", innovative technologies have been studied and executed. The major difficulty is in the automatic separation of materials as plastic lightweight, synthetic stoppers and cork stoppers that can nowadays find a market. In particular the solved problem is the separation for materials whose density is < 1, using non-impacting methods. The particle distribution and characterization of the waste in entrance in plant and the products obtained in different stage of treatment have been used to dimension the new plant and to suggest new kind of treatment. Among the innovative process suggested two density separation have been performed: - separation by means jig concentrators; - separation of new method of bath suction. In this research the jig concentrator, at difference of the previous research don't use floatation principle but only fluid motion (without chemical addition and collectors). The same is for the "bath suction apparatus" that it needs only of water to execute the separation. The separation of efficiencies are major than 80 % both for jig concentrators, for the separation of heavy plastic and glass from plastic lightweight and synthetic stoppers and cork stoppers, and for bath suction apparatus that led to separate plastic lightweight from synthetic stoppers and cork stoppers.

Different kinds of <b>glass</b> <b>wastes</b> in the form of sub grain packaging glass cullet, CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) panel <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> and calsi <b>glass,</b> were used as a sand replacement in AAC production. Large proportion of the post-consumer glass is recycled into the packaging stream again, but some sub grain packaging glass cullet does not meet the strict criteria for packaging glass thus is sent to landfill. CRT is classified as a hazardous <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> and there are several issues surround CRTs which create barriers to increased recovery of the glass. In countries e. g.

Based on our knowledge also calsi glass as a processed blast furnace slag is not used in packaging production. The viability of current and novel applications of mentioned glasses is examined here.

Between suitable materials belongs slag, fly ash, foundry sand and <b>glass</b> <b>waste.</b> The selection based on Lena Chemical s. r. o companies request was selected <b>glass</b> <b>waste.</b> The practical part includes examination as fillers, and the corresponding tests for coating systems with pre-used filler. Finally, {{the assessment of the}} suitability of the materials used...|$|R

[...] 4 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables. This is a {{preliminary}} work for evaluate the promising direction to reuse the recycled vitreous material by the alkaline activation than help {{to produce an}} alternative material with cementitious characteristic. NaOH and NaOH/Na 2 CO 3 solutions were used like activation agents during the alkaline chemical activation of glass waste/blast furnace slag mixtures. The particle size of <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> and nature of alkaline solution were analyzed to identify their influence on the mechanical properties. The NaOH/Na 2 CO 3 solutions showed better performance to activate the blast furnace slag. The mechano-chemical process is an option for dissolve the <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> in an alkaline solution. The alkaline solution formed with the <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> will be use like alkaline activation agent for the blast furnace slag.

40|$|This {{research}} provides possibilities {{to reuse}} solid waste from aluminium scrap recycling factories and municipal solid <b>waste</b> (MSW) container <b>glass</b> {{for the production}} of lightweight aggregates. The aluminium dross residue is increasing along with the increase in the aluminum production. Similarly the problem of container glass rational utilization is a topical problem over the world. The presented research is focused to solve problems concerning to both industrial and municipal waste collection. The production of expanded clay aggregate was simulated in the laboratory with pilot rotary furnace and electric furnace. Expanded clay aggregate was produced with different glass waste: aluminium dross: clay mix ratios, where aluminium dross acted as an extra pore-forming agent and <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> as a fluxing agent. Pore structure was abundant ranging from irregular to spherical, resulting in low apparent density values, which directly was affected with the firing temperature up to 1200 °C and time, controlled with the rotation velocity and furnace incline. The main objectives of this experimental study are {{to examine the effects of}} aluminium dross and <b>glass</b> <b>waste</b> addition to the physical and microstructure properties of expanded clay aggregate sintered on a laboratory scale. Key words: expanded clay aggregate, <b>glass</b> <b>waste,</b> aluminium dros...|$|R
