40|$|A {{great amount}} of {{research}} has been done to study chemical and physical decay of porous materials (brick, stone, and mortar) in aggressive environment, therefore their mechanism of failure is well known. Nevertheless the decay of masonry as a whole, i. e. the influence of mortar joints behaviour on bricks and stones has not been considered enough as a matter of research. The experience of the authors has suggested to study the masonry surface decay due to the environmental condition not only through accelerated ageing tests in laboratory but also on site. The study on site of the decay caused by aggressive agents on existing building is always very difficult. This is due to the impossibility both of following the damage from the beginning and of measuring directly on the surface the level of damage and its progress along the time. For this reason some full-scale models were built and used as <b>on</b> <b>site</b> <b>laboratory.</b> In the environment the masonry deterioration is a process affected by a large randomness. Therefore, the authors have approached it stochastically. The aim of this approach is to obtain information on the durability of masonry material over time and/or on the prediction of a given damage level. This analysis is useful in the planning of maintenance and repair strategies. In accordance to this approach, a simple probabilistic model is proposed...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{aim of the}} {{research}} project is to analyse the potential for the application of lidar and fluorescence techniques in building investigation, and also to establish a scientific remote-sensing method for surveying and analysing the historical facade that is non-destructive and can be used in-situ. The fluorescence lidar method uses point-monitoring and scanning of areas that can provide multispectral images in order to identify materials, biodeteriogens and other substances not visible to the human eye. A specific aim of the project is to develop the method to improve the understanding of our building heritage, conservation and its effects, and to provide a basis for new interventions and maintenance. The main focus of this study has been the built environment with an emphasis on masonry with stone and bricks. Fluorescence techniques are known to be capable of revealing aspects that are not evident to the naked eye or to photography. The lidar technique makes it possible to extend the application of fluorescence spectroscopy to the outdoor environment, remote sensing, with sometimes large distances and uncontrollable background light. This project is an international cooperation involving researchers from different disciplines in Sweden and Italy. Six different case studies are central for this analysis of the application of the technique. The work described in the thesis involves both historical-archival studies and in-situ investigations in Sweden and Italy, as well as laboratory studies on stone material. The fluorescence lidar measurements were made both in-situ on the facades of Övedskloster castle in Sweden, on the amphitheatre Coliseum and on the Lateran Baptistery in Rome, Italy and in laboratory studies on stone and brick samples. The six case studies have been diverse not only in their context and historical background but also with regard to the aims and methods of investigation, measurement and analysis. This has given a differentiated material to work with, although the evaluation of the potential of fluorescence´ lidar has been the main objective. In this first phase, the main work has been to collect and organize data. The data has been obtained through historical and archival studies that have provided a basis and background material for ocular investigations <b>on</b> <b>site,</b> <b>laboratory</b> experiments and the fluorescence lidar measurements. The condition of the stone material in the case studies has varied depending on its history, environment and conservation, but it all showed signs of weathering, exfoliation, chromatic alteration, biodeteriogens etc as well as different restoration and conservation histories. The preliminary analysis from measurement data have used to try to identify phenomena which are not visible to the human eye but which may have an impact in the future, e. g. biodeteriogens on the surface, as well as phenomena that can indicate and support the identification of materials and how to distinguish between them. The ultimate purpose is to evaluate the material from the case studies in order to develop the method as a useful tool for the ongoing maintenance, safeguarding and future conservation of our architectural heritage...|$|E

40|$|Background: In South Africa, stigma, discrimination, social {{visibility}} {{and fear of}} loss of confidentiality impede health facility-based HIV testing. With 50 % of adults having ever tested for HIV in their lifetime, private, alternative testing options are urgently needed. Non-invasive, oral self-tests offer a potential for a confidential, unsupervised HIV self-testing option, but global data are limited. Methods: A pilot cross-sectional study was conducted from January to June 2012 in health care workers based at the University of Cape Town, South Africa. An innovative, unsupervised, self-testing strategy was evaluated for feasibility; defined as completion of self-testing process (i. e., self test conduct, interpretation and linkage). An oral point-of-care HIV test, an Internet and paper-based self-test HIV applications, and mobile phones were synergized to create an unsupervised strategy.

40|$|Context: Regulations for quiet {{urban areas}} are {{typically}} based on sound level limits alone. However, the nonacoustic context may be crucial for subjective soundscape quality. Aims: This study aimed at comparing {{the role of}} sound level and nonacoustic context for subjective urban soundscape assessment {{in the presence of}} the full on-site context, the visual context only, and without context. Materials and Methods: Soundscape quality was evaluated for three recreational urban spaces by using four subjective attributes: loudness, acceptance, stressfulness, and comfort. The sound level was measured at each site and simultaneous sound recordings were obtained. Participants answered questionnaires either <b>on</b> <b>site</b> or during <b>laboratory</b> listening tests, in which the sound recordings were presented with or without each site’s visual context consisting of two pictures. They rated the four subjective attributes along with their preference toward eight sound sources. Results: The sound level was found to be a good predictor of all subjective parameters in the <b>laboratory,</b> but not <b>on</b> <b>site.</b> Although all attributes were significantly correlated in the laboratory setting, they did not necessarily covary <b>on</b> <b>site.</b> Moreover, the availability of the visual context in the listening experiment had no significant effect on the ratings. The participants were overall more positive toward natural sound sources <b>on</b> <b>site.</b> Conclusion: The full immersion in the on-site nonacoustic context may be important when evaluating overall soundscape quality in urban recreational areas. Laboratory evaluations may not fully reflect how subjective loudness, acceptance, stressfulness, and comfort are affected by sound level...|$|R

40|$|Demands {{for energy}} have been {{increasing}} {{in the whole}} world. According to higher consumption, the price of energy rises yearly too. This evokes usage of insulating products in a wider range. By adding insulation, we lower {{the amount of energy}} needed to heat our homes, resulting in fewer associated greenhouse gas emissions and a lower monthly heating bill. Savings depend on insulation thicknesses and on conditions, in which the insulant is kept. Mineral insulation based on stone wool {{is also a member of}} building insulants that defends buildings and constructions against temperature changes of the ambient. However, even when we use modern technologies and building techniques to reduce high energy losses, we can never provide unimpeachable protection of stone wool from damage. During a construction process <b>on</b> a building <b>site</b> or at fast climate changes, it often happens that stone wool is exposed to rain precipitaions or other climate effets. This brings water to the insulating structure. Besides the loss of insulating qualities, the stone wool is left permanently wet.
