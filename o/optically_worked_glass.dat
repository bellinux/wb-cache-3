40|$|Determination of the {{refractive}} index of liquids by the interference microscope {{was made possible}} by the use of a specially constructed holder for the liquid. This ensures a permanent lateral separation between the reference and the object areas and, as the depth of the object area is continuously increasing, a system of fringes is observed. The spacing of the fringes {{is a function of the}} {{refractive index}} of the liquid. By determining this spacing, a measurement of the refractive index is obtained. An accuracy of at least o-ooi in refractive index is obtainable by a single measurement. THE interference microscope makes it possible to measure the opticalpath difference, and thereby the refractive index, of two laterally separated features. In this paper its application as a refractometer for liquids is described. In order to obtain a permanent lateral separation between the liquid and the reference area, a special liquid holder was designed. This consists of two semicircular glass plates whose diametrical surfaces are <b>optically</b> <b>worked</b> and maintained in close mutual contact. A quadrant of one of the plates is <b>optically</b> <b>worked</b> to form a wedge having an angle of approximately 10 degrees (fig. 1) ...|$|R
