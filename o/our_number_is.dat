But Xavier upbraided him with his distrust of God; and said, smiling, to him, [...] "What! are you so dejected for so slight an accident?" [...] After which, they went in company to the shore, where the soldiers belonging to the admiral stood in great consternation for the hazard they had run so lately. The Father reassured them, and exhorted them to remain constant in their holy resolution, notwithstanding their petty misadventure: he remonstrated to them, that heaven had not permitted their admiral to sink, but only to make trial of their faith; neither had themselves been saved from shipwreck, but only that they might perform their vow. In the mean time, the governor held it necessary to summon the great council. All the officers of the town, and the principal inhabitants, were of opinion to give over an enterprize, which, as they thought, was begun rashly, and could have no fortunate conclusion. But the captains and soldiers of the fleet, encouraged by the words of the holy man, and inspired with vigour, which had something in it of more than human, were of a quite contrary judgment. They unanimously protested, that they had rather die than violate that faith, which they had solemnly engaged to Jesus Christ. [...] "For the rest," [...] said they, [...] "what have we more to fear this day than we had yesterday? <b>our</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> not diminished, though we have one vessel less, and we shall fight as well with six foysts, as we should with seven.

He was a young Welshman, who, after having been sold as a slave in Barbadoes, became a sailor of fortune. With about four hundred men he assailed Puerto Bello. [...] "If <b>our</b> <b>number</b> <b>is</b> small," [...] he said, [...] "our hearts are great," [...] and so he assailed the third city and place of arms which Spain then possessed in the West Indies. The {{entrance}} of the harbour was protected by two strong castles, judged as [...] "almost impregnable," [...] while Morgan had no artillery of any avail against fortresses. Morgan had the luck to capture a Spanish soldier, whom he compelled to parley with the garrison of the castle. This he stormed and blew up, massacring all its defenders, while with its guns he disarmed the sister fortress. When all but defeated in a new assault, {{the sight of the}} English colours animated him afresh. He made the captive monks and nuns carry the scaling ladders; in this unwonted exploit the poor religious folk lost many of their numbers. The wall was mounted, the soldiers were defeated, though the Governor fought like a Spaniard of the old school, slew many pirates with his own hand, and pistolled some of his own men for cowardice. He died at his post, refusing quarter, and falling like a gentleman of Spain. Morgan, too, was not wanting in fortitude: he extorted 100,000 pieces-of-eight from the Governor of Panama, and sent him a pistol as a sample of the gun wherewith he took so great a city. He added that he would return and take this pistol out of Panama; nor was he less good than his word. In Cuba he divided 250,000 pieces-of-eight, and a great booty in other treasure. A few weeks saw it all {{in the hands of the}} tavern-keepers and women of the place.|$|E

Determinar la prevalencia del Síndrome de Burnout en los anestesiólogos que laboran en la ciudad de Cuenca y estimar la asociación a: sobrecarga de trabajo, injusticia en el reconocimiento del trabajo desempeñado y ambiente laboral no confortable. Material y métodos. Con un diseño {{transversal}} se recopiló información de los anestesiólogos que desearon participar en el estudio y respondieron el formulario Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), versión HSS (Human Services Survey), Resultados. Se incluyeron 65 anestesiólogos, 61 % varones y 76 % casados. Medianas de: edad 44 (30 a 69), años de ejercicio 10 (1 a 38), anestesias/día 5 (2 a 10) y horas semanales de trabajo 40 (4 a 90). El 98 % considera estresante la especialidad pero 80 % califica al ambiente laboral como bueno. 	La sobrecarga de trabajo fue más prevalente en cansancio emocional [OR 2. 1 (IC 95 % 0. 4 – 9. 9) ] y despersonalización [OR 3. 6 (IC 95 % 0. 6 – 20. 7) ]; la injusticia en el reconocimiento del trabajo en cansancio emocional [OR 13. 3 (IC 95 % 1. 3 – 316. 4) ] y despersonalización [OR 8. 1 (IC 95 % 1. 3 – 63. 01) ] (P < 0. 05) y el ambiente laboral no confortable en cansancio emocional [OR 3. 6 (IC 95 % 0. 5 – 23. 9) ], despersonalización [OR 4. 1 (IC 95 % 0. 7 – 23. 5) ] y falta de realización [OR 3. 8 (IC 95 % 0. 9 – 16. 6) ]. Discusión. La prevalencia del burnout varía según los estudios y nuestra cifra se ubica en el intermedio. La baja realización personal aparece como el dato más relevante en la literatura confrontada y se advierte una relación entre burnout, depresión e ideas suicidas en los anestesiólogos en formaciónObjective. Determine {{the prevalence}} of burnout syndrome in anesthesiologists working {{in the city of}} Cuenca and estimate the association to: work overload, injustice in recognition of the work performed and not comfortable working environment. Material and methods. With a cross-sectional information anesthesiologists working in the city of Cuenca, who wish to participate in the study, which included answering an interview form Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), HSS (Human Services Survey) version in Spanish it was collected, consisting of 22 questions as statements about feelings and attitudes of the professional in his work. Results. 65 anesthesiologists, 61 % male and 76 % were included married. Median: age 44 (30 to 69) years of exercise 10 (1 to 38), anesthesia/day 5 (2 to 10) and 40 hours a week (4 to 90). 98 % considered the specialty stressful but 80 % qualifies as a good work environment. The prevalence of burnout syndrome was 36. 9 % with dimensions: 27 % emotional exhaustion, depersonalization 27 % and 84 % lack of implementation. The workload was more prevalent in emotional distress [OR 2. 1 (95 % CI 0. 4 - 9. 9) ] and depersonalization [OR 3. 6 (95 % CI 0. 6 - 20. 7) ]; injustice in recognition of work in emotional distress [OR 13. 3 (95 % CI 1. 3 - 316. 4) ] and depersonalization [OR 8. 1 (95 % CI 1. 3 - 63. 01) ] (P < 0. 05) and not comfortable working environment in emotional distress [OR 3. 6 (95 % CI 0. 5 - 23. 9) ], depersonalization [OR 4. 1 (95 % CI 0. 7 - 23. 5) ] and failure to carry [OR 3. 8 (95 % CI 0. 9 - 16. 6) ].
