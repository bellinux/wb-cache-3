40|$|Cyanobacteria are {{the only}} prokaryotes known thus far {{possessing}} regulation of physiological functions with approximate daily periodicity, or circadian rhythms, that are controlled by a cluster of three genes, kaiA, kaiB, and kaiC. Here we demonstrate considerably higher genetic polymorphism and extremely rapid evolution of the kaiABC gene family in a filamentous cyanobacterium, Nostoc linckia, permanently exposed to the acute natural environmental stress in the two microsite evolutionary models known as "Evolution Canyons," I (Mount Carmel) and II (Upper Galilee) in Israel. The family consists of five distinct subfamilies (kaiI-kaiV) comprising at least 20 functional genes and pseudogenes. The obtained {{data suggest that the}} duplications of kai genes have adaptive significance, {{and some of them are}} evolutionarily quite recent (≈ 80, 000 years ago).

30|$|Genome {{is shaped}} by two {{evolutionary}} forces: neutrality during demographic history and natural selection. Generally, genetic drift, population growth, migration, and other demographic events affect the whole genome; but natural selection by local environment changes make imprint on episodes or a part of structures of the genome, which could have effects on phenotypes and fitness. Natural selection also changes the frequency of mutations across populations. The advantageous mutations approach to genetic fixation under directional selection; the advantageous heterozygotes are maintained by <b>balancing</b> selection; and <b>purifying</b> selection removes the deleterious mutants. The genetic signatures in genome sequence open a door to detect natural selection.

The <b>balance</b> between blood flow and metabolic activity, both of which can vary spatially and dynamically, suggests that local O(2) availability markedly influences network output. Yet the understanding of the underlying O(2) -sensing mechanisms is limited. Are network responses regulated by discrete O(2) -sensing mechanisms or, rather, are they the consequence of inherent O(2) sensitivities of mechanisms that generate the network activity? We hypothesized that a broad range of O(2) tensions progressively modulates network activity of the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC), a neuronal network critical to the central control of breathing. Rhythmogenesis was measured from the preBötC in transverse neonatal mouse brain stem slices that were exposed to graded reductions in O(2) between 0 and 95 % O(2), producing tissue oxygenation values ranging from 20 ± 18 (mean ± SE) to 440 ± 56 Torr at the slice surface, respectively.

40|$|Because natural {{selection}} {{is likely to}} act on multiple genes underlying a given phenotypic trait, we study here the potential effect of ongoing and past selection on the genetic diversity of human biological pathways. We first show that genes included in gene sets are generally under stronger selective constraints than other genes and that their evolutionary response is correlated. We then introduce a new procedure to detect selection at the pathway level based on a decomposition of the classical McDonald–Kreitman test extended to multiple genes. This new test, called 2 DNS, detects outlier gene sets and takes into account past demographic effects and evolutionary constraints specific to gene sets. Selective forces acting on gene sets can be easily identified by a mere visual inspection {{of the position of}} the gene sets relative to their two-dimensional null distribution. We thus find several outlier gene sets that show signals of positive, <b>balancing,</b> or <b>purifying</b> selection but also others showing an ancient relaxation of selective constraints. The principle of the 2 DNS test can also be applied to other genomic contrasts. For instance, the comparison of patterns of polymorphisms private to African and non-African populations reveals that most pathways show a higher proportion of nonsynonymous mutations in non-Africans than in Africans, potentially due to different demographic histories and selective pressures.

40|$|Osteoclasts are {{the primary}} {{mediators}} of pathological bone resorption in many conditions in which micro-environmental hypoxia is associated with disease progression. However, effects of hypoxia on human osteoclast activity have not been reported. Mature human osteoclasts were differentiated from peripheral blood or obtained from giant cell tumour of bone. Osteoclasts were exposed to a constant hypoxic environment and then assessed for parameters including resorption (toluidine blue staining of dentine slices), membrane integrity (trypan blue exclusion), apoptosis (TUNEL, DAPI), and osteolysis-associated enzyme activity (TRAP, cathepsin K). 24 h exposure to 2 % O(2) produced a 2. 5 -fold increase in resorption associated with increased TRAP and cathepsin K enzyme activity. Hypoxia-Inducible Factor- 1 alpha (HIF- 1 alpha) siRNA completely ablated the hypoxic increase in osteoclast resorption. 24 h at 2 % O(2) also {{increased the number of}} osteoclasts with compromised membrane integrity from 6 % to 21 %, with no change in the total osteoclast number or the proportion of late-stage apoptotic cells. Transient reoxygenation returned the percentage of trypan blue-positive cells to normoxic levels, suggesting that osteoclasts can recover from the early stages of cell death.

40|$|In this thesis, I use coastal {{measurements}} of dissolved O₂ and inert gases to {{provide insight into}} the chemical, biological, and physical processes that impact the oceanic cycles of carbon and dissolved gases. Dissolved O₂ concentration and triple isotopic composition trace net and gross biological productivity. The saturation states of inert gases trace physical processes, such as air-water gas exchange, temperature change, and mixing, that affect all gases. First, I developed a field-deployable system that measures Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe gas ratios in water. It has precision and accuracy of 1 % or better, enables near-continuous measurements, and has much lower cost compared to existing laboratory-based methods. The system will increase the scientific community's access to use dissolved noble gases as environmental tracers. Second, I measured O₂ and five noble gases during a cruise in Monterey Bay, California. I developed a vertical model and found that accurately parameterizing bubble-mediated gas exchange was necessary to accurately simulate the He and Ne measurements. I present the first comparison of multiple gas tracer, incubation, and sediment trap-based productivity estimates in the coastal ocean. Net community production estimated from ¹⁵NO₃⁻ uptake and 02 /Ar gave equivalent results at steady state. Underway O₂/Ar measurements revealed submesoscale variability that was not apparent from daily incubations. Third, I quantified productivity by <b>O₂</b> mass <b>balance</b> and air-water gas exchange by dual tracer (³He/SF₆) release during ice melt in the Bras d'Or Lakes, a Canadian estuary. The gas transfer velocity at > 90 % ice cover was 6 % of the rate for nearly ice-free conditions. Rates of volumetric gross primary production were similar when the estuary was completely ice-covered and ice-free, and the ecosystem was on average net autotrophic during ice melt and net heterotrophic following ice melt. I present a method for incorporating the isotopic composition of H₂O into the O₂ isotope-based productivity calculations, which increases the estimated gross primary production in this study by 46 - 97 %. In summary, I describe a new noble gas analysis system and apply O₂ and inert gas observations in new ways to study chemical, biological, and physical processes in coastal waters. by Cara Charlotte Marie Manning.

40|$|We {{examined}} potential interferences {{from water}} vapor and atmospheric background gases (N 2, O 2, and Ar), and biases by isotopologues of target species, on accurate measurement of atmospheric CO 2 and CH 4 {{by means of}} wavelength-scanned cavity ring-down spectroscopy (WS-CRDS). Changes of the background gas mole fractions in the sample air substantially impacted the CO 2 and CH 4 measurements: variation of CO 2 and CH 4 due to relative increase of each background gas increased as Ar 2 2, suggesting similar relation for the pressure-broadening effects (PBEs) among the background gas. The pressure-broadening coefficients due to variations in O 2 and Ar for CO 2 and CH 4 are empirically determined from these experimental results. Calculated PBEs using the pressure-broadening coefficients are linearly correlated with {{the differences between the}} mole fractions of O 2 and Ar and their ambient abundances. Although the PBEs calculation showed that impact of natural variation of O 2 is negligible on the CO 2 and CH 4 measurements, significant bias was inferred for the measurement of synthetic standard gases. For gas standards <b>balanced</b> with <b>purified</b> air, the PBEs were estimated to be marginal (up to 0. 05 ppm for CO 2 and 0. 01 ppb for CH 4) although the PBEs were substantial (up to 0. 87 ppm for CO 2 and 1. 4 ppb for CH 4) for standards balanced with synthetic air. For isotopic biases on CO 2 measurements, we compared experimental results and theoretical calculations, which showed excellent agreement within their uncertainty. We derived instrument-specific water correction functions empirically for three WS-CRDS instruments (Picarro EnviroSense 3000 i, G- 1301, and G- 2301), and evaluated the transferability of the water correction function from G- 1301 among these instruments. Although the transferability was not proven, no significant difference was found in the water vapor correction function for the investigated WS-CRDS instruments as well as the instruments reported in the past studies within the typical analytical precision at sufficiently low water concentrations (2 and 4). For accurate measurements of CO 2 and CH 4 in ambient air, we concluded that WS-CRDS measurements should be performed under complete dehumidification of air samples, or moderate dehumidification followed by application of a water vapor correction function, along with calibration by natural air-based standard gases or purified air-balanced synthetic standard gases with the isotopic correction...|$|R

The enigma of genotypic-phenotypic {{diversity and}} biodiversity evolution of genes, genomes, phenomes, and biomes, reviewed here, was central {{in the research}} program of the Institute of Evolution, University of Haifa, since 1975. We explored the following questions. (i) How much of the genomic and phenomic diversity in nature is adaptive and processed by natural selection? (ii) What is the origin and evolution of adaptation and speciation processes under spatiotemporal variables and stressful macrogeographic and microgeographic environments? We advanced ecological genetics into ecological genomics and analyzed globally ecological, demographic, and life history variables in 1, 200 diverse species across life, thousands of populations, {{and tens of thousands}} of individuals tested mostly for allozyme and partly for DNA diversity. Likewise, we tested thermal, chemical, climatic, and biotic stresses in several model organisms. Recently, we introduced genetic maps and quantitative trait loci to elucidate the genetic basis of adaptation and speciation. The genome–phenome holistic model was deciphered by the global regressive, progressive, and convergent evolution of subterranean mammals. Our results indicate abundant genotypic and phenotypic diversity in nature. The organization and evolution of molecular and organismal diversity in nature at global, regional, and local scales are nonrandom and structured; display regularities across life; and are positively correlated with, and partly predictable by, abiotic and biotic environmental heterogeneity and stress. Biodiversity evolution, even in small isolated populations, is primarily driven by natural selection, including diversifying, <b>balancing,</b> cyclical, and <b>purifying</b> selective regimes, interacting with, but ultimately overriding, the effects of mutation, migration, and stochasticity...|$|R
40|$|Serotonin, {{a hormone}} {{produced}} in the brain, has long been implicated in the regulation of critical behaviors, such as those related to aggression or impulse control. However, most research on serotonin {{has focused on the}} proximate connection to behavior, and little is known about its evolution. This is unfortunate, since the serotonin system has great potential to inform our understanding of behavioral evolution. I seek to address this gap in knowledge by investigating the molecular evolution of the serotonin system in macaques (genus Macaca). 	The macaque genus represents a useful model for understanding behavioral evolution. Comprised of approximately 19 species, macaques display a wide range of behaviors. It is likely that behavioral differences are caused by differences in neuroendocrinology. Therefore, the serotonin system provides one potential mechanism through which evolution may act to shape macaque behavior. In this dissertation, I sequence four genes that are known to influence serotonin functioning and behavior: HTR 1 A, HTR 1 B, TPH 2, and SLC 6 A 4. I examine the pattern of genetic variation within and between several species of macaque, and, using an approach based on molecular evolutionary theory, discern which evolutionary force ??? positive selection, <b>balancing</b> selection, <b>purifying</b> selection, or random genetic drift ??? is most likely to have acted on these genes. Three out of the four genes (HTR 1 B, TPH 2, and SLC 6 A 4), show a low level of overall genetic variation within the coding regions, suggesting that purifying selection is the predominate force acting on these genes. Within non-coding regions, the patterns of genetic variation found are consistent with genetic drift. Thus, positive selection {{does not seem to be}} affecting these genes. The genetic variation for these genes may contribute to the behavioral variation found in macaques; however, any effect that these genes have on behavior is likely due to non-adaptive evolutionary forces. In contrast to the other genes, HTR 1 A shows a pattern that is clearly distinct. HTR 1 A displays an unusually high level of interspecific variation, which is consistent with positive selection. Moreover, a subset of macaque species share a codon loss, an extremely rare event in gene evolution, and analyses of the coding region indicate a significant elevation of protein evolution among certain sites of the gene. These results suggest that positive selection has played a significant role in the evolution of the serotonin system and it is likely that the effects of positive selection on HTR 1 A contributed to macaque behavioral evolution. This research provides an important first step towards gaining a more thorough understanding of the mechanisms underlying the evolution of behavior...|$|R
