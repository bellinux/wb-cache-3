40|$|The <b>orange</b> <b>coral</b> Astroides calycularis is internationally {{protected}} due to {{its narrow}} distribution, its sensitivity to environmental changes and anthropogenic disturbance. Spatio-temporal macrofaunal assemblages associated with A. calycularis were studied along the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula. A total of 878 invertebrate specimens were collected, comprising 81 species. At the 3 depths studied (0, 5 and 10 m), crustacean species were dominant in terms of abundance, followed by annelids and molluscs. Macrofaunal densities were higher in October and May, and lower in August and September. Janira maculosa (isopod), Lembos spp. (gammarid) and Stenothoe cavimana (gammarid) were the most abundant species, present in almost all depths and months. ANOVA analyses by month reflected significant differences in species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity, but no differences among depth ranges and no interaction between time and depth. PERMANOVA analyses showed {{significant differences in the}} associated macrofauna for time and depth, but no interaction was observed between these factors. These results indicate the ecological relevance of this Mediterranean scleractinian coral as a habitat for many macrofaunal groups. Furthermore, the conservation of this endangered species contributes to the preservation of high marine biodiversity. Junta de Andalucí...|$|E

Molecular markers are useful tools as indirect estimators of these characteristics. In this study, we assess the population genetic structure of the <b>orange</b> <b>coral</b> Astroides calycularis in the Alboran Sea at local and regional scale, and at three localities outside of this basin. Bayesian clustering methods, traditional F-statistics and D est statistics {{were used to determine}} the patterns of genetic structure. Likelihood and coalescence approaches were used to infer migration patterns and effective population sizes. The results obtained reveal a high level of connectivity among localities separated by as much as 1 km and moderate levels of genetic differentiation among more distant localities, somewhat corresponding with a stepping-stone model of gene flow and connectivity. These data suggest that connectivity among populations of this coral is mainly driven by the biology of the species, with low dispersal abilities; in addition, hydrodynamic processes, oceanographic fronts and the distribution of rocky substrate along the coastline may influence larval dispersal. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

50|$|The game {{is played}} on 2, 3, or 4 {{separate}} boards, depending {{on the number of}} players, on which the players attempt to grow corals to feed to their parrotfish. Board space is limited, so the players' corals compete with one another for space. Corals are grown by placing polyp tiles on the board. The corals come in five different colors, and each color is weak or strong relative to each of the other colors—for example, red corals may be stronger than <b>orange.</b> Strong <b>corals</b> may overgrow weak ones, allowing the player who placed the tiles to consume the overgrown tiles. Consumed polyp tiles are strategically important, as they are required to perform certain actions and can allow a player to grow corals faster than would be possible otherwise. This hierarchy changes throughout the course of the game. All polyp tiles in a coral must be the same color.|$|R
40|$|Ocean acidification, the {{assimilation}} of atmospheric CO 2 by the oceans that decreases the pH and CaCO 3 saturation state (& Omega;) of seawater, is projected to have severe adverse consequences for calcifying organisms. While strong evidence suggests calcification by tropical reef-building corals containing algal symbionts (zooxanthellae) will decline over the next century, likely responses of azooxanthellate corals to ocean acidification are less well understood. Because azooxanthellate corals do not obtain photosynthetic energy from symbionts, they provide a system for studying the direct effects of acidification on energy available for calcification. The solitary azooxanthellate <b>orange</b> cup <b>coral</b> Balanophyllia elegans often lives in low-pH, upwelled waters along the California coast. In an 8 -month factorial experiment, we measured the effects of three pCO 2 treatments (410, 770, and 1220 μatm) and two feeding frequencies (3 -day and 21 -day intervals) on "planulation" (larval release) by adult B. elegans, and on the survival, skeletal growth, and calcification of newly settled juveniles. Planulation rates were affected by food level but not pCO 2. Juvenile mortality was highest under high pCO 2 (1220 μatm) and low food (21 -day intervals). Feeding rate had {{a greater impact on}} calcification of B. elegans than pCO 2. While net calcification was positive even at 1220 μatm (∼ 3 times current atmospheric pCO 2), overall calcification declined by ∼ 25 - 45 %, and skeletal density declined by ∼ 35 - 45 % as pCO 2 increased from 410 to 1220 μatm. Aragonite crystal morphology changed at high pCO 2, becoming significantly shorter but not wider at 1220 μatm. We conclude that food abundance is critical for azooxanthellate coral calcification, and that B. elegans may be partially protected from adverse consequences of ocean acidification in habitats with abundant heterotrophic food. © Author(s) 2013.

40|$|Ocean acidification, the {{assimilation}} of atmospheric CO 2 by the oceans that decreases the pH and CaCO 3 saturation state (Ω) of seawater, is projected to have severe consequences for calcifying organisms. Strong evidence suggests that tropical reef-building corals containing algal symbionts (zooxanthellae) will experience dramatic declines in calcification over the next century. The responses of azooxanthellate corals to ocean acidification are less well understood, and because they cannot obtain extra photosynthetic energy from symbionts, they provide a system for studying the direct effects of acidification on the energy available for calcification. The <b>orange</b> cup <b>coral</b> Balanophyllia elegans is a solitary, azooxanthellate scleractinian species common on the California coast where it thrives in the low pH waters of an upwelling regime. During an 8 month study, we addressed the effects of three p CO 2 treatments (410, 770, and 1230 μatm) and two feeding frequencies (High Food and Low Food) on adult Balanophyllia elegans planulation (larval release) rates, and on the survival, growth, and calcification of their juvenile offspring. Planulation rates were affected by food level but not p CO 2, while juvenile survival was highest under 410 μatm and High Food conditions. Our results suggest that feeding rate has {{a greater impact on}} calcification of B. elegans than p CO 2. Net calcification was positive even at 1230 μatm (~ 3 times current atmospheric p CO 2), although the increase from 410 to 1230 μatm reduced overall calcification by ~ 25 – 45 %, and reduced skeletal density by ~ 35 – 45 %. Higher p CO 2 also altered aragonite crystal morphology significantly.

40|$|Artificial reefs {{created by}} {{deliberately}} sinking ships {{off the coast}} of the Florida Keys island chain are providing new habitat for marine invertebrates. This newly developing fouling community includes the previously reported invasive <b>orange</b> tube <b>coral</b> Tubastraea coccinea and the non-native giant foam oyster Hyotissa hyotis. New SCUBA-based surveys involving five shipwrecks spanning the upper, middle, and lower Florida Keys, show T. coccinea now also established in the lower Keys and H. hyotis likewise extending to new sites. Two additional mollusks found on the artificial reefs, the amathinid gastropod Cyclothyca pacei and gryphaeid oyster Hyotissa mcgintyi, the latter also common in the natural reef areas, are discussed as potentially non-native. A new species of sessile, suspension-feeding, worm-snail, Thylacodes vandyensis Bieler, Rawlings & Collins n. sp. (Vermetidae), is described from the wreck of the USNS Vandenberg off Key West and discussed as potentially invasive. This new species is compared morphologically and by DNA barcode markers to other known members of the genus, and may be a recent arrival from the Pacific Ocean. Thylacodes vandyensis is polychromatic, with individuals varying in both overall head-foot coloration and mantle margin color pattern. Females brood stalked egg capsules attached to their shell within the confines of their mantle cavity, and give rise to crawl-away juveniles. Such direct-developing species have the demonstrated capacity for colonizing habitats isolated far from their native ranges and establishing rapidly growing founder populations. Vermetid gastropods are common components of the marine fouling community in warm temperate and tropical waters and, as such, have been tagged as potentially invasive or with a high potential to be invasive in the Pacific Ocean. As vermetids can influence coral growth/composition in the Pacific and have been reported serving as intermediate hosts for blood flukes of loggerhead turtles, such new arrivals in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary are of concern. Growing evidence indicates that artificial reefs can act as permanent way-stations for arriving non-natives, providing nurseries within which populations may grow in an environment with reduced competition compared to native habitats. Consequently, artificial reefs can act as sentinels for the appearance of new species. Ongoing monitoring of the developing molluscan fauna on the artificial reefs of the Florida Keys is necessary to recognize new invasions and identify potential eradication targets, thereby assuring the health of the nearby natural barrier reef...|$|R
