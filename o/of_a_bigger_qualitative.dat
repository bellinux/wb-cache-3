40|$|In most Initial Teacher Preparation (ITP) programmes, {{learning}} in teaching placements {{is considered to}} be an important component for providing workplace learning experiences to develop the skills <b>of</b> being <b>a</b> teacher. This paper is based on <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>qualitative</b> study which explored the learning experiences <b>of</b> <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> in-service student vocational teachers prior to and during their one-year ITP programme in Brunei. The study examined these student teachers’ dispositions to learning as revealed through their experiences on different placements during their training. The findings of this paper highlight the importance of the student vocational teachers’ roles and positions relative to their teaching placements. Theoretically, the findings also extend Bourdieu’s thinking, where existing cultural capital in the form of subject knowledge which is valued in one context does not necessarily help the learning of individuals in becoming a vocational teacher in another context. In addition, the paper argues for a need to reconceptualise in-service teacher education, more specifically, the workplace learning aspect. Lastly, it concludes with recommendations to support these student teachers in their placements through creating more expansive learning environments...|$|R

40|$|As we face {{higher numbers}} of {{material}} layers in the increasingly complex Microsystems, the rating of layers reliability {{has to keep}} pace. Fracture mechanical descriptions are <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>qualitative</b> improvement when using simulation for design and reliability support, especially when looking at layer delamination. In order to simulate the interfacial fracture we urgently need to find empirical parameters, because the fracture parameters have to be verified as critical. Such experiments are difficult to carry out at the Silicon-to-Epoxy Molding Compound (EMC) interface. We {{are now able to}} do such investigations using the Mixed Mode Chisel (MMC) setup. In this paper we compare results of the Silicon-EMC interface for the in- and exclusion of thermal residual stresses in the simulations. The interface specimens are of package scale and are derived from the embedded wafer level molding process. We find the impact of thermal residual stresses crucial for the validity of fracture toughness values, and show relations to consider when using the MMC setup. We do not find any EMC residuals on the delaminated Silicon surface...|$|R

40|$|Many weakly {{interacting}} sub-electronVolt particles (WISPs) {{are easily}} accommodated in {{extensions of the}} standard model. Generally the strongest bounds on their existence come from stellar evolution and cosmology, where {{to the best of}} our knowledge observations seem to agree with the standard budget of particles. In this talk I review the most demanding constraints for axions and axion-like-particles, hidden photons and mini-charged particles. There is little doubt in the particle physics community about the need of complementing the already very successful standard model (SM) to pursue a completely satisfactory final theory of elementary particles. On the other hand, and with the exception of the dark matter, our increasingly precise knowledge of the universe shows no trace of physics beyond the SM. If new light particles exist they should be very weakly interacting, probably only accessible to extremely precise experiments. Experiments such as the ones presented in this conference. Astrophysics and cosmology are often strong probes of weakly interacting particles. The reason is clear: the huge magnitudes of the typical sizes, time scales, densities or temperatures in the early universe or in stars can convert a tiny “microscopic ” effect in <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>qualitative</b> change in the evolution of the whole system. This conclusion is specially emphasized whe...|$|R
