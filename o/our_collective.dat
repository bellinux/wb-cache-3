This includes three of Engelbart's key papers, edited into book form by Yuri Rubinsky and Christina Engelbart to commemorate the presentation of the 1995 SoftQuad Web Award to Doug Engelbart at the World Wide Web conference in Boston in December 1995. Only 2,000 softcover copies were printed, and 100 hardcover, numbered and signed by Engelbart and Tim Berners-Lee. Engelbart's book is now being republished by the Doug Engelbart Institute.|$|E

A revolutionary mass movement is different from the traditional revisionist mass base of [...] "sympathizers". Rather it is akin to the Red Guard in China, based on the full participation and involvement of masses of people in the practice of making revolution; a movement with a full willingness to participate in the violent and illegal struggle.|$|R

25|$|Ceres, as the Goddess who has {{control over}} nature's {{resources}} and cycles, may astrologically {{be considered the}} planet of the Environment. Returning to mythology, an early environmental villain is the figure of Erysichthon, the tearer up of the earth, who cut down trees in a grove sacred to Ceres-Demeter, {{for which he was}} punished by the goddess with fearful hunger. In this sense Ceres became an emerging archetype in the awareness of recent climate change, and is entering <b>our</b> <b>collective</b> consciousness as a {{need to take care of}} our natural and irreplaceable resources in the 21st century. Ceres represents a leap towards a future of ecological responsibility and knowledge. As an indicator for environmental or community activism, Ceres would represent for some astrologers the wave of the future.|$|E

To combat proliferation, ElBaradei has suggested keeping nuclear and radiological material {{out of the hands of}} extremist groups, tightening control over the operations for producing the nuclear material that could be used in weapons, and accelerating disarmament efforts. ElBaradei also stated that only one percent of the money spent to develop new weapons would be enough to feed the entire world and that, if we hope to escape self-destruction, nuclear weapons should have no place in <b>our</b> <b>collective</b> conscience and no role in our security.|$|E

500|$|Leatherface {{has gained}} a {{reputation}} as a significant character in the horror genre, responsible for establishing the use of conventional tools as murder weapons and the image of a large, silent killer devoid of personality. Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com said, [...] "In <b>our</b> <b>collective</b> consciousness, Leatherface and his chainsaw have become as iconic as Freddy and his razors or Jason and his hockey mask." [...] Don Sumner called The Texas Chain Saw Massacre a classic that not only introduced a new villain to the horror pantheon but also influenced an entire generation of filmmakers. According to Rebecca Ascher-Walsh of Entertainment Weekly, it laid the foundations for future horror franchises such as Halloween, The Evil Dead, and The Blair Witch Project. Ridley Scott cited it as an inspiration for his 1979 film Alien. French director Alexandre Aja credited it as an early influence on his career. Horror filmmaker and heavy metal musician Rob Zombie sees it as a major influence on his art, most notably his 2003 film House of 1000 Corpses.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundCurrent {{guidelines}} {{for breast cancer}} treatment recommend completion axillary lymph node dissection (CALND) following in case of positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis, which only in 35 %– 70 % shows additional nodal metastases. Several nomograms and scoring systems have been created to predict the risk of metastasis in non-SLNs. The aim {{of the study was}} to identify individual patient risk for non-sentinel lymph node metastasis by validating with MSKCC nomogram and to evaluate the variability within a group of SLN-positive breast cancer patients with the final goal of avoiding unnecessary CALND. Patients and methodsWe retrospectively evaluated 1496 primary breast cancer patients. 324 women with a positive SLN who underwent CALND were identified. The predictive accuracy was measured and compared with the MSKCC nomogram by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn on the basis of the sensitivity and specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. ResultsAt least one metastatic non-SLN were identified in 88 / 324 (27. 2 %) patients. Tumor size, tumor type, tumor grade, number of positive SLNs and number of negative SLNs were significantly associated with non-SLN status in multivariate analyses. The MSKCC nomogram showed an AUC value of 0. 738 (95 % confidence interval =  0. 682 – 0. 793) after the validation for <b>our</b> <b>collectives.</b> ConclusionsThe MSKCC nomogram showed a good prediction for the non-SLN metastasis and performed adequately in <b>our</b> patient <b>collective.</b> Therefore, for the use of nomogram, validation with other populations of patients is strongly suggested...|$|R

On behalf of The Village Voice, Drew Hinshaw criticized Aguilera's vocals and lyrics on the song. Likewise, Dan Martin from NME opined that with the new musical style of Bionic and its lead single, Aguilera had very little chance to explore her vocal ability. Writing for Drowned in Sound, Richard Wink concerned that [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] showcased an [...] "apparent identity crisis" [...] that Aguilera experienced during the production of Bionic; he questioned whether the alter ego [...] "Xtina" [...] was [...] "the character that represents a freewheeling, risk taking, carefree party girl" [...] or the contrasting [...] "mask a desperate popstar wears when they are struggling to maintain relevance".|$|E

Cameron's sympathies, and the movie's, clearly are with the Na'vi—and against the military and corporate men."

Armond White of New York Press dismissed the film as [...] "essentially a sentimental cartoon with a pacifist, naturalist message" [...] that uses villainous Americans to misrepresent the facts of the military, capitalism, and imperialism. [...] Answering critiques of the film as insulting to the U.S. military, a piece in the Los Angeles Times asserted that [...] "if any U.S. forces that ever existed were being insulted, it was the ones who fought under George Armstrong Custer, not David Petraeus or Stanley McChrystal."

40|$|Under the {{direction}} of Dr. Frank Mueller.) Massive multi-core embedded processors with network-on-chip (NoC) architectures are becoming common. These architectures provide higher processing capability due to an abundance of cores. They provide native core-to-core communication that can be exploited via message passing to provide system scalability. Despite these advantages, multicores pose predictability challenges that can affect both performance and real-time capabilities. In this work, we develop efficient and predictable group communication using message passing specifically designed for large core counts in 2 D mesh NoC architectures. We have implemented {{the most commonly used}} collectives {{in such a way that}} they incur low latency and high timing predictability making them suitable for balanced parallelization of scalable highperformance systems and real-time systems alike. Experimental results on a 64 core hardware platform show that <b>our</b> <b>collectives</b> can significantly reduce communication times by up to 95 % for single packet messages and up to 98 % for longer messages with superior performance for sometimes all message sizes and sometimes only small message sizes depending on the group primitive.
