2500|$|The {{condition}} of the material at hand determines what type of abrasive will be applied. The first stage, if the material is unfinished, starts with a rough abrasive (perhaps 60 or 80 grit) and each subsequent stage uses a finer abrasive, such as 120, 180, 220/240, 320, 400 and higher grit abrasives, until the desired finish is achieved. The rough (i.e. large grit) passes remove imperfections within the metal surface like pits, nicks, lines and scratches. The finer abrasives leave progressively finer lines that are not {{visible to the naked}} eye. To achieve a #8 Finish (Mirror) it requires polishing and buffing compounds, polishing wheels and high speed polishing machines or <b>other</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> {{that can be used for}} polishing, like an electrical drill. Lubricants like wax and kerosene may be used as lubricating and cooling media during these operations, although some polishing materials are specifically designed to be used [...] "dry." [...] Buffing may be done by hand with a stationary polisher or die grinder, or it may be automated using specialized equipment.|$|E

50|$|During the Industrial Revolution, {{mechanized}} {{power generated}} by water wheels or steam engines was {{transmitted to the}} lathe via line shafting, allowing faster and easier work. Metalworking lathes evolved into heavier machines with thicker, more rigid parts. Between the late 19th and mid-20th centuries, individual electric motors at each lathe replaced line shafting as the power source. Beginning in the 1950s, servomechanisms were applied to the control of lathes and <b>other</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> via numerical control, which often was coupled with computers to yield computerized numerical control (CNC). Today manually controlled and CNC lathes coexist in the manufacturing industries.|$|E

50|$|A lathe is a <b>machine</b> <b>tool</b> used principally for shaping {{pieces of}} metal, wood, or other {{materials}} by causing the workpiece {{to be held}} and rotated by the lathe while a tool bit is advanced into the work causing the cutting action. Lathes {{can be divided into}} three types for easy identification: engine lathe, turret lathe, and special purpose lathes. Some smaller ones are bench mounted and semi-portable. The larger lathes are floor mounted and may require special transportation if they must be moved.Field and maintenance shops generally use a lathe that can be adapted to many operations and that is not too large to be moved from one work site to another. The engine lathe is ideally suited for this purpose. A trained operator can accomplish more machining jobs with the engine lathe than with any <b>other</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tool.</b> Turret lathes and special purpose lathes are usually used in production or job shops for mass production or specialized parts, while basic engine lathes are usually used for any type of lathe work.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose to use Gaussian {{processes}} for classification (GPC) for solving the channel equalization problem.

50|$|Around 1840, the North Midland Railway, the Midland Counties Railway and the Birmingham and Derby Railway set up {{workshops}} to {{the rear}} of Derby station. Although the Midland Counties had an engine house at Nottingham, the main facilities for all three lines appear to have been, initially at least, those at Derby. That for the Birmingham and Derby was next to its line, near London Road. It was about 140 ft long and 43 ft wide, with three lines and three wide archways at its entrance, supporting a water tank. In one corner was a smithy. The Midland Counties' shed was rectangular and about 800 ft long {{to the north of the}} site.

50|$|Samuel Bentham {{developed}} a shaper between 1791 and 1793. However, Roe (1916) credits James Nasmyth with {{the invention of}} the shaper in 1836. Shapers were very common in industrial production from the mid-19th century through the mid-20th. In current industrial practice, shapers have been largely superseded by <b>other</b> <b>machine</b> <b>tools</b> (especially of the CNC type), including milling machines, grinding machines, and broaching machines. But the basic function of a shaper is still sound; tooling for them is minimal and very cheap to reproduce; and they are simple and robust in construction, making their repair and upkeep easily achievable. Thus they are still popular in many machine shops, from jobbing shops or repair shops to tool and die shops, where only one or a few pieces are required to be produced and the alternative methods are cost- or tooling-intensive. They also have considerable retro appeal to many hobbyist machinists, who are happy to obtain a used shaper or, in some cases, even to build a new one from scratch.|$|E
