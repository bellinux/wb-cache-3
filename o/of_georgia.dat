5|$|The Great Depression {{threatened}} the already tentative nature <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech's funding. In {{a speech on}} April 27, 1930, Brittain proposed that the university system be reorganized under a central body, rather than having each university under its own board. As a result, the Georgia General Assembly and Governor Richard Russell, Jr. passed an act in 1931 that established the University System <b>of</b> <b>Georgia</b> and the corresponding Georgia Board of Regents; unfortunately for Brittain and Georgia Tech, the board was composed almost entirely of graduates of the University <b>of</b> <b>Georgia.</b> In its final act on January 7, 1932, the Tech Board of Trustees {{sent a letter to}} the chairman of the Georgia Board of Regents outlining its priorities for the school. The Depression also affected enrollment, which dropped from 3,271 in 1931–1932 to a low of 2,482 in 1933–1934, and only gradually increased afterwards. It also caused a decrease in funding from the State <b>of</b> <b>Georgia,</b> which in turn caused a decrease in faculty salaries, firing of graduate student assistants, and a postponing of building renovations.|$|E
