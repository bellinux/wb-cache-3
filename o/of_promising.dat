5|$|Ponsford {{was named}} captain of a Victorian side made of up <b>of</b> <b>promising</b> youngsters, {{to play against}} Tasmania at the MCG on 2–5 February 1923. In this, only his third {{first-class}} match, Ponsford broke the world record for the highest individual innings score at that level {{on the final day}} of the match, scoring 429runs and batting for nearly eight hours. Along the way, he broke Armstrong's record for the highest score for Victoria (250), before surpassing former England captain Archie MacLaren's world record individual score of 424. The team score of 1,059 was also a new record for a first-class innings—an impromptu paint job was needed to show the score on a board that was not designed to display a four-figure total.|$|E

5|$|The {{demand for}} {{consistency}} between a quantum description {{of matter and}} a geometric description of spacetime, {{as well as the}} appearance of singularities (where curvature length scales become microscopic), indicate the need for a full theory of quantum gravity: for an adequate description of the interior of black holes, and of the very early universe, a theory is required in which gravity and the associated geometry of spacetime are described in the language of quantum physics. Despite major efforts, no complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity is currently known, even though a number <b>of</b> <b>promising</b> candidates exist.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} summer, Trott again {{acted as a}} Test selector, along with the incumbent Test captain George Giffen and former captain Percy McDonnell. When choosing the Australian team for the previous tour of England, Giffen used his influence to ensure the selection of his younger brother, Walter. The team chosen for the 1896 tour of England included a number <b>of</b> <b>promising</b> young players, including Joe Darling and Clem Hill, both of whom went on to captain Australia. Albert Trott was a controversial omission, in light of performances in the previous Ashes series, but he accompanied the team on their voyage and later settled in England. He had a successful career with Middlesex and appeared for England in two Test matches against South Africa. The cricket historian David Frith records that when the Trott brothers encountered each other on an English street, they merely exchanged acknowledging nods and kept walking.|$|E
5|$|It {{had long}} been Markham's {{practice}} to take note <b>of</b> <b>promising</b> young naval officers who might later be suitable for polar responsibilities, should the opportunity arise. He had first observed Midshipman Robert Falcon Scott in 1887, while the latter was serving with HMS Rover in St Kitts, and had remembered him. Thirteen years later, Scott, by now a Torpedo Lieutenant on , {{was looking for a}} path to career advancement, and a chance meeting with Sir Clements in London led him to apply for the leadership of the expedition. Scott {{had long been}} in Markham's mind, though by no means always his first choice, but other favoured candidates had either become in his view too old, or were no longer available. With Markham's determined backing, Scott's appointment was secured by 25 May 1900, followed swiftly by his promotion to Commander.|$|E

The main plot was harvested in five different harvesting dates including: HarD 1 = Harvesting at physiological maturity of crop, HarD 2 = 7 days after the first harvesting <b>of</b> each <b>promising</b> line, HarD 3 = 15 days after the first harvesting <b>of</b> each <b>promising</b> line, HarD 4 = 21 days after the first harvesting <b>of</b> each <b>promising</b> line, HarD 5 = 30 days after the first harvesting <b>of</b> each <b>promising</b> line. The difference of grain yield (kg/ha) <b>of</b> each <b>promising</b> line in different harvesting dates with compare to its grain yield (kg/ha) in first harvesting date (HarD 1 -HarDi) were measured as indices of shattering.

In the present experiment, the promising line 12 CBN 008 & 10 CBN 004 had grain yield 1089 kg/ha & 897 kg/ha respectively.

25|$|From {{mathematical}} {{point of}} view ligand docking represents a search for global minimum on the multidimensional surface describing the free energy of protein-ligand binding. With ligands having up to 15-20 degrees of freedom (freely rotatable bonds) and complex nature of energy surface, global optimum search represents generally unsolved scientific task. To tackle this computationally challenging problem Lead-Finder applies unique approach combining genetic algorithm search, local optimization procedures, and a smart exploitation of the knowledge generated during the search run. Rational combination of different optimization strategies makes Lead Finder efficient in terms of coarse sampling of ligand's phase space and refinement <b>of</b> <b>promising</b> solutions.|$|E
