5|$|Femmes au perroquet ("Women with parrot"; 1952) is {{a bronze}} relief {{situated}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> restaurant building. Created by the Cubist artist Fernand Léger, this work features {{a group of}} women with a parakeet.|$|E
5|$|A {{tapestry}} copy of Picasso's Guernica {{depicting a}} massacre of innocent {{women and children}} during the Spanish civil war is displayed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Nations building in New York City, {{at the entrance to}} the Security Council room, demonstrably as a spur to the conscience of representatives from the nation states. Albert Tucker painted Man's Head to capture the moral disintegration, and lack of conscience, of a man convicted of kicking a dog to death.|$|E
5|$|In about 1797 a {{schoolmaster}} {{living in}} the village cultivated the Williams pear. The schoolmaster (either Mr Wheeler or his successor, John Stair) was the original cultivator, but the pear (a cultivar of the European Pear) was named after Richard Williams of Turnham Green, who grew several grafts of the original tree. On 5 December 1956, a plaque commemorating the tree was unveiled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> village school.|$|E
25|$|In {{at least}} two instances, the images of {{deceased}} Anglican clergymen allegedly appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> their church. In 1902, {{the image of a}} Dean Vaughan allegedly appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> Llandaff cathedral, while the image of Dean Henry Liddell allegedly appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> Christ Church, Oxford in 1923.|$|R

5|$|A notable feature <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{front porch}} {{on the ground}} floor is a foot print on a stone slab. It is said that this foot print belonged to a {{resident}} of the monastery, who was a water carrier, known as Chitenpa. He served in the monastery {{for a long time and}} on one fine day he announced that he had completed his service to the monastery and then stamped his left foot on the stone slab which created a dented formation of his step. This step is venerated as a miracle in view of a belief among the people of the region that such an imprint on a stone slab could only be created by a divine person who was a true devotee of the monastery.|$|E
5|$|Other {{prominent}} artworks on {{the grounds}} include a Marc Chagall stained glass window memorializing the death of Dag Hammarskjöld, the Japanese Peace Bell which is rung on the vernal equinox {{and the opening of}} each General Assembly session, a Chinese ivory carving made in 1974 (before the ivory trade was largely banned in 1989), and a Venetian mosaic depicting Norman Rockwell's painting The Golden Rule. A full-size tapestry copy of Pablo Picasso's Guernica, by , <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United Nations building {{at the entrance to the}} Security Council room. In 1952, two Léger murals were installed in the General Assembly Hall. The works are meant to merely be decorative with no symbolism. One is said to resemble cartoon character Bugs Bunny and U.S. President Harry S. Truman dubbed the other work Scrambled Eggs.|$|E
5|$|The Vicars' Hall was {{completed}} in 1348 and included a communal dining room, administrative offices and treasury of the Vicars Choral. The houses {{on either side of}} the close were built in the 14th and early 15th centuries. Since then alterations have been made including a unified roof, front gardens and raised chimneys. The final part of the construction of the close was during the 1420s when the Vicars' Chapel and Library was constructed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Liberty of St Andrew. The south face includes shields commemorating the bishops of the time. The interior is decorated with 19th century gesso work by Heywood Sumner and the building now used by Wells Cathedral School.|$|E

5|$|The circle symbolizes {{unity and}} {{diversity}} in nature, and many Islamic patterns are drawn {{starting with a}} circle. For example, the decoration of the 15th-century mosque in Yazd, Iran {{is based on a}} circle, divided into six by six circles drawn around it, all touching at its centre and each touching its two neighbours' centres to form a regular hexagon. On this basis is constructed a six-pointed star surrounded by six smaller irregular hexagons to form a tessellating star pattern. This forms the basic design which is outlined in white <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mosque. That design, however, is overlaid with an intersecting tracery in blue around tiles of other colours, forming an elaborate pattern that partially conceals the original and underlying design. A similar design forms the logo of the Mohammed Ali Research Center.|$|E
5|$|The monuments {{include those}} to George Ogden {{who died in}} 1781, by Hayward, to Anne Matthews who died in 1793, by Thomas Banks, to John Philips Buchanan who died at Waterloo in 1815, to the first Duke of Westminster, {{designed}} by C.J.Blomfield, and two memorial plaques {{to members of the}} Egerton family. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southwest crossing pier are monuments which include a cenotaph to the casualties in HMSChester in the Battle of Jutland in 1916 who included the 16-year-old John Cornwell VC. The west wall of the south transept has many memorials, including cenotaphs to the Cheshire Regiment, the Royal Air Force and the Free Czech Forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the college were built using rubble from Oxfordshire dressed with local stone. The {{remaining}} parts of the 17th-century walls are dressed with Headington stone, which was a common building material in Oxford at that time: the geologist W. J. Arkell wrote that it was used for every building in Oxford constructed during this century for which records exist. Areas of Headington stone {{can be seen in}} the first quadrangle <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall. It was only discovered towards the end of the 18th century that it did not weather well: the surface of the stone develops a hard crust, which blisters, bursts and comes off. Much of it has subsequently been replaced with other materials as a result.|$|E

5|$|When {{the railway}} was privatised in 1997, local {{services}} were franchised to Wales & West, which was succeeded by Wessex Trains, {{an arm of}} National Express, in 2001. The station was brightened in 1999 when a mural illustrating local life was painted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> western platform by Bill Guilding. Services along the Severn Beach Line were increased to 10 per day in each direction by 2005, with Bristol City Council providing a subsidy to Wessex Trains. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, rebranded in 2015 as Great Western Railway. A minimum service requirement was written into the franchise agreement, ensuring an hourly service along the Severn Beach Line. Passenger traffic increased significantly, and in 2010, Sunday services to Severn Beach were restored.|$|E
5|$|During the 16th century, Josquin {{gradually}} {{acquired the}} {{reputation as the}} greatest composer of the age, his mastery of technique and expression universally imitated and admired. Writers as diverse as Baldassare Castiglione and Martin Luther wrote about his reputation and fame; theorists such as Heinrich Glarean and Gioseffo Zarlino held his style as that best representing perfection. He was so admired that many anonymous compositions were attributed to him by copyists, probably to increase their sales. More than 370 works are attributed to him; {{it was only after}} the advent of modern analytical scholarship that some of these attributions were challenged, and revealed as mistaken, on the basis of stylistic features and manuscript evidence. Yet in spite of Josquin's colossal reputation, which endured until the beginning of the Baroque era and was revived in the 20th century, his biography is shadowy, and virtually nothing is known about his personality. The only surviving work which may be in his own hand is a graffito <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sistine Chapel, and only one contemporary mention of his character is known, in a letter to Duke Ercole I of Ferrara. The lives of dozens of less revered Renaissance composers are better documented than that of Josquin.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Chris has a pimple on {{his face}} which he names “Doug.” Lois worries about Chris, as Doug tells Chris to make some mischief. He goes to the Swansons' house and sets a bag of feces on fire on their porch, and writes “That’s enough, John Mayer” in spraypaint <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quahog Mini-Mart. Lois sees Chris sneaking back into his room {{and is going to}} punish him but Chris tells her that Doug said he does not have to listen to her. This outrages Lois, {{deciding}} to go to Goldman's Pharmacy the next day and get some astringent to get rid of Doug. However, the next day, as Peter and Lois head to Goldman’s, they realize there has been a break-in, and someone has destroyed Mort’s entire stock of acne medication. That night, when Brooke comes over for dinner to meet Brian’s family, Doug tells Chris to lift up Brooke’s shirt, while Stewie asks how long Brooke has been a hooker. He does this, shocking and offending the family. Joe comes in, saying he has proof that it was Chris who vandalized, broke into Goldman’s Pharmacy and stole Mort's acne medication. Chris decides he no longer wants to listen to Doug after he made his mom cry, but Doug says he could make Chris punch himself, or even worse, shoot him in the brain. Chris finally winds up at the dermatology clinic, and a struggle ensues as Doug tries to shoot him in the brain, but Chris manages to overpower him and use cortisone on Doug, finally taking him out.|$|E

5|$|The {{entry to}} the vestry {{is located at the}} end of the right side aisle next to the choir; {{at the end of the}} left side aisle is the Chapel for Mercy of God. The {{tabernacle}} is situated on the chapel's altar. The church's main altar is faced with a dark green marble, and houses relics of Saints Andrew, Zenon of Verona, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Cosmas, Damian and Anastasia, as well as the Virgin Mary's scarf and a donation from the Diocese of Verona. The ambo—a projection coming out from the soleas—is on the right side of the altar, and is faced with the same marble. Behind the altar, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> apse, there is a nine-metre high stone crucifix with a three-metre high figure of Christ. Plaster figures depicting the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist by architect Svyatoslav Sakhlebin are located on the left and the right sides (respectively) of the corbels. On the opposite side of the altar and above the cathedral's vestibule is the organ loft, which had originally room for 50choristers; a large part of it is now occupied by the organ.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the temple}} is a Shaiva shrine, it {{contains}} {{the images of}} numerous Shakta deities as Parsvadevatas sculpted on its walls. The temple is the first among Bhubaneswar temples to contain Saptamatrika images, a group of seven goddesses. These images are located in between representations of Ganesha and Virabhadra. Except for Ganesha, all other images are depicted with their respective vahanas (vehicles). An eight-armed dancing Ardhanarishvara, an image of Siva-Parvati and the images of Ganga and Yamuna are also found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> temple. There are also images of Vishnu, Indra, Surya and Yama in the rectangular niches {{around the base of}} the porch. A sculpture of Kartikeya riding on his peacock vehicle is present on the southern wall. Other noteworthy carvings are those of Shiva subduing the demon-king Ravana, who is seen trying to uproot Mount Kailasa, the abode of Shiva. Shiva is sculpted as Nataraja in various tandavas (dance poses) in the temple. As with other Orissa temples, the interiors are not sculpted but left plain. Other carvings on the temple depict a variety of fruits, flowers, birds and animals in scenes and parts of designs. A floral motif trailing from the tail of a bird is common between this temple and the ones in Vaital Deula, while a motif of vase and flowers is common between it and the ones in Mukteshvara Temple.|$|E
