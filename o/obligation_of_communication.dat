40|$|The {{corporate}} identity for the International Award Association (IAA) was commissioned in 2001 by Claire Dakin, Head of Communications within the organisation. It was implemented incrementally across {{a range of}} print and web based matter over the following two years. IAA began in 1988 and now acts as a forae for exchange between different member countries with regard to programmes that foreground ‘skill, service, physical recreation, adventure journeys/expeditions similar to and including the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award. Programme which is run in almost 100 countries. The initial undertaking was to expedite a rationalised range of template material for dissemination to affiliated member countries. The importance of avoiding a specifically ‘youth’ oriented graphic identity was clear, as the material was to reach a very wide target audience in different countries ranging from field workers to corporate sponsors. A further undertaking was the design of all material issued from the IAA executive office in London and this needed to be of a piece with the template material. The largest aspect of the research was to identify precisely how the organisation worked and the various lines and <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> and to create designs that met all of the message-centred requirements. Use of logos, typographic hierarchies, grids, formats and colour palettes have been carefully managed for maximum effectiveness particularly with regard to clarity and consistency. One of the challenges encountered was the need to use relatively low quality images as supplied ‘from the field’ by Award operators and candidates. However these have been used to optimum effect by means of judicious cropping and layout throughout. The design logo and templates are still in use today...|$|R
40|$|The Act A 4 {{refers to}} Articles 4 and 5 of Directive 91 / 676 / EEC {{concerning}} {{the protection of}} waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources. The A 4 Act applies to farms that have land within a Nitrate Vulnerable Zone (NVZ); it also applies to farms, with or without herds, that participate in measure 214 of the Rural Development Plans. The monitoring was performed in two experimental farms belonging to CREA-FLC. Both monitoring sites are located in  vulnerable areas designated by the Lombardy Region. In the monitoring period MO. NA. CO., the regional standard of reference were the Decrees of the Regional Government DGR 5868 / 2007 and DGR 2208 / 2011. The average cost attributable to administrative requirements was about € 600 / year / company and was mainly due to a professional agronomist who prepared the Agronomic Utilization Plan (PUA), assisted the farm in preparing its communication, provided advice and informed farm managers on regulatory updates. An informal, not systematic survey made possible to detect that the cost to fulfil the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> can be very variable depending on the farm’s characteristics (size, production, size of the herd) {{and the type of}} consultant assisting the breeder (freelancer, association, cooperative). For example, in some cases the cost is based on the area of the farm, in others on the number of animals in the herd; and in other situations, the associations and freelance agronomist apply a flat rate for the compilation of the PUAs which is unaffected by farm characteristics and ranging from a minimum of € 100 / year / company practiced by some farmers’ association to a maximum of € 800 / year / company required by some freelance agronomist. At Baroncina farm the storage capacity of the slurry, during the monitoring period, was not compliant with the law because the volumes produced could not be stocked for 120 days as required by the standard. New storage facilities have been designed and built; the overall cost of implementation of new tanks was about € 50 / m 3. </p...|$|R
40|$|As a {{response}} to Le Fils, a film directed by the Dardenne brothers (), we explore the idea of speaking as an invitation and juxtapose it against ideas of speaking as a transactional, calculative, calibrated, activity. Speaking tends {{to be understood as}} a relatively straightforward matter: as a means <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> structured by such values as the reciprocal balancing <b>of</b> rights and <b>obligations,</b> <b>of</b> clear <b>communication</b> <b>of</b> information, of the gaining of insight into what is happening. Speaking, then, is a means by which we explain, prove or pass judgement on something. Understood this way, it is easily associated with ideas of empowerment or of the mediation of information: one directs or commits oneself to a (shared) orientationfor example to what Jurgen Habermas refers to as communicative reason. It presupposes a particular attitude of the subject; speaking that addresses the listener and the speaker herself in the name of an orientation or particular expertise to which access is claimed. In this article, by contrast, we would like to explore a different avenue of thought whereby speaking appears rather as an abandoning or exposing of oneself. It is less an activity than a passivity or passion, through which one becomes present in the present, which is at once also a kind of invitation. In exploring this form of speaking, we take up some ideas of Martin Buber. Our discussion relates speaking to being inspiring and being inspired, revealing in the process the way that to be inspiring {{is at the same time}} to be inspired. Speaking as invitation, we conclude, is what education is about...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I discuss {{critically}} Mathias Risse's paper “Responsibility and Global Justice. ” First, I argue that for Risse's pluralist {{account of the}} grounds of justice to hold together, there is need to presuppose a monist standpoint which ultimately contributes to grounding principles of justice. Second, I point out that Risse's understanding <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> accountability and justification is rather narrow in that it functions as an addendum to <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Conversely, I will suggest that the <b>obligation</b> <b>of</b> accountability plays a deeper role: The conditions that ground it feature {{at the same time}} among the grounds <b>of</b> <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice. Accordingly, the kind of relation that gives rise to a duty among agents to account for their actions must be in place when <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice obtain. Following on from these remarks I will adumbrate an alternative account of the relation which grounds (enforceable) <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice...|$|R
40|$|Notions of {{cosmopolitan}} {{and environmental}} citizenship {{have emerged in}} response to concerns about environmental sustainability and global inequality. But {{even if there are}} <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> egalitarian justice that extend across state boundaries, or <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice to use resources in a sustainable way that are owed to those beyond our borders, it is far from clear that these are best conceptualised as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global or environmental citizenship. Through identifying a core concept of citizenship, I suggest that citizenship obligations are, by their nature, owed (at least in part) in virtue of other aspects of one's common citizenship, and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice, even when they arise as a result of interconnectedness or past interactions, are not best conceived as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> citizenship in the absence of some other bond that unites the parties. Without ruling out the possibility of beneficial conceptual change, I argue that Andrew Dobson's model of ecological citizenship is flawed because there is no good reason to regard the <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> environmental justice which it identifies as <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> ecological citizenship, and that other models of cosmopolitan or global citizenship face a similar objectio...|$|R

Cases discussing the requirement that municipalities provide alternative avenues <b>of</b> <b>communication</b> for adult businesses have raised many questions as to how rural and residential municipalities may satisfy this obligation. This Note identifies three solutions that would help frame this inquiry. First, state or county legislative bodies should adopt countywide or statewide location restricdons on adult businesses.

Third, courts should undertake a supply-and-demand analysis when assessing what constitutes sufficient alternative avenues <b>of</b> <b>communication,</b> Adoption <b>of</b> these solutions would help to ensure that the First Amendment <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> rural and residential municipalities reflect the unique burdens of such municipalities while maintaining appropriate protection for free speech...|$|R

40|$|In Just Health, Norman Daniels makes {{a strong}} {{argument}} for <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> mutual assistance {{to fulfill the}} right to health {{at the national level}} and challenges readers to develop arguments supporting <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> mutual assistance at the global level. In this paper, we argue that there is global responsibility for global health and that there are <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> justice (beyond charity) to help fulfill (not merely respect or even protect) the right to health in other countries; these we call <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice. We show how international human rights law affirms <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice - beyond national obligations and beyond <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> charity - and assert that the human rights approach provides guidance on delineating the relationship between national and global responsibility for fulfilling the core obligations that arise from socioeconomic human rights and addressing global health inequities. We further argue that new ways of providing international assistance, originating from the global HIV/AIDS response, demonstrate the feasibility of improving health outcomes through exogenous efforts and that <b>obligations</b> <b>of</b> global health justice thus carry much weight: the weight of lives not saved. The global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic has led to {{the emergence of a new}} international health assistance paradigm, and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is, we suggest, an embryonic form of this new paradigm. We conclude that agreements on several common parameters delineating global and national responsibility for global health can advance the movement towards a global institution for the distribution of health-related goods...|$|R
