500|$|Upon being dismissed, Borglum wrecked his {{models for}} the monument; the Association sought to have him jailed for {{destruction}} of property. [...] Borglum was addressing the ladies of the Atlanta chapter of the UDC when his assistant, Jesse Tucker, burst in and hurried him <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> a minimum of explanation, only moments before a sheriff's deputy arrived to serve the warrant. He left the state, but was arrested in Greensboro, North Carolina, though quickly allowed bail, and the Association abandoned extradition proceedings. Freed, the sculptor soon took up a project in South Dakota, Mount Rushmore. The publicity surrounding these events hurt the Association's fundraising, as did allegations that the Association had misused {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars put aside for the project.|$|E
6000|$|... "Keep away, an' keep movin'," [...] one of {{the policemen}} growled fiercely. [...] "An' do what we say, or get your head cracked. Out you go, now. <b>Out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> you. Better tell that coon to stick right {{alongside}} you." ...|$|E
60|$|A miserable hut {{gave him}} an {{opportunity}} to execute his purpose. He found <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> no small difficulty, and for some time knocked without producing any other answer than a duet between a female and a cur-dog, the latter yelping {{as if he would}} have barked his heart out, the other screaming in chorus. By degrees the human tones predominated; but the angry bark of the cur being at the instant changed into a howl, it is probable something more than fair strength of lungs had contributed to the ascendency.|$|E
60|$|With his {{accustomed}} chivalrous manner, Lawyer Gooch ushered his soulful client {{into the}} remaining unoccupied room, and came <b>out,</b> closing <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> circumspection.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, indeed," [...] said Marian. [...] "But O! here {{he comes}} <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> his cigar. He is getting in! There he goes! O, Lionel!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Came the {{day when}} [...] "Overdue" [...] was finished. The agent of the type-writer firm had come for the machine, and {{he sat on the}} bed while Martin, on the one chair, typed the last pages of the final chapter. [...] "Finis," [...] he wrote, in capitals, at the end, and to him it was indeed finis. He watched the type-writer carried <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> a feeling of relief, then went over and lay down on the bed. He was faint from hunger. Food had not passed his lips in thirty-six hours, but he did not think about it. He lay on his back, with closed eyes, and did not think at all, while the daze or stupor slowly welled up, saturating his consciousness. Half in delirium, he began muttering aloud the lines of an {{anonymous}} poem Brissenden had been fond of quoting to him. Maria, listening anxiously outside his door, was perturbed by his monotonous utterance. The words in themselves were not significant to her, but {{the fact that he was}} saying them was. [...] "I have done," [...] was the burden of the poem.|$|E
60|$|Neale crawled {{along the}} {{inclosure}} to the opening. On {{that side of}} the buildings there was dark shadow. But it was lifting. He ran along the wall, and he heard the whistle of bullets. Back of the cabin the Indians appeared to have gathered in force. Neale got to the corner and peered round. The blazing tents lighted up this end. He saw the graders break and run, some on his side of the cabin. He clambered in. A door of this room was open, and through it Neale saw the roof of the engineers' quarters blazing. He heard the women screaming. Evidently they too were running out to the in-closure. Neale hurried into the room where he had left Allie. He called. There was no answer, but a growing roar outside apparently drowned his voice. It was dark in this room. He felt along the wall, the fireplace, the corner. Allie was not there. The room was empty. His hands groping low along the floor came in contact with the bag he had left in Allie's charge. It contained the papers he had taken the precaution to save. Probably in her flight to escape from the burning cabin she had dropped it. But that was not like Allie: she would have clung to the bag while strength and sense were hers. Perhaps she had not gotten out of the cabin. Neale searched again, growing more and more aware of the strife outside. He heard the crackling of wood over his head. Evidently the cabin was burning like tinder. There were men in the back room, fighting, yelling, crowding. Neale could see only dim, burly forms and the flashes of guns. Smoke floated thickly there. Some one, on the inside or outside, was beating <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> an axe.|$|E
5000|$|Whittinghill made {{television}} appearances as well, {{including a}} number of appearances on Dragnet in the 1960s, once as himself. A favorite of producer Jack Webb, he also appeared in a 1971 episode of Webb's Adam-12. He always signed off from his morning show with [...] "I'm walkin' <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>with</b> you on my mind..." [...] from the Nat King Cole record, [...] "Walkin'". A sly punster and a master of double-entendre, longtime listeners knew that Montana-born Whittinghill was really [...] "walkin' <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> ewe on his mind".|$|E
6000|$|... "That's a thing never {{happened}} to me before," [...] he observed, [...] "to go <b>out</b> o' <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> my spectacles on. I clean forgot to take 'em off." ...|$|R

60|$|After the {{exchange}} of a few more compliments, they bade the company good-night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as they did so, and lounging <b>out</b> to <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> <b>with</b> her hands full, to see the party start.|$|R
50|$|Linlithgow Rose sacked boss David Baikie {{after they}} lost to Bonnyrigg. Baikie, who only 18 months ago led the club to Scottish Cup glory, was forced <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> assistants Graeme Irons and Derek Carr.|$|E
50|$|More-advanced {{enrollment}} managers {{also tend}} to focus as much on retaining admitted students as on deciding whom to recruit and accept. They smooth out administrative hassles, guarantee at-risk students the advising and academic help they need, and ensure that the {{different parts of the}} university's bureaucracy work together to get students <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> a degree.|$|E
5000|$|Karl goes {{alone to}} the Pahmeyer farmhouse, calling Mr. Pahmeyer {{to come out}} and end the feud. Mr. Pahmeyer calls back that he is sorry about killing Emile, that he never {{intended}} to do that. Karl calls back that he knows that, and again offers to end the feud. But despite the cries of his wife, Mr. Pahmeyer calls, [...] "I don't think I can do it!" [...] and charges <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> his gun. Howling, [...] "NOOOOO!", Karl is forced to kill him.|$|E
60|$|This {{time it was}} Mrs Frog's turn to make no reply! in a {{few minutes}} she seemed to become desperate, for, rising hastily, she went <b>out,</b> shut <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> a bang, locked it, and set <b>out</b> on <b>the</b> {{familiar}} journey to the gin-shop.|$|R

5000|$|... 8” - She did all right. “But {{there was}} one didn’t.” One of Joe’s other loves, a young, slim, pale girl did not fare so well. He {{said the same thing}} to her that the best was yet to come, just as he did with Voice, as he bundled the girl <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> no {{intention}} of furthering the relationship now he’d got what he wanted from her. In fact his aeroplane ticket was in his pocket ready for him to make good his escape. The timeline is unclear but the likelihood is that his relationship with Voice came first.|$|E
5000|$|Sam's brown tabby cat. He was a {{gift from}} Jake in [...] "The Challenger," [...] and named for the {{adolescent}} cougar that attacked Sam while riding Strawberry earlier in the book. He is most often seen racing Sam down the stairs in her ranch home or snuggling deep into her covers on cold nights. Everyone on the ranch, including Wyatt and the hands have to keep constant watch that he doesn't slip <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> them. The cat enjoys the outdoors, but Sam worries a coyote could kill him.Cougar develops a friendship with the draft horse mustang Tinkerbell(Tinker)and Cougar would often sleep on Tinker's back in the barn.|$|E

60|$|While I {{was still}} in this {{delightful}} dream, we came suddenly {{in front of a}} large inn and met Squire Trelawney, all dressed out like a sea-officer, in stout blue cloth, coming <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> {{a smile on his face}} and a capital imitation of a sailor's walk.|$|R

50|$|Dave runs <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> {{the money}} and {{purchases}} the pistol from Joe. On his way home he stops in the fields {{to play with the}} gun, only he is unsure of how to use it so he just points and pretends to be shooting imaginary objects. When he arrives at his house he breaks his promise and does not surrender the gun, instead he hides it under his pillow, and when his mother comes to retrieve it he claims to have hidden it outside. Dave wakes and with the gun in his hands thinks to himself that he now has the power to “kill anybody, black or white.” He ties the pistol to his leg with a piece of flannel and leaves the house early so he can go unnoticed and not have to give up the gun.|$|E
50|$|This act opens {{during the}} middle of the next night, the night in which they plan on abandoning their {{children}} and running away. Nic arrives at the apartment early feeling overwhelmed and needing to begin the plan immediately. Brian agrees and goes to wake Eileen and gather her things. While he does so, Nic is left alone. Suddenly, Blanka wakes from where she is sleeping under a blanket on the living room couch. She speaks with Nic and tries to understand why Nic feels the need to abandon her child and Blanka works desperately to convince Nic to stay. Nic, in response, tells her of one of the 'bad days' Dominic had recently and how overwhelmed she has become caring for him, reasoning that because of this her only option is to leave. The scene ends with Brian carrying a sleeping Emily <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> Nic and Eileen close on his heels.|$|E

[...] "How did you know it was Catch-22? Who the hell told you it was Catch-22?""The soldiers with the hard white hats and clubs. The girls were crying. 'Did we do anything wrong?' they said.

60|$|Though so young, she infused {{in these}} parting words {{a love that}} was far more like a mother's than a sister's, and before which the boy was quite bowed down.

5000|$|Lionheart {{received}} [...] "mixed" [...] reviews {{according to}} the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot's Greg Kasavin noted that although Lionheart seems to promote diverse character creation, the significant focus on monster-infested areas [...] "all but forces you to play {{as some sort of}} combat-oriented character." [...] The game was also criticised for its attempts at promoting [...] "Diablo-style," [...] hack-and-slash gameplay after a more dialogue-driven approach in the earlier stages of the game. IGN's Barry Brenesal wrote, [...] "the problem of deciding what kind of game it really wants to be, RPG or Diablo clone, is probably the most serious problem it's got." [...] He continued that Lionheart [...] "feels like a good game got lost somewhere en route, and ended up being pushed <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> some basic features missing." [...] RPGamer's Steven Bellotti assessed that the game [...] "starts out so promising," [...] but [...] "once you get out of Barcelona and into the wider world, it falls flat on its face." ...|$|E

We {{come back to the}} Musician, who opens a telephone directory and chooses, at random, a name: who but Cookie at 00 1/2 Cornbread Avenue? The musician calls Cookie, and, over the phone, magically entices her (a tough customer, he admits!) to come to him: Cookie stalks out the door, but Bozo the Dog remains. Bozo sniffs about for a trail and then rushes off to find Buddy. Our Hero sits at home, in a chair, admiring a picture of Cookie. Bozo knocks over Buddy's chair, breaks the frame of the photograph and yelps wildly at Buddy. Buddy at first, can not decipher what Cookie's pet wants him to know, until Bozo picks up the picture of Cookie. Buddy then dons an outfit resembling that of Sherlock Holmes and rushes <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> Bozo.|$|E
5000|$|Sales of {{the series}} had slumped for several years, but took a sharp upturn after Rob Liefeld took over the penciling and co-plotting chores {{at the end of}} 1989. A new mentor for the group, the mysterious {{mercenary}} Cable, was introduced, further helping sales. Over the next year, several longtime team members were written out or killed off. However, the relationship between Liefeld and Simonson was fraught with tension, and Simonson claims that Harras dealt with the situation by rewriting her plots and dialogue so that the characterizations did not make sense: [...] "Although I wasn't being fired, I think I was being shoved <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>with</b> both hands by Bob Harras. Bob was only doing what he had to do, I expect, which was make Rob Liefeld happy." [...] Simonson eventually gave in, leaving after issue #97. When Liefeld and Fabian Nicieza, who wrote dialogue based on Liefeld's plots, took over as writers of the final three issues {{of the series}}, they included several harder-edged characters: ...|$|E
