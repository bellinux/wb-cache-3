Though after a win over the French and one over the Springboks, the Wallabies fell {{to the bottom of the}} 2005 Tri Nations Series table, losing all of their games. With his start in the final match of the 2005 Tri Nations at Eden Park in Auckland against the All Blacks, Gregan equalled England's Jason Leonard as the most-capped player for a national team in Test rugby, with 114 (Leonard also has five Lions caps).

If I can, I want to be a one-club player too. Playing footy is not just about 80 minutes <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> every week.

He responded, [...] "For God's sake, General, {{this is the last}} great battle, and I must lead my brigade." [...] Scott yielded, and Pierce entered the fight tied to his saddle, but the pain in his leg became so great that he passed <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> The Americans won the battle and Pierce helped {{negotiate}} an armistice. He then returned to command and led his brigade {{throughout the rest of the}} campaign, eventually taking part in the capture of Mexico City in mid-September, although his brigade was held in reserve for much of the battle. He spent much of Mexico City fight in the sick tent, plagued with acute diarrhea. Pierce remained in command of his brigade during the three-month occupation of the city, while frustrated with the stalling of peace negotiations, and tried to distance himself from the constant conflict between Scott and the other generals.|$|E

500|$|On 29 June 1958, Pelé {{became the}} {{youngest}} player {{to play in a}} World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days. He scored two goals in that final as Brazil beat Sweden 5–2 in Stockholm, the capital. His first goal where he flicked the ball over a defender before volleying into the corner of the net, was selected {{as one of the best}} goals in the history of the World Cup. Following Pelé's second goal, Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment; [...] "When Pelé scored the fifth goal in that Final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding". When the match ended, Pelé passed <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> and was revived by Garrincha.

He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker Just Fontaine, and was named best young player of the tournament.|$|E
500|$|Boycott {{was again}} refused the {{captaincy}} {{for the next}} Test series against India over the winter of 1981–82. Angered by this decision, he stated that [...] "even the Yorkshire Ripper got a fair trial in the dock but I've not been given a single chance." [...] He later battled Keith Fletcher over his slow scoring rate, playing Fletcher's comments to him during a press conference using a tape recorder. The series against India was to be his last. In his final ODI match during England's tour he scored 6 from 12 deliveries. During the following Test series he passed Sobers' career run record, hitting 60 in the first Test, 36 and 50 in the second to take him 81 runs short, and in the third Test he overtook the record with a flick off his pads for four. He became the leading Test run-scorer. In his last Test match, the fourth of the tour, taking place in January 1982, he scored 18 and six. During the tour, Boycott claimed he was too ill to field in a Test Match, but it was later discovered that he was playing golf while his teammates were still <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b>|$|E
500|$|Cleveland Indians {{owner and}} team {{president}} Bill Veeck proposed integrating baseball in 1942, {{which had been}} informally segregated {{since the turn of}} the century, but this was rejected by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Veeck had begun the process of finding a young, talented player from the Negro leagues, and told a reporter in Cleveland that he would integrate the Indians' roster if he could find a black player with the necessary talent level who could withstand the taunts and pressure of being the first black athlete in the AL. The reporter suggested Doby, of whom Veeck had seen at the Great Lakes Naval Training School. Doby's name was also mentioned when Veeck talked with reporters who covered the Negro leagues. Indians scout Bill Killefer rated Doby favorably and perhaps just as important for Veeck, reported Doby's off-field behavior was not a concern. The Dodgers rated Doby their top young Negro league prospect. But unlike the Brooklyn Dodgers' Branch Rickey, who signed Robinson one full season before bringing him to the National League, Veeck used a different strategy, letting Doby remain with the Eagles instead of bringing him through the Indians' farm system. He told the Pittsburgh Courier, [...] "One afternoon when the team trots <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> a Negro player will be out there with it." ...|$|E

Michigan used their entire {{possession}} to try to center the ball for Gibbons, and then they attempted a field goal, but it was blocked, to send the game into a second overtime. [...] Michigan {{got the ball}} to start the second overtime, achieved one first down, and Gibbons redeemed himself, kicking a 25-yard field goal. Ficken responded, tacking on a 36-yard field goal {{to tie the game}} at 37, headed into a third overtime. Penn State got the ball to start the third overtime, but on their first play, an end-around to Robinson that he fumbled and was recovered by Clark to set up Michigan with a chance to win the game with any score. Gibbons had an opportunity to win the game, but missed wide, and sent the game into a fourth overtime. Michigan got the ball to start the fourth overtime, and stalled, leaving Gibbons to attempt a 40-yard field goal, which he made to put the Wolverines on top 40–37. Penn State then needed a field goal to tie, or a touchdown to win. Faced with a fourth down and one, O'Brien sent his team <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> to go for it, and they converted via a two-yard run by Belton. Three plays later, Hackenberg threw an incomplete pass intended for Robinson in the end zone, but officials called pass interference on the play, which occurred in the end zone, resulting in the ball being placed at the two yard line. On Penn State's next play, Hackenberg handed the ball off to Belton, who ran it in for a two-yard touchdown, winning the game for Penn State.|$|E
