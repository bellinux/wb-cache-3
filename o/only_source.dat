5|$|Many {{texts from}} the Roman Empire {{refer to the}} mysteries of Isis, but the <b>only</b> <b>source</b> to {{describe}} them {{is a work of}} fiction, the novel Metamorphoses, written in the second century CE by Apuleius.

5|$|The {{abundance}} of deuterium in comet Hale–Bopp {{in the form}} of heavy water was found to be about twice that of Earth's oceans.

5|$|Henry was {{allegedly}} buried in Nousiainen, from where his bones—or at least {{something that was}} thought to be his bones—were transported to Turku in 1300. In addition to traditions, the <b>only</b> <b>source</b> connecting Nousiainen to early bishops is a letter signed by Bishop Thomas in Nousiainen in 1234. Archaeological excavations of pre-Catholic cemeteries in Nousiainen and surrounding parishes show a clear discontinuation of traditions in the early 13th century, but no abrupt changes are apparent in the religious environment among the 12th century finds.|$|E
5|$|In Newton's {{description}} of gravity, the gravitational force {{is caused by}} matter. More precisely, it {{is caused by a}} specific property of material objects: their mass. In Einstein's theory and related theories of gravitation, curvature at every point in spacetime is also caused by whatever matter is present. Here, too, mass is a key property in determining the gravitational influence of matter. But in a relativistic theory of gravity, mass cannot be the <b>only</b> <b>source</b> of gravity. Relativity links mass with energy, and energy with momentum.|$|E

5|$|Neon gives a {{distinct}} reddish-orange glow {{when used in}} low-voltage neon glow lamps, high-voltage discharge tubes and neon advertising signs. The red emission line from neon also causes the well known red light of helium–neon lasers. Neon is used in some plasma tube and refrigerant applications but has few other commercial uses. It is commercially extracted by the fractional distillation of liquid air. Since air is the <b>only</b> <b>source,</b> it is considerably more expensive than helium.|$|E
5|$|On 12 June 1917, the {{day after}} his accession, Alexander {{revealed}} his liaison with Aspasia Manos to his father and asked for his permission to marry her. Constantine was reluctant to let his son marry a non-royal, and demanded that Alexander wait {{until the end of the}} war before considering the engagement, to which Alexander agreed. In the intervening months, Alexander increasingly resented his separation from his family. His regular letters to his parents were intercepted by the government and confiscated. Alexander's <b>only</b> <b>source</b> of comfort was Aspasia, and he took the decision to marry her despite his father's request.|$|E

5|$|Originally, the <b>only</b> <b>source</b> for nickel was {{the rare}} Kupfernickel. Beginning in 1824, nickel was {{obtained}} as {{a byproduct of}} cobalt blue production. The first large-scale smelting of nickel began in Norway in 1848 from nickel-rich pyrrhotite. The introduction of nickel in steel production in 1889 increased the demand for nickel, and the nickel deposits of New Caledonia, discovered in 1865, provided most of the world's supply between 1875 and 1915. The discovery of the large deposits in the Sudbury Basin, Canada in 1883, in Norilsk-Talnakh, Russia in 1920, and in the Merensky Reef, South Africa in 1924, made large-scale production of nickel possible.|$|E
5|$|The Omnem {{constitution}} at {{the beginning}} of the Digest is the <b>only</b> <b>source</b> of information about the existing study system in the 5th century until the Justinian reforms of 533. The old program was a four-year course to be completed before the age of 25. The courses were based on the works of Gaius, Ulpian, Papinian and Paulus. Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' Responsa; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, Dupondii; second, Edictales; third, Papinianistae; fourth, Lytae.|$|E

It was discovered on 13 October 1935 by Egyptologist George A. Reisner during a joint Harvard University-Boston Museum of Fine Arts expedition, and removed from the site four days later.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Nitrogen fixing Paenibacillus strains were {{isolated}} from different soils on N-free media by heat shock and grown on N-free media in anaerobic condition. The cellulase positive Paenibacillus were selected {{by reduction of}} congored color on CMC medium. Three of these isolates with CMCase activities were identified as Paenibacillus strain E, H and SH. This nitrogen fixing strains with cellulase activities Paenibacillus, grow well on N-free media with sucrose or mannitol as the <b>only</b> <b>sources</b> of carbon and 1 produced 3. 16 and 1. 3 mM ammonium respectively. Paenibacillus strain E produced 4 u ml CMCase when it was grown on CMC as the <b>only</b> <b>sources</b> of carbon. This phenomena might help to plant microbe-interaction for nitrogen fixation...|$|R
5|$|The {{private sector}} {{was not the}} <b>only</b> <b>source</b> of racism: under President Wilson, the plight of African Americans in {{government}} jobs suffered. Many federal agencies adopted whites-only employment practices, the Army excluded blacks from officer ranks, and the immigration service prohibited the immigration of persons of African ancestry. Du Bois wrote an editorial in 1914 deploring the dismissal of blacks from federal posts, and he supported William Monroe Trotter when Trotter brusquely confronted Wilson about Wilson's failure to fulfill his campaign promise of justice for blacks.|$|E
