40|$|The most {{important}} component needed in realizing a sustainable land {{development is a}} parcel-based data which acquired from the cadastral records. These data define not only size, shape, location, value {{of the real estate}} but also land-related rights, restrictions and responsibilities. While cadastre provides a guarantee and protects landowner’s rights in many countries, it is also used for new land policy aims. Therefore, cadastre plays an important role on states in order to develop and supply new services such as spatial-based information systems in urban areas. Urban Information Systems (UIS) can be considered as an implementation of GIS in urban extent. It is an effective tool for local authorities with respect to manage urban relevant data and well-qualified service offer. Many geospatial data should be examined {{at the same time in}} UIS because of land planning, development and <b>other</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures.</b> However, land parcel-based information is very significant within this entire management task. From land taxation to environmental works in urban areas, cadastral documents are the main references which are always needed for a meaningful decision-making. Because cadastre is a methodically arranged public inventory of data concerning properties within a certain area, up-to-date cadastral data should b...|$|E
40|$|This essay – and {{the thirty}} images {{included}} – reflect themes in Representing Justice: Invention, Controversy, and Rights in City-States and Democratic Courtrooms, {{in which we}} explored the relationship, over centuries, between courts and democracy. We argue that courts {{as we know them}} today are recent inventions. The constitutive elements – open access, independent judges authorized to sit in judgment of the state and to assess the fairness of their own as well as <b>other</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures,</b> equal and dignified treatment of all participants – are outgrowths of social movements that transformed the meaning of legal “personhood,” the idea of justice, and the obligations of government. Yet the new equality puts pressure on the visual displays within courthouses, often marked as such by a statute of the Virtue Justice. As women and men of all colors gained recognition as rights holders, entitled to sue and be sued, to testify, and to judge, a female figure of Justice, became less an abstraction and more a representation of a person. But who should decide how “she” – Justice – is to look? Once, elite groups of rulers and patrons controlled commissions – filling courthouses with portraits of elder statesmen along with the draped (or naked) female figure of Justice. In contrast, during thetwentieth century, conflicts over Justice’s color and shape came to the fore. Protests, detailed below, erupted in the 1930 s about a “mulatto” Justice in a federal courthouse in Aiken, South Carolina. The result was to put the image behind drapes. In contrast, inthe same era, a mural on the Ada County Courthouse in Idaho displayed an “Indian” with hands tied behind his back and about to be strung up by gun-carrying men. Pressures of another kind are undermining the public and didactic practices of adjudication. Democracy has not only changedcourts but also challenged them profoundly. Egalitarianism poses deep problems for polities that have thus far been unwilling to commit the resources that would support all the adjudicatory opportunities promised. As the ranks of rights holders expanded, nations responded not only by creating more judgeships and more courthouses but also by moving some forms of adjudication offsite, to administrative tribunals and to procedures that have come to be known by the acronym ADR – alternative dispute resolution. The resulting fragmentation and privatization of adjudication has profound implications for the democratic character ofcourts. The movement away from public adjudication is a problem for democracies because adjudication has important contributions to make to democracy. By democracy, we speak not of majoritarian political processes but rather of aspirations for lawmaking through egalitarian methods that foster popular input into governing norms and impose robust constraints on both public andprivate power. Furthermore, by courts, we focus on the quotidian activities of ordinary litigation rather than only on the outcomesof the highest judicial bodies. Constitutional scholars debate the legitimacy of judicial review in democracies, while we argue that adjudication itself is a democratic process, which reconfigures power as it obliges disputants and judges to treat each other as equals, to provide information to each other, and to offer public justifications for decisions, based on the interaction of fact andnorm. Courts’ mandate to operate in public endows the audience – the public – with the ability and the authority of critique. Through such participatory parity, public processes both teach about democratic practices of norm development and offer theopportunity for popular input to produce changes in legal rights. The redundancy of various claims of rights enables debate aboutthe underlying legal rules. The particular structural obligations of trial level courts have advantages for producing, redistributing, and curbing power in a fashion that is generative in democracies. Our account is not only a reconstruction of a many-century history of the idea of “courts” and a normative exploration of the utilityof courts for democratic orders. Our aim is also to make plain the fragility and contingency of the twentieth-century project for which the word “court” has become a shorthand. While monumental in ambition and often in physical girth, the durability of courtsas active sites of public exchange before independent jurists ought not be taken for granted. Like other venerable institutions ofthe eighteenth century – the postal service and the press – courts are vulnerable. The continuation of accessible court services for ordinary disputants seeking state assistance is far from assured...|$|E
40|$|Most of the {{emerging}} economic mechanisms for promoting SFM, such as REDD projects, PES schemes and forest certification initiatives, are expected to involve profound changes {{in the role of}} public authorities, their relationships and networking with <b>other</b> actors, <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures,</b> etc. : in short, in governance. In the current debate on new forms of participatory governance, attention is rarely focused on the instruments to assess "good governance". World-wide, evaluation criteria and related indicators have so far been developed mainly for analyzing policies and governance issues at international, regional or national scale. The Forest Governance Diagnostics Tool of the WB and the Governance of Forests Toolkit of the WRI are examples of initiatives to assess good forestry governance at national level. But no well-consolidated system yet exists of indicators for measuring "good governance" also at local scale and project level where policies are implemented in practice. On the basis of three case-studies (one REDD+ project in Tanzania, one PES scheme and one forest certification initiative in Italy), the paper presents and discusses a conceptual framework of key-dimensions and indicators/variables to assess "good governance" in forestry, at the level of projects implementation. The purpose is to identify cheap and reliable secondary data sources and suitable instruments (e. g. the Social Network Analysis) for collecting/analyzing primary data. Seven dimensions are considered relevant to the new governance modes: Sustainable glocal development, Efficiency, Effectiveness, Participation, Transparency, Accountability and Capacity. Key aspects include unclear benefit/cost sharing mechanisms, weak coordination, limited implementation of participatory procedures, etc. Methodological problems are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures,</b> such as multi-criteria {{evaluation}} (MCE), often {{rely upon}} input data derived from remote sensing {{in the form}} of land cover maps. However, these data can often contain inherent errors and misclassifications that can influence the accuracy of the final output associated with spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures.</b> The research presented here explores what influence errors and misclassifications in remote sensing derived land cover data can have on the output from spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures.</b> Four land cover data layers, each covering the same spatial area and easily obtained from scholarly or governmental institutions, are used throughout this research. These comparative land cover data layers are compared with an author-created land cover data layer known as the BASE layer. The BASE layer represents the nearest approximation of the land cover condition in the study region. Overall land cover classification accuracy is assessed for each of the land cover data layers used in this research. In addition to overall land cover classification accuracy, classification accuracy is evaluated along the edge and interior of land cover regions in order to determine if the spatial location of errors and misclassifications, rather than the quantity of errors and misclassifications alone, can {{have an impact on the}} output form spatial decision making procedures. This is followed by an assessment of the influence of errors and misclassifications on site and situational factors, two of the primary components of spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedures.</b> Direct comparisons are made between the BASE layer and the comparative land cover data layers. A series of multi-criteria evaluation procedures using the BASE layer and the four comparative data layers as input concludes this research. The output from the spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure</b> using the BASE layer is directly compared with the same spatial <b>decision-making</b> <b>procedure</b> using each of the comparative land cover data layers as input.

40|$|According to the neo-corporatist {{approach}} to the “problem of compliance,” worker control over union policy is incompatible with centralized wage regulation, because only associations in which national leaders are insulated from their members are capable of delivering rank-and-file acceptance of wage moderation.
