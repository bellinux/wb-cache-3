For example, a medical statement or examination for fitness, pre-dive site assessment and briefing, safety drills, thermal protection, equipment redundancy, alternative air source, buddy checks, buddy or team diving procedures, dive planning, underwater hand signals, and carrying first aid and oxygen administration equipment are all routinely part <b>of</b> <b>technical</b> diving.|$|E

In late 1939, a Spanish mission to Italy received assurances <b>of</b> <b>technical</b> support for the construction of ships of the class in Spanish yards, and a slipway of sufficient size to construct two ships at a time was built at Ferrol. However, Italy's entry into the Second World War in 1940, combined with the limited resources of Spain, led to the cancellation of the project.|$|E
5|$|As the Allied {{offensive}} gained steam, Whitehead's {{main task}} was to shift his aircraft forward, advancing the bomb line incrementally towards Japan. When the P-38 Lightning arrived in the theater in late 1942, Whitehead at last received a fighter that could match the Japanese A6M Zero. To speed up the Allied advance, the Fifth Air Force developed a number <b>of</b> <b>technical</b> and tactical innovations that extended the range of its aircraft, thus increasing the distance of each Allied advance, which was dependent on the range of Whitehead's aircraft.|$|E

This reinforces the master gunnery sergeant's role as a provider <b>of</b> <b>technical</b> military leadership.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influence of}} the colonial experience (1945 - 1997) on the planning <b>of</b> secondary <b>technical</b> education in Hong Kong. Specifically, the origins <b>of</b> secondary <b>technical</b> institutions and their positioning in secondary education are examined. Primary source materials are used as the basis of investigation and analysis, supplemented by secondary sources. The study finds that the origins and form <b>of</b> secondary <b>technical</b> education in Hong Kong mirrored those <b>of</b> secondary <b>technical</b> education in the British tripartite school system (grammar, technical, and modern). The breakdown of the tripartite school system in Britain might have led the colonial government not to adopt the full British model <b>of</b> secondary <b>technical</b> education. Nevertheless, the British tripartite school system had a long-term impact on the development <b>of</b> secondary <b>technical</b> schools in Hong Kong. Following the end of colonial rule, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government initiated education reform, which brought an end to curriculum differentiation by school types (grammar, technical, and prevocational) and replaced it with comprehensive education. © 2011 The Vocational Aspect of Education Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
