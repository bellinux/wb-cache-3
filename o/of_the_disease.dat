5|$|Cognitive {{disturbances}} {{can occur}} {{in the early stages}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> The most common cognitive deficit in PD is executive dysfunction, which can include problems with planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, inhibiting inappropriate actions, initiating appropriate actions, working memory, and control of attention. Other cognitive difficulties include slowed cognitive processing speed, impaired recall and impaired perception and estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial difficulties are also part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines. A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population.|$|E
5|$|In 1817 an English doctor, James Parkinson, {{published}} his essay reporting six cases of paralysis agitans. An Essay on the Shaking Palsy described the characteristic resting tremor, abnormal posture and gait, paralysis and diminished muscle strength, {{and the way}} that the disease progresses over time. Early neurologists who made further additions to the knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> include Trousseau, Gowers, Kinnier Wilson and Erb, and most notably Jean-Martin Charcot, whose studies between 1868 and 1881 were a landmark in the understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> Among other advances, he made the distinction between rigidity, weakness and bradykinesia. He also championed the renaming <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> in honor of James Parkinson.|$|E

5|$|The first likely {{description}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> was in 1841 by Charles Oscar Waters. The {{condition was}} described in further detail in 1872 by George Huntington, after whom it is named. The genetic basis was discovered in 1993 by an international collaborative effort led by the Hereditary Disease Foundation. Research and support organizations began forming in the late 1960s to increase public awareness, to provide support for individuals and their families, and to promote research. Current research directions include determining the exact mechanism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> improving animal models to aid with research, testing of medications to treat symptoms or slow the progression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease,</b> and studying procedures such as stem cell therapy {{with the goal of}} repairing damage caused by the disease.|$|E
30|$|In this survey, most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> renewed <b>diseases</b> were {{distributed}} in the region up to 2  m above the ground.

5|$|A normal {{variation}} in the PRNP gene can modify the course <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease</b> by delaying the age of onset and affecting the type of symptoms that develop.

5|$|Actor Michael J.

5|$|Alterations in the {{autonomic}} {{nervous system}} can lead to orthostatic hypotension (low blood pressure upon standing), oily skin and excessive sweating, urinary incontinence, and altered sexual function. Constipation and impaired stomach emptying (gastric dysmotility) can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health. Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell, disturbed vision, pain, and paresthesia (tingling and numbness). All of these symptoms can occur years before diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E

5|$|Before Dorne fully succumbs to the disease, they do {{tests on}} him {{to figure out a}} cure. They {{determined}} that the only possible way to fight it would be to make a vaccine that uses the original source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> While the origin of the virus is tracked back to being on Roak itself, it is from Asmodeus, the King of the Demon World, who had been killed 300 years prior to the spread <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>disease.</b> Ronyx talks the group into using a Time Gate on the Planey Styx to go back 300 years into the past to track down Asmodeus back when he was still alive. While this works, Ilia trips while approaching the gate. As such, Ilia and Roddick have a delay from when they enter the time gate, and after the trip through time, they find themselves separated from Ronyx and Millie. The two groups work towards locating each other, and Asmodeus, in efforts to heal their family members and stop the war.|$|E
