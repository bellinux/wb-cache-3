50|$|It {{is often}} seen that people choose to marry within their sociological group or {{with someone who is}} close to them in status. Characteristics such as ethnicity, race, religion, and {{socioeconomic}} status play a role in how someone chooses their spouse. Socioeconomic status can be defined as an individual’s income, level of education, and occupation. Research on socioeconomic status of homogamy was developed by stratification researchers who used marriage patterns in conjunction with mobility patterns to describe how open stratification systems are. (Kalmijn, 2). Socioeconomic status can be divided into two studies: ascribed status and achieved status. Ascribed status simply means the <b>occupational</b> <b>class</b> of the father or father in law while achieved status is one’s education and occupation. Ascribed status has become less important while achieved status and education have not lost their importance.|$|E

50|$|Architecturally, Roaring Spring's neighborhoods display {{relatively}} little hierarchy by income or occupation. Admittedly, some areas, like the Hogback {{just south of}} the paper mill, were especially known as mill workers' enclaves, but overall the town lacks the strong homogeneity of worker house types and segmentation by <b>occupational</b> <b>class</b> common to coal company towns. D. M. Bare and his cohorts seemed to have envisioned Roaring Spring as a working community of middle-class homeowners plucked from the ranks of shopkeepers, professionals and skilled workers. The relative success of this ideal may be accounted for by the large number of skilled workers required for paper and book-making. These workers, their supervisors and the office staffs earned wages high enough to become property owners over time. Indeed, one of the achievements that D. M. Bare mentioned with pride in his autobiography was the high degree of home ownership that Roaring Spring enjoyed by 1920.|$|E

The key element here that brings in cunning is consciousness, or perhaps more to the point, purposeful unconsciousness, or hypocrisy: “This aspect of identification, whereby one can protect an interest merely by not using terms incisive enough to criticize it properly, often brings rhetoric to the edge of cunning” (36).|$|E

Methods: The baseline surveys were conducted during 1998 - 1999 among Japanese (n = 4080) and during 2000 - 2002 among Finnish (n = 8685) public-sector employees. Follow-up surveys were conducted among those still employed, in 2003 (n = 3213) and 2007 (n = 7086), respectively. <b>Occupational</b> <b>class</b> and various explanatory factors were surveyed in the baseline questionnaires. Linear regression models were used for data analysis. Results: BMI was higher at baseline and BMI gain was more rapid in Finland than in Japan. In Finland, baseline BMI was lowest among {{men and women in}} the highest <b>occupational</b> <b>class</b> and progressively increased to the lowest occupational class; no gradient was found in Japan (country interaction effect, P = 0. 020 for men and P < 0. 0001 for women).

It shows heterogeneity in the mortality risks within <b>occupational</b> <b>classes,</b> strongly related to the type of occupational moves experienced. The occupational data are taken from the French longitudinal census sample [...] using 1968 and 1975 census records [...] and mortality risks are estimated over the 1975 - 1980 period, for both <b>occupational</b> <b>classes</b> and pathways between classes.

An inverse relationship is found for unfavorable moves. In most cases, the mortality risks of the movers are in between the risks in the class left and in the class joined. Similar patterns apply to specific groups of women only (upper classes, manual workers, clerks) for which occupational moves are probably driven, as for most men, by mortality related determinants (level of education, qualifications, health, etc.). The findings strongly support the use of a dynamic approach, based on individuals' experiences, to improve our understanding of mortality differentials.

40|$|Abstract Background Physical {{activity}} {{is known to}} have health benefits across population groups. However, less is known about changes over time in socioeconomic differences in leisure-time physical activity and the reasons for the changes. We hypothesised that class differences in leisure-time physical activity would widen over time due to declining physical activity among the lower occupational classes. We examined whether <b>occupational</b> <b>class</b> differences in leisure-time physical activity change over time in a cohort of Finnish middle-aged women and men. We also examined whether a set of selected covariates could account for the observed changes. Methods The data were derived from the Helsinki Health Study cohort mail surveys; the respondents were 40 - 60 -year-old employees of the City of Helsinki at baseline in 2000 - 2002 (n = 8960, response rate 67 %). Follow-up questionnaires were sent to the baseline respondents in 2007 (n = 7332, response rate 83 %). The outcome measure was leisure-time physical activity, including commuting, converted to metabolic equivalent tasks (MET). Socioeconomic position was measured by <b>occupational</b> <b>class</b> (professionals, semi-professionals, routine non-manual employees and manual workers). The covariates included baseline age, marital status, limiting long-lasting illness, common mental disorders, job strain, physical and mental health functioning, smoking, body mass index, and employment status at follow-up. Firstly the analyses focused on changes over time in age adjusted prevalence of leisure-time physical activity. Secondly, logistic regression analysis was used to adjust for covariates of changes in <b>occupational</b> <b>class</b> differences in leisure-time physical activity. Results At baseline there were no <b>occupational</b> <b>class</b> differences in leisure-time physical activity. Over the follow-up leisure-time physical activity increased among those in the higher classes and decreased among manual workers, suggesting the emergence of <b>occupational</b> <b>class</b> differences at follow-up. Women in routine non-manual and manual classes and men in the manual class tended to be more often physically inactive in their leisure-time (30 MET hours/week) than those in the top two classes. Adjustment for the covariates did not substantially affect the observed <b>occupational</b> <b>class</b> differences in leisure-time physical activity at follow-up. Conclusions <b>Occupational</b> <b>class</b> differences in leisure-time physical activity emerged over the follow-up period among both women and men.

Methods: 18 - 34 and 35 - 59 -year-old employees of the City of Helsinki from 2002 to 2016 were included in our data (n = similar to 37, 500 per year). <b>Occupational</b> <b>class</b> was classified into four groups. The magnitude of relative <b>occupational</b> <b>class</b> differences in SA was studied using the relative index of inequality (RII). Results: The relative <b>occupational</b> <b>class</b> differences were larger among older than younger employees; the largest differences were among 35 - 59 -year-old men. Among women in both age-groups the relative class differences remained stable during 2002 - 2016. Among younger and older men, the differences were larger during the beginning of study period than in the end.

We examined trends in medically certified sickness absence by <b>occupational</b> <b>class</b> in Finland from 1996 to 2013 and assessed the magnitude and changes in absolute and relative <b>occupational</b> <b>class</b> differences. Design Population-based, repeated cross-sectional study. Setting A 70 % random sample of Finns aged between 25 and 63 years in the years 1996 - 2013.

This study investigated return to work (RTW) within 2  years after the diagnosis of different types of cancer. Methods This prospective study investigated the associations of demographics (age, gender, socioeconomic status, and residential region) and occupational factors (occupation, duration of employment, and company size) of employees absent from work due to cancer with the time to partial RTW, defined as working at least 50 % of the earnings before sickness absence. Likewise, the associations of demographics and occupational factors with full RTW at equal earnings as before sickness absence were investigated. Results The cohort included 5, 234 employees who had been absent from work due to cancer between January 2004 and December 2006. The time to partial RTW was shortest among employees with skin cancer (median 55  days) and longest among employees with lung cancer (median 377  days). There were no significant associations between RTW and demographics. With regard to the occupational factors, employees in high <b>occupational</b> <b>classes</b> started working earlier than those in low <b>occupational</b> <b>classes,</b> but the time to full RTW did not differ significantly across <b>occupational</b> <b>classes.</b> Employees working in large companies returned to work earlier than those working in small companies.
