25|$|Basanoff {{has argued}} that the legend not only alludes to sex and {{fertility}} in its association with wildfig and goat but is in fact a summary <b>of</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> all the qualities of Juno. As Juno Sespeis of Lanuvium Juno Caprotina is a warrior, a fertiliser and a sovereign protectress. In fact the legend presents a heroine, Tutela, who is a slightly disguised representation of the goddess: the request of the Latin dictator would mask an attempted evocatio of the tutelary goddess of Rome. Tutela indeed shows regal, military and protective traits, apart from the sexual ones. Moreover, according to Basanoff these too (breasts, milky juice, genitalia, present or symbolised in the fig and the goat) in general, and here in particular, have an inherently apotropaic value directly related to the nature of Juno. The occasion of the feria, shortly after the poplifugia, i.e. when the community is in its direst straits, needs the intervention of a divine tutelary goddess, a divine queen, since the king (divine or human) has failed to appear or has fled. Hence the customary battles under the wild figs, the scurrile language that bring together the second and third function. This festival would thus show a ritual that can prove the trifunctional nature of Juno.|$|E

TVLine Michael Slezak was more enthusiastic, {{and said it was}} the [...] "best episode" [...] of the third season; he credited both Helen Mirren and [...] "some righteous plot development that stays true to core characters". Jen Chaney of The Washington Post commented that Glee had [...] "returned to its frequent habit of dropping plots twists on us that come out of nowhere", and MTV's Kevin P.

During a live Ustream chat with fans on July 20, 2010, Swift explained that the song is about [...] "her tendency to run from love" [...] after seeing many relationships end in goodbye and breakups. She continued, [...] "I think I've developed this pattern <b>of</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> running away when it comes time to fall in love and to stay in a relationship.

500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN graded {{the episode}} 8.1 out of 10, calling it [...] "pretty damn busy and quite fun", {{highlighting}} Skye's character {{development and the}} drama it caused, {{as well as the}} connections to [...] "Pilot", as high points of the episode. He praised the [...] "dark, but also necessary" [...] deaths depicted, and concluded that the series [...] "is beginning to build its story in an intriguing way." [...] James Hunt at Den of Geek found the episode to be [...] "mostly, quite good," [...] praising Skye's story, the idea that S.H.I.E.L.D. [...] "might actually be as bad as the people they're trying to fight", and the character of Raina, who he called [...] "the closest thing this series has yet had to an original, interesting idea". Hunt criticized the dialogue, and found the character of Chan Ho Yin to be unrealistic, stating [...] "while I loved the fact that they kind <b>of,</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of,</b> dredged up an actual Marvel character to use in this episode ... it was a shame that he too bore almost no resemblance to an actual person". The Guardians Graeme Virtue also criticized some of the dialogue, but enjoyed the character of Raina and the potential for her to return. He hoped that now Skye's secret has been revealed, [...] "perhaps some of the other agents will get their time in the spotlight." [...] Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter decided that the [...] "episode wasn't as good as [...] "Eye Spy"—by the time we got to the last two segments, I really didn’t care what happened to “Scorch,”—but it was still better than the first three. It was all just so very ... perfunctory." ...|$|E
