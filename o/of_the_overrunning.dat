In the end, the application and development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high speed <b>overrunning</b> clutch are discussed according to <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transmission system that have high reliability, long life and light weight. Function <b>of</b> <b>the</b> High Speed <b>Overrunning</b> Clutch in <b>the</b> Transmission System <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Helicopter <b>The</b> high speed <b>overrunning</b> clutch is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{critical components}}. When the power system drives the rotor system, <b>the</b> high <b>overrunning</b> clutch is on engagement mode that <b>the</b> speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driven part always tries to be equal to that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> driver.

2500|$|The {{commission}} {{found that}} the approach and landing were normal with natural variations but that the spoilers were not deployed when the pilot pulled the lever. No conclusion to the cause was found, although the commission believed it must either have been a mechanical fault in the spoiler lever mechanism or a fault in two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four thrust lever micro switches. The pilots received warning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> failure <b>of</b> deployment and also noticed <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> sufficient retardation, but failed to connect the two issues, instead focusing on the wheel brakes. This caused <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anti-skid system, which caused hydroplaning and subsequently reduced braking effect. <b>The</b> lack <b>of</b> runway grooving was decisive for the hydroplaning to take place. The aircraft was estimated to travel at [...] at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>overrun.</b> Had optimum braking taken place the aircraft would probably {{have come to a}} stop on the runway.
