25|$|Ketamine is {{absorbable}} by intravenous, intramuscular, oral, and topical routes due to {{both its}} water and lipid solubilities. When administered orally, it undergoes first-pass metabolism, {{where it is}} biotransformed in the liver by CYP3A4 (major), CYP2B6 (minor), and CYP2C9 (minor) isoenzymes into norketamine (through N-demethylation) and finally dehydronorketamine. Intermediate in the biotransformation of norketamine into dehydronorketamine is the hydroxylation of norketamine into hydroxynorketamine by CYP2B6 and CYP2A6. Dehydronorketamine, followed by norketamine, is the most prevalent metabolite detected in urine. As the major metabolite of ketamine, norketamine is one-third to one-fifth as potent as an anesthetic, and plasma levels of this metabolite are three times higher than ketamine following oral administration. Bioavailability through the <b>oral</b> <b>route</b> reaches 17–20%; bioavailability through other routes are: 93% intramuscularly, 25–50% intranasally, 30% sublingually, and 30% rectally. Peak plasma concentrations are reached within a minute intravenously, 5–15 min intramuscularly, and 30 min orally. Ketamine's duration of action in a clinical setting is 30 min to 2 h intramuscularly and 4–6 h orally.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{measured}} the bioavailability of glucosamine after oral administration to horses. When given as a single oral dose (nine grams) with or without chondroitin sulfate (three grams) to ten horses, glucosamine (hydrochloride) was detected in the blood with a maximum level of 10.6 (+/- 6.9) micrograms per millilitre at two hours after dosing. Another study examined both the serum and the joint synovial fluid after nasogastric (oral) or intravenous administration of 20mg/kg glucosamine hydrochloride to eight adult horses. Although joint fluid concentrations of glucosamine reached 9 - 15 micromolar following intravenous dosing, it was only 0.3 - 0.7 micromolar with nasogastric dosing. The authors calculated that these glucosamine synovial fluid levels achieved by the <b>oral</b> <b>route</b> were 500 fold lower than that required to {{have a positive effect on}} the metabolism of cartilage cells. A follow up study by the same research group compared glucosamine sulfate with glucosamine hydrochloride at the same dose (20mg/kg) in eight horses and found a higher fluid concentration with the sulfate preparation (158ng/mL compared to 89ng/mL one hour post oral dose). They concluded that these higher synovial fluid levels obtained with the sulfate derivative were still too low to have a relevant biological effect on articular cartilage.|$|E

This study sought to characterize a live attenuated subspecies novicida-based vaccine strain (U 112 ΔiglB) in an established second rodent model of pulmonary tularemia, namely the Fischer 344 rat using two distinct routes of vaccination (intratracheal [i. t. ] and oral). Attenuation was verified by comparing replication of U 112 ΔiglB with wild type parental strain U 112 in F 344 primary alveolar macrophages. U 112 ΔiglB exhibited an LD(50) > 10 (7) CFU compared to the wild type (LD(50) = 5 × 10 (6) CFU i. t.). Immunization with 10 (7) CFU U 112 ΔiglB by i. t. and <b>oral</b> <b>routes</b> induced antigen-specific IFN-γ and potent humoral responses both systemically (IgG 2 a>IgG 1 in serum) and at the site of mucosal vaccination (respiratory/intestinal compartment). Importantly, vaccination with U 112 ΔiglB by either i. t. or <b>oral</b> <b>routes</b> provided equivalent levels of protection (50 % survival) in F 344 rats against a subsequent pulmonary challenge with ~ 25 LD(50) (1. 25 × 10 (4) CFU) of the highly human virulent strain SCHU S 4. Collectively, these results provide further evidence on the utility of a mucosal vaccination platform with a defined subsp. novicida U 112 ΔiglB vaccine strain in conferring protective immunity against pulmonary tularemia...|$|R
40|$|The {{disposition}} of amopyroquin was studied in rats after a single 50 -mg/kg (body weight) oral dose of amopyroquin base. After a rapid absorption phase, the drug concentrations decreased in the plasma, with a terminal half-life of 14. 5 h. The drug was widely {{distributed in the}} liver and lungs and, to a lesser extent, in the kidneys and spleen. In rabbits, the kinetic parameters were compared after a single 10 -mg/kg dose of amopyroquin base through intravenous, intramuscular (i. m.), and <b>oral</b> <b>routes.</b> The similar bioavailability values (0. 67 and 0. 69) suggested that the drug could be used through i. m. or oral administration.

The ratio of concentrations in erythrocytes and plasma was about 5 in rats and rabbits. Three metabolites were detected in both animal species (one was tentatively identified as the primary amine derivative). The amopyroquin in vitro activity was tested against four chloroquine-susceptible and 11 chloroquine-resistant African Plasmodium falciparum strains.

This {{is supported by the}} positive results of the NTP bioassays with Ni sub-sulfide and Ni oxide in rats and mice. The human and animal data consistently indicate a lack of carcinogenicity via the <b>oral</b> <b>route</b> of exposure and limit the carcinogenicity of nickel compounds to respiratory tumours after inhalation. Nickel metal is classified as a suspect carcinogen; there is consistency between the absence of increased respiratory cancer risks in workers predominantly exposed to metallic nickel and the lack of respiratory tumours in a rat lifetime inhalation carcinogenicity study with nickel metal powder. In the rodent inhalation studies with various nickel compounds and nickel metal, increased lung inflammations with and without bronchial lymph node hyperplasia or fibrosis were observed. In rat studies, oral ingestion of water soluble nickel salts can trigger perinatal mortality effects in pregnant animals. Whether these effects are relevant to humans is unclear as epidemiological studies of highly exposed female workers have not shown adverse developmental toxicity effects.|$|E

40|$|White spot {{syndrome}} virus (WSSV) is {{a devastating}} pathogen in shrimp aquaculture. Standardized challenge procedures using a known amount of infectious virus would assist in evaluating strategies {{to reduce its}} impact. In this study, the shrimp infectious dose 50 % endpoint (SID 50 ml - 1) of a Thai isolate of WSSV was determined by intramuscular inoculation (i. m.) in 60 and 135 d old specific pathogen-free (SPF) Litopenaeus vannamei using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and 1 -step polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Also, the lethal dose 50 % endpoint (LD 50 ml - 1) was determined from the proportion of dead shrimp. The median virus infection titers in 60 and 135 d old juveniles were 10 (6. 8) and 10 (6. 5) SID 50 ml - 1, respectively. These titers {{were not significantly different}} (p >= 0. 05). The titration of the WSSV stock by oral intubation in 80 d old juveniles resulted in approximately 10 -fold reduction in virus titer compared to i. m. inoculation. This lower titer is probably the result of physical and chemical barriers in the digestive tract of shrimp that hinder WSSV infectivity. The titers determined by infection were identical to the titers determined by mortality in all experiments using both i. m. and <b>oral</b> <b>routes</b> at 120 h post inoculation (hpi), indicating that every infected shrimp died.
