25|$|The free mining {{arrangement}} {{under the}} rules of the Duchy of Lancaster was the normal state of affairs in the Duchy manor of Wirksworth. The Duchy's lessee of the mineral rights {{at the end of the}} sixteenth century, Gilbert, Earl of Shrewsbury, had established his right to the dues of lot and cope against attempts by local landowners to assert right to mines on their land. Shrewsbury's success embedded the <b>old</b> <b>rules</b> and facilitated free mining.|$|E
25|$|Edward Dorsey {{was convicted}} of unlawfully selling 5.5 grams of crack in 2008. As a prior {{offender}} under the pre-2010 sentencing rules, {{he would have been}} subject to a 10-year minimum; under the new law, he would have been not been subject to any such minimum due to the small nature of his possession. The sentencing judge sentenced Dorsey to the 10-year minimum, applying the <b>old</b> <b>rules</b> because the conviction occurred prior to the effective date of the new law. This was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.|$|E
25|$|The Leadville strike had winnowed out miners {{who were}} {{antagonistic}} toward, or not fully {{supportive of the}} union's goals. The members who were left agreed that they {{were engaged in a}} class-based struggle that called for a more militant and confrontational disposition. Employers themselves had dictated the <b>old</b> <b>rules</b> for the struggle, but after Leadville the union no longer believed those rules applied. Many of the WFM members were moving beyond reformist sentiments, to a realization that if they were to obtain the just solution that they sought, the system needed to be overturned. In a document called the November 1897 proclamation, the union miners and their allies vowed to launch a new federation which would reflect their growing class consciousness.|$|E

In 1969, IIHF had loosened amateur rules by permitting bodychecking anywhere in the rink (<b>old</b> <b>rules</b> allowed bodychecking only in defensive end). SM-sarja underwent a tactical revolution as physical, mean play became a means to success. Lampainen, however, reckoned physical play unsuitable for the line-up at hand (consider nallipyssyketju). He guided the team, with success, towards a play that demanded technique and clever tactics.

2500|$|Enigma is a German musical project {{founded in}} 1990 by Romanian-German {{musician}} and producer Michael Cretu. Cretu had released several solo records, collaborated with various artists, and produced albums for his then wife, German pop singer Sandra, before he conceived {{the idea of}} a New Age, Worldbeat project. He recorded the first Enigma studio album, MCMXC a.D. (1990), with contributions from David Fairstein and Frank Peterson. The album remains Enigma's biggest, helped by the international hit single, [...] "Sadeness (Part I)", which sold 12 million units alone. According to Cretu, the inspiration for the creation of the project came from his desire to make a kind of music that did not obey [...] "the <b>old</b> <b>rules</b> and habits" [...] and presented a new form of artistic expression with mystic and experimental components.|$|E
2500|$|Titles {{of former}} aristocrats (like Graf for [...] "Count") have become {{parts of the}} Nachname in Germany, giving longer names of several words, usually {{including}} the nobiliary particle von (meaning [...] "of") or zu (meaning [...] "to", sometimes [...] "at"), often von und zu are also found together (meaning [...] "of and to/at"). The legal rules for these names {{are the same as}} those for other Nachnamen, which gives rise to a number of cases where people legally bear such names but are not recognized by the associations of formerly noble families in Germany, which continue to apply the <b>old</b> <b>rules</b> of the German Empire in their publications. Most of these cases come about when a woman of noble descent marries a man with no title, and the two adopt the woman's name as their common Nachname, which was impossible under imperial law.|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to provide a common {{foundation}} to the theories of correctness of program transformations for a large variety of programming languages. We consider the notion of rule set and the notion of inductive set which is dened by a rule set. We also consider a class of transformations of rule sets, called rule replacements, which replace an <b>old</b> <b>rule</b> set by a new rule set. These replacements can be viewed as generalizations of the most commonly used transformations, such as folding and unfolding. We study two methods for proving the correctness of rule replacements, that is, for showing that the <b>old</b> <b>rule</b> set and the new rule set dene the same inductive set. These methods are: (i) the Unique Fixpoint Method, based on the well-foundedness property of the new rule set, and (ii) the Improvement Method, based on the fact that the premises of the <b>old</b> <b>rule</b> set are replaced by premises which have `smaller' proofs w. r. t. a suitable well-founded relation.

2500|$|More formal {{rulemaking}} to {{give the}} Service's interpretation of a statute, or when the statute itself directs that the Secretary of the Treasury shall provide, IRS undergoes the formal regulation process with a Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published in the Federal Register announcing the proposed regulation, {{the date of the}} in-person hearing, and the process for interested parties to have their views heard either in person at the hearing in Washington, D.C., or by mail. Following the statutory period provided in the Administrative Procedure Act the Service decides on the final regulations [...] "as is," [...] or as reflecting changes, or sometimes withdraws the proposed regulations. Generally, taxpayers may rely on proposed regulations until final regulations become effective. For example, human resource professionals are relying on the October 4, 2005 Proposed Regulations (citation 70 F.R. 57930-57984) for the Section 409A on deferred compensation (the so-called Enron rules on deferred compensation to add teeth to the <b>old</b> <b>rules)</b> because regulations have not been finalized.|$|E
2500|$|... "On 1 September 2010, {{new rules}} of Belarusian orthography came into force.

As {{a result of these}} new rules, the existing 50- and 50,000-ruble notes dated 2000 now technically contain errors where the denominations are spelled out on the notes. On 29 December 2010, the National Bank of Belarus introduced new 50- and 50,000-ruble banknotes to bring the inscriptions on the notes into compliance with the new rules of Belarusian spelling and punctuation.

2500|$|A {{contemporary}} of Rebbi, therefore (about 160-220)—hardly Rebbi himself—may {{have been}} {{the author of the}} Derek Ereẓ, R., the first three sections being added much later. A collection known as Hilkot Derek Ereẓ existed even in the school of Rabbi Akiva (Ber. 22a); but, as the term [...] "Hilkot" [...] indicates, it was composed entirely of short sentences and rules of behavior and custom, without any references to Jewish Scripture and tradition. It is even highly probable that the treatise was based on the older collection, and that the work of the later editors consisted merely in the addition to the <b>old</b> <b>rules</b> of illustrations from the Bible and from history. For example, in the old collection there was a rule, [...] "No one must enter the house of another without due announcement." [...] This sentence was amplified by a later editor, who added: [...] "This rule of behavior is taught out of the mouth of God Himself, who stood at the gate of paradise and called to Adam, 'Where art thou?'" [...] (Gen. iii. 9); and to this is added the story of a journey of Jewish scholars to Ancient Rome, and how they comported themselves there (section v.).|$|E

2500|$|The {{causes of}} the French Revolution are complex and are still debated among historians. Following the Seven Years' War and the American Revolutionary War, the French {{government}} was deeply in debt and attempted to restore its financial status through unpopular taxation schemes, which were heavily regressive. Years of bad harvests {{leading up to the}} Revolution also inflamed popular resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the clergy and the aristocracy. Demands for change were formulated in terms of Enlightenment ideals and contributed to the convocation of the Estates-General in May 1789. The first year of the Revolution saw members of the Third Estate (commoners) taking control, the assault on the Bastille in July, the passage of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in August, and a women's march on Versailles that forced the royal court back to Paris in October. A central event of the first stage, in August 1789, was the abolition of feudalism and the <b>old</b> <b>rules</b> and privileges left over from the Ancien Régime. The next few years featured political struggles between various liberal assemblies and right-wing supporters of the monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms. [...] The Republic was proclaimed in September 1792 after the French victory at Valmy. In a momentous event that led to international condemnation, Louis XVI was executed in January 1793.|$|E
2500|$|The {{operation}} of the <b>old</b> <b>rules</b> and customs in the Wirksworth Wapentake did not prevent {{the development of a}} complicated structure there. The barmasters' ore accounts, identifying mines and/or proprietors, reveal a mixture of free mining, ownership of large mines by rich entrepreneurs and the rewashing of old spoil heaps. Where there was a rich source of ore and especially where access required dewatering, the mines were owned by venture capitalists employing miners either as contracted groups, who considered themselves as free miners negotiating a price for their work or, more rarely, as wage labourers. The barmasters' accounts for 1653 [...] show that the ore from the Brassington, Middleton and Wirksworth liberties, all low producers at the time, consisted of small amounts mined by a large number of names. Clearly, in these liberties, at this time, it was the small-time miners, most of whom would have had other sources of income, usually farming, who were paying their dues and selling to the lead merchants and smelters. In a fourth liberty, Cromford, the picture was different. With the Dovegang dewatered by Vermuyden's Sough (see below), the output there dwarfed the combined output of the other three liberties, and 51% of it came from mines owned by the rich lead merchant, Lionel Tynley. 88% came from four sources, while the rest was mined by 45 independent miners. Finally, 6,108 loads (about 1,527 tons), or 23% of the total ore sold in the four liberties, was won from old hillocks by so-called [...] "cavers".|$|E
2500|$|Body {{contact between}} runner and fielder is {{frequent}} in baseball, particularly at home plate. This is driven {{to a large}} extent by the manner in which a runner is put out. In both sports, rules prohibit interfering with runners. However, in baseball, the runner himself (or the base he is advancing to, if forced) must be tagged by a fielder holding the ball, to be put out. The catcher awaiting a throw will often stand between the plate and the runner. Once he catches it, the runner might try to go around the catcher, or he might simply bowl the catcher over, if he thinks he can dislodge the ball by such contact; and if the catcher does not have the ball, the runner may still bowl the catcher over, which is considered fair because by rule a fielder without a ball cannot impede a runner. By contrast, in cricket, the stumps are the target for [...] "tagging" [...] rather than the runner. No contact with the runners is either necessary or allowed. Contact between opposing sides is rare, and is usually not deliberate. Violent contact between players was once even greater in baseball, as before the Knickerbocker Rules it was permitted in some versions of the game to literally [...] "throw out" [...] a runner by hitting him (or [...] "soaking" [...] him) with a thrown ball (in lieu of hitting a base or stake that would equate to cricket's wickets). This rule still exists in some versions of the baseball variant called kickball, which is played with a soccer ball and thus is much less injurious. Except when played batting in a hands-down position, kickball also calls for literal [...] "bowling" [...] of the ball, underhand, as with the <b>old</b> <b>rules</b> of both cricket and baseball. [...] "All 'round hands down" [...] kickball leagues exist, but in most of these, the ball is pitched with the face or shoulders.|$|E
