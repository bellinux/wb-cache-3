40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This PhD takes a social constructionist approach (see Burr, 2003) to explore how professional women in Sri Lanka make sense of and enact their careers. By explaining career through the recursive relationship between social context and individual agency, this study adds new insights into existing understandings of women <b>s</b> <b>careers</b> which are dominated by psychological models of women s development over their lifespans (see Maneiro and Sullivan, 2005; O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005; Pringle and Dixon, 2003). Most importantly this study which addresses women s experiences in Sri Lanka fulfils a significant gap in the extant literature which has paid only little attention to careers in South Asian nations. This study is based on qualitative interviews (see King, 2004) conducted with 24 professional Sri Lankan women: eight in early career, eight in mid-career and eight in late career (see O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005). All respondents aspired to reach the highest possible level in their organisations hierarchies and therefore continuously engaged with work organisations, home and family and wider contextual structures in Sri Lanka in pursuit of achieving their career goals, contributing towards maintaining and/or transforming these social structures in the process. Based on these findings I developed a theoretical framework to understand women <b>s</b> <b>careers</b> in a dynamic and contextually significant manner. This framework highlights eight different strategies women use to develop their careers which has four possible social outcomes. In illuminating specifically what women do to advance their careers within their social contexts and with what implications this framework makes {{a significant contribution to}} the careers literature which gives only little attention to individuals career strategies. Moreover by appreciating both social context and individual agency as explanations of women <b>s</b> <b>careers</b> this model refrains from taking an overly deterministic (see McRae, 2003; Crompton, 2011) or voluntaristic (see Maneiro and Sullivan, 2005; O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005) stance to conceptualising women <b>s</b> <b>career</b> development. Second, I outline a South Asian model of women <b>s</b> <b>career</b> development highlighting family, moral notions, religious philosophies and wider belief systems such as astrology and horoscopes as central constituents of women <b>s</b> <b>careers.</b> I highlight how these understandings could be used to identify blind spots in existing literature and further develop prevailing ideas of women <b>s</b> <b>careers</b> in the West. Specifically I argue that traditional notions do not altogether disappear as societies develop (see Gerth and Mills, 1991), but rather individuals use these notions to walk towards modernity. Finally I conclude the thesis by outlining how scholars could develop my work further, calling upon authors to bring moral character, traditional notions and enchantment back to the careers field.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method for the {{automatic}} decipherment of lost langauges. Given a non-parallel corpus in a known related language, our model produces both alphabetic mappings and translations of words into their corresponding cognates. We employ a non-parametric Bayesian framework to simultaneously capture both low-level character mappings and high-level morphemic correspondences. This formulation enables us to encode some of the linguistic intuitions that have guided human decipherers. When applied to the ancient Semitic language Ugaritic, the model correctly maps nearly all letters to their Hebrew counterparts, and deduces the correct Hebrew cognate for over half of the Ugaritic words which have cognates in Hebrew.

However, because women have been socialized to be Dassive and self-effacing, they nay be contributing to their secondary status by managing their careers less effectively than men.

40|$|Family relocations within {{developed}} countries are argued to have gendered consequences for paid employment, with men 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>careers</b> improving and women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>careers</b> deteriorating. However, {{little is known}} about their potential relationships with outcomes in other life domains, including partnered men 2 ̆ 7 s and women 2 ̆ 7 s relative shares of domestic labor. The authors addressed this gap in knowledge by theorizing and examining how within-couple gender gaps in domestic work evolve across short- and long-distance family relocations over the life course, paying attention to the over-time dynamics before and after event occurrence. To accomplish this, they used 12 years of panel data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey and panel regression models. The results indicated that family relocations widen the within-couple gender gap in weekly housework hours, largely because of shifts in women 2 ̆ 7 s employment situation and fertility episodes that accompany residential relocations...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{examines}} William Stetson Merrill, the compiler of A Code for Classifiers and a Newberry Library employee (1889 ‐ 1930) in {{an attempt}} to glean lessons for modern information studies from an early librarian 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>career.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Merrill 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>career</b> at the Newberry Library and three editions of the code are briefly examined using historical, bibliographic, and conceptual methods. Primary and secondary sources in archives and libraries are summarized to provide insight into Merrill 2 ̆ 7 s attempts to develop or modify tools to solve the knowledge organization problems he faced. The concept of bricolage, developed by Levi‐Strauss to explain modalities of thinking, is applied to Merrill 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>career.</b> Excerpts from his works and reminisces are used to explain Merrill as a bricoleur and highlight the characteristics of bricolage. Findings – Findings show that Merrill worked collaboratively to collocate and integrate a variety of ideas from a diverse group of librarians such as Cutter, Pettee, Poole, Kelley, Rudolph, and Fellows. Bliss and Ranganathan were aware of the code but {{the extent to which they}} were influenced by it remains to be explored. Although this is an anachronistic evaluation, Merrill serves as an example of the archetypal information scientist who improvises and integrates methods from bibliography, cataloging, classification, and indexing to solve problems of information retrieval and design usable information products and services for human consumption. Originality/value – Bricolage offers great potential to information practitioners and researchers today as we continue to try and find user‐centered solutions to the problems of digital information organization and services...|$|R
