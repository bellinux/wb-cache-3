5|$|In ctenophores, {{bioluminescence}} {{is caused}} by the activation of calcium-activated proteins named photoproteins in cells called photocytes, which are often confined to the meridional canals that underlie the eight comb rows. In the genome of Mnemiopsis leidyi ten genes encode photoproteins. These genes are co-expressed with <b>opsin</b> genes in the developing photocytes of Mnemiopsis leidyi, raising the possibility that light production and light detection may be working together in these animals.|$|E
5|$|Since cone cells make {{color vision}} possible, the high {{prevalence}} of rod cells in lemur eyes suggest {{they have not}} evolved color vision. The most studied lemur, the ring-tailed lemur, {{has been shown to}} have blue-yellow vision, but lacks the ability to distinguish red and green hues. Due to polymorphism in <b>opsin</b> genes, which code for color receptivity, trichromatic vision may rarely occur in females of a few lemur species, such as Coquerel's sifaka (Propithecus coquereli) and the red ruffed lemur (Varecia rubra). Most lemurs, therefore, are either monochromats or dichromats.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a {{reflective}} layer, called the tapetum lucidum, that improves low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the <b>opsin</b> gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E
50|$|Type II <b>opsins</b> fall phylogenetically {{into four}} groups: C-opsins (Ciliary), Cnidops (cnidarian <b>opsins),</b> R-opsins (rhabdomeric), and Go/RGR <b>opsins</b> (also known as RGR/Go or Group 4 <b>opsins).</b> The Go/RGR <b>opsins</b> {{are divided into}} four sub-clades: Go-opsins, RGR, Peropsins, and Neuropsins. C-opsins, R-opsins, and the Go/RGR <b>opsins</b> are found only in Bilateria.|$|R
50|$|The peropsins {{are one of}} {{the four}} subgroups of the Go/RGR <b>opsins,</b> also known as RGR/Go or Group 4 <b>opsins.</b> Go/RGR <b>opsins</b> {{are one of the}} four major groups of type-II <b>opsins,</b> also known as {{metazoan}} or animal <b>opsins.</b> The Go/RGR <b>opsins</b> consist of four groups: The Go-opsins, the RGR-opsins, the peropsins, and the neuropsins. Animal <b>opsins</b> belong to four classes: C-opsins (ciliary), R-opsins (rhabdomeric), Cnidops (cnidarian), and Go/RGR-opsins. Three of these subclades occur only in Bilateria (all but Cnidops). However, the bilaterian clades constitute a parphyletic taxon without the Cnidops.|$|R
50|$|Type II <b>opsins</b> (or animal <b>opsins)</b> are, like Type I <b>opsins,</b> {{members of}} the seven-transmembrane-domain {{proteins}} (35-55 kDa) of the GPCR superfamily.|$|R
25|$|The opsins (photopigments) {{present in}} the L and M cones are encoded on the X chromosome; {{defective}} encoding of these leads to the two most common forms of color blindness. The OPN1LW gene, which codes for the <b>opsin</b> {{present in the}} L cones, is highly polymorphic (a recent study by Verrelli and Tishkoff found 85 variants {{in a sample of}} 236 men). A very small percentage of women may have an extra type of color receptor because they have different alleles for the gene for the L <b>opsin</b> on each X chromosome. X chromosome inactivation means that while only one <b>opsin</b> is expressed in each cone cell, both types occur overall, and some women may therefore show a degree of tetrachromatic color vision. Variations in OPN1MW, which codes the <b>opsin</b> expressed in M cones, appear to be rare, and the observed variants have no effect on spectral sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|The <b>opsin</b> protein group evolved {{long before}} the last common {{ancestor}} of animals, and has continued to diversify since.|$|E
25|$|Each {{individual}} cone contains pigments {{composed of}} <b>opsin</b> apoprotein, which is covalently linked to either 11-cis-hydroretinal or more rarely 11-cis-dehydroretinal.|$|E
50|$|Type I <b>opsins</b> are seven-transmembrane-domain {{proteins}} {{belonging to}} the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. Type I <b>opsins</b> (also known as microbial <b>opsins)</b> are found in all three domains of life: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukaryota. In Eukaryota, type I <b>opsins</b> are found mainly in unicellular organisms such as green algae, and in fungi. In most complex multicellular eukaryotes, type I <b>opsins</b> have been replaced with other light-sensitive molecules such as cryptochrome and phytochrome in plants, and type II <b>opsins</b> in Metazoa (animals).|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two groups}} of protein termed <b>opsins.</b> [...] type I <b>opsins</b> are {{employed}} by prokaryotes and by some algae (as a component of channelrhodopsins) and fungi, whereas animals use type II <b>opsins.</b> No <b>opsins</b> have been found outside these groups (for instance in plants, or placozoans).|$|R
50|$|Type I <b>opsins</b> (like channelrhodopsin, halorhodopsin, and archaerhodopsin) {{are used}} in optogenetics to switch on or off {{neuronal}} activity. Type I <b>opsins</b> are preferred if the neuronal activity should be modulated at higher frequency, because they respond faster than type II <b>opsins.</b> This is because type I <b>opsins</b> are ion channels or proton/ion pumps and thus are activated by light directly, while type II <b>opsins</b> activate G-proteins, which then activate effector enzymes that produce metabolites to open ion channels.|$|R
25|$|The huge {{diversity}} seen in {{mantis shrimp}} photoreceptors likely comes from ancient gene duplication events. One interesting {{consequence of this}} duplication {{is the lack of}} correlation between <b>opsin</b> transcript number and physiologically expressed photoreceptors. One species may have 6 different <b>opsin</b> genes, but only express one spectrally distinct photoreceptor. Over the years, some mantis shrimp species have lost the ancestral phenotype, although some still maintain 16 distinct photoreceptors and 4 light filters. Species that live in a variety of photic environments have high selective pressure for photoreceptor diversity, and maintain ancestral phenotypes better than species that live in murky waters or are primarily nocturnal.|$|E
25|$|Early amniotes {{had four}} opsins in the cones of their retinas {{to use for}} {{distinguishing}} colours: one sensitive to red, one to green, and two corresponding to different shades of blue. The green <b>opsin</b> was not inherited by any crown mammals, but all normal individuals did inherit the red one. Early crown mammals thus had three cone opsins, the red one and both of the blues. All their extant descendants have lost one of the blue-sensitive opsins but not always the same one: marsupials and placentals (except for cetaceans) retain one blue-sensitive <b>opsin</b> while monotremes retain the other. Some placentals and marsupials, including humans, subsequently evolved green-sensitive opsins; like early crown mammals, therefore, their vision is trichromatic.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} birds are tetrachromatic, with {{dedicated}} cone cells for perceiving wavelengths in the ultraviolet and violet regions of the light spectrum. These cells contain a combination of short wave sensitive (SWS1) opsins, SWS1-like opsins (SWS2), and long-wave filtering carotenoid pigments for selectively filtering and receiving light between 300 and 400 nm. There {{are two types of}} short wave color vision in birds: violet sensitive (VS) and ultraviolet sensitive (UVS). Single nucleotide substitutions in the SWS1 <b>opsin</b> sequence are responsible blue-shifting the spectral sensitivity of the <b>opsin</b> from violet sensitive (λmax = 400) to ultraviolet sensitive (λmax = 310-360). This is the proposed evolutionary mechanism by which ultraviolet vision originally arose. The major clades of birds that have UVS vision are Palaeognathae (ratites and tinamous), Charadriiformes (shorebirds, gulls, and alcids), Trogoniformes (trogons), Psittaciformes (parrots), and Passeriformes (perching birds, representing {{more than half of all}} avian species).|$|E
50|$|Early {{tetrapods}} {{inherited a}} set of five rod and cone <b>opsins</b> known as the vertebrate <b>opsins.</b>|$|R
50|$|Teleost fish <b>opsins</b> is {{expressed}} in many tissues and therefore called Teleost Multiple Tissue (TMT) <b>opsins.</b> TMT <b>opsins</b> form three groups which are most closely related to a fourth groups the panopsins. In fact, TMT <b>opsins</b> in teleost fish are orthologous to the panopsins in the other vertebrates. They also have the same introns and the same place, which confirms that they belong together.|$|R
50|$|<b>Opsins</b> {{function}} {{by acting}} as enzymes that are activated and change shape when light absorption causes chromophores to isomerize. <b>Opsins</b> {{are responsible for}} adjusting wavelength dependence of the chromophore light induced isomerization reaction. Therefore, <b>opsins</b> act by determining chromophore sensitivity to light at any given wavelength. <b>Opsins</b> that have different amino acid sequences but are bound to identical chromophores result in different absorption values at each wavelength.|$|R
25|$|Many {{different}} geometric isomers of retinol, retinal and {{retinoic acid}} are possible {{as a result}} of either a trans or cis configuration of four of the five double bonds found in the polyene chain. The cis isomers are less stable and can readily convert to the all-trans configuration (as seen in the structure of all-trans-retinol shown here). Nevertheless, some cis isomers are found naturally and carry out essential functions. For example, the 11-cis-retinal isomer is the chromophore of rhodopsin, the vertebrate photoreceptor molecule. Rhodopsin is composed of the 11-cis-retinal covalently linked via a Schiff base to the <b>opsin</b> protein (either rod <b>opsin</b> or blue, red or green cone opsins). The process of vision relies on the light-induced isomerisation of the chromophore from 11-cis to all-trans resulting in a change of the conformation and activation of the photoreceptor molecule. One of the earliest signs of vitamin A deficiency is night-blindness followed by decreased visual acuity.|$|E
25|$|The photoreceptors in Drosophila {{express a}} variety of {{rhodopsin}} isoforms. The R1-R6 photoreceptor cells express rhodopsin1 (Rh1), which absorbs blue light (480nm). The R7 and R8 cells express a combination of either Rh3 or Rh4, which absorb UV light (345nm and 375nm), and Rh5 or Rh6, which absorb blue (437nm) and green (508nm) light, respectively. Each rhodopsin molecule consists of an <b>opsin</b> protein covalently linked to a carotenoid chromophore, 11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal.|$|E
25|$|Up to 150 {{mutations}} {{have been}} reported to date in the <b>opsin</b> gene associated with the RP since the Pro23His mutation in the intradiscal domain of the protein was first reported in 1990. These mutations are found throughout the <b>opsin</b> gene and are distributed along the three domains of the protein (the intradiscal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains). One of the main biochemical causes of RP in the case of rhodopsin mutations is protein misfolding, and the disruption of molecular chaperones. It was found that the mutation of codon 23 in the rhodopsin gene, in which proline is changed to histidine, accounts for the largest fraction of rhodopsin mutations in the United States. Several other studies have reported various codon mutations associated with Retinitis Pigmentosa, including Thr58Arg, Pro347Leu, Pro347Ser, as well as deletion of Ile-255. In 2000, a rare mutation in codon 23 was reported causing autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, in which proline changed to alanine. However, this study showed that the retinal dystrophy associated with this mutation was characteristically mild in presentation and course. Furthermore, there was greater preservation in electroretinography amplitudes than the more prevalent Pro23His mutation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>Opsins</b> are a {{large group}} of {{proteins}} with seven transmembrane segments (TMSs) that are found in all domains of life. There are two types of <b>opsins</b> that are sometimes considered nonhomologous: type I is known from prokaryotes and some eukaryotes, while type II is known only from Eumetazoan animals. Type II <b>opsins</b> are members of the family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which facilitate signal transduction across cell membranes. While previous studies have concluded that multiple transmembrane-containing protein families— including type I opsins—originated by internal domain duplication, the origin of type II <b>opsins</b> has been speculated on but never tested. Here we show that type II <b>opsins</b> do not appear to have originated through a similar internal domain duplication event. This provides further evidence that the two types of <b>opsins</b> are nonhomologous, indicating a convergent evolutionary origin, in which both groups of <b>opsins</b> evolved a seven-TM structure and light sensitivity independently. This convergence may indicate an important role for seven-TM protein structure for retinal-based light sensitivity...|$|R
50|$|Cone <b>opsins</b> are {{categorized}} {{further by}} their absorption maxima λ max {{which is the}} wavelength when {{the greatest amount of}} light absorption takes place. Further categorization of cone <b>opsins</b> also depends on the specific amino acid sequences each of the <b>opsins</b> uses, which may have an evolutionary basis.|$|R
50|$|The neuropsins {{constitute}} one of {{the four}} subclades of the Go/RGR group of <b>opsins,</b> also known as RGR/Go or Group 4. Go/RGR is {{one of the}} four major subclades of type-II <b>opsins,</b> also known as metazoan or animal <b>opsins.</b> Go/RGR comprises Go-coupled, RGR, peropsins, and neuropsins. Type-II <b>opsins</b> comprise four subclades: C-opsins (ciliary), R-opsins (rhabdomeric), Cnidops (cnidarian), and Go/RGR. Three of these subclades occur only in Bilateria (all but Cnidops). However, the bilaterian clades constitute a parphyletic taxon without Cnidops.|$|R
25|$|Eyes {{in various}} animals show {{adaptation}} to their requirements. For example, {{the eye of}} a bird of prey has much greater visual acuity than a human eye, and in some cases can detect ultraviolet radiation. The different forms of eye in, for example, vertebrates and molluscs are examples of parallel evolution, despite their distant common ancestry. Phenotypic convergence of the geometry of cephalopod and most vertebrate eyes creates the impression that the vertebrate eye evolved from an imaging cephalopod eye, {{but this is not the}} case, as the reversed roles of their respective ciliary and rhabdomeric <b>opsin</b> classes and different lens crystallins show.|$|E
25|$|However, {{even among}} primates, full color vision differs between New World and Old World monkeys. Old World primates, {{including}} monkeys and all apes, have vision similar to humans. New World monkeys {{may or may}} not have color sensitivity at this level: in most species, males are dichromats, and about 60% of females are trichromats, but the owl monkeys are cone monochromats, and both sexes of howler monkeys are trichromats. Visual sensitivity differences between males and females in a single species is due to the gene for yellow-green sensitive <b>opsin</b> protein (which confers ability to differentiate red from green) residing on the X sex chromosome.|$|E
25|$|The four spectrally {{distinct}} cone pigments {{are derived}} from the protein <b>opsin,</b> linked to a small molecule called retinal, which {{is closely related to}} vitamin A. When the pigment absorbs light the retinal changes shape and alters the membrane potential of the cone cell affecting neurons in the ganglia layer of the retina. Each neuron in the ganglion layer may process information from a number of photoreceptor cells, and may in turn trigger a nerve impulse to relay information along the optic nerve for further processing in specialised visual centres in the brain. The more intense a light, the more photons are absorbed by the visual pigments; the greater the excitation of each cone, and the brighter the light appears.|$|E
50|$|Arthropods use {{different}} <b>opsins</b> in their different eye types, {{but at least}} in Limulus the <b>opsins</b> expressed in the lateral and the compound eyes are 99% identical and presumably diverged recently.|$|R
5000|$|Type II visual <b>opsins</b> are {{traditionally}} classified as either ciliary or rhabdomeric. Ciliary <b>opsins,</b> found in vertebrates and cnidarians, attach to ciliary {{structures such as}} rods and cones. Rhabdomeric <b>opsins</b> are attached to light-gathering organelles called rhabdomeres. This classification cuts across phylogenetic categories (clades) so that both the terms [...] "ciliary" [...] and [...] "rhabdomeric" [...] can be ambiguous. Here, [...] "C-opsins (ciliary)" [...] refers to a clade found exclusively in Bilateria and excludes cnidarian ciliary <b>opsins</b> such as {{those found in the}} box jellyfish. Similarly, [...] "R-opsin (rhabdomeric)" [...] includes melanopsin even though it does not occur on rhabdomeres in vertebrates.|$|R
50|$|These pineal <b>opsins,</b> {{found in}} the Actinopterygii (ray-finned fish) {{apparently}} arose {{as a result of}} gene duplication from Rh1 (rhodopsin). These <b>opsins</b> appear to serve functions similar to those of pinopsin found in birds and reptiles.|$|R
25|$|A {{variety of}} retinal {{molecular}} pathway defects have been matched to multiple known RP gene mutations. Mutations in the rhodopsin gene, {{which is responsible}} for the majority of autosomal-dominantly inherited RP cases, disrupts the rod-opsin protein essential for translating light into decipherable electrical signals within the phototransduction cascade of the central nervous system. Defects in the activity of this G-protein-coupled receptor are classified into distinct classes that depend on the specific folding abnormality and the resulting molecular pathway defects. The Class I mutant protein's activity is compromised as specific point mutations in the protein-coding amino acid sequence affect the pigment protein's transportation into the outer segment of the eye, where the phototransduction cascade is localized. Additionally, the misfolding of Class II rhodopsin gene mutations disrupts the protein's conjunction with 11-cis-retinal to induce proper chromophore formation. Additional mutants in this pigment-encoding gene affect protein stability, disrupt mRNA integrity post-translationally, and affect the activation rates of transducin and <b>opsin</b> optical proteins.|$|E
25|$|Transduction is {{the process}} through which energy from {{environmental}} stimuli is converted to neural activity for the brain to understand and process. The back of the eye contains three different cell layers: photoreceptor layer, bipolar cell layer and ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer {{is at the very}} back and contains rod photoreceptors and cone photoreceptors. Cones are responsible for color perception. There are three different cones: red, green and blue. Rods, are responsible for the perception of objects in low light. Photoreceptors contain within them a special chemical called a photopigment, which are embedded in the membrane of the lamellae; a single human rod contains approximately 10 million of them. The photopigment molecules consist of two parts: an <b>opsin</b> (a protein) and retinal (a lipid). There are 3 specific photopigments (each with their own color) that respond to specific wavelengths of light. When the appropriate wavelength of light hits the photoreceptor, its photopigment splits into two, which sends a message to the bipolar cell layer, which in turn sends a message to the ganglion cells, which then send the information through the optic nerve to the brain. If the appropriate photopigment is not in the proper photoreceptor (for example, a green photopigment inside a red cone), a condition called color vision deficiency will occur.|$|E

50|$|Cnidaria, {{which include}} jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones, {{are the most}} basal animals to possess complex eyes. Jellyfish <b>opsins</b> in the rhopalia couple to Gs-proteins raising the {{intracellular}} cAMP level. Coral <b>opsins</b> can couple to Gq-proteins and Gc-proteins. Gc-proteins are a subtype of G-proteins specific to cnidarians. The cnidarian <b>opsins</b> {{have been identified as}} one group and so called cnidops, however {{at least some of them}} belong to the c-opsins, r-opsins, and Go/RGR-opsins found in bilaterians.|$|R
5000|$|Melanopsin, {{like all}} other animal <b>opsins</b> (e.g. rhodopsin), {{is a member of}} the G-protein coupled {{receptor}} (GPCR) family. The melanopsin protein has seven alpha helices integrated in the plasma membrane, an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain. It resembles invertebrate <b>opsins</b> far more than vertebrate photopigments, especially in its amino acid sequence and downstream signaling cascade. [...] Like invertebrate <b>opsins,</b> it appears to be a photopigment with intrinsic photoisomerase activity and signals through a G-protein of the Gq family.|$|R
5000|$|Ciliary <b>opsins</b> (or c-opsins) are {{expressed}} in ciliary photoreceptor cells, and include the vertebrate visual <b>opsins</b> and encephalopsins.
