5|$|Because planetesimals are so numerous, {{and spread}} {{throughout}} the protoplanetary disk, some survive {{the formation of a}} planetary system. Asteroids are understood to be left-over planetesimals, gradually grinding each other down into smaller and smaller bits, while comets are typically planetesimals from the farther reaches of a planetary system. Meteorites are samples of planetesimals that reach a planetary surface, and provide a great deal <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> formation of the Solar System. Primitive-type meteorites are chunks of shattered low-mass planetesimals, where no thermal differentiation took place, while processed-type meteorites are chunks from shattered massive planetesimals.|$|E

5|$|During the Byzantine millennium, {{hardly a}} year passed without a {{military}} campaign. Soldiers were {{a normal part}} of everyday life, much more so than in modern Western societies.

5|$|De Materia Medica is {{the prime}} {{historical}} source <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> medicines used by the Greeks, Romans, and other cultures of antiquity. The work also records the Dacian names for some plants, which {{otherwise would have been}} lost. The work presents about 600 plants in all, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from these sources. Botanists have not always found Dioscorides' plants easy to identify from his short descriptions, partly because he had naturally described plants and animals from southeastern Europe, whereas by the sixteenth century his book was in use all over Europe and across the Islamic world. This meant that people attempted to force a match between the plants they knew and those described by Dioscorides, leading to what could be catastrophic results.|$|E

Part of the ceremonial costume {{worn by the}} Incan priest was based upon a colour painting of Mexican Aztecs produced by Else Bostelmann for the National Geographic Society which Hergé had a copy of in his files. He ensured that his depiction of the Peruvian trains was accurate by basing them upon examples found in a two-volume picture encyclopedia of railways published by Librarie Hachette in 1927.|$|E

5|$|Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot {{coined the}} {{binomial}} Dromaiusater in 1817. In 1906, Walter Baldwin Spencer coined the name Dromaiusminor {{based on some}} Pleistocene subfossil bones and eggshells found on King Island the same year, believing {{they were the first}} physical evidence of an emu from there. William Vincent Legge also coined a name for these remains, Dromaiusbassi, but at a later date. In his 1907 book Extinct Birds, Walter Rothschild stated that Vieillot's description actually referred to the mainland emu, and that the name D.ater was therefore invalid. Believing the skin in Muséum national d'Histoire naturelle of Paris was from Kangaroo Island, he made it the type specimen of his new species Dromaiusperoni, named after the French naturalist François Péron, who is the main source <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> bird in life.|$|E
5|$|Nine shelters {{throughout}} the Northern Mariana Islands were opened to accommodate families needing assistance. Several schools opened classrooms as evacuation centers.

The Guam Memorial Hospital officials advised all pregnant women within 32weeks of their delivery date to check in. The Guam Office of Civil Defense filed the paperwork for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to declare the island a disaster area. Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez took similar measures to declare a state of emergency for the area. Following experience from previous typhoons, Guam newspaper Pacific Daily News underwent preparations to provide internet updates for the storm, including reinforcing the building, maintaining sufficient food supplies for the staff, and stationing two reporters elsewhere on the island; the paper was the only immediate source <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> typhoon outside of Guam.|$|E
5|$|The Galileo {{spacecraft}} was {{the first}} to have entered orbit around Jupiter, arriving in 1995 and studying the planet until 2003. During this period Galileo gathered a large amount <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Jovian system, making close approaches to all of the four large Galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them, as well as the possibility of liquid water beneath their surfaces. It also discovered a magnetic field around Ganymede. As it approached Jupiter, it also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9. In December 1995, it sent an atmospheric probe into the Jovian atmosphere, so far the only craft to do so.|$|E

Students attended lectures for three years and spent the fourth year in private study of Paulus' Responsa; they had the option to stay for a fifth year to study imperial constitutions. The students of each year were distinguished by special nicknames: first year, Dupondii; second, Edictales; third, Papinianistae; fourth, Lytae.|$|E
5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to orbit Jupiter was the Galileo orbiter, which went into orbit around Jupiter on December 7, 1995.

During this period, it gathered a large amount <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Jovian system; {{the amount of information}} was not as great as intended because the deployment of its high-gain radio transmitting antenna failed. The major events during the eight-year study included multiple flybys of all of the Galilean moons, as well as Amalthea (the first probe to do so). It also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 as it approached Jupiter in 1994 and the sending of an atmospheric probe into the Jovian atmosphere in December 1995.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary source}} <b>of</b> <b>information</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> reign of Andrianampoinimerina is Tantara ny Andriana eto Madagasikara, a Malagasy {{language}} book relating the oral {{history of the}} Merina kings as collected by a Jesuit missionary, Francois Callet, in the late 19th century. Prior to the eventual release of a French language translation in the 1950s, references to the king in academic and popular writing {{during the colonial period}} de-emphasized his role as a conduit of traditional religious power and authority, instead glorifying his administrative practices in an attempt to bring greater credibility to the colonial government as a vehicle for building upon and strengthening the principles of good governance that he introduced. Beginning in the 1970s, historians began to focus more on the spiritual aspects of his role as king, and researchers questioned and compared sources in an effort to arrive at a more factual and balanced history of Andrianampoinimerina and his reign.|$|E
