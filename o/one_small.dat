5|$|A {{growing number}} of astronomers argued for Pluto to be declassified as a planet, because many similar objects {{approaching}} its size {{had been found in}} the same region of the Solar System (the Kuiper belt) during the 1990s and early 2000s. Pluto was found to be just <b>one</b> <b>small</b> body in a population of thousands.|$|E

5|$|AJS {{group was}} {{wound up in}} 1991, and the company's {{director}} Bob Howells bought County Bus & Coach through a new holding company, Lynton Travel Group.

5|$|After the battle, Steuart {{was sent}} as a {{prisoner}} of war to Charleston, South Carolina, and was later imprisoned at Hilton Head, where he and other officers were placed under the fire of Confederate artillery. The fighting at Spotsylvania was to prove the end of his brigade. Johnson's division, 6,800 strong {{at the start of the}} battle, was now so severely reduced in size that barely one brigade could be formed. On May 14 the brigades of Walker, Jones, and Steuart were consolidated into <b>one</b> <b>small</b> brigade under the command of Colonel Terry of the 4th Virginia Infantry.|$|E
5|$|An {{isolated}} severe thunderstorm in {{the outer}} bands of Allison produced an F1 tornado in Worcester and Middlesex Counties in Massachusetts, impacting over 100trees and damaging one house and <b>one</b> <b>small</b> camper. A microburst in Leominster and another in Shirley damaged several trees. Lightning from the storm hit two houses, causing significant damage there but little elsewhere. Allison also produced moderate rainfall in the state, mainly ranging from 3 to 5inches (75 to 125mm). The rainfall caused drainage and traffic problems. Damage in Massachusetts totaled to $400,000 (2001USD, $520,000 2012USD).|$|E
5|$|At 3:54p.m. BST on 23 July 2011, two {{ambulances}} {{were called}} to Winehouse's home in Camden, London. Winehouse was pronounced dead at the scene. Shortly afterwards, the Metropolitan Police confirmed that she had died. After her death was announced, media and camera crews appeared, as crowds gathered near Winehouse's residence to pay their respects. Forensic investigators entered the flat as police cordoned off the street outside; they recovered <b>one</b> <b>small</b> and two large bottles of vodka from her room. After her death, the singer broke her second Guinness World Record: for the most songs by a woman to simultaneously appear on the UK singles chart, with eight.|$|E

5|$|Camel {{hybridisation}} {{began in}} the first millennium BC. For about a thousand years, Bactrian camels and dromedaries have been successfully bred in regions where they are sympatric to form hybrids with either a long, slightly lopsided hump or two humps – <b>one</b> <b>small</b> and one large. These hybrids are larger and stronger than their parents – they can bear greater loads. A cross between a first generation female hybrid and a male Bactrian camel can also produce a hybrid. Hybrids from other combinations tend to be bad-tempered or runts.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, {{the only}} Class-A fishery {{waters in the}} Nescopeck Creek {{watershed}} were those of Little Nescopeck Creek A, the headwaters of Nescopeck Creek, and several minor tributaries of Nescopeck Creek. Only <b>one</b> <b>small</b> stream near Nescopeck Creek's mouth had Class-C fishery waters. The central part of Nescopeck Creek, {{as well as most}} of Black Creek had Class-D fishery waters. There were twenty species of fish in Nescopeck Creek in 1999. Of these, seventeen had been seen in the watershed before. However, since between a 1999 study of the watershed and the study before that, the brown bullhead and the bluegill fish had vanished from the Nescopeck Creek watershed.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, {{the commune}} had eight primary schools with 19 {{teachers}} for 595 children. There were 20 mahadras, or traditional schools, in 11 locations. Only four had a library or document repository. There were 11 writing rooms of varying quality, and <b>one</b> <b>small</b> vocational training centre. By 2007, the commune had 11 primary schools with 689 students (45percent {{of whom were}} girls) and 28 teachers, but no secondary school. Only three schools had desks. All had latrines, but not all had drinking water or facilities for preparing meals for the children. The quality of education was mixed.|$|E

5|$|In June 2007, SDSU {{was deemed}} the number <b>one</b> <b>small</b> {{research}} {{university in the}} nation. The ranking was determined based on faculty productivity, honorary awards, publications in journals, and number of research grants received. At any point, the campus usually has around 800 studies in progress in various fields. A 2007 study revealed that the campus has an economic impact of $2.4 billion on the San Diego region. Due to projections of current and future growth, the study indicated that the school's economic impact {{is expected to increase}} to $4.5 billion by 2025.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, {{a number}} of programs, such as the IAI Harpy or the AGM-136 Tacit Rainbow, {{integrated}} anti-radiation sensors into a drone or missile air frames coupled with command and control and loitering capabilities. This allowed the attacking force to place relatively cheap munitions in place over suspected SAM sites, and to attack promptly the moment the SAM battery is visible. This integrated {{the use of a}} drone as a baiting decoy with the attack role into <b>one</b> <b>small</b> and relatively cheap platform in comparison to the alternative wild weasel jet fighter.|$|E
5|$|On {{the north}} side, the Midway High Lakes Area, which lies mostly outside the {{wilderness}} area, {{is one of}} the more popular areas around Mount Adams. The area is made up of four large lakes, Council Lake, Takhlakh Lake, Ollalie Lake, and Horseshoe Lake; <b>one</b> <b>small</b> lake, Green Mountain Lake; and a group of small lakes, Chain of Lakes. The area offers developed and primitive camping as well as a good number of trails for hiking and backpacking. Most trails are open to horses and many outside the wilderness are open to motorcycles. More scenery similar to what is encountered in the Mount Adams Wilderness abounds. The area also offers boating and fishing opportunities on several of the lakes.|$|E
