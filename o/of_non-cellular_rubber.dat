30|$|These {{mechanisms}} generally presume {{for certain}} types of cancers which show natural or inherent resistance to chemotherapeutic drug at the initial exposure. MDR may occur as a consequence <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> mechanisms arising from solid tumor growth in vivo. The solid tumors suffer from poor vascularisation, hypoxia and accessibility to the drug. It limits the drug-induced cytotoxicity and also reduces the friction of vulnerable cells due to presence of non-cycling tumor cells resistant to proliferation-dependent drugs [207]. Such growth environment favors the proliferation of cancer cells to proliferate which is markedly {{different from that of}} the normal cells. Inadequate nutrition and hypoxia due to poor vasculature resulting in lactic acid accumulation helps to generate resistance to cancer cells against drugs as the cellular uptake of drug needs pH gradient [208].|$|R
40|$|Upper-respiratory viral {{infection}} in humans is mediated {{by a number}} of factors. Anti-viral proteins, changes in gene expression, and the release of specific signaling molecules are all elements of a healthy immune response to a potential pathogen. These complex immune processes and components have not yet been well characterized. In this project, we specifically explored the nature <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> constituents that help fight {{viral infection}}. Nasal lavage—a technique in which saline solution is used to rinse the nasal cavity, allowing for the collection and solvation of certain antiviral compounds—was performed on human subjects.

40|$|The {{reactive}} {{response of}} brain tissue to implantable intracortical microelectrodes {{is thought to}} negatively affect their recordable signal quality and impedance, resulting in unreliable longitudinal performance. The relationship between the progression of the reactive tissue into a glial scar and the decline in device performance is unclear. We show that exposure to a model protein solution in vitro and acute implantation result in both resistive and capacitive changes to electrode impedance, rather than purely resistive changes. We also show that applying 4000 MW polyethylene glycol (PEG) prevents impedance increases in vitro, and reduces the percent change in impedance in vivo following implantation. Our results highlight the importance of considering the contributions <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> components to the decline in neural microelectrode performance, and present a proof of concept for using a simple dip-coated PEG film to modulate changes in microelectrode impedance...|$|R
50|$|While Butterfield {{agreed that}} the dark patches round the foot served as gills, he denied that they were similar in {{structure}} and mode of development to molluscan ctenidia. In his opinion the flattened remains of Odontogriphus were formed by relatively tough extracellular secretions, such as jaws, bristles and toughened skin, and do not include purely or primarily cellular tissues, such as muscles or gonads. He therefore thought the respiratory organs round the edge of Odontogriphus’ foot could not be molluscan ctenidia, since these are covered by purely cellular tissue. Instead he suggested {{that they might be}} brachiopod lophophores, which are feeding organs that contain a lot of extracellular material, or polychaete branchiae, which are respiratory organs composed largely <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> cuticle - both of these types of structure have been found in the Burgess Shale, in which all the known specimens of Odontogriphus have been discovered.|$|R

The exoskeleton may be organic (chitin, polysaccharide or protein) or made of the mineral calcium carbonate. The body wall consists of the epidermis, basal lamina (a mat <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> material), connective tissue, muscles, and the mesothelium which lines the coelom (main body cavity) - except that in one class, the mesothelium is split into two separate layers, the inner one forming a membranous sac that floats freely and contains the coelom, and the outer one attached to the body wall and enclosing the membranous sac in a pseudocoelom. The other {{main part of the}} bryozoan body, known as the polypide and situated almost entirely within the cystid, contains the nervous system, digestive system, some specialized muscles and the feeding apparatus or other specialized organs that take the place of the feeding apparatus.|$|R
40|$|Current {{treatment}} of T cell mediated autoimmune diseases relies mostly on strategies of global immunosuppression, which, {{in the long}} term, is accompanied by adverse side effects such as a reduced ability to control infections or malignancies. Therefore, new approaches {{need to be developed}} that target only the disease mediating cells and leave the remaining immune system intact. Over the past decade a variety of cell based immunotherapy strategies to modulate T cell mediated immune responses have been developed. Most of these approaches rely on tolerance-inducing antigen presenting cells (APC). However, in addition to being technically difficult and cumbersome, such cell-based approaches are highly sensitive to cytotoxic T cell responses, which limits their therapeutic capacity. Here we present a protocol for the generation <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> killer artificial antigen presenting cells (KaAPC), which allows for the depletion of pathologic T cells while leaving the remaining immune system untouched and functional. KaAPC is an alternative solution to cellular immunotherapy which has potential for treating autoimmune diseases and allograft rejections by regulating undesirable T cell responses in an antigen specific fashion...|$|R

40|$|Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSC) can {{differentiate}} into several cell types and are desirable candidates for cell therapy and tissue engineering. However, due to poor cell survival, proliferation and differentiation in the patient, the therapy outcomes {{have not been}} satisfactory. Although several {{studies have been done}} to understand the conditions that promote proliferation, differentiation and migration of MSC in vitro and in vivo, still there is no clear understanding on the effect <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> bio molecules. <b>Of</b> the many factors that influence the cell behavior, the immediate cell microenvironment plays a major role. In this context, we studied the effect of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in controlling cell survival, proliferation, migration and directed MSC differentiation. We found that collagen promoted cell proliferation, cell survival under stress and promoted high cell adhesion to the cell culture surface. Increased osteogenic differentiation accompanied by high active RHOA (Ras homology gene family member A) levels was exhibited by MSC cultured on collagen. In conclusion, our study shows that collagen will be a suitable matrix for large scale production of MSC with high survival rate and to obtain high osteogenic differentiation for therapy...|$|R

40|$|Varying {{numbers of}} human blood {{lymphocytes}} were stimulated by concanavalin A (Con-A) {{in a constant}} medium volume. At 'low' cell densities DNA synthesis was proportional {{to the number of}} cells in the cultures whereas at 'high' densities DNA synthesis was considerably lower than expected. In the presence of non-mitogenic microcarrier beads, (diameter 195 micrometer) to which the cells attached, DNA synthesis was proportional or nearly proportional to the cell number in the cultures also at 'high' cell densities. The potentiating effect of beads on lymphocyte stimulation was particularly noteworthy in individuals showing a weak mitogen response. Another approach that yielded proportionality between DNA synthesis and cell number both at 'low' and 'high' cell densities was the use of culture vessels with a larger bottom area. Under such conditions the presence of beads did not augment DNA synthesis. These results suggest that the availability <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> adhesive surface is a major limiting factor and cell density a major regulating factor in the control of lymphocyte activation. Anchorage of the cells to a surface may modulate the density dependent 'growth control mechanism' indirectly via an influence on cell-cell interaction. An alternative less-likely interpretation is that the contact with non-cellular surfaces directly gives rise to regulatory responses in lymphocytes or accessory cells...|$|R
40|$|Phaeocystis pouchetii is an ecologically {{important}} colony-forming {{marine phytoplankton}} species in northern hemisphere cold waters. It plays {{a central role}} in the processing of biogeochemically important elements in the upper ocean during spring blooms. Here, we report highly significant quantitative relationships among colony size, cell number and particulate carbon and nitrogen contents of field populations of P. pouchetii, which provide the means to quantitatively convert its biological expression into units of biogeochemical significance. Populations were sampled from mesocosms incubated in situ in western Norway and either fertilized with nitrate and phosphate or left unamended. Phaeocystis colony blooms developed in both scenarios, but were much greater in fertilized treatments. Colonies from the latter treatments were larger, contained higher concentrations of cells and more particulate carbon and nitrogen than those in the unfertilized mesocosm. Considering all data, log cell number increased linearly with log colony volume with a slope of 0. 54. Log carbon and nitrogen increased with log colony volume, with respective slopes of 0. 92 and 1. 22, indicating a significant component <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> carbon and nitrogen within the colonies. Carbon and nitrogen contents of colonies were linearly related, and fertilized colonies contained more nitrogen relative to carbon than unfertilized colonies. These equations are particularly applicable to contemporary studies of P. pouchetii because they represent colonies growing in environments that mimic a continuum from natural to eutrophicated ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{the applicability of}} Cellular Manufacturing (CM) techniques in situations where such a configuration is not obvious. Over the years, the academic community has shown a wide interest in CM. Case studies of successful CM implementations and model-based research clearly indicate the merits of typical CM techniques, like set-up reduction, a flow layout, pull production, etc. However, industry surveys indicate that completely cellularized manufacturing systems are rare in practice. Apparently, CM techniques are only applicable to a limited extent. What keeps the non-user from implementing CM techniques is not clear from the literature. Our research forms an attempt to fill this knowledge gap {{by means of a}} multiple case study. Firstly, we address to what extent the techniques of CM are applicable in a number <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> situations. Secondly, we identify the barriers and enablers determining {{the success or failure of}} CM techniques in these situations. Thirdly, we indicate promising issues for further research. The subjects of study are Dutch manufacturing companies, which do not, or only partially, apply CM techniques. The exploration and subsequent analysis of these cases lead to the identification of a number of factors influencing the applicability of CM techniques. Important are an organization’s arsenal of manufacturing technologies, as well as product and demand characteristics. Also the organization of manufacturing and the possibility to exert extensive control over jobs and resources seem important. Some benefits from links between different business functions have also been found. By confronting our findings with the current state of CM research we derive a number of promising directions for further study...|$|R
40|$|The porcine superflexor tendon (SFT) was {{identified}} as having appropriate structure and properties for development of a decellularised device for use in ACL reconstruction. SFTs were decellularised {{using a combination of}} freeze thaw and washes in hypotonic buffer and 0. 1 % (w/v) SDS in hypotonic buffer plus proteinase inhibitors followed by nuclease treatment and sterilisation using peracetic acid. The decellularised biological scaffold was devoid of cells and cell remnants and contained only 13 ng. mg- 1 (dry weight) residual total DNA. Immunohistochemistry showed retention of collagens type I and III and tenascin-C. Quantitative analysis of sulphated sugar and hydroxyproline content revealed a loss of glycosaminoglycans compared to native tissue but no loss of collagen. The decellularised SFT was biocompatible in vitro and in vivo following implantation in a mouse subcutaneous model for 12 weeks. Uniaxial tensile testing to failure indicated that the gross material properties of decellularised SFT were not significantly different to native tissue. Decellularised SFTs had an ultimate tensile strength of 61. 8 ± 10. 3 MPa (± 95 % confidence limits), a failure strain of 0. 29 ± 0. 04 and a Young’s modulus of the collagen phase of 294. 1 ± 61. 9 MPa. Analysis of the presence of the alpha-Gal (galactose-α- 1, 3 -galactose) epitope by immunohistochemistry, lectin binding and antibody absorption assay indicated that the epitope was reduced but still present post decellularisation. This is discussed in light of the potential role <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> alpha-Gal in the acceleration of wound healing and tissue regeneration in the presence of antibodies to alpha-Gal...|$|R

40|$|Objective A {{suboptimal}} uterine environment {{contributes to}} the bovine repeat breeder syndrome. Subclinical endometritis is a component, so the mechanism by which inflammation affects embryo survival was investigated by assessing the effect <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> products <b>of</b> an inflamed endometrium on embryo development to blastocyst. Design Endometrial fluid from a lactating dairy cow was collected by lavage using embryo culture medium. Aseptic inflammation was then induced by infusion of glycogen and lavage was repeated 6 h later. The recovered fluid was used to culture Day 5 in-vitro-derived embryos for 2 days. Embryo development and quality were compared for two treatment groups (culture media conditioned by inflamed or non-inflamed endometrium) and two controls (control or control + serum). Results Development to blastocyst was higher for conditioned media or media + serum (inflamed 42. 2 %; non-inflamed 49. 3 %; control + serum 50. 9 %; control 16. 9 %; P < 0. 001). Blastocyst cell numbers were lower for the conditioned-inflamed group (inflamed, 83. 1; non-inflamed, 99. 8; control + serum, 100. 6; control, 110. 1; P < 0. 001). Trophectoderm cell number, but not inner cell mass number, was reduced in the conditioned-inflamed group and the inner cell mass:trophectoderm ratio was increased (P < 0. 001). Conclusion Altering the embryo culture environment with the products of endometrial inflammation had a subtle effect on embryo quality. An increased inner cell mass:trophoblast ratio is likely to negatively affect embryonic survival. Altered embryo quality is a mechanism for early embryonic failure in cows with subclinical endometritis. Culture of embryos with normal endometrial fluid may improve in vitro embryo production...|$|R
40|$|Myocardial {{interstitial}} fibrosis in experimental uremia—Implications for cardiac compliance. Experimental uremia {{is known to}} cause cardiac hypertrophy. In the present study we examined the effect of uremia with or without concomitant treatment of hypertension by the converting enzyme Ramipril (125 µg/day) on micromorphometric indices of cardiac interstitium at the light microscopical and ultrastructural level. In male sD rats, 21 days of uremia caused an increase of total heart weight (1040 ± 73 mg wet wt vs. 871 ± 81 in controls, P < 0. 05) with an increase of both right and left ventricular weight. This was accompanied by reduction of capillary cross-sectional area despite unchanged capillary length. The volume density (cm 3 /cm 3) of cardiomyocytes was unchanged (0. 881 ± 0. 01 vs. 0. 871 ± 0. 016 in controls), but volume density of interstitial tissue (excluding capillary lumen) was significantly increased (0. 042 ± 0. 011 cm 3 interstitial tissue/cm 3 total heart tissue vs. 0. 019 ± 0. 007 in controls). This was associated with signs of activation of interstitial cells, that is, increased volume of interstitial cell nuclei and interstitial cell cytoplasm. Concomitantly, a significant increase of volume density <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> interstitial ground substance was found which was not normalized by antihypertensive treatment using Ramipril. After three months of uremia, electron microscopy showed collagen fiber deposition in the interstitium. Comparable {{interstitial fibrosis}} was not observed in hearts of rats with renovascular (one clip-two kidney) hypertension. It is concluded that uremia increases myocardial interstitial ground substance by mechanisms independent of hypertension. The data may be relevant for recent findings of diastolic heart malfunction secondary to impaired compliance in uremic patients...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Prostate {{cancer is}} the second leading cause of cancer {{mortality}} in American men. Although serum PSA testing is widely used for early detection, more specific prognostic tests are needed to guide treatment decisions. Recently, the enumeration of circulating prostate epithelial cells {{has been shown to}} correlate with disease recurrence and metastasis following definitive treatment. The purpose of our study was to investigate an immunomagnetic fractionation procedure to enrich circulating prostate tumor cells (CTCs) from peripheral blood specimens, and to apply amplified molecular assays for the detection of prostate-specific markers (PSA, PCA 3 and TMPRSS 2 :ERG gene fusion mRNAs). Results As few as five prostate cancer cells were detected per 5 mL of whole blood in model system experiments using anti-EpCAM magnetic particles alone or in combination with anti-PSMA magnetic particles. In our experiments, anti-EpCAM magnetic particles alone exhibited equivalent or better analytical performance with patient samples compared to a combination of anti-EpCAM + anti-PSMA magnetic particles. Up to 39 % of men with advanced prostate cancer tested positive with {{one or more of the}} molecular assays tested, whereas control samples from men with benign prostate hyperplasia gave consistently negative results as expected. Interestingly, for the vast majority of men who tested positive for PSA mRNA following CTC enrichment, their matched plasma samples also tested positive, although CTC enrichment gave higher overall mRNA copy numbers. Conclusion CTCs were successfully enriched and detected in men with advanced prostate cancer using an immunomagnetic enrichment procedure coupled with amplified molecular assays for PSA, PCA 3, and TMPRSS 2 :ERG gene fusion mRNAs. Our results indicate that men who test positive following CTC enrichment also exhibit higher detectable levels <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular,</b> circulating prostate-specific mRNAs. </p...|$|R

To determine whether this bioacoustic effect was caused by ultrasonic-induced changes in the biofilm morphology (biofilm breakup or disruption), the biofilms were examined by confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM). Such disruption would be undesirable in the possible ultrasonic treatment of implant infections. The CSLM {{results showed that the}} biofilm is a partial monolayer of cells with occasional aggregates <b>of</b> cells, <b>non-cellular</b> materials and extracellular spaces.

The structure of biofilm was not changed when the biofilm was exposed to continuous ultrasound at 500 kHz and 10 mW cm- 2, the same irradiation parameters that increased cell killing by nearly two orders of magnitude.

40|$|Cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) is {{a genetic}} disease mainly {{manifested in the}} respiratory tract. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) {{is the most common}} pathogen identified in cultures of the CF airways, however, its eradication with antibiotics remains challenging as it grows in biofilms that counterwork human immune response and dramatically decrease susceptibility to antibiotics. P. aeruginosa regulates pathogenicity via a cell-to-cell communication system known as quorum sensing (QS) involving the virulence factor (pyocyanin), thus representing an attractive target for coping with bacterial pathogenicity. The first in vivo potent QS inhibitor (QSI) was recently developed. Nevertheless, its lipophilic nature might hamper its penetration <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> barriers such as mucus and bacterial biofilms, which limits its biomedical application. Successful anti-infective inhalation therapy necessitates proper design of a biodegradable nanocarrier allowing: 1) high loading and prolonged release, 2) mucus penetration, 3) effective pulmonary delivery, and 4) maintenance of the anti-virulence activity of the QSI. In this context, various pharmaceutical lipids were used to prepare ultra-small solid lipid nanoparticles (us-SLNs) by hot melt homogenization. Plain and QSI-loaded SLNs were characterized in terms of colloidal properties, drug loading, in vitro release and acute toxicity on Calu- 3 cells. Mucus penetration was studied using a newly-developed confocal microscopy technique based on 3 D-time-lapse imaging. For pulmonary application, nebulization efficiency of SLNs and lung deposition using next generation impactor (NGI) were performed. The anti-virulence efficacy was investigated by pyocyanin formation in P. aeruginosa cultures. Ultra-small SLNs (8 h in simulated lung fluid with minor burst. All types and concentrations of plain and QSI-loaded SLNs maintained the viability of Calu- 3 cells. 3 D time-lapse confocal imaging proved the ability of SLNs to penetrate into artificial sputum model. SLNs were efficiently nebulized; NGI experiments revealed their deposition in the bronchial region. Overall, nanoencapsulated QSI showed up to sevenfold superior anti-virulence activity to the free compound. Most interestingly, the plain SLNs exhibited anti-virulence properties themselves, which was shown to be related to anti-virulence effects of the emulsifiers used. These startling findings represent a new perspective of ultimate significance in the area of nano-based delivery of novel anti-infectives...|$|R
50|$|Arthropod exoskeletons {{are made}} <b>of</b> cuticle, a <b>non-cellular</b> {{material}} secreted by the epidermis. Their cuticles vary {{in the details}} of their structure, but generally consist of three main layers: the epicuticle, a thin outer waxy coat that moisture-proofs the other layers and gives them some protection; the exocuticle, which consists of chitin and chemically hardened proteins; and the endocuticle, which consists of chitin and unhardened proteins. The exocuticle and endocuticle together are known as the procuticle. Each body segment and limb section is encased in hardened cuticle. The joints between body segments and between limb sections are covered by flexible cuticle.|$|R
40|$|How {{long has}} it been since we knew that age-imposed changes in the circulatory milieu are to blame for the {{progressive}} attrition of organs and degenerative disorders that invariably accompany human aging? Some say, we've known for millennia, from the Ancient Greeks and Medieval stories of vampires. Others say that it was McKay’s 1950 s experiments, where old rats were sutured with young rats to establish parabiosis, aka, a joined blood circulation that suggested better health <b>of</b> largely <b>non-cellular</b> cartilage [2]. Yet, another answer is that it has been 10 years since the paradigm-shifting observations that in heterochronic parabiosis, the young systemic milieu rapidly and broadly rejuvenates organ stem cells in muscle, brain/hippocampus and liver, while the old systemic milieu rapidly and broadly ages myogenesis, liver regeneration and neurogenesis, with the responsible biochemical pathways being re-set to their young or old states ([1], and Figure 1). What paradigms have been shifted? Before this work, the prevalent theories of tissue decline in aging focused on cumulative cell intrinsic changes as culprits: telomere attrition, DNA damage, oxidativ...|$|R
5000|$|Turbellarians have no cuticle (external layer <b>of</b> organic but <b>non-cellular</b> material). In a few species {{the skin}} is a syncitium, a {{collection}} of cells with multiple nuclei and a single shared external membrane. However the skins of most species consist of a single layer of cells, each of which generally has multiple cilia (small mobile [...] "hairs"), although in some large species the upper surface has no cilia. These skins are also covered with microvilli between the cilia. They have many glands, usually submerged in the muscle layers below the skin and connect to the surface by pores through which they secrete mucus, adhesives and other substances.|$|R
40|$|Dielectric {{spectroscopy}} is extensively used {{to measure}} the level of viable biomass during fermentations but can suffer from interference by a variety of factors including the presence of dead cells, bubbles, electric and magnetic fields, changes in the medium composition, conductivity changes and the presence <b>of</b> <b>non-cellular</b> particles. Three different approaches were used to overcome these problems. The first involved the separate measurement of the spectra of the interferent and the cells. If the spectra were significantly different then spectra containing the signals of both cells and the interferent could be deconvoluted to separately determine the relative contribution of the cells and the interferent to the spectra. This deconvolution approach was successfully used to estimate the biomass levels of yeast in the presence of spent grains of barley and hardwood in the medium. A similar approach allowed the interference of electrode polarisation on spectra of yeast and microalgae to be compensated for. An attempt to determine the concentration of non-viable cells in a mixture of dead and live cells was less successful because the signal of the non-viable cells was quite small compared to that of viable cells. A second approach involved the use of a filter to keep the interferent away from the probe surface. This was used successfully in the measurement of the yeast concentration in the presence of spent barley grains. A third approach involved the use of a second sensor in addition to the biomass sensor. This allows the signal of the biomass sensor to be compensated for the interferent. In one set of experiments microelectrodes were developed which were able to confine the electric field to a small volume near the electrode surface. Covering the electrode surface with a gel or a membrane stopped cells from entering this volume whilst allowing medium to diffuse through. This allowed the measurement of changes in the electrical properties of the medium without a contribution by the cells. Whilst this approach worked, the response time was too long for practical use. More successful was the simultaneous measurement of the biomass with an infrared optical probe and a dielectric probe. It was found that the signal of the optical probe was independent of the cell viability, whilst the dielectric probe was quite insensitive to non-viable cells. The combined use of the dielectric probe and the optical probe allowed the culture viability to be determined in a straightforward manner...|$|R
