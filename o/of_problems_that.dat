5|$|Implacable {{was laid}} down by Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Co. at their {{shipyard}} in Clydeside on 21 February 1939, as Yard Number 672. Her construction was temporarily suspended in 1940–41, in favour of higher-priority ships needed {{to fight in the}} Battle of the Atlantic, before she was launched on 10 December 1942 by Queen Elizabeth. Captain Lachlan Mackintosh was appointed to command the ship in November 1943. She was commissioned on 22 May 1944, and began sea trials which revealed a significant number <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> required rectification, so the ship was not formally completed until 28 August. Implacable was assigned to the Home Fleet and was working up {{over the next several months}} while the Fairey Fireflies of 1771 Squadron flew aboard on 10 September. The squadron was followed by the Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers of 828 and 841 Squadrons that made up No. 2 Naval Torpedo-Bomber Reconnaissance Wing later that month.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 17th century, {{calculus}} was developed independently and almost simultaneously by Isaac Newton (1642–1727) and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646–1716). This {{was the beginning}} of a new field of mathematics now called analysis. Though not itself a branch of geometry, it is applicable to geometry, and it solved two families <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> had long been almost intractable: finding tangent lines to odd curves, and finding areas enclosed by those curves. The methods of calculus reduced these problems mostly to straightforward matters of computation.|$|E
25|$|Statistical {{techniques}} {{were used to}} determine which, if any, of the criteria were the best indicators of alcoholism. Surprisingly, the answer was that all criteria were of roughly equal importance. No particular indicator or cluster of indicators predominated: it was the number and frequency <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> best defined alcoholism. More importantly, the medical, sociological, and behavioural criteria were equally reliable (i.e. highly correlated). In other words, it was equally valid to call alcoholism a medical or a behavioural disorder—evidence that doctors and sociologists are indeed talking about the same “unitary disorder”.|$|E

It was decided that the standard itself does not infringe their patents, making the standard royalty free. The EPC Gen2 standard was adopted with minor modifications as ISO 18000-6C in 2006.|$|E

25|$|This motivates {{the concept}} of a problem being hard for a {{complexity}} class. A problem X is hard for a class of problems C if every problem in C can be reduced to X. Thus no problem in C is harder than X, since an algorithm for X allows us to solve any problem in C. Of course, the notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> are hard for NP is the set of NP-hard problems.|$|E
25|$|In {{computational}} complexity theory, several complexity {{classes have}} been defined {{in connection with}} implicit graphs, defined as above by a rule or algorithm for listing the neighbors of a vertex. For instance, PPA is the class of problems in which one is given as input an undirected implicit graph (in which vertices are -bit binary strings, with a polynomial time algorithm for listing the neighbors of any vertex) and a vertex of odd degree in the graph, and must find a second vertex of odd degree. By the handshaking lemma, such a vertex exists; finding one {{is a problem in}} NP, but the problems that can be defined in this way may not necessarily be NP-complete, as it is unknown whether PPA=NP. PPAD is an analogous class defined on implicit directed graphs that has attracted attention in algorithmic game theory because it contains the problem of computing a Nash equilibrium. The problem of testing reachability of one vertex to another in an implicit graph may also be used to characterize space-bounded nondeterministic complexity classes including NL (the class <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> may be characterized by reachability in implicit directed graphs whose vertices are -bit bitstrings), SL (the analogous class for undirected graphs), and PSPACE (the class <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> may be characterized by reachability in implicit graphs with polynomial-length bitstrings). In this complexity-theoretic context, the vertices of an implicit graph may represent the states of a nondeterministic Turing machine, and the edges may represent possible state transitions, but implicit graphs may also be used to represent many other types of combinatorial structure. PLS, another complexity class, captures the complexity of finding local optima in an implicit graph.|$|E

In February 2017, the MTA started overnight testing of CBTC on the Flushing Line from Main Street to 74th Street, with CBTC being used in regular passenger service by August and full implementation in October. The rest of the line from 74th Street to Hudson Yards would start operating in passenger service from October to December 2017.|$|E

25|$|For the {{complexity}} classes defined in this way, {{it is desirable}} to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. In particular, although DTIME(n) is contained in DTIME(n2), {{it would be interesting}} to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> can be solved.|$|E
25|$|Most fronts were {{relatively}} quiet throughout 1696: the armies in Flanders, along the Rhine, and in Catalonia, marched and counter-marched but little was achieved. Louis XIV's hesitancy {{to engage with}} the Allies (despite the confidence of his generals) may have reflected {{his knowledge of the}} secret talks that had begun more than a year earlier—with François de Callières acting for Louis XIV, and Jacob Boreel and Everhard van Weede Dijkvelt representing the Dutch. By the spring of 1696 the talks covered the whole panorama <b>of</b> <b>problems</b> <b>that</b> were proving an obstacle to peace. The most difficult of these were the recognition of the Prince of Orange as the King of England and the subsequent status of James II in France; the Dutch demand for a barrier against future French aggression; French tariffs on Dutch commerce; and the territorial settlements in the Rhine–Moselle areas regarding the Reunions and the recent conquests, particularly the strategically important city of Strasbourg. Louis XIV had succeeded in establishing the principle that a new treaty would be fixed {{within the framework of the}} Treaties of Westphalia and Nijmegen, and the Truce of Ratisbon, but with the Emperor's demands for Strasbourg, and William III's insistence that he be recognized as King of England before the conclusion of hostilities, it hardly seemed worthwhile in calling for a peace conference.|$|E
