[...] Its impedance at audio frequencies, and {{especially at the}} more restricted telephone band frequencies, is far from constant. [...] It is possible to manufacture this kind of cable to have a 600 Ω characteristic impedance but it will only be this value at one specific frequency. [...] This might be quoted as a nominal 600 Ω impedance at 800Hz or 1kHz. [...] Below this frequency the characteristic impedance rapidly rises and {{becomes more and more}} dominated by the <b>ohmic</b> <b>resistance</b> of the cable as the frequency falls. [...] At the bottom of the audio band the impedance can be several tens of kilohms. [...] On the other hand, at high frequency in the MHz region, the characteristic impedance flattens out to something almost constant.

40|$|For highly scaled {{submicron}} HEMTs, ultra-low <b>ohmic</b> contact <b>resistances</b> {{are required}} to reduce the drop in intrinsic gm (transconductance) of the device to obtain higher ft and fmax. Moreover, for self-aligned HEMT structures, reducing the <b>ohmic</b> contact <b>resistance</b> becomes the most pivotal issue in attaining better small signal performance and cutoff frequencies. N-face GaN HEMTs, growth direction, offer a natural advantage for this issue over Ga-face GaN HEMTs, since the ohmic contact to the 2 DEG is made through GaN, with lesser band-gap, than AlGaN. In this work we extend the advantage of N-face HEMTs by making use of polarization induced charges through re-growth of graded InGaN ohmic contact regions, to obtain ultra-low and record <b>ohmic</b> contact <b>resistances.</b> An <b>ohmic</b> contact <b>resistance</b> of 27 Ω μm was obtained to a N-face GaN HEMT by regrowth of graded InGaN capped with {{a thin layer of}} InN by plasma MBE.

The model incorporates charge-transfer, mass-transfer, and <b>ohmic</b> <b>resistances</b> to obtain the axial and radial dependencies of the concentration and potential profiles. A linearized Butler-Volmer kinetic expression for a simple redox reaction O + e yielding R is used, in conjuction with analytical expressions for the surface concentration and overpotential, to compute the open-circuit impedance. The results of the two-dimensional model, which omits double-layer charging, are compared with the results of a more standardly applied one-dimensional model in which radial variations are neglected, with and without double-layer charging. The simpler-to-apply one-dimensional model is found to be satisfactory when mass-transfer and <b>ohmic</b> <b>resistances</b> are small with respect to charge-transfer resistance. The omission of double-layer charging does not introduce error into the two-dimensional model in the frequency range in which capacitive-like effects are caused by mass-transfer limitations...|$|R

40|$|A {{microbial}} desalination cell {{was developed}} that contained {{a stack of}} membranes packed with ion exchange resins between the membranes to reduce <b>ohmic</b> <b>resistances</b> and improve performance. This new configuration, called a stacked microbial electro-deionization cell (SMEDIC), was compared to a control reactor (SMDC) lacking the resins. The SMEDIC+S reactors contained both a spacer and 1. 4 ± 0. 2. mL of ion exchange resin (IER) per membrane channel, while the spacer was omitted in the SMEDIC-S reactors and so a larger volume of resin (2. 4 ± 0. 2. mL) was used. The overall extent of desalination using the SMEDIC with a moderate (brackish water) salt concentration (13. g/L) was 90 - 94 %, compared to only 60 % for the SMDC after 7 fed-batch cycles of the anode. At a higher (seawater) salt concentration of 35. g/L, the extent of desalination reached 61 - 72 % (after 10 cycles) for the SMEDIC, compared to 43 % for the SMDC. The improved performance was shown {{to be due to}} the reduction in <b>ohmic</b> <b>resistances,</b> which were 130. Ω (SMEDIC-S) and 180.

Decomposing the transistor thermal resistance into the buffer and substrate components, our study can be easily extended to other substrate materials. Thus, sapphire is substituted with silicon, molybdenum, and SiC, which reduce current-collapse due to SHEs thanks to their considerably higher thermal conductivity, which improves transistor performance. Furthermore, we implement a compact model available for AlGaN/GaN HEMTs, incorporating the temperature dependence of extrinsic source/drain <b>ohmic</b> <b>resistances,</b> which are numerically evaluated for the different substrates. © 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

40|$|Summary ‐ The aim of {{the present}} paper is to {{describe}} a method of measuring capacities of highly conducting media, using a Schering type bridge. The equations of the bridge are discussed, and it is shown how the method set up can be altered to give satisfactory results for frequencies up to 500 kc/s. Using the substitution method capacities can be measured with a reasonable accuracy for frequencies ranging from 10 to 500 kC/s and <b>ohmic</b> <b>resistances</b> not lower than 100 ohms. The bridge was calibrated by means of resistances constructed {{in such a manner}} that the reactance could be calculated from its geometrical form.
