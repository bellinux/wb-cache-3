40|$|We {{estimate}} a {{model of}} natural default probabilities conditional on credit ratings and macroeconomic drivers. The output is an issuer-specific expected default rate at variable horizons, which can be combined to form an expected default rate for a given portfolio of rated credits. This permits us, for the first time, to associate a default rate with a rating category conditional on the future path of the economy. In fact, the model outputs an entire issuer-specific transition matrix, <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>default</b> is only one possible state. The other states include the entire credit rating scale, as well as withdrawal. We are thus able to assign probabilities to the complete future path of a credit rating conditional on the economy. ...|$|R

We compare 12 candidate parameter priors: the Unit Information Prior (UIP) corresponding to the BIC or Schwarz approximation to the integrated likelihood, a proper data-dependent prior, and 10 priors considered by Fernandez et al.

40|$|How {{does the}} {{uncertain}} provision of external finance affect investment projects' default probability and liquidity risk? In this paper, I study the strategic interaction between many creditors {{and a single}} borrower {{in the context of}} a two-period investment project requiring external credit. Loans mature in one period but the project requires two periods to complete. The key working assumptions are that creditors are risk-averse and that any uncertainty is common knowledge: information about the fundamentals can be incomplete but not asymmetric. Mixed and perfect Bayesian strategies are used to compute the equilibrium probabilities of default and early liquidation. The impact of the maturity structure on default and liquidity risk is a function of the underlying structural and stochastic parameters and investors' beliefs about the state of fundamentals. The implications for banking regulation are assessed under fixed and variable loan rates. An open range of fundamentals is derived outside <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>default</b> and liquidity risk are either zero or one. The cyclical properties of default and liquidity risk are shown to depend sensitively on the relative cost of early liquidation to the borrower and the creditors, hence also on the regulatory policy stance...|$|R

Furthermore, we observe two-way Granger causality, which signifies information flow between the two rating agencies. Since lagged rating changes influence {{the magnitude of the}} agencies? own rating changes {{it would appear that the}} two rating agencies apply a policy of taking a severe downgrade through several mild downgrades.

40|$|There is a {{standard}} analysis of default rules in contract law, including those forms of contract law that fall under the label of employment law. But behavioral economics raises many complications. Professor Cass R. Sunstein explains that the default rule can create an endowment effect, making employees value certain rights more, simply {{because they have been}} granted such rights in the first instance. New evidence, based on a survey of law students, is introduced to show a significant endowment effect in the context of vacation time. Similarly, the default rule for savings plans, set by employers or by law, seems to have a large effect on employee behavior. When the default rule affects preferences and behavior, conventional economic analysis seems indeterminate; either default rule can be efficient. In employment law, analysis of distributive consequences also suggests the difficulty <b>of</b> deciding <b>which</b> <b>default</b> rule to favor, because any switch in the rule is unlikely to have significant redistributive effects. Nonetheless, switching the default rule can, in certain circumstances, have desirable effects on workers 2 ̆ 7 welfare.
