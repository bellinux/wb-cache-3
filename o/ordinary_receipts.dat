But the most important difficulty remained behind, and it had not occurred to her until that very evening. It was the want of money; without which it was impossible she could undertake so distant a journey as she now meditated.|$|R

The European State Finance Database (ESFD) is an international collaborative research project for the collection of data in European fiscal history. There are no strict geographical or chronological boundaries to the collection, although data for this collection comprise the period between c. 1200 to c. 1815. The purpose of the ESFD was to establish a significant database of European financial and fiscal records. The data are drawn from the main extant sources {{of a number of}} European countries, as the evidence and the state of scholarship permit. The aim was to collect the data made available by scholars, whether drawing upon their published or unpublished archival research, or from other published material. The ESFD project at the University of Leicester serves also to assist scholars working with the data by providing statistical manipulations of data and high quality graphical outputs for publication. The broad aim of the project was to act as a facilitator for a general methodological and statistical advance in the area of European fiscal history, with data capture and the interpretation of data in key publications as the measurable indicators of that advance. The data were originally deposited at the UK Data Archive in SAS transport format and as ASCII files; however, data files in this new edition have been saved as tab delimited files. Furthermore, this new edition features documentation {{in the form of a}} single file containing essential data file metadata, source details and notes of interest for particular files. Main Topics : The files in this dataset relate to the derived datafiles held in the Leicester database in the directory /rjb/malet/*. *. These data on seventeenth century French revenues and expenditure supplied by the Project Director, Professor Richard Bonney, draw upon J-R Malet, 'Comptes rendus de l'administration des finances du royaume de France, (London, 1789).

60|$|Tom {{was greatly}} {{raised in the}} {{opinions}} of half in the room, by this artful declaration, which was effectually securing just so many friends, {{in the event of}} any occurrence that might render such support necessary. In the mean time, Sir Reginald, assisted by the steward, opened the secretary, and found the deposite of papers. The leases were all in order; the title-deeds were properly arranged; the books and accounts appeared to be exactly kept: <b>ordinary</b> bills and <b>receipts</b> were filed with method; two or three bags of guineas proved that ready cash was not wanting; and, in short, every thing showed that the deceased had left his affairs in perfect order, and in a very intelligible condition. Paper after paper, however, was opened, and nothing like a will, rough draft or copied, was to be found. Disappointment was strongly painted on the faces of all the gentlemen present; for, they had ignorantly imbibed the opinion, that the production of a will would, in some unknown manner, defeat the hopes of the soi-disant Sir Thomas Wychecombe. Nor was Tom, himself, altogether without concern; for, since the recent change in his uncle's feelings towards himself, he had a secret apprehension that some paper might be found, to defeat all his hopes. Triumph, however, gradually assumed the place of fear, in the expression of his countenance; and when Mr. Furlong, a perfectly honest man, declared that, from the late baronet's habits, {{as well as from the}} result of this search, he did not believe that any such instrument existed, his feelings overflowed in language.|$|R
40|$|Foster {{care workers}} are an {{important}} part of the social service system, as they are the first line of support for children without families or who have been subjected to tragic events leading to their need for foster care. Foster care workers often experience work-life boundary issues due to the emotional nature of their work. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the relationship between (a) emotional intelligence and absenteeism and (b) emotional intelligence and work-life balance with foster care workers. Data was collected from foster care workers in the state of South Carolina employed with the Department of Social Services (n= 200). Participants completed the Emotional Social Competency Inventory (ESCI) and the Work Related Quality of Life Scale (WRQoL) via pen and paper and email <b>receipts.</b> <b>Ordinary</b> least squares regression was used, including methods for mediation testing; multivariate analysis of covariance was also carried out for robustness testing purposes. No significant relationship was found between emotional intelligence and absenteeism. There was a significant relationship between various elements of emotional intelligence and various elements of work-life balance, but the effect sizes were small (3 ̆e 0. 04). There were no significance effects based on the results for absenteeism. Overall, the results illuminate the role of emotional intelligence on the work and life balance of foster care workers. One recommendation for future research would be to distinguish between voluntary and involuntary absenteeism. The results of the study can be used by organizations that employ foster care workers to improve the work and life balance and the effects of absenteeism in this line of work...|$|R
