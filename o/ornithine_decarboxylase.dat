5|$|Although most proteasomal {{substrates}} must be ubiquitinated {{before being}} degraded, {{there are some}} exceptions to this general rule, especially when the proteasome plays a normal role in the post-translational processing of the protein. The proteasomal activation of NF-κB by processing p105 into p50 via internal proteolysis is one major example. Some proteins that are hypothesized to be unstable due to intrinsically unstructured regions, are degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner. The most well-known example of a ubiquitin-independent proteasome substrate is the enzyme <b>ornithine</b> <b>decarboxylase.</b> Ubiquitin-independent mechanisms targeting key cell cycle regulators such as p53 have also been reported, although p53 is also subject to ubiquitin-dependent degradation. Finally, structurally abnormal, misfolded, or highly oxidized proteins are also subject to ubiquitin-independent and 19S-independent degradation under conditions of cellular stress.|$|E
5|$|Suicide {{inhibition}} is {{an unusual}} type of irreversible inhibition where the enzyme converts the inhibitor into a reactive form in its active site. An example is the inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, α-difluoromethylornithine or DFMO, which is an analogue of the amino acid ornithine, and is used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). <b>Ornithine</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> can catalyse the decarboxylation of DFMO instead of ornithine, as shown above. However, this decarboxylation reaction {{is followed by the}} elimination of a fluorine atom, which converts this catalytic intermediate into a conjugated imine, a highly electrophilic species. This reactive form of DFMO then reacts with either a cysteine or lysine residue in the active site to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme.|$|E

2500|$|NO exerts {{antiproliferative}} effects by cGMP-dependent inhibiting Ca2+ influx or by directly inhibiting {{the activity}} of arginase and <b>ornithine</b> <b>decarboxylase,</b> decreasing the generation of polyamides required for DNA synthesis. NO also has antithrombotic effects that result of its diffusion across platelet membrane and sGC activation, resulting in inhibition of platelet aggregation. Moreover, NO affects leukocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium by inhibiting the [...] nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which induces vascular endothelial expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules.|$|E
2500|$|Since Harlow's {{pioneering}} work on touch research in development, recent work in rats has {{found evidence that}} touch during infancy resulted in a decrease in corticosteroid, a steroid hormone involved in stress, {{and an increase in}} glucocorticoid receptors in many regions of the brain. Schanberg and Field found that even short-term interruption of mother–pup interaction in rats markedly affected several biochemical processes in the developing pup: a reduction in <b>ornithine</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> (ODC) activity, a sensitive index of cell growth and differentiation; a reduction in growth hormone release (in all body organs, including the heart and liver, and throughout the brain, including the cerebrum, cerebellum, and brain stem); an increase in corticosterone secretion; and suppressed tissue ODC responsivity to administered growth hormone. Additionally, it was found that animals who are touch-deprived have weakened immune systems. Investigators have measured a direct, positive relationship between the amount of contact and grooming an infant monkey receives during its first six months of life, and its ability to produce antibody titer (IgG and IgM) in response to an antibody challenge (tetanus) at a little over one year of age. Trying to identify a mechanism for the [...] "immunology of touch", some investigators point to modulations of arousal and associated CNS-hormonal activity. Touch deprivation may cause stress-induced activation of the pituitary–adrenal system, which, in turn, leads to increased plasma cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone. Likewise, researchers suggest, regular and [...] "natural" [...] stimulation of the skin may moderate these pituitary–adrenal responses in a positive and healthful way.|$|E

5000|$|In {{molecular}} biology, <b>Ornithine</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> antizyme (ODC-AZ) is an <b>ornithine</b> <b>decarboxylase</b> inhibitor.
