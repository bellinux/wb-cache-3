50|$|Ozone cracks form in {{products}} under tension, but the critical strain is very small. The cracks are always oriented {{at right angles}} to the strain axis, so will form around the circumference in a rubber tube bent over. Such cracks are very dangerous when they occur in fuel pipes because the cracks will grow from the outside exposed surfaces into the bore of the pipe, so fuel leakage and fire may follow. Seals are also susceptible to attack, such as diaphragm seals in air lines. Such seals are often critical for the operation of pneumatic controls, and if a crack penetrates the seal, all functions of the system can be lost. Nitrile rubber seals are commonly used in pneumatic systems because of its <b>oil</b> <b>resistance.</b> However, if ozone gas is present, cracking will occur in the seals unless preventative measures are taken.Ozone attack will occur at the most sensitive zones in a seal, especially sharp corners where the strain is greatest when the seal is flexing in use. The corners represent stress concentrations, so the tension is at a maximum when the diaphragm of the seal is bent under air pressure.The seal shown at left failed from traces of ozone at circa 1 ppm, and once cracking had started, it continued as long as the gas was present. This particular failure led to loss of production on a semi-conductor fabrication line. The problem was solved by adding effective filters in the air line and by modifying the design to eliminate the very sharp corners. An ozone-resistant elastomer such as Viton was also considered as a replacement for the Nitrile rubber. The pictures were taken using ESEM for maximum resolution.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Natural rubber (NR) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} agriculture products of Thailand, which is an important material with unique and special characteristics used in wide range of applications such as mechanical properties, excellent strength, and elasticity. However, it is inferior in <b>oil</b> <b>resistance</b> due to the presence of hydrogen and carbon in its structure. This inherent drawback of NR has limited its application in industry. In order to expand the use of NR, this research is interested to improve the <b>oil</b> <b>resistance</b> of NR without loss of outstanding properties by grafting NR with acrylonitrile (AN) monomer to form the nano-matrix structure. The influences of the initial monomer concentration and initial initiator concentration were investigated. These effects on structure, mechanical properties and <b>oil</b> <b>resistance</b> properties were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, tensile machine, and swelling in toluene, respectively.

40|$|The convertability and barrier {{properties}} of paperboard coated with hydroxypropyl-cellulose (HPC) based dispersions were studied via tray pressing trials, <b>oil</b> <b>resistance</b> measurements and microscopic analyses. To improve the <b>oil</b> <b>resistance</b> of the HPC-based coatings and {{to maximize their}} convertability, talc, gelatin and latex were used as additives in coating formulations. The <b>oil</b> <b>resistance</b> of the coatings improved to some extent with these additives, but scanning electron micrographs revealed the existence of pinholes particularly in coatings with a high HPC content. The coated paperboard samples were pressed into rectangular trays and the convertability of the paperboards was evaluated with a microscope. Thereafter, the <b>oil</b> <b>resistance</b> of the trays was determined in order to clarify how the tray pressing process affected the <b>oil</b> <b>resistance.</b> Pure HPC coating did not provide appreciable <b>oil</b> <b>resistance</b> to the paperboard, but the composite coatings resisted oil up to 11 minutes at the tray corners, which were considered the most demanding regions in the tray. The pure HPC coating was sticky and tended {{to stick to the}} converting tools in the press forming. Adding talc to the coating dispersion reduced this problem. By applying a thin pre-coating layer, it was possible to raise the blank holding force in the pressing process from 1. 16 kN to 1. 55 kN without causing rupture in the tray corner areas or compromising the quality of the creases. With commercial polyethylene-terephthalate-coated reference paperboard, the use of such a high force resulted in long rupture and opened creases, which confirms the excellent applicability of the developed dispersion-coating recipes for the tray-pressing process. These observations suggest that convertibility is not necessarily a major problem with bio-based dispersion barrier coatings and that more attention should be paid to their {{barrier properties}} and particularly to the prevention of pinholes being formed during the coating process...|$|E

Five rubbers are investigated: acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR), hydrogenated acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (HNBR), epoxidized natural rubber (ENR), polyacrylic elastomer (ACM) and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA). Furthermore, polypropylene as a non-oil resistant material and polyamide as an oil resistant thermoplastic compound are investigated. There exist chances according to the industrial development of oil resistant thermoplastic compounds using the combination of polyamide with ACM, HNBR, NBR and EVA and using the combination of polypropylene with HNBR and NBR. By increasing the polarity, cross-linking density of the rubber {{and the content of}} thermoplastics, the <b>oil</b> <b>resistance</b> and fuel resistance of the thermoplastics increase. Furthermore, the hardness and tensile strength increase as a function of content of thermoplastics and cross-linking density.

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{describes}} {{the preparation of}} lignin filled natural rubber latex composite and its subsequent use to obtain lignin modified rubber. Two types of lignin i. e. : rubber wood and commercial alkali lignin were used as rubber filler. Gum rubber sheets were prepared from the lignin modified rubber and their properties were compared to Standard Malaysian Rubber (SMR 20) and a type of rubber obtained from the coagulation of high ammonia latex. Rubber morphology was investigated using Scanning Electron Microscope on the cross-sectional area of cryo-fractured samples. <b>Oil</b> <b>resistance</b> of the rubber sheets was determined by measuring the mass change before and after ASTM IRM 903 oil immersion, while the tensile strengths were determined according to ASTM D 412 standard. Low values of tensile strength obtained for the commercial alkali lignin modified rubber sheet relative {{to the rest of}} the rubber samples was attributed to poor lignin dispersion. This occurrence was substantiated by the SEM analysis of cryo-fractured samples where crazes and inhomogeneity was observed. Nonetheless, both lignin modified rubbers exhibited higher level of <b>oil</b> <b>resistance</b> compared to SMR 20. This is due to the nature of lignin as a hydrophilic component and its presence in the rubber matrix complicates the oil diffusion process into rubber. ...|$|E
