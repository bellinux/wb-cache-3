However, to date there are no studies in humans directly testing the organizational effects of FT on structural brain development. In the current study we investigated the effects of FT on corpus callosum size and asymmetry. High-resolution structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the brain were obtained on 28 8 - 11 -year-old boys whose exposure to FT had been previously measured in utero via amniocentesis conducted during the second trimester. Although there was no relationship between FT and midsaggital corpus callosum size, increasing FT {{was significantly related to}} increasing rightward asymmetry (e. g., Right > Left) of a posterior subsection of the callosum, the isthmus, that projects mainly to parietal and superior temporal areas. This potential <b>organizational</b> <b>effect</b> of FT on rightward callosal asymmetry may be working through enhancing the neuroprotective effects of FT and result in an asymmetric distribution of callosal axons. We suggest that this possible <b>organizational</b> <b>effect</b> of FT on callosal asymmetry may also play a role in shaping sexual dimorphism in functional and structural brain development, cognition, and behavior...|$|E

40|$|Background: Exposure to androgens {{early in}} development, while {{activating}} adaptive aggressive behavior, may also exert long-lasting effects on non-target components of phenotype. Here we compare these <b>organizational</b> <b>effects</b> of perinatal androgens in closely related Nazca (Sula granti) and blue-footed (S. nebouxii) boobies that differ in neonatal social system. The older of two Nazca booby hatchlings unconditionally attacks and ejects the younger from the nest {{within days of}} hatching, while blue-footed booby neonates lack lethal aggression. Both Nazca booby chicks facultatively upregulate testosterone (T) during fights, motivating the prediction that baseline androgen levels differ between obligately siblicidal and other species. Methodology/Principal Findings: We show that obligately siblicidal Nazca boobies hatch with higher circulating androgen levels than do facultatively siblicidal blue-footed boobies, providing comparative evidence {{of the role of}} androgens in sociality. Although androgens confer a short-term benefit of increased aggression to Nazca booby neonates, exposure to elevated androgen levels during this sensitive period in development can also induce long-term <b>organizational</b> <b>effects</b> on behavior or morphology.

40|$|Background The {{biological}} {{basis for}} {{sex differences in}} brain function and disease susceptibility is poorly understood. Examining the role of gonadal hormones in brain sexual differentiation may provide important information about sex differences in neural health and development. Permanent masculinization of brain structure, function, and disease is induced by testosterone prenatally in males, but the possible mediation of these effects by long-term changes in the epigenome is poorly understood. Methods We investigated the <b>organizational</b> <b>effects</b> of testosterone on the DNA methylome and transcriptome in two sexually dimorphic forebrain regions—the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis/preoptic area and the striatum. To study the contribution of testosterone to both the establishment and persistence of sex differences in DNA methylation, we performed genome-wide surveys in male, female, and female mice given testosterone {{on the day of}} birth. Methylation was assessed during the perinatal window for testosterone 2 ̆ 7 s <b>organizational</b> <b>effects</b> and in adulthood. Results The short-term effect of testosterone exposure was relatively modest. However, in adult animals the number of genes whose methylation was altered had increased by 20 -fold. Furthermore, we found that in adulthood, methylation at a substantial number of sexually dimorphic CpG sites was masculinized in response to neonatal testosterone exposure. Consistent with this, testosterone 2 ̆ 7 s effect on gene expression in the striatum was more apparent in adulthood. Conclusion Taken together, our data imply that the <b>organizational</b> <b>effects</b> of testosterone on the brain methylome and transcriptome are dramatic and late-emerging.

A multistage, diagnostic procedure was utilized to identify 113 children with ADHD and 137 non-ADHD comparison children. Right-hand digit ratios showed significant mean differences by gender, as well as associations with ADHD diagnosis. Boys with ADHD had more masculinized digit ratios than control-group boys. More masculine right 2 D: 4 D and 3 D: 4 D ratios were correlated with parent- and teacher-rated inattentive and hyperactive–impulsive symptoms in boys but not in girls.

Since plasma carotenoid levels at adulthood are known to influence testis size and yolk carotenoid levels influence the ability to extract carotenoids later in life, we hypothesized that maternally transmitted carotenoids might influence gonad size at adulthood. Here, we showed that male Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) originating from a carotenoid-enriched egg had smaller testes than control individuals at adulthood. This result shows that yolk carotenoids have long-term <b>organizational</b> <b>effects.</b> In addition, given that carotenoid intake at sexual maturity increases sperm quality and that a decreased testis size is associated with a lower sperm production, we propose that carotenoid exposure during embryo development might influence a trade-off between ejaculate size and sperm quality...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring {{perinatal}} life, sex steroids, such as estradiol, {{have marked}} {{effects on the}} development and function of the nervous system. Environmental estrogens or xenoestrogens are man-made chemicals, which animal and human population encounter in the environment and which are able to disrupt {{the functioning of the}} endocrine system. Scientific interest in the effects of exposure to xenoestrogens has focused more on fertility and reproductive behaviors, while the effects on cognitive behaviors have received less attention. Therefore, the present study explored whether the organochlorine insecticide Methoxychlor (MXC), with known xenoestrogens properties, administered during the perinatal period (from gestational day 11 to postnatal day 8) to pregnant-lactating females, at an environmentally relevant dose (20 µg/kg (body weight) /day), would also affect learning and memory functions depending on the hippocampus of male and female offspring mice in adulthood. When tested in adulthood, MXC perinatal exposure led to an increase in anxiety-like behavior and in short-term spatial working memory in both sexes. Emotional learning was also assessed using a contextual fear paradigm and MXC treated male and female mice showed an enhanced freezing behavior compared to controls. These results were correlated with an increased survival of adult generated cells in the adult hippocampus. In conclusion, our results show that perinatal exposure to an environmentally relevant dose of MXC has an <b>organizational</b> <b>effect</b> on hippocampus-dependent memory and emotional behaviors...|$|E
40|$|In higher vertebrates, {{estrogen}} can exert an <b>organizational</b> <b>effect</b> on sexually dimorphic {{areas of}} {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) during the perinatal phase of development. The possibility that estrogenic pollutants may mimic estrogen action on the CNS during development and produce long-lasting or irreversible effects is an issue of great concern. Bisphenol A (BPA), a compound widely used in the food industry and in dentistry, has proven estrogenic actions. To study its potential developmental effects on behavior, we gave female Sprague-Dawley rats 40 µg/kg/day BPA from conception to weaning postnatal day 21 and 400 µg/kg/day BPA from gestation day 14 to postnatal day 6. After exposure, we studied social behavior in a play situation in juvenile male and female offspring. The attempt to use play behavior to study the effects of BPA yielded some interesting results. We observed an early action of BPA on several behavioral categories in both males and females. In particular we observed a masculinization of female behavior in two behavioral categories (play with females and sociosexual exploration), an effect probably mediated by the estrogenic activity of BPA in the CNS. These long-lasting effects of BPA could have important consequences at individual and population levels.

This study further examines the possibility that prenatal hormones - as measured via 2 D: 4 D finger length ratio - may influence the development of certain personality characteristics associated with sensation seeking (Austin, Manning, McInroy, & Mathews, 2002). We studied the relationship between 2 D: 4 D ratios, a supposed proxy for prenatal testosterone (T), and sensation seeking as assessed by the Sensation Seeking Scale Form V (SSS-V) in a sample of 278 German and UK University students. There were significant sex differences for 2 D: 4 D and on the SSS-V, with males having lower 2 D: 4 D ratios, but higher SSS-V scores. Furthermore, right- and left-hand 2 D: 4 D in males was significantly negatively associated with total sensation seeking score, and the boredom subscale. No significant associations were found for women.

40|$|Abstract: Many {{chemicals}} {{introduced into}} the environment by humans adversely affect embryonic development and {{the functioning of the}} vertebrate reproductive system. It has been hypothesized that many developmental alterations are due to the endocrine-disruptive effects of various environmental contaminants. The endocrine system exhibits an <b>organizational</b> <b>effect</b> on the developing embryo, altering gene expression and dosing. Thus, a disruption of the normal hormonal signals can permanently modify the organization and future functioning of the reproductive and endocrine system. We have worked extensively with contaminant-exposed and reference populations of the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) as well as performed a number of experimental studies exposing developing embryos to various persistent and nonpersistent pesticides. Using this species, we have described altered steroidogenesis, circulating hormone levels, and hepatic transformation of androgen and endocrine organ (gonad, thyroid) morphology in juvenile alligators living in polluted environments. Given the adverse observations reported to date, we recommend several important future needs: 1. Further development of “receptor zoos ” and other molecular tools that include key reptiles from various major ecosystems, in addition to freshwater ecosystems. 2. Global studies extending the current knowledge base on crocodilians and freshwater turtles to comparable ecosystems on other continents, such as linked studies examining and extending current molecular to population-level studies in Florida (USA) to tropical and temperate regions of Africa, Australia, and South America. 3.
