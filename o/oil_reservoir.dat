40|$|Air {{injection}} {{in light}} <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs</b> has received considerable attention as an effective, {{improved oil recovery}} process, based primarily {{on the success of}} several projects within the Williston Basin in the United States. The main mechanism of air injection is the oxidation behavior between oxygen and crude <b>oil</b> in the <b>reservoir.</b> Air injection is a good option because of its wide availability and low cost. Whether air injection can be applied to shale is an interesting topic from both economic and technical perspectives. This paper initiates a comprehensive discussion on the feasibility and potential of air injection in shale <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs</b> based on state-of-the-art literature review. Favorable and unfavorable effects of using air injection are discussed in an analogy analysis on geology, reservoir features, temperature, pressure, and petrophysical, mineral and crude oil properties of shale <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> The available data comparison of the historically successful air injection projects with typical shale <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in the U. S. is summarized in this paper. Some operation methods to improve air injection performance are recommended. This paper provides an avenue for us to make use of many of the favorable conditions of shale <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs</b> for implementing air injection, or air huff ‘n’ puff injection, and the low cost of air has the potential to improve oil recovery in shale <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> This analysis may stimulate further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The nitrate-reducing {{microbial}} community in <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs</b> was examined by PCR using primers to amplify {{a segment of}} napA gene encoding for a subunit of the nitrate reductase, {{and the effects of}} different organic carbon additions on the nitrate-reducing community were also evaluated. The orders Rhodocyclales and Burkholderiales within Betaproteobacteria and Pseudomonadales within Gammaproteobacteria were recovered in production water of all three <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Amendment of organic acids promoted Enterobacteriales within Gammaproteobacteria and orders of Rhodocyclales, Pseudomonadales, and Burkholderiales, while alkanes favored the Rhizobiaceae family within Alphaproteobacteria and orders of Rhodocyclales and Pseudomonadales. Results indicated that the functional gene napA {{can be used as a}} valuable biomarker in analyzing the diversity of nitrate reducers in <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Nitrate-reducing {{microbial community}} shifts following the available carbon sources.

50|$|Withdrawal {{of large}} volumes of oil from the poorly {{consolidated}} sediments resulted in compaction of the <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> and resultant sinking of the overlying land surface. Subsidence became apparent in 1940, and exceeded 20 feet at the center. Water injection to maintain pressure in the <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs</b> began in 1953, which eventually stopped further subsidence.|$|R
25|$|In its strictest sense, {{petroleum}} includes only crude oil, but {{in common}} usage it includes all liquid, gaseous and solid hydrocarbons. Under surface pressure and temperature conditions, lighter hydrocarbons methane, ethane, {{propane and butane}} occur as gases, while pentane and heavier hydrocarbons are {{in the form of}} liquids or solids. However, in an underground <b>oil</b> <b>reservoir</b> the proportions of gas, liquid, and solid depend on subsurface conditions and on the phase diagram of the petroleum mixture.|$|E
25|$|Dyna-frame {{motorcycles}} {{were developed}} in the 1980s and early 1990s and debuted in the 1991 model year with the FXDB Sturgis offered in limited edition quantities. In 1992 the line continued with the limited edition FXDB Daytona and a production model FXD Super Glide. The new DYNA frame featured big-twin engines and traditional styling. They can be distinguished from the Softail by the traditional coil-over suspension that connects the swingarm to the frame, and from the Sportster by their larger engines. On these models, the transmission also houses the engine's <b>oil</b> <b>reservoir.</b>|$|E
25|$|The steam {{produced}} is then fed {{directly to}} the field’s existing steam distribution network, where the steam is continuously injected deep into the <b>oil</b> <b>reservoir.</b> Sheltering the mirrors from the wind allows them to achieve higher temperature rates and prevents dust from building up as a result from exposure to humidity. GlassPoint Solar, the company that created the Enclosed Trough design, states its technology can produce heat for EOR for about $5 per million British thermal units in sunny regions, compared to between $10 and $12 for other conventional solar thermal technologies.|$|E

50|$|Microbial Enhanced Oil Recovery (MEOR) is a {{biological}} based technology consisting in manipulating function or structure, or both, of microbial environments existing in <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> The ultimate aim of MEOR {{is to improve}} the recovery of oil entrapped in porous media while increasing economic profits. MEOR is a tertiary oil extraction technology allowing the partial recovery of the commonly residual two-thirds of oil, thus increasing the life of mature <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs.</b>|$|R
30|$|There are {{generally}} two solutions {{to determine the}} relative permeability curve. One is the experimental solution {{and the other one}} is the analytical solution. Due to the low permeability in tight <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> the displacement pressure is high and the flow rate is low in relative permeability experiments. As a result, the experimental solution is time consuming and difficult to be conducted. The analytical solution, however, has several advantages. First, because the analytical solution is based on the capillary pressure data and mercury injection experiments are widely used in tight <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> it has abundant basic data. Second, it can reflect the effect of the micropore–throat structure on relative permeability. The most important advantage is, it is easy to obtain the relative permeability. Therefore, many scholars focus on the analytical solution and have got many achievements. Although in tight <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs</b> boundary layer is up to 60  % (Li et al. 2011) of the throat, and pore-to-throat ratio reaches up to 400 (Li et al. 2012), no existing solutions take them into account. Therefore, existing solutions are not suitable for tight <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs.</b>|$|R
25|$|The total {{estimated}} {{amount of oil}} in an <b>oil</b> <b>reservoir,</b> including both producible and non-producible oil, is called oil in place. However, because of reservoir characteristics and limitations in petroleum extraction technologies, {{only a fraction of}} this oil can be brought to the surface, and it is only this producible fraction that is considered to be reserves. The ratio of reserves to the total amount of oil in a particular reservoir is called the recovery factor. Determining a recovery factor for a given field depends on several features of the operation, including method of oil recovery used and technological developments.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of January 10, 1901, Anthony F. Lucas, an {{experienced}} mining engineer, drilled the first major oil well at Spindletop, the little hill south of Beaumont, Texas. The East Texas Oil Field, discovered on October 5, 1930, is located in east {{central part of the}} state, and is the largest and most prolific <b>oil</b> <b>reservoir</b> in the contiguous United States. Other oil fields were later discovered in West Texas and under the Gulf of Mexico. The resulting Texas Oil Boom permanently transformed the economy of Texas, and led to its most significant economic expansion after the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The Beaver was {{designed}} for flight in rugged and remote areas of the world. Its STOL capability made it ideal for areas normally only accessible by canoe or foot. Because the aircraft often flies to remote locations and in cold climates, its <b>oil</b> <b>reservoir</b> filler {{is located in the}} cockpit and oil can be filled in flight. A series of upgrades to the basic design were incorporated. One major customer introduced the use of flat steps replacing the earlier tubes, a feature now almost universal. In 1987, the Canadian Engineering Centennial Board named the DHC-2 {{as one of the top}} ten Canadian engineering achievements of the 20th century.|$|E
30|$|With the {{increasing}} demands for energy {{resources and the}} declining of oil resources, more and more attentions are paid to the exploration and development of heavy <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Due to high density and viscosity as well as poor mobility of heavy oils, {{it is difficult to}} have recovery rate with conventional development methods (Guo and Su 2013; Bera and Babadagli 2015). Thermal recovery methods need {{to be used in the}} production to improve the recovery efficiency of heavy <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> At present, steam stimulation is an effective thermal recovery method for heavy oils (Hamedi Shokrlu and Babadagli 2014). In steam stimulation, the oil field is produced by depleted development after the end of shut in well. The value of reservoir compression coefficient is significant for the improvement in heavy oil recovery. Compression coefficient is an important parameter which reflects the elastic energy can be provided by reservoir rocks, and high rock compressibility indicates sufficient elastic driving energy of <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs</b> with which <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs</b> can be easily exploited.|$|R
40|$|Subsurface <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs</b> {{are complex}} {{ecosystems}} comprising physiological diverse indigenous microbial communities. Those populations {{have been the}} subject of intense investigation in recent years. Their study and characterization is of great relevance to understanding the activities and roles of indigenous microorganisms in <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> as well as the genesis and transformations of petroleum hydrocarbons. Furthermore, their study can contribute to predict or avoid detrimental effects caused by deleterious microorganisms as well as to promote the development of new and innovative technologies to enhance oil productivity and recovery efficiency from poorly performing and depleted oil fields. As microorganisms inhabiting <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are adapted to extreme environmental conditions, they usually harbor enzymes or metabolic functions that might be of great interest for scientific and industrial applications. The current knowledge of the microbial ecology of oil fields, however, is still largely insufficient and further studies are required. This review provides a microbiological perspective of <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> focused on the application of microorganisms to increase oil recovery from mature reservoirs as an alternative to the traditional chemical-enhanced oil-recovery methods...|$|R

500|$|After the race, NASCAR {{announced}} it {{had found a}} problem with the lid on the <b>oil</b> <b>reservoir</b> encasement during a post-race inspection on Edwards' car, which was later taken to the NASCAR Research and Development Center in Concord, North Carolina, for further analysis. Three days after the race, Roush Fenway Racing was given penalties for [...] "actions detrimental to stock car racing", [...] "car, car parts, components and/or equipment used do not conform to NASCAR rules", and a device or duct work that permitted air to pass through the car from one area of the interior of the car to another, or to the outside of the car. The penalties included a $100,000 fine and a six-race suspension for Edwards' crew chief Bob Osborne, who was suspended from NASCAR until April 30, 2008, and placed on probation until December 31, 2008. Roush Fenway Racing chief engineer Chris Andrews took over Osborne's role at the next race weekend. Edwards and car owner Jack Roush incurred the loss of 100 driver and owner points. In the event that Edwards qualified for the Chase for the Sprint Cup, he would not receive ten bonus points awarded to him for winning the race which was used to determine the seeding order. Edwards was allowed to keep the victory; he moved from first to seventh in the Drivers' Championship. On March 12, Roush Fenway Racing {{announced it}} would not appeal the penalties.|$|E

40|$|The Depletion of oil {{production}} and the low recovery rate are major challenges faced in {{oil production}} at Norwegian continental self. Several {{studies have shown that}} considerable amount of oil still remains after the well shutdown. Heavy <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs</b> occupy more than two third of globally oil reserves. Therefore, extensive studies are undergone to optimize the oil recovery in heavy <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Water flooding and Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods are successfully implemented. Water breakthrough strongly affects on the recovery factor in heavily <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs</b> and water cut is exponentially increased after the breakthrough. Inflow Control Devices (ICDs) are becoming handy in controlling water cut of the inflow. The water coning effect of the reservoir is also reduced by ICDS. Water coning depends on reservoir properties and recovery techniques. Hence, a better understanding about them are needed to observe and develop oil production. Literature review is provided useful information over and affecting factors of water breakthrough in heavy <b>oil</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Moreover, the <b>oil</b> production is needed to be optimized within the handling capacity of offshore platforms. ICDs are used to control the multiphase flow behavior in production flow. Furthermore, multiphase flow behavior can be used to describe most of the characteristics in <b>oil</b> production.

2500|$|Enormous {{waste of}} natural gas was a dubious {{distinction}} that Turner Valley claimed for many years. [...] Royalite had a monopoly on sales to Canadian Western Natural Gas Company, so other producers could not sell their gas. [...] But all the producers wanted {{to cash in on}} the natural gas liquids for which markets were growing. [...] So the common practice became to pass the gas through separators, then flare it off. [...] This greatly reduced the pressure on the <b>oil</b> <b>reservoir,</b> reducing the amount of recoverable oil. [...] But the size of the problem was not clear until the oil column was later discovered.|$|E
2500|$|Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) is an {{enhanced}} oil recovery technology for producing {{heavy crude oil}} and bitumen. It is an advanced form of steam stimulation in which a pair of horizontal wells are drilled into the <b>oil</b> <b>reservoir,</b> one a few metres above the other. High pressure steam is continuously injected into the upper wellbore to heat the oil and reduce its viscosity, causing the heated oil to drain into the lower wellbore, where it is pumped out to a bitumen recovery facility. Dr. Roger Butler, engineer at Imperial Oil from 1955 to 1982, invented steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) in the 1970s. Butler [...] "developed the concept of using horizontal pairs of wells and injected steam to develop certain deposits of bitumen considered too deep for mining." ...|$|E

In the late 1960s, more exploratory oil wells were drilled near Wreck Island in the Capricorn Channel, and near Darnley Island in the Torres Strait, but with no results. In the 1970s, responding to concern about oil spills, the Australian government forbade petroleum drilling on the GBR.

2500|$|In 1910, King's Pacific Sunset Oil Company, {{which he}} re-named and {{incorporated}} the Boston Pacific Oil Company in March 2010 (see below), brought a suit before United States circuit court on 23 December for an injunction to restrain Charles W. Gregg of Colorado, U.S. Waugh, W. Newburg, Morris Newberger, F.A. Cromwell, C.M. Webb, Adeline Webb, U.E. Methaver, {{and several other}} of Gregg's associates living in California from disposing of 200,000 shares of the oil company's stock, valued at $1 a share at the time, which, it was alleged, was secured by the defendants through [...] "trickery and fraud." [...] Gregg and the other defendants held 200,000 shares of the 219,965 shares of the issued capital stock of the Pacific Sunset oil company. [...] It is said {{that in order to}} trade off the 200,000 shares of the Pacific Sunset stock for an equal amount in the Boston Pacific company, Gregg and the other defendants, among other things, filled an <b>oil</b> <b>reservoir</b> on the Pacific Sunset oil company's fifty acres of leased land in Kern county, which contained 3,400 barrels of oil, with water so as to make it appear that the reservoir held between 25,000 to 30,000 barrels of oil. [...] When negotiations began, Gregg and his associates asserted there were four wells on the property each of which was producing 70 barrels of oil per day; and that the total liabilities of the Pacific Sunset Oil Company, which it was proposed that BPOC should take over, did not exceed $10,000; that the sump contained between 25,000 and 30,000 barrels of oil and that the company had an option to purchase the leased land for $80,000 ($2 million in 2016). The complaint stated that each of the four wells produced only 17 to 20 barrels of actual oil the day of the investigation when inspected by a representative of Fillius, and that the wells had not been worked for some period previous to the time they were inspected, so that the 70 barrels pumped [...] "the day of" [...] the investigation was actually the accumulation of several days of pumping; that the sump contained only 3,600 barrels of oil, not 25,000-30,000 (the remainder of the fluid in the reserves being water poured in by the defendants); and that the company held no option to purchase the land they had leased for $80,000. [...] The complaint also indicated that the liabilities of the Pacific Sun Oil Company amounted to $23,304. Another charge contained in the complaint was the Gregg said the Pacific Sunset company had an agreement with the Independent Oil Producers' agency whereby the latter agreed to take all the oil the former should sell at $0.55 ($13.50 in 2016) a barrel, whereas no such agreement existed.|$|E
