5|$|After 13,000 {{years the}} Grand Galactics finally return to Earth and are astounded {{to see how}} fast the planet has developed. They had always {{interfered}} with the evolution of sentient species they had discovered, believing {{they could not be}} trusted to evolve on their own. Impressed with Earth's progress, the Grand Galactic relieve themselves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of watching over intelligent life and hand the task over to Earth.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} with the {{friendly}} Ascanio Piccolomini (the Archbishop of Siena), Galileo {{was allowed to}} return to his villa at Arcetri near Florence in 1634, where he spent the remainder of his life under house arrest. Galileo was ordered to read the seven penitential psalms once a week for the next three years. However, his daughter Maria Celeste relieved him <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> after securing ecclesiastical permission to take it upon herself.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, from July to October 1940, the Spitfire was {{perceived}} by the public {{to be the main}} RAF fighter, though the more numerous Hawker Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> against Nazi Germany's air force, the Luftwaffe. Spitfire units, however, had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of its higher performance. During the Battle, Spitfires in general were tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fightersmainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E series aircraft which were a close match for them.|$|E

5|$|The {{operating}} nightmares of the tunnel, not {{to mention}} the millions of dollars the CGW spent to keep it open, forced the railroad's management to consider many schemes to rid themselves <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden.</b> In 1909, 1951 and again in 1964 (the same year the North Western and Great Western announced their intentions to merge) the CGW sought engineering proposals to reroute their trackage around the bore, to daylight the tunnel, or to completely rebuild and improve it. To the often cash-strapped Great Western, however, all these plans proved far too expensive.|$|E
5|$|It was {{immediately}} {{agreed that the}} 1941 season of Proms should {{be held at the}} Albert Hall. It was twice the size of the Queen's Hall, with poor acoustics, but a six-week series was judged a success, and the Albert Hall remained the home of the Proms. Wood, aged seventy-two, was persuaded to have an associate conductor to relieve him of some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden.</b> Basil Cameron undertook the task and remained a Prom conductor until his retirement, aged eighty, in 1964. The BBC brought its symphony orchestra back to London and resumed its backing of the Proms in 1942; Boult joined Cameron as Wood's associate conductor during that season. In early 1943, Wood's health deteriorated, and two days after the start of that year's season, he collapsed and was ordered to have a month in bed. Despite wartime vicissitudes, the 1943 season sold nearly 250,000 tickets, with an average audience of about 4,000 – many more than could have fitted into the Queen's Hall.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{retained}} {{his interest}} in western affairs, hoping in vain to salvage the Ohio Company's land grant. He and Jefferson were among the few delegates to be told of George Rogers Clark's expedition to secure control of the lands north of the Ohio River. Mason and Jefferson secured legislation authorizing Governor Henry to defend against unspecified western enemies. The expedition was generally successful, and Mason received a report directly from Clark. Mason sought to remove differences between Virginia and other states, and although he felt the 1780 settlement of the boundary dispute with Pennsylvania, the Mason-Dixon line (not named for George Mason) was unfavorable to Virginia, he voted for it enthusiastically. Also in 1780, Mason remarried, to Sarah Brent, from a nearby plantation, {{who had never been}} married and was 52 years old. It was a marriage of convenience, with the new bride able to take some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of parenting Mason's many children off his hands.|$|E

5|$|James {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent at 12:01am EDT on July 1, 2010. During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers. On July 8, he announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision {{that he would}} sign with the Heat. The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities. The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade had also announced that they would sign with Miami; reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies. James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part {{so that he could}} shoulder less of the offensive load; he thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland. Heat president Pat Riley {{played a major role in}} selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade. James would be relieved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the comparison and development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax <b>burden</b> on labor costs in the European Union countries, with subsequent evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tax <b>burden</b> on income <b>of</b> individuals in <b>the</b> Czech Republic, especially in the years 2005 - 2013.

25|$|The {{higher costs}} to labour and capital imposed by income tax causes {{deadweight}} loss in an economy, being {{the loss of}} economic activity from people deciding not to invest capital or use time productively because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> that tax would impose on those activities. There is also a loss from individuals and professional advisors devoting time to tax-avoiding behaviour instead of economically-productive activities.|$|E

25|$|In case {{of balance}} of {{payments}} imbalances, Keynes recommended that both debtors and creditors should change their policies. As outlined by Keynes, countries with payment surpluses should increase their imports from the deficit countries, build factories in debtor nations, or donate to them—and thereby create a foreign trade equilibrium. Thus, Keynes was sensitive to the problem that placing too much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>burden</b> on the deficit country would be deflationary.|$|E
