50|$|There are {{a couple}} of {{interesting}} phenomena arising from the two types of statistics. The Bose-Einstein distribution which describes bosons leads to Bose-Einstein condensation. Below a certain temperature, most of the particles in a bosonic system will <b>occupy</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> (<b>the</b> state of lowest energy). Unusual properties such as superfluidity can result. The Fermi-Dirac distribution describing fermions also leads to interesting properties. Since only one fermion can occupy a given quantum state, the lowest single-particle energy level for spin-1/2 fermions contains at most two particles, with the spins of the particles oppositely aligned. Thus, even at absolute zero, the system still has a significant amount of energy. As a result, a fermionic system exerts an outward pressure. Even at non-zero temperatures, such a pressure can exist. This degeneracy pressure is responsible for keeping certain massive stars from collapsing due to gravity. See white dwarf, neutron star, and black hole.|$|R

40|$|A Bose-Einstein {{condensate}} is a {{state of}} matter where bosonic particles macroscopically <b>occupy</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> of a system. It was predicted as early as 1924 by Satyendra Nath Bose & Albert Einstein. Although this state of matter was deemed possible, it was only experimentally achieved relatively recently. In 1995 by Eric Cornell, Carl Wieman & Wolfgang Ketterle. This Bose-Einstein condensate was made using massive bosonic particles. But all bosons should be able to under go Bose-Einstein condensation so why not the most common one of them all, the photon? This question was mostly waved away with a quick reference to the fact that photons adhere to Planck's law. For Bose-Einstein condensation one should be able to tune the temperature and particle number independently. It was thus thought that photons could not be made to condense. This all changed when Martin Weitz showed that he could tune both the temperature and particle number of photons independently by confining them to a white-wall box filled with a medium. In 2010 they became the first group to achieve a Bose-Einstein condensate of photons. They used an optical dye filled microcavity to make a two-dimensional photon gas Bose-Einstein condense. In 2015 we became the second group in the world to replicate these results. One of the characteristics of a photon Bose-Einstein condensate that has not yet been researched is its polarization. As Bose-Einstein condensation is an example of spontaneous symmetry breaking. One could expect each condensate to pick a well defined but random polarization. However, slight anisotropy could also force each condensate to pick the same polarization. To answer these questions we build an experimental setup which can measure all four Stokes parameters at the same time. We find that the polarization of every condensate was the same. The polarization of the condensate shows a clear distinction from the polarization of the thermal cloud. We find that the thermal cloud is unpolarized while the condensate is a superposition of multiple polarization states with a strong linear contribution...|$|R
40|$|Exciton-polaritons are half-light half-matter bosonic quasiparticles {{formed by}} the strong {{coupling}} between quantum well excitons and the photonic mode of a planar semiconductor microcavity. By increasing the polariton population above a threshold density, polaritons can macroscopically <b>occupy</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> of <b>the</b> dispersion and form a non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate. This thesis addresses some of the fundamental concepts studied in polariton microcavities, such as dark solitons, polariton spin textures and condensation, by concentrating on the linear and nonlinear nature of these effects. In the first part, the formation of dark solitons is studied by investigating the propagation and scattering of polaritons in a planar microcavity in the linear regime. The propagation of the polariton wave across an extended defect creates phase and intensity patterns with identical qualitative features previously attributed to dark and half-dark solitons of polaritons. By combining both experimental evidence and theoretical analysis, all the experimental observations supporting the formation of dark solitons in polariton microcavities are questioned. Since they are observed with negligible nonlinearity (i. e., polariton-polariton interaction), they are not sufficient to identify dark and half-dark solitons. A condition based on the healing length of the condensate is proposed as a new criterion to identify dark solitons in polariton microcavities. In the second part, the spin dynamics of polariton condensates is investigated in the non-linear emission regime, by studying the spatial, angular, energy and transient dynamics of the polariton emission. In a radially expanding condensate, polaritons with opposite spin arrange themselves in geometrically ordered spin textures and propagate over hundreds of microns in {{the plane of the}} microcavity. Depending on the polarization of the excitation pump different spin textures are observed. Moreover, a polariton whirl" namely a spin texture that rotates in the plane of the microcavity on picosecond scale is reported for the first time. Finally, the condensation of polaritons in a strain compensated microcavity is investigated. Signatures of polariton condensation, according to the current understanding of polariton condensates, are experimentally observed, including the observation of a second threshold which marks the transition from the strong to the weak-coupling regime. <br/...|$|R

The first experimental demonstration of a dilute gas BEC was performed by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman in 1995 and since then, several dozen groups around the world have achieved and study BECs. This thesis documents design and construction work performed in support of the Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC) experiment at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The objective of the work performed was to upgrade the existing BEC machine in most of its significant subsystems to attain better experimental cycle times and BECs with a larger atom number than what was previously attainable, as well as improve the optical quality of the imaging and laser manipulation beams at the location of the BEC. These objectives were achieved through {{the construction of a new}} laser system with greater power and larger magneto-optical trap (MOT) beam diameters, a new quadrupole magnetic trap with better optical access and higher magnetic field gradients than the Ioffe-Pritchard coil configuration it replaced, and a cuvette-style quartz cell with a much higher optical quality than the hand-blown cell used previously. In addition to these improvements the feasibility of using phase-contrast imaging of the BECs created in this machine for future experimental goals was evaluated and found to be feasible.

40|$|Waves are a {{phenomenon}} {{that can be found}} virtually everywhere in nature. A first description of wave propagation can be given in the linear limit, but the nonlinear regime of propagation is of the utmost importance, also in view of possible applications in several scientific fields. In the course of this work, nonlinear wave propagation in physical systems from plasmas interacting with super-intense laser light to Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) has been investigated, making use of the analogies brought to light by the mathematical modelization of such different systems. In the case of laser-plasma interactions, the main problem is the propagation of electromagnetic waves through a plasma. The nonlinear character is due to the high laser intensity which sets the plasma electrons into relativistic motion and exerts a force strongly perturbing their equilibrium density distribution. This deeply modifies the physics of the propagation leading to effects like self-induced transparency or the generation of plasma-field structures. Self-induced transparency is originated by the relativistic quiver motion of the plasma electrons and allows light to propagate through plasmas with a density so high that light propagation would classically be impossible. We have studied the problem of a threshold for induced transparency via an exact analytical investigation which has led furthermore to an exact description of the structures (electron depletion regions and light filaments) generated in the plasma {{as a consequence of the}} interaction, for both high and low density plasmas. The physics behind the generation of these structures can be described, in the weakly nonlinear limit, by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS), one of the fundamental nonlinear equations of physics. The importance and effectiveness of analytical investigations has been demonstrated by an analysis of the NLS equation generalized to the case of multi-dimensional non conservative systems (Ginzburg-Landau equation) and applied to the description of a scheme for the amplification of laser pulses (the chirped pulse amplification scheme). Furthermore, the same mathematical structure of the NLS equation describes the physics of BEC, systems of bosonic atoms that have undergone a phase transition such that they <b>occupy</b> <b>the</b> same <b>ground</b> <b>state.</b> It is <b>the</b> wave nature of matter which brings to light deep analogies with the nonlinear classical physics of optics and we have made of these analogies a tool for investigating certain aspects of the nature of a condensate.

The classical phase diagram consists of six magnetic phases which all have different orbital ordering: two antiferromagnetic (AF) phases with G-AF order and either x 2 -y 2 or 3 z 2 -r 2 orbitals occupied, two phases with mixed orbital (MO) patterns and A-AF order, and two other MO phases with either C-AF or G-AF order. All of them become degenerate at the multicritical point M=(E_z,J_H) =(0, 0). Using a generalization of linear spin-wave theory we study both the transverse excitations which are spin-waves and spin-and-orbital-waves, {{as well as the}} longitudinal (orbital) excitations. The transverse modes couple to each other, and the spin-and-orbital-wave turns into a soft mode near the M point. Therefore, quantum corrections to the long-range-order parameter are drastically increased near the orbital degeneracy, and classical order is suppressed in a crossover regime between the G-AF and A-AF phases in the (E_z,J_H) plane. This behavior is reminiscent of that found in frustrated spin models, and we conclude that orbital degeneracy provides a new and physically realizable mechanism which stabilizes a spin liquid <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> due to inherent frustration of magnetic interactions.

We show that, if the initial condition is at <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> manifold, bifurcated from <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> of −Δ+V_ 0, then, for any fixed s∈[0, 1], as ε→ 0, the solution will converge to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> manifold bifurcated from <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>state</b> of −Δ+V_s. Moreover, the limit is of the same mass to the initial condition...|$|R
