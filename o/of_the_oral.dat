5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} affects between 5% and 66% of people, {{with about}} 20% {{of individuals in}} most populations having the condition to some degree. This makes it the most common disease <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> mucosa. Aphthous stomatitis occurs worldwide, but {{is more common in}} developed countries.|$|E
5|$|In {{rare cases}} where none <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> {{treatments}} are effective, especially in severe neurological disease, dimercaprol (British anti-Lewisite) is occasionally necessary. This treatment is injected intramuscularly (into a muscle) {{every few weeks}} and has unpleasant side effects such as pain.|$|E
5|$|The {{nutritional}} deficiencies associated with aphthous stomatitis (B12, folate, and iron) can all cause {{a decrease in}} the thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> mucosa (atrophy).|$|E

5|$|Aphthous-like {{ulceration}} {{may occur}} {{in association with}} several systemic disorders (see table). These ulcers are clinically and histopathologically identical to the lesions of aphthous stomatitis, but this type of oral ulceration is {{not considered to be}} true aphthous stomatitis by some sources. Some of these conditions may cause ulceration on other mucosal surfaces in addition to the mouth such as the conjunctiva or the genital mucous membranes. Resolution of the systemic condition often leads to decreased frequency and severity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> ulceration.|$|E
5|$|Aphthous {{stomatitis}} is {{uncommon in}} people who smoke, {{and there is also}} a correlation between habit duration and severity of the condition. Tobacco use is associated with an increase in keratinization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> mucosa. In extreme forms, this may manifest as leukoplakia or stomatitis nicotina (smoker's keratosis). This increased keratinization may mechanically reinforce the mucosa and reduce the tendency of ulcers to form after minor trauma, or present a more substantial barrier to microbes and antigens, but this is unclear. Nicotine is also known to stimulate production of adrenal steroids and reduce production of TNF-α, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6. Smokeless tobacco products also seem to protect against aphthous stomatitis. Cessation of smoking is known to sometimes precede the onset of aphthous stomatitis in people previously unaffected, or exacerbate the condition in those who were already experiencing aphthous ulceration. Despite this correlation, starting smoking again does not usually lessen the condition.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} what the {{function}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> setae in extant species is, other than the long sensory hairs seen in some genera such as Anochetus and Odontomachus. In Zigrasimecia, the similar structures most likely did not act as trigger-hairs because they are stout and shorter. Instead, they were probably used for mechanical interactions with their food. The setae may have allowed the manipulation of liquid food, and the unification of the mandibles with other body parts such as the clypeus and labral indicates that they served as a trap for potential arthropod prey, particularly mites and small flies. Zigrasimecia was possibly a generalist predator.|$|E

5|$|Pyelonephritis {{is treated}} more aggressively {{than a simple}} bladder {{infection}} using either a longer course of oral antibiotics or intravenous antibiotics. Seven days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin is typically used {{in areas where the}} resistance rate is less than 10%. If the local resistance rates are greater than 10%, a dose of intravenous ceftriaxone is often prescribed. Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole or amoxicillin/clavulanate orally for 14 days is another reasonable option. In those who exhibit more severe symptoms, admission to a hospital for ongoing antibiotics may be needed. Complications such as urinary obstruction from a kidney stone may be considered if symptoms do not improve following two or three days of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Richard B. Parkinson and Ludwig D. Morenz {{write that}} ancient Egyptian literature—narrowly defined as belles-lettres ("beautiful writing")—was not {{recorded}} in written form {{until the early}} Twelfth dynasty of the Middle Kingdom. Old Kingdom texts served mainly to maintain the divine cults, preserve souls in the afterlife, and document accounts for practical uses in daily life. It {{was not until the}} Middle Kingdom that texts were written for the purpose of entertainment and intellectual curiosity. Parkinson and Morenz also speculate that written works of the Middle Kingdom were transcriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> literature of the Old Kingdom. It is known that some oral poetry was preserved in later writing; for example, litter-bearers' songs were preserved as written verses in tomb inscriptions of the Old Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|After some time, the king's {{designated}} successor, Andriambonimena, {{launched a}} retaliatory {{attack against the}} prince's half-brother Andrianentoarivo at Ambohipotsy and successfully chased him from his fief. Andriantomponimerina {{recognized the need to}} take more dramatic action to consolidate his grip on power and sent a messenger to the Sakalava king requesting his support. The Sakalava reaffirmed their loyalty to Andriamasinavalona, however, and threatened to attack the prince if the rightful king was not released from his captivity. According to one version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> history, having failed to use the king as a pawn to gain power, the prince decided to ransom his father for 7,000 piastres to increase his personal wealth. Every citizen of Imerina was obligated to contribute, and those who had no money sold their children or themselves into slavery in order to raise the necessary funds. The money was placed in seven baskets and transported by dugout canoe to the prince at Ambohidratrimo, who released the king. According to another version of the story, Prince Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana of Ambohimanga sent two hunters of the Tsimahafotsy clan to free the king by digging an escape passage under the wall of his heavily guarded enclosure. After returning to Antananarivo, Andriamasinavalona sent a messenger who announced that the king had decided to hand power to Andriantomponimerina and invited the prince to the capital to be enthroned. The prince hurried to the palace, and throughout the city he was greeted with cheers, singing and dancing. When Andriamasinavalona received him, however, he publicly condemned the prince and stripped him of his rank and power.|$|E

5|$|On {{the first}} day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> {{examinations}} in May 1943, Bloeme's non-Jewish boyfriend warned her that the Germans were looking for her. She asked the school board to administer all 12 of her examinations at once, and she received her high school diploma that same day. When the Germans arrived, they took her to an assembly point for Amsterdam Jews, but she managed to enter the building without being registered. A few days later, she sneaked out {{with a group of}} younger teens. At first she hid in the home of Christian friends of her parents who worked in the Dutch underground, but they were afraid that if they were arrested, Bloeme would be, too. She spent the next year hiding in 15 to 16 different places, including an Amsterdam old-age home and a job as a maid for a widow and her son in Rotterdam. When she returned to the people who worked in the underground, she was arrested and sent to Westerbork.|$|E
5|$|Starfish are marine invertebrates. They {{typically}} have a central disc and five arms, though some species {{have a larger}} number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange, while others are blue, grey or brown. Starfish have tube feet operated by a hydraulic system and a mouth at the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> or lower surface. They are opportunistic feeders and are mostly predators on benthic invertebrates. Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and suspension feeding. They have complex life cycles and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Most can regenerate damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a means of defence. The Asteroidea occupy several significant ecological roles. Starfish, such as the ochre sea star (Pisaster ochraceus) and the reef sea star (Stichaster australis), have become widely known as examples of the keystone species concept in ecology. The tropical crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) is a voracious predator of coral throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and the northern Pacific sea star is considered {{to be one of the}} world's 100 worst invasive species.|$|E
5|$|Stony corals {{are members}} of the class Anthozoa and like other members of the group, do not have a medusa stage in their life cycle. The {{individual}} animals are known as polyps and have a cylindrical body crowned by an oral disc surrounded by a ring of tentacles. The base of the polyp secretes the stony material from which the coral skeleton is formed. The body wall of the polyp consists of mesoglea sandwiched between two layers of epidermis. The mouth is at the centre <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> disc and leads into a tubular pharynx which descends for some distance into the body before opening into the gastrovascular cavity that fills the interior of the body and tentacles. Unlike other cnidarians however, the cavity is subdivided by a number of radiating partitions, thin sheets of living tissue, known as mesenteries. The gonads are also located within the cavity walls. The polyp is retractable into the corallite, the stony cup in which it sits, being pulled back by sheet-like retractor muscles.|$|E

5|$|When Sodh was {{twenty-two years}} old, he was ordained at Wat Songpinong in his {{hometown}} and was given the Pāli language monastic name Candasaro. Phra (phra meaning 'monk, venerable') Candasaro studied both under masters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> meditation tradition as well as experts in scriptural analysis, which was uncommon during that period. In his autobiographical notes, he wrote that he practiced meditation every day, {{from the first day}} following his ordination. In his first years as a monk, he had difficulty obtaining food on traditional alms rounds, where monks go house to house looking for laypeople to offer them food. This hardship led him to resolve that he would one day built a kitchen for monastics, who would then enjoy convenience in the spiritual life. After his third rainy season (third year after monk's ordination), Phra Candasaro traveled far and wide in Thailand to study scriptures and meditation practice with teachers from established traditions. He learnt about a broad range of things, and was in the habit of respecting all spiritual things. He studied scriptures at Wat Pho and learnt about meditation at eight centers, among which Wat Ratchasittharam. At Wat Ratchasittharam he studied a visualization meditation method with Luang Por Aium, and experienced a development in meditation regarded as important, when he perceived a sphere of light. Buddhist Studies scholars Kate Crosby and Catherine Newell believe Wat Ratchasittharam to be crucial in Luang Pu Sodh's development of Dhammakaya meditation.|$|E
