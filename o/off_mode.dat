40|$|A {{cogeneration}} plant, feeding its output {{water into}} a district-heating grid, may include several types of energy producing units. The most important being the cogeneration unit, which produces both heat and electricity. Most plants also have a heat water storage. Finding the optimal production of both heat and electricity and the optimal use of the storage is a difficult optimization problem. This paper formulates a general approach for the mathematical modeling of a cogeneration plant. The model objective function is nonlinear, with nonlinear constraints. Internal plant temperatures, mass flows, storage losses, minimal up and down times and time depending start-up costs are considered. The unit commitment, i. e. the units on and <b>off</b> <b>modes,</b> is found with an algorithm based on Lagrangian relaxation. The dual search direction is given by the subgradient method and the step length by the Polyak rule II.

40|$|Filament-type HfO 2 -based RRAM {{has been}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most promising candidates for future non-volatile memories. Further improvement of the stability, particularly at the "OFF" state, of such devices is mainly hindered by resistance variation induced by the uncontrolled oxygen vacancies distribution and filament growth in HfO 2 films. We report highly stable endurance of TiN/Ti/HfO 2 /Si-tip RRAM devices using a CMOS compatible nanotip method. Simulations indicate that the nanotip bottom electrode provides a local confinement for the electrical field and ionic current density; thus a nano-confinement for the oxygen vacancy distribution and nano-filament location is created by this approach. Conductive atomic force microscopy measurements confirm that the filaments form only on the nanotip region. Resistance switching by using pulses shows highly stable endurance for both ON and <b>OFF</b> <b>modes,</b> thanks to the geometric confinement of the conductive path and filament only above the nanotip. This nano-engineering approach opens a new pathway to realize forming-free RRAM devices with improved stability and reliability...|$|R
