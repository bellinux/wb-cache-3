25|$|Also {{at about}} this time, the {{attention}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>community</b> (as {{manifested in the}} UN) {{began to focus on}} the same theme, similarly re-calibrating its concern for minorities into concern for the rights of indigenous peoples. In 1982 the Working Group on Indigenous Populations of the Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights (then called Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities) was established by a decision of the United Nations Economic and Social Council, and in 1985 work began on drafting a declaration of rights (a process which lasted 22 years). In due course, 1993 was proclaimed the International Year of the World's Indigenous People. The following year, the United Nations General Assembly launched the International Decade of the World's Indigenous Peoples (1995–2004) and then, on September 13, 2007, it adopted a Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.|$|E

On the one side they have the dark menace of Soviet Russia. On the other the chaos of China four or five provinces of which are being tortured under Communist rule".

A Communist Spain reaching its snaky tentacles through Portugal and France is another, and many will think the worse." [...] He supported the Hoare-Laval Pact and continued up until 1937 to praise Benito Mussolini.

Suffice it here to remark, that the increasing control of a child's welfare and upbringing by the community, and the growing disposition to limit and tax inheritance are complementary aspects of the general tendency to regard the welfare and free intraplay of future generations no longer as the concern of parents and altruistic individuals, but as the predominant issue of statesmanship, and the duty and moral meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>community</b> as a whole.|$|E
