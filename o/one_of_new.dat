5|$|After the Second World War, Māori were {{discouraged}} from speaking {{their own language}} (te reo Māori) in schools and workplaces and it existed as a community language only in a few remote areas.

After six months in this role, in February 1947 he was promoted to major general and made chief judge of the Allied Control Commission's Supreme Court. The following year he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath.|$|E

In Norwich, NY319 served Emmanuel Episcopal Church and passed through the Chenango County Courthouse District, established in 1975 in the city's downtown area. In the center of the historic district, NY319 reached its eastern terminus at its intersection with NY12 (Broad Street). West Main Street becomes East Main Street at this junction, and the latter continues eastward as NY990L, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York's reference routes.|$|E

A -long jetty was built at Fortrose in 1875, although this has long since disappeared. Several shipwrecks occurred along the treacherous coastline during this period. Most notably, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Zealand's worst shipping disasters occurred here: {{the wreck of the}} passenger-steamer Tararua, en route from Bluff to Port Chalmers, which foundered off Waipapa Point on 29 April 1881 with the loss of all but 20 of the 151 people aboard.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 1946 season, Rocco was {{competing}} with Les Fleming and Eddie Robinson for the starting first baseman job. Fleming won {{the job and}} held it, though Rocco saw occasional playing time until June 26, when he was traded with cash to the Chicago Cubs for first baseman Heinz Becker in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> owner Bill Veeck's first moves. However, Rocco refused to report the Nashville Volunteers, the Cubs' minor league organization, and considered quitting the game, which put the trade on hold. He eventually did report to Nashville, and finished the year having played 34 games in the majors and 37 games in the minors. After the season the Boston Red Sox signed him to a contract as a potential backup first baseman, {{but he did not}} make the cut, and was sent to the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League just before the 1947 season started.|$|E

5|$|Hostile native {{tribes and}} {{distance}} from nearby Spanish colonies discouraged settlers from {{moving to the}} area. It was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Spain's least populated provinces. In 1749, the Spanish peace treaty with the Lipan Apache angered many tribes, including the Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai. The Comanche signed a treaty with Spain in 1785 and later helped to defeat the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes. With more numerous missions being established, priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes. By {{the end of the}} 18th century only a few nomadic tribes had not converted to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|In New Zealand, Malone's {{death was}} widely {{reported}} and keenly felt, {{particularly in the}} Taranaki region. The soldiers of the Wellington Regiment held their former commander in high regard and paid {{for the construction of}} the Malone Memorial Gate, white marble gates at the entrance to King Edward Park in Stratford. The gate, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Zealand's largest war memorials that commemorates an individual soldier, was officially opened on 8 August 1923 in front of a large crowd. The gate is the scene of an annual ceremony held on 8 August to commemorate the memory of Malone. A fictionalised colonel based on Malone was a major character in a 1982 play written by Maurice Shadbolt, Once on Chunuk Bair, which told the story of the Wellington Battalion's battle of 8 August. In 1992, the play was filmed as Chunuk Bair. A plaque in his honour was unveiled in the New Zealand Parliament's Grand Hall in 2005.|$|E
5|$|In late 1832, the Democratic Party {{convention}} nominated Pierce for <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Hampshire's five {{seats in}} the U.S. House of Representatives. This was tantamount to election for the young Democrat, as the National Republicans had faded as a political force, while the Whigs had not yet begun to attract a large following. Democratic strength in New Hampshire was also bolstered by Jackson's landslide re-election that year. New Hampshire had been a marginal state politically, but from 1832 through the mid-1850s became the most reliably Democratic state in the North, boosting Pierce's political career. Pierce's term began in March 1833, {{but he would not}} be sworn in until Congress met in December, and his attention was elsewhere. He had recently become engaged and bought his first house in Hillsborough. Franklin and Benjamin Pierce were among the prominent citizens who welcomed President Jackson to the state on his visit in mid-1833.|$|E

5|$|Princes Street was {{developed}} during Dunedin's 1860s boom from the Central Otago gold rush, and consequently is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Zealand's most historic streets, with about 70 buildings {{in close proximity}} listed on the New Zealand Historic Places Trust Register. Originally {{the site of the}} city's wharf, a substantial area of land to the east of the street was formerly part of Otago Harbour, much of it reclaimed via rock removed during the lowering of Bell Hill which separated Princes Street from northern Dunedin {{in the early years of}} settlement. In the years following the gold rush, Princes Street was the heart of Dunedin's central business district, but much of the city's main retail area has now shifted north to George Street.|$|E
5|$|State legislatures elected U.S. Senators {{until the}} {{ratification}} of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913. In 1849 <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York's seats was up for election, and a Whig would likely be elected to replace John Adams Dix. Seward, with Weed's counsel, decided to seek the seat. When legislators convened in January 1849, he was spoken of as the favorite. Some opposed him as too extreme on slavery issues, and intimated {{that he would not}} support the slaveholding President-elect Taylor, a Louisianan. Weed and Seward worked to dispel these concerns, and when the vote for the Senate seat took place, the former governor received five times the vote of the nearest other candidate, gaining easy election on the first ballot.|$|E
5|$|Christchurch and its {{surrounding}} areas are unique in New Zealand for their particular style of Gothic architecture, {{something that can be}} directly attributed to Benjamin Mountfort. While Mountfort did accept small private domestic commissions, he is today better known for the designs executed for public, civic bodies, and the church. His monumental Gothic stone civic buildings in Christchurch, which would not be out of place in Oxford or Cambridge, are an amazing achievement over adversity of materials. His hallmark wooden Gothic churches today epitomise the 19th-century province of Canterbury. They are accepted, and indeed appear as part of the landscape. In this way, Benjamin Mountfort's achievement was to make his favoured style of architecture synonymous with the identity of the province of Canterbury. Following his death, one of his seven children, Cyril, continued to work in his father's Gothic style well into the 20th century. Cyril Mountfort was responsible for the church of St Luke's in the City, which was an unexecuted design of his father's. In this way, and through the daily public use of his many buildings, Mountfort's legacy lives on. He ranks today with his contemporary R A Lawson as <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Zealand's greatest 19th-century architects.|$|E
