5|$|Many {{localized}} {{areas are}} subject to human-made pollution {{of the air and}} water, acid rain and toxic substances, loss of vegetation (<b>overgrazing,</b> deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{threatened}} because of habitat destruction. At the Forêt du Day site, 95% of its preferred juniper habitat is dead or dying and {{is unable to}} support this bird. While an overarching reason behind this destruction remains unknown, <b>overgrazing</b> by cattle, camels, and goats {{is believed to have}} been a significant contributor, along with rain, climate change, and a fungal disease. Hunting, the gathering of firewood, egg collecting, and general human disturbance are also believed to be threats. At the Mabla Mountains site, the habitat is also being degraded by the collection of firewood and <b>overgrazing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Additional key {{threatening}} {{processes that}} are considered likely to impact the bristle-faced free-tailed bat include the alteration to natural flow regimes, competition from introduced western honey bees (Apis mellifera) for tree hollows, inappropriate fire regimes, reduction of invertebrate prey related to pesticide drift and lack of tree regeneration due to <b>overgrazing</b> and weeds.|$|E

5|$|Similar {{damage is}} being done today to the {{semi-arid}} areas that rim deserts and about twelve million hectares of land are being turned to desert each year. Desertification is caused by such factors as drought, climatic shifts, tillage for agriculture, <b>overgrazing</b> and deforestation. Vegetation {{plays a major role}} in determining the composition of the soil. In many environments, the rate of erosion and run off increases dramatically with reduced vegetation cover. Unprotected dry surfaces tend to be blown away by the wind or be washed away by flash floods, leaving infertile soil layers that bake in the sun and become unproductive hardpan. Although <b>overgrazing</b> has historically been considered to be a cause of desertification, there is some evidence that wild and domesticated animals actually improve fertility and vegetation cover, and that their removal encourages erosive processes.|$|E
5|$|Mites and {{nematodes}} feed on ticks, {{which are}} also a minor nutritional resource for birds. More importantly, they carry diseases as the primary hosts of pathogens such as spirochaetes, and without their agency, the organisms could not reach their secondary hosts. The diseases caused may debilitate their victims, and ticks may thus be assisting in controlling animal populations and preventing <b>overgrazing.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Overgrazing,</b> {{agriculture}} {{and the loss}} of wetland and moist grassland have reduced the availability of suitable habitat for the African crake in many areas, such as some parts of the southern KwaZulu-Natal coast which have been urbanised or planted with sugarcane. In other areas, grassland may have increased locally in recent years as woodland is cleared. This crake is considered to be good eating, and is killed for food in some regions. Despite these adverse factors, it appears to be under no real threat.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, conservationists became {{alarmed by the}} damage <b>overgrazing,</b> logging, and {{unregulated}} visitation were having on the fragile features of Bryce Canyon. A movement to have the area protected was soon started, and National Park Service Director Stephen Mather responded by proposing that Bryce Canyon {{be made into a}} state park. The governor of Utah and the Utah State Legislature, however, lobbied for national protection of the area. Mather relented and sent his recommendation to President Warren G. Harding, who on June 8, 1923 declared Bryce Canyon a national monument.|$|E
5|$|Before urban development, {{the damage}} caused by <b>overgrazing</b> during the Spanish period was still {{considered}} capable of recovery. However, the completion of Interstate 5 through the middle of the San Juan Creek watershed in the 1950s transformed the area into a bedroom community for Los Angeles and permanently erased many remaining grassland, meadow and riparian zones. The percent of urbanized land increased from 3percent in 1964 to 18percent in 1988. In the 1990s, the watershed was 32 percent urbanized. With continuing development in east San Juan Capistrano and Rancho Mission Viejo, the projected growth by 2050 is 50 percent.|$|E
5|$|<b>Overgrazing</b> by {{sheep in}} Grisedale Common has damaged the {{vegetation}} {{to the extent}} that it has needed careful management. Since 2003 grazing has been limited to one ewe per hectare (2.5 acres) in summer and 0.6 ewe in winter. In summer sheep are also flushed from the coves, (Nethermost and Ruthwaite) as they contain vegetation which is susceptible to damage from summer grazing. The vegetation structure has started to improve; however, recovery is slowest on the higher land and the summit is still heavily grazed. The summit suffers erosion from the large number of walkers who climb Nethermost Pike. The use of fewer footpaths would help reduce the disturbance to the summit species.|$|E

5|$|<b>Overgrazing</b> of meadows (especially by sheep), logging {{of giant}} sequoia, and other damage caused Muir {{to become an}} {{advocate}} for further protection. Muir convinced prominent guests {{of the importance of}} putting the area under federal protection; one such guest was Robert Underwood Johnson, editor of Century Magazine. Muir and Johnson lobbied Congress for the Act that created Yosemite National Park on October 1, 1890. The State of California, however, retained control of Yosemite Valley and Mariposa Grove. Muir also helped persuade local officials to virtually eliminate grazing from the Yosemite high country.|$|E
5|$|Stokes {{explicitly}} {{stated the}} tammar wallaby to be absent from North Island in 1840, {{and it was}} not recorded by the Percy Sladen Trust Expedition in 1913. It was apparently introduced to the island in the 1920s, as early fishermen reported seeing it between 1928 and 1930. This introduction failed, possibly due to <b>overgrazing.</b> The species was not found by Serventy during his 1945 visit, nor by Storr in 1959, but the latter found plenty of remains, mostly mandibles. Storr interpreted these remains as predating the 1920s introduction, suggesting that a native population of tammars became extinct on the island before 1840. Albert Russell Main agreed, but the theory has not been accepted by later researchers.|$|E
5|$|The African crake {{has a huge}} {{breeding}} range estimated at 11,700,000km2 (4,500,000mi2). Its population is unknown, but it is common in most of its range, and its numbers appear to be stable. It is therefore classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. <b>Overgrazing,</b> agriculture {{and the loss of}} wetland and moist grassland have reduced the availability of suitable habitat in many areas, such as some parts of the southern KwaZulu-Natal coast which have been urbanised or planted with sugarcane. In other areas, grassland may have increased locally in recent years as woodland is cleared. This crake is considered to be good eating, and is killed for food in some regions.

5|$|The lesser kudu's shyness and {{its ability}} to {{camouflage}} itself in dense cover has protected it from the risks of poaching. For instance, the lesser kudu is widespread in the Ogaden region, which is rich in dense bush, despite reckless hunting by local people. However, rinderpest outbreaks, to which the lesser kudu is highly susceptible, have resulted in a steep decline of 60% in the animal's population in Tsavo National Park in Kenya. <b>Overgrazing,</b> human settlement, and loss of habitat are some other threats to the survival of the lesser kudu.|$|E
5|$|The saxaul sparrow {{is found}} in remote parts of Central Asia, where its {{distribution}} is believed to fall into six disjunct areas, although this is uncertain due to the scarcity of records. It {{is found in}} deserts, especially around rivers and oases. It is usually found around shrubs such as saxaul (Haloxylon), poplar (Populus), or tamarisk (Tamarix). Sometimes it occurs around settlements and grain fields, especially during the winter. It is not believed to be threatened, since it is reported as locally common across a wide range, and hence it is assessed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. However, {{it seems to have}} lost large parts of its range to the intensification of agriculture and desertification caused by <b>overgrazing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Changes in the grazing {{habits of}} Ethiopia's {{indigenous}} peoples following the recent trend of settling in permanent villages have negatively impacted the Stresemann's bushcrow. While previously grazers left the soil loose {{and covered in}} dung to support the bushcrow's prey, this new lifestyle has resulted in <b>overgrazing</b> and soil compaction in some areas. The idea of private land ownership has also led to intensive planting of cash crops such as maize. The rich soil that the species needs to forage is also prime farming land. In the Yabello Wildlife Sanctuary, acacia trees are being collected for firewood, removing the bushcrow's nesting site. While protected under law, this sanctuary has difficulties enforcing the law. It is believed that between 1999 and 2003 {{the population of the}} bushcrow declined by 80%.|$|E

5|$|Its {{natural habitat}} is high {{altitude}} subtropical or tropical dry forests composed primarily of African juniper. However, the juniper forests preferred by the francolin are dying, {{so it may}} be found in other habitats, such as box-tree forests. This bird is only known from two locations in Djibouti, one of which is largely unsurveyed. It can be found in small groups and is extremely shy. It is known to feed on berries, seeds, and termites, and it breeds between December and February. It is considered a critically endangered species because it underwent a 90% population decline in twenty years. The degrading of its juniper habitat through man-made disturbances, such as <b>overgrazing,</b> is a major threat to the francolin's survival. Ongoing conservation work includes the restoration of some juniper forest, and surveys to obtain accurate population counts and to raise awareness.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's good arable and {{pastoral}} land is found {{mostly in the}} south and east of the country. Heavy rainfall, wind and salt spray, in combination with thin soil and <b>overgrazing,</b> made most of the western islands treeless. The terrain often made internal land communication difficult, encouraging a coastal network. In the Neolithic period, from around 6,000 years ago, there is evidence of permanent settlements and farming. The two main sources of food were grain and cow milk. From the Bronze Age, arable land spread at the expense of forest. From the Iron Age, there were hill forts in southern Scotland associated with cultivation ridges and terraces and the fertile plains were already densely exploited for agriculture. During the period of Roman occupation of Britain there was re-growth of trees indicating a reduction in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} common trees that grow in the Big Butte Creek {{watershed}} include four species of fir, two species of pine, incense cedar, and western hemlock. The understory contains plants such as Pacific yew, Pacific madrone, chinquapin, and vine maple. Several invasive species {{have been reported in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, such as Kentucky bluegrass, common bent, drooping brome, and redtop. The spread of these species is most likely due to <b>overgrazing.</b> Sensitive species that grow in the watershed include Howell's yampah, Egg Lake monkeyflower, clustered lady's slipper, green-flowered ginger, Mount Mazama collomia, and Detling's microseris. Mallow and popcorn flower have also been discovered in riparian zones. The Poverty Flats Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) is home to several rare species of plants, including Bellinger's meadowfoam, Howell's yampah, and Rocky Mountain woodsia.|$|E
