The NASA team 2 algorithm, previously {{developed for the}} NASA advanced microwave scanning radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E) product suite, is adapted for operational use with the JAXA AMSR 2 sensor through several enhancements. First, the algorithm is modified to process individual swaths and provide concentration from the most recent swaths instead of a 24 -hour average. A latency (time since observation) field and a 24 -hour concentration range (maximum-minimum) are included to provide indications of data timeliness and variability. Concentration from the Bootstrap algorithm is a secondary field to provide complementary sea ice information. A quality flag is implemented to provide information on interpolation, filtering, and other quality control steps. The AMSR 2 concentration fields are compared with a different AMSR 2 passive microwave product, and then validated via comparison with sea ice concentration from the Suomi visible and infrared imaging radiometer suite. This validation indicates the AMSR 2 concentrations have a bias of 3. 9 % and an RMSE of 11. 0 % in the Arctic, and a bias of 4. 45 % and RMSE of 8. 8 % in the Antarctic. In most cases, the NOAA operational requirements for accuracy are met.

40|$|Concerns {{about climate}} change and fossil fuel {{shortages}} are encouraging interest in stumps, as alternative energy sources. Stumps are an almost unused resource {{in the context of}} bio fuels. Stump harvesting signifies an intensification of forest management compared with conventional stem-only or above-ground biomass-only harvesting. There are many benefits of stump harvesting. These include: the production of wood fuel, fossil fuel substitution, and improved soil preparation. Removing tree trunks in Hungary has been going on according to the principle of stump extraction, which means stumps are removed by grabbing technology. Experiments have been carried out to reduce the extraction force. In the Great Hungarian Lowland, where large areas require the <b>operation</b> <b>implementation,</b> stump extraction is done by special, hydraulic driven baggers equipped with a special bucket. During operation of the equipment, we carried out measurements of the extraction force and the time requirement. The experiments are designed to carry out the measurements with different soils and different tree species. According to our proposal the suitable force and torque required to remove stumps can be significantly reduced if before the lifting the soil — root connection is loosened. One of the possible ways to implement this task is the use of vibration. Since relatively great vibration power and wide domain of frequency are necessary, therefore we prepared the loosening machinery elements of alternating-current hydraulics system. Based on constructions variants we created a tractor-mounted experimental alternating-current hydraulic stump-loosening machine.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a laser range scanner (LARS) as a three-dimensional sensor for space applications. The scanner is a versatile system capable of doing surface imaging, target ranging and tracking. It is capable of short range (0. 5 m to 20 m) and long range (20 m to 10 km) sensing using triangulation and time-of-flight (TOF) methods respectively. At short range (1 m), the resolution is sub-millimeter and drops gradually with distance (2 cm at 10 m). For long range, the TOF provides a constant resolution of plus or minus 3 cm, independent of range. The LARS could complement the existing Canadian Space Vision System (CSVS) for robotic manipulation. As an active vision system, the LARS is immune to sunlight and adverse lighting; this is a major advantage over the CSVS, as outlined in this paper. The LARS could also replace existing radar systems used for rendezvous and docking. There are clear advantages of an optical system over a microwave radar in terms of size, mass, power and precision. Equipped with two high-speed galvanometers, the laser can be steered to address any point in a 30 degree X 30 degree field of view. The scanning can be continuous (raster scan, Lissajous) or direct (random). This gives the scanner the ability to register high-resolution 3 D images of range and intensity (up to 4000 X 4000 pixels) and to perform point target tracking as well as object recognition and geometrical tracking. The imaging capability of the scanner using an eye-safe laser is demonstrated. An efficient fiber laser delivers 60 mW of CW or 3 (mu) J pulses at 20 kHz for TOF <b>operation.</b> <b>Implementation</b> of search and track of multiple targets is also demonstrated. For a single target, refresh rates up to 137 Hz is possible. Considerations for space qualification of the scanner are discussed.

40|$|In {{the world}} – based on recent frauds in {{financial}} reporting of partial {{deregulation of the}} financial system, {{as some of the}} causes for the latest economic crisis, there is once again a growing distrust in external audit, which again yields their growing distrust of the public and investors of the entire financial system. In recent years, even before the latest economic crisis, the emphasis in overlapping the gap in the quality of financial reporting was put on developing a model of internal audit functioning. Even besides the undoubtedly positive effect resulting from developing various models of internal control, sometimes catastrophic consequences of fraud were not avoided. International standards and code of ethics represent some of the instruments for the securing of independence and objectivity of auditors and professional accountants in regards to management demands. The objective of conducted interdisciplinary research was to point out the important role of personality traits and morality in acknowledgement of ethic principles by management, auditors and professional accountants in organization of corporate financial business <b>operation,</b> <b>implementation</b> of the systems of internal control and evaluating their functionality. This paper presents the results of personality trait research, evaluated by the questionnaire “Big five plus two“ and of the morality of management, auditors and accountants from 15 companies (public, joint stock, limited liability, middle and big companies, and auditing houses). The research was conducted on the sample of 95 respondents (of both sexes, aged between 25 and 60).
