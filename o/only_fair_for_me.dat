40|$|The {{epistemological}} approach I’m {{going to}} offer in this paper owes much of its prompting motivation to Quine’s ideas, esp. holism and naturalism, {{as well as to}} Ferdinand Gonseth’s idoneism.

In order {{to make it easier to}} follow my reflections below through their sometimes winding course, I now proceed to list the 13 main components of my proposal.

40|$|Objectives: Generalized {{periodic}} discharges (GPDs) {{are associated}} with nonconvulsive seizures. Triphasic waves (TWs), a subtype of GPDs, have been described in relation to metabolic encephalopathy and not felt {{to be associated with}} seizures. We sought to establish the consistency of use of this descriptive term and its association with seizures. Methods: 11 experts in continuous EEG monitoring scored 20 cEEG samples containing GPDs using Standardized Critical Care EEG Terminology. In the absence of patient information, the inter-rater agreement (IRA) for EEG descriptors including TWs was assessed along with raters' clinical EEG interpretation and compared with actual patient information. Results: The IRA for 'generalized' and 'periodic' was near-perfect (kappa = 0. 81), but <b>fair</b> <b>for</b> 'triphasic' (kappa = 0. 33). Patients with TWs were as likely to develop seizures as those without (25 % vs 26 %, N. S.) and surprisingly, patients with TWs were less likely to have toxic-metabolic encephalopathy than those without TWs (55 % vs 79 %, p < 0. 01). Conclusions: While IRA for the terms "generalized" and "periodic" is high, it is <b>only</b> <b>fair</b> <b>for</b> TWs. EEG interpreted as TWs presents similar risk for seizures as GPDs without triphasic appearance. GPDs are commonly associated with metabolic encephalopathy, but 'triphasic' appearance is not predictive. Significance: Conventional association of 'triphasic waves' with specific clinical conditions may lead to inaccurate EEG interpretation. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
25|$|This was all {{the more}} galling given that, under the Spaniards and Austrians, the city's {{inhabitants}} received no compensation for all this: they were to provide housing to the soldiers free of charge. The government claimed that since the garrison's presence brought trade and business which benefited the city's merchants and artisans, it was <b>only</b> <b>fair</b> <b>for</b> citizens to contribute by lodging the troops. Nor was the burden of quartering troops shared equally, by any means: there were many exemptions, reflecting the social inequality of the Ancien Régime society. The justiciar, the aldermen, lawyers, members of the provincial council, and the nobility were exempt. The magistrates assigned soldiers to houses, and to this effect made lists with very detailed descriptions of houses' interiors. Abuses of power could not be prevented: the authorities were known to assign an excessive number of soldiers to the houses of residents who had been involved in disputes with the city. Citizens tried to wriggle out of these obligations by deliberately not keeping all rooms in their house fit for habitation; the wealthier inhabitants were able to avoid taking in soldiers by paying their way out.|$|R

40|$|The {{interobserver}} {{reliability of}} lumbar spinal signs is low for many signs but {{little has been}} published {{on the ability of}} training to improve this. This small study describes the interobserver reliability of some common lumbar spinal signs and the effect of a brief training intervention on this reliability. Four subjects with low back pain underwent a lumbar spinal examination by four doctors. Posture, pain on movement, leg length inequality and tenderness was tested. After a 40 minute session comparing findings an d examination techniques, the four doctors examined a different four subjects with low back pain. Kappa coefficients of agreement on the eight subjects' findings were moderate for scoliosis, poor for iliac crest height and <b>only</b> <b>fair</b> <b>for</b> the forwards flexion test. Agreement was substantial to almost perfect for pain ion movement tests. Agreement for tests of leg length inequality was slight to moderate and was moderate to substantial for regional tenderness. Agreement was essentially unchanged before and after training for fourteen of the eighteen tests. However, agreement decreased after training for forward flexion test, pain on flexion, left iliac crest tenderness and left buttock tenderness. These decreases may have resulted from small sample sizes and differences in the subjects between sessions. Nonetheless, the results suggest that far more than 40 minutes training is required to improve agreement between doctors examining the lumbar spine. Griffith Health FacultyNo Full Tex...|$|R
