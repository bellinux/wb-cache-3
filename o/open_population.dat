40|$|Lemmings are {{a classic}} example of animals with strong {{population}} cycles. High-amplitude density fluctuations with low numbers during the low phase are expected to lead to strong genetic drift, which erodes genetic variability. By compiling data on mitochondrial DNA polymorphism for 72 lemming populations from 5 species, we found no evidence for this erosive mechanism. On the contrary, high levels of haplotype diversity (average h of 0. 75 for samples of the genus Lemmus) were observed in many populations. Although the effective size determines the level of genetic diversity in closed populations, diversity is primarily determined by immigration in <b>open</b> <b>populations.</b> Simulations of genetic drift in <b>open</b> <b>populations</b> fluctuating in density confirmed the independence of genetic variability from local effective size, and predicted a deficit of rare alleles, as observed in lemming samples.

40|$|The genetic {{mating system}} is a key {{component}} of the sexual selection process, yet methods for the quantification of mating systems remain controversial. One approach involves metrics derived from Bateman's principles, which are based on variances in mating and reproductive success and the relationship between them. However, these measures are extremely difficult to measure for both sexes in <b>open</b> <b>populations,</b> because missing data can result in biased estimates. Here, we develop a novel approach for the estimation of mating system metrics based on Bateman's principles and apply it to a microsatellite-based parentage analysis of a natural population of the dusky pipefish, Syngnathus floridae. Our results show that both male and female dusky pipefish have significantly positive Bateman gradients. However, females exhibit larger values of the opportunity for sexual selection and the opportunity for selection compared to males. These differences translate into a maximum intensity of sexual selection (inline image) for females three times larger than that for males. Overall, this study identifies a critical source of bias that affects studies of mating systems in <b>open</b> <b>populations,</b> presents a novel method for overcoming this bias, and applies this method {{for the first time in}} a sex-role-reversed pipefish...|$|R
40|$|Human {{populations are}} often dichotomized into "isolated" and "open" {{categories}} using cultural and/or geographical barriers to gene flow as differential criteria. Although widespread, {{the use of}} these alternative categories could obscure further heterogeneity due to inter-population differences in effective size, growth rate, and timing or amount of gene flow. We compared intra and inter-population variation measures combining novel and literature data relative to 87, 818 autosomal SNPs in 14 <b>open</b> <b>populations</b> and 10 geographic and/or linguistic European isolates. Patterns of intra-population diversity were found to vary considerably more among isolates, probably due to differential levels of drift and inbreeding. The relatively large effective size estimated for some population isolates challenges the generalized view that they originate from small founding groups. Principal component scores based on measures of intra-population variation of isolated and <b>open</b> <b>populations</b> were found to be distributed along a continuum, with an area of intersection between the two groups. Patterns of inter-population diversity were even closer, as we were able to detect some differences between population groups only for a few multidimensional scaling dimensions.

Abundance of the epaulette shark, Hemiscyllium ocellatum (Bonnaterre), on Heron Island Reef, Great Barrier Reef, Australia, was examined via a mark-recapture study. A total of 496 sharks was tagged between July 1994 and August 1997 in a 0. 25 -km 2 area of reef flat, with 80 tagged sharks recaptured for a total of 102 recapture events. Captured individuals ranged in size from juveniles to adults (285 – 750 mm total length). Recaptured sharks were collected after 1 – 725 days at liberty and at distances of 0 – 329 m from their original capture point. The overall recapture rate was 20. 6 % with an estimated 17. 5 % tag loss. Population size was estimated using both closed and <b>open</b> <b>population</b> models.

40|$|Traditional {{analyses}} of capture-recapture data {{are based on}} likelihood functions that explicitly integrate out all missing data. We use a complete data likelihood (CDL) to show how {{a wide range of}} capture-recapture models can be easily fitted using readily available software JAGS/BUGS even when there are individual-specific time-varying covariates. The models we describe extend those that condition on first capture to include abundance parameters, or parameters related to abundance, such as population size, birth rates or lifetime. The use of a CDL means that any missing data, including uncertain individual covariates, can be included in models without the need for customized likelihood functions.

40|$|This article {{introduces}} Rcapture, an R {{package for}} capture-recapture experiments. The data for analysis {{consists of the}} frequencies of the observable capture histories over the t capture occasions of the experiment. A capture history is a vector of zeros and ones where one stands for a capture and zero for a miss. Rcapture can fit three types of models. With a closed population model, {{the goal of the}} analysis is to estimate the size N of the population which is assumed to be constant throughout the experiment. The estimator depends on {{the way in which the}} capture probabilities of the animals vary. Rcapture features several models for these capture probabilities that lead to different estimators for N. In an <b>open</b> <b>population</b> model, immigration and death occur between sampling periods. The estimation of survival rates is of primary interest. Rcapture can fit the basic Cormack-Jolly-Seber and Jolly-Seber model to such data. The third type of models fitted by Rcapture are robust design models. It features two levels of sampling; closed population models apply within primary periods and an <b>open</b> <b>population</b> model applies between periods. Most models in Rcapture have a loglinear form; they are fitted by carrying out a Poisson regression with the R function glm. Estimates of the demographic parameters of interest are derived from the loglinear parameter estimates; their variances are obtained by linearization. The novel feature of this package is the provision of several new options for modeling capture probabilities heterogeneity between animals in both closed population models and the primary periods of a robust design. It also implements many of the techniques developed by R. M. Cormack for <b>open</b> <b>population</b> models. ...|$|E

40|$|Populations {{near their}} {{equilibrium}} {{are expected to}} show density-dependence through a negative feedback {{on at least one}} demographic parameter, e. g. survival and/or productivity. Nevertheless, it is not always clear which vital rate is affected the most, and even less whether this dependence holds in <b>open</b> <b>populations</b> in which immigration and emigration are also important. We assessed the relative importance of population density in the variation of local survival, recruitment, proportion of transients (emigrants) and productivity through the analysis of detailed life-histories of 4286 seabirds from a colony that reached an apparent demographic equilibrium after a period of exponential increase. We provide evidence that the role of population density and resource availability changes according to the demographic parameter considered. Estimates indicated that transients increased from 5 % to 20 % over the study period, suggesting an average turnover of about 1400 individuals per year. The parameters most influenced by population density alone were local survival and probability of transience. Recruitment was negatively associated with population density during the increasing phase but unexpected high values were also recorded at high population levels. These high values were explained by a combination of population size and food availability. Mean productivity varied with food availability, independently from population variations. The population density alone explained up to a third of the yearly variation of the vital rates considered, suggesting that <b>open</b> <b>populations</b> are equally influenced by stochastic and density-independent events (such as environmental perturbations) than by intrinsic (i. e. density-dependent) factors. © Oikos.
