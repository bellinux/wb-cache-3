25|$|Impulsive/Premeditated Aggression Scale (IPAS) is a 30-item self-report questionnaire. Half of {{the items}} {{describe}} impulsive aggression and half the items describe premeditated aggression. Aggressive behavior has traditionally been classified into two distinct subtypes, impulsive or premeditated. Impulsive aggression {{is defined as a}} hair-trigger aggressive response to provocation with loss of behavioral control. Premeditated aggression is defined as a planned or conscious aggressive act, not spontaneous or related to an agitated state. The IPAS is designed to characterize aggressive behavior as predominately impulsive or predominately premeditated in nature. Those subjects who clustered on the impulsive factor showed a broad range <b>of</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> cognitive impairments; those who clustered on the premeditated factor showed a greater inclination for aggression and anti-social behaviour.|$|E
25|$|Klimt invited Schiele {{to exhibit}} {{some of his}} work at the 1909 Vienna Kunstschau, where he {{encountered}} the work of Edvard Munch, Jan Toorop, and Vincent van Gogh among others. Once free of the constraints of the Academy's conventions, Schiele began to explore not only the human form, but also human sexuality. Schiele's work was already daring, but it went a bold step further with the inclusion of Klimt's decorative eroticism and with what some may like to call figurative distortions, that included elongations, deformities, and sexual openness. Schiele's self-portraits helped re-establish the energy of both genres with their unique level <b>of</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> sexual honesty and use of figural distortion in place of conventional ideals of beauty. He also painted tributes to Van Gogh's Sunflowers as well as landscapes and still lifes.|$|E

(b) To what extent do <b>emotional</b> disturbance <b>and</b> delinquency co-occur during adolescence and young adulthood? and (c) What are the longitudinal associations between <b>emotional</b> disturbance <b>and</b> delinquency in different age and gender categories during adolescence and young adulthood? Data were used from a national sample of 1, 302 adolescents and young adults, who participated in a 6 -year 3 -wave longitudinal study. Findings showed an increase <b>of</b> <b>emotional</b> disturbance <b>and</b> delinquency from early to midadolescence, after which <b>emotional</b> disturbance stabilized <b>and</b> delinquency declined into young adulthood. A significant but relatively weak co-occurrence <b>of</b> <b>emotional</b> disturbance <b>and</b> delinquency was found. Multigroup LISREL analyses demonstrated that a stability model with no cross-lagged relations fit best for the total sample, and across age and gender categories. Thus, co-occurrence <b>of</b> <b>emotional</b> disturbance <b>and</b> delinquency during adolescence and young adulthood seems to result from associated but separate psychopathological processes. The strong stability of internalizing and externalizing behavior suggests that prevention efforts should be aimed at children and young adolescents...|$|R

2500|$|Due to {{the flawed}} {{research}} that has been conducted in the past, many stereotypes have followed ACOAs. ACOAs {{have been identified as}} having a variety <b>of</b> <b>emotional</b> <b>and</b> behavioral problems, such as sleep problems, aggression and lowered self-esteem. [...] When it comes to being a COA or ACOA, there is still hope. Results showed that a supportive and loving relationship with one of the parents can counterbalance the possible negative effects of the relationship with the alcoholic parent. When there is one alcoholic parent in the household, it helps if the child relies on other family members for support. It may be the second parent, siblings or members of the extended family. Having other supportive family members can help the child feel like s/he is not alone. Younger generations of ACOAs scored more positively, in terms of coping mechanisms. This may be due to fact that alcoholism is seen more as an illness nowadays, rather than a moral defect. There has been less victim blaming of alcoholism on parent’s, because it has now been declared a disease rather than a behavioral problem. Studies show that when ACOAs use positive coping mechanisms, it is related to more positive results. When an ACOA approaches their issues, rather than avoids them, it often relates to having a positive outlook. Studies have shown that ACOAs and COAs have more compulsive behaviors that may cause the need for higher achievement. Some ACOAs have shown {{that the only way to}} survive is to fend for themselves. This causes a sense of independence that helps them become more self-reliant. Because they perceive that independence and hard work as necessary, ACOAs develop a sense of survival instinct.|$|E
