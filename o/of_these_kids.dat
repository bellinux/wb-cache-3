25|$|In October 2010, The Forward {{reported}} on {{the current state of}} Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and {{professor of history at the}} University of Lund, stated that members of the Swedish Riksdag have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. Charles Small, former director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Anti-Semitism, stated that “Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It’s a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for.” Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for Svenska Dagbladet and well known for his pro-Israeli stance for decades, has sharply criticised politicians who he says offer “weak excuses” for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. “Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying that the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> is in some way our fault.” Much of the anti-semitism in the country has been attributed to the growing Muslim immigrant population.|$|E

[...] Often compared to The Simpsons and King of the Hill, South Park, according to Tom Lappin of Scotland on Sunday, [...] "has a truly malevolent streak that sets it apart" [...] from these shows; he cites the repeated death of Kenny as an example.|$|E

[...] The humor of the show comes from the disparity between the cute appearance of the characters and their crude behavior. However, Parker and Stone said in an early interview that the show's language is realistic. [...] "There are so many shows where little kids are good and sweet, and it's just not real... Don't people remember what they were like in third grade? We were little bastards." ...|$|E

500|$|On December 18, 2007, {{prosecutor}} Hans Mos officially {{declared the}} case closed, {{and that no}} charges would be filed {{due to lack of}} evidence. The prosecution indicated a continuing interest in the Kalpoes and Van der Sloot (though they legally ceased to be suspects), and alleged that one of the three, in a chat room message, had stated that Holloway was dead. This was hotly contested by Deepak Kalpoe's attorney, who stated that the prosecution, in translating from Papiamento to Dutch, had misconstrued a reference to a teacher who had drowned as one to Holloway. Attorney Ronald Wix also stated, [...] "Unless (Mos) finds a body in the bathroom of one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids,</b> there's no way in hell they can arrest them anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|Amelia Gentleman of The Guardian {{described}} Lohan as [...] "better {{known for}} what is euphemistically termed a party lifestyle" [...] and said that while her participation did bring publicity to the project, the attention was uniformly negative and about her person, not the issues. Of the documentary she said that [...] "the material is potent and persuasive", but that Lohan was a [...] "constant, distracting presence". Sam Wollaston of The Guardian wrote a satirical, mocking letter ostensibly {{from the point of}} view of Lohan: [...] "Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> are sent to work when they're so young. Which I can relate to because I started out working as a child model aged three, and got into movies when I was 11. I can, like, so totally understand where these people are coming from".|$|E

Lauryn was {{in the living room}} next to the studio with about fifteen Marley grandchildren around her, the children of Ziggy, and Stephen, and Julian, and she starts singing this rap verse, and all the kids start repeating the last word of each line, chiming in very spontaneously because they were so into the song." [...] Columbia Records considered bringing in an outside producer for the album and had early talks with RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. However, Hill was adamant about writing, arranging, and producing the album herself: [...] "It would have been more difficult to articulate to other people. Hey, it's my album. Who can tell my story better than me?" [...] She recalled Ruffhouse Records executive Chris Swartz ensuring her artistic freedom while recording the album: [...] "I had total control of the album. Chris Swartz at Ruffhouse, my label, said, 'Listen, you've never done anything stupid thus far, so let me let you do your thing.'" ...|$|E

They praised each of the [...] "superb" [...] guest actors, particularly Harry Enfield, David Baddiel and Sally Phillips, who she thought played Angela [...] "brilliantly". Digital Spy's Neil Wilkes gave the episode a positive review, describing it as [...] "probably the most outrageous of the series to date". He wrote that the tension between Effy and Freddie [...] "set things up nicely" [...] for the following episode, which focused on Freddie. The entertainment editor for eurOut.org, a website for European lesbians, thought that the episode included [...] "a lot of confusing straight relationship drama" [...] and felt like she was [...] "stuck in high school hell". She wrote, however, that the brownie-making scene was [...] "so ridiculous it's kind of funny" [...] and likened Skins to [...] "Gossip Girl on crack". Jason Hughes of TV Squad felt that within the ensemble cast [...] "most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> were so unlikable", though he attributed this to the series [...] "show us their weaknesses". He found Pandora to be more likable, however, believing that her innocence was [...] "more representative of youth than most of the other characters". One reviewer for lesbian-based website AfterEllen.com called the episode [...] "must-see TV", while another reviewer expressed disapproval of the use of Katy Perry's song, [...] "I Kissed a Girl", in promotional videos for the episode.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} met with {{controversy}} upon its release when retail chain Walmart refused to carry the album unless an edited version was made.

At the end of the day, it's these kids who are getting fucked." [...] The edited version of the album removes the skull and crossbones, pentagram, and [...] "x" [...] from the album artwork; multiple pages are removed from the booklet, as are the album's lyrics. The title of [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore" [...] was shortened to simply [...] "The Ballad of Resurrection Joe". Seven years after the release of the album, Zombie released a deluxe edition of Hellbilly Deluxe featuring a bonus DVD. The DVD included a music video for all thirteen of the album's songs, with Zombie being credited as the director for all of them. The project was officially released on November 22, 2005.|$|E

After the war, a friend showed Hathcock a passage written by Ernest Hemingway: [...] "Certainly there is no hunting like the hunting of man, and those who have hunted armed men long enough and like it, never really care for anything else thereafter." [...] He copied Hemingway's words on a piece of paper. [...] "He got that right," [...] Hathcock said. [...] "It was the hunt, not the killing." [...] Hathcock said in a book written about his career as a sniper: [...] "I like shooting, and I love hunting. But I never did enjoy killing anybody. It's my job. If I don't get those bastards, then they're gonna kill a lot <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> dressed up like Marines. That's the way I look at it." ...|$|E

[...] Judith Popinski, and 86-year-old Holocaust survivor, stated that she is no longer invited to schools that have a large Muslim presence to tell her story of surviving the Holocaust. Popinski, who found refuge in Malmö in 1945, stated that, until recently, she told her story in Malmö schools as part of their Holocaust studies program, but that now, many schools no longer ask Holocaust survivors to tell their stories, because Muslim students treat them with such disrespect, either ignoring the speakers or walking out of the class. She further stated, [...] "Malmö reminds me of the anti-Semitism I felt as a child in Poland before the war. [...] "I am not safe as a Jew in Sweden anymore." ...|$|E

50|$|Social Causes: Some {{studies have}} shown that {{adolescents}} have one of the highest rates of polysubstance dependence. According to one study this population, ages 12-25, represents about half of the nation's illicit drug users. <b>Of</b> <b>these</b> illicit drug users, half of them have started using substances by the end of 12th grade. This could be attributed to social expectations of peers, peer pressure to fit it, or a way of numbing their emotions. Some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> young <b>kids</b> start trying different drugs initially to fit in, but then after a while they start to develop a tolerance for these substances and experience withdrawal if they don’t have enough substances in their system and eventually become dependent on having the effects of substance dependence. With tolerance comes the craving for additional drugs to get high, this constant need for that feeling is polysubstance dependence.|$|R

The average kidding interval for does that kidded in August-December (382 ± 90 days) was longer (P< 0. 01) than that for does that kidded in March-April (265 ± 48 days). The overall average kidding interval was 370 ± 122 days.
