25|$|The western margin area {{is bound}} by synclines and reverse thrusts faults and is {{structurally}} complex. Towards {{the south and}} east, reefs sub-crop against overlying strata, eventually cutting out against the Karoo {{to the east of}} the area. Most of the ore resource tends to be concentrated in reef bands located <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> distinct unconformities. Mining has taken place as mostly deep-level underground, exploiting the narrow, generally shallow dipping tabular reefs.|$|E

25|$|The main {{advantage}} of cleavage-stage biopsy over PB analysis {{is that the}} genetic input of both parents can be studied. On the other hand, cleavage-stage embryos are {{found to have a}} high rate of chromosomal mosaicism, putting into question whether the results obtained <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> blastomeres will be representative {{for the rest of the}} embryo. It is for this reason that some programs utilize a combination of PB biopsy and blastomere biopsy. Furthermore, cleavage-stage biopsy, as in the case of PB biopsy, yields a very limited amount of tissue for diagnosis, necessitating the development of single-cell PCR and FISH techniques.|$|E
25|$|Javas {{had nearly}} {{vanished}} {{by the end}} of the 20th century, having been pushed to fringes of the poultry world by the intense focus <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> breeds by commercial growers, and the introduction of innumerable new and exotic breeds to poultry fancy. Beginning in the 1990s, breeders and conservation organizations began to make a more concerted effort to save the Java. In particular, the Garfield Farm Museum in Illinois has played a pivotal role in the preservation of Javas in the 21st century. Beginning with Mottled and Black Javas, sports from the Garfield flock have revived the White variety. The Garfield Farm was also supported by the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, which hatched Java chicks as part of their exhibit on genetics.|$|E
25|$|Kilgore {{refused to}} debate Russ Potts, a {{decision}} which columnist Barnie Day said could strengthen Potts' underdog appeal {{and was a}} poor decision by Kilgore. It is unclear whether this had any effect on the election's outcome. Russ Potts polled 9% in a Mason-Dixon poll, but then dropped to 6% in a September poll. He needed to poll 15% in two separate polls to qualify {{for participation in the}} October Kaine-Kilgore debate. This poll was taken before Potts' TV ads ran. Although Potts was excluded from the final debate, he agreed to be sequestered in an office at Richmond's WTVR-TV during Sunday evening's debate and was not allowed to hear any of the questions nor any of the answers offered by his opponents. Minutes after the debate ended, Potts was taken into WTVR-TV studios where the station played back the debate in real time and recorded Potts' answers to each of the debate questions. WTVR-TV announced plans to air key segments of the 'virtual debate' on seven consecutive nights at 11 p.m., beginning Sunday October 16 through Saturday October 22. Each segment focuses <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> debate topics and presented the complete, timed answers from Mr. Kaine, Mr. Kilgore and Mr. Potts. The station also announced plans to present a composite one-hour virtual debate among the three candidates at 11:30p.m. on Sunday, October 23.|$|E

500|$|Mackay's {{account of}} inexplicable mania was unchallenged, and mostly unexamined, until the 1980s. However, {{research}} into tulip mania since then, especially by {{proponents of the}} efficient-market hypothesis, suggests that his story was incomplete and inaccurate. In her 2007 scholarly analysis Tulipmania, Anne Goldgar states that the phenomenon was limited to [...] "a fairly small group", and that most accounts from the period [...] "are based <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> contemporary pieces of propaganda and a prodigious amount of plagiarism". Peter Garber argues that the bubble [...] "was {{no more than a}} meaningless winter drinking game, played by a plague-ridden population that made use of the vibrant tulip market." ...|$|E

[...] Scouts saw what The New York Times later described as [...] "a smart passer with a flawed jump shot and a thin frame, who might not have the strength and athleticism to defend, create his own shot or finish at the rim in the N.B.A." [...] Lin joined the Dallas Mavericks for mini-camp {{as well as their}} NBA Summer League team in Las Vegas. Donnie Nelson of the Mavericks was the only General Manager who offered him an invitation to play in the Summer League. [...] "Donnie took care of me," [...] said Lin.

500|$|Unlike the band's three {{previous}} albums, {{most of the}} songs on Spiritual Machines were written solely by Maida. “I think that because this record happened quickly, we just ended up using {{a lot more of}} my songs this time,” stated Maida. “Whatever happens, happens, and if there are good ideas lying around, we use them.” Also unlike on their previous albums, this one was recorded sporadically piece by piece with songs being added as others were discarded. Raine had made several vocal demos at his new home recording studio before the Spiritual Machines idea had come into play. Many of these demos were used for the final recordings and Raine was given production credits. “It was more a means to an end." [...] he explained, [...] "I would start off with a 4-track, then move to an 8-track, then go to digital. I have a ProTools system set up in my basement, so I just try to finish songs and {{get them out of the}} way so I don’t build up this backlog of ideas. We just sift through that stuff, as well as the stuff we do in rehearsal and just pick the best ideas and go. It wasn't like I said I wanted to be a producer or anything, it’s just that the demos I was making came closer to the finished product <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>or</b> <b>two</b> occasions, so now, I’m a producer.” ...|$|E
