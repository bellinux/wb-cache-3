5|$|Jellyfish stings killed about 1,500 {{people in}} the 20th century, and cubozoans are {{particularly}} dangerous. On the other hand, some large jellyfish are considered a delicacy in East and Southeast Asia. Coral reefs have long been economically important as providers of fishing grounds, protectors of shore buildings against currents and tides, and more recently as centers of tourism. However, they are vulnerable to <b>over-fishing,</b> mining for construction materials, pollution, and damage caused by tourism.|$|E
5|$|One ctenophore, Mnemiopsis, has accidentally been {{introduced}} into the Black Sea, where it is blamed for causing fish stocks to collapse by eating both fish larvae and organisms that would otherwise have fed the fish. The situation was aggravated by other factors, such as <b>over-fishing</b> and long-term environmental changes that promoted {{the growth of the}} Mnemiopsis population. The later accidental introduction of Beroe helped to mitigate the problem, as Beroe preys on other ctenophores.|$|E
5|$|The calcium {{carbonate}} or silica spicules of most sponge genera make them too rough for most uses, but two genera, Hippospongia and Spongia, have soft, entirely fibrous skeletons. Early Europeans used soft sponges for many purposes, including padding for helmets, portable drinking utensils and municipal water filters. Until {{the invention of}} synthetic sponges, they were used as cleaning tools, applicators for paints and ceramic glazes and discreet contraceptives. However, by the mid-20th century, <b>over-fishing</b> brought both the animals and the industry close to extinction.|$|E

5|$|Economic {{development}} in Sitakunda is largely {{driven by the}} Dhaka-Chittagong Highway and the railway. Though Sitakunda is predominantly an agricultural area, {{it also has the}} largest ship breaking industry in the world. The industry has been accused of neglecting workers' rights, especially concerning work safety practices and child labor. It has also been accused of harming the environment, particularly by causing soil contamination. Sitakunda's ecosystems are further threatened by deforestation, <b>over-fishing,</b> and groundwater contamination. The upazila is also susceptible to natural hazards such as earthquakes, cyclones, and storm surges. It lies {{on one of the most}} active seismic faults in Bangladesh, the Sitakunda–Teknaf fault.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} part, titled Payback, Atwood {{examines}} ecological debt. She recounts {{the journey of}} Scrooge in A Christmas Carol but placed in a modern setting. The modern-day Scrooge is visited by the spirits of Earth Day. In the past Scrooge witnesses debts to nature being repaid through animal and human sacrifices and through pestilence in over-crowded or unsustainable populations. In the present Scrooge witnesses current unsustainable practices, <b>over-fishing</b> and deforestation, creating a debt to nature being repaid through effects on the climate and impacts on people. Finally, in the future, Scrooge is shown two versions: one, an eco-friendly human society balanced with environmental systems, and the other, a dystopian future with a disaster affecting the fuel or food resources {{in such a way}} that hyperinflation sets in and renders money useless.|$|E
5|$|Beaches {{protected}} from tides and storms by coral reefs {{are often the}} best places for housing in tropical countries. Reefs are an important food source for low-technology fishing, both on the reefs themselves and in the adjacent seas. However, despite their great productivity, reefs are vulnerable to <b>over-fishing,</b> {{because much of the}} organic carbon they produce is exhaled as carbon dioxide by organisms at the middle levels of the food chain and never reaches the larger species that are of interest to fishermen. Tourism centered on reefs provides much of the income of some tropical islands, attracting photographers, divers and sports fishermen. However, human activities damage reefs in several ways: mining for construction materials; pollution, including large influxes of fresh water from storm drains; commercial fishing, including the use of dynamite to stun fish and the capture of young fish for aquariums; and tourist damage caused by boat anchors and the cumulative effect of walking on the reefs. Coral, mainly from the Pacific Ocean has long been used in jewellery, and demand rose sharply in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Not {{only the}} land {{but also the}} sea is within the {{protection}} of the National Park. Fishing is extremely limited in order to allow the regeneration of fish shoals that had been severely <b>over-fished.</b> According to tradition, the Mediterranean monk seal (Monachus albiventur) once lived among these islands. The name of the southernmost point on Vela Kurka (Mendo) is connected with this almost extinct species.|$|R

So {{they feel that the}} target species are already <b>over-fished.</b> We suggest that proper management action, alternative ways of income generation and the payment of job insurance would help to mitigate the problem...|$|R
25|$|This {{decision}} {{sparked a}} major {{controversy in the}} Pacific fisheries and research community, which became divided along national lines. American William Thompson, head researcher for the IPSFC, was criticized by Canadian zoologist William Ricker who claimed that the IPSFC research was unreliable and that fishways were not a means to preserving Fraser salmon. Ricker believed that Hells Gate posed no threat to migrating salmon, and that commercial <b>over-fishing</b> did. He held that stringent regulations {{should be placed on}} fishing for Fraser salmon.|$|E
25|$|The {{flat-headed cat}} is {{primarily}} threatened by wetland and lowland forest destruction and degradation. Causes of this destruction include human settlement, forest transformation to plantations, draining for agriculture, pollution, and excessive hunting, wood-cutting and fishing. In addition, clearance of coastal mangroves {{over the past}} decade has been rapid in tropical Asia. The depletion of fish stocks from <b>over-fishing</b> is prevalent in many Asian wetland environments and {{is likely to be a}} significant threat. Expansion of oil palm plantations is currently viewed as the most urgent threat.|$|E
25|$|The natural {{heritage}} of Brazil is severely threatened by cattle ranching and agriculture, logging, mining, resettlement, {{oil and gas}} extraction, <b>over-fishing,</b> wildlife trade, dams and infrastructure, water pollution, climate change, fire, and invasive species. In {{many areas of the}} country, the natural environment is threatened by development. Construction of highways has opened up previously remote areas for agriculture and settlement; dams have flooded valleys and inundated wildlife habitats; and mines have scarred and polluted the landscape. At least 70 dams are said to be planned for the Amazon region, including the controversial Belo Monte hydroelectric dam.|$|E

25|$|The Nivkh {{suffered}} {{heavily from}} foreign influences, {{the first of}} which was the migration of the Tungusic peoples. Later, Qing China forced the Nivkh to pay tribute to them. In the 1850s–1860s, Cossacks of the Russian Empire annexed and colonized Nivkh lands, where they are a small, often neglected, minority today. Today, the Nivkh live in Russian-style housing and with the <b>over-fishing</b> and pollution of the streams and seas, they have adopted many foods from Russian cuisine. The Nivkh practice shamanism, which is important for the winter Bear festival, though some have converted to Russian Orthodoxy.|$|E
25|$|The {{two sides}} to this dispute each {{advocated}} for different remedial action. Thompson argued that environmental factors were {{to blame for the}} decline of Pacific salmon, and that the best remedy was to repair the damage to the migration pathway. Ricker believed that <b>over-fishing</b> was the primary threat to the Fraser salmon run, {{and that it would be}} a “gamble” to rely solely on the fishways as a means of conservation. Instead stringent regulations should be placed on salmon fishing, lest they be threatened by over fishing. Further, he feared that conservationists and fishers alike may take the construction of the fishways as an excuse to relax their vigilance, which would consequently threaten the survival of the Fraser salmon.|$|E
25|$|Sports {{fishermen}} travelled to {{the area}} {{as early as the}} 1880s, especially after the tales from noted anglers such as Sir Richard Musgrave and Sir John Rogers. The formation of the Campbell River Tyee Club in 1924, over concern regarding <b>over-fishing</b> of the salmon stocks, actually served to increase the popularity of the area. E.P. Painter, for instance, moved to Campbell River the following year and opened his Painter's Lodge in 1929. Painter's Lodge attracted clientele from Hollywood and regular patrons included Bob Hope and Bing Crosby. Commercial fishing was a large industry for many years. The town's magistrate Roderick Haig-Brown purchased a fishing cabin on Campbell River and wrote a number of books on fly fishing that are influential and well-loved around the world for both sport fishermen and conservationists.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Worldwide Fund, {{the only}} Hake species not {{currently}} <b>over-fished</b> is Cape hake, found in Namibia. [...] Namibia {{is the only}} country that has increased its hake quota, from 130,000 tonnes in 2009 to 145,000 tonnes in 2010. Furthermore, the Local Ministry of Fisheries adheres to very strict rules regarding the catch of hake. For example, the closed seasons for hake lasts approximately two months, September and October, depending on the level of stock. This rule has been applied to ensure the regrowth of the hake population. Supplemental restrictions include forbidding trawling for Hake in less than 200 m depth (to avoid damaging non-target species habitat)and minimizing by-catch.|$|R
40|$|Inshore {{fisheries}} in American Samoa {{have always been}} an important natural resource. In the past village leaders had the responsibility of regulating the use of reef areas adjacent to their villages. Because of the large, rapidly growing population, and a shift from a subsistence to a cash-based economy, traditional fisheries management practices are not as effective {{as they were in}} the past. The Department of Marine and Wildlife Resources of the American Samoa Government have had the powers and duties to protect and preserve the nearshore fisheries resources since 1986, and in 1990 issued fishing regulations concerning areas, activities, gears, and specific fisheries. Obvious inshore fisheries management problems include <b>over-fished</b> spiny lobster {Panulirus penicillatus) and giant clam (Tridacnidae) stocks. The regulations to preserve the spiny lobster fishery such as size limits and no berried females, may be ineffectual, gear restrictions such as no spearing or closed areas would be more effective. Slow growth rates of giant clams coupled with its high demand is probably responsible for its poor stock size, and DMWR has launched a clam hatchery program to mitigate this problem. Less distinct management problems include the bottomfish and coral reef fish fisheries. The bottomfish fishery is not <b>over-fished</b> at this time, but because there is very little bottomfish habitat, intensive fishing could deplete the stocks in a very short period of time. The coral reef fish fishery on Tutuila Island has decreased in total pounds landed and in CPUE by over 50 % in the past several years. This decrease is probably due to habitat degradation. A five-year fisheries plan was developed in 1994 to address these and other fisheries issues...|$|R

25|$|Argentine Patagonian cuisine {{is largely}} {{the same as}} the cuisine of Buenos Aires – grilled meats and pasta – with {{extensive}} use of local ingredients and less use of those products which have to be imported into the region. Lamb is considered the traditional Patagonian meat, grilled for several hours over an open fire. Some guide books have reported that game, especially guanaco and introduced deer and boar, are popular in restaurant cuisine. However, since the guanaco is a protected animal in both Chile and Argentina, it is unlikely to appear commonly as restaurant fare. Trout and centolla (king crab) are also common, though <b>over-fishing</b> of centolla has made it increasingly scarce. In the area around Bariloche, there is a noted Alpine cuisine tradition, with chocolate bars and even fondue restaurants, and tea rooms are a feature of the Welsh communities in Gaiman and Trevelin {{as well as in the}} mountains.

Out of [...] of cultivable land 25.46% yield a single crop, 57.95% yield double and 16.59% a treble crop annually. Bean, melon, rubber and betel leaf are the main agricultural exports. Fishing has traditionally been an industry restricted to low caste Hindus belonging to the fisher class, although since the last decades of the 20th century {{an increasing number of}} Muslims have joined the sector. Due to the introduction of engine-powered boats and gill nets, there was a rise in fish catches between the 1970s and 1990s, especially in the major fishing season (mid-July to mid-November). <b>Over-fishing,</b> however, has depleted the fish population and some fish species are facing extinction in the area, leading to seasonal food insecurity (February to April). According to a 2001 survey, 4,000 people in Sitakunda were engaged in wild shrimp fry collection, harvesting an average of five-and-a-half million fries a year.|$|E
