5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> became seizure-free, and another 35% <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a cohort <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who would generate better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E

Although research on patient satisfaction has become standard in many developed country, {{in countries such as}} Pakistan the concept <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction is still relatively neglected. This study aimed to find out the determinants <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction from existing literature in Pakistan. The literature search was carried out by using the database of Medscape, Medline, PakMedinet and PubMed, without any language restriction using MeSH words as “patient satisfaction AND health care system in Pakistan” and “Determinants <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction AND Pakistan”. Twenty-one articles were found which discussed the concept <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction and its determinants with health care system in Pakistan and other developing countries. Variable level <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> {{satisfaction with}} health care services was identified in literature review, more with private hospitals as compared to public hospitals and health care providers. Patient experiences and their expectations with health care services were found to be important determinant <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction in Pakistan. Young age, female gender, literacy and high social class are few patient characteristics influencing level <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction. In addition lack of privacy, autonomy, involvement in decision making, poor communication, and sanitation/hygiene leads to bad patient experience hence decreased satisfaction.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 39 - 41) This paper {{presents a}} study <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction conducted in an outpatient hematology-oncology clinic. The {{purpose of the}} study was to evaluate the existing practices of outpatient oncology care from the perspective of the consumer; that is, to make an assessment of care through the eyes <b>of</b> the <b>patient.</b> The methodology used in the patient satisfaction study included the use of a Likert-type scale attitude questionnaire, open-ended interviews, and participant observation. The fixed-choice questionnaire was intended to generate a quantitative measure <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction, while the interviews served to enrich the study <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction and to provide a check upon information secured through the questionnaire. In supplementing the questionnaire with interviews, the investigator was able to go beyond the face validity of the questionnaire results, giving depth and understanding to the statistical measurement <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction. Overall, the results of the study indicated a high level <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction with the staff and services of the oncology clinic. Statistical measures and qualitative measures <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction were compared to identify the areas of highest and lowest satisfaction. Also, a factor analysis was performed to discover whether variables of the attitude questionnaire could be reduced into a few dimensions. Based on the identified needs <b>of</b> the <b>patient</b> population <b>of</b> the outpatient oncology clinic obtained through the patient satisfaction study, specific recommendations are made for improvement of existing services. Future research in the area <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction is discussed, and implications are noted for the design <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction studies. Specifically, the results of this study are discussed in relation to the extent to which a measure <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction can provide valuable feedback and evaluation of on-going programs of health care. The study <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction is discussed as a tool for the health educator acting as change agent within the health care delivery system. This study <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> satisfaction with outpatient oncology care was intended to evaluate the existing practices for comprehensive outpatient cancer treatment, but equally important, this study demonstrated a means for health care delivery systems to be responsive to consumer needs...|$|R

Results The scoping literature review identified 67 articles that included a definition <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> empowerment. A range of diverse definitions <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> empowerment was extracted. Thematic analysis identified key underpinning themes, and these themes were used to develop an initial coding framework for analysis of interview data. 19 semi-structured interviews were conducted with key stakeholders. Transcripts were analysed using the initial coding framework, and findings were used to further develop the conceptual map. The resulting conceptual map describes that patient empowerment can be conceived as a state ranging across a spectrum from low to high levels <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> empowerment, with the level <b>of</b> <b>patient</b> empowerment potentially measurable using a set of indicators. Five key components of the conceptual map were identified: underpinning ethos, moderators, interventions, indicators and outcomes.
