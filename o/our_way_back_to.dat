6000|$|Dear good soldier, we are English ladies benighted, having mistaken [...] <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Salamanca, {{and we want}} {{shelter from}} the storm.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{would we}} had twenty ships like our own, Master Ned," [...] {{one of them}} said. [...] "That would give us four hundred men, and with those we could go ashore and hang the magistrates and the councillors and all who {{had a hand in}} this foul business, and set their public {{buildings}} in a flame, and then fight <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> again <b>to</b> the port." ...|$|R
60|$|On <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> I reverted <b>to</b> the {{one other}} subject {{which was now}} {{uppermost}} in my mind. I reiterated my resolution to discover why Eustace had not married me under the name that was really his own.|$|R
60|$|I was {{fortunate}} enough to find a disengaged omnibus, and filled it with our rugs and smaller belongings. Then we made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the little space prepared for the reception of the heavier baggage, and around which a barrier had already been erected. There was a slight nervousness in my companion's manner which made conversation difficult. I, too, could not help feeling that the situation was a difficult one for her.|$|R
6000|$|... "The shot told. Your aunt bounced up at once, and in {{ten minutes}} more was in my carriage, on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> London. There, sir, was not that generalship?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Come," [...] Mannering said at last. [...] "Let us make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house. If you are {{resolved}} {{to get back}} to town to-night, we ought to be thinking about luncheon." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the annals}} of history, the first {{inhabitants}} LABO were the Subanons. These Tribal Groups partly shaped our humble beginnings that of being a healthy Barangay. They owned big tracks of land which should have been fortunately handed down to their children, but because of fear and ignorance, they're forced to barter their lands to the new settlers with bolos, carpentry tools, and farm implements. They were forced to move out into the hinterlands where they have new farms and established a healthy and happy family. Bloodlines tells us that we inherited <b>our</b> <b>ways</b> tracing <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>our</b> forefathers. The Subanons, the healthy Filipino generation.|$|R
40|$|When {{it comes}} to ethics, it seems {{that we are all}} at sea. Since the beginning, the {{philosophers}} have always dreamed of finally reaching solid ground, but their proofs and demonstrations and laws have failed to bring us into harbour. Incapable of defining virtue, we manage to tell tales about it; not quite sure what justice is, we still spin yarns about the just and the unjust. Casting the reader adrift onto the sea of stories, attentive to the changes in the winds and the tides, through both philosophy and storytelling, this book explores ethics not as a means of finding <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> home <b>to</b> a safe harbour, but instead as a way of acclimatising ourselves to life on the seas of uncertainty...|$|R
50|$|Humans create spatial maps {{whenever}} they go somewhere. Neurons called place cells inside the hippocampus fire individually while a person makes {{their way through}} an environment. This was first discovered in rats, when the neurons of the hippocampus were recorded. Certain neurons fired whenever the rat was in a certain area of its environment. Theses neurons form a grid when they are all put together on the same plane. We get our sense of direction when we match up spatial maps we have stored in the hippocampus, to the pattern of firing neurons when we are trying <b>to</b> find <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> or trying <b>to</b> find our car in the parking lot.|$|R
60|$|As we made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the drawing-room, I {{was hoping}} for a talk with Dolly (alas! I should not have many more), when I heard a voice which sounded strangely familiar.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think we}} might as well be on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the ranch," [...] remarked Spouter. [...] "The sooner we get there and let our fathers know how matters stand, the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Leave him alone,' cried Saxon. 'The lad hath as {{much sense}} {{as any of}} ye. He will see which way the cat jumps. Come, friend, let us make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our men.' ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{the amazing}} and {{distressful}} discovery of every believer so {{soon as the}} first exaltation of belief is past, that one does not remain always in touch with God. At first it seems incredible that one should ever have any motive again that is not also God's motive. Then one finds oneself caught unawares by a base impulse. We discover that discontinuousness of our apparently homogeneous selves, the unincorporated and warring elements that seemed at first altogether absent from the synthesis of conversion. We are tripped up by forgetfulness, by distraction, by old habits, by tricks of appearance. There come dull patches of existence; those mysterious obliterations of one's finer sense that are due at times to the little minor poisons one eats or drinks, to phases of fatigue, ill-health and bodily disorder, or one is betrayed by some unanticipated storm of emotion, brewed deep in the animal being and released by any trifling accident, such as personal jealousy or lust, or one is relaxed by contentment into vanity. All these rebel forces of our ill-coordinated selves, all these [...] "disharmonies," [...] of the inner being, snatch us away from our devotion to God's service, carry us off to follies, offences, unkindness, waste, and leave us compromised, involved, and regretful, perplexed by a hundred difficulties we have put in <b>our</b> own <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> God.|$|R
60|$|But we are led <b>back</b> {{continually}} <b>to</b> {{the fact}} that science cannot, if it would, disengage itself from human nature and from imagination. No two men have ever argued together without at least agreeing in this, that something more than proof is required to produce conviction, and that a logic which is capable of grinding the stubbornest facts to powder (as every man's own logic always is) is powerless against so delicate a structure as the brain. Do what we will, we cannot contrive to bring together the yawning edges of proof and belief, to weld them into one. When Thor strikes Skrymir with his terrible hammer, the giant asks if a leaf has fallen. I need not appeal to the Thors of argument in the pulpit, the senate, and the mass-meeting, if they have not sometimes found the popular giant as provokingly insensible. The [sqrt of -x] is nothing {{in comparison with the}} chance-caught smell of a single flower which by the magic of association recreates for us the unquestioning day of childhood. Demonstration may lead to the very gate of heaven, but there she makes us a civil bow, and leaves us <b>to</b> make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> again <b>to</b> Faith, who has the key. That science which is of the intellect alone steps with indifferent foot upon the dead body of Belief, if only she may reach higher or see farther.|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The paper {{will discuss the}} {{phenomenology}} of drawing and how this may be useful for thinking about documenting and holding information, to provide aids when working with {{blind and visually impaired}} students. Drawing is said to be phenomenological: not only capable of recording its own making, but also the movement of the thoughts and body of the draftsman. Rosand (2002, p. 16) states, ‚ÄúResponding to drawings, we make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back,</b> through line, <b>to</b> the originary impulse of the draftsman. Interpretation involves a connecting act of re-creation, the self-projection of the viewer reimagining the process of drawing. ‚Äù Are these still viable claims when the visual element of the drawing is removed and replaced by touch? Working from the standpoint of Merleau-Ponty (2004) - who sought to identify the specific role of the body as mediator between the world and self - the paper will argue that they are and, as a consequence, drawing has the potential to enhance the documentation and transferring of information to the blind and visually impaired, through tactiles created from their own experiences of drawing through touch...|$|R

60|$|Much {{saddened by}} what I had seen, I took my {{departure}} from them, {{and the three}} of us made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the launch, accompanied by about five hundred men, women, girls, and boys.|$|E
