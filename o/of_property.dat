40|$|Article {{is devoted}} to {{theoretical}} analysis of nature and mechanism <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> insurance. Types <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> relations {{and its role in}} public reproduction are investigated. Peculiarities <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> relations are considered. Classification <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> objects depending on their most essential features is analyzed. Different approaches to classification <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> subjects are considered. Nature and preconditions of origin <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> insurance are investigated. Goals and functions <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> insurance are specified. Risks that related to disposal and commercialisation <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> and connected with peculiarities <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> objects and growing rate <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> rights infringements are analyzed. Three groups of risks concerning disposal and commercialization <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> objects are singled out: risks related to loss or abridgement <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> rights; risks related to possible losses, contingencies and half-received profits connected with commercialization <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> objects; risks <b>of</b> professional responsibility of participants <b>of</b> intellectual <b>property</b> market.

5|$|Panpsychism is {{the view}} that all matter has a mental aspect, or, alternatively, all objects have a unified center of {{experience}} or point of view. Superficially, {{it seems to be}} a form <b>of</b> <b>property</b> dualism, since it regards everything as having both mental and physical properties. However, some panpsychists say mechanical behaviour is derived from primitive mentality of atoms and molecules—as are sophisticated mentality and organic behaviour, the difference being attributed to the presence or absence of complex structure in a compound object. So long as the reduction of non-mental properties to mental ones is in place, panpsychism is not a (strong) form <b>of</b> <b>property</b> dualism; otherwise it is.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{argues that}} we have no good reason to accept any one theory <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> as correct. To show this, I present three possible bases for theory-choice in the properties debate: coherence, explanatory adequacy, and explanatory value. Then I argue that none of these bases resolve the underdetermination of our choice between theories <b>of</b> <b>properties.</b> ^ First, I argue considerations about coherence cannot resolve the underdetermination, because no traditional theory <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> is obviously incoherent. Second, I argue considerations of explanatory adequacy cannot resolve the underdetermination, because every traditional theory <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> lacks the theoretical resources to adequately explain resemblance, causal powers, and predication. However, these inadequacies are easily remedied with theoretical modifications. But this results in an overabundance of modified, but adequate, theories <b>of</b> <b>properties.</b> Third, I argue explanatory virtues cannot resolve the underdetermination, because {{we have no reason to}} think explanatory virtues make theories <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> more likely to be true. I reject the common argument that explanatory virtues are truth-conducive in theories <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> because they are truth-conducive in scientific theories. Since none of the three bases for theory choice can resolve the underdetermination, I conclude {{that we have}} no good reason to accept any one theory <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> as correct. ^ Finally, I consider the possibility of choosing one theory over the others on pragmatic grounds. But I argue that pragmatic grounds cannot resolve the underdetermination either. Instead, I suggest we accept the view I call `instrumental pluralism, 2 ̆ 7 which allows practitioners to use whatever theory <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> they find useful. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{underlying}} property, its definition, {{and representation}} {{play a major}} role when monitoring a system. Having a suitable and convenient framework to express properties is thus a concern for runtime analysis. It is desirable to delineate in this framework the sets <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> for which runtime analysis approaches can be applied to. This paper presents a unified view of runtime verification and enforcement <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> in the Safety-Progress classification. First, we extend the Safety-Progress classification <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> in a runtime context. Second, we characterize the set <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> which can be verified (monitorable properties) and enforced (enforceable properties) at runtime. We propose in particular an alternative definition of “property monitoring ” to the one classically used in this context. Finally, for the delineated sets <b>of</b> <b>properties,</b> we define specialized verification and enforcement monitors...|$|R
