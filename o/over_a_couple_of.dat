5|$|Paracetamol poisoning, {{also known}} as {{acetaminophen}} poisoning, is caused by excessive use of the medication paracetamol (acetaminophen). Most people have few or non-specific symptoms in the first 24hours following overdose. This may include feeling tired, abdominal pain, or nausea. This is typically followed {{by a couple of}} days without any symptoms after which yellowish skin, blood clotting problems, and confusion occurs. Additional complications may include kidney failure, pancreatitis, low blood sugar, and lactic acidosis. If death does not occur, people tend to recover fully <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks. Without treatment some cases will resolve while others will result in death.|$|E
5|$|Station to Station was {{recorded}} in late 1975 at Cherokee Studios, Los Angeles. In 1981, NME editors Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray surmised that it was cut—"in 10 days of feverish activity"—when Bowie decided {{that there was no}} hope of his producing a soundtrack for The Man Who Fell to Earth. More recent scholarship contends that the album {{was recorded}} <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> months—with the sessions beginning in late September or early October 1975 and ending in late November—so that it was in the can before Bowie began his abortive sessions on the soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|The 20-year-old newlywed {{was last}} seen at the Sawgrass Mills Mall where she worked at a {{sporting}} goods store. When she did not return home her husband went to the mall and found her car, a 1985 Ford Tempo, with the tires slashed. It is believed that Chandler, after scoping out the victim <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days, slashed the tires and {{showed up in the}} guise of a good samaritan and offered to help. Three hours after she was reported missing, her body was found under a residential mailbox, in a local neighborhood, by two men returning from a fishing trip.|$|E

5|$|Digging for Fire {{was based}} on a real {{incident}} in which Jake Johnson and his wife dug up a bone and a gun in the garden of a house they had rented. <b>Over</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks, he and a group of his friends dug up various objects before deciding to bury them again. Johnson described the experience to Joe Swanberg about three years later and they decided to make a film about it. They wrote a two-and-a-half–page outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue or detailed character descriptions. Swanberg wanted the actors to improvise the details of each scene and allowed them to make choices about their characters: for instance, Orlando Bloom decided that his character would ride a motorcycle, Chris Messina suggested that his character go swimming naked, and Brie Larson persuaded Johnson and Swanberg that her character would not be sexually attracted to Tim.|$|E

25|$|Spring Break Out – Taking {{place in}} the month of March, the Spring Break Out event welcomes the warm Texas weather with plenty of outdoor attractions, events, games, and concert performances. The event usually takes place <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks, {{allowing}} various local schools’ differing spring break holidays to coincide with one of the event's weeks.

25|$|Brown bear (grizzly) Ursus arctos horribilis (taqukaq, carayak Yup'ik and Cup'ik, paugnar in Cup'ig) and Black bear Ursus americanus (tan'gerliq in Yup'ik and Cup'ik, tungulzria in Cup'ig) were {{harvested}} {{for food}} (meat and fat). Bear meat (tan'gerlim kemga) made into jerky was often dried <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks time. The internal organs, such as heart, kidneys, and intestines were often distributed to elders. Both black and brown bear meat was considered very tasty and was prepared by drying, boiling, baking, and roasting. The bones were boiled {{so that all}} of the meat could easily be removed from them. The marrow was only occasionally used because the bones are very thick and not easily broken. The liver was considered to be too rich and was not eaten.|$|E
25|$|The Red Pike ridge {{occupies}} a broad area of high country between Nether Beck {{in the west}} and Mosedale in the east. The Mosedale face is steeper with considerable areas of Crag, whilst the western slopes descend slowly <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> miles. The ridge begins at an unnamed col to the southeast of Scoat Fell. This narrow depression is squeezed between Black Comb, the birthplace of Mosedale Beck, and Scoat Tarn, the primary feeder of Nether Beck. From the depression it is only a short climb to the summit of Red Pike, the majority of the ridge lying beyond on the long south easterly descent to Dore Head. At this col the watershed turns south west, rising to the twin summits of Yewbarrow. Dore Head is the source of Over Beck, the stream separating Yewbarrow from the long western flanks of Red Pike.|$|E

25|$|During the {{subsequent}} Swabian rule under the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, who {{spent most of}} his life as king of Sicily in his court in Palermo, the Islamic element was progressively eradicated until the massive deportation of the last Muslims of Sicily. As a result of Arab expulsion, many towns across Sicily were left depopulated. By the 12th century, Swabian kings granted immigrants from northern Italy (particularly Piedmont, Lombardy and Liguria), Latium and Tuscany in central Italy, and French regions of Normandy, Provence and Brittany (all collectively known as Lombards.) settlement into Sicily, re-establishing the Latin element into the island, a legacy which can be seen in the many Gallo-Italic dialects and towns found in the interior and western parts of Sicily, brought by these settlers. It is believed that the Lombard immigrants in Sicily <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> centuries were a total of about 200,000, a quite significant.|$|E
25|$|In {{some areas}} {{exploitation}} of the platform mounds became a cottage industry, as {{the value of the}} pots increased in demand on the art and antiquities markets. Many states as well as the US federal government now have laws prohibiting the looting of such sites, although the high prices these objects command on the black market has seen these laws ignored. Two of the most widely publicized sites to be looted were the Spiro Mounds site in Le Flore County, Oklahoma and the Slack Farm site in Union County, Kentucky. An actual mining company was formed (the Pocola Mining Company) to loot the Spiro site, and <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years time many of the more delicate contents were destroyed as the looters dynamited the mortuary mound to gain entrance to its interior. They dynamited the Great Mortuary of Spiro in 1934, and this destruction spurred preservationists to pass laws protecting American archaeological sites.|$|E

500|$|Gloucester's {{language}} acquisition was delayed: {{he did not}} speak correctly {{until the age of}} three, and consequently the commencement of his education was postponed by a year. The Reverend Samuel Pratt, a Cambridge graduate, was appointed the Duke's tutor in 1693. Lessons concentrated on geography, mathematics, Latin, and French. Pratt was an enemy of Jenkin Lewis, and they frequently disagreed over how Gloucester should be educated. Lewis remained Gloucester's favourite attendant because, unlike Pratt, he was knowledgeable in military matters and could therefore help him with his [...] "Horse Guards", a miniature army consisting of local children. <b>Over</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> years from 1693, the size of the army grew from 22 to over 90 boys.|$|E
500|$|Colin Greenwood {{admitted}} that the band, in attempting to make the disparate elements work together, [...] "felt like irresponsible schoolboys who were doing this... naughty thing, 'cause nobody does a six-and-a-half-minute song with all these changes. It's ridiculous". The song was at first intended to be humorous, and took its title from Marvin the Paranoid Android in Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy series of books. Yorke said the title [...] "was chosen as a joke. It was like, 'Oh, I'm so depressed.' And I just thought, that's great. That's how people would like me to be. And {{that was the end}} of writing about anything personal in the song. The rest of the song is not personal at all." [...] In an early interview, Colin Greenwood described it [...] "just a joke, a laugh, getting wasted together <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> evenings and putting some different pieces together". The band used Queen's [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody" [...] and the work of the Pixies as reference points while writing; yet Ed O'Brien denies they wrote [...] "a 'Bohemian Rhapsody' for the nineties", and Jonny Greenwood considers it too tense and simple to rival Queen's song.|$|E

2500|$|Cladribine can be {{administered}} by injection under the skin, by infusion <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hours into a vein, or by a pump {{worn by the}} patient that provides a slow drip into a vein, 24 {{hours a day for}} 7 days.

2500|$|Other, {{less common}} {{definitions}} rely on {{blood alcohol concentration}} (BAC). For example, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines the term [...] "binge drinking" [...] as a pattern of drinking that brings a person’s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 grams percent or above. [...] Whatever the numerical definition used, heavy drinking or rapid consumption over {{a short period of}} time with the intention of becoming intoxicated is often implied when the term is used colloquially, since four or five drinks consumed over the course of a whole day and as an accompaniment to meals will not have the same effects as the same amount consumed <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hours on an empty stomach.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of her second album Mistaken Identity in 2004, Delta {{reflected}} that the album was rushed – written and recorded {{while she was still}} recovering from chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Goodrem remarked that she felt overexposed and claimed, [...] "I'd burnt myself out. By the end of 'Mistaken Identity' I thought, 'This is nothing of what I am. I know I can do all of this a lot better'." [...] After a period of being angry, Delta felt she was healed and embraced herself and being in the public eye. Therefore, she started developing a new album, stating, [...] "For a while I was writing songs for this album I didn't want to talk about things, so I didn't want to write about them either. [...] "I had to get <b>over</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> things. My parents divorced, there was a lot going on. But now I truly am inspired again. I feel regenerated.
