50|$|He {{pursued a}} {{doctoral}} degree {{and served as}} a research assistant under Farlow from 1886 to 1888. During this period, Thaxter published an important Gymnosporangium paper, “On Certain Cultures of Gymnosporangium with Notes on their Roesteliae”, in which he described relationships between Gymnosporangium and Roestelia species. In 1888, Thaxter received the degrees of M.A. and Ph.D., with his thesis monographing “The Entomophthoreae of the United States”. From 1888 to 1891, he took a position as the first plant pathologist at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. He set up a third department in the Station and named it “Mycology”. During his brief time at the Station, his research led to valuable discoveries in Phytopathology. He described the pathogen of potato scab, Oospora scabies, the mildew of lima beans (Phytophthora phaseoli), the <b>onion</b> <b>smut</b> (Urocystis cepulae), and pioneered the use of fungicide sprays to control fungal diseases.|$|E

The three pathogens were not detected.

40|$|During {{the past}} two seasons several {{important}} destructive fungous diseases of cultivated plants have made their appearance in Iowa, namely: Timothy rust, alfalfa rust, apple canker, and <b>onion</b> <b>smut.</b> About the middle of July, 1910, there was an abundance of timothy rust in a meadow in the vicinity of Ames; subsequently it was reported from other localities in the state. It was again noticed after the September rains in 1911, especially in the timothy breeding plots...|$|E
40|$|OR YEARS MANY PROFESSIONAL plant {{scientists}} considered John Charles Walker {{to be one}} of the world’s greatest plant pathologists. Walker earned this reputation {{because of}} his high intellect, work ethic, and an unusual ability to scientifically assess plant disease problems and develop methods for their control. These control procedures almost always involved the practical application of his knowledge of and appreciation for related sciences, such as plant genetics, plant physiology, and biochemistry, which greatly benefited the vegetable growers and processors of our nation. They involved pioneering scientific achievements that scientists all over the world embraced and tried to emulate. His fundamental discoveries of plant disease resistance made a lasting impact on world agriculture. John Charles Walker was born on July 6, 1893, in Racine, Wisconsin. His father was a cabbage grower and seedsman. Young Walker attended the rural district school and then Racine High School, graduating in 1909. In 1910 he enrolled in the University of Wisconsin, and in 1914 his B. S. thesis on <b>onion</b> <b>smut</b> disease won the university’s Science Medal as the most outstanding thesis. For this honor his fellow graduates gave him a rousing cheer at commencement. H...|$|E
