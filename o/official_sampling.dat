40|$|The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has {{assessed}} {{data on the}} presence (prevalence) of salmonella in breeding poultry, broiler and turkey populations since 2008. It publishes its results each year. These reports {{are part of the}} EU-wide salmonella control programme. They are based on results from both the <b>official</b> <b>sampling</b> and own checks conducted by companies. The analysed data from the year 2011 document that compared to the preceding year, salmonella was detected in fewer production animal populations: for breeding hens, broilers as well as breeding and fattening turkeys, a prevalence of below 1 % was found for the control-relevant serovars. For laying hens, 2. 2 % of the flocks tested salmonella positive, i. e. 0. 4 % less than in the year 2010. This means that in Germany, the agreed EU goals for the reduction of salmonella presence was reached for all poultry groups covered by the control programme...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of anisakid larvae in fish {{is a public}} health issue, and effective risk management procedures are needed to avoid that heavily infected products reach the market. Currently, an <b>official</b> <b>sampling</b> plan for fresh fish defining sample size, inspection methods, and criteria to accept or reject the merchandise is lacking at the European and Italian level. In this study, we compared the visual inspection proposed by the sampling plan of the Lombardy Region (Italy) to the UV press method and to an optimized digestion procedure with the aim to assess its ability in detecting visible parasites. Thirty-one batches of Engraulis encrasicolus, each composed of ∼ 30 specimens, were collected and subsequently analyzed with the three techniques. The mean abundance (MA) was calculated after each procedure and compared {{on the basis of}} a threshold value. The results showed that the visual inspection performed similarly to the digestion method, with a sensitivity of 93...|$|E
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{changing}} environment in telephone surveys due to the recent increase of households with cell phones only, landline phone frames in many countries still {{play an important role}} in their sample designs to select representative populations. The studies on random digit dialing (RDD) landline frames, which were much influenced by the past developments of RDD sampling methods in the United States, have been conducted in some countries including the UK and Germany. However, RDD sampling methods have not reached the levels of use in the United States (Kalsbeek and Agans, 2008). In Korea, landline phone directory sampling has been mainly used to select samples of telephone households in social surveys or research for public policy as well as electoral polls. Until the mid- 2000 s, printed landline phone directories were used as <b>official</b> <b>sampling</b> frames because of a set of regulations designed to protect the private information of subscribers. Since then a commercial firm has begun providing elec-tronic telephone directories, and many survey research companies have used them to build their own databases of landline numbers to be used as national sampling frames...|$|E

40|$|The EU-wide {{salmonella}} {{control programme}} provides for all Member States to submit an annual {{report on the}} percentage of salmonella-positive flocks of breeding poultry (Gallus gal-lus), laying hens and broilers. To meet this requirement, all Länder (German federal states) submit their data to the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) which then evaluates the data. The data reported for 2009 show that the established Community targets for breeding poultry (1 %) and broilers (1 %) were either maintained or reached. In <b>official</b> <b>sampling,</b> salmonella serovars targeted in the control programmes were found in 0. 8 % of breeding poultry and in 0. 4 % of broilers. In laying hens, the detection rate for salmonella serovars targeted in the control programmes was 4. 8 %, which was {{higher than in the}} previous year. Changes in detection rates are also possibly the result of improved reporting. This supports the relevance of harmonised reporting for the consistent implementation and assessment of control programmes. If only the results from official testing are taken into account, the detection rate of the five salmonella serovars targeted in the control programmes in breeding poultry were below the Community target established for salmonella control and thus complied with the target, as they have in previous years. If, however, test results reported by food business operators are also taken into account the result appears differently. Under these circumstances, the sal-monella findings in laying hens clearly exceeded the Community target. Compared with the relatively low detection rates of the previous year, salmonella detection was not reduced further...|$|E
40|$|The European anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), one of {{the most}} {{important}} pelagic fish resources in the Mediterranean Sea, is frequently infected by anisakid larvae. Food Business Operators (FBOs) should use appropriate sampling plans and analytical methods to avoid commercialization of massively infected batches and reduce the risk of transmission of viable zoonotic larvae. In this study, performed at FishLab (Department of Veterinary Sciences of the University of Pisa) during 2016, an <b>official</b> <b>sampling</b> plan was associated with a digestion protocol for the inspection of anchovies. Considering that anisakid larvae are usually located in the fish visceral cavity and in the adjacent muscles (VM), this part was analyzed. In particular, we assessed the reliability of the digestion of a subsample of 150  g (±  30  g) of VM, randomly collected from 29 specimens, in estimating the marketability of the anchovies' batch. Fifty-seven samples of 29 anchovies were collected. Each anchovy was sectioned to separate VM. All the subsamples were digested, and visible larvae counted. A high correlation between the number of larvae in VM regions and in the total batch was observed, indicating a very significant contribution of the VM region on total number of parasites. The Mean Abundance (MA) was used to assess the batch marketability according to a threshold calculated on the basis of the maximum number of nematodes tolerated per sample. Considering that the MA can be calculated only when the number of examined specimens is known, the number of visible Larvae per gram of tissue (LpG) was calculated on 150  g (±  30  g) of VM subsamples. A LpG marketability threshold was calculated dividing the maximum number of tolerated nematodes by the average weight of a sample of 29 anchovies calculated considering data available in literature. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the LpG threshold, the marketability of 57 batches assessed on the basis of the MA threshold was assumed as the gold standard. The proposed LpG showed very high Specificity and Sensitivity. These findings suggest that the analysis of VM is representative of the overall infestation of the batch, both when considering the absolute number of parasites and the LpG, and may represent a valid alternative to the whole anchovy digestion. In particular, the use of an automated digestive method, coupled with the aforesaid sampling plan, could allow the procedure to be used by FBOs in operational conditions...|$|E
40|$|Consumers {{worldwide}} expect {{access to}} safe seafood products {{regardless of its}} origin. Each country judges imported products against its own residue and contaminant standards coupled with differing testing capability, sample collection, sample preparation and data reporting strategies. Australian exporters of finfish whether it is farmed or wild capture origin have to negotiate {{their way through a}} series of regulatory hurdles and gate keeper organisations in each market they wish to target. Detention or destruction of product at border control stations can occur if importing country standards are not met. This thesis outlines five separate case studies of how this has been successfully done with select high value Australian finfish species by tackling different issues of public health and market access concern The General Introduction provides an overview of the researched finfish species and introduces the key residues and contaminants addressed in this thesis. Chapter two introduces dioxins and PCBs data for single season grow- out farmed Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) SBT. The mean concentration of dioxins found was 0. 53 pg WHO TEQ/g (range 0. 2 - 1. 1) while the mean concentration of PCBs found was 32 µg/kg (range 13 - 55). Chapter three more comprehensively addresses single season grow-out farmed Australian SBT not just for dioxins and PCBs, but pesticides, antibiotics and metallic elements. Japanese port of entry <b>official</b> <b>sampling</b> methods are discussed. The mean concentration of dioxins in wild SBT was 0. 14 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 07 - 0. 32) and in farmed SBT was 0. 2 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 06 - 0. 8). The mean concentration of the sum of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in wild SBT was 0. 27 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 18 - 0. 45) and in farmed SBT was 1 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 2 - 4). Mean PCB concentration in wild SBT was 0. 13 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 1 - 0. 21) and in farmed SBT was 0. 8 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 17 - 3. 5). Mean PCB total concentration in wild SBT was 0. 47 µg/kg (range 0. 4 - 0. 6) and in farmed SBT was 6. 6 µg/kg (range 0. 8 - 41). The mean concentration of total mercury in wild SBT was 0. 34 mg/kg (range 0. 28 - 0. 42) and in farmed SBT was 0. 31 mg/kg (range 0. 18 - 0. 45). There were no detectable levels of any pesticide or antimicrobial compounds in any sample of SBT. Chapter four introduces farmed Yellowtail Kingfish (Seriola lalandi) YTKF and Mulloway (Argyrosomus hololepidotus). Data on dioxins, PCBs, pesticides, veterinary medicines and metallic elements are presented and discussed in terms of Australia, Japanese and European regulatory standards. The mean concentration of dioxins in YTKF was 0. 6 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 22 - 0. 8) and in Mulloway was 0. 16 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 16 - 0. 16). The mean concentration of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs in the YTKF was 2. 6 pg TEQ/g (range 1. 4 - 3. 5), while the Mulloway had a mean concentration of 0. 67 pg TEQ/g (range 0. 57 - 0. 76). The mean concentration of PCBs in YTKF was 21 µg/kg (range 8. 6 - 29) and in Mulloway was 5. 4 µg/kg (mean 4. 7 - 6). The mean concentration of dioxin-like PCBs in YTKF was 2. 1 pg TEQ/g (range 1. 2 - 2. 8) and in Mulloway was 0. 51 pg TEQ/g (Range 0. 41 - 0. 61). The mean mercury concentration in YTKF was 0. 03 mg/kg (range 0. 02 - 0. 05) and in Mulloway it was 0. 023 mg/kg (range 0. 02 - 0. 04). There were no detectable levels of any pesticide or antimicrobial compounds in any sample of YTKF or Mulloway. Chapter five addresses total mercury content in wild Australian SBT. Results are discussed in terms of international regulatory standards and compared with bluefin tunas available in the Japanese market. Mean total mercury concentration was 0. 43 mg/kg (range 0. 24 - 0. 72). A dietary exposure assessment found that pregnant women and women planning pregnancy could consume one 150 g serving per week, the rest of Australian general adult population could consume up to three 150 g servings per week and children (up to 6 years) could consume one 75 g serving of Australian wild SBT per week. Chapter six investigates total mercury content of canned wild Skipjack Tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) products. The mean total mercury content found in 2005 was 0. 10 mg/kg (range 0. 07 - 0. 15) and in 2006 was 0. 09 mg/kg (range 0. 02 - 0. 22). Testing of condiment canning ingredients identified low levels of mercury in black pepper and cinnamon. A dietary exposure assessment found that pregnant women and women planning pregnancy could consume seven 150 g servings per week, {{while the rest of the}} Australian adult general population could consume up to 14 150 g servings per week and children (up to 6 years) could consume eight 75 g servings of these canned tuna products per week. The use of fixed body weight values in exposure assessments may bias results when compared to actual current body weight values of the Australian population. These issues are discussed in conjunction with the inability of consumers to readily identify low mercury content tuna species from back of packaging labelling. Chapter seven describes the causes of detentions and rejections of Australian seafood products in international trade. On a numerically basis, cadmium in Australian crustaceans is ranked the highest notification category. However, caution is urged when assessing these lists without access to qualifying information on frequency of testing, number of tests undertaken, sampling methodology, laboratory analytical techniques and reporting basis. Standards in each notification instance are compared between the importing country and those in Australia. Fish names are discussed and their application to identification of product in trade is highlighted. The General Discussion summarises outcomes of research covered in this thesis and identifies future product integrity research needs and priorities for the Australian seafood industry to meet current and future market access needs...|$|E

Flunixin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug approved for use in horses, was administered to eight mares in five consecutive daily doses of 1. 1 mg per kilogram of body weight by the IM or IV route. Flunixin was detected in urine samples collected at various times after drug administration by flunixin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) methods. Detection me was defined as the time period over which flunixin was detected and was dependent on the method used. The shortest detection times were 24 to 48 h and were observed when the TIC method was used. On the other hand, detection times were as long as 15 days when HPLC, GC-MS, and flunixin ELISA methods were used.
