As the Israelis {{expected}} the attack to begin four hours later, <b>only</b> <b>part</b> {{of the troops}} {{and none of the}} armor assigned to man the Bar Lev Line were in position, except for a few platoons in the northernmost forts. Sixteen fortifications on the line were fully manned, and another two were partially manned.|$|E
5|$|Camp {{meetings}} at the Mountain Grove Campground was held for seven to ten days each August. Several thousand people would attend the camp each year. By 1878, campground attendance on Saturdays had reached 4000 to 5000 people. The percentage of attendees who stayed for the whole duration of the camp meeting, as opposed to <b>only</b> <b>part</b> of it, also decreased during the 1890s.|$|E
5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} seen by Llwyd, Jones and Glynne was {{demolished}} {{and the present}} structure was erected, designed by Henry Kennedy, architect of the Diocese of Bangor. The <b>only</b> <b>part</b> of the old church to survive was some of the stonework {{at the base of}} the west wall. Some repair work was carried out in 1956.|$|E

5|$|Stylistic {{comparisons}} with other works by Bach {{suggest that the}} same poet wrote the texts for both audition cantatas and also for the two first cantatas which Bach performed when taking up his office. The poetry for the second aria has an unusually long first section, which Bach handled elegantly by repeating <b>only</b> <b>part</b> {{of it in the}} da capo.|$|E
5|$|The film's idea {{resulted}} from a small scale exercise between Nemescu and Liviu Marghidan {{when they were in}} university in 2003. The original idea belonged to Cătălin Mitulescu and Andreei Vălean; the <b>only</b> <b>part</b> of the original story that was kept is that of a group of boys trying to steal a trolleybus {{in order to get to}} some prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|Wind's view of Wodehouse's naïveté is {{not universally}} held. Biographers {{including}} Donaldson, McCrum and Phelps suggest that his unworldliness was <b>only</b> <b>part</b> {{of a complex}} character, and that in some respects he was highly astute. He was unsparing of the studio owners in his early-1930s short stories set in Hollywood, which contain what Taves considers Wodehouse's sharpest and most biting satire.|$|E

5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, <b>only</b> <b>part</b> of the Sun is obscured.|$|E
5|$|According {{to another}} legend, {{there was once}} a sea where the Dnieper River now flows. When Saint Andrew came to Kiev and erected a cross on the place where the Saint Andrew's Church now stands, the sea went away. The <b>only</b> <b>part</b> that {{remained}} of the sea is under the mountain on which Kiev sits today. When the church was built there in the 18th century, a spring opened under the altar. The church has no bells, because, according to the legend, when the first bell strikes, the water can revive again and flood the left bank of Kiev.|$|E
5|$|At {{present the}} most {{informative}} sequence of dinosaur-bearing {{rocks in the}} world from the K–Pg boundary is found in western North America, particularly the late Maastrichtian-age Hell Creek Formation of Montana. This formation, when compared with the older (approximately 75Ma) Judith River/Dinosaur Park Formations (from Montana and Alberta respectively) provides information on the changes in dinosaur populations over the last 10million years of the Cretaceous. These fossil beds are geographically limited, covering <b>only</b> <b>part</b> of one continent.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the North Korean invasion, the closest American ground force was the 24th Infantry Division, which was based in Japan. This {{division}} had fewer than its normal contingent of soldiers, and most of its equipment was rather old due to the U.S. Congress's reductions in military spending. In any case, the 24th Infantry Division was the <b>only</b> <b>part</b> of the U.S. Army that was available to quickly reinforce South Korea.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the closure}} of the {{original}} London tram network in 1952, Holborn provided an interchange between trams and tubes, via the underground Holborn tramway station located a little distance south of the underground railway station. This was the <b>only</b> <b>part</b> of London with an underground tram system, and Holborn tramway station (named Great Queen Street when first opened) is still extant beneath ground, though with no public access.|$|E
5|$|Both sides claimed victory {{after the}} battle, with the JNA hailing the {{evacuation}} of the garrison as its greatest success. However, they achieved <b>only</b> <b>part</b> of their objectives; the JNA failed to secure the area surrounding the barracks or remove all the weapons and equipment in it, and the planned coordinated advance against Turanj also failed. Croatian forces failed in their primary objective: containing the garrison. Nonetheless, the JNA threat from the Logorište barracks was removed (freeing up forces assigned to the blockade of the barracks) {{and a large number}} of weapons were captured.|$|E

5|$|By 1892, Imaginos {{is living}} in a mansion in Cornwall and has a nine-year-old granddaughter. Having by this time spent several decades {{studying}} mysticism and astrology, Imaginos discovers that Elizabethan England's rise as a superpower coincided with John Dee's acquisition of a magic obsidian mirror from Mexico, {{which serves as a}} bridge between Les Invisibles' alien world and ours, and the means to spread their influence on Earth. Some fans see Les Invisibles' actions in favour of England against Spain as a sort of vengeance for the extermination by the conquistadores of their worshippers in Central America, while others view their intervention as <b>only</b> <b>part</b> of the mysterious scheme carried on by the alien entities through the centuries ("In the Presence of Another World").|$|E
5|$|Deptford borders {{the areas}} of Brockley and Lewisham to the south, New Cross {{to the west and}} Rotherhithe to the north west; Deptford Creek divides it from Greenwich to the east, and the River Thames {{separates}} the area from the Isle of Dogs to the north east; it is contained within the London SE8 post code area. The area referred to as North Deptford is the <b>only</b> <b>part</b> of the London Borough of Lewisham to front the Thames and is sandwiched between Rotherhithe and Greenwich. Much of this riverside estate is populated by the former Naval Dockyards, now known as Convoys Wharf, the Pepys Estate and some eastern fringes of the old Surrey Commercial Docks.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of the second road bridge, {{the construction}} of a railway through Perth's southern suburbs to Rockingham and Mandurah became a political issue. The incumbent Liberal State Government proposed building a railway from Kenwick to connect to the Kwinana Freeway, running in the centre of the freeway for <b>only</b> <b>part</b> of its journey. The Labor opposition instead wanted to build the railway across the Narrows Bridge and down most of the length of the freeway.|$|E

5|$|Each section, such as on {{reptiles}} at {{the start}} of Volume II (and the entire work) is introduced with an essay on distinguishing aspects of their zoology. In the case of the reptiles, the essay begins with the observation that their circulation is so arranged that <b>only</b> <b>part</b> of the blood pumped by the heart goes through the lungs; Cuvier discusses the implications of this arrangement, next observing that they have a relatively small brain compared to the mammals and birds, and that none of them incubate their eggs.|$|E
5|$|El Toro {{has several}} {{similarities}} to Viper, the coaster that it replaced. The most obvious similarity is that El Toro uses Viper's station, the <b>only</b> <b>part</b> of Viper {{that was not}} torn down. The station previously held two Viper trains at once, with a loading platform {{in the front and}} an unloading platform in the rear. The ramp that was previously Viper's main exit is now used only for wheelchair access, as El Toro has a new exit {{on the other side of}} the station. During El Toro's construction, the station was gutted and an entirely new platform built. Like El Toro, Viper turned left out of the station before the lift hill and turned left at the top of the lift before the first drop.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, Clark {{was chosen}} to fill the congressional seat vacated by Henry Clay's {{elevation}} to Secretary of State. He served until 1831, but did not seek re-election that year. He became active in organizing the Whig Party in Kentucky and was rewarded for his efforts by being chosen as the party's nominee for governor in 1836. He won the election and laid out an ambitious platform to the legislature, which acted on <b>only</b> <b>part</b> of it. Clark's most significant accomplishment as governor was securing {{the creation of a}} state board of education and the establishment of public schools in every county in the state. Clark died in office in 1839. His estate, Holly Rood, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.|$|E
