This paper takes on a holistic approach that examines the combined effects of customer processes (Customer Relation, Customer attraction, Customer Knowledge Capture and Customer data Analysis) on customer acquisition. Drawing on this, the framework develops several hypotheses regarding the main interaction effects of customer processes on customer acquisition. Testing of these hypotheses is based on a sample of the data collected from two hundred respondents, drawn randomly from four Jordanian Banks working in the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) area. The results of the survey show that the four selected factors (Customer Relation, Customer attraction, Customer Knowledge Capture and Customer data Analysis) {{have a significant impact on}} customer acquisition. Additionally, the Quantitative evidence from the survey offers further support for this finding. The emerging empirical findings will certainly help both researchers and practitioners in future customer process and Customer acquisition research.
