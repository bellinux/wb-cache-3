5|$|Each driver {{cell in the}} LIFE {{baseline}} design contained two of the high-density diode arrays arranged <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a large slab {{of laser}} glass. The arrays were provided cooling via hook-up pipes {{at either end of}} the module. The initial laser pulse was provided by a preamplifier module similar to the one from the NIF, the output of which was switched into the main beamline via a mirror and Pockel's cell optical switch. To maximize the energy deposited into the beam from the laser glass, optical switches were used to send the beam to mirrors to reflect the light through the glass four times, in a fashion similar to NIF. Finally, focussing and optical cleanup was provided by optics <b>on</b> <b>either</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the glass, before the beam exited the system through a frequency converter at one end.|$|E
