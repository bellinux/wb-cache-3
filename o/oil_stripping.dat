30|$|In oil-wet porous media, {{residual}} oil {{is attached to}} the rock surface {{in the form of a}} continuous oil film. Wang et al. (2000) reported the velocity profile of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids in capillary tubes and observed that the velocity gradient near the capillary wall for elastic fluids is considerably greater than for Newtonian fluids. Therefore, a stronger force is produced during flow of polymer solutions as compared to water, enhancing stripping oil films off the rock surface which eventually leads to a promotion of oil displacement efficiency (Jiang et al. 2008; Xia et al. 2004, 2008 b; Wang 2001; Wang et al. 2001 c; Sedagha et al. 2013).

40|$|Evidence that dietary {{lycopene}} {{decreases the}} risk {{for a number of}} health conditions has generated new opportunities for the addition of lycopene to functional foods. This work examined the potential of oil-in-water emulsions as a lycopene delivery system for foods. Oil-in-water emulsions containing lycopene were prepared using different kinds of surfactant (cationic, anionic, and nonionic) and oil types (corn <b>oil,</b> <b>stripped</b> corn <b>oil,</b> and hexadecane). The formation of fatty acid oxidation products and the degradation of lycopene and tocopherol were then monitored. Fatty acids and lycopene had greater stability in oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by cationic dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) or nonionic polyoxyethylene (23) lauryl ether than by anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Oxidative stability in the corn oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by SDS was in the following order: tocopherol 3 ̆c lycopene 3 ̆c fatty acids. When emulsions were prepared using different carrier oils, the lycopene stability was in the following order: nonstripped corn oil 3 ̆e hexadecane 3 ̆e tocopherol-stripped corn oil. Lycopene degradation rates were similar in emulsions with and without fatty acids, suggesting that lycopene loss was independent of the presence of fatty acids. These results suggest that the stability of lycopene in oil-in-water emulsions could be inhibited by altering the emulsion droplet interface and by the presence of tocopherols...|$|R
40|$|Deficiency {{of vitamin}} A {{has long been}} {{recognized}} as a serious and preventable nutritional disease.   Various intervention strategies have been implemented to combat the problem.   Massive dosing of the vitamin {{has the advantage of}} immediate implementation but suffers from the disadvantage in that it applies to the isolated nutrient and requires repetitive administration. Natural food sources regularly included in diets offer a more viable long term solution. Red palm oil (RPO) can emerge as a viable alternative to other vitamin A rich foods, since it contains enormous amounts of natural carotenoids to the tune of around 700 PPM, the predominant ones being a and b carotene which have the highest biological potential for vitamin A conversion.   Value addition of palm oil for edible purposes results in several nutritionally rich products like edible grade red palm oil (RPO), deacidified, deodourised RPOlein, isolated carotenoids and refined, bleached and deodourized palmolein oil RBD palmolein). RBD palmolein oil can serve as a replacement for any other commonly used edible oil, but has little additional advantage over other edible <b>oils,</b> <b>stripped</b> of its carotenoids. However, it’s naturally rich composition of tocopherols and tocotrienols, as well as the balanced fatty acid composition, makes it more superior to other edible oils used for dietary purposes. Addition of RBD palmolein to hydrogenated vegetable oil confers no advantage, and paradoxically, decreases it’s beneficial properties making it a more harmful vegetable oil from the cardiovascular health angle, because of conversion of fatty acids from the cis to trans type. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This work {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the simultaneous extraction and stripping of Cu(II) from aqueous solutions through a soybean oil-based bulk liquid membrane (BLM). The membrane phase used was soybean oil (diluent) loaded with di- 2 -ethylhexylphosphoric acid (carrier) and tributylphosphate (phase modifier), whereas the stripping phase was sulphuric acid (H 2 SO 4) at various concentrations. Effects of stirring condition, strip to feed interface area (S:F) ratio, H 2 SO 4 concentration and operating time on Cu(II) extraction and stripping through soybean oil-based BLM were investigated. It was found that stirring affected the extraction process significantly but showed relatively smaller effect on the stripping process. The other parameters such as S:F ratio, H 2 SO 4 concentration and operating time, however, were found to control the stripping process more than the extraction process. The highest extraction (98 %) and stripping (86 %) were achieved by using soybean oil-based BLM with four stirrings for all phases, S:F ratio of 2. 5 : 1 and 3 M H 2 SO 4 as the stripping phase within 24 h of operating time. Application of soybean oil-based BLM in real industrial wastewater was also investigated.

40|$|The {{antioxidant}} {{activity and}} interactions with copper of four olive oil phenolic compounds, namely oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, 3, 4 - dihydroxyphenylethanol- elenolic acid (1), and 3, 4 - dihydroxyphenyl-ethanolelenolic acid dialdehyde (2), {{in olive oil}} and oil- in- water emulsions stored at 60 degrees C were studied. All four phenolic compounds significantly extended the induction time of lipid oxidation in olive oil with the order of activity being hydroxytyrosol > compound 1 > compound 2 > oleuropein > alpha- tocopherol; but {{in the presence of}} Cu(II), the stability of oil samples containing phenolic compounds decreased by at least 90 %, and the antioxidant activity of hydroxytyrosol and compounds 1 and 2 became similar. In oil- in- water emulsions prepared from olive <b>oil</b> <b>stripped</b> of tocopherols, hydroxytyrosol enhanced the prooxidant effect of copper at pH 5. 5 but not at pH 7. 4. The stability of samples containing copper at pH 5. 5 was not significantly different if oleuropein was present from that of the control. Oleuropein at pH 7. 4, and compounds 1 and 2 at both pH values tested, reduced the prooxidant effect of copper. The lower stability and the higher reducing capacity of all compounds at pH 7. 4 could not explain the higher stability of emulsions containing phenolic compounds at this pH value. However, mixtures containing hydroxytyrosol or oleuropein with copper showed higher 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 - picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity at pH 7. 4 than at pH 5. 5. Moreover, the compound 2 - copper complex showed higher radical scavenging activity then the uncomplexed compound at pH 5. 5.

Ethanolic extracts exhibited the highest total phenolics contents and Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values on a per gram of extract basis, and hot water extracts, the lowest (ethanolic extraction > SWE 110 °C > SWE 160 °C > hot water extraction). Extraction pressure (3. 44 - 6. 89 MPa) {{had no effect on}} the yields, total phenolics contents or TEAC values of extracts from SWE. The use of buffered water (pH 2 - 8) for SWE increased extract yield but had adverse effects on the total phenolics contents and TEAC values of extracts.

40|$|Oil palm is {{the largest}} {{national}} crop produced in Papua New Guinea. It is grown on over 80, 000 ha of young volcanic soils in five Provinces, employs over 12, 000 workers and uses > 12, 000 tonnes of fertiliser to offset nitrogen deficiency {{which is the most}} limiting factor to production. <b>Oil</b> palms <b>strip</b> out 160 - 200 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1 from the soil. Nitrogen fertilisers account for 60 - 70 % of all variable production costs but 40 - 60 % of applied fertiliser cannot be accounted for. Few studies have investigated the amounts of nitrogen lost via leaching, denitrification, volatilisation or as surface runoff in tropical soils and none have been done in Papua New Guinea. Oil palm soils typically have extremely high infiltrabilities (80 - 8, 500 mm hr- 1) and receive high annual rainfall which throughfall makes spatially non-uniform. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess and quantify nitrogen losses and suggest strategies that might assist in reducing them and their impact on the environment. The modest facilities available at the two research sites, West New Britain (Dami) and Oro (Sangara) Provinces, meant that no analytical work could be done on-site, so simple but appropriate methods were used to evaluate losses, with samples collected, preserved and sent off-shore for analysis. Large four-palm plots were used to evaluate runoff; a gas trap was used to collect evolved nitrous oxide, and lysimeters, suction cups and finally an in situ destructive soil sampling procedure were all used to assess leaching losses and the rate of nitrification of ammonium fertiliser. Results suggest that under the extreme total annual rainfall at Dami (3, 500 - 4, 000 mm) and to a lesser extent at Sangara (2, 500 - 3, 000 mm), leaching is the dominant loss pathway, with the rate of loss depending, to some extent, on the rate of nitrate formation and the retentivity of the soil for ammonium, but mainly on the rate at which drainage water is generated.

All three berry seed <b>oils</b> were <b>stripped</b> of their minor components using a silicic acid column and a hexane/methanol solvent partitioning system, respectively. Accelerated oxidations under Schaal oven and photooxidative conditions demonstrated that the oxidative stability of non-stripped, and column-stripped oils was different. Tocopherols and tocotrienols, collectively known as tocols, were determined by high performance liquid chromatography, and found to affect the stability of oils by donating hydrogen atoms in the dark at 60 °C. Pigments, including carotenoids and chlorophylls, were also measured by UV-visible spectrophotometry and were found to influence the stability of the oils. The stability of the oils was dictated by their fatty acid composition, TAG profile, and the type and quantity of their total tocols and pigments present. All tested seed oils contained significant levels of α-linolenic acid, ranging from 13. 4 to 33. 7 g per 100 g of oil, along with a low ratio of n− 6 /n− 3 fatty acids (1. 49 − 3. 86). Six triacylglycerols, namely LnLnLn, LnLLn, LLLn, LLL, OLL and OLLn were detected by high-performance liquid chromatography in berry seed oils tested, where O, L and Ln, are oleoyl, linoleoyl, and linonenoyl fatty acids, respectively. Total tocol contents were 286. 3 − 1302. 9 ppm, and included α-, γ-, and δ-tocopherols as well as δ-tocotrienol. The highest TPC of 0. 48 mg gallic acid equivalents per gram of oil was observed in the black raspberry seed oil. Oxidative stability of the three berry seed oils tested was affected by their triacylglycerol profiles, positional distribution of fatty acids, storage conditions and minor components. These data suggests that the cold-pressed berry seed oils may also serve as potential dietary sources for tocols, α-linolenic acid (ALA) and natural antioxidants. These oils must be well protected from oxidative deterioration by proper storage in the dark {{and in the absence of}} oxygen and with minimal processing in order to retain their integrity and health promoting minor components...|$|R

Sol-gel equipment designed and constructed for this study is capable of producing enough gelling product in one day to yield 10 g of sintered cerium dioxide microspheres.

Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that spheres washed by the improved method have 4. 5 times less volatile mass loss upon heating than spheres washed by a traditional process. Impurity analysis on sintered microspheres has shown carbon impurities below 30 ppm and trace element levels below specified limits for Pu- 238 oxide fuels.

Different type of substrates {{were used for}} the moving mold; copper, low carbon steel, alumina coated steel, nickel coated steel, and zirconia coated steel. Interfacial heat fluxes between the solidifying strip and the moving mold substrate were calculated by the IHCP (Inverse Heat Conduction Problem) technique. The temperature history of the solidifying strip was calculated using the Enthalpy FVM (Finite Volume Method) associated with Scheil's model of solidification. The influence of thermophysical and morphological properties of mold substrates, wetting environment, casting speed, melt superheat, and grain refiner, on strip microstructures and their cooling rates, were thoroughly investigated. Maximum heat fluxes appeared about 0. 1 ~ 0. 2 seconds after the moment of thermal contact. For a copper substrate, these reached up to 7 MW/m 2, whereas those for a steel substrate were ~ 3 MW/m 2. The rate of heat transfer to coated substrates was significantly delayed and reduced because of the low thermal conductivity of coating layers. Maximum cooling rates of aluminum and magnesium strips reached about 200 °C/s on copper and about 150 °C/s on steel. It was found that the major thermal resistance resided in an interfacial layer separating the strip from the substrate. This interfacial layer presumably corresponded to the shrinkage of solidified skin or the entrainment of a thin air film resulting in numerous air pockets at the bottom surface of <b>strips.</b> <b>Oil</b> spraying onto the mold surface changed the interfacial wettability and dramatically improved the cast surface of the strips. The good quality of strip samples obtained suggests the high potential for the direct casting of these alloys on single belt casters...|$|R
40|$|Frying {{is a key}} {{processing}} step {{during the}} production of French fries and important for end product quality and sensory attributes. It is governed by heat and mass transfer between the frying oil and the potato strips. Crust and color of the French fries are key quality parameters and important in consumer perception. Crust formation {{is a result of}} combined heat and mass transfer effects. Convective heat transfer from frying <b>oil</b> to potato <b>strips</b> and heat conduction within the tissue cause water evaporation. Mass transfer occurs in the form of water vapor release to the frying oil and oil absorption in the outer layers of the potato strips. Browning of French fries is related to Maillard reactions between reducing sugars and amino acids. High contents of reducing sugars are often related to an undesired dark color and bitter taste of French fries. High-intensity ultrasound transmitted to liquid media causes cavitation and microstreaming, which can influence boundary layers and cell structures and result in improved heat and mass transfer. The influence of an ultrasound treatment of potato strips during the par-frying step was investigated {{in order to determine the}} effect on the resulting changes in product quality. Improved heat transfer at the product surface due to micro-streaming in the oil and a facilitated release of vapor from the product surface was observed. A faster crust formation was found at the initial phase of frying but the crust was found to become softer at longer sonication times due to persistent mechanical ultrasound effects. French fries from ultrasound assisted par-frying had a lighter color after finish-frying in comparison to the conventionally par-fried samples due to an improved release of reducing sugars from the tissue. Ultrasound-assisted par-frying showed to be effective in modifying heat and mass transfer with an impact on crust formation and browning of French fries. Further work is required regarding the optimization of parameters and sonication times...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{search for}} greater {{competitiveness}} {{in the field}} of maintenance of railway vehicles involves the support of traditional preventive maintenance, organised on scheduled dates, with the most innovative state-of-the-art condition-based maintenance techniques, that provide information on the mission profile of the most critical components through continuous monitoring and introduction of appropriate counters The determination of the counters and of intervention policies for condition-based maintenance requires the analysis of inputs from the field extracted from maintenance operations reports which contain "quantitative" measures and other data useful to describe the consumption patterns This work is centred on the analysis of consumable materials subject to wear and tear that need to be replenished or replaced during any maintenance work It is very important to monitor their wear rate as some of these materials represent a significant cost item, their consumption is also often a function of vehicle mission profile The measurement of parameters takes place {{on the occasion of the}} periodic vehicle inspection Mechanical and geometrical data are taken intended to determine whether the conditions of wear are still compatible with operation without anomaly, at least until the next planned intervention To carry out this analysis, workshop reports have been viewed relating to three years' maintenance of 30 E 483 locomotives for cargo trains used by some private railway companies In this way the average consumption of the pantographs' <b>strips,</b> <b>oil</b> for gear reducers, distilled water for batteries, sand and grease for the wheel flange lubrication system were calculated The results obtained allow validating the correctness of the preventive maintenance plan and suggesting changes In addition the consumption rate analysis provides important information about the health of some key components Finally, through the integration of these results with the readings from continuous monitoring, the evolution of the maintenance scheme is completed and the information indicating the remaining life of the components directly affected by the wear of materials analysed is exploited...|$|R
40|$|During 100 h {{servicing}} of an aeroengine, chips were {{noticed in}} the <b>oil</b> system. <b>Strip</b> examination of the engine revealed severe damages to the cover side bearing on O 3 axis of the engine accessory gearbox with cage broken and lying inside the casing along with the balls. In addition, on the cover side, the bush on O 3 axis was found without nuts and tab washers. The damaged bearing along with the dislodged nuts and tab washers were sent to this laboratory for analyzing the cause(s) of failure. Examination revealed that there was spalling, smearing and flow of material in all elements of the cover side bearing. There was sliding in the bearing due to breakage of the cage resulting in loss of shape of the balls and flow of material out of inner raceway. Fractographic study confirmed that the cage of the bearing had failed by fatigue. This, along with the signatures of failure in the bearing as a whole indicated that the failure was progressive in nature, and it was caused due to rotational creep from either inner ring being loose or outer ring being loose or excessive axial load. Since there is remote possibility of excessive axial load on the bearing on O 3 axis of the EAGB, looseness in the inner ring and/or outer ring or any problem(s) elsewhere which could give rise to similar situation {{appears to be the}} reason for the bearing failure. Laboratory examination did not reveal any damages to the dislodged nuts except for rubbing marks along all six edges of the nut faces. The Cu-plating on all the faces was found undisturbed. The threads were found to be in tact without any distress. This leads {{to the conclusion that the}} bush nuts have come out of the bolts by progressive unwinding. This is further substantiated by the presence of rubbing marks on all the six edges of the nuts, which is possible only when the nuts rotate around the axis, that is, the bolts, and they make contact periodically with the tab washer surface. The two tab washers provided for examination showed fretting damage on the contacting surfaces with the nuts as well as the bush. This is indicative of relative movement of the tab washers in assembly in service. Examination also revealed that the bending of the tab washers for effecting the locking of the nuts was oblique and also, the contact between the tab washer and the nut faces was inadequate. This was evident from the contact marks available on the tab washer surfaces. Evidences suggest that the nut surface was in partial contact with the tab washer and hence, the locking was not effective enough to offer adequate resistance for preventing unwinding of the nuts even under normal operating conditions. Once there was unwinding of the nuts, the bush on the cover side was as good as unsupported. This is similar to a situation wherein the outer ring of the bearing is loose. Hence, the looseness in the bush would result in progressive failure in the bearing as seen in the present case. The disturbances caused because of progressive failure in the cover side bearing had resulted in initiation of spalling on all rolling surfaces of the bearing on the casing side as well. Hence, the damages to this bearing are secondary in nature. Laboratory studies did not reveal any metallurgical deficiencies in the bearing elements or in the tab washers which could give rise to the present failure. Also, negligible discolouration even after complete destruction of the bearing indicates that there were no lubrication related issues which could be the cause of failure. Based on the above, it is concluded that the failure in the cover side bearing on O 3 axis of EAGB was progressive in nature. The failure was resulted due to unwinding and dislodgement of the nuts meant for securing the bush in position. Investigation showed that the unwinding of the nuts was possible because of deficiency in locking mechanism. Therefore, the primary cause for the bearing failure is attributed to either improper assembly of tab washers or inappropriate choice of the tab washer type for the present application...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore how {{phospholipids}} at concentrations similar as in refined vegetable oils impact bulk oil lipid oxidation. The possible formation of association colloids and synergism with primary antioxidants are considered. The results provided {{a better understanding of}} the pro- and antioxidant activities of phospholipids. Lipid oxidation leads to quality deterioration by generating off-flavor, nutrient loss, color alteration, texture changes, and even generation of potential toxic products. Phospholipids are important minor components in edible oil that play a role in lipid oxidation. Surface active phospholipids have an intermediate hydrophilic–lipophilic balance value, which allows them to form association colloids such as reverse micelles in bulk oil. These association colloids can influence lipid oxidation since they create lipid–water interfaces where prooxidants and antioxidants can interact with triacylglycerols. In this study, we examined the formation of reverse micelles in a <b>stripped</b> <b>oil</b> system by dioleoyl phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) and the effect of these physical structures on lipidoxidation kinetics. The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of DOPE was approximately 200 μmol/kg oil at 45 °C. Oxidation kinetics studies showed that DOPE was prooxidative when it was above its CMC (400 and 1, 000 μM), reducing the lag phase from 14 days (control) to 8 days. The addition of combinations of DOPE and dioleoyl phosphocholine (DOPC) resulted in formation of mixed micelles with a CMC of 80 μmol/kg oil at 45 °C. These mixed micelles were also prooxidative when concentrations (100 and 500 μM) were above the CMC, decreasing the lag phase from 14 to 8 days. DOPC and DOPE reverse micelles were examined on their impacts on the activity of primary antioxidants such as the nonpolar α-tocopherol and the polar trolox in stripped and commercial soybean oils. The results showed that DOPC reverse micelles decreased the activity of 100 μM α-tocopherol or trolox. On the other hand, DOPE increased the antioxidant activity of both α-tocopherol and trolox. The polar trolox exhibited better antioxidant activity than the nonpolar α- tocopherol in the presence of both DOPC and DOPE reverse micelles because trolox partitioned more at the water-lipid interface, which was confirmed by a fluorescence steady state spectroscopy. Different ratios of DOPE to DOPC were added to oil containing 100 μM α-tocopherol, and antioxidant activity increased with increasing DOPE/DOPC ratio. Addition of DOPE to commercial oil inhibited lipid oxidation, where as DOPC was ineffective. HPLC showed that DOPE regenerated α-tocopherol. Overall, these findings provide {{a better understanding of the}} role of phospholipids reverse micelles in lipid oxidation in edible oil and indicating that the antioxidant activity of tocopherols could be improved by utilizing phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to engineer the properties of reverse micelles in bulk oil...|$|R
