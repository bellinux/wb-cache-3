5|$|On May 20, 2012, Perl 5.16 was released. Notable new {{features}} include {{the ability to}} specify a given version of Perl that <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> emulate, allowing users to upgrade their version of Perl, but still run old scripts that would normally be incompatible. Perl 5.16 also updates the core to support Unicode 6.1.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{speakers}} will {{switch between}} polite and formal styles {{depending on the}} situation and the atmosphere that <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> convey.|$|E
25|$|Thus, if <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> obtain {{only one}} of the cross-products, one must control which {{carbonyl}} becomes the nucleophilic enol/enolate and which remains in its electrophilic carbonyl form.|$|E
50|$|Rabbi Rifael {{is said to}} {{have refused}} to {{participate}} in the excommunication initiated against the Shneur Zalman of Liadi based on his claim that greater challenges face <b>one</b> <b>wishing</b> <b>to</b> initiate punishment than <b>one</b> <b>wishing</b> <b>to</b> initiate blessing.|$|R

60|$|The loafers, though {{eager to}} witness the clash, did not rise from their chairs till after Hanscom left. No <b>one</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> betray unseemly haste.|$|R
25|$|If <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> {{distinguish}} {{an upper}} and {{lower part of the}} transition zone {{in the absence of a}} subsurface drainage system, one may specify in the input data a drainage system with zero intensity.|$|E
25|$|If <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> simply make ordinal {{comparisons}} between samples (is one sample {{more or less}} varied than another), the choice of IQV is relatively less important, as they will often give the same ordering.|$|E
25|$|This allows an {{exponentially}} growing {{variable to}} be modeled with a log-linear model. For example, if <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> empirically estimate {{the growth rate}} from intertemporal data on x, one can linearly regress log x on t.|$|E

60|$|As every <b>one</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> be convinced, no one offered any {{argument}} {{in opposition to}} Mr. St. George's view of the case; and some were already in the wood.|$|R
25|$|SodaStream {{can only}} {{carbonate}} water, one litre at a time, in the supplied bottle; the concentrates are added after carbonated water {{is removed from}} the machine. This poses a limitation if <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> carbonate wine or fresh fruit juices.|$|E
25|$|In {{topology}} {{and related}} fields of mathematics, {{there are several}} restrictions that one often makes on the kinds of topological spaces that <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> consider. Some of these restrictions are given by the separation axioms. These are sometimes called Tychonoff separation axioms, after Andrey Tychonoff.|$|E
25|$|If <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> count free polyominoes instead, {{then one}} may check for symmetries after {{creating}} each n-omino. However, it is faster to generate symmetric polyominoes separately (by {{a variation of}} this method) and so {{determine the number of}} free polyominoes by Burnside's lemma.|$|E
50|$|By the {{beginning}} of the next year, the war's outcome was clear. It became increasingly difficult to persuade Allied troops to risk their lives when peace was in sight. No <b>one</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> be the last man killed.|$|R

60|$|A {{struggle}} of course ensued, for every <b>one</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> go on, and fear made many selfish. The wounded, {{the women and}} children, were taken, as far as possible, and the laden train moved away, leaving many anxious watchers behind.|$|R
25|$|Now when {{occasion}} offers it is a {{good thing}} to oppose our enemies and to destroy their power of attack, but lacking such opportunity it is safe to keep quiet, while if <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> get any benefit from them it is advantageous to propitiate them.|$|E
25|$|An {{orthonormal}} {{basis for}} Minkowski space necessarily consists of one timelike and three spacelike unit vectors. If <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> work with non-orthonormal bases {{it is possible}} to have other combinations of vectors. For example, one can easily construct a (non-orthonormal) basis consisting entirely of null vectors, called a null basis.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{is an example of}} applying a continuity correction. Suppose <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> calculate Pr(Xnbsp&≤nbsp&8) for a binomial random variable X. If Y has a distribution given by the normal approximation, then Pr(Xnbsp&≤nbsp&8) is approximated by Pr(Ynbsp&≤nbsp&8.5). The addition of 0.5 is the continuity correction; the uncorrected normal approximation gives considerably less accurate results.|$|E
60|$|No <b>one</b> <b>wished</b> <b>to</b> disturb them; {{no one but}} Sir Marmaduke, {{and with}} him it was once again that morbid access of curiosity, the passionate, intense desire to know and to probe every tiny detail in {{connection}} with his own crime.|$|R

25|$|When a {{fraction}} A1, B1 and/or U1 {{in the first}} season differs from fractions are A2, B2 and/or U2 in the second season, because the irrigation regimes in the seasons differ, the program will detect that a certain rotation occurs. If <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> avoid this, one may specify the same fractions in all seasons (A2=A1, B2=B1, U2=U1), but the crops and irrigation quantities {{may have to be}} adjusted in proportion.|$|E
25|$|Successful {{statistical}} {{practice is}} based on focused problem definition. In sampling, this includes defining the population from which our sample is drawn. A population {{can be defined as}} including all people or items with the characteristic <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> understand. Because there is very rarely enough time or money to gather information from everyone or everything in a population, the goal becomes finding a representative sample (or subset) of that population.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution of Singapore and all {{laws are}} written in English, and interpreters are {{required}} if <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> address the Singaporean Courts in a language other than English. English is the native tongue for only one-third of all Singaporeans, with roughly {{a quarter of all}} Singaporean Malays, a third of all Singaporean Chinese, and half of all Singaporean Indians speaking it as their native tongue. Twenty percent of Singaporeans cannot read or write in English.|$|E

5000|$|Exporting: The {{definitions}} from {{a module}} that <b>one</b> <b>wish</b> other modules <b>to</b> {{have access to}} are exported using the keyword [...] followed by an exports module signature. The exports module signature can either simply consist of the keyword [...] or as a sequence of export signatures. Such export signatures are specific for types, values, functions and operations and each of these are started with the corresponding keyword. In case <b>one</b> <b>wish</b> <b>to</b> export the internal structure of a type the keyword [...] must be used.|$|R

25|$|For long-distance travel, {{reservation}} of a berth can be {{done for}} comfortable travel up to 120 days before the date of intended travel. Details such as the name, age and concession (if eligible) are required and are recorded on the ticket. The ticket price usually includes the base fare, which depends on the classification of the train (example: super-fast surcharge if the train is classified as a super-fast), the class in which <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> travel and the reservation charge for overnight journeys.|$|E
25|$|Nolte {{contends that}} the great decisive event of the 20th century was the Russian Revolution of 1917, which plunged all of Europe into a long-simmering civil war that lasted until 1945. To Nolte, fascism, communism's twin, arose as a desperate {{response}} by the threatened middle classes of Europe to what Nolte has often called the “Bolshevik peril”. He suggests that if <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> understand the Holocaust, one should begin with the Industrial Revolution in Britain, and then understand {{the rule of the}} Khmer Rouge in Cambodia.|$|E
25|$|The aim of any {{microscope}} is {{to magnify}} images or photos {{of a small}} object and to see fine details. In forensic; the type of specimen, the information <b>one</b> <b>wishes</b> <b>to</b> obtain from it {{and the type of}} microscope chosen for the task will determine if the sample preparation is required. For example, ink lines, blood stains or bullets, no treatment is required and the evidence shows directly from appropriate microscope without any form of sample preparation, but for traces of particular matter, the sample preparation must be done before microscopical examination occurs.|$|E
