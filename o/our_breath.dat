500|$|Wallace Harrison's assistant, {{architect}} George Dudley, later stated: [...] "It literally took <b>our</b> <b>breath</b> away to see {{the simple}} plane of the site kept open from First Avenue to the River, only three structures on it, standing free, a fourth lying low behind them along the river’s edge... also said, ‘beauty {{will come from the}} buildings being in the right space!’. The comparison between Le Corbusier’s heavy block and Niemeyer’s startling, elegantly articulated composition {{seemed to me to be}} in everyone’s mind..." [...] Later on, Corbusier came once again to Niemeyer and asked him to reposition the Assembly Hall back to the center of the site. Such modification would destroy Niemeyer’s plans for a large civic square. However, he finally decided to accept the modification: [...] "I felt [...] would like to do his project, and he was the master. I do not regret my decision." [...] Together, they submitted the scheme 23–32, which was built and is what can be seen today. Along with suggestions from the other members of the Board of Design Consultants, this was developed into project 42G. [...] This late project was built with some reductions and other modifications.|$|E
500|$|After collaborating on {{her great}} successes The Woman in Me (1995) and Come on Over (1997), Twain and her then-husband Robert John [...] "Mutt" [...] Lange {{decided to take}} a musical hiatus. The two {{relocated}} to Switzerland, settled down, and had a child, Eja, in August 2001. Twain felt content and was in a very positive state of mind, which inspired Up! (2002). She and Lange conceptualized the album to be very positive, optimistic, and uplifting; they desired to evade dark subject matters, yet still be profound through optimism. In doing so, they co-wrote every track on Up!, in which few tracks were ballads, something Twain considered a small ratio compared to the nineteen songs on the album. She explained it was not done deliberately, but influenced by her and Lange's state of mind at the time, adding, [...] "There just didn't seem to be enough room for [...] ". One of the ballads was [...] "It Only Hurts when I'm Breathing", which Twain deemed necessary to come down in tempo. She said the song was very powerful and, as with each track on Up!, was significant to her. Twain said of the track, [...] "This is the only heartbreak song on the new CD. [...] a chance {{for all of us to}} catch <b>our</b> <b>breath</b> here." [...] "It Only Hurts when I'm Breathing" [...] was later selected as the eighth and final single from Up!, fifth to impact the North American music market. It was released to country radio on February 9, 2004 and to adult contemporary radio on March 22, 2004. A live CD single and digital download were taken from Up! Live in Chicago, and released on March 9, 2004 with the same cover as the video album. CD singles and 7" [...] singles were later issued by Mercury Nashville Records on March 30, 2004.|$|E

2500|$|As the Financial {{crisis of}} 2007–2008 reached a peak with the {{liquidity}} crisis of September 2008, Clinton proposed {{a revival of}} the New Deal-era Home Owners' Loan Corporation, to help homeowners refinance their mortgages. [...] Writing in a Wall Street Journal op-ed, she said that [...] "This is a sink-or-swim moment for America. We cannot simply catch <b>our</b> <b>breath.</b> We've got to swim for the shores." [...] Regarding the proposed bailout of United States financial system, she initially pronounced the $700 billion rescue plan flawed, but said she would support it. [...] On October 1, 2008, she voted in favor of the Senate legislation, HR1424, saying that it represented the interests of the American people; it passed the Senate 74–25.|$|E
2500|$|Luke Davies of The Monthly {{applauded the}} film for recreating [...] "the atmosphere, {{the sense of}} hope and battle; even the sound design, bustling with street noise, adds much vibrancy to the tale", but voiced criticisms {{in regard to the}} message of the film, stating [...] "while the film is a {{political}} narrative in a grand historical sense, the murder of Milk is neither a political assassination nor an act of homophobic rage. Rather, it is an act of revenge for perceived wrongs and public humiliation," [...] Davies continues to postulate that [...] "It seems as likely that Milk would have been murdered were he heterosexual. So the film can't be the heroic tale of a political martyr it needs to be in order to hold us and take <b>our</b> <b>breath</b> away. It's a simpler story, about a man who fought an extraordinary political fight and who was killed, arbitrarily and unnecessarily." [...] Although Davies found Penn's portrayal of Milk moving, he adds that [...] "on a minor but troubling note, there are times when Penn's version of 'gay' acting veers dangerously close to a twee version of his childlike (read: 'mentally retarded') acting in I Am Sam." [...] All his criticisms aside, Davies concludes that [...] "the heart of the film– and while it is not perfect, it is uplifting– lies in Penn's portrayal of Milk's generosity of spirit.|$|E
2500|$|Three downtempo ballads follow, called [...] "the kind {{of songs}} you wouldn't {{want to listen}} to at all: the lyrics are boring at best and {{completely}} cliché at worst" [...] by one reviewer. The first, [...] "Don't Forsake Me" [...] is a torch song that was frequently compared to [...] "Too Hurt to Dance" [...] due to its lyrics about heartache. The song follows the retro sound Duffy had been previously known for and was called [...] "indebted to the pre-Beatles era". It was received negatively for [...] "paint too much of a resemblance" [...] to [...] "Warwick Avenue". The title song, which follows, is a love song that was again said to contain 1950s music references. The song features vinyl sounds and is sung to the accompaniment of an acoustic guitar. The final song in the trio of ballads is [...] "Breath Away", a 1960s-inspired ballad about love. Contactmusic.com [...] implied that the song is boring, saying that [...] " [...] hardly does anything to take <b>our</b> <b>breath</b> away", although it was said to [...] "showcase" [...] her vocal talents. Endlessly continues with two more up-tempo songs with a dance-orientated sound: [...] "Lovestruck" [...] and [...] "Girl", both called [...] "sassy" [...] and [...] "playful". The former is a disco song described as having [...] "the brashness of a Bond theme", with [...] "tragic undertones" [...] of a [...] "haunting creation". Lyrically, the song speaks of being so in love you are [...] "sleepless all night long", with the song opening [...] "It's a physical thing we got and I'm in paradise". The lyrical sentiment of [...] "My Boy" [...] is echoed in the latter, with the song being sung [...] "Girl, girl/Stay away, girl/Come back another day, girl/Better still don't come back ever stay away from here forever." [...] The album's final song, the string-led [...] "Hard for the Heart" [...] continues the soul pop sound of Rockferry and was described as a [...] "soulful pop confection" [...] by Uncut, whilst being labelled as the stand-out song on the album by many reviewers. The song's climax was compared to the song [...] "Hey Jude" [...] (1968) by The Beatles, whilst a reviewer for the BBC asserted that it [...] "unconsciously borrows from Coldplay's [...] "The Scientist"." [...] Entertainment Focus, on the other hand called it a [...] "lost Burt Bacharach classic", and Hammond's production skills were also praised on the song. It also received praise concerning Duffy's voice, something that was a feature of many critics' reviews, with Sputnik Music noting, [...] ""Hard for the Heart" [...] has the singer in an intensely emotional and surprisingly restrained moment. Her beautiful timbre finally gets to shine without choking out the sophisticated and apotheotic production, giving pulse and strength to a strikingly poetic composition." ...|$|E
