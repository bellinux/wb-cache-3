5|$|<b>Other</b> <b>{{analyses}}</b> {{have found}} Paranthodon {{closely related to}} Tuojiangosaurus, Loricatosaurus, and Kentrosaurus within Stegosaurinae. Even though phylogenetic analyses recognize Paranthodon as a stegosaurid, the type material actually bears no synapomorphies of Stegosauria. However, the material is likely of stegosaurian nature, and phylogenies by many authors have {{found it to be}} within the group.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{relationships}} with other basal sauropod genera remain unclear. Ronan Allain and colleagues (2004, 2008) found that Vulcanodon is most closely related to Tazoudasaurus, a newly discovered sauropod genus from Morocco. These researchers suggested reintroducing the name Vulcanodontidae to name the clade containing Vulcanodon and Tazoudasaurus.

5|$|A {{contrasting}} analysis {{conducted by}} Rauhut and Carrano in 2016 found slightly different relationships within Noasauridae. The specimen CCG 20011 (an as-of-yet unnamed taxon formerly {{referred to the}} tetanuran Chuandongocoelurus), which {{was not included in}} <b>other</b> <b>analyses,</b> was found to be closer to Elaphrosaurus than Limusaurus, with the three taxa representing Elaphrosaurinae. Velocisaurus, Noasaurus and Masiakasaurus were the only taxa within Noasaurinae, as Laevisuchus and Deltadromeus were placed basal to the group of Noasaurinae and Elaphrosaurinae within Noasauridae.|$|E

5|$|The Alcathoe bat (Myotis alcathoe) is a European bat in {{the genus}} Myotis. Known only from Greece and Hungary {{when it was}} first {{described}} in 2001, its known distribution has since expanded to Spain, England, Sweden, and Azerbaijan, among other countries. It is similar to the whiskered bat (Myotis mystacinus) and other species and is difficult to distinguish from them. However, its brown fur is distinctive and it is clearly different in characters of its karyotype and DNA sequences. Although some genetic data suggest that it is related to Geoffroy's bat (Myotis emarginatus), <b>other</b> <b>analyses</b> do not support a close relationship between M.alcathoe and any other species.|$|E

5|$|Paul {{has been}} {{described}} as conservative and libertarian. According to University of Georgia political scientist Keith Poole, Paul had the most conservative voting record of any member of Congress from 1937 to 2002, and is the most conservative of the candidates that had sought the 2012 Republican nomination for president, on a scale primarily measuring positions on the role of government in managing the economy– not positions on social issues or foreign policy matters. <b>Other</b> <b>analyses,</b> in which key votes on domestic social issues and foreign policy factor more heavily, have judged Paul much more moderate. The National Journal, for instance, rated Paul only the 145th most conservative member of the House of Representatives (out of 435) based on votes cast in 2010.|$|E

25|$|The tax was {{supported}} by environmental groups, student groups and nearly every local government. Opposition to the tax was headed by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation who drew the public's attention to purported misuse of funds by TransLink. A widely circulated statistic {{was the fact that}} TransLink had the highest cost per revenue passenger of the major Canadian transit agencies. Supporters countered with <b>other</b> <b>analyses</b> that showed TransLink to be ranked first by cost per service hour, service hours per $1 million and service hours per capita. The Yes campaign outspent the No campaign by $5.8 million to $40,000.

25|$|On September 13, 2001, Zdeněk Bažant, {{professor}} of civil engineering and materials science at Northwestern University, circulated a draft paper with {{results of a}} simple analysis of the World Trade Center collapse.

Once {{more than half of}} the columns on a particular floor buckled, the overhead structure could no longer be supported and complete collapse of the structures occurred. Bažant later published an expanded version of this analysis. <b>Other</b> <b>analyses</b> were conducted by MIT civil engineers Oral Buyukozturk and Franz-Josef Ulm, who also described a collapse mechanism on September 21, 2001.

500|$|Velociraptor is {{a member}} of the group Eudromaeosauria, a derived {{sub-group}} of the larger family Dromaeosauridae. It is often placed within its own [...] "subfamily", Velociraptorinae. In phylogenetic taxonomy, Velociraptorinae is usually defined as [...] "all dromaeosaurs more closely related to Velociraptor than to Dromaeosaurus." [...] However, dromaeosaurid classification is highly variable. Originally, the subfamily Velociraptorinae was erected solely to contain Velociraptor. <b>Other</b> <b>analyses</b> have often included other genera, usually Deinonychus and Saurornitholestes, and more recently Tsaagan. However, several studies published during the 2010s, including expanded versions of the analyses that found support for Velociraptorinae, have failed to resolve it as a distinct group, but rather have suggested it is a paraphyletic grade which gave rise to the Dromaeosaurinae.|$|E
