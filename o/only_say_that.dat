5|$|A {{soldier on}} {{vacation}} here said he witnessed a terrible atrocity {{in the occupied}} parts of Poland. He watched as naked Jewish {{men and women were}} placed in front of a long deep ditch and upon the order of the SS were shot by Ukrainians {{in the back of their}} heads and they fell into the ditch. Then the ditch was filled with dirt even as he could still hear screams coming from people still alive in the ditch. These inhuman atrocities were so terrible that some of the Ukrainians, who were used as tools, suffered nervous breakdowns. All the soldiers who had knowledge of these bestial actions of these Nazi sub-humans were of the opinion that the German people should be shaking in their shoes because of the coming retribution. There is no punishment that would be hard enough to be applied to these Nazi beasts. Of course, when the retribution comes, the innocent will have to suffer along with them. But because ninety-nine percent of the German population is guilty, directly or indirectly, for the present situation, we can <b>only</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> those who travel together will hang together. , Friedrich Kellner exhibit.

25|$|Acemoglu and Robinson {{counter that}} their theory distinguishes between {{political}} and economic institutions {{and that it is}} not political institutions that contribute to growth directly but economic institutions shaped by the political institutions. In the case of China, even though the political institutions on a higher level are far from inclusive, the incentive to reform Chinese economy does come from political institutions; in 1978 from Deng Xiaoping's Opening up policy {{at the end of the}} internal political feud during the Cultural Revolution. This exactly fits into the theory that the change in political institutions has shaped economic institutions and thus has influenced economic performance. This economic growth is further expected to shape the political institutions in China in the future. One can <b>only</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> China is an outlier to the theory when in the future China becomes as wealthy as U.S. or Germany but still remains an authoritarian regime.|$|E

500|$|This lack {{of convincing}} early {{evidence}} {{is the reason}} many recent historians exclude Arthur from their accounts of sub-Roman Britain. In the view of historian Thomas Charles-Edwards, [...] "at {{this stage of the}} enquiry, one can <b>only</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there may well have been an historical Arthur [...] the historian can as yet say nothing of value about him". These modern admissions of ignorance are a relatively recent trend; earlier generations of historians were less sceptical. The historian John Morris made the putative reign of Arthur the organising principle of his history of sub-Roman Britain and Ireland, The Age of Arthur (1973). Even so, he found little to say about a historical Arthur.|$|E

She moved into Tracy's house for this period, and was {{with him when he}} died on June 10, 1967. Out of consideration for Tracy's family, she did not attend his funeral. It was only after Louise Tracy's death, in 1983, that Hepburn began to speak publicly about her feelings for her frequent co-star. In response to the question of why she stayed with Tracy for so long, despite the nature of their relationship, she said, [...] "I honestly don't know.

500|$|Verity {{is often}} cited {{as one of the}} {{greatest}} slow left-arm spinners to play the game. Robertson-Glasgow wrote: [...] "We can <b>only</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> in his own short time, he was the best of his kind." [...] The writer considered Verity may not quite have achieved the heights of some other great bowlers of his type, but [...] "as a workman-artist, he will take some beating." [...] Douglas Jardine rated him higher than any previous Yorkshire spinners, and Les Ames considered him the best left-arm spinner he had played against. Bradman wrote: [...] "Undoubtedly he w{{as one of the greatest}} slow left-handed spinners of all time. His record testifies to that. No Australian left-hander of that type was Verity's equal and of the Englishmen I saw... there is no doubt that Hedley was as good or better than the others." ...|$|E
500|$|Various {{authorities}} have treated the taxon {{as either a}} Boletus, Leccinum, or Tylopilus, depending on which morphological characteristics they deemed most significant. Rolf Singer initially considered the species most appropriately placed in Tylopilus {{on account of the}} reddish-brown spore print, a taxonomic opinion shared by Alexander H. Smith and Harry Thiers, who wrote [...] "Concerning whether or not the species should be placed in Leccinum, we can <b>only</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> the color of the stipe ornamentation is merely a reflection of the color of the stipe generally and that it does not change color in a characteristic pattern as it ages. For this reason we exclude it from Leccinum and agree with Singer that it is a Tylopilus." [...] Later however, Singer thought the somewhat scabrous ornamentation of the stipe justified a placement in Leccinum. René Pomerleau had previously (1959) placed the species in Leccinum, but this transfer was invalid, as no basionym was specified.|$|E
500|$|Currently, {{there is}} no {{consensus}} on the issue of Philip's Christianity. Timothy Barnes, who reviewed Shahîd's chapters on [...] "The First Christian Emperor" [...] and [...] "Eusebius and the Arabs" [...] in 1979, would <b>only</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> Eusebius [...] " [...] Philip as a Christian", in his Constantine and Eusebius (1981). Warwick Ball, author of Rome and the East: The transformation of an empire (2000), argued in favor of Philip's Christianity. David Potter, author of The Roman Empire at Bay (2004), treated the matter dismissively: accounts of Philip's Christianity were simply [...] "bogus", Potter wrote, and works that accepted them should be treated with less respect on that count alone. Some scholars, like Glen Bowersock, took a middle route. Bowersock, reviewing Shahîd's Rome and the Arabs for the Classical Review in 1986, wrote: [...] "I doubt many will be convinced by the extreme position that [...] has taken, but his arguments do offer some basis for believing that Philip was seriously interested in the religion". He reiterated that view in his Roman Arabia (1980, 3rd rev. ed. 1994).|$|E

500|$|Gates {{never forgot}} J. P. Morgan's snub at the U. S. Steel merger. [...] One {{month after the}} deal was completed, he became {{involved}} in a struggle between E. H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad and James J. Hill of the Northern Pacific Railway. [...] Both men sought control of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad. [...] Hill, who was financed by J. P. Morgan, needed access to Chicago; Harriman was interested in stopping Hill from obtaining it. [...] Gates saw {{this as an opportunity}} to get back at Morgan for his refusal to seat him on the board of U. S. Steel. Along with Harriman, he began buying shares of Northern Pacific stock. [...] When James Hill noted a sudden rise in Northern Pacific stock prices, he traveled to New York to consult with Morgan. Morgan and Hill stopped the sales of the Northern Pacific stock, which remained high while other stocks took steep drops. Those who had been selling short could not obtain enough stock to cover themselves and were faced with large financial losses. It was rumored that Gates was short 60,000 shares of Northern Pacific stock. [...] Gates did not confirm or deny any of the rumors about the railroad stock and would <b>only</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> he was doing well.|$|E
500|$|The Guardian of Education was {{the first}} {{periodical}} to take the reviewing of children's books seriously. Trimmer's over four hundred reviews constituted a set of distinct and identifiable criteria regarding what was valuable in this new genre. As a high-church Anglican, she was intent on protecting Christianity from secularism as well as evangelicalism, particularly as the latter manifested itself in Methodism. Her reviews also reveal {{her to be a}} staunch monarchist and opponent of the French Revolution. As Grenby puts it, [...] "her initial questions of any children's books that came before her were always first, was it damaging to religion and second, was it damaging to political loyalty and the established social hierarchy". Religion was Trimmer's first priority and her emphasis on the doctrine of Biblical inerrancy illustrated her fundamentalism. She wrote to a friend: [...] "I will <b>only</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> the more I reflect on the subject, the more I am convinced that it is not right to supersede the figurative style in which they speak of God and divine things, my opinion is, that whoever attempts to teach the truths of divine revelation, should follow the method of the inspired writers as nearly as possible" [...] For Trimmer, the truth of the Bible was not only in its content, but also in its style, and some of her harshest reviews were written against texts that altered both the style and the substance of the Bible.|$|E
