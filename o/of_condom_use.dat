5|$|Due to {{the vast}} scope of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, many Malawian men believe that HIV {{contraction}} and death from AIDS are inevitable. Older men in particular often claim that the HIV/AIDS epidemic is a punishment issued by God or other supernatural forces. Other men refer to their own irresponsible sexual behaviors when explaining why they believe that death from AIDS is inevitable. These men sometimes claim that unprotected sex is natural (and therefore necessary and good) when justifying their lack <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> during sex with extramarital partners. Finally, some men identify as HIV-positive without having undergone testing for HIV, preferring {{to believe that they}} have already been infected so they can avoid adopting undesirable preventative measures such as condom use or strict fidelity. Because of these fatalistic beliefs, many men continue engaging in extramarital sexual relations despite the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Malawi.|$|E
25|$|Up to the 19th century, condoms were {{generally}} used {{only by the}} middle and upper classes.

40|$|Back ground: HIV/AIDS, STI, and {{unwanted}} pregnancies are prevalent in higher institutions. To minimize this triple burden, an effective strategy is consistent <b>condom</b> <b>use.</b> Purpose: To assess determinant factors for consistent <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> among university students. Methods: A cross-sectional study design {{was conducted in}} March, 2012. A two-stage, stratified sampling method was employed for the selection of 576 study subjects. Hierarchical logistic regression was employed to identify determinate factors. Result: The findings showed 36. 5 % of students were sexually active. Of these, 53. 4 % reportedly <b>used</b> <b>condoms</b> during sexual intercourse and 55. 6 % <b>of</b> them reportedly <b>used</b> <b>condoms</b> irregularly. The multivariate logistic regression showed that sex/gender, students’ family residence, drinking alcohol, multiple sexual partners and khat chewing had an association on the intent <b>of</b> consistent <b>condom</b> <b>use.</b> Conclusion: Though there {{is an increase in}} the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> consistent <b>condom</b> <b>use,</b> large numbers <b>of</b> students are still at risk for acquiring HIV.

25|$|Some {{criticize the}} Church's {{teaching}} on fidelity, sexual abstinence and {{its opposition to}} promoting the use of condoms as a strategy {{to prevent the spread}} of HIV/AIDS (or teen pregnancy or STD) as counterproductive. The Roman Catholic Church has been both praised and criticized for its staunch pro-life efforts in all societies. The Church's denial of the use of condoms has provoked criticism especially in countries where AIDS and HIV infections are at epidemic proportions. The Church maintains that countries like Kenya where behavioral changes like abstinence are endorsed instead <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> <b>use,</b> are experiencing greater progress towards controlling the disease than those countries just promoting condoms.|$|E

These projects showed the feasibility of such programmes, which included condom use to control the spread of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in commercial sex workers, and have been officially promoted since 1998. Between 1999 and 2001, the World AIDS Foundation supported a five-site trial of a behavioral intervention in commercial sex workers who worked in entertainment establishments. The intervention included condom promotion, establishment of clinics for sexually transmitted diseases to provide check-ups, and outreach for health education and counseling. HIV-related knowledge improved substantially, {{and the rate of}} bacterial sexually transmitted diseases fell. The rate <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> at last intercourse increased from around 55% to 68%, and fewer commercial sex workers agreed to sex without a condom when requested by a client who offered more money. The prevalence of gonorrhea fell from about 26% at baseline to 4% after intervention, and the prevalence of chlamydia fell from about 41% to 26%.|$|E

An additional purpose was to examine specifically whether measures published in the correlational literature have improved over time. A systematic review of studies was undertaken and specific review criteria were used to guide the inclusion of studies. A final set of 56 studies that contained 72 measures <b>of</b> self-reported <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> were included in the review. These measures were coded and evaluated on 12 dimensions, including measure type, number of response categories, recall period, sex partner specificity, and sex act specificity. Results indicated a great amount of diversity in terms <b>of</b> how <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> has been measured in the literature. Although results indicated that measures published between 1996 and 2003 were of higher quality on a number of dimensions as compared to 1989 – 1995, a number of these gains were minimal and in some cases measures have decreased in quality. The overall conclusion is that the sexual risk behavior literature should implement more of the recommendations made by methodological scholars in this area.

Despite risk-reduction education campaigns directed to gay men since the early 1980 s, evidence shows continued deficits in condom-use skills and knowledge among gay men. Because most failures in the <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>condoms</b> are attributed to errors in use, increasing knowledge and skills in <b>condom</b> <b>use</b> is important in preventing HIV infection. Two groups of homosexual and bisexual men were sampled, those entering a risk-reduction education program and participants in a Gay Pride event. They were surveyed on their current sex practices and their efforts to reduce their risk of HIV infection. They were asked about their numbers of sex partners, specific sexual behaviors, <b>use</b> <b>of</b> <b>condoms,</b> types <b>of</b> <b>condoms</b> <b>used,</b> and lubricants used for genital-anal sex.

Among these first two groups, the spread of what HIV prevention experts labelled as "rumours" or "myths" about condoms were found to be common. Young people perceived the safety of safe sex to be influenced by the brand and cost <b>of</b> <b>condom</b> <b>used,</b> while Pentecostal religious leaders instead questioned the safety <b>of</b> <b>condoms</b> in general, <b>using</b> scientific data and tapping into media outlets to challenge their promotion as a viable way of ending the HIV epidemic in Namibia.
