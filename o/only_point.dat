5|$|Since the 2006acquisition of the Cherry Springs airport, a new Public Programming {{field has}} been {{established}} on the former airstrip. This field is northeast of PA Route 44 and is intended for educational programs or stargazing, but not for those who spend the night. Overnight observers and those with large telescopes use the Astronomy Field southwest of the highway. Nighttime visitors may only use flashlights with red filters, and may <b>only</b> <b>point</b> them at the ground. The Astronomy Field has further restrictions on lights, {{and parts of the}} park are light-free zones.|$|E
5|$|After Point Grey and Point Orient {{were turned}} over to the RVN on 14 July <b>only</b> <b>Point</b> Cypress and Point Marone were left in Division 13. On that day the {{remaining}} two cutters were given orders to report to the lower Mekong Delta and provide support for operations in the Than Phu Secret Zone. On 19 and 20 July the crews of both cutters consisted of a full complement of 13 RVN sailors and 5 Coast Guardsmen including the commanding officers. Kit Carson Scouts were also embarked, making the decks very crowded. The Scouts were put ashore on a search and destroy mission and the cutters backed them up with gunfire from their decks and the cutter small boats. The raid was successful, netting several captured Viet Cong troops and boxes of documents. A week later both cutters with Australian Army explosive ordnance disposal soldiers aboard cruised the My Thanh River and destroyed fortifications.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could <b>only</b> <b>point</b> directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} was to build a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} approach, the radii of the given circles are {{modified}} appropriately by an amount Δr so {{that two of}} them are tangential (touching). Their point of tangency is chosen as the center of inversion in a circle that intersects each of the two touching circles in two places. Upon inversion, the touching circles become two parallel lines: Their <b>only</b> <b>point</b> of intersection is sent to infinity under inversion, so they cannot meet. The same inversion transforms the third circle into another circle. The solution of the inverted problem must either be (1) a straight line parallel to the two given parallel lines and tangent to the transformed third given circle; or (2) a circle of constant radius that is tangent to the two given parallel lines and the transformed given circle. Re-inversion and adjusting the radii of all circles by Δr produces a solution circle tangent to the original three circles.|$|E
5|$|Ireland {{failed to}} qualify for Euro 96, despite a strong start to the group, when they won their opening three games, {{including}} a 4–0 win against Northern Ireland. The Republic's next game was also against Northern Ireland, although {{the result was a}} 1–1 draw. From that point onwards the Republic stuttered badly as injuries struck down key players such as Roy Keane, Andy Townsend, John Sheridan and Steve Staunton. After beating the highly fancied Portugal, the Irish then endured an embarrassing 0–0 draw to Liechtenstein (this was Liechtenstein's <b>only</b> <b>point</b> in their ten matches), before losing twice to Austria, on both occasions by three goals to one. Although they defeated Latvia, Ireland needed to beat Portugal in Lisbon to qualify outright, but lost 3–0. They finished second in the group, ahead of Northern Ireland on goal difference, but as the worst performing runners-up they had to win a play-off game at Anfield against the Netherlands; Ireland lost 2–0 after a brace from Patrick Kluivert. Charlton resigned shortly after the game.|$|E

25|$|Points {{were rare}} during this time; Pedro Lamy scored his one and <b>only</b> <b>point</b> in Formula 1 with a 6th {{place in the}} 1995 Australian Grand Prix; this result was {{followed}} by a long barren spell until Marc Gené finished 6th in the 1999 European Grand Prix. That same race, Luca Badoer had been running fourth until his gearbox failed with 13 laps to go, at which point the Italian burst into tears next to his stricken car. Other Minardi drivers also came close to scoring points, including Shinji Nakano who finished 7th at the 1998 Canadian Grand Prix and Esteban Tuero, who finished 8th at the 1998 San Marino Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|Van Barneveld was {{the victim}} of one of the biggest upsets in PDC World Championship history in 2012. He lost 0–3 in the first round to world number 85, James Richardson, winning just 4 legs during the match. He teamed up with Vincent van der Voort for the 2012 PDC World Cup of Darts to try to defend the title Van Barneveld won with Co Stompé in 2010. Together they enjoyed {{comfortable}} victories over Austria and Northern Ireland to set up a semi-final clash with the Australian pair of Paul Nicholson and Simon Whitlock.

25|$|TLC is an {{instance}} of a more general class of models known as semantic networks. In a semantic network, each node is to be interpreted as representing a specific concept, word, or feature. That is, each node is a symbol. Semantic networks generally do not employ distributed representations for concepts, as {{may be found in}} a neural network. The defining feature of a semantic network is that its links are almost always directed (that is, they <b>only</b> <b>point</b> in one direction, from a base to a target) and the links come in many different types, each one standing for a particular relationship that can hold between any two nodes. Processing in a semantic network often takes the form of spreading activation (see above).|$|E
25|$|The Tar Heels {{were shut}} {{out for the}} first time since a 7–0 loss to Georgia Tech in 2006, and their first shut out by NC State since 1960. Bryn Renner was knocked out of the game with concussion-like {{symptoms}} early in the second half. The UNC offense had its worst performance of the season, being held to a game low of 165 total yards. Giovani Bernard was, however, able to become the 15th Tar Heel to rush for 1,000 yards in a season and the third freshman to rush for 1,000 yards. The <b>only</b> <b>point</b> in the game in which it seemed UNC was going to put points on the scoreboard was on a 75 yard touchdown reception by Dwight Jones that was called back because of holding on the offensive line.|$|E
25|$|While {{these two}} attacks were going on, Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, {{commander}} of the Army of the Potomac and in temporary overall command while Grant was ill, became concerned that Lee was attempting to turn the left flank of the Union army. Historian John Horn wrote that if Grant {{had been on the}} scene, he might have very well ordered an attack on Petersburg at this point, similar to the tactic he would use in April 1865 that caused the fall of the city, taking advantage of the weakly defended lines vacated by the heavy force that Lee had sent to Reams Station. Meade, however, cautiously assumed a defensive stance and rushed reinforcements to his flank, thinning his own lines. The <b>only</b> <b>point</b> that Meade did not reinforce was the sector commanded by his trusty subordinate Hancock, assuming that Hancock would hold the line with his existing resources.|$|E

25|$|Once India regained {{control of}} the hills {{overlooking}} NH 1D, the Indian Army turned to driving the invading force back across the Line of Control. The Battle of Tololing, among other assaults, slowly tilted the combat in India's favour. The Pakistani troops at Tololing were aided by Pakistani fighters from Kashmir. Some of the posts put up a stiff resistance, including Tiger Hill (Point 5140) that fell only later in the war. Indian troops found well-entrenched Pakistani soldiers at Tiger Hill, and both sides suffered heavy casualties. After a final assault on the peak in which ten Pakistani soldiers and five Indian soldiers were killed, Tiger Hill finally fell. A few of the assaults occurred atop hitherto unheard of peaks – most of them unnamed with <b>only</b> <b>Point</b> numbers to differentiate them – which witnessed fierce hand to hand combat.|$|E
25|$|Hastings {{is served}} by State Highway , which connects Hastings with Napier, Wairoa and Gisborne {{to the north and}} (via Dannevirke) Wellington, Masterton and Palmerston North to the south. SH2 jumps over Hastings, as it is not {{recognised}} as a State Highway within the urban boundaries of the city. Due to the road layout of Hastings, SH2's northern and southern sections did not meet up. This is the <b>only</b> <b>point</b> in SH2's continuation where there is a gap, and it is not shown on maps. SH2 enters and exits Hastings in a north east and south west direction. Heading north east, it passes through residential Hastings, then follows the Clive River through the towns of Whakatu and Clive, bridges across the Clive, Tutaekuri and Ngaruroro Rivers before following the coast into Napier. Heading south west, it crosses the Heretaunga Plains, passing through Longlands and Pakipaki, then follows the railway south through Poukawa Valley.|$|E

She reached the second round at the Australian Open and French Open, made a first round exit at Wimbledon and reached {{the third round of}} the US Open. In 2000, she entered the top 20 by winning more than 40 singles matches for the second straight year and earned more than US$ 600,000. She became the first woman from Russia to reach the US Open semifinals in singles, where she lost to Lindsay Davenport. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Dementieva won the silver medal, losing to Venus Williams in the gold medal match 6–2, 6–4. In 2000, Dementieva was named the WTA tour's Most Improved Player.|$|E
