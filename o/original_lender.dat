5000|$|The {{transaction}} was complex, and {{the documentation}} {{was described as}} [...] "forbiddingly voluminous".

The payments under the various tranches of notes were intended to be protected by certain swap transactions which had been entered into the company with Lehman Brothers. But after the notes were issued, Lehman Brothers went into bankruptcy meaning that the company could not expect to receive payment under those swaps. The financial effect of this on the company was that although it could continue to meet its obligations for the time being, it would almost inevitably become unable to do so at a future point (because the company was a single purpose company there was no prospect of it trading out of its financial difficulties). The essential question for the court was whether this inevitable future shortfall means that the company could be treated as insolvent today, or whether it was necessary to wait until either it ran out of funds, or at least came close to doing so.|$|R
5000|$|Ideally, {{assuming}} a loan is properly paid back on time, a MERS loan needs only two documents to be recorded: the original mortgage or deed of trust naming Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc., and a reconveyance {{of the mortgage}} or deed of trust back to the borrower (thus merging legal and equitable title). If all entities along the way are MERSCORP Holdings, Inc. members, then all intermediate transfers between those points are tracked only on the MERS system, and the entity who holds the loan at the end merely records the reconveyance as an agent for MERSCORP Holdings, Inc. (Notice how MERS is both (1) an agent for the <b>original</b> <b>lender,</b> and then (2) the final lender acts as an agent for MERSCORP Holdings, Inc.; this is why MERS' critics frequently attack it as [...] "two-faced.") If the borrower defaults, the loan servicer will record an assignment on behalf of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. to the real party in interest (i.e., an investment bank in its capacity as trustee for a MBS) and initiate foreclosure.

Chief executive of Philadelphia Media Holdings, Mr. Tierney also became the publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer shortly after Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. Initially, there were concerns about Tierney's neutrality because of earlier roles he held working in Republican politics and clashes he had with some reporters. But Mr. Tierney calmed those fears by hiring respected journalist and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner William K. Marimow as editor of The Inquirer and by signing a pledge not to interfere with the editorial content of the two newspapers. Under Mr. Marimow, the editorial quality of The Inquirer improved as the paper returned to its roots by doing more investigative stories. Initially, circulation increased in 2007 and advertising sales improved. Meanwhile, the Daily News won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for investigative journalism for a series of stories on corrupt Philadelphia cops. However, the 2008 financial crisis led to a steep drop in advertising revenue. At the same time, circulation dropped as more readers migrated to the Internet. Newspaper values across the country plummeted by 90 percent or more. Mr. Tierney's group bought the paper {{at the top of the}} market and was saddled with a heavy debt burden.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Due to recent turmoil in U. S. credit markets, many lenders {{have been reluctant to}} offer conventional loans [...] that is, loans not guaranteed by the federal government [...] to small businesses so that they can finance their operations and capital needs. While the Small Business Administration's (SBA) principal loan guarantee programs, the 7 (a) and 504 programs, are intended to help small businesses raise critical financing that they may have difficulty obtaining from other sources, the availability of such loans has also declined. Under the 7 (a) program, SBA traditionally has provided lenders guarantees on up to 85 percent of the value of loans to qualifying small businesses in exchange for fees to help offset the costs of the program. Under the 504 program, which generally applies to small business real estate and other fixed assets, SBA provides certified development companies with a guarantee on up to 40 percent of the financing of the projects' costs in exchange for fees [...] the small business borrowers and other lenders provide the remaining 60 percent of the financing on an unguaranteed basis. Traditionally, lenders, such as banks, that participate in the 7 (a) or 504 programs often sell qualifying small business loans on the 7 (a) and 504 secondary markets to raise funds necessary for additional lending. However, from mid- 2008 to early- 2009, investors that had typically purchased securities collateralized by the pools of 7 (a) guaranteed small business loans and certain 504 loans largely withdrew from the secondary markets due to potential losses, and as a result, many such loans remained on the balance sheets of the broker-dealers that package the securities or on the balance sheets of the <b>original</b> <b>lenders.</b> According to SBA, the dollar volume of 7 (a) loans sold as securities on the secondary market dropped from $ 425. 4 million to $ 85. 9 million, or 79. 8 percent, {{from the end of the}} third quarter of 2008 to the end of the first quarter of 2009.

The provisions included requirements for, among other things, (1) temporarily lowering or eliminating certain fees on 7 (a) and 504 loans, as well as increasing the maximum guarantee on the former; (2) establishing new programs to facilitate secondary market activity; and (3) establishing a new, temporary guaranteed loan program for viable small businesses experiencing financial hardship, which SBA refers to as the America's Recovery Capital (ARC) Loan Program.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{theoretical}} {{study of the}} role of credit market imperfections in business cycle dynamics. In particular, Chapters 2 to 4 focus on the credit channel of the monetary transmission mechanism, while Chapter 5 studies the role of shocks to credit markets in generating business cycle dynamics. The common framework used throughout the thesis is a New Keynesian (NK) framework characterised by imperfect competition and staggered pricesetting. The essence of the credit channel of monetary transmission is endogenous movements in the external finance premium, which, in turn, are caused by endogenous movements of agency costs generated in the presence of credit frictions. The credit channel works to complement the interest rate channel inherent to the standard NK model. Chapter 2 aims to shed light on the workings of the credit channel by presenting an analytical solution for the simplied case where agency costs are modelled acyclical. I show that when acyclical agency costs are incorporated into an otherwise standard NK model, they amplify the real impact of money shocks but reduce the persistence of the real effects. This happens because credit frictions flatten both aggregate supply (AS) and aggregate demand (AD) relations of the model, where the former is essentially the New Keynesian Phillips curve while the latter is derived from the consumption Euler equation and money market equilibrium condition. Chapter 3 replaces the assumption of economy-wide input markets made in Chapter 2 with the one of segmented input markets. The reason for doing this is twofold. First, the latter assumption seems to capture the reality better. Second, the previous literature shows that the segmented market assumption is a crucial determinant for the degree of the persistence of the real effects of money shocks. I show that for given agency costs, both the real impact of money shocks and the persistence of the real effects are much greater in a model with the segmented input market assumption. This happens because the new assumption greatly flattens the AS curve. Chapter 4 directly studies the workings of the endogenous agency costs. Focusing on credit frictions in borrowing by firms (entrepreneurs), it compares the different business cycle dynamics generated by two alternative modelling strategies. The first assumes that entrepreneurs make a consumption/saving decision to maximise their intertemporal utility, but have a higher discount rate than households (<b>original</b> <b>lenders).</b> The second assumes that a constant fraction of entrepreneurs die each period and they consume all the accumulated wealth just before their death. These assumptions are widely used in the literature to keep agency costs operative. I show that the choice of the modelling strategies is key to the way the credit channel operates within the NK framework. Chapter 5 investigates the effect of shocks to credit markets on business cycle dynamics. Using the framework developed in Chapter 2, I show that shocks to credit markets affect agency costs and thus the external finance premium faced by entrepreneurs (borrowers). In turn, this causes a change in output. Then, turning to the framework developed in Chapter 4 with endogenous agency costs, I highlight that there is a feedback effect from macroeconomic conditions to the premium through endogenous developments in entrepreneurs' net worth. The change in the premium caused by the feedback effect leads to the further change in output. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Commonly {{employed}} in corporate rescue situations, the Quistclose trust (from Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd [1970] AC 567) is {{a device that}} enables an investor to advance funds to a troubled company {{to be used for}} a specific purpose. If the recipient company becomes insolvent before the money is spent then the funds will be held on trust for the <b>original</b> <b>lender,</b> thus ensuring that the property is not available for distribution amongst the company's unsecured creditors. This thesis examines both the theory and context of Quistclose trusts. It is argued that, whilst the devices are most commonly found in insolvency situations, the Quistclose analysis should be available wherever property is transferred for a specific purpose. Thus the paper identifies and discusses such issues as the 'requirement' of segregation of the trust property, the specificity of purpose necessary, and the type of property that may be subject to a Quistclose trust. The context of the Quistclose trust is also examined by reference to other security devices: equitable charges and retention of title agreements. Similarities and differences are identified and analysed in the context of insolvency regimes: should Quistclose trusts be subject to legislative controls, given their apparent ability to circumvent legislative provisions? Various commentators have attempted to categorise Quistclose trusts as express trusts, resulting trusts, sui generis trusts, or even full beneficial transfers coupled with equitable rights to restrain misuse. Following consideration of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each proposal it is argued that Quistclose trusts can indeed be reconciled with accepted principle. However, it is also suggested that there is no single correct classification: depending on the most accurate construction of the parties' actions and intentions the proper analysis may involve an express trust, a resulting trust, or indeed no trust at all...|$|E
40|$|Executive summary Techniques for {{transferring}} credit risk, such {{as financial}} guarantees and credit insurance, {{have been a}} long-standing feature of financial markets. In the past few years, however, the range of credit risk transfer (CRT) instruments and {{the circumstances in which}} they are used have widened considerably. A number of factors have contributed to this growth, including: greater focus by banks and other financial institutions on risk management; a more rigorous approach to risk/return judgments by lenders and investors and an increasing tendency on the part of banks to look at their credit risk exposures on a portfolio-wide basis; efforts by market intermediaries to generate fee income; a generally low interest rate environment, which has encouraged firms to search for yield pickup through broadening the range of instruments they are prepared to hold; and arbitrage opportunities arising from different regulatory capital requirements applied to different kinds of financial firm. The significance of CRT seems to vary appreciably across firms and market segments. Thus, for example, the intermediation of credit default swaps seems to be a major business line for a small, but only a small, number of firms; and CRT markets are particularly active for major company credits, much less so for SMEs. Given these differences, it may be misleading to talk about the overall impact of CRT. However, while CRT flows have been substantial, and despite recent growth, CRT activity seems still to be relatively small compared with the outstanding stocks, and even the current flows, of credit-riskrelated instruments. After setting out some of the broader background (Section II), this Report reviews the recent development of CRT markets, describing the characteristics of the instruments used, the nature of the market participants and the reasons for their involvement (Section III). It then discusses some of the principal features of the markets themselves, focusing on the questions of transparency and data availability, on how CRT instruments of different kinds are priced and on how far the existence of CRT markets has affected the process of price discovery (Section IV). The remainder of the Report (Sections V, VI and VII) identifies and analyses some possible implications of the evolution of CRT markets for the overall functioning of the financial system and discusses some of the concerns which have been expressed about the impact of CRT on financial stability. CRT instruments typically change the relationship between borrowers and lenders and establish new relationships between lenders and those to whom they may pass on credit risk (Section V). This implies in particular changes in the incentives which the different parties to a credit transaction face. The Report analyses these changes in terms of potential market failures, for example asymmetric information, principal/agent problems and incomplete contracts. It concludes that most of these problems have been recognised by market participants and market authorities and have been addressed in one way or another. In some cases, however, it has proved difficult or impossible to arrive at an entirely satisfactory solution. One common approach is to ensure that the risk shedder retains some interest in the performance of the borrower and therefore some incentive to monitor the borrower’s performance carefully. Such retention can, however, diminish the attraction of CRT transactions in so far as regulators may not recognise the risk transfer for capital requirement purposes unless it is complete. A further problem has proved to be the formulation of contracts in a way which is unambiguous in all plausible circumstances. In a number of cases a situation has arisen which was not anticipated at the time a contract was drawn up and in which the interests of the parties to the contract have diverged. At one level this is a legal/documentation issue, and some worthwhile progress has been made, in this and in other areas, by developing the standard ISDA contract. Further improvements could no doubt be introduced. Some especially difficult issues arise, however, in relation to the definition of "restructurings" and their inclusion as credit events. At present {{it is not clear how}} far these are capable of being resolved by legal drafting and how far they reflect deeper problems of contract design. In any case, there remains a concern that those who believe they have shed risk could sometimes find that they have not, and that those who believe they are not at risk may find that they are. The Report considers (in Section VI) some structural implications of the wider use of CRT. In particular, it notes that rating agencies play a central role in some CRT markets. To an extent this is no different from the role which they already play in the rating of corporate debt (and indeed the market in single name credit derivatives is, broadly speaking, confined to names which are already rated). But the rating agencies arguably have an even more important role in relation to portfolio instruments, and their models have set market standards for credit risk assessment of such instruments. While the analytical basis for these assessments has been advancing, there are still some significant unresolved questions, notably about the way diversification effects should be handled. This in turn implies some uncertainty about the pricing of the instruments themselves. CRT also has a potentially major impact on the way that banks go about their business. Increasingly, they are acting as credit originators rather than long-term funders, shifting loans off their balance sheet either individually or as part of a package through loan transfers and securitisation. In some cases, however, they continue to act in an agency capacity in terms of monitoring and servicing the loans. While these trends now seem firmly established, they have so far had only a relatively small impact on the profile of business for the banking sector as a whole, with a possible exception in the area of credit card receivables and mortgages in some countries. Innovation in financial markets, and within that the development of new financial instruments such as credit derivatives, is generally to be welcomed as increasing market efficiency, enabling better diversification of portfolios and providing a wider range of techniques for risk management. However, there are a number of aspects of CRT which raise policy issues and which, at least in some cases, might point to the need for a policy response (Section VII). Some of the main ones are as follows: Transparency - financial firms’ disclosure of their CRT activities is patchy at best. In a fastdeveloping market with a potentially significant effect on the distribution of risks this lack of disclosure is a concern. The Report suggests that the issue might best be addressed by lending support to existing initiatives on disclosure (eg Fisher II) and by flagging the specific concerns in relation to CRT. Aggregate data - the relative dearth of information at the level of the individual firm is paralleled by an incomplete picture of how CRT markets are developing in aggregate. Central banks and others are currently exploring how to improve their database related to CRT instruments without imposing an undue reporting burden on market practitioners. Rating agencies - the Report notes the critical role of rating agencies in various CRT markets and the implicit reliance on the risk assessment techniques which they use. Although the Report does not formulate any view on the desirability or otherwise of this state of affairs, the CRT dimension should be taken into account in the various reviews of the rating agencies’ activities which are at present in progress. Diversification and concentration - one of the principal potential benefits of CRT is that it facilitates the wider dispersion of risk and allows risk profiles to be adjusted more flexibly. At the same time, some elements of the CRT market appear to be highly concentrated, which might give rise to market disruption if the firms concerned were to come under pressure. Contract design - as previously noted, the formulation of restructuring clauses in credit derivatives contracts has proved to be particularly problematic. It remains to be seen whether the difficulties can be resolved; if not, it could act as a significant brake on the further development of this part of the CRT market. Risk management - although in many respects CRT involves familiar risk management issues, it does sharpen questions about counterparty risk in relation to unfunded risk transfers, given the speed and scale of possible changes in exposures, and also raises technical questions about the reliability of pricing of portfolio instruments. In addition, there are a number of issues related to documentation on which further work is needed. More fundamentally, there has been concern that CRT could lead to a weakening in overall credit risk monitoring if those who end up holding the credit risk have less information about the borrower than the <b>original</b> <b>lender.</b> Market practice has, however, evolved in a number of ways to mitigate this risk. Accounting - divergences in accounting rules have had a restraining effect on certain parts of the CRT market. As credit risk (at least vis-à-vis larger borrowers) becomes more readily tradable, it may also increase the tension between book value and mark to market valuation. Although the Report did not explore this (contentious) issue it is clear that it is attracting increasing attention from practitioners. Regulation - CRT has the potential to highlight more clearly differences in the regulatory treatment of credit risk as between different kinds of institution and is, therefore, likely to work towards a more integrated approach to regulatory capital standards. The International Association of Insurance Supervisors and the UK Financial Services Authority have recently reviewed the regulatory implications of CRT. ...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays covering topics in empirical corporate finance {{with an emphasis on}} banking relationships and its effect on liquidity constraints and business growth. In particular, it investigates the effect of monetary capital and human capital constraints and the role of banking relationships to relax both constraints. The first essay studies how the number of bank relationships affects the liquidity constraints of businesses. The second essay investigates how accounting training can affect the liquidity constraints of entrepreneurs finally the third essay studies the effect of credit insurance as a mechanisms to reduce liquidity constraints. Further details of each essay are included below: In Chapter 1, I empirically explore whether firms have a target for the number of banks from which they borrow, and whether having multiple bank relationships has an impact on firms' liquidity situation. A bank merger in Chile provides a quasi-experiment as it constitutes an exogenous {{reduction in the number of}} lenders for firms that were previously borrowing from both merging banks. I find that a significant percentage of firms whose number of bank relationships was reduced by the merger regain their <b>original</b> number of <b>lenders.</b> In particular, firms whose number of bank lending relationships was reduced from 2 to 1 as a result of the merger have a 23 % higher probability of adding a new bank lending relationship in the 5 years following the merger compared to similar firms unaffected by the merger. (cont.) Overall, I find that a reduction in firms' number of bank lenders resulting from the merger reduced firms' access to credit. In particular, a reduction from two to one bank lending relationship on average generated a 14. 4 % decrease in loan size for the affected companies compared to firms unaffected by the merger. In Chapter 2 (joint work with Antoinette Schoar and Greg Fischer) We conduct a randomized impact evaluation of a training program for micro-entrepreneurs in the Dominican Republic that allows us to identify the effects of cash management and accounting techniques on business practices and business performance. To a randomly-selected fraction of the entrepreneurs enrolled in the training program we also provided on-site accounting and cash management advice. We find that micro entrepreneurs are reluctant to incorporate complex and time-consuming accounting practices into their businesses, however, simpler cash flow management practices were widely adopted by trained entrepreneurs. People who were taught basic cash flow management techniques increased their sales up to 80 %. The increase in sales during bad performance periods was substantially more significant than the average increase in sales. This suggests that the most important mechanism through which training improved performance was by reducing the effect of drawbacks in the businesses. Complex accounting techniques only increased sales when combined with on-site advice, most likely because these practices where not consistently implemented when on-site advice was not provided. (cont.) In Chapter 3 (joint work with Kevin Cowan and Alvaro Yafies), we use Partial Credit Guarantee Schemes in Chile to study how such a government intervention in the financial system can affect the access that entrepreneurs have to the formal financial system. We also explore how these schemes affect the default rates on the guaranteed loans. We find that partial credit guarantee schemes increase the number of loans and the aggregate amount lent to small and medium size businesses. In addition, we find that credit guarantees increase the debt capacity of individual entrepreneurs, holding assets fixed. We also find that Credit Guarantees increase default rates, but the evidence suggests that this result is explained mainly by misalignment of bank incentives rather than moral hazard in the context of client practices. by Alejandro Herman Drexler.
