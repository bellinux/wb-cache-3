50|$|Normally the {{seedling}} radicle (root) emerges {{first from}} the seed, and <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> appears as <b>the</b> root becomes established. Later, with growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> (particularly when it emerges into the light) there is increased secondary root formation and branching. In this coordinated progression of developmental responses are early manifestations of correlative growth phenomena where the root affects <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> and vice versa. To a large degree, the growth responses are hormone mediated.|$|R

5|$|The {{five men}} {{were charged with}} {{terrorism}} aimed at undermining authority on 29 October. The investigation was led by Gagik Jhangiryan, the Chief Military Prosecutor of Armenia, who claimed his team {{was looking for the}} masterminds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> even after the trial had begun. According to Jhangiryan, the investigating team considered more than a dozen theories. By January 2000, Jhangiryan's investigators considered the connection of Kocharyan and his circle to the parliament shooting. Several figures close to Kocharyan were arrested, including Aleksan Harutiunyan, the Deputy Presidential Adviser, and Harutiun Harutiunyan, the Deputy Director of the Public Television of Armenia but, by the summer of that year, they were released. Eventually, Jhangiryan failed to find evidence linking Kocharyan to the shooting. The trial began in February 2001 and eventually, the five main perpetrators <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> (Nairi Hunanyan, his younger brother Karen Hunanyan, their uncle Vram Galstyan, Derenik Ejanyan and Eduard Grigoryan) were {{sentenced to life in prison}} on December 2, 2003.|$|E

40|$|During the prebloom and bloom stages, no {{movement}} of labeled photosynthates occurred from a shoot of Vitis vinifera L. fed with 14 CO 2, to an adjacent <b>shoot</b> on <b>the</b> same spur. Movement of labeled assimilates into <b>the</b> unfed <b>shoot</b> was induced when this shoot was sprayed with 2. 89 × 10 − 3 m gibberellic acid during the prebloom stage. During the bloom stage darkening or defoliation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unfed <b>shoot</b> resulted in <b>the</b> import <b>of</b> labeled photosynthates from <b>the</b> adjacent fed <b>shoot.</b> Similarly, movement of 14 C into an untreated shoot was induced {{by removing the}} terminal 7. 5 centimeters and deblossoming <b>the</b> fed <b>shoot.</b> During <b>the</b> berry set stage, translocation of labeled photosynthates from a newly exporting leaf was upwards to <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> tip, but <b>the</b> direction <b>of</b> movement was reversed by removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> tip or by darkening or removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> leaves below the fed leaf. Translocation of photosynthates was predominantly basipetal from a fed leaf near <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> during <b>the</b> berry set stage, but upward movement was induced by darkening or defoliation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot...</b>|$|R
5|$|At {{the scene}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> Scully reasons {{that at the}} short range from which Goodensnake was shot, {{it would have been}} {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human to something more animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E
5|$|Bisley and Henley {{had both}} been {{previously}} used as venues during the 1908 Games. Bisley hosted most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> events while Henley hosted the rowing competition. Henley continues {{to host the}} Royal Regatta, which started in 1839, and remains in use as of 2010 for global competition, including the Diamond Sculls event. The Harringay Arena was built in 1928 and staged sporting events until its demolition in 1958. Built in 1891, the Herne Hill Velodrome hosted track cycling. After falling into disrepair by 2011, a modernization plan was implemented to make extensive structural repairs to the site and install a new track surface {{so that it could}} used by British Cycling, the national sport governing body.|$|E
5|$|Born on January 16, 1980, Pujols {{was raised}} in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, mostly by his grandmother, America Pujols, and 10 of his uncles and aunts. He was an only child. His father, Bienvenido Pujols, was a {{softball}} pitcher, {{but he was also}} an alcoholic. Albert often had to take his father home when his father got drunk following the games. Growing up, Pujols practiced baseball using limes for balls and a milk carton for a glove. Pujols, his father, and his grandmother immigrated in 1996 to New York City, where Albert witnessed a shooting at a grocery store. Partly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> they moved to Independence, Missouri, two months later to join some relatives.|$|E
50|$|Principal {{photography}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film commenced in April 2016. <b>The</b> <b>shooting</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film went on floors after <b>the</b> Punjabi festival <b>of</b> Vaisakhi 2016. First day <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> was on 19 April 2016.|$|R

40|$|Phytoremediation, using {{plants to}} extract heavy metals, such as Cd, from {{contaminated}} soils, is an emerging technology. Experiments {{were conducted in}} order to investigate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> Cd concentration in soil on growth and <b>the</b> absorption <b>of</b> Cd, Zn, and Cu by <b>the</b> <b>shoots.</b> <b>The</b> experiments were conducted on 8 Asteraceae species using Cd concentrations of 3. 4, 6. 5, and 9. 5 μg g- 1 of dry soil. A higher Cd concentration in the soil resulted {{in an increase in}} the Cd concentration in <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 8 species and an increase in the dry weight and Cd absorption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> Pericallis hybrida, Crepis rubra, and Gazania spp. The higher Cd absorption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> increased Zn absorption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shoot</b> in Pericallis hybrida and Crepis rubra, and Cu absorption of that in Cosmos bipinnatus, Crepis rubra and Gazania spp. It is suggested that Pericallis hybrida, Crepis rubra, and Gazania spp. are suitable for Cd phytoremediation and that Cd accumulation in <b>the</b> <b>shoots</b> <b>of</b> Crepis rubra and Gazania spp., led to <b>the</b> accumulation <b>of</b> Zn and Cu...|$|R
5|$|Earlier {{on the day}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting,</b> Loughner {{reportedly}} had an altercation {{with his}} father regarding a black bag the younger man took from a car trunk. A bag matching the description was later found in a nearby desert area containing 9mm ammunition, and it is believed to belong to Loughner. Later that morning, at approximately 7:30a.m., Loughner was stopped by an Arizona Game and Fish Department officer after running a red light, but was released with a reminder when {{it was determined that}} he did not have any outstanding warrants.|$|E
5|$|Federal {{officials}} charged Loughner {{the next}} day with killing federal government employees, attempting to assassinate a member of Congress and attempting to kill federal employees.

5|$|Filming {{continued}} at Fox (where most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>shooting</b> was done) and New Orleans, Louisiana. Cockatoo Island {{was used for}} Stryker's facility; the enormous buildings there saved money on digitally expanding a set. Production of the film was predicted to generate A$60million for Sydney's economy. Principal photography ended by May 23. The second unit continued filming in New Zealand until March 23, and were scheduled to continue filming for two weeks following the first unit's wrap. This included a flashback to Logan during the Normandy Landings, which was shot at Blacksmiths, New South Wales.|$|E
