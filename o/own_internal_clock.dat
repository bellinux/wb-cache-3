50|$|In Arabidopsis thaliana, {{the signal}} is {{initiated}} by the production of messenger RNA (mRNA) coding a transcription factor called CONSTANS (CO). CO mRNA is produced approximately 12 hours after dawn, a cycle regulated by the plant's biological clock. This mRNA is then translated into CO protein. However CO protein is stable only in light, so levels stay low throughout short days and are only able to peak at dusk during long days when {{there is still a}} little light. CO protein promotes transcription of another gene called Flowering Locus T (FT). By this mechanism, CO protein may only reach levels capable of promoting FT transcription when exposed to long days. Hence, the transmission of florigen—and thus, the induction of flowering—relies on a comparison between the plant's perception of day/night and its <b>own</b> <b>internal</b> biological <b>clock.</b>|$|R

40|$|We study {{synthesis}} of controllers for real-time systems, where {{the objective is}} to stay in a given safe set. The problem is solved by obtaining winning strategies in concurrent two-player timed automaton games with safety objectives. To prevent a player from winning by blocking time, we restrict each player to strategies that ensure that the player cannot be responsible for causing a zeno run. We construct winning strategies for the controller which require access only to (1) the system clocks (thus, controllers which require their <b>own</b> <b>internal</b> infinitely precise <b>clocks</b> are not necessary), and (2) a linear (in the number of clocks) number of memory bits. Precisely, we show that a memory of size (3 ·|C|+ 1 + (|C|+ 1)) bits suffices for winning controller strategies for safety objectives, where C is the set of clocks of the timed automaton game, significantly improving the previous known exponential bound. We also settle the open question of whether region strategies for controllers require memory for safety objectives by showing with an example that region strategies do require memory for safety objectives.

5000|$|Another {{example of}} the use of these {{concepts}} is digital audio technology. A tape recorder, digital audio editor, or other device that is online is one whose clock is {{under the control of the}} clock of a synchronization master device. When the sync master commences playback, the online device automatically synchronizes itself to the master and commences playing from the same point in the recording. A device that is offline uses no external clock reference and relies upon its <b>own</b> <b>internal</b> <b>clock.</b> When a large number of devices are connected to a sync master it is often convenient, if one wants to hear just the output of one single device, to take it offline because, if the device is played back online, all synchronized devices have to locate the playback point and wait for each other device to be in synchronization.

40|$|The article {{describes}} the origins and development of <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> theory. The history is traced via body temperature studies in the 1920 s and 1930 s, with input from 19 th. century and early 20 th. century psychophysics, through to the landmark model of Treisman (1963). This model derived timed behaviour from an interaction of <b>internal</b> <b>clock,</b> memory store, and comparison processes. A successor to Treisman's model was the scalar expectancy theory (SET) of Gibbon and colleagues (1984). The origins of SET in animal Psychology are described, as is its application to human timing (in the early 1990 s), in particular recent work on {{the operation of the}} <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> itself. Finally, a discussion of some recent developmental studies of timing illustrates both how <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> models have been applied, and how modern research may require a reconceptualization of the operation of classical <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> models. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{appearance}} of the Hamiltonian constraint in the canonical formalism for general relativity reflects {{the lack of a}} fixed external time. The dynamics of general relativistic systems can be expressed with respect to an arbitrarily chosen internal degree of freedom, the so-called <b>internal</b> <b>clock.</b> We investigate {{the way in which the}} choice of <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> determines the quantum dynamics and how much different quantum dynamics induced by different clocks are. We develop our method of comparison by extending the Hamilton–Jacobi theory of contact transformations to include a new type of transformation which transforms both the canonical variables and the <b>internal</b> <b>clock.</b> We employ our method to study the quantum dynamics of the Friedmann–Lemaitre model and obtain semiclassical corrections to the classical dynamics, which depend on the choice of <b>internal</b> <b>clock.</b> For a unique quantisation map we find the abundance of inequivalent semiclassical corrections induced by quantum dynamics taking place in different <b>internal</b> <b>clocks.</b> It follows that the concepts like minimal volume, maximal curvature and the number of quantum bounces, often used to describe quantum effects in cosmological models, depend on the choice of <b>internal</b> <b>clock...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{existence}} of an <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> and its involvement in information processing has been investigated in humans using the experimental protocol of Treisman et al. (1990) [Treisman et al., 1990. Perception, 19, 705 – 743]. In this protocol, a periodical stimulation, which is assumed to drive an <b>internal</b> <b>clock,</b> is delivered during a reaction time (RT) task. The accelerating or slowing down effects of the periodical stimulation, according to its frequency, allowed an estimate {{to be made of}} a simple harmonic of the frequency of the <b>internal</b> <b>clock.</b> The estimate was close to 21 Hz. In the framework of the serial model of information processing, the present work investigates the involvement of the <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> in the transmission of information between processing stages during RT. The data tend to support the idea that the <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> allows the transfer of information from one stage to the next one at definite moments only, periodically distributed in time. According to our results, and recent data from the literature on electric cortical oscillations, we propose a model of an <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> sending periodic inhibition, which would permit an increased signal/noise ratio in the processing and the transmission of information in the central nervous system...|$|R
30|$|Synchronization is an {{essential}} part of the analysis. Since traces are generated on multiple machines by different instances of tracers, we have no guaranty that a time stamp for an event in a first trace will have any sense in the context of a second trace. Each machine may have its own timing sources, from the software interrupt timer to the cycle counter. When tracing the operating system kernel, each system instance (i.e., host, VM, container, etc.) uses its <b>own</b> <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> to specify the events time stamps. But, in order to have a common sense of all systems behaviors, which are recorded as trace events separately in each system, it is essential to properly measure the differences and drifts between these machines.|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} work we introduced a self-synchronized duty-cycling mechanism for mobile sensor networks with energy harvesting capabilities, {{inspired by the}} self-synchroned sleeping patterns that {{can be observed in}} real ant colonies. The focus of our previous study was mainly on swarm intelligence aspects of the proposed system. In contrast, in this paper we propose a more realistic version of the initial system. The proposed changes concern in particular the systems’ asynchronous simulation. Instead of exchanging information at the same time, in our new proposal sensor nodes wake up periodically based on their <b>own</b> <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> and perform an update of their internal state based on the information received by their neighbors. In addition we use a more realistic mobility model and apply the system to scenarios where weather conditions vary over the area of deployment. The simulation results show that our asynchronous system also permits adaptive duty-cycling, and that the system is able to adapt to changing weather conditions.

40|$|Saccadic chronostasis {{refers to}} the {{subjective}} temporal lengthening of the first visual stimulus perceived after an eye movement. It has been quantified using a duration discrimination task. Most models of human duration discrimination hypothesise an <b>internal</b> <b>clock.</b> These models could explain chronostasis as a transient increase in <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> speed due to arousal following a saccade, leading to temporal overestimation. Two experiments are described which addressed this hypothesis by parametrically varying {{the duration of the}} stimuli that are being judged. Changes in <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> speed predict chronostasis effects proportional to stimulus duration. No evidence for proportionality was found. Two further experiments assessed the appropriateness of the control conditions employed. Results indicated that the chronostasis effect is constant across a wide range of stimulus durations and does not reflect the pattern of visual stimulation experienced during a saccade, suggesting that arousal is not critical. Instead, alternative processes, such as one affecting the onset of timing (i. e., the time of <b>internal</b> <b>clock</b> switch closure) are implicated. Further research is required to select between these alternatives...|$|R
