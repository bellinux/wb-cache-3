5|$|The 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin {{were the}} first Games to be {{broadcast}} on television, though only to local audiences. The 1956 Winter Olympics {{were the first}} internationally televised Olympic Games, and the following Winter Games had their broadcasting rights sold {{for the first time}} to specialised television broadcasting networks—CBS paid US$394,000 for the American rights, and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) allocated US$660,000. In the following decades the Olympics became one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideological</b> fronts of the Cold War. Superpowers jockeyed for political supremacy, and the IOC wanted to take advantage of this heightened interest via the broadcast medium. The sale of broadcast rights enabled the IOC to increase the exposure of the Olympic Games, thereby generating more interest, which in turn created more appeal to advertisers time on television. This cycle allowed the IOC to charge ever-increasing fees for those rights. For example, CBS paid US$375million for the rights of the 1998 Nagano Games, while NBC spent US$3.5billion for the broadcast rights of all the Olympic Games from 2000 to 2012.|$|E

25|$|Barruel's polemic is an {{important}} source for {{the understanding of the}} mentality of the opponents of the French Revolution and their understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideological</b> origins of the Revolution. Furthermore, Barruel is also seen as the father of a modern conspiracy theory. The Memoirs contain all of the elements that continue to characterize conspiracy narratives today including the argument that a hidden group is orchestrating world events behind the scenes and an attempt to construct a direct lineage from the past to the present. Barruel presents a thorough application of conspiracy theory methodology. As a result, he has had a lasting influence on following generations.|$|E

25|$|In direct {{contrast}} to German philosophy, which descends from heaven to earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven. That is to say, {{we do not}} set out from what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and {{on the basis of}} their real life process we demonstrate the development <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideological</b> reflexes and echoes of this life process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this, their real existence, their thinking, and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life.|$|E
25|$|Kersten was {{succeeded by}} , under whose {{leadership}} the SGP was very stable, continually getting 2% of votes. In the 1956 election, the SGP profited from the enlargement of Parliament, {{and entered the}} Senate for the first time. It lost that seat in 1960, but regained it in 1971. In 1961 Zandt died and was succeeded by , a chemist. After ten years he stood down in favour of Reverend Hette Abma, who also stepped down after ten years, in favour of Henk van Rossum, a civil engineer. In the 1984 European Parliament election, the SGP joined the two other orthodox Protestant parties (the Reformatory Political Federation (RPF) and the Reformed Political League (GPV)). They won one seat in the European Parliament, which was taken by SGP member Leen van der Waal, a mechanical engineer. In 1986, Van Rossum was succeeded by Bas van der Vlies, who led the party till March 2010, when he was succeeded by Kees van der Staaij. In the 1994 election the party lost one seat in the House, regained it in 1998, and lost it again in 2002. After the general election of 2003, the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) held talks with the SGP — {{the first time in}} recent history that the SGP was seriously considered as a possible coalition partner. Ultimately, the Democrats 66 joined the Second Balkenende cabinet instead of the SGP, mostly because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideological</b> differences between VVD and SGP.|$|E

500|$|While non-Chinese analysts {{generally}} {{agree that}} the CCP has rejected orthodox Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought (or at least basic thoughts within orthodox thinking), the CCP itself disagrees. Certain groups argue that Jiang Zemin ended the CCP's formal commitment to Marxism with the introduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideological</b> theory, the Three Represents. However, party theorist Leng Rong disagrees, claiming that [...] "President Jiang rid the Party <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideological</b> obstacles to different kinds of ownership [...] He did not give up Marxism or socialism. He strengthened the Party by providing a modern understanding of Marxism and socialism—which is why we talk about a 'socialist market economy' with Chinese characteristics." [...] The attainment of true [...] "communism" [...] is still described as the CCP's and China's [...] "ultimate goal". While the CCP claims that China is in the primary stage of socialism, party theorists argue that the current development stage [...] "looks a lot like capitalism". Alternatively, certain party theorists argue that [...] "capitalism is the early or first stage of communism." [...] Some have dismissed {{the concept of a}} primary stage of socialism as intellectual cynicism. According to Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a China analyst, [...] "When I first heard this rationale, I thought it more comic than clever—a wry caricature of hack propagandists leaked by intellectual cynics. But the 100-year horizon comes from serious political theorists".|$|E
500|$|Animal epithets may be pejorative, {{indeed in}} some {{cultures}} highly offensive. Epithets are sometimes used in political campaigns; in 1890, the trades unionist Chummy Fleming marched {{with a group}} of unemployed people through the streets of Melbourne, displaying a banner with the message [...] "Feed on our flesh and blood you capitalist hyenas: it is your funeral feast". On the other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideological</b> divide, the Cuban government described the revolutionary Che Guevara as a [...] "communist rat" [...] in 1958. Epithets are not limited to mammals; for instance, comparing someone to a snail means they are (extremely) slow, while calling them a slug implies they are lazy and loathsome. Frog is pejorative for French people in English, from the use of frogs' legs in French cuisine.|$|E

500|$|In early 1944, the SS {{directed}} {{the governments of}} Hungary and the Slovak State to transfer to the Waffen-SS all the Volksdeutsche serving in their armed forces. This amounted to another 50,000 troops. During 1944, Berger gave a speech in which he advocated a [...] "Germanic Reich" [...] that included all the countries that had Germanic or Nordic populations. He said, [...] "Since the Schutzstaffel {{was taken over by}} the Reichsführer-SS in 1929, its long-term goal has been the Germanic Reich. This long-term goal inevitably forms part of the SS claim to be a formation of Nordic men. It cannot be stopped by artificially drawn boundaries". He was also concerned that the SS was losing its previous dominance in ideological matters, as the Wehrmacht had largely adopted the ideological maxims of the SS. This narrowing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideological</b> gap between the Waffen-SS and the Army was of considerable concern to SS leaders such as Berger, as it undermined the legitimacy of the SS as the leaders of the Nazi project.|$|E
