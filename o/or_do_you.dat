The controversy led to accusations of Nazi sympathizing which have followed Slayer throughout their career. People took Hanneman's interest in Nazi history and his collection of Nazi medals, his most prized item being a German Knight's Cross, as evidence of sympathizing. Hanneman objected, stating: [...] According to guitarist Kerry King: [...] "Yeah, 'Slayer are Nazis, fascists, Communists'—all that fun shit. And of course we got the most flak for it in Germany. I was always like, 'Read the lyrics and tell me what's offensive about it. Can you see it as a documentary, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think Slayer's preaching fucking World War II?' People get this thought in their heads—especially in Europe—and you'll never talk them out of it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{referendum}} {{question which}} the party proposed was announced on 28 November 1996: [...] "Do {{you want the}} United Kingdom {{to be part of}} a federal Europe <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> want the United Kingdom to return to an association of sovereign nations that are part of a common trading market?" [...] The political scientists David Butler and Dennis Kavanagh noted that this question was often mocked for its [...] "unrealistic ambiguity", and some journalists referred to Goldsmith's venture as the [...] "Referendum Only Party". Goldsmith did not position the party as explicitly opposed to the EU, instead stating that it was [...] "wholly agnostic" [...] about EU membership and just wanted to secure a referendum on the issue. However, the wording of the party's main question led one group of political scientists to note that it [...] "clearly revealed Goldsmith's Eurosceptic colours" [...] and that the wider pronouncements of the party became increasingly Eurosceptic as time went on.|$|E

Cantrell explained the reunion, [...] "We want to celebrate {{what we did}} {{and the memory of}} our friend. We have played with some [...] who can actually bring it and add their own thing to it without being a Layne clone. We're not interested in stepping on [...] rich legacy. It's a tough thing to go through. Do you take the Led Zeppelin approach and never play again, because the guy was that important? That's the approach we've taken for a lot of years. <b>Or,</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> give it a shot, try something? We're willing {{to take a chance on}} it. It's completely a reunion because the three of us who're left are back together. But it's not about separating and forgetting — it's about remembering and moving on." [...] Before the tour, Kinney mentioned in an interview that he would be interested in writing new material, but not as Alice in Chains.|$|E

500|$|On February 18, the seven-man rescue party scaled Frémont Pass (now Donner Pass); as {{they neared}} where Eddy told them the cabins would be, they began to shout. Mrs. Murphy {{appeared}} from {{a hole in the}} snow, stared at them and asked, [...] "Are you men from California, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> come from heaven?" [...] The relief party doled out food in small portions, concerned that it might kill them if the emaciated immigrants overate. All the cabins were buried in snow. Sodden oxhide roofs had begun to rot and the smell was overpowering. Thirteen people at the camps were dead, and their bodies had been loosely buried in snow near the cabin roofs. Some of the emigrants seemed emotionally unstable. Three of the rescue party trekked to the Donners and brought back four gaunt children and three adults. Leanna Donner had particular difficulty walking up the steep incline from Alder Creek to Truckee Lake, later writing [...] "such pain and misery as I endured that day is beyond description." [...] George Donner's arm was so gangrenous that he could not move. Twenty-three people were chosen to go with the rescue party, leaving twenty-one in the cabins at Truckee Lake and twelve at Alder Creek.|$|E
500|$|Beginning {{with the}} periodical's 30th issue in 1979, Greenwood {{published}} {{a series of}} short articles that detailed the setting in The Dragon magazine, {{the first of which}} was about a monster known as the curst. Greenwood wrote voluminous entries to Dragon magazine, using the Realms as a setting for his descriptions of magic items, monsters, and spells. In 1986, the American game publishing company TSR began looking for a new campaign setting for the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game, and assigned Jeff Grubb {{to find out more about}} the setting used by Greenwood as portrayed in his articles in Dragon. According to Greenwood, Grubb asked him [...] "Do you just make this stuff up as you go, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> really have a huge campaign world?"; Greenwood answered [...] "yes" [...] to both questions. TSR felt that the Forgotten Realms would be a more open-ended setting than the epic Dragonlance setting, and chose the Realms as a ready-made campaign setting upon deciding to publish AD 2nd Edition. Greenwood agreed to work on the project, and began working to get the Forgotten Realms officially published. Greenwood sent TSR a few dozen cardboard boxes stuffed with pencil notes and maps, and sold all rights to the Realms for a token fee. Greenwood noted that TSR altered his original conception of the Realms being a place that we could travel to from our world, [...] "Concerns over possible lawsuits (kids getting hurt while trying to 'find a gate') led TSR to de-emphasize this meaning".|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, Scott {{said that}} he was filming Prometheus with both adult-oriented R and more {{accessible}} PG-13 film ratings in mind, allowing the more adult content to be cut if necessary without harming the overall presentation. Scott said he had a responsibility to 20th Century Fox to be able to present a PG-13 cut of the film if the studio demanded, allowing it to be viewed by a wider potential audience. When asked about the rating, Scott said, [...] "the question is, do you go for the PG-13, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> go for what it should be, which is R? Financially it makes quite a difference... essentially it's kinda R... it's not just about blood, it's about ideas that are very stressful." [...] Scott also said that, regardless of rating, he would present the most aggressive cut of the film he could, while Rothman said that Scott would not be forced to compromise the film's quality to avoid an R-rating. On May 7, 2012, Fox confirmed that the film had received an R-rating and would be released without any cuts being made. According to Scott, the scene of Shaw surgically removing her alien offspring was the significant cause of the restrictive rating, and it was suggested that removing the scene entirely would {{be the only way to}} gain a lower one. A fight scene between Shaw and the Engineer was shortened because Scott decided that Shaw directly wounding the Engineer diminished his role. Scott concluded work on the film in March 2012.|$|E

2500|$|When {{constitutional}} amendments were being {{considered in the}} 1960s, {{the role of the}} monarchy was not strenuously questioned, as it was deemed to be [...] "no great priority in the present round of constitutional changes." [...] This statement was reflected in the four opinion polls conducted in 1970, which showed that the monarchy was favoured by two thirds of those questioned. The Canadian Institute of Public Opinion asked nationally: [...] "Do you think Canada should continue to pay allegiance to The Queen, <b>or</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think we should become a republic with an elected president?" [...] To this, 50% opted for retention of the status quo, 33% favoured a republic, and the remainder declined to answer. Further, the answers differed by region: in Quebec, 46% wished for a republic as against 23% for monarchy, while in Ontario the monarchy was favoured well above the national average, and support was even higher in the western provinces. Older persons (over 50 years) were the strongest advocates for the monarchy than any other age group, although those in their 20s also gave their preference for the Crown. Similarly, another poll that year revealed that in Canada, exclusive of Quebec, the monarchy was of no issue to 37% of the populace, and a further 41% rated themselves as loyalists, although many of the older responders [...] "recognised that youth had different ideas which might have an effect in the future." ...|$|E
