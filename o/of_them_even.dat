Yttrium is so close in size to the so-called 'yttrium group' of heavy lanthanide ions that in solution, it behaves {{as if it were}} one <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> <b>Even</b> though the lanthanides are one row farther down the periodic table than yttrium, the similarity in atomic radius may be attributed to the lanthanide contraction.|$|E

5|$|The {{continuing}} {{failure to}} advance in Italy prompted the Combined Chiefs of Staff to postpone Operation Anvil, the on-again-off-again proposal for Allied landings {{along the coast}} of southern France coinciding with Overlord. Clark told Devers that another attack on the Gustav Line could not be mounted until May, and VI Corps could not be withdrawn from Anzio until it succeeded. But planning for Anvil, begun in mid-January by AFHQ's Force 163 in Algiers continued. Initially Clark was to lead the assault, with Lucas taking over Fifth Army. Devers did not have much faith in either <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>even</b> before Lucas' relief. Lyman Lemnitzer later recalled that Fifth Army staff feared that Devers would relieve Clark every time the two met.|$|E
