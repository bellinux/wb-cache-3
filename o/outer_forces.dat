The conception of the relationship of the different parts and members of the vast cosmos was not accessible to Byron, as it is to a later generation, but his constant appeal in season and out of season to all the life and movement that surrounds man, implied and promoted the widest extension of consciousness of the wholeness and community of natural processes.|$|E

In the first problem distribution of velocities and pressures in the layer between the cylinder and the chamber is determined analytically. Stability criteria of a rotating cylinder (a rotor) motion subject to problem parameters are studied. Then the problem of motion of a horizontal rotating rigid unstable cylinder in a stationary circular cylindrical chamber, which has finite length and is filled with viscous gas is solved. The inner cylinder is influenced by <b>outer</b> <b>forces</b> which vary periodically in time. Trajectories of the rotor stationary motion for various velocities of rotation, disbalance values, amplitudes and frequencies of <b>outer</b> <b>forces</b> are calculated.

Cross-linking was employed by 1 -ethyl- 3 - 3 -dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide (EDC) agent.
