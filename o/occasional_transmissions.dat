In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of an adenovirus (AdV) -based multivalent vaccine approach for pandemic preparedness against H 5, H 7 and H 9 avian influenza viruses in a mouse model. Replication-defective AdV vectors expressing hemagglutinin (HA) from different subtypes and nucleoprotein (NP) from one subtype induced high levels of humoral and cellular immune responses and conferred protection against virus replication following challenge with H 5, H 7 and H 9 avian influenza virus subtypes. Inclusion of HA from the 2009 H 1 N 1 pandemic virus in the vaccine formulation further broadened the vaccine coverage.

Probable human-to-human transmission {{has been documented}} rarely, but H 5 N 1 viruses have not yet acquired the ability to transmit efficiently among humans, an essential property of a pandemic virus. The pandemics of 1957 and 1968 were caused by avian–human reassortant influenza viruses that had acquired human virus-like receptor binding properties. However, the relative contribution of human internal protein genes or other molecular changes to the efficient transmission of influenza viruses among humans remains poorly understood. Here, we report on a comparative ferret model that parallels the efficient transmission of H 3 N 2 human viruses and the poor transmission of H 5 N 1 avian viruses in humans. In this model, an H 3 N 2 reassortant virus with avian virus internal protein genes exhibited efficient replication but inefficient transmission, whereas H 5 N 1 reassortant viruses with four or six human virus internal protein genes exhibited reduced replication and no transmission. These findings indicate that the human virus H 3 N 2 surface protein genes alone did not confer efficient transmissibility and that acquisition of human virus internal protein genes alone was insufficient for this 1997 H 5 N 1 virus to develop pandemic capabilities, even after serial passages in a mammalian host.

40|$|An {{increase}} in norovirus outbreaks was reported internationally during 2002 and 2003 {{and was also}} observed in Oxfordshire (United Kingdom) hospitals. To understand their epidemiological relationships, viruses from 22 outbreaks (15 from one hospital) were subjected to nucleotide sequencing. The 3 ′-terminal 3, 255 nt or complete genomes were determined for 49 viruses. All outbreaks were caused by a genogroup II norovirus related to the Lordsdale virus (GII 4), common in healthcare settings. The norovirus mutation rate was sufficiently high that the 3, 255 -nucleotide sequences allowed separate and potentially connected outbreaks to be identified, since all outbreaks with identical sequences were temporally or geographically linked. The high mutation rate was further indicated by four mutations and three microheterogeneities in 3, 255 nucleotides during 17 days of norovirus shedding by an immunocompromised patient. The data suggested that multiple virus introductions from the community, <b>occasional</b> <b>transmission</b> among wards, and one instance of ongoing environmental contamination had occurred. The accumulation, or lack, of mutations within an outbreak was also used to indicate the predominant transmission route.

This norovirus epidemic strain differed from its closest previously described relative by 11. 4 to 13. 6 % in the outer P 2 domain of the capsid, which also had a single-amino-acid insertion.

In 2009, pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 infection in a domestic cat from Iowa was diagnosed by a novel PCR assay that distinguishes between Eurasian and North American pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009 virus matrix genes. Human-to-cat transmission is presumed. Influenza viruses are typically host specific; aquatic birds {{are considered the}} primary reservoir. However, interspecies transmission does occur (1 – 9) and occasionally leads to novel host-adapted strains. Interspecies transmission of influenza virus has been a public health concern because of the possibility that, through reassortment, a novel strain with zoonotic potential could emerge. The recent infection of dogs with equine influenza virus (H 3 N 8) (2) and of swine with human influenza virus (H 1 N 2) (4) are particularly intriguing because the former resulted in influenza becoming endemic in dogs and the latter resulted in a documented reassortment event between human and swine influenza viruses. Such concern has escalated with the recent emergence of the novel quadruple-reassorted influenza virus (H 1 N 1) [pandemic (H 1 N 1) 2009] in humans (10).

Two previous pandemics of 1957 and 1968 resulted from the reassortment of low pathogenic avian viruses and human subtypes of that period; however, conditions leading to a pandemic virus are still poorly understood. Given the endemic situation of avian H 9 N 2 influenza with human-like receptor specificity in Eurasia and its <b>occasional</b> <b>transmission</b> to humans and pigs, we wanted to determine whether an avian–human H 9 N 2 reassortant could gain respiratory transmission in a mammalian animal model, the ferret. Here we show that following adaptation in the ferret, a reassortant virus carrying the surface proteins of an avian H 9 N 2 in a human H 3 N 2 backbone can transmit efficiently via respiratory droplets, creating a clinical infection similar to human influenza infections. Minimal changes at the protein level were found in this virus capable of respiratory droplet transmission. A reassortant virus expressing only the HA and neuraminidase (NA) of the ferret-adapted virus was able {{to account for the}} transmissibility, suggesting that currently circulating avian H 9 N 2 viruses require little adaptation in mammals following acquisition of all human virus internal genes through reassortment.

However, {{little is known about}} the genetic co-variation of viruses and different populations of the same bat species, although such information is needed for an understanding of virus transmission dynamics within a given host species. We hypothesized that if virus transmission between host populations depends on events linked to gene flow in the bats, genetic co-variation should exist between host populations and astroviruses. Results We used 19 nuclear and one mitochondrial microsatellite loci to analyze the genetic population structure of the Natterer 2 ̆ 019 s bat (Myotis nattereri) within and among populations at different geographical scales in Germany. Further, we correlated the observed bat population structure to that of partial astrovirus sequences (3232 ̆ 0133940 nt fragments of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene) obtained from the same bat populations. Our analyses revealed that the studied bat colonies can be grouped into three distinct genetic clusters, corresponding to the three geographic regions sampled. Furthermore, we observed an overall isolation-by-distance pattern, while no significant pattern was observed within a geographic region. Moreover, we found no correlation between the genetic distances among the bat populations and the astrovirus sequences they harbored. Even though high genetic similarity of some of the astrovirus haplotypes found in several different regions was detected, identical astrovirus haplotypes were not shared between different sampled regions. Conclusions The genetic population structure of the bat host suggests that mating sites where several local breeding colonies meet act as stepping-stones for gene flow. Identical astrovirus haplotypes were not shared between different sampled regions suggesting that astroviruses are mostly transmitted among host colonies at the local scale. Nevertheless, high genetic similarity of some of the astrovirus haplotypes found in several different regions implies that <b>occasional</b> <b>transmission</b> across regions with subsequent mutations of the virus haplotypes does occur...|$|R

Results: We found {{a high level of}} genetic diversity for Wolbachia, with 36 unique strains detected (64 investigated mite individuals). Sequence data from four Wolbachia genes suggest that new alleles are 7. 5 to 11 {{times more likely to be}} generated by recombination than point mutation. Consistent with previous reports on more diverse host samples, our data did not reveal evidence for co-evolution of Wolbachia with its host. Cardinium was less frequently found in the mites, but also showed a high level of diversity, with eight unique strains detected in 15 individuals on the basis of only two genes. A lack of congruence among host and Cardinium phylogenies wa...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Singapore {{has been}} {{certified}} malaria free since November 1982 by the World Health Organization and despite <b>occasional</b> local <b>transmission,</b> {{the country has}} maintained the standing. In 2009, three clusters of malaria cases were reported in Singapore. Methods Epidemiological, entomological and molecular {{studies were carried out}} to investigate the three clusters, namely Mandai-Sungei Kadut, Jurong Island and Sembawang. Results A total of 29 malaria patients, with no recent travel history, were reported in the three clusters. Molecular analysis based on the msp 3 α and msp 1 genes showed two independent local transmissions: one in Mandai-Sungei Kadut and another in Sembawang. Almost all cases within each cluster were epidemiologically linked. In Jurong Island cluster, epidemiological link remains uncertain, as almost all cases had a unique genetic profile. Only two cases shared a common profile and were found to be linked to the Mandai-Sungei Kadut cluster. Entomological investigation found Anopheles sinensis to be the predominant Anopheline in the two areas where local transmission of P. vivax was confirmed. Anopheles sinensis was found to be attracted to human bait and bites as early as 19 : 45 hrs. However, all Anopheles mosquitoes caught were negative for sporozoites and oocysts by dissection. Conclusion Investigation of P. vivax cases from the three cluster areas confirmed the occurrence of local transmission in two areas. Although An. sinensis was the predominant Anopheline found in areas with confirmed transmission, the vector/s responsible for the outbreaks still remains cryptic. </p...|$|R
40|$|On 31 March 2013, Chinese {{authorities}} {{announced the}} identification of a novel reassortant A(H 7 N 9) influenza virus isolated from three unlinked fatal cases of severe respiratory disease in eastern China; two in Shanghai and one in Anhui province. The WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) had subtyped and sequenced the viruses; they {{were found to be}} almost identical and considered to be of low-pathogenic avian origin. This {{is the first time that}} human infection with avian influenza virus A(H 7 N 9) has been identified. This is also the first time that a low-pathogenic avian virus caused lethal human infections. Since then, human cases have continued to be reported, and as of 1 May, there were 128 laboratory-confirmed cases, including 26 deaths reported from eight neighbouring provinces (Anhui, Fujian, Henan, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong, and Zhejiang) and two municipalities (Beijing and Shanghai). One case who acquired his infection in Jiangsu travelled to Taiwan before developing illness. A few small clusters were detected but almost all cases have occurred sporadically, without obvious epidemiological links. While <b>occasional</b> human-to-human <b>transmission</b> in the clusters cannot be ruled out, there is certainly no confirmed sustained human-to-human transmission. A few mild cases have been detected. Outside the clusters, more than 3000 contacts of the cases were traced, which did not lead to the detection o...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative data on {{modes of}} {{transmission}} are a crucial element {{in understanding the}} ecology of microorganisms associated with animals. We investigated the transmission patterns of a -proteobacterium informally known as pea aphid Bemisia-like symbiont (PABS), also known as T-type, which is widely but not universally distributed in natural populations of the pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum. The vertical transmission of PABS to asexual and sexual morphs and sexually produced eggs was demonstrated by a diagnostic PCR-based assay, and the maximum estimated failure rate was 2 %. Aphids naturally lacking PABS acquired PABS bacteria administered via the diet, and the infection persisted by vertical transmission {{for at least three}} aphid generations. PABS was also detected in two of five aphid honeydew samples tested and in all five siphuncular fluid samples tested but in none of 15 samples of salivary secretions from PABS-positive aphids. However, PABSnegative aphids did not acquire PABS when they were cocultured with PABS-positive aphids; the maximal estimated level of horizontal transmission was 18 %. A deterministic model indicated that the force of infection by a horizontal transmission rate of 3 % is sufficient to maintain a previously described estimate of the prevalence of PABS-positive aphids (37 %), if the vertical transmission rate is 98 %. We concluded that PABS infections in A. pisum can be maintained by high vertical <b>transmission</b> rates and <b>occasional</b> horizontal <b>transmission,</b> possibly via the oral route, in the absence of selection either for or against aphids bearing this bacterium...|$|R
