5|$|The {{footage of}} Don {{returning}} to bed after kicking Andrea {{out of the}} apartment was actually reverse footage of Don getting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> only minutes before, which led some to believe that this was a directorial touch by Shakman to help the viewer discern the dream sequence by including unreal footage.|$|E
5|$|Annis's brother, Sir Geoffrey Wychwood, hears rumours of her {{developing}} {{relationship with}} Carleton and sends {{his wife and}} children to Bath to discourage Carleton. Soon after their arrival members of the household contract influenza, and Annis nurses them until she too becomes infected. When Carleton hears that Annis is seriously ill he returns to Bath, arriving on the first day that she is able to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed.</b> Annis agrees to marry Carleton, despite the objections of her brother.|$|E
5|$|At the Asekoff residence, Bo becomes {{upset and}} begins barking. Mrs. Asekoff lets him outside {{but when she}} {{attempts}} to retrieve him, the dog refuses to budge. She turns to go back inside but discovers {{that it has been}} bolted from the inside. Louis hears his mother's screams and climbs <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> but a dark, shadowy figure with red eyes corners him. Louis barely escapes through the dog door where he runs into Mulder, informing him of the creature's whereabouts in the house.|$|E
50|$|The {{hospital}} {{was placed on}} black alert in November 2007 when it ran <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> for a time. Ambulances were forced to queue outside the building while non-urgent patients were discharged to free up beds and a major incident emergency plan implemented.|$|R

40|$|Rapidly {{emerging}} batteryless sensors {{are creating}} tremendous opportunities for truly wearable sensors for activity recognition. However, data streams from such sensors {{are characterized by}} sparsity and noise, which make activity recognition a challenging task. In this paper, we study the feasibility of passive computational RFID sensors for ambulatory monitoring. In particular, we focus on recognizing transfers <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> or chairs and walking. Ideally, all these activities need to be monitored by movement sensor alarm systems to alert caregivers to provide supervision during the ambulation of older people in hospitals and nursing homes to prevent a fall. Our novel approach to partition continuous sensor data on natural activity boundaries and to identify transfers <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>beds</b> or chairs and walking as transitions between sequences of movements overcomes issues posed by the sparsity and the noise. We demonstrate through in-depth experiments the high performance (F-score > 93 %) and the responsiveness of our approach. Asanga Wickramasinghe, and Damith C. Ranasingh...|$|R
5|$|Berlin's {{civilian}} {{work schedule}} {{had been that}} of a hardworking night owl, generally writing material until two or three in the morning. His efforts to adjust to military life and become a good soldier included springing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> obediently each morning, which earned him the resentment of fellow soldiers because he concealed his hatred of reveille too well and appeared eager {{to wake up in}} the mornings.|$|E
5|$|Activities {{that reduce}} {{physiological}} arousal and cognitive activity promote falling asleep, so engaging in relaxing activities before bedtime is recommended. Conversely, continuing important work activities or planning shortly before bedtime or once in bed {{has been shown}} to delay falling asleep. Similarly, good sleep hygiene involves minimizing time spent thinking about worries or anything emotionally upsetting shortly before bedtime. Trying purposefully to fall asleep may induce frustration that further prevents falling asleep, so in such situations a person may be advised to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> and try something else for a brief amount of time.|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired {{to his home in}} Kensington, west London. His former partner, Mary Austin, had been a particular comfort in his final years, and {{in the last few weeks}} of his life made regular visits to his home to look after him. Near the end of his life Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and he deteriorated to the point where he could not get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed.</b> Due to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take his medication and continued taking only painkillers.|$|E

5|$|It was {{observed}} that immediately after going to bed, generally at about 8:00pm, Domery {{would begin to}} sweat profusely. After one to two hours lying awake and perspiring, he would fall asleep before waking at around 1:00am extremely hungry, regardless {{of what he had}} eaten before going to bed. At this time, he would eat any available food, or if no food was available would smoke tobacco. At around 2:00am he would go back to sleep, and wake again at between 5:00 and 6:00am, sweating heavily; {{as soon as he got}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> the sweating would cease, starting again whenever he ate.|$|E
5|$|Klaus {{tells of}} the Krampus, unnerving Kathy. Before bed, Toby leaves out his boots for the Krampus, and Kathy empties a bottle of tablets. The next morning, Toby's boots are filled with switches, indicating—according to Klaus's story—that he has been visited by the Krampus due to his naughtiness. Celia {{suspects}} Kathy, who is not Toby's mother, but Julian rebukes her. At dinner, Toby {{tells of the}} wonderful day he has had with Klaus. Toby heads to bed, and Kathy speculates that Toby was sleepwalking the night before, becoming agitated when Julian and Celia are unconvinced. That night, both Toby and Celia are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> and {{the figure of the}} Krampus is seen. The next day, scratches are found on Toby's body, and Celia leaves with the child.|$|E
5|$|At midnight, Homer quietly gets <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> visits {{each family}} member, {{who are all}} asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, {{he goes to the}} living room and listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape. The tape plays out to which {{suddenly}} his head drops and it appears he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens the next morning and is panicked that her husband is not by her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, collapsed in the armchair. As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up and drums in {{the fact that he is}} alive and had not been poisoned after all. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows to live life to its fullest. Back to living his normal life, Homer returns to the couch watching a bowling tournament and eating pork rinds.|$|E

5|$|Coming in at 7/173, Meckiff top-scored with 55—his only {{first-class}} 50—as Victoria batted {{first and}} made a late recovery to end with 244. Meckiff took 3/65, including the wickets of Test players Bill Watson and Richie Benaud as New South Wales responded with 281. In the Victorian second innings Meckiff managed only 8 as Victoria left their opponents a target of 161 runs for victory. The paceman took 4/56 and claimed the final wicket, removing Test opener Jim Burke caught for 8 as New South Wales mustered 160, causing the match to end in the first tie in Shield history. Burke had returned to bat after being injured earlier in the innings, while New South Wales captain Ian Craig, who had been ill, hauled himself <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> {{in an attempt to}} salvage the match after his team had fallen to 7/70. Meckiff's other victims in the final innings included Test players Alan Davidson and Johnny Martin.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Kaganovich {{arrived in}} Kiev, Khrushchev fell ill, and was barely seen until September 1947. In his memoirs, Khrushchev {{indicates}} he had pneumonia; some biographers have theorized that Khrushchev's illness was entirely political, {{out of fear}} that his loss of position was the first step towards downfall and demise. However, Khrushchev's children remembered their father as having been seriously ill. Once Khrushchev was able to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed,</b> he and his family took their first vacation since before the war, to a beachfront resort in Latvia. Khrushchev, though, soon broke the beach routine with duck-hunting trips, and a visit to newly Soviet Kaliningrad, where he toured factories and quarries. By the end of 1947, Kaganovich had been recalled to Moscow and the recovered Khrushchev had been restored to the First Secretaryship. He then resigned the Ukrainian premiership in favor of Demyan Korotchenko, Khrushchev's protégé.|$|E
5|$|The Canadiens' team doctor, Dr. J.A. Hector Forgues, visited Morenz in late February and {{determined}} that he had suffered a nervous breakdown. To help Morenz, Dr. Forgues banned all visitors to his room, except for family and Canadiens officials. Mary, Morenz's wife, and their oldest son, Howie Jr., visited on most days, and William Morenz, his father, travelled from Stratford {{during the first week}} of March and stayed through March 5. On March 8, Morenz began complaining of chest pains, which doctors attributed to a heart attack. Mary Morenz and Cecil Hart were called to the hospital; around 11:30pm, Morenz tried to get <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bed</b> to use the washroom but collapsed on the floor and died from a coronary embolism caused by blood clots from his damaged leg, minutes before his wife and coach arrived. He was 34.|$|E
