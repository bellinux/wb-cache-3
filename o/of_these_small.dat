5|$|Over 400 souterrains {{have been}} {{discovered}} in Scotland, {{many of them in}} the south-east, and although few have been dated those that have suggest a construction date in the 2nd or 3rd centuries. Unfortunately the purpose <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> underground structures is also obscure. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.|$|E
5|$|In New Guinea, {{a country}} without roads, {{large-scale}} transportation {{of men and}} materiel {{would have to be}} accomplished by aircraft or ships. A multi-pronged approach was employed to solve this problem. Disassembled landing craft were shipped to Australia, where they were assembled in Cairns. The range <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> landing craft was to be greatly extended by the landing ships of the VII Amphibious Force, which began arriving in late 1942, and formed part of the newly formed Seventh Fleet. Since the Seventh Fleet had no aircraft carriers, the range of naval operations was limited by that of the fighter aircraft of the Fifth Air Force.|$|E
5|$|When the {{initiating}} computer {{sends the}} complete instructions, or job, for processing to the controller, the controller splits the task up into these small instruction packets, known as tasks. The {{design of the}} Xgrid system consists <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> packets being transferred to all the Xgrid-enabled computers on the network. These computers, or nodes, execute the instructions provided by the controller and then return the results. The controller assembles the individual task results into the whole job results and returns them to the initiating computer.|$|E

5|$|With no aid {{possible}} from the shore, night fell on 14January {{with most of the}} crew and passengers still aboard. During the night, the waves stove in (smashed in) the stern of the ship, flooding much of the interior. On the morning of 15January, a small boat carrying nine British prisoners (part of the crew of the Cumberland, captured by Droits de l'Homme earlier in the campaign) managed to reach shore. The sight of the British-manned boat reaching shore prompted a mass launching of small rafts from the wreck in hopes of gaining the beach. However the waves increased once more, and not one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> craft survived the passage.|$|E
5|$|Beetles are {{generally}} {{characterized by a}} particularly hard exoskeleton and hard forewings (elytra) not usable for flying. Almost all beetles have mandibulate mouthparts with the mandibles mobile in a horizontal plane. The mouthparts are rarely suctorial and are sometimes reduced and the maxillae always bear palps. The antennae usually have 11 or fewer segments except in some groups like the Rhipiceridae and Cerambycidae. The coxae of the legs are usually located recessed within a coxal cavity. The genitalic structures are telescoped into the last abdominal segment in all extant beetles. Unlike the adults, beetle larvae can often be confused with larvae of other endopterygote groups. The beetle's exoskeleton {{is made up of}} numerous plates, called sclerites, separated by thin sutures. This design provides armored defenses while maintaining flexibility. The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform, although specific organs and appendages vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order. Like all insects, beetles' bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. Because there are so many species, identification is quite difficult, and relies on attributes including the shape of the antennae, the tarsal formulae and shapes <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> segments on the legs, the mouthparts, and the ventral plates (sterna, pleura, coxae). In many species accurate identification can only be made by examination of the unique male genitalic structures.|$|E
5|$|In late 1942, the Germans {{consolidated}} {{some small}} ghettos in the Vilnius region with Gens' help. These included the ghettos at Oszmiana, Švenčionys, Soly, and Michaliszki. During {{one of these}} consolidations, on 25 October, Gens gave up 400 old people in return for saving the remaining 600 Jewish residents of Oszmiana. He bribed Martin Weiss, commander of the Ponary killing squad, to accept the lower quota. The Jewish police from Vilnius {{as well as some}} Lithuanians were forced to kill the 400 Jews. One ghetto diarist claimed that the Vilnius ghetto was outraged by Gens' participation in the killings, but other diarists stated that most ghetto inhabitants approved of Gens' choice to save some. By April 1943, most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> ghettos were gone, with their inhabitants either moved to labor camps, shot, or moved to the Vilnius Ghetto. On 4–5 April, the last inhabitants were loaded into trains {{under the supervision of the}} Vilnius Jewish police, and the police accompanied the trains, which passed through Vilnius on their way to Ponary. Gens joined his policemen when the train went through Vilnius, and was arrested along with them when the train arrived at Ponary. Gens and the policemen were released, but the other Jews on the train were executed. It appears that the Germans misled Gens about the destination of the trains. Gens justified the participation of the Vilnius ghetto police in these roundups by claiming that their participation saved at least some of the ghetto residents, when otherwise the Germans would have shot them all.|$|E

25|$|One {{particular}} species <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> and undemanding danionines is the zebrafish (Danio rerio). It {{has become}} the standard model species for studying developmental genetics of vertebrates, in particular fish.|$|E
25|$|The Eurasian teal or {{common teal}} (Anas crecca) {{is a common}} and {{widespread}} duck which breeds in temperate Eurasia and migrates south in winter. The Eurasian teal is often called simply the teal due to being the only one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> dabbling ducks in much of its range. The bird gives {{its name to the}} blue-green colour teal.|$|E

50|$|Carson High offers eight small {{learning}} communities (SLCs) to its students. It {{is a school}} within a school. It is mandatory that each student be enrolled in one <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>smaller</b> education communities. Each SLC had its own building on campus.|$|R
25|$|Since 1974, {{the party}} system in Belize has been {{dominated}} by the centre-left People's United Party and the centre-right United Democratic Party, although there have been other small parties that have participated at all levels of elections in the past. Though none <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> political parties have ever won any significant number of seats and/or offices, their challenge has been growing over the years.|$|E
25|$|The {{size and}} {{building}} refinement vary noticeably among the tumuli, indicating the social ranks of their occupiers. The particularity of some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> tumuli are the stones that crown them, which are of different colours and texture than the surrounding volcanic material. The most common ones are a simple ring of volcanic stones, {{the more sophisticated}} ones are topped with turret-type stonework and were probably used to bury nobility.|$|E
25|$|The {{fishing was}} {{actually}} carried out in small boats, carrying {{only two or three}} fishermen. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> boats would be lost in the fog and never returned to the ship. As technology evolved, the three-mast boats disappeared, giving way to steamers, then to diesel-engined vessels. These days, only a small fishing fleet survives, restricted to fishing around coastal waters. In the harbour, pleasure-boats have taken the place of all but a few fishing-boats.|$|E
5|$|Smaller islands, tidal islets only {{separated}} {{at higher}} {{stages of the}} tide, and skerries that are only exposed at lower stages of the tide pepper the North Atlantic surrounding the main islands. This is a continuing list <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>smaller</b> Outer Hebridean islands.|$|R
50|$|Danish {{electricity}} generation {{has become increasingly}} decentralised with a move away from production in the large central power stations to many smaller, locally based and mostly CHP stations. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>smaller</b> stations use locally sourced bio energy sources including straw and wood pellets.|$|R
50|$|Both WA Knell and Adolphus {{painted a}} {{significant}} number of small picture of boats at dusk and in the moonlight. Many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>smaller</b> pictures are on panel rather than on canvas which has the advantage that the harder surface allows for higher detail.|$|R
25|$|The city is drained {{by three}} rivers; the West, Mill, and Quinnipiac, named in order from west to east. The West River {{discharges}} into West Haven Harbor, while the Mill and Quinnipiac rivers discharge into New Haven Harbor. Both harbors are embayments of Long Island Sound. In addition, several smaller streams {{flow through the}} city's neighborhoods, including Wintergreen Brook, the Beaver Ponds Outlet, Wilmot Brook, Belden Brook, and Prospect Creek. Not all <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> streams have continuous flow year-round.|$|E
25|$|Along {{the coast}} {{just south of}} Cape Arago are several parks that were {{formerly}} the location of early homesteaders, {{as well as the}} former Seven Devil's Trail. The homesteaders eventually abandoned their claims in favor of living closer to the nearby rural villages and towns. Today, nothing remains <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> farms and ranches, though several state parks mark their locations. However, south at Cape Blanco sits the Patrick Hughes House. The Hughes House is now a part of Cape Blanco State Park.|$|E
25|$|Vitrectomy may be {{successful}} in treating more severe cases. The technique usually involves making three openings through {{the part of the}} sclera known as the pars plana. <b>Of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> gauge instruments, one is an infusion port to resupply a saline solution and maintain the pressure of the eye, the second is a fiber optic light source, and the third is a vitrector. The vitrector has a reciprocating cutting tip attached to a suction device. This design reduces traction on the retina via the vitreous material. A variant sutureless, self-sealing technique is sometimes used.|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} between the styles <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>smaller</b> compositions and his larger, religious works {{has yet to be}} satisfactorily explained. Some historians have suggested that possibly the smaller works are the work of a family member such as a son or brother of Pepijn.|$|R
50|$|CTV O&Os {{in smaller}} markets air a {{newscast}} produced {{in one of}} the larger markets noted above, although some may also produce a shorter local news insert aired during a break in the main market's program, and some <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>smaller</b> stations produce their own noon newscasts.|$|R
5000|$|The family {{contains}} {{relatively large}} numbers of small objects. Since most <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>smaller</b> objects are [...] "eroded" [...] away over time due to secondary collisions, gravitational perturbations, and the Yarkovsky effect, this indicates that the Eunomia family was created relatively recently (on an astronomical timescale).|$|R
25|$|During {{experiments}} in 1907, Ettore Bellini and Alessandro Tosi noticed {{that they could}} cause the received signal to be re-radiated by forming a loop with multiple winds of wire. Using two loop antennae arranged at right angles and two sets <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> wire coils arranged the same way, the directional properties of the original radio signal were re-created. Direction finding could then be carried out with a conventional loop antenna placed {{in the center of}} these two stators (or field coils); the rotating loop was known as the rotor (or sense coil).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the Daimler double decker buses in operation by the Melbourne Motor Omnibus Co, many of Melbourne's private bus operators began by running jitney-style seven-seat buses. The use <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> buses {{may have been an}} attempt to circumvent State government road regulations. While some of the early operators ran fixed routes with regular timetables, there was no State Government agency to regulate the routes, or officially recognise them. A number of companies competed with trams, running along tram routes but charging lower fares. The Motor Omnibus Act of 1924 disallowed bus competition along tramway routes.|$|E
25|$|César de Hauke’s {{catalogue}} raisonné of {{the works}} of Seurat lists fourteen works as oil studies for the Bathers, most if not all of which were almost certainly painted outdoors, and in which the composition of the final piece may be seen gradually taking shape. The last of these studies—presently housed at the Art Institute of Chicago—was painted in 1883 and is very close to the final work, except most obviously in respect of its size; it is just 25cm long and 16cm high. Seurat was fond <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>small</b> studies, calling them his croquetons (a nonce word best translated as ‘sketchettes’), and hanging them on the walls of his studio.|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>smaller</b> Turtle Islands was Mooniyaa, where Mooniyaang now stands.

25|$|Nearly {{all of its}} planned {{openings}} through 2019 {{are small}} formats, which is less than 50,000 square feet. The goal <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>smaller</b> format stores is {{to win over the}} business of millennial customers. The nearly 30 new locations will be situated in college towns or densely populated areas.|$|R
50|$|Because of its later development, Oakridge {{is perhaps}} the least {{historic}} part of Vancouver. It was dominated by bungalow homes constructed in the 1950s and 1960s, however in the last 10 years many <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>smaller</b> houses have been torn down, and {{have been replaced by}} larger multi-level residences.|$|R
