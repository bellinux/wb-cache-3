2500|$|The Nord Stream <b>offshore</b> <b>pipeline</b> is {{operated}} by the special purpose company—Nord Stream AG. Nord Stream AG was incorporated in Zug, Switzerland on 30 November 2005. Shareholders of the company are the Russian gas company Gazprom (51% of shares), German gas companies Wintershall and E.ON Ruhrgas (both 15.5%), the Dutch gas company Gasunie (9%), and the French gas company GDF Suez (9%). [...] The Managing Director of Nord Stream AG is Matthias Warnig {{and the chairman of}} the shareholders' committee is German ex-chancellor Gerhard Schröder.|$|E
2500|$|Russian and German {{officials}} {{have claimed that}} the pipeline leads to economic savings due to the elimination of transit fees (as transit countries would be bypassed), and a higher operating pressure of the <b>offshore</b> <b>pipeline</b> which leads to lower operating costs (by eliminating the necessity for expensive midway compressor stations). [...] According to Ukrtransgaz, the Ukrainian gas transportation system operator, Ukraine alone will lose natural gas transit revenues up to $720million per year. [...] Gazprom has stated that it will divert 20billion m3 of natural gas transported through Ukraine to Nord Stream.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, the {{exploitation}} of hydrocarbons reserves in deep seas and oceans, {{in combination with the}} need to transport hydrocarbons among countries, has made the design, construction and operation of <b>offshore</b> <b>pipelines</b> very significant. Under this perspective, it is evident that many more <b>offshore</b> <b>pipelines</b> are expected to be constructed in the near future and in particular in the wider Mediterranean region. Given the fact that <b>offshore</b> <b>pipelines</b> are crossing extended areas, they may face a variety of geo-hazards that cause substantial permanent ground deformations and potentially threaten the integrity of the pipeline. The present study focuses on the impact of permanent ground deformations induced by active seismic faults on <b>offshore</b> <b>pipelines.</b> For this purpose, a numerical simulation (through finite-element modeling and strain-based criteria) is made, in order to study the distress of <b>offshore</b> <b>pipelines</b> subjected to PGDs induced by active normal and reverse seismic faults at the seabed. Factors, such as the geometrical properties of the fault, the mechanical properties of the ruptured soil formations, and the pipeline characteristics, are examined. Beginning with an extended introduction to the subject, by presenting some general aspects of <b>offshore</b> <b>pipelines</b> and marine geo-hazards, the problem under investigation and the motivation of the study are explained. Subsequently the geo-hazard of seismic faults is further analyzed as well as the special seismic characteristics of the Mediterranean region. After a literature review on similar researches, a validation of the numerical model, developed in the present study, is performed, through the comparison of the numerical results with the analytical predictions of another study. Having validated the numerical model, a range of critical parameters is examined and their impact on the pipeline is presented. After some interesting conclusions regarding the seismic vulnerability of <b>offshore</b> <b>pipelines,</b> potential cost-effective mitigation measures are proposed taking into account constructability issues...|$|R

2500|$|On April 17, 2010, a new bust {{depicting}} Jacob Riis {{was installed}} at the Central Mall. On July 21, 2011, Staten Island Congressman Michael G. Grimm introduced H.R. 2606 – New York City Natural Gas Supply Enhancement Act – to the U.S. Congress. The bill proposed to construct a [...] natural gas pipeline called the Rockaway Delivery Lateral Project, proposed by Williams Companies, connecting to an existing <b>offshore</b> <b>pipeline</b> and running south-to-north through the sites of Jacob Riis Park and Floyd Bennett Field. The pipeline would run through the golf course of Riis Park, then connect to a new [...] along Flatbush Avenue to be constructed by National Grid. The project {{was supported by the}} district manager of Queens Community Board 14. Grimm, meanwhile, was found to have received campaign money from both Williams and National Grid. Two Queens congressman also supported the pipeline, as did Anthony Weiner before his resignation. The pipeline was opposed by local environmental groups, who felt it would disturb a nearby artificial reef.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 January 2007, the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Finland made a {{statement}} on the environmental impact assessment programme of the Russia-Germany natural gas pipeline, in which it mentioned that alternative routes via the Baltic states, Kaliningrad and/or Poland might theoretically be shorter than the route across the Baltic Sea, {{would be easier to}} flexibly increase the capacity of the pipeline, and might have better financial results. [...] There were also calls from Sweden to consider rerouting the pipeline onto dry land. Poland had proposed the construction of a second line of the Yamal–Europe pipeline, as well as the Amber pipeline through the Baltic states and Poland as land-based alternatives to the <b>offshore</b> <b>pipeline.</b> [...] The Amber project foresees laying a natural gas pipeline across the Tver, Novgorod and Pskov oblasts in Russia and then through Latvia and Lithuania to Poland, where it would be re-connected to the Yamal–Europe pipeline. [...] Latvia has proposed using its underground gas storage facilities if the onshore route were to be used. [...] Proponents have claimed that the Amber pipeline would cost half as much as an underwater pipeline, would be shorter, and would have less environmental impact. [...] Critics of this proposal say that in this case it would be more expensive for the suppliers over the long-term perspective, because the main aim of the project is to reduce transit costs. [...] Nord Stream AG has responded that the Baltic Sea would be the only route for the pipeline and it will not consider an overland alternative.|$|E

50|$|In the US, onshore and <b>offshore</b> <b>pipelines</b> used to {{transport}} {{oil and gas}} are regulated by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). Certain <b>offshore</b> <b>pipelines</b> used to produce oil and gas are regulated by the Minerals Management Service (MMS). In Canada, pipelines are regulated by either the provincial regulators or, if they cross provincial boundaries or the Canada-US border, by the National Energy Board (NEB). Government regulations in Canada and the United States require that buried fuel pipelines must be protected from corrosion. Often, the most economical method of corrosion control is by use of pipeline coating in conjunction with cathodic protection and technology to monitor the pipeline. Above ground, cathodic protection is not an option. The coating is the only external protection.|$|R

40|$|Submarine {{landslides}} {{are one of}} {{the major}} hazards for <b>offshore</b> <b>pipelines.</b> Progressive differential ground movements caused by earthquakes can initiate runout/debris flows that can impact and damage the pipelines. Hence it is important to assess both the stability of submarine slopes due to earthquakes and also the potential runout distances. This is particularly important for deep water pipelines whose routes often cross areas that are prone to landslide and debris flow. This paper presents an overview of slope stability and runout assessment for the <b>offshore</b> <b>pipelines</b> using both analytical and numerical methods. Analytical slope stability assessment is based on guidelines for seismic design and assessment of natural gas and liquid hydrocarbon pipelines, while SLOPE/W and QUAKE/W are used for the numerical assessments. The paper provides a state-of-the art review of runout assessments in literature and summarizes the best methodology through a case study...|$|R

30|$|Therefore, several {{methods are}} {{employed}} by petroleum industries to transport crude oils through pipelines, dilution/blending of crude with lighter oil or organic solvents, preheating of crude and subsequent heating of pipelines, use of pour point depressants (PPDs), application of drag reducing additives {{and development of}} core annular flow (CAF) and in situ oil upgrading (Martínez-Palou et al. 2011). However, each of these methods has economic, technical and logistical drawbacks {{when it comes to}} transportation of heavy crude oil through <b>offshore</b> <b>pipelines.</b> Another pipeline technique favourable for cold offshore environments is the transportation of heavy crudes as oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} part of an ongoing {{research}} program between SIMLab and Statoil about impact loads on X 65 <b>offshore</b> <b>pipelines</b> and it is a continuation of previous work. <b>Offshore</b> <b>pipelines</b> are frequently impacted by accidental loads, e. g. trawl gear or anchors. Such loads may cause severe damage to the pipe and a complex stress-strain history locally in the impacted area. Fracture have previously been found in pipes dynamically impacted. Quasi-static bending of similar pipes with the same boundary conditions have been conducted as part of this thesis. The pipes were examined by metallurgical investigation afterwards, but no sign of fracture was found. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) of the experiments has been carried out to investigate if it is possible to determine fracture by using the Cockcroft-Latham fracture criterion. To carry out analyses on a highly refined mesh, it has been investigated if it is possible to utilize a technique known as submodeling. The analyses did not succeed in predicting fracture. <b>Offshore</b> <b>pipelines</b> are often pressurized and this influences the stress-strain history when impacted. As a continuation of previous work it has been conducted quasi-static bending of pressurized and axially loaded pipes. The internal pressure reduced the amount of denting in the impacted zone and increased the stiffness of the pipe with respect to transverse loading. FEA of the experiments has been conducted to investigate if it is possible to recreate the application of internal pressure and horizontal loading. The force-response and deformation of the pipe was found to be described quite well. Horizontal loading had minor importance on the plastic deformation locally in the impacted zone. <b>Offshore</b> <b>pipelines</b> are often pressurized and this influences the stress-strain history when impacted.
