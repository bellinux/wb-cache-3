25|$|Julia is the {{catalyst}} of the play. While {{the other characters}} either hide their emotions in alcohol or avoid confrontations by smothering their feelings in banal social sweet talk, Julia brings matters to the forefront. She has wants, and she demands that they be at least heard, if not satisfied. The most obvious thing that she wants in this play is her bedroom in her parent’s home. However, upon her return, she discovers that her room is being occupied by Edna and Harry, her parents’ so-called best friends. In her attempts to regain control <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom,</b> Julia makes everyone confront {{the issues of the}} play, namely, defining relationships, wants, needs, and rights. At one point, Julia forces the issue first by having an emotional tantrum, then by upsetting the furniture and all the clothes in her bedroom, and finally by threatening everyone with a gun.|$|E

500|$|The video {{opens with}} Odd Future's R crooner Frank Ocean {{in bed with}} the unnamed [...] "she" [...] of the video, and the singer stops when he sees a masked Tyler staring outside <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> window.

60|$|She {{went into}} <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> and opened <b>her</b> valise. With {{the scent of}} {{lavender}} that came from it, there sprang up a vision <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white <b>bedroom</b> at home, and the trees of the green garden and the blackbirds on the grass.|$|R

500|$|At {{the age of}} 15, Collings fell in {{love with}} Dudley Beaumont, a British painter who could neither shoot nor climb cliffs and whom her father thus {{considered}} a [...] "weakling". In 1901, her father {{made it clear that he}} was adamantly opposed to the relationship. When she continued seeing Beaumont, he dragged her out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> at midnight and threw her out of the seigneurial residence barefoot and in a nightgown. Collings remained in a hedge until Beaumont, alerted by her mother, found her predawn. She boarded a boat for the neighbouring island of Guernsey. When the Seigneur stormed aboard looking for her, she was hidden by the captain. She then travelled to the house of a relative in London. Beaumont soon married her at St James's Church, Piccadilly.|$|E
500|$|He {{heads to}} her house, which is eerily quiet. Going in, he discovers {{a bottle of}} whiskey, several {{cigarette}} butts, and a telegram from the government. Dorothy's husband is dead, his plane shot down over France. Dorothy comes out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom,</b> crying, and Hermie tells her [...] "I'm sorry." [...] The sense of empathy triggers her to channel to Hermie some of her loneliness. She turns on the record player and invites Hermie to dance with her. They kiss and embrace, tears on both their faces. Without speaking, and to the sound only of the waves, they move to the bedroom, where she draws him into bed and gently makes love with him. Afterward, withdrawing again into her world of hurt, Dorothy retires to the porch, leaving Hermie alone in her bedroom. He approaches her on the porch, where she can only quietly say [...] "Good night, Hermie." [...] He leaves, his last image of Dorothy being of her leaning against the railing, as she smokes a cigarette and stares into the night sky.|$|E
500|$|Tracey Ross was {{originally}} hesitant {{to audition for}} another soap opera after her stint as Diana Douglas on Ryan's Hope from 1985 to 1987, which she compared to [...] "working in a morgue" [...] because the show was constantly threatened with cancellation. She initially rejected the offer to play Eve Russell, but she was repeatedly contacted by NBC about the role over several months before her agent convinced her to audition for Passions casting director Jackie Briskey. Ross said later {{that she did not}} realize that Passions was supposed to be [...] "wacky" [...] until the character Grace Bennett floated out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> window. Based on the first week's scripts, she described Passions as [...] "my kind of show" [...] owing to the supernatural and fantasy elements. Ross played the role from the series debut on July 5, 1999 to its finale on August 7, 2008. In 2003, actresses Amanda Maiden and Kimberly Kevon Williams played the character in flashbacks to her childhood and her time as a nightclub singer. Ross described Passions as the opposite of Ryan's Hope; Passions, she felt, was [...] "the spring of a soap opera" [...] because of the cast and crew's excitement about future storylines, while Ryan's Hope was [...] "the winter of one" [...] due to the fear of cancellation.|$|E

50|$|After the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, she {{was trapped}} in one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedrooms</b> for several hours. However, when she got out, she told the {{construction}} crews to stop working on the nearly-completed front {{part of the house}} and had her carpenters board it up, leaving much of the extensive earthquake damage unrepaired. Again, according to the legends, she thought the spirits were angry with her because she was spending too much time decorating and working on the front rooms. Construction resumed on new additions and remodeling the other parts <b>of</b> the structure. <b>Her</b> full-time address from the earthquake until her death was in Atherton, California. She visited the ranch and house in San Jose only periodically.|$|R
500|$|The video {{starts with}} a news anchor (played by Kristina Mitchell) saying {{the title of the}} song above a news banner that reads [...] "Britney Spears song lyrics spell out {{obscenity}} in disguise". This is a parody of an America's Newsroom report by Megyn Kelly. It then skips to a house, in which a sex party is coming to an end. Spears starts singing while {{sitting on the edge of}} a bed while the people that surround her are getting dressed. She gets up and looks out the window. As the first verse ends, she picks up a pair of panties from the floor, recalling her personal struggles and the [...] "Piece of Me" [...] video. She dances with four male dancers in the first chorus. During the second chorus, she dances with four other female dancers dressed in cheerleading outfits, while many men are watching them dance. The screen fades to white and Spears begins to change into a conservative '50s-inspired housewife outfit. As the chorus begins again, she comes out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom.</b> She walks down the stairs, with dancers surrounding her and a woman gives her a potholder, which she uses to pick up a pie. After this, she walks out the front door of the house and is joined by her seemingly conservative-looking husband and children, one of them dressed with the schoolgirl outfit Spears wore in the [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] video. As they go down the walkway, they are surrounded by paparazzi, who have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. While the kids and husband wave, Spears smiles for the camera and blows a kiss. The video then ends with the news anchor saying, [...] "Doesn't make any sense, does it?".|$|E

Polly finally agrees, but only on condition that Basil lends her money to purchase a car, which he has previously refused to do.|$|E
2500|$|In {{writing the}} novel, Montgomery was {{inspired}} by notes she had made {{as a young girl}} about a couple who were mistakenly sent an orphan girl instead of the boy they had requested yet decided to keep her. She drew upon her own childhood experiences in rural Prince Edward Island, Canada. Montgomery used a photograph of Evelyn Nesbit, which she had clipped from New York’s Metropolitan Magazine and put on the wall <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom,</b> as the model for the face of Anne Shirley and a reminder of her [...] "youthful idealism and spirituality." ...|$|E
60|$|Janet {{had given}} a most violent start {{when she opened the}} door <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mother's <b>bedroom</b> where the {{davenport}} stood; and Janet much resented being startled; no doubt that was the reason she was so cross, thought Barbara, but still it was very disagreeable.|$|R

Kercher was found dead on the floor <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom.</b> By the time the bloodstained fingerprints at the scene were identified as belonging to Rudy Guede, police had charged Kercher's American flatmate, Amanda Knox, and Knox's Italian boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito. The subsequent prosecutions of Knox and Sollecito received international publicity, with forensic experts and jurists taking a critical view of the evidence supporting the initial guilty verdicts.|$|E
2500|$|Some blamed Dann's {{family for}} {{defending}} and protecting her {{in spite of}} the signs of her deteriorating mental health. Investigations were hampered by the Wassermans' refusal to be interviewed by police or to provide access to Dann's psychiatric records—the records were eventually obtained by court order. On the night of Dann's death, the Wassermans allowed only a very brief search <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom,</b> after which they cleaned it and removed potential evidence. The police were criticized for not sealing off Dann's room as part of the crime scene. [...] Parents of the shooting victims subsequently sued the Wasserman family for damages.|$|E
2500|$|Vance {{was born}} Vivian Roberta Jones around July 26, 1909, in Cherryvale, Kansas, {{the second of}} Robert and Euphemia Jones' six children. When she was six years old, her family moved to Independence, Kansas, where she {{eventually}} began her dramatic studies at Independence High School with drama instructor Anna Ingleman. Her love of acting clashed with her mother's strict religious beliefs. [...] "Viv" [...] soon rebelled, often sneaking out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> and staying out after curfew. She changed her surname to Vance and moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico, to find work as an actress. Vance performed {{in the very first}} show at the Albuquerque Little Theatre in 1930. There she appeared in many other plays, including This Thing Called Love and The Cradle Song. The local theatre community helped pay her way to New York City to study under Eva Le Gallienne.|$|E

The Peeping Tom ended up being Tyler.|$|R
60|$|Of {{course there}} was some concern and dismay at the inn. Embrocations were used, and doctors were talked of, and heads were shaken, and a couch in the sitting-room was prepared, so that the poor injured one might eat her dinner without being driven to the {{solitude}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own <b>bedroom.</b>|$|R
50|$|With {{the support}} <b>of</b> <b>her</b> mother, Benali {{used to play}} dress up at family gatherings and perform to her guests, yet due to her shy nature, singing for a crowd was rather challenging. She would {{occasionally}} pretend being interviewed in front <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom’s</b> mirror. Before becoming an artist and musician, she hoped for a job that would allow her to travel and explore the world and even considered becoming a flight attendant. After finishing her science and mathematics studies {{at the age of}} 19, Benali returned to Brussels to study graphic design at the Institut Saint-Luc of Graphic Arts to express herself through imagery and artistry. After graduating, Benali became an independent artist and graphic designer. Soon her passion for music further nourished after performing at her friend’s birthday, which she considers the day it all started.|$|R
2500|$|She gained {{national}} attention for her {{participation in the}} botched kidnapping and murder of General Reynaldo Pérez Vega (nicknamed [...] "El Perro," [...] or [...] "the dog"). Pérez Vega was deputy commander of Anastasio Somoza’s National Guard. On March 8, 1978, Astorga invited the general to her apartment in Managua, hinting {{to him that the}} sexual favors he had long sought would be granted. When he arrived, however, three members of the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) [...] Hilario Sánchez, Raúl Venerio and Walter Ferreti [...] burst out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> closet and seized the general. The plan was to ransom him for jailed Sandinista revolutionaries, but Pérez Vega put up a struggle and was murdered. Later, with his throat slit, he was found wrapped in a Sandinista flag. Astorga said of his murder, [...] "It was not murder. He {{was too much of a}} monster." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Tenant of Wildfell Hall {{challenged}} the prevailing morals of the Victorian era. [...] Especially shocking was Helen's slamming <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{door in the}} face of her husband after continuing abuse. Charles Kingsley, in his review for Fraser's Magazine wrote: [...] "A people's novel of a very different school is The Tenant of Wildfell Hall. [...] It is, taken altogether, a powerful and an interesting book. [...] Not that it is a pleasant book to read, nor, as we fancy, has it been a pleasant book to write; still less has it been a pleasant training which could teach an author such awful facts, or give courage to write them. [...] The fault of the book is coarseness--not merely that coarseness of subject which will be the stumbling-block of most readers, and which makes it utterly unfit to be put into the hands of girls..." [...] Despite this, he believed that: [...] " [...] society owes thanks, not sneers, to those who dare to shew her the image of her own ugly, hypocritical visage".|$|E

As a result, Gretel becomes extremely fanatical in her {{support for the}} Third Reich, to the point <b>of</b> covering <b>her</b> <b>bedroom</b> wall with Nazi propaganda posters. Bruno is confused as the Jews he has seen, in particular the family's Jewish servant Pavel (David Hayman), do not resemble the caricatures in Liszt's teachings.|$|R
