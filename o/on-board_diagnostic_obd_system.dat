40|$|An {{organized}} {{systems design}} approach is {{dictated by the}} increasing complexity of computer based systems. Computer based systems are unique in many respects but share {{many of the same}} problems that have plagued design engineers for decades. The design of complex systems is difficult at best, but as a design becomes intensively dependent on the computer processing of external and internal information, the design process quickly borders chaos. This situation is exacerbated with the requirement that these systems operate with a minimal quantity of information, generally corrupted by noise, regarding {{the current state of the}} system. Establishing performance requirements for such systems is particularly difficult. This paper briefly sketches a general systems design approach with emphasis on the design of computer based decision processing systems subject to parameter and environmental variation. The approach will be demonstrated with application to an <b>on-board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> (<b>OBD)</b> <b>system</b> for automotive emissions systems now mandated by the state of California and the Federal Clean Air Act. The emphasis is on an approach for establishing probabilistically based performance requirements for computer based systems...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposed}} a speech-controlled real-time remote vehicle <b>on-board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> (<b>OBD)</b> <b>system</b> for telematics applications. The proposed system contains three main parts. They are OBD embedded global position system (GPS-OBD) module, speech-controlled interface, and vehicle surveillance server. In {{addition to the}} real-time vehicle time-location information including date, time, longitude, and latitude obtained from GPS receiver, the GPS-OBD module can also record the real-time vehicle operation information including vehicle speed, engine rpm, coolant temperature, battery voltage, fault code number, and others from OBD system. These real-time vehicle data, i. e., vehicle time-location and operation information, will be uploaded to the vehicle surveillance server via 3. 5 G network. Meanwhile, the GPS-OBD module can be operated through the speech-controlled interface. The derivers therefore could safely operate the proposed system via speech commands and keep {{their eyes on the}} road. The vehicle surveillance server is designed to provide real-time vehicle information retrieve service for authorized supervisors or servicemen. One can use a specific browser co-operated with Google Maps to retrieve real-time vehicle information, e. g., date, time, speed, vehicle location, and etc of the monitored vehicle. The proposed system is very useful for the detection of vehicle pollution, warning of vehicle malfunction, remote diagnosis, and roadside repair...|$|E

40|$|<b>On-board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> systems play an {{important}} role in the current generation of cars and will play an increasingly important role in the next future. The design of <b>on-board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> systems is a challenging problem under several points of view. In this paper we discuss the experience we made on such a problem within the VMBD project. In particular, we discuss an approach which tries to reconcile two goals: satisfying all the requirements and constraints imposed by the on-board application, and exploiting the advantages of the model-based approachasmuch as possible.

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of investigations regarding the use of <b>on-board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> systems to assess the technical state of automotive vehicles, and the possibilities of early fault detecting.

The investigations concerning the influence of examination conditions, the type of faults and the vehicle age upon the results and reliability of diagnostic tests were carried out. The suitability of fault codes which were recorded in the memory of diagnostic system while the vehicle was operating have been determined as far as the recognition of the type of faults is concerned. Additionally, the examinations of engine on a test stand were carried out as well. Sensitivity of diagnostic systems was tested regarding the changes of work parameters of the engine.

40|$|Many {{studies have}} proved that {{elements}} of driver’s behavior related to gear selec-tion have considerable {{influence on the}} fuel consumption. Optimal gear shifting is a complex task, especially for inexperienced drivers. This paper presents an imple-mented idea for gear shifting optimization {{with the aim of}} fuel consumption minimization with more efficient engine working regimes. Optimized gear shifting enables the best possible relation between vehicle motion regimes and engine work-ing regimes. New theoretical-experimental approach has been developed using <b>on-board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> technology which so far has not been used for this purpose. The matrix of driving modes according to which tests were performed is obtained and special data acquisition system and analysis process have been developed. Functional relations between experimental test modes and adequate engine work-ing parameters have been obtained and all necessary operations have been con-ducted to enable their use as inputs for the designed algorithm. The created model has been tested in real exploitation conditions on passenger car with Otto fuel in-jection engine and <b>on-board</b> <b>diagnostic</b> connection without any changes on it. The conducted tests have shown that the presented model has significantly positive ef-fects on fuel consumption which is an important ecological aspect. Further devel-opment and testing of the model allows implementation in wide range of motor ve-hicles with various types of internal combustion engines.
