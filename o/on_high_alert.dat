5|$|While at peak intensity, {{the storm}} {{threatened}} Mozambique and forcing authorities {{to put the}} country <b>on</b> <b>high</b> <b>alert.</b> The British Foreign Office also issued a travel warning to Britons who were planning visits along the Bazaruto Archipelago. Additionally, the South African disaster management team was on full alert in the eastern portion of Mpumalanga. In addition, thousands of volunteers were placed on stand by.|$|E
5|$|No. 825 Squadron FAA {{and their}} Fairey Swordfish were also made available. Lockheed Hudson's of No. 224 Squadron RAF and No. 233 Squadron RAF were also {{committed}} for reconnaissance operations. No. 22 Squadron RAF was recalled from leave {{to take part}} in any potential operation in the Channel. Hudsons from No. 407 Squadron RCAF were also available, and were placed <b>on</b> <b>high</b> <b>alert.</b> They took part in the fighting. RAF Bomber Command contributed its No. 5 Group RAF, containing some 242 of the 300 aircraft available to the service.|$|E
5|$|On 2 May 1945 {{news was}} {{received}} that all German forces {{west of the}} Isonzo River had surrendered. While this did not officially end the fighting in Italy, it was all but over. Five days later, {{on the night of}} 7 May, the battalion received the news that Germany had surrendered unconditionally to the Allies, and that the war in Europe was over. Nevertheless, tensions remained high and concerns about the intentions of Yugoslavia regarding the disputed province of Istria meant that the 28th (Māori) Battalion remained <b>on</b> <b>high</b> <b>alert.</b> This continued until early June when an agreement was reached and Yugoslavia withdrew its troops east of the Isonzo River.|$|E

50|$|Polls {{opened at}} 7:00 {{and there were}} over 52 million {{eligible}} voters {{to vote for the}} more than 18,000 positions. In addition, police and military forces were put <b>on</b> <b>higher</b> <b>alert</b> for expectations of violence which had resulted in about 60 deaths since campaigning began.|$|R
50|$|In {{reaction}} to a second major terrorist attack on a public transport system in the 7 July 2005 London bombings, the police deployed armed Police Tactical Unit officers to patrol within stations {{the day after the}} bombings occurred, while pre-existing security measures were placed <b>on</b> <b>higher</b> <b>alert.</b>|$|R
5|$|Positioning the Second and Third Armies {{with their}} {{bridging}} equipment along the canal {{in preparation for}} Operation Badr would put the Israelis <b>on</b> <b>high</b> <b>alert.</b> Without {{the element of surprise}} Egyptian forces would suffer high losses in the attack (estimates for casualties already ran in the thousands). The Directorate of Military Intelligence (abbreviated Aman), which formulated Israel's intelligence estimate and was known for its competency, was tasked with detecting troop movements and activity along Egyptian and Syrian forces; military activity which would be particularly intensive in the last days preceding the assault.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the system's first landfall, the EPHC {{noted the}} threat of high waves, storm surge, and flooding. In addition, the navy, army, and police were <b>on</b> <b>high</b> <b>alert</b> in {{populated}} areas like La Paz due to the hurricane. On the mainland, roughly 700 people evacuated to shelters in Huatampo, a city that at that time had a population of 9,000, and Yavaros prior to landfall, but within hours {{after the passage of}} the hurricane, all but 127 had returned home.|$|E
5|$|By April 1943, Western Area {{controlled}} four combat units: No.14 Squadron, flying Bristol Beaufort reconnaissance-bombers out of Pearce; No.25 Squadron, {{tasked with}} dive-bombing missions in Wirraways based at Pearce; No.76 Squadron, flying P-40 Kittyhawks out of Potshot (Exmouth Gulf); and No.85 Squadron, operating CAC Boomerang fighters from Pearce. The area command was {{also able to}} call on US Navy Catalinas of Patrol Wing10, based at Crawley, for reconnaissance and anti-submarine missions. The Beauforts and Catalinas flew several hundred maritime patrols during 1943. In March 1944, Western Area went <b>on</b> <b>high</b> <b>alert</b> in response to concerns that a Japanese naval force would raid Western Australia. Perth was reinforced with Nos.452 and 457 Squadrons, and Exmouth Gulf with Nos.18, 31, and 120 Squadrons, but no attack ensued and the units were directed {{to return to their}} home bases. The US Navy withdrew Patrol Wing10 mid-year, curtailing Western Area's ability to conduct long-range maritime reconnaissance; No.14 Squadron's fifteen serviceable Beauforts had to fly patrols of up to twenty-two hours in duration to search for German submarines reported in the area. As of 31May 1944, Western Area headquarters staff numbered 686, including 118 officers.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{communication}} technologies, and the Internet in particular, {{has been widely}} credited as contributor to the mobilisation of protests. A blog associated with Wired described the intricate efforts of the Tunisian authorities to control such online media as Twitter and Facebook.

5|$|The Command was too {{expensive}} to maintain and cost cuts were made during the 1950s which caused a reduction in strength. By mid-1957 the Command had been cut to 82 aircraft. By mid-1958 it had shrunk to just 67. The Shackletons dominated {{the core of this}} force, numbering 54 aircraft. The Neptune was cut from the service altogether, beginning on 31 August 1956. There was little operational action for the Command at this point. It airlifted British Army forces into Egypt during the Suez Crisis which was its major action during this period. The lack of funds and any active conventional military role saw the Command struggle to keep its front-line strength high. There was a brief alert in October 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, when all six squadrons it then possessed were put <b>on</b> <b>high</b> <b>alert,</b> but nothing came of the crisis, although the Shackleton squadrons at RAF Ballykelly were sent to Macrihanish as it was known that Ballykelly was on the Soviet IRBM target list.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{withdrawal}} from Vietnam brought {{to an end}} the doctrine of 'forward defence' through involvement in Southeast Asian wars. Instead, the Australian military's new focus was on the defence of continental Australia against external attack. In line with this change, the SASR {{took the lead in}} developing the Australian Army's capability to conduct patrol operations in Northern Australia. It was later recognised that this role required dedicated units with the Army forming three Regional Force Surveillance Units in the early 1980s trained by the SASR. In July 1977 two SASR patrols were deployed to north Irian Jaya with the approval of Indonesian authorities to provide first aid to the survivors of an RAAF Iroquois helicopter which had crashed in the remote jungle during survey operations, and to secure the wreckage from possibly being captured by members of the OPM independence movement. During this time the SASR also continued to train overseas with other special forces units. On one such exercise in the Philippines, a US special forces C-130 Hercules crashed into the South China Sea shortly after take-off from Subic Bay on 26 February 1981, killing 23 passengers including three Australians from the SASR, {{as well as a number}} of Americans, Filipinos, and New Zealanders. Meanwhile, following the Sydney Hilton bombing in February 1978, the SASR was given responsibility for providing Australia's military counter-terrorism response force, for which 2 Squadron was raised again in 1982. In addition to being able to respond to terrorist attacks in Australian cities, the SASR counter-terrorism unit was required to develop a capability to board ships underway and off-shore oil platforms together with clearance divers from the Navy Clearance Diving Branch. In May 1987 a squadron from the SASR was alerted for a possible deployment to Fiji as part of Operation Morris Dance, but did not leave Australia. The regiment was not involved in operations during the Gulf War in 1991 although two troops were again placed on standby for deployment at short notice, while other elements remained <b>on</b> <b>high</b> <b>alert</b> to respond to a terrorist incident in Australia if required.|$|E
25|$|According to a WikiLeaks cable, the Syrian {{government}} placed long-range missiles {{armed with}} chemical warheads <b>on</b> <b>high</b> <b>alert</b> {{after the attack}} but did not retaliate, fearing an Israeli nuclear counterstrike.|$|E
50|$|On October 16, 2007, Indonesian {{authorities}} {{ordered the}} evacuation of 30,000 residents living near Kelud, after scientists placed the volcano <b>on</b> the <b>highest</b> <b>alert</b> level, meaning that they expected an imminent eruption.|$|R
5|$|Graffham was envisioned {{as a way}} {{to bolster}} the aims of Fortitude North, and overall this aspect of the plan was successful. German documents, {{captured}} after the war, showed that, although they did not believe Norway to be the main invasion target, the Fortitude North units were considered capable of a diversionary attack. As a result of the deceptions, German forces in Scandinavia were put <b>on</b> <b>higher</b> <b>alert</b> and were not transferred south to reinforce France.|$|R

50|$|At {{the onset}} of the war, the {{squadron}} was based at Halwara AFS. Already <b>on</b> a <b>high</b> <b>alert,</b> the unit flew its first offensive sorties on the morning of 6 September, against targets of opportunity. Through the day, the unit would fly twelve missions supporting the Indian Army over the IB. The first fatality suffered was on the evening of the 6th, when a four ship formation was intercepted by PAF Sabres over Taran Taran. In the ensuing battle, SqnSqn Ldr AK Rawlley's aircraft hit the ground and exploded.|$|R

5000|$|Historical {{evidence}} released under Russian President Boris Yeltsin {{has been}} brought to light indicating that the Soviet Union did not plan to invade Poland. In fact, Jaruzelski actually tried to persuade the Soviets to invade Poland {{in order to support}} martial law, only to be sternly turned down. This left the Solidarity [...] "problem" [...] to be sorted out by the Polish government (see also Soviet reaction to the Polish crisis of 1980-1981). However, the exact plans of the Soviet Union at that time have never been determined. Jaruzelski, however, has justified cracking down by alleging that the threat of Soviet intervention was quite likely had he not dealt with Solidarity internally. This question, as well as many other facts about Poland in the years 1945-1989, are presently under the investigation of government historians at the Institute of National Remembrance (Instytut Pamięci Narodowej, IPN), whose publications reveal facts from the Communist-era archives. Additionally, there are numerous confirmations from Czech army officers of the time speaking of Operation Krkonoše, plan of armed invasion of Poland, because of which many units of the Czechoslovak People's Army were stationed <b>on</b> <b>highest</b> <b>alert,</b> ready for deployment within hours.|$|R
25|$|In response, the RAF readied all Tempests and Spitfires {{to attack}} any IAF {{aircraft}} they encountered and bomb IAF airfields. British {{troops in the}} Middle East were placed <b>on</b> <b>high</b> <b>alert</b> with all leave cancelled, and British citizens were advised to leave Israel. The Royal Navy was also placed <b>on</b> <b>high</b> <b>alert.</b> At Hatzor Airbase, the general consensus among the pilots, most of whom had flown with or alongside the RAF during World War II, was that the RAF would not allow the loss of five aircraft and two pilots to go without retaliation, and would probably attack the base at dawn the next day. That night, in anticipation of an impending British attack, some pilots decided not to offer any resistance and left the base, while others prepared their Spitfires and were strapped into the cockpits at dawn, preparing to repel a retaliatory airstrike. However, despite pressure from the squadrons involved in the incidents, British commanders refused to authorize any retaliatory strikes.|$|E
25|$|Multiple {{autoimmune}} disorders {{have been recorded}} with the neurovisceral and cutaneous genetic porphyrias including ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, celiac disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, diabetes, systemic and discoid lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, scleroderma, Sjogren's disease and scleritis. Physicians should be <b>on</b> <b>high</b> <b>alert</b> for porphyrias in families with {{autoimmune disorders}} and {{care must be taken}} with the use of potential porphyrinogenic drugs, including sulfasalazine.|$|E
25|$|Following this, and {{the rising}} {{tensions}} in the area coupled {{by the fact that}} the Sir Creek was a disputed territory, both the countries' militaries near the Rann of Kutch and nearby were put <b>on</b> <b>high</b> <b>alert.</b> Pakistan sent a company of marines, equipped with both laser guided and infrared homing shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles, to the site near the border.|$|E

President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo stated {{that there would be a}} full investigation of the explosion. She also said that the Philippine police and military were <b>on</b> their <b>highest</b> <b>alert</b> status, and that an additional 2,000 security officers were being deployed in public areas.|$|R
50|$|In New York City, {{although}} the celebrations marking the Rangers' first championship in 54 years were peaceful {{and there were}} no reports of violence or arrests, they were marred by the riots. Rudy Giuliani, who became the city's mayor just five months before, NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton, and Rangers President and General Manager Neil Smith said that the Rangers and people in New York City were in shock over the news of the riots and that the shockwaves of it had traveled to the city and put it <b>on</b> the <b>highest</b> <b>alert.</b> Bratton canceled days off for the New York City Police Department on June 17, 1994, the day of the parade for the Rangers, as a precaution against what happened in Vancouver happening in New York City.|$|R
