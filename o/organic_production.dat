The use of pesticides containing chemicals, such as sulfur, copper, microorganisms, viruses, clay powders, or plant extracts (pyrethrum, neem) has {{been approved by the}} EU Organic Standing Committee to improve organic yield and quality. A light coating of kaolin, which forms a physical barrier to some pests, also may help prevent apple sun scalding.|$|E

25|$|Tobacco {{water is}} a {{traditional}} organic insecticide used in domestic gardening. Tobacco dust can be used similarly. It is produced by boiling strong tobacco in water, or by steeping the tobacco in water for a longer period. When cooled, the mixture can be applied as a spray, or 'painted' on to the leaves of garden plants, where it kills insects. Tobacco is, however, banned from use as pesticide in certified <b>organic</b> <b>production</b> by the USDA's National Organic Program.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Organic</b> {{vegetable}} <b>production</b> is {{a system}} {{based on the principle}} of taking care of nature accounting all life forms. The research aimed to characterize <b>organic</b> vegetables <b>production</b> environment in Central Luzon, Philippines. Survey, key informants interview and focus group discussion were used in generating data from 72 organic vegetable farmers and 32 conventional vegetable growers from Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, and Zambales. Descriptive statistics, cost and return, input utilization, technology attributes, and extent of technology utilization were used in data analysis. The bio-physical, socio-economic and institutional environment in Central Luzon can provide good opportunity that can be tapped in promoting <b>organic</b> vegetable <b>production</b> in the region. The economic returns in <b>organic</b> vegetable <b>production</b> is promising and at par compared to conventional vegetable production. Low utilization of <b>organic</b> vegetable <b>production</b> technologies is apparent among farmers and their capacity to adopt organic farming standards including certification is also low. The constraints in <b>organic</b> vegetable <b>production</b> are many, but can be addressed through an integrated <b>organic</b> vegetable <b>production</b> program in the region. This calls for a holistic organic consciousness campaign, prioritization and localization of <b>organic</b> vegetable <b>production,</b> intensifying capability building, subsidizing and localizing organic certification, and effective price monitoring and dissemination mechanism...|$|R

Furthermore, biological control in the realisation of the <b>organic</b> agricultural <b>production</b> is indicated. Fundamental procedures of biological control in organic agriculture are related to providing quality of soil, water resources and feed. Moreover, the alternative forms of crop protection products are indicated. Specificities of alternative programmes are studied with the aim to produce organic food.

50|$|Compared to {{conventional}} milk <b>production,</b> <b>organic</b> milk <b>production</b> tends {{to have lower}} eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because <b>organic</b> milk <b>production</b> reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of {{the increased use of}} roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected <b>organic</b> milk <b>production</b> with increases in the emission of methane.|$|R

40|$|<b>Organic</b> beef <b>production</b> in Europe {{is based}} on grazing in the summertime and feeding of minimum 60 % of {{roughage}} during the whole year. Although these recommendations were intended to improve health and welfare several aspects may cause problems in <b>organic</b> beef <b>production</b> systems. This paper gives an overview of welfare, health and product quality in <b>organic</b> beef <b>production</b> with emphasis on <b>organic</b> steer <b>production</b> based on dairy breed bull calves. A short overview of different production systems is given with emphasis on the effect on health, and welfare. Feeding aspects are discussed. Farm {{studies have shown that}} <b>organic</b> steer <b>production</b> {{is based on}} high amounts of roughages, and only small amounts of cereals are used compared to a conventional production of bulls and calves. Fattening of organic steers may result in metabolic disorders due to sudden changes in the feed ration when changing from high roughage to high cereal content. The various problems related to the production system are discussed. Farm studies indicate a good general health and welfare in <b>organic</b> steer <b>production</b> system based on subjective monthly observations. On pasture, parasite infections may be the primary factor affections health and productivity in <b>organic</b> beef <b>production.</b> Rearing of the young calves and utilization of marginal grazing areas are two major fields, which requires further attention. The effect of castration on health and welfare and the effect of castration age and method are discussed. Product quality of organic beef is affected by the production system, especially sex, grazing and exercise. Grazing and exercise that are inevitable components of the <b>organic</b> beef <b>production</b> system may affect the eating quality of organic beef due to darker meat color, risk of off-flavor, yellow fat, and a higher content of unsaturated fatty acids including CLA. The general effect on sensory attributes might be of minor importance.

Despite the growing number of organic dairy operations, the characteristics of organic dairy operations and the relative costs of organic and conventional milk production have been difficult to analyze. This study, using 2005 ARMS data for U. S. dairy operations, which include a targeted sample of organic milk producers, examines the structure, costs, and challenges of <b>organic</b> milk <b>production.</b> The analysis addresses economies of size, regional differences, and pasture use in <b>organic</b> milk <b>production</b> and compares <b>organic</b> and conventional milk production costs.

40|$|Existing data {{on animal}} {{health and welfare}} in <b>organic</b> {{livestock}} <b>production</b> systems in the European Community countries are reviewed {{in the light of the}} demands and challenges of the recently implemented EU regulation on <b>organic</b> livestock <b>production.</b> The main conclusions and recommendations of a three-year networking project on <b>organic</b> livestock <b>production</b> are summarised and the future challenges to <b>organic</b> livestock <b>production</b> in terms of welfare and health management are discussed. The authors conclude that, whilst the available data are limited and the implementation of the EC regulation is relatively recent, there is little evidence to suggest that organic livestock management causes major threats to {{animal health and welfare}} in comparison with conventional systems. There are, however, some well-identified areas, like parasite control and balanced ration formulation, where efforts are needed to find solutions that meet with organic standard requirements and guarantee high levels of health and welfare. It is suggested that, whilst organic standards offer an implicit framework for animal health and welfare management, there is a need to solve apparent conflicts between the organic farming objectives in regard to environment, public health, farmer income and animal health and welfare. The key challenges for the future of <b>organic</b> livestock <b>production</b> in Europe are related to the feasibility of implementing improved husbandry inputs and the development of evidence-based decision support systems for health and feeding management.
