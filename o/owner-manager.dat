5|$|Johnson wrote a {{considerable}} part of Irene in 1737 while teaching at Edial Hall School, the academy he had founded in 1735. Johnson spent his evenings {{working on his}} play while ignoring his wife Elizabeth (known as Tetty). This provoked David Garrick, his student, to perform a skit mocking the incidents, although the incidents he portrayed were more than likely his own fabrications. However, the play was written mostly for Mrs. Johnson; she was fond of it and {{hoped it would be}} a success. Her belief in the play inspired Johnson to finish it and push to have it performed. When Edial Hall failed, Johnson travelled to London and brought the unfinished manuscript with him. In 1737, Johnson tried to submit Irene to Charles Fleetwood, the <b>owner-manager</b> of the Theatre Royal Drury Lane, but Fleetwood rejected it on the grounds that there was no patron and his theatre was catering to other types of performances. Johnson tried in 1741 to have the unperformed play printed, but this too failed. He seems to have continued to revise it over the next several years, since a manuscript notebook contains draft material made not earlier than June 1746.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine the relation between complex ownership structures and managerial compensation. More specifically, we examine the impact of the <b>owner-manager’s</b> excess control and the presence of multiple large shareholders (MLS) on the <b>owner-manager’s</b> compensation. Using a sample of French publicly listed firms, the results reveal several important points. First, the <b>owner-manager’s</b> compensation increases with the <b>owner-manager’s</b> excess control. This finding indicates that managers use their power to increase their pay, hence expropriating minority shareholders. Second, the presence of MLS decreases managerial opportunism and prevents <b>owner-managers</b> from diverting corporate resources for their own benefit. Hence, MLS play an important monitoring role...|$|R

The teams of the era were [...] "independents", barnstorming throughout the region and not affiliated with any organized league, though they did have salaries and were run as business organizations. On October 15, 1881, the strongest team in the area joined the American Association as a founding member to begin play in 1882. Their various home fields in the 19th century were in a then-separate city called Allegheny City, across the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh.

After five mediocre seasons in the A.A., Pittsburgh became the first A.A. team to switch to the older National League in 1887. At this time, the team renamed itself the Pittsburgh Alleghenys, although Allegheny remained a separate city until it was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907.

Despite all these efforts, however, SME survival rates have barely improved, if at all. There may be a good reason for this: entrepreneurs and SME <b>owner-managers</b> do not make maximum use of the services available. Results from a survey of 70 SME <b>owner-managers</b> show that the main barrier is lack of knowledge about the agencies providing the services. On the one hand, many <b>owner-managers</b> do not seem to understand the utility or relevance of the services, while on the other they do not seem to know enough about the agencies working in their region. However, most of the <b>owner-managers</b> who had used the agencies felt the services they had received were appropriate to their needs.

40|$|Orientation: This study {{focuses on}} {{effective}} mentoring of black small business <b>owner–managers.</b> It aims {{to gain an}} understanding of non-relational conditions necessary for the mentoring of their businesses. Research purpose: To identify non-relational-based conditions for effective mentoring of black small business <b>owner–managers.</b> Effective mentoring can help enhance business management skills and improve the survival of small businesses in South Africa. Motivation for the study: Previous research on mentoring mainly focused on relational conditions required for mentoring. It is equally important to investigate non-relational conditions required for mentoring and provide recommendations to help achieve effective mentoring of small business <b>owner–managers.</b> Research design, approach and method: An interpretivism paradigm and qualitative research methodology were followed. The experiences of participants were obtained through semi-structured interviews. Main findings: Conditions surrounding the accessibility of the mentoring location, accessibility of mentoring resources, capacity of mentors, financial support, marketing strategies and practical arrangements for the mentoring process are essential during mentoring of black small business <b>owner–managers.</b> Practical and managerial implications: Investigating the experiences of mentors, mentees and board members or managers provides insight into non-relational conditions required for effective mentoring of black small business <b>owner–managers.</b> Recommendations are provided to help enhance mentoring facilities and ultimately the success and longevity of small businesses. Contribution and value-add: Knowledge of non-relational conditions required for effective mentoring could result in successful skills development of <b>owner–managers.</b> Ultimately, the decision-making of <b>owner–managers</b> could be improved, and the success and longevity of their businesses could be enhanced...|$|R

30|$|This study {{investigated}} managerial work and proposed {{the description of}} managerial styles of small businesses <b>owner-managers</b> based on the process and roles approaches.

Thus, instead of overlapping, they appear to represent complementary descriptions about the work of small business <b>owner-managers</b> as interpreted by the <b>owner-managers</b> themselves.

40|$|Despite their {{importance}} to the UK economy micro-businesses have been neglected by academic researchers. This thesis contributes to our knowledge of such businesses by focusing on decision-making in the micro-business. The research involved 55 semi-structured interviews with the <b>owner-managers</b> of micro-businesses in three contrasting sectors: accounting, building and printing. The study found that micro-businesses {{play an important role}} in the economy and in particular may provide a more substantial contribution to employment than previous studies have indicated. In addition, the quasi-organisational form by which many micro-businesses operate means that such firms are often more sophisticated than implied by statistical data. An important influence on the decision-making process was found to be the effect of the <b>owner-manager's</b> individual, social and economic contexts. This contextual model provides the rationale for the way micro-business <b>owner-managers</b> make decisions. An important aspect of this model is that the interaction ofihe differing individual, social and economic contexts means that <b>owner-managers</b> experience unique influences and therefore develop specific ways of making decisions. A number of generalisations could nevertheless be advanced. Micro-business <b>owner-managers</b> tend to base their decisions on more intuitive methods combined with the mformal absorption of mformation. They also. often adopt nsk-mmmusmg decision strategies and employ satisflcing behaviour. Such appibaches could be criticised from a rational decision-making perspective. However, given the context of micro-business decision-making, such approaches can be regarded as perfectly rational. The conclusion arising from this research is that training and advice should focus upon enhancing the way micro-business <b>owner-managers</b> currently make decisions, rather than attempting to persuade them to adopt more comprehensive and so-called 'rational approaches'. Greater account also needs to be taken of the context within which decisions are made, particularly the objectives of <b>owner-managers.</b> This provides an important challenge to the existing paradigm that is based upon a perception that <b>owner-managers</b> should pursue objectives such as business growth and adopt more rational decision-making methods if they are to achieve this...|$|R

This research seeks {{to understand why the}} suggested lack of sustainable tourism implementation remains evident in tourism. Discussion from findings intends to draw attention to central themes relative to achieving research objectives and seeks to yield important information in the pursuit of sustainable tourism business. A qualitative, semi-structured interview approach was used to gain in-depth and detailed perspectives from <b>owner-managers</b> of micro and small tourism enterprises. <b>Owner-managers</b> interviewed were purposively chosen using non-probability sampling. Selection was based on providing a variety of tourism businesses and physical business locations across the case study region. Overall, findings suggest that <b>owner-managers</b> are implementing low levels of environmental management and have limited knowledge of what implementation of environmental management specifically involves, such as, how long it takes and how much it costs.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} growth and non-growth of small-and-medium-sized {{enterprises}} (SMEs) over the long-term. A multiple case study methodology {{was used to examine}} the growth paths of eight SMEs over a period of fourteen years. Four firms represented manufacturing and four, the professional and business services industry. The firms were paired according to similar sectors and contrasting growth paths. Longitudinal employment data illustrated the firms’ growth paths, and the primary method of data collection was semi-structured interviews of the firms’ <b>owner-managers.</b> The research incorporated extensive literature, including traditional research approaches and life cycle models and emergent literature on organisational learning and growth paths. The growth and non-growth firms were found to be distinct from each other, regardless of industry. The growth firms’ <b>owner-managers</b> had strong growth ambitions and actively sought the recognition and challenges that arise from the operation of multiple growth businesses. The non-growth <b>owner-managers</b> had passive growth ambitions and focused on maintaining their accustomed lifestyle. These differences were also illustrated in the firms’ approaches to networking, internationalisation and technological advancement. The growth firm <b>owner-managers</b> were all portfolio entrepreneurs and had strong professional networks, which they considered were strategically vital. In contrast, the non-growth <b>owner-managers</b> were novice entrepreneurs and were nonchalant towards networking. Innovation and flexibility were identified as important characteristics in the long-term performance of the firms. Findings also indicated that owner-managers’ perceptions of their external business environment determined the influence it had on the business.
