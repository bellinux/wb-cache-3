The machining system {{sets the}} limitations of dimensionalaccuracy and surface quality of a machined component. The capabilityof the machining system describes these limits in terms of specifiedvalues. This thesis deals with machining system capability analysismainly focused on machine tool static and dynamic stiffness. The influence of stiffness and flexibility on machining systemcapability is analytically and experimentally investigated. Theexperimental work presented in the thesis complies with the theoriesand shows the relation between machine tool capability and theoutcome on the machine component. The concept of capability analysis by elastic linked system andthe currently available tools for such an evaluation is presented anddiscussed. The basis of elastic linked system analysis is the use ofmeasurements under loaded condition. The machine tool is loadedwith a known force creating a test condition closer to real machining,compared to current methods of unloaded machine tools. Twomeasurement tools for elastic linked system capability analysis areexplained in the thesis: Loaded Double Ball Bar and ContactlessExcitation and Response System. The thesis consists of an analytical base and an experimental casestudy on spiral bevel gear face milling. The experiments are discussedand compiled with the given theories. QC 20130513 </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{aerospace}} {{manufacturing sector}} is continuously seeking automation {{due to increased}} demand {{for the next generation}} single-isle aircraft. In order to reduce weight and fuel consumption aircraft manufacturers have increasingly started to use more composites as part of the structure. The manufacture and assembly of composites poses different constraints and challenges compared to the more traditional aircraft build consisting of metal components. In order to overcome these problems and to achieve the desired production rate existing manufacturing technologies have to be improved. New technologies and build concepts have to be developed in order to achieve the rate and ramp up of production and cost saving. This paper investigates how to achieve the rib hole key characteristic (KC) in a composite wing box assembly process. When the rib hole KC is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerances,</b> possibly, the KC can be achieved by imposing it by means of adjustable tooling and fixturing elements. A test rig has been designed and built that is used to experimentally investigate the capability of both the tooling and fixturing concepts.

40|$|State {{of the art}} in {{multi-stage}} {{production systems}} is End-Of-Line (EOL) quality control. The main drawback of EOL inspection is the off-line inspection at {{the final stage of}} the manufacturing chain, where already all possible defects of the production chain have been accumulated. Thus, a defective workpiece is machined wasting time, money and energy resources for creating a final product, which is <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerances</b> and has to be recycled or scrapped. To overcome this drawback it is necessary to create solutions to reduce either defect generation or defect propagation. This paper focusses on the second approach, which aims at repairing defective workpieces by adapting consecutive process parameters in a multi-stage production system (downstream repair). By applying this concept to the production of electrical drives for power train applications, the effort needed for EOL testing can be reduced by shifting testing steps into the previous process chain. The currently used total flux measurement of laminated steel stacks is replaced by a space-resolved measurement. This permits the identification and local allocation of deviations in the magnetic field due to defective or weak magnets. The downstream repair strategy solves an optimization problem in order to compensate deviations in the magnetic field of single laminated steel stacks by adapting the assembly stage. Two repair strategies are discussed within this paper, namely sequential and selective assembly. In the proper assembling sequence, the laminated steel stacks are then assembled on the rotor according to the optimal assembling policy. Thus deviations of the laminated steel stacks are compensated. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E

The growth of quality standards of the products required by the customers implies to delve into methods of control. In the industrial activities less time is spent for control operations, more time and money are saved. This gain can be obtained only if the control is performed with a reliable measuring system and method. This paper focuses on an actual industrial problem: to obtain reliable measurements and, consequently, to develop reliable considerations when an industrial piece is measured on a Coordinate Measuring Machine. In a word, companies aim to obtain effectively reproducible phenomena when the same dimension is measured. Their real need is the possibility to understand and to manage the uncertainty, reducing the probability that good pieces will be considered <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>tolerances</b> and the ones really out will be wrongly accepted. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} show the importance of these statements, to study and assess the variability of the measurement system by using a CMM. The measurement uncertainty is a quantitative expression of one's belief in the closeness of a measurement value to the "true value" of the measurand. Many factors, according to the standard prescriptions and the specific environment, have to be included in the uncertainty evaluation. In order to evaluate the metrological and industrial points of view, comparing information and results achieved from uncertainty calculation and industrial considerations, a real example is shown. First, the uncertainty of a CMM is considered, following the international standards and including the main sources of variability. Estimating the total variability must consider the difficulty due to the fact that coordinate measuring systems are multipurpose measuring instruments whose factors vary with the task being performed, the measurement, the environment, the operator and the chosen measurement method.

A randomly chosen sample of 9 % (124 skis/ 62 pairs) of S-B-B systems from the total ski rental fleet was tested using a Wintersteiger calibration machine. There were a high percentage of Class I deviations in the rental fleet: 50 % (2 seasons), 95 % (3 seasons), and 64 % (4 seasons). Class 1 deviations do not require corrective action; however, increased sampling is indicated. Based on the high percentage of Class I deviations the entire fleet should be inspected.

40|$|Purpose: On 1 July 2012, the Australian Clinical Dosimetry Service (ACDS) {{released}} its Optically Stimulated Luminescent Dosimeter (OSLD) Level I audit, replacing the previous TLD based audit. The {{aim of this}} work is to present {{the results from this}} new service and the complete uncertainty analysis on which the audit tolerances are based. Methods: The audit release was preceded by a rigorous evaluation of the InLight® nanoDot OSLD system from Landauer (Landauer, Inc., Glenwood, IL). Energy dependence, signal fading from multiple irradiations, batch variation, reader variation, and dose response factors were identified and quantified for each individual OSLD. The detectors are mailed to the facility in small PMMA blocks, based on the design of the existing Radiological Physics Centre audit. Modeling and measurement were used to determine a factor that could convert the dose measured in the PMMA block, to dose in water for the facility&# 039;s reference conditions. This factor is dependent on the beam spectrum. The TPR 20, 10 was used as the beam quality index to determine the specific block factor for a beam being audited. The audit tolerance was defined using a rigorous uncertainty calculation. The audit outcome is then determined using a scientifically based two tiered action level approach. Audit outcomes within two standard deviations were defined as Pass (Optimal Level), within three standard deviations as Pass (Action Level), and outside of three standard deviations the outcome is Fail (<b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tolerance).</b> Results: To-date the ACDS has audited 108 photon beams with TLD and 162 photon beams with OSLD. The TLD audit results had an average deviation from ACDS of 0. 0 % and a standard deviation of 1. 8 %. The OSLD audit results had an average deviation of − 0. 2 % and a standard deviation of 1. 4 %. The relative combined standard uncertainty was calculated to be 1. 3 % (1 σ). Pass (Optimal Level) was reduced to ≤ 2. 6 % (2 σ), and Fail (<b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tolerance)</b> was reduced to > 3. 9 % (3 σ) for the new OSLD audit. Previously with the TLD audit the Pass (Optimal Level) and Fail (<b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>Tolerance)</b> were set at ≤ 4. 0 % (2 σ) and > 6. 0 % (3 σ). Conclusions: The calculated standard uncertainty of 1. 3 % at one standard deviation is consistent with the measured standard deviation of 1. 4 % from the audits and confirming the suitability of the uncertainty budget derived audit tolerances. The OSLD audit shows greater accuracy than the previous TLD audit, justifying the reduction in audit tolerances. In the TLD audit, all outcomes were Pass (Optimal Level) suggesting that the tolerances were too conservative. In the OSLD audit 94 % of the audits have resulted in Pass (Optimal level) and 6 % of the audits have resulted in Pass (Action Level). All Pass (Action level) results have been resolved with a repeat OSLD audit, or an on-site ion chamber measurement...|$|R
