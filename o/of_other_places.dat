5|$|Because {{it is so}} {{far from}} the nearest major landmass, the {{ecosystem}} of Kohala has experienced the phenomenon of geographic isolation, resulting in an ecosystem radically different from that <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>places.</b> Invasive species introduced by man present a problem to Kohala's ecosystem, as they push native species out of their habitat. There are several initiatives to preserve Kohala's ecosystem. Crops, especially sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), have been harvested on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries as well. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial doubts by Nintendo's American staff, Donkey Kong succeeded commercially and {{critically}} in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed {{the game to}} Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms. Other companies cloned Nintendo's hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto's characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, and dozens <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>places.</b> A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging Donkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed. The success of Donkey Kong and Nintendo's victory in the courtroom helped to position the company for video game market dominance from its release in 1981 until the late 1990s (1996–1999).|$|E

25|$|Reynier {{finally began}} his {{retreat to the}} north on 26 July, pursued by 8,000 partisans under Don Nicola Gualtieri, also known as Pane di Grano. The Imperial French troops sacked and burned every village that {{resisted}} them along their route. At Strongoli the guerillas had captured 17 French soldiers and tortured and killed one victim every day. After dropping off its wounded at Cotrone, Reynier's column arrived unexpectedly on 29 July and rescued the ten survivors. Strongoli suffered the same fate <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>places</b> that resisted. On 1 August at Corigliano Calabro, Reynier's men fought a pitched battle with the partisans. After routing the Calabrians with heavy losses, the town was burned. Eventually, Reynier reached Cassano where he joined Verdier who had seized the town at bayonet point after a bitter struggle.|$|E

500|$|Produced by Madlib, [...] "The Healer" [...] is an ode to hip hop {{culture and}} a {{proclamation}} of its scope.

Frere-Jones notes [...] "bells, unidentifiable knocks, a lonesome instrument {{that might be a}} sitar, or a guitar, and lots of empty space" [...] in the musical backdrop, adding that [...] "the music flirts with total stasis, though it still has an audible beat." [...] Badu's lyrics, delivered in an incantation style, make reference to various names of God, including Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Jah, and Rastafari, while asserting hip hop to be [...] "bigger than" [...] social institutions such as religion and government. She explained the lyrics and religious references, saying [...] "to me, hip-hop is felt in all religions - it has a healing power. I've recently been to Palestine, Jerusalem, Africa and a bunch <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>places,</b> and everyone is listening to hip-hop. There's something about that kicking snare sound that all kinds of people find meaning in." [...] The autobiographical song [...] "Me" [...] discusses Badu's thoughts and feelings about her life, including the struggle of growing as a public figure. She mocks others' perception of her, which she has explained as [...] "everything you can see of Erykah Badu — the Ankhs, the powers, the 5 Percenters, the mysteries, it’s all true. The lies; it’s all true. Had two babies with different daddies. Thirty-six years old and addicted to a variety of spending." [...] The song's jazz conclusion has Badu singing about her mother's life and resilience in unison with a muted trumpet.|$|E

2500|$|Critics and {{scholars}} have sometimes scrutinised Australian culture, with {{aspects of it}} loosely criticised for being kitsch, low-brow or rooted in poor taste. The term [...] "cultural cringe" [...] was coined to describe this entrenched national inferiority complex which assumes ideas and cultures <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>places</b> are automatically superior.

2500|$|Georgia {{literature}} is distinct among the literature <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>places</b> {{in the world}} in its historical and geographical context and the values it imparts to people who enjoy the state's literature. Dramas such as the play-turned-movie Driving Miss Daisy are one example of Georgia's literary culture while better known fiction novels such as Margaret Mitchell's Gone With the Wind and The Color Purple by Alice Walker (The Color Purples stage adaptation is by Georgia Author and Agnes Scott Alumna Marsha Norman) are other examples. Among the most interesting of Southern literature's genres is Southern Gothic, with such notable Georgia writers as Flannery O'Connor and Erskine Caldwell. [...] Georgia's poets, such as Sidney Lanier, nonfiction writers like humorist Lewis Grizzard also have a place in the state's literary background.|$|E
