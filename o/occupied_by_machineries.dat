2500|$|Thirty-five {{percent of}} the space inside the {{pressure}} hull was <b>occupied</b> <b>by</b> <b>machinery.</b> A single 8-cylinder [...] diesel engine was installed for surface propulsion, while high underwater speed was given by two large electric motors arranged one behind the other to drive the single propeller shaft, and powered by a 200-cell battery of the same type fitted to J-class submarines. The large battery was, however, sufficient for only about an hour at full power. In addition, the engine took a full day to charge the batteries, using half its power. Charging was therefore undertaken in harbour, using a supply of electricity from the shore or from special battery charging vessels.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyzed}} {{the position of}} the Romanian trademarks using the data provided by Unlock Market Research Company in 2010 and 2014. The statistical parameters: average, variance, standard deviation and variation coefficient, and the Point Method and Comparison Method were used to process the collected data. In 2014, among the top 50 brands in Romania's market, the top 10 positions were <b>occupied</b> <b>by</b> the following trademarks: Borsec, Dero, Gerovital, Dorna, Arctic, Dacia, Elmiplant, Aqua Carpatica, Farmec and Petrom. Food industry came on the 1 st position with 17 brands and on the 3 rd position after telephony and finance and banking, based on the average positions of its trademarks. By field of activity, based on the average position, the 1 st three positions were <b>occupied</b> <b>by</b> <b>Machinery</b> construction and Chemical and extractive industry, Alcoholic beverages, and Wood working industry. On the last position was situated Telephony. As a final conclusion, consumers behavior reflected an intensive orientation to the Romanian brands belonging to food industry, care and health sector and also of the appliances for household reflecting a new behavior to assure a higher living standards...|$|R

40|$|RNA {{polymerase}} III (Pol III) transcribes small untranslated RNAs, such as tRNAs. To {{define the}} Pol III transcriptome in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we performed genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation using subunits of Pol III, TFIIIB and TFIIIC. Virtually {{all of the}} predicted targets of Pol III, {{as well as several}} novel candidates, were <b>occupied</b> <b>by</b> Pol III <b>machinery.</b> Interestingly, TATA box-binding protein occupancy was greater at Pol III targets than virtually all Pol II targets, and the highly occupied Pol II targets are generally strongly transcribed. The temporal relationships between factor occupancy and gene activity were then investigated at selected targets. Nutrient deprivation rapidly reduced both Pol III transcription and Pol III occupancy of both a tRNA gene and RPR 1. In contrast, TFIIIB remained bound, suggesting that TFIIIB release is not a critical aspect of the onset of repression. Remarkably, TFIIIC occupancy increased dramatically during repression. Nutrient addition generally reestablished transcription and initial occupancy levels. Our results are consistent with active Pol III displacing TFIIIC, and with inactivation/release of Pol III enabling TFIIIC to bind, marking targets for later activation. These studies reveal new aspects of the kinetics, dynamics, and targets of the Pol III system...|$|R

50|$|The {{striped skunk}} may dig its own dens, {{though it will}} {{appropriate}} those abandoned by other animals should the opportunity present itself. These dens are normally used only in late fall, winter, and early spring, while females with unweaned kits make use of them in late spring and summer. In cultivated areas, striped skunks will dig their dens in fencerows, likely because {{they are less likely}} to be disturbed <b>by</b> <b>machinery</b> or livestock. In winter it is common for a single den to be <b>occupied</b> <b>by</b> multiple females and a single male. During this period, the striped skunk saves its energy by lowering its body temperature from 38 °C to 32 °C. Although it will forage for short periods in winter, it primarily depends on its fat reserves in cold weather, and can lose as much as 50% of its body weight.|$|R
