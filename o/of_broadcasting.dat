5|$|Television {{broadcasting}} in Winnipeg {{started in}} 1954. The federal government refused to license any private broadcaster until the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{had created a}} national network. In May 1954, CBWT {{went on the air}} with four hours <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting</b> per day. There are now five English-language stations and one French-language station based in Winnipeg. Additionally, some American network affiliates are available over-the-air. Winnipeg is home to 33 AM and FM radio stations, two of which are French-language stations. CBC Radio One and CBC Radio 2 broadcast local and national programming in the city. NCI is devoted to Aboriginal programming.|$|E

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis, "The contemporary religious <b>broadcasting</b> <b>of</b> the Czech radio : 20 {{years after}} end of communism era", {{deals with the}} operation of the Editorial Staff <b>of</b> Religious <b>Broadcasting.</b> The said editorial staff has been preparing programmes with religious themes in the Czech Radio for 20 years running. Since its formation in 1990, the religious broadcasting has gone through a long development in the domain <b>of</b> public <b>broadcasting.</b> Despite the social trends in the Czech Republic associated with a generally falling interest in religious matters, religious broadcasting maintains firmly its footing in the Czech Radio, enjoying a positive response from the audience. In 2009 alone, the Editorial Staff <b>of</b> Religious <b>Broadcasting</b> has prepared 391 hours of programme with religious themes and plans further expansion of its production. The religious editorial staff also operates its own website where it offers social-religious themed information as well as an archive of its programmes.

5|$|Development {{continued}} largely at {{the urging}} of the Admiralty, who saw it as a solution to detecting the conning towers of partially submerged U-Boats. After a visit by Tizard to GEC's Hirst Research Centre in Wembley in November 1939, and a follow-up visit by Watt, the company took up development and developed a working 25cm set using modified VT90s by the summer of 1940. With this success, Lovell and a new addition to the Airborne Group, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, began experimenting with horn-type antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy. Instead <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting</b> the radar signal across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft and listening to echoes from everywhere in that volume, this system would allow the radar to be used like a flashlight, pointed in the direction of observation. This would greatly increase the amount of energy falling on a target, and improve detection capability.|$|E

5|$|From {{a global}} perspective, {{there have been}} {{political}} debates and legislation regarding the management of telecommunication and broadcasting. The history <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting</b> discusses some debates in relation to balancing conventional communication such as printing and telecommunication such as radio broadcasting. The onset of World War II brought on the first explosion of international broadcasting propaganda. Countries, their governments, insurgents, terrorists, and militiamen have all used telecommunication and broadcasting techniques to promote propaganda. Patriotic propaganda for political movements and colonization started the mid-1930s. In 1936, the BBC broadcast propaganda to the Arab World to partly counter similar broadcasts from Italy, which also had colonial interests in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, sports channel ESPN won {{the right}} to {{broadcast}} Bowl Championship Series games between 2011 and 2014. In compensation, it agreed to pay the BCS $125million per year, more than a competing bid from Fox ($100million), which had been paying $82.5million per year for the contract that ended in 2010. To balance the higher cost <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting</b> the games, ESPN demanded more money for title sponsorship of each game. Shipping company FedEx, which had become the Orange Bowl's title sponsor in 1990 and was the longest continuous sponsor of any bowl game, balked at ESPN's increased demands—about $20million per year and required advertising outside the Orange Bowl—and ended its sponsorship.|$|E
5|$|Martin Filler {{acknowledged}} that the film legitimately used artistic licence to make valid dramatic points, {{such as in the}} probably imagined scene when George V lectures his son on the importance <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting.</b> Filler cautions that George VI would never have tolerated Logue addressing him casually, nor swearing, and the King almost certainly would have understood a newsreel of Hitler speaking in German. Filler makes the larger point that both the King and his wife were, in reality, lukewarm towards Churchill because of the latter's support for his brother during the abdication crisis. They only warmed to Churchill later in the war, because of his performance as a wartime leader.|$|E

5|$|Other {{political}} stations {{include the}} likes of Galaxy FM, founded in the early 1980s and gaining a strong audience by the late 80's after becoming consistent reliable station broadcasting mostly on Fridays, weekends and Monday mornings. Galaxy FM did attempt to broadcast 24 hours on the FM briefly and did advertise for a short time, before returning to broadcasting mostly on Fridays, weekends and Monday mornings after 1992 with no profit making adverts. It was not until June 2012 Galaxy FM attempted to broadcast 24 hours {{a day on the}} FM again and deliberately continued to not use profit making advertisements to maintain the station. However, in late September/early October 2012 due to constant attacks from the authorities the station {{decided to go back to}} its original schedule, this time with an additional day and a half <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting</b> per week; broadcasting on the FM from Thursday afternoons until Monday afternoons.

5|$|Some {{international}} broadcasters {{have turned}} to a digital mode <b>of</b> <b>broadcasting</b> called Digital Radio Mondiale for their shortwave outlets. One reason is that digital shortwave broadcasts using DRM can cover the same geographic region with much less transmitter power — roughly one-fifth the power — than traditional AM mode broadcasts, significantly reducing the electricity cost of operating a station. A traditional AM (analog) international shortwave station can have a power rating of 50 kilowatts {{to as much as}} one million watts per transmitter, with typical power levels in the 50–500 kilowatt range. Endorsed by the ITU, it has been approved as an international standard for digital broadcasts on the HF (shortwave) bands. A DRM broadcast rivals FM mono quality and can also send graphic images and web pages via a separate information channel.|$|E
