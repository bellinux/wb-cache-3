Knudsen Compressors operate by imposing a temperature gradient across a high porosity, low thermal conductivity transpiration membrane, typically a silicon aerogel membrane. Previous optimization studies have concluded that significant reductions of both energy consumption and device volume per unit throughput and pressure difference can be achieved when each stage of the cascade operates with a Knudsen Number based on the mean pore radius of approximately one. Perforated aerogels (using the same bulk aerogel material, but with machined arrays of properly sized parallel capillaries) are appealing candidate low-pressure transpiration membranes and {{are the focus of}} this investigation. Conventional drilling techniques using micro drills have successfully demonstrated perforated aerogel with pore diameters ranging from 210 µm to 1 mm. This range of pore sizes corresponds to efficient Knudsen Compressor operation between roughly 1 Torr and 10 mTorr.

40|$|In this paper, {{a hybrid}} heat pipe is {{proposed}} {{for use in}} advanced nuclear power plants as a passive heat transfer device. The hybrid heat pipe combines the functions of a heat pipe and a control rod to simultaneously remove the decay heat generated from the core and shutdown the reactor under accident conditions. Thus, the hybrid heat pipe contains a neutron absorber in the evaporator section, which corresponds {{to the core of}} the reactor pressure vessel. The presence of the neutron absorber material leads to differences in the heated diameter and hydraulic diameter of the heat pipe. The cross-sectional areas of the vapor paths through the evaporator, adiabatic, and condenser sections are also different. The hybrid heat pipe must operate in a high-temperature, high-pressure environment to remove the decay heat. In other words, the operating pressure must be higher than those of the commercially available thermosyphons. Hence, the thermal performances, including operation limit of the hybrid heat pipe, were experimentally studied in the <b>operating</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>range</b> of 0. 2 - 20 bar. The operating pressure of the hybrid heat pipe was controlled by charging the non-condensable gas which is unused method to achieve the high saturation pressure in conventional thermosyphons.

The operation limit of the hybrid heat pipe increased with the operating pressure.
