40|$|Science {{return and}} high {{bandwidth}} communications are key issues {{to support the}} foreseen endeavours on spaceflights to the Moon and beyond. For a given mass, power consumption and volume, laser communications can offer an increase in TM bandwidth over classical RF technology allowing {{for a variety of}} new options, specifically to missions that require very large distances, such as to the Moon and even beyond. This increase in TM data rate allows for more raw scientific data to be sent back to Earth where data processing can be performed on ground. Enhanced sensing techniques could be used that generate more science data and access during flight could be faster. This paper presents an overview of proof of concept test results obtained for <b>optical</b> <b>telemetry</b> return in a field test campaign together with ESA in October 2007.

40|$|We have {{developed}} an <b>optical</b> <b>telemetry</b> system for recording electrical signals associated with muscle and neuronal activities from freely walking crayfish under water. The device was made from conventional electronic parts which are commercially available, utilizing infrared light (880 nm) for signal transmission. Two or four channels of biological signals were multiplexed, the voltage of each data point modulated to the duration of subcarrier pulses and further to the interval of narrower carrier pulses that directly drove the infrared light emission diode (IRLED) under water. The light-pulse modulated signals were received by photodiodes and demodulated to restore the original two or four channel signals. Electrical recordings using wired electrodes and conventional amplifiers revealed that the optically transmitted signals {{were consistent with the}} wire-transmitted ones. In order to test the performance of this system, we recorded electromyograms (EMGs) from the second and third walking legs on each side of crayfish together with the neuronal activity in the ventral nerve cord. The results confirmed our previous observation in tethered crayfish that the background tonus of leg muscles showed an increase preceding their rhythmic activation...|$|E

40|$|Crustacean posture {{control is}} based on a complex {{interaction}} between the statocyst input and other sensory inputs as well as the animal's behavioral context. We examined the effects of behavioral condition on the activity of descending statocyst pathways using an <b>optical</b> <b>telemetry</b> system that allowed underwater recording of neuronal signals from freely behaving crayfish. A functionally identified statocyst-driven interneuron that directionally responded to body tilting without a footboard and to tilting of the footboard was found to show complicated responses depending upon the ongoing behavior of the animal when it freely walked around in water on the aquarium floor. The spike firing frequency of the interneuron increased significantly during walking. When the animal stood or walked on the tilted floor, the interneuron activity represented the tilt angle and direction if the abdomen was actively flexed, but not if it was extended. Two other statocyst-driven descending interneurons were found to be affected differently by the animal's behavioral condition: the spike activity of one interneuron increased during walking, but its directional response on the tilted floor was completely absent during abdominal posture movements, whereas that of another interneuron was enhanced during abdominal extension only, representing the tilt angle and direction. The results obtained in this study provide the first experimental demonstration that crustacean postural control under natural conditions is dependent on very fine aspects of the animal's locomotor behavioral context, suggesting far more complex control mechanisms than those expected from the experimental data obtained in isolated and fixed animals...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} an acquisition and tracking scheme for downlink <b>optical</b> <b>telemetry</b> {{that is based}} on a correlation-type technique developed for extended sources covering several elements of the detector array. The purpose of developing such a scheme is to enable simultaneous beam tracking and data detection using a small number of optical sensors. The open-loop acquisition derived from the maximum-likelihood criterion involves a transform-domain correlation between the received laser image and the reference image derived from the known intensity profile of the transmitting laser. The optimal acquisition algorithm requires solving two nonlinear equations, or iteratively solving their linearized variants, to estimate the coordinate of the transmitting laser when a rotation-invariant movement is considered. A maximumlikelihood -based closed-loop tracking algorithm is developed as well, in which the loop feedback signals are formulated as weighted transform-domain correlations between the received laser image and the previously estimated reference image. This scheme is expected to be able to achieve sub-pixel resolutions in a high-disturbance environment. I. Introduction Free-space laser communication is a promising technology to meet the demand for cost-effective wideband support for future NASA missions.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the role of tyrosine kinase cellular-Src (c-Src) inhibition on connexin 43 (Cx 43) regulation in a mouse model of myocardial infarction (MI). BackgroundMI is associated with decreased expression of Cx 43, the principal gap junction protein responsible for propagating current in ventricles. Activated c-Src has been linked to Cx 43 dysregulation. MethodsMI was induced in 12 -week-old mice by coronary artery occlusion. MI mice were treated with c-Src inhibitors (PP 1 Â orÂ AZD 0530), PP 3 (an inactive analogue of PP 1), or saline. Treated hearts were compared to sham mice byÂ echocardiography, <b>optical</b> mapping, <b>telemetry</b> electrocardiographic monitoring, and inducibility studies. TissuesÂ were collected for immunoblotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry. ResultsActive c-Src was elevated in PP 3 -treated MI mice compared to sham at the scar border (280 %, pÂ = 0. 003) and distal ventricle (346 %, pÂ = 0. 013). PP 1 treatment restored active c-Src to sham levels at the scar border (86 %, pÂ = 0. 95) and distal ventricle (94 %, pÂ = 1. 0). PP 1 raised Cx 43 expression by 69 % in the scar border (pÂ = 0. 048) and by 73 % in the distal ventricle (pÂ = 0. 043) compared with PP 3 mice. PP 1 -treated mice had restored conduction velocity at the scar border (PP 3 : 32 cm/s, PP 1 : 41 cm/s, pÂ < 0. 05) and lower arrhythmic inducibility (PP 3 : 71 %, PP 1 : 35 %, pÂ < 0. 05) than PP 3 mice. PP 1 did not change infarct size, electrocardiographic pattern, or cardiac function. AZD 0530 treatment demonstrated restoration of Cx 43 comparable to PP 1. Conclusionsc-Src inhibition improved Cx 43 levels and conduction velocity and lowered arrhythmia inducibility after MI, suggesting a new approach for arrhythmia reduction following MI...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 60 - 71 This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} the authors' experience gained from implementation of model-based monitoring systems for LNG string vibration. The development of a novel train torsional vibration monitoring approach utilizing system modal analysis and lateral-torsional coupling in geared systems has been reported. A number of recent Root Cause Analysis programs related to turbocompressor string operation problems (LNG production) have faced barriers due to lack of adequate torsional vibration monitoring solutions. As the machinery problems associated with abnormal levels of train torsional vibration become more frequent, the incentives for the Oil & Gas industry to address the need for reliable and trouble-free cyclic torque evaluation gain ground. This constitutes a demand for a robust, reliable and accurate torsional vibration monitoring approach acceptable as a practical solution. Contemporary, industry-wide accepted measurement technologies (strain gage with <b>telemetry,</b> <b>optical</b> probes, laser) fit the test needs well but their lack of ruggedness and durability as well as problematic installation impacting machine operation do not permit their consideration for long-term monitoring applications. The authors present a methodology which allows evaluation of alternating torque amplitudes in different string sections based on standard instrumentation installed on the train. The approach adopted in this paper relies heavily on the modal representation of the dynamic system being analyzed. The calculation method described utilizes the results of such analysis along with the angular vibration signal obtained from standard instrumentation installed on the train (gas turbine speed pick-up signal spectrum) and typical radial vibration data from gearbox proximity probes (when available). This means that no additional probes need to be installed to get the results. The robustness and accuracy of the proposed techniques was validated in the laboratory and benchmarked against test data from several LNG production train measurement campaigns, where the alternating torque was measured by means of standard measurement systems. The authors show the results of this verification together with prospective system applications. The symbols and abbreviations used in this paper are given in the last section...|$|R
