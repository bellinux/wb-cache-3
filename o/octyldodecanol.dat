40|$|Although <b>octyldodecanol</b> {{has been}} used for several decades as an {{ingredient}} for emulsions, no required Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance (HLB) values for this alcohol were found in the literature. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to present the results of the experimental determination of the required HLB values, from emulsion stability tests and from low-frequency relative dielectric permittivity measurements. The required HLB values obtained from emulsion stability tests for oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions are 11. 2 and 5. 9, respectively. By relative dielectric permittivity measurements, the required HLB value obtained for oil-in-water emulsions was 10. 9 Â± 0. 4, in agreement with the results from emulsion stability tests...|$|E
