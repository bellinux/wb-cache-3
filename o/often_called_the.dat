5|$|Pierce and his {{administration}} used threats and promises to keep most Democrats on board {{in favor of the}} bill. The Whigs split along sectional lines; the conflict destroyed them as a national party. The Kansas–Nebraska Act was passed in May 1854 and would come to define the Pierce presidency. The political turmoil that followed the passage saw the short-term rise of the nativist and anti-Catholic American Party, <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Know Nothings, and the founding of the Republican Party.|$|E
5|$|The Ancient Greek term acra {{was used}} to {{describe}} other fortified structures during the Hellenistic period.

5|$|The He 111 was a {{twin-engine}} {{version of}} the Blitz, preserving the elliptical inverted gull wing, small rounded control surfaces and BMW engines, so that the new design was <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Doppel-Blitz ("Double Lightning"). When the Dornier Do 17 displaced the He 70, Heinkel needed a twin-engine design to match its competitors. Heinkel spent 200,000 man hours designing the He 111. The fuselage length was extended to just over 17.4m/57ft (from 11.7m/38ft 4½in) and wingspan to 22.6m/74ft (from 14.6m/48ft).|$|E
5|$|The University of Paris, {{founded in}} the 12th century, is <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Sorbonne after one of its {{original}} medieval colleges. It was broken up into thirteen autonomous universities in 1970, following the student demonstrations in 1968.

5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> secondary, {{consists of}} cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line {{up outside the}} defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|E
5|$|The {{smallest}} region, the flocculonodular lobe, is <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> vestibulocerebellum. It is {{the oldest}} part in evolutionary terms (archicerebellum) and participates mainly in balance and spatial orientation; its primary connections are with the vestibular nuclei, although it also receives visual and other sensory input. Damage to this region causes disturbances of balance and gait.|$|E

5|$|In 1531, the ikki {{control of}} Kaga was of such {{dominance}} that a conflict for leadership within the Hongan-ji embroiled the province {{in a civil}} war, <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Daishō-Ikki, or Big League-Little League, war. A faction led by Renjun, a son of Rennyo, {{came to power in}} the Hongan-ji, and was hostile to the three main Kaga temples. In the resultant war, the three Kaga temples were backed by the Togashi clan, other powerful vassals, local Hongan-ji priests, and the ikki based in Echizen. Renjun was backed by many of the smaller temples and emerged victorious from the conflict when he brought in an Ikkō-Ikki army from Mikawa Province. Togashi Taneyasu was exiled, as were the other opposition leaders, and the position of shugo abolished.|$|E
5|$|In English, Jonathan Swift (30 November 1667 – 19 October 1745), <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> {{foremost}} satirist in the English language, gained fame for {{works such}} as Gulliver's Travels and A Modest Proposal. Other notable eighteenth century writers of Irish origin included Oliver Goldsmith and Richard Brinsley Sheridan, though they {{spent most of their}} lives in England. The Anglo-Irish novel came to the fore in the nineteenth century, featuring such writers as Charles Kickham, William Carleton, and (in collaboration) Edith Somerville and Violet Florence Martin. The playwright and poet Oscar Wilde, noted for his epigrams, was born in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the stands}} have more {{traditional}} names, but {{have since been}} renamed because of sponsorship deals. The JCT600 Stand is the ground's main stand, and is <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> latter by fans, but {{is also known as}} the Sunwin stand owing to the former sponsor. The Kop, was the former standing area, and its name was derived, like at many stadia across the country, from the Battle of Spion Kop. The East Stand, sponsored by Northern Commercials, is also named the Midland Road stand, because of the road {{on that side of the}} ground. The TL Dallas Stand is also known as the Bradford end, because it is nearest to the city centre.|$|E

5|$|The Maryland herd, <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Assateague herd, {{is owned}} and {{managed by the}} National Park Service. The Maryland herd is one of very few free-ranging wild horse populations left in the United States. This, {{combined}} with its presence on a relatively small and naturally confined area, has made it ideal for scientific study. Since the late 1970s, scientists have used the herd to conduct studies on feral horse behavior, social structure, ecology, remote contraceptive delivery and pregnancy testing, {{and the effects of}} human intervention on other wild animal populations. There are few other wildlife populations of any species worldwide that have been studied in as much detail over as long a period as the Maryland herd of Chincoteague ponies.|$|E
5|$|The Sautrāntika school held {{a form of}} phenomenalism {{that saw}} the world as imperceptible. It held that {{external}} objects exist only as a support for cognition, which can only apprehend mental representations. This influenced the later Yogacara school of Mahayana Buddhism. The Yogācāra school is <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> mind-only school because of its internalist stance that consciousness is the ultimate existing reality. The works of Vasubandhu have often been interpreted as arguing for some form of Idealism. Vasubandhu uses the dream argument and a mereological refutation of atomism to attack the reality of external objects {{as anything other than}} mental entities. Scholarly interpretations of Vasubandhu's philosophy vary widely, and include phenomenalism, neutral monism and realist phenomenology.|$|E
5|$|Anspach's {{backing of}} Suys' {{proposal}} was a calculated decision, {{as he had}} radical plans to transform the city. Anspach saw the proposal as an unexpected boon, as it allowed him to accomplish several of his goals at once. It had long been his ambition to transform the impoverished lower city into a centre of business and commerce, suitable for a modern capital (Belgium had declared its independence in 1830, with Brussels its capital). He wanted to attract the middle class, most of whom had left the dingy downtown for the cleaner suburbs, including the Leopold Quarter (now <b>often</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> European quarter) and Avenue Louise, causing a large loss in tax revenue for the city. The elimination of the numerous alleys and dead-ends in the lower town in favour of a large, straight, wide, open-air boulevard, linking the two rapidly growing train stations, seemed both a necessity {{and an opportunity to}} beautify the city and improve both traffic circulation and hygiene.|$|E
