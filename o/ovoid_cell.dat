40|$|Abstract––This study {{examined}} the distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-immunoreactive neurons in the amygdaloid complex of the rat, with emphasis on the central nucleus. The monoclonal antibody M 35 raised against purified muscarinic acetylcholine receptor protein was used to visualize muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-immunoreactive cells. Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor immuno-reactivity was high in the central nucleus and low to moderate in all {{other regions of the}} amygdaloid complex. Within the central nucleus, the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-immunoreactive neurons were found predominantly in the lateral subdivision. This region contained medium-sized neurons (largest diameter ranging from 10 to 15 µm), with a round or slightly <b>ovoid</b> <b>cell</b> shape. At the subcellular level, however, the labeled neurons revealed relatively few muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-immunoreactive postsynaptic densities. Immunofluorescent double-labeling demonstrated that nearly all of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-immunoreactive neurons (98. 6 %) in the central nucleus expressed abundant amounts of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, further substantiating the cholinoceptive character of these cells. In addition, the vast majority of these muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-immunoreactive neurons (94. 3 %) were GABAergic neurons.

40|$|International audienceSummary Medallion-like dermal dendrocyte hamartoma is a newly {{described}} and rare clinical and pathological entity. This congenital, round, erythematous and atrophic lesion in the thoracic area is histologically {{characterized by a}} CD 34 + dermal and hypodermal spindle-cell infiltration. We describe the clinical, histopathological, cytological and molecular features of three cases of dermal dendrocyte hamartoma. In all the cases, atrophic congenital dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) was the first histological diagnosis. In one case, wide surgery had been performed {{on the basis of}} the clinical and histological presentation. The histological pattern was similar in all the cases: epidermal atrophy and a spindle to <b>ovoid</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation in the dermis and in the subcutaneous fat. Immunochemical staining for CD 34 and factor XIIIa was positive. Cytogenetic and molecular studies were performed; no chromosomal abnormality nor translocation t(17; 22) (q 22;q 13) was observed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis did not reveal the DFSP fusion gene COL 1 A 1 -PDGFB. We observed that the main diagnostic pitfall of medallion-like dermal dendrocyte hamartoma is atrophic congenital DFSP due to clinical and histological similarities. We emphasize that molecular studies to eliminate the t(17; 22) (q 22;q 13) translocation of DFSP may provide determinant elements for diagnosis in order to avoid unnecessary mutilating surgery...|$|E

These lineages together form a long-branched clade that branches within the cercozoan class Granofilosea (phylum Cercozoa), showing phylogenetic affinities with the genus Mesofila.

40|$|Despite {{their high}} {{abundance}} and their high {{importance for the}} oceanic matter flux, heterotrophic nanoflagellates are only poorly studied in the deep-sea regions. Studies on the choanoflagellate distribution during two deep-sea expeditions, to the South Atlantic (5038 m) and Antarctica (Weddell Sea, 2551 m), revealed the deepest records of choanoflagellates so far. A new species, (Lagenoeca antarctica) with a conspicuous spike structure on the theca is described from deep Antarctic waters. Lagenoeca antarctica sp. n. is a solitary unstalked free living salpingoecid-like choanoflagellate. The protoplast {{is surrounded by a}} typical theca with unique spikes only visible in SEM micrographs. The <b>ovoid</b> <b>cell</b> nearly fills the whole theca and ranges in size from 4 to 6 µm. The collar measures 2 - 3 µm and the flagellum 3 - 5 µm. A second species, Salpingoeca abyssalis sp. n., was isolated from the abyssal plain of the South Atlantic (5038 m depth). Floating and attached forms were observed. The protoplast ranges from to 2 to 4 µm in length and 1 to 2 µm in width. The collar is about the same length as the protoplast and the flagellum has 2 to 2. 5 × the length of the protoplast. Phylogenetic analyses based on a fragment of SSU rDNA revealed Salpingoeca abyssalis to cluster together with a marine isolate of Salpingoeca infusionum while Lagenoeca antarctica clusters separately from the other codonosigid and salpingoecid taxa.

40|$|The authors {{previously}} reported the sequential morphological {{changes at the}} site of carotid endarterectomy (CE) in cats using light and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The following problems remain unsolved; a) at the stage of restoration after CE, why do thrombi not increase at the site and why does cerebral embolism never occur? b) {{what is the nature of}} the amorphous material covering the CE site? c) what is the origin of new endothelial cells growing like islands far away from both ends of the CE? The present study was conducted to obtain some insight into these unsolved problems. The ultrastructural healing process of the endarterectomized carotid arterial wall was observed with a transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The authors found that the amorphous material covering the naked surface in the acute phase of CE consisted mainly of platelets. The platelets were loosely arranged on the luminal surface but were closely packed together in the deeper layer. In reparative phase, two kinds of cells could be recognized on the luminal surface of CE, namely, <b>ovoid</b> and flattened <b>cells.</b> Some of the <b>ovoid</b> <b>cells</b> were isolated from other cells. Most of the <b>ovoid</b> <b>cells</b> maintained contact with other cells by the cell membrane but without definite junctional structures. The rough endoplasmic reticulum (rERs) of these cells was remarkably enlarged and occupied most of the cell. There were many cells in the subendothelial space which resembled <b>ovoid</b> type <b>cells</b> but collagen fibrils were seldom recognized. In the third week after CE, the vessel surface was lined by two different cells as in the second week. However, the difference of intercellular organelles between the two types became minimal. In the deeper layer, there were many cells with myofilaments, dense bodies and basement membrane which had an appearance of modified smooth muscle cells, and the rER of the cells in the deeper layer developed more markedly than that of cells in the superficial one. In the mature phase, the luminal surface was covered with only flattened type cells. These cells satisfied a criterion of endothelial cells and had tight junctions. Beneath these cell layers, several layers of smooth muscle cell were seen although no elastic laminae was present. There were particular cells in the deeper layer of these muscle cells which possessed dense bodies and basement membrane but no intercellular filament. No collagen existed around these cells. These particular cells were neither fibroblasts nor smooth muscle cells and are more actually undifferentiated type cells. These findings suggested that undifferentiated cells, originating in the media (medial multipotential mesenchymal <b>cells)</b> became <b>ovoid</b> type <b>cells</b> during migration to the luminal surface, then differentiated to flattened type cells and finally matured to new endothelial cells...|$|R

The muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-immunoreactive neurons expressed moderate levels of protein kinase Cy, one of the likely intracellular mediators between muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and their elicited physiological response. The number and staining intensity of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-immunoreactive neurons in the central nucleus varied dramatically among rats. This individual variation correlated positively with the rat's expression of conditioned immobility and correlated negatively with active shock avoidance performance. These results suggest that the GABAergic/cholinoceptive neuronal elements in the central nucleus are involved in the expression of fear-induced behaviors.

40|$|Two {{types of}} Escherichia coli mutants {{tolerant}} to beta-lactam antibiotics were isolated. One is E. coli χ 2452, which showed a tolerant response against beta-lactam antibiotics when grown at 42 °C, {{and the others}} are the mutants C- 80 and C- 254, selected from mutagenized E. coli χ 1776 by cycles of exposure to ampicillin, cephaloridine, and starvation of the nutritionally required diaminopimelic acid. Beta-lactam antibiotics caused rapid loss of viability and lysis in cultures of χ 1776 or in χ 2452 grown at 32 °C. In contrast, the same antibiotics caused only a reversible inhibition of growth in mutants C- 80 and C- 254 or in cultures of χ 2452 grown at 42 °C. Beta-lactam antibiotics that show high affinity for penicillin-binding proteins 2 or 3 (mecillinam and cephalexin, respectively) induced similar morphological effects (<b>ovoid</b> <b>cell</b> formation and filament formation) in both parent and mutant strains. In contrast, beta-lactam antibiotics which have a high affinity for penicillin-binding protein 1 (e. g., cephaloridine or cefoxitin), which cause rapid lysis in the parental strains, caused cell elongation in the tolerant bacteria. In contrast to the parental cells, autolytic cell wall degradation was not triggered by beta-lactam treatment of χ 2452 cells grown at 42 °C or in mutants C- 80 and C- 254. The total autolytic activity of mutants C- 80 and C- 254 was less than 30 % that of the parent strain.

40|$|We {{examined}} {{several aspects}} of cell division regulation in Escherichia coli which have been thought {{to be controlled by}} cyclic AMP (cAMP) and its receptor protein (CAP). Mutants lacking adenyl cyclase (cya) or CAP (crp) were rod shaped, not spherical, during exponential growth in LB broth or glucose-Casamino Acids medium, and lateral wall elongation was normal; in broth, stationary-phase cells became <b>ovoid.</b> <b>Cell</b> mass was smaller for the mutants than for the wild type, but it remained appropriate for their slower growth rate and thus probably does not reflect early (uncontrolled) septation. The slow growth did not seem to reflect a gross metabolic disorder, since the mutants gave a normal yield on limiting glucose; surprisingly, however, the cya mutant (unlike crp) was unable to grow anaerobically on glucose, suggesting a role for cAMP (but not for CAP) in the expression of some fermentation enzyme. Both cya and crp mutants are known to be resistant to mecillinam, an antibiotic which inhibits penicillin-binding protein 2 (involved in lateral wall elongation) and also affects septation. This resistance does not reflect a lack of PBP 2. Furthermore, it was not simply the result of slow growth and small cell mass, since small wild-type cells growing in acetate remained sensitive. The cAMP-CAP complex may regulate the synthesis of some link between PBP 2 and the septation apparatus. The ftsZ gene, coding for a cell division protein, was expressed at a higher level in the absence of cAMP, as measured with an ftsZ::lacZ fusion, but the amount of protein per cell, shown by others to be invariable over a 10 -fold range of cell mass, was independent of cAMP, suggesting that ftsZ expression is not regulated by the cAMP-CAP complex...|$|E
