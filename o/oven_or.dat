50|$|Slow cookers {{are less}} {{dangerous}} than <b>ovens</b> <b>or</b> stove tops {{due to their}} lower operating temperatures and closed lids. However, they still contain {{a large amount of}} foods and liquids at temperatures close to boiling, and they can cause serious scalds if spilled.|$|R
25|$|Barbecuing {{encompasses}} {{four or five}} distinct {{types of}} cooking techniques. The original technique is cooking using smoke at low temperatures—usually around 240–280°F or 115–145°C—and significantly longer cooking times (several hours), known as smoking. Another technique, known as baking, used a masonry <b>oven</b> <b>or</b> baking oven that uses convection to cook meats and starches with moderate temperatures for an average cooking time of about an hour. Braising combines direct, dry heat charbroiling on a ribbed surface with a broth-filled pot for moist heat. Using this technique, cooking occurs at various speeds, starting fast, slowing down, then speeding up again, lasting for a few hours.|$|E
25|$|Food is {{prepared}} {{as if for}} an <b>oven</b> <b>or</b> stove top. However, because food cooks faster when it is in smaller pieces, food placed inside a solar cooker is usually cut into smaller pieces than it might otherwise be. For example, potatoes are usually cut into bite-sized pieces rather than roasted whole. For very simple cooking, such as melting butter or cheese, a lid may not be needed and the food may be placed on an uncovered tray or in a bowl. If several foods are to be cooked separately, then they are placed in different containers.|$|E
25|$|The lower {{temperature}} of cooking (the boiling point of water) {{is a significant}} safety benefit compared to baking in the <b>oven</b> <b>or</b> frying, because it eliminates the formation of tars and char, which are carcinogenic. Microwave radiation also penetrates deeper than direct heat, so that the food is heated by its own internal water content. In contrast, direct heat can burn the surface while the inside is still cold. Pre-heating the food in a microwave oven before putting it into the grill or pan reduces {{the time needed to}} heat up the food and reduces the formation of carcinogenic char. Unlike frying and baking, microwaving does not produce acrylamide in potatoes, however unlike deep-frying, it is of only limited effectiveness in reducing glycoalkaloid (i.e. solanine) levels. Acrylamide has been found in other microwaved products like popcorn.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} {{of hundreds of}} pre-Hispanic <b>ovens</b> <b>or</b> furnace stoves, the infinity of stone tools and thousands of rock engraved images commonly known as petroglyphs, evidence the lengthy and important socio economical and ritual development of native groups that exploited and maintained an environmental equilibrium in the region up to the Spaniards' arrival.|$|R
40|$|Tests show {{radiative}} cooler {{consisting of}} several thin reflective shields {{with a slight}} angle between them redirects flow of heat very effectively.

5000|$|An <b>oven</b> glove, <b>or</b> <b>oven</b> mitt, is an {{insulated}} glove or mitten usually worn in {{the kitchen}} to easily protect the wearer's hand from hot objects such as ovens, stoves, cookware, etc. They are similar to, but different from, pot-holders.|$|R
25|$|Cells from bone marrow, blood, amniotic fluid, cord blood, tumor, and tissues (including skin, {{umbilical}} cord, chorionic villi, liver, {{and many}} other organs) can be cultured using standard cell culture techniques {{in order to increase}} their number. A mitotic inhibitor (colchicine, colcemid) is then added to the culture. This stops cell division at mitosis which allows an increased yield of mitotic cells for analysis. The cells are then centrifuged and media and mitotic inhibitor are removed, and replaced with a hypotonic solution. This causes the white blood cells or fibroblasts to swell so that the chromosomes will spread when added to a slide as well as lyses the red blood cells. After the cells have been allowed to sit in hypotonic solution, Carnoy's fixative (3:1 methanol to glacial acetic acid) is added. This kills the cells and hardens the nuclei of the remaining white blood cells. The cells are generally fixed repeatedly to remove any debris or remaining red blood cells. The cell suspension is then dropped onto specimen slides. After aging the slides in an <b>oven</b> <b>or</b> waiting a few days they are ready for banding and analysis.|$|E
25|$|All cavity {{magnetrons}} {{consist of}} a heated cathode placed at a high (continuous or pulsed) negative potential created by a high-voltage, direct-current power supply. The cathode {{is placed in the}} center of an evacuated, lobed, circular chamber. A magnetic field parallel to the filament is imposed by a permanent magnet. The magnetic field causes the electrons, attracted to the (relatively) positive outer part of the chamber, to spiral outward in a circular path, a consequence of the Lorentz force. Spaced around the rim of the chamber are cylindrical cavities. Slots are cut {{along the length of the}} cavities that open into the central, common cavity space. As electrons sweep past these slots, they induce a high-frequency radio field in each resonant cavity, which in turn causes the electrons to bunch into groups. (This principle of cavity resonator is very similar to blowing a stream of air across the open top of a glass pop bottle.) A portion of the radio frequency energy is extracted by a short antenna that is connected to a waveguide (a metal tube, usually of rectangular cross section). The waveguide directs the extracted RF energy to the load, which may be a cooking chamber in a microwave <b>oven</b> <b>or</b> a high-gain antenna in the case of radar.|$|E
500|$|Imbrices and tegulae {{were first}} {{made by the}} Greeks. [...] Like bricks, they were formed of wet clay in a four-sided mould, often shaped {{with a piece of}} wire, and then baked in an <b>oven</b> <b>or</b> kiln. [...] More {{sophisticated}} moulds were developed over time.|$|E

500|$|The {{technique}} of reborning a play doll typically involves {{a number of}} steps. To begin the doll is taken apart and factory paint is removed. Then a blue color wash may be applied to {{give the appearance of}} realistic baby skin undertones. For dolls with an awake appearance eyes must be replaced. The outer layer of the vinyl doll is given its skin tone by adding dozens of layers of flesh colored paint. If heat set paints are used, the doll parts must be heat set by baking them inside an <b>oven</b> <b>or</b> by using a heatgun after each layer of paint is applied. Lighter skin tone dolls can take 15 to 30 layers. The effects of the blue color wash combined with the outside layers of paint creates the appearance of veins, and gives the doll its newborn mottled look. Manicured nails and opening of the nose holes are other details that are added during this process. [...] There are air dry paints now available to reborn artists, sold under several brand names. [...] Many feel that repeated baking of vinyl can cause it to break down over time. [...] In addition, there are fumes and chemicals released during the heating process.|$|E
500|$|The late Roman army {{contained}} {{a significant number}} of heavily armoured cavalry called cataphractarii (from the Greek kataphraktos, meaning [...] "covered all over"). They were covered from neck to foot by a combination of scale and/or lamellar armour for the torso and laminated defences for the limbs (see manica), and their horses were often armoured also. Cataphracts carried a long, heavy lance called a contus, c. [...] long, that was held in both hands. Some also carried bows. The central tactic of cataphracts was the shock charge, which aimed to break the enemy line by concentrating overwhelming force on a defined section of it. A type of cataphract called a clibanarius also appears in the 4th-century record. This term may be derived from Greek klibanos (a bread <b>oven)</b> <b>or</b> from a Persian word. It is likely that clibanarius is simply an alternative term to cataphract, or {{it may have been a}} special type of cataphract. This type of cavalry had been developed by the Iranian horse-based nomadic tribes of the Eurasian steppes from the 6th century BC onwards: the Scythians and their kinsmen the Sarmatians. The type was adopted by the Parthians in the 1st century BC and later by the Romans, who needed it to counter Parthians in the East and the Sarmatians along the Danube. The first regiment of Roman cataphracts to appear in the archaeological record is the ala I Gallorum et Pannoniorum cataphractaria, attested in Pannonia in the early 2nd century. Although Roman cataphracts were not new, they were far more numerous in the late army, with most regiments stationed in the East. However, it should be noted that several of the regiments placed in the Eastern army had Gaulish names, indicating an ultimately Western origin.|$|E
