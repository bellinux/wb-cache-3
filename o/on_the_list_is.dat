5|$|With Simmons' help, Johnson {{discovers that}} the Watchdogs have hacked S.H.I.E.L.D.'s list using {{tracking}} wristwatches given to all registered Inhumans. The next Inhuman <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>is</b> J.T. James, an Inhuman with explosive abilities who {{spent time with}} Johnson {{under the influence of}} the parasitic Inhuman Hive. Johnson and Simmons remove James's wristwatch, but he betrays them to the Watchdogs with the promise that they would kill him once he helped destroy the other Inhumans—James hates himself and his Inhuman identity. Before they can investigate the Darkhold, Coulson and Mack are alerted to James's wristwatch being removed, and arrive to help Johnson and Simmons fight off the Watchdogs and arrest James.|$|E

Commercial and industrial development is represented by the Old Iron Works at Mells and various market crosses. The most recent site <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>is</b> a World War II bombing decoy complex and anti-aircraft obstructions, which were built in 1940, on Black Down, the highest point of the Mendip Hills.

25|$|The risk {{of being}} {{left behind by the}} boat can be {{controlled}} by logging divers {{into and out of the}} water.

25|$|Roy's Top Ten – Roy Bellamy {{performs}} {{this list}} {{on a regular}} basis, and the humor of the segment is multi-faceted. Part of it is derived from Bellamy's sometime mangling of the delivery, part is the often uproarious laughter from Stugotz, but the underlying, veiled theme is that nine of the ten <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>is</b> Afrocentric in nature, and the number one answer is always Caucasian in nature. Written by Roy and producer Mike Ryan, and previously former producer and co-host Marc Hochman, the list is always subject to being misconstrued by a casual listener as racist, but the show's (and Le Batard's) racial color-blindness allows {{for a lot of}} latitude in this regard.|$|E
25|$|Before 2005, donor lungs {{within the}} United States were {{allocated}} by the United Network for Organ Sharing on a first-come, first-served basis to patients on the transplant list. This {{was replaced by}} the current system, in which prospective lung recipients of age of 12 and older are assigned a lung allocation score or LAS, which takes into account various measures of the patient's health. The new system allocates donated lungs according to the immediacy of need rather than how long a patient has been on the transplant list. Patients who are under the age of 12 are still given priority based on how long they have been on the transplant waitlist. The length of time spent <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> <b>is</b> also the deciding factor when multiple patients have the same lung allocation score.|$|E
