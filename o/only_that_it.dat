In the House of Commons Sir William Davidson called for a formal protest, because Irish Oak had not warned the convoy, and Douglas Lloyd Savory called for an end of coal exports to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Frears had {{a clause}} in his {{contract}} {{that allowed him}} to direct any sequels. The success of The Deal prompted the production team to consider a new film—possibly surrounding Britain's commitment to the war in Iraq. In 2004, production was announced that the first follow-up would be produced for a theatrical film release in 2006, The Queen; that dramatises the weeks following the death of Princess Diana on 31 August 1997. Langan described the film as not being a direct sequel, <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> reunited the same creative team.|$|E

50|$|The Church's role {{in history}} was {{admitted}} to be significant, but <b>only</b> in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was used to strengthen the oppressing classes by teaching the masses to be docile.

5|$|Owing to {{its strong}} {{relation}} with Indonesia, the Philippines initially was cold on the issue. In fact, not <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> denied José Ramos-Horta entry in 1997 (when {{he was supposed}} to give a lecture to the University of the Philippines Diliman), then President-Fidel V. Ramos even included him in the immigration blacklist.|$|E
5|$|Augustine built {{a church}} at his {{foundation}} of Sts Peter and Paul Abbey at Canterbury, later renamed St Augustine's Abbey. This church was destroyed after the Norman Conquest {{to make way}} for a new abbey church. The mission also established Augustine's cathedral at Canterbury, which became Christ Church Priory. This church has not survived, and it is unclear if the church that was destroyed in 1067 and described by the medieval writer Eadmer as Augustine's church, was built by Augustine. Another medieval chronicler, Florence of Worcester, claimed that the priory was destroyed in 1011, and Eadmer himself had contradictory stories about the events of 1011, in one place claiming that the church was destroyed by fire and in another claiming <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was looted. A cathedral was also established in Rochester; although the building was destroyed in 676, the bishopric continued in existence. Other church buildings were erected by the missionaries in London, York, and possibly Lincoln, although none of them survive.|$|E

In his message he agreed to leave the division's heavy equipment in the Middle East, and requested <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> travel with items necessary to quickly re-enter combat in the South West Pacific. No further debate took place, and on 15 December Churchill informed Curtin that shipping would be made available in late January to transport the division and a small portion of its equipment to Australia.|$|E

25|$|The Leningrad Codex, {{which dates}} to {{approximately}} {{the same time as}} the Aleppo codex, has been claimed by Paul E. Kahle to be a product of the ben Asher scriptorium. However, its colophon says <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was corrected from manuscripts written by ben Asher; there is no evidence that ben Asher himself ever saw it. However, the same holds true for the Aleppo Codex, which was apparently not vocalized by ben Asher himself, although a later colophon, which was added to the manuscript after his death, attributes the vocalization to him.|$|E
25|$|Edmund takes Fanny back to Mansfield Park {{along with}} Susan. A repentant Sir Thomas now realises that Fanny {{was right to}} reject Henry's {{proposal}} all-along, and now regards her as his own daughter. During an emotional meeting with Mary Crawford, Edmund discovers that Mary does not condemn Henry and Maria's adultery, and regrets <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was discovered. Her view is to cover it up, and even places blame on Fanny for failing to accept Henry right away. Edmund is devastated to discover her true principles (or lack thereof). He breaks off the relationship and returns to Mansfield Park.|$|E

Garvin made arrangements for the skull to be examined at Hewlett-Packard's crystal laboratories in Santa Clara, California, where it was subjected to several tests. The labs determined <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not a composite as Dorland had supposed, but that it was fashioned from a single crystal of quartz. The laboratory test also established that the lower jaw had been fashioned from the same left-handed growing crystal as the rest of the skull. No investigation was made by Hewlett-Packard as to its method of manufacture or dating.|$|E

25|$|Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Qantas {{expressed}} an interest in buying Air New Zealand, Ansett employees planned a staff buy-out, and both SIA and Air New Zealand looked at buying News Limited's 50% share of Ansett. In March 1999 SIA made a formal offer of A$500 million for a half share. Given SIA's industry-leading status, ability to fund Ansett's re-equipment and expansion and global marketing network, industry observers were enthusiastic about the move. However, as part of its original deal to buy TNT's half of Ansett, Air New Zealand had a pre-emptive right to News Limited's half, provided <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> matched or bettered other offers.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{scholars}} differ as to {{the exact}} geographical position of Mount Sinai, and the same has long been true of scholars of Judaism. The Elijah narrative appears to suggest that when it was written, the location of Horeb was still known with some certainty, as Elijah is described as travelling to Horeb on one occasion, {{but there are no}} later biblical references to it that suggest the location remained known; Josephus only specifies that it was within Arabia Petraea (a Roman Province encompassing modern Jordan, southern modern Syria, the Sinai Peninsula and northwestern Saudi Arabia with its capital in Petra), and the Pauline Epistles are even more vague, specifying <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was in Arabia, which covers most of the south-western Middle east.|$|E
25|$|Not much {{is known}} about the ancient Celtic lyre, <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was used by Celtic bards since the 8th century BC and that it was later well known in Rome, where it was called lyra. Its {{resonator}} was made from wood, while only few components were made from bones. The instrument's strings were made from animal intestine. The Gauls and other Celtic peoples regarded the crwth as a symbol of their independent musical culture, although they had probably received it from the Ancient Greeks. The Goths invoked their tribal gods with prayers and chants, which they accompanied by lyre play. By the time of the Barbarian Invasions in the 5th century AD the lyre had become the most important stringed instrument of the Germanic tribes and was a six-stringed wooden lyre with hollow ledger arms and wooden vortices in the ledger rod. The original Celtic lyre however came with different numbers of strings, as the Lyre of Paule, which is depicted on a statue from Côtes d'Armor in Brittany, apparently had seven strings.|$|E
