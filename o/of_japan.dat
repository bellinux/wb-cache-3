50|$|In 1990 Africa {{accounted}} for just over 1% <b>of</b> <b>Japans</b> imports and for just over 1% <b>of</b> its exports. <b>Japans</b> largest trading partner in Africa in 1990 was South Africa, which {{accounted for}} 30% <b>of</b> <b>Japans</b> exports to Africa and 50% <b>of</b> <b>Japans</b> imports from the region. Because of trading sanctions imposed on South Africa by the United States and other countries, Japan emerged as South Africas largest trading partner during the 1980s. This position proved embarrassing to Japan and led it to downgrade some diplomatic and economic relations with the country. Despite the fact that South Africa remained Japans largest trading partner in the region, both exports and imports in 1988 had declined by more than one-third from their value in 1980. With the end of Apartheid and normalization of international relations of South Africa in 1994 Japans special role ended.|$|R
