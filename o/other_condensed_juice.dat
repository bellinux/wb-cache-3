It is not clear if EDC has a special function or it just acts under optimal reaction conditions (neutral pH, medium ionic force, low temperature, longer stability in solution as compared to <b>other</b> <b>condensing</b> agents used in the study). EDC variation has been performed and it was observed that while the reaction rate varied with the EDC concentration, after 100 h of the reaction time all the products achieved the same final length. We would suggest that EDC is specific to chosen model system but only due to its maximum reactivity under optimal reaction conditions and not because of its involvement in the later reaction stages.|$|R
