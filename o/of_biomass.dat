5|$|A {{keystone}} species is {{a species that}} is connected to a disproportionately large number of other species in the food-web. Keystone species have lower levels <b>of</b> <b>biomass</b> in the trophic pyramid relative {{to the importance of}} their role. The many connections that a {{keystone species}} holds means that it maintains the organization and structure of entire communities. The loss of a keystone species results in a range of dramatic cascading effects that alters trophic dynamics, other food web connections, and can cause the extinction of other species.|$|E
5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully mature {{technology}} which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One of the problems <b>of</b> <b>biomass</b> is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E

5|$|A Japanese {{field study}} found that S.spraguei was the {{dominant}} fungus in a 21-year-old stand of Korean Pine, {{both in terms of}} ectomycorrhizae (measured as percentage <b>of</b> <b>biomass</b> present in soil samples) and by fruit body production (comprising over 90% of dry weight of total fruit bodies collected of all species). The production of S.spraguei fruit bodies averaged about one per square meter, without much variance during the four-year study period. The mushrooms appeared mostly from August to November, tended to grow in clumps, and the spatial distribution of clumps was random—the location of the clumps was not correlatable with appearances in previous years. The density of mushrooms along a forest road was higher than average, suggesting a preference for disturbed habitat. The results also suggested that S.spraguei prefers to produce fruit bodies in areas with low litter accumulation, a finding corroborated in a later publication. This study also determined that the fungus propagates mainly by vegetative growth (extension of underground mycelia), rather than by colonization of spores.|$|E
5|$|The {{biosphere}} is {{the part}} of Earth's outer shell– including land, surface rocks, water, air and the atmosphere– within which life occurs, and which biotic processes in turn alter or transform. From the broadest geophysiological point of view, the biosphere is the global ecological system integrating all living beings and their relationships, including their interaction with the elements of the lithosphere (rocks), hydrosphere (water), and atmosphere (air). The entire Earth contains over 75billion tons (150 trillion pounds or about 6.8×1013kilograms) <b>of</b> <b>biomass</b> (life), which lives within various environments within the biosphere.) and 455billion kg (between 845billion and 975billion lb, or about 423million–488million short tons). The total biomass of all kinds on earth is estimated to be in excess of 6.8x1013kg (75billion short tons). By these calculations, the portion of total biomass accounted for by humans would be very roughly 0.6%.|$|E
5|$|The {{life-cycle}} of the phumdis {{has generally}} been subject to seasonal variation. During the monsoon season when the water level is high, the phumdis float, but during the dry season, as the water level falls, the phumdis touch the lake bed and absorb nutrients from it. When the wet season returns, they again float, and the biomass, which has enough nutrients stored in the plants' roots, survives. However, the contemporary situation, with high water levels in the lake throughout the year, has meant {{that the process of}} 'feeding' on lakebottom nutrients has been seriously disturbed, resulting in a loss <b>of</b> <b>biomass</b> and a thinning of the islands each year. In January 1999, it was reported that a large section of phumdi in the north of the park had shattered into pieces and drifted away from the park area, threatening the habitat of the sangai.|$|E
30|$|Figure  11 c {{shows that}} the growth curves <b>of</b> {{suspended}} <b>biomass</b> varied with time. One indicator <b>of</b> the increased <b>biomass</b> growth was the concentration <b>of</b> suspended <b>biomass</b> in the effluent. The concentration <b>of</b> initial suspended <b>biomass</b> was set at 4.8  mg VSS L− 1 that was experimentally determined {{at the start of}} continuous-flow column test. In the beginning of the column test, the concentration <b>of</b> suspended <b>biomass</b> dropped abruptly and then started to increase with time due to the dilute-in characteristics (Gaudy and Gaudy 1980). The general trend of the effluent for suspended biomass concentration in model prediction was similar to the experimental results obtained from the column test. The model-predicted and experimental results show that there was no significant degradation of 2 -CP by suspended biomass for the first 5  days. The growth rate <b>of</b> suspended <b>biomass</b> rapidly increased at a transient-state condition from 5 to 27  days. At this period, the suspended biomass vigorously degraded 2 -CP. Since the amount of 2 -CP available during bioregeneration was higher than after bioregeneration of activated carbon, the growth rate <b>of</b> suspended <b>biomass</b> during this period should have been higher than that at the steady-state level. The growth curve <b>of</b> suspended <b>biomass</b> showed a peak at 27  days during bioregeneration. The concentration <b>of</b> suspended <b>biomass</b> in effluent was approximately 25.3  mg VSS L− 1 at the steady state.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the effect of variation of the moisture content <b>of</b> forest <b>biomass</b> residues on a supply chain strategy, a simulation was performed using integrated biomass supply analysis and logistics modeling. A simple supply chain strategy was chosen and applied for Miramichi and Plaster Rock, two different regions in New Brunswick, Canada. These regions are selected based on three criteria: annual potential harvest <b>of</b> forest <b>biomass</b> residues, annual production potential of electric and thermal energy and distribution of transportation zones. The moisture content <b>of</b> forest <b>biomass</b> residues was dependant on the weather conditions of the selected regions. The {{results show that the}} moisture content <b>of</b> the <b>biomass</b> in Plaster Rock was more stable but higher than the biomass in the Miramichi region. In simulating the supply chain strategy, particular attention is given to harvest, baling, storage and transportation <b>of</b> the <b>biomass.</b> The simulation results show that, during harvest and baling <b>of</b> the <b>biomass,</b> the moisture content affects the dry matter loss and, as a consequence, the customer and ownership costs of the operations.

5|$|The {{shape and}} {{energy of the}} land is {{significantly}} affected by gravitational forces. On a large scale, the distribution of gravitational forces on the earth is uneven and influences the shape and movement of tectonic plates as well as influencing geomorphic processes such as orogeny and erosion. These forces govern many of the geophysical properties and distributions of ecological biomes across the Earth. On the organismal scale, gravitational forces provide directional cues for plant and fungal growth (gravitropism), orientation cues for animal migrations, and influence the biomechanics and size of animals. Ecological traits, such as allocation <b>of</b> <b>biomass</b> in trees during growth are subject to mechanical failure as gravitational forces influence the position and structure of branches and leaves. The cardiovascular systems of animals are functionally adapted to overcome pressure and gravitational forces that change according to the features of organisms (e.g., height, size, shape), their behaviour (e.g., diving, running, flying), and the habitat occupied (e.g., water, hot deserts, cold tundra).|$|E
