5|$|Moreover, {{numerous}} scholars {{think that}} tefillin also play an apotropaic function. For instance, Yehudah B. Cohn {{argues that the}} tefillin should be perceived as an invented tradition aimed at counteracting {{the popularity of the}} Greek amulets with an “original” Jewish one. In fact, some more anthropologically inclined scholars like Joshua Trachtenberg, considered every ornament worn on the body (whatever its declared function) as initially serving the purpose of an amulet. In addition to this the early Rabbinic sources furnish more or less explicit examples of the apotropaic qualities of tefillin. For instance, Bamidbar R. 12:3 presents tefillin as capable of defeating “a thousand demons” emerging on “the left side,” rabbis Yohanan and Nahman used their sets to repel the fiends inhabiting privies in BT Berakhot 23a-b, whereas Elisha the Winged, who was scrupulous in performing this mitzvah, was miraculously saved from the Roman persecution in BT Shabbat 49a. Also, tefillin are believed to possess life-lengthening qualities, as suggested in BT Menahot 36b, 44a-b and in BT Shabbat 13a-b and they are often listed in <b>one</b> <b>breath</b> among various items which are considered amuletic in nature, {{as is the case in}} M Kelim 23:1, M Eruvin 10:1 or BT Eruvin 96b-97a.|$|E

25|$|Standard {{swimming}} {{calls for}} <b>one</b> <b>breath</b> every third arm recovery or every 1.5 cycles, alternating the sides for breathing. Some swimmers instead {{take a breath}} every cycle, i.e., every second arm recovery, breathing always to the same side. Most competition swimmers will breathe every other stroke, or once a cycle, to a preferred side. However some swimmers can breathe comfortably to both sides. Sprinters will often breathe a predetermined number of times in an entire race. Elite sprinters will breathe once or even no times during a fifty-metre race. For a one hundred metre race sprinters will often breathe every four strokes, once every two cycles, or will start with every four strokes and finish with every two strokes. In water polo and water rescue, the head is often {{kept out of the}} water completely for better visibility and easier breathing, at the price of a much steeper body position and higher drag.|$|E

2500|$|German gas {{attacks were}} made at night or in the early morning, when the wind was {{favourable}} and darkness {{made it difficult for}} the defenders to see the gas cloud. Phosgene made the gas cloud more poisonous and the Germans tried to increase the concentration of the gas by discharging it quickly, though this reduced the duration of the attack. The gas was found to be a mixture of about [...] chlorine and [...] phosgene. The slow dispersal of cloud gas from depressions and trenches, made it difficult for the defenders to know when the gas discharge had ended. British studies concluded that the Germans had tried to surprise the troops with a lethal amount of gas, before they could get their helmets on. Soldiers wearing helmets were safe but <b>one</b> <b>breath</b> of concentrated gas would cause coughing and gasping, which made it very difficult to adjust the helmet and troops slow to don their helmets could be killed. On 19 December, some troops well behind the front line were affected and helmets were worn at Vlamertinghe, about [...] behind the front line. The British concluded that the speed of the gas cloud reduced casualties, even though the gas helmets in use had not been treated specifically to resist phosgene.|$|E

2500|$|In {{creating}} the voice for GLaDOS, voice actress Ellen McLain attempted {{to sound like}} a computer. This was accomplished by her emulating a computer-generated voice that the Valve team played for her and her adding emotion to lines when appropriate. While designing her voice, Swift commented that it was difficult to write some of the lines for GLaDOS, describing McLain as [...] "super likable", and that they should write for that. She also performed the song [...] "Still Alive", which features GLaDOS singing to the effect that she is still alive by the end of Portal. This song was written by Jonathan Coulton, who was approached by the team and asked if he would want to write a song for them. He later decided {{that it would be a}} good idea to do a song featuring one of the voices from the game that would tie up the story at the end. Swift stated that the team wanted the players to leave the game happy, leading to them implementing the song in the first place. Wolpaw and the other writers wrote down a list of things that would make people happy, which resulted in [...] "Still Alive". In discussing the difficulties in singing the song as GLaDOS, McLain listed one of the difficulties as breathing, because computers do not need to breathe. As a result, she had to sing the phrases in <b>one</b> <b>breath,</b> while attempting to keep a clean, even tone. Swift commented in an interview that one of the focuses of developing the game was for players to hear GLaDOS and hear her song. GLaDOS continues to be voiced by McLain in Portal 2, who worked with Valve every two weeks to record the majority of the dialogue for the game. The frequency of her voice sessions allowed Valve to experiment with GLaDOS's lines and how they came out within the final game. After finding that [...] "Still Alive" [...] was a large part of Portal's success, Valve included more music in Portal 2, including further involvement from Coulton. Coulton wrote a new song for the game's ending credits, [...] "Want You Gone", which is written from GLaDOS's viewpoint of wanting to rid herself of Chell. It is performed by McLain. The writers found they needed another character to play off of Portal 2's Cave Johnson during his recordings; instead of hiring a voice actor for a few lines, they economized by reusing McLain to play Caroline, Cave's assistant. This led naturally to providing a backstory for the creation of GLaDOS, who is revealed in-game to be Caroline who was put into GLaDOS. This later led the writers to develop a full story arc for GLaDOS where she would come to recall her past, learn from it to solve the dilemma and then subsequently delete it and reset herself.|$|E
