5|$|Archaeologists {{have not}} been able to recover enough of Kronans sculptures for a {{detailed}} reconstruction of the <b>ornamentation.</b> The mascarons (architectural facemasks) and putti (images of children) that were salvaged as of 2007 show considerable artistic quality according to Soop. A large sculpture of a warrior figure was found in 1987 and is an example of high-quality workmanship, possibly even a symbolic portrait of King Charles. Since nothing is known of the surrounding <b>ornamentation</b> and sculptures, the conclusion remains speculative.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, we {{describe}} the ultrastructural organisation of the spermatozoon of a Digenea Baccigerinae Pronoprymna ventricosa. This spermatozoon possesses the elements found in the others digeneans: two axonemes with 9 + " 1 " pattern, a mitochondrion, a nucleus, cortical microtubules and external <b>ornamentations.</b> However, this spermatozoon presents two particularities. The first {{is the presence of}} a single field of cortical microtubules disposed in the ventral side (mitochondrion side) of the spermatozoon. In the other digeneans, two fields of cortical microtubules are observed between the two axonemes. The second is the presence of external <b>ornamentations</b> not associated with cortical microtubules. These two points have, to our knowledge, never been described in another digenean. Moreover, a separation in two groups of the digenean spermatozoa is proposed in relation to the localisation of the external <b>ornamentations.</b> We propose to distinguish a first group exhibiting these elements in the proximal part of the spermatozoon and a second one with external <b>ornamentations</b> in a second part of the gamete...|$|R
5|$|Majungasaurus {{is perhaps}} most {{distinctive}} for its skull <b>ornamentation,</b> including the swollen and fused nasals and the frontal horn. Other ceratosaurs, including Carnotaurus, Rajasaurus, and Ceratosaurus itself bore crests on the head. These structures {{are likely to have}} played a role in intraspecific competition, although their exact function within that context is unknown. The hollow cavity inside the frontal horn of Majungasaurus would have weakened the structure and probably precluded its use in direct physical combat, although the horn may have served a display purpose. While there is variation in the <b>ornamentation</b> of Majungasaurus individuals, there is no evidence for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
5|$|More {{representatives of}} the genus are present in Asia. At least nine species have been {{recorded}} from mainland India, some of which also overlap C.cinnabarinums range in Indonesia, Taiwan, or Japan. Many of these species can be readily distinguished by macroscopic features. C.japonicum is pinkish orange and lacks a gelatinous outer layer, while both C.jiangii and C.junghuhnii are brown. However, others require microscopic features of spore shape and <b>ornamentation</b> for identification. Unlike the uniformly elongated spores of C.cinnabarinum, C.guizhouense possesses both elliptical and globose spores. C.pengii differs primarily {{in the pattern of}} <b>ornamentation</b> on its spore surface.|$|E

40|$|<b>Ornamentations</b> {{in music}} play a signicant {{role for the}} emo- tion which a {{performer}} or a composer aims to create. The automated identication of <b>ornamentations</b> enhances the understanding of music, {{which can be used}} as a feature for tasks such as performer identication or mood classication. Existing methods rely on a pre-processing step that performs note segmentation. We propose an alternative method by adapting the existing two-dimensional COSFIRE lter approach to one-dimension (1 D) for the automatic identication of <b>ornamentations</b> in monophonic folk songs. We construct a set of 1 D COSFIRE lters that are selective for the 12 notes of the Western music theory. The re- sponse of a 1 D COSFIRE lter is computed as the geometric mean of the dierences between the fundamental frequency values in a local neigh- bourhood and the preferred values at the corresponding positions. We apply the proposed 1 D COSFIRE lters to the pitch tracks of a song at every position along the entire signal, which in turn give response values in the range [0, 1]. The 1 D COSFIRE lters that we propose are eective to recognize meaningful musical information which can be transformed into symbolic representations and used for further analysis. We demon- strate the eectiveness of the proposed methodology in a new data set that we introduce, which comprises ve monophonic Cypriot folk tunes consisting of 428 <b>ornamentations.</b> The proposed method is eective for the detection and recognition of <b>ornamentations</b> in singing folk music...|$|R
40|$|Objective. This paper {{presents}} the results of a multiparametrical analysis of "Mongolian Long song", named Urtyn duu in Mongolian. This is a long and slow versified melody with multiple <b>ornamentations,</b> which are unknown in the western occidental singing. The laryngeal behaviour observed during certain <b>ornamentations</b> can be compared to compensatory gesture produced by patients after partial laryngectomy.

We try to know if the laryngeal movement observed during Long Song relates to a physiological production or extreme movements in the field of degree of freedom of the larynx. Method. The study includes: (1) a physiological analysis (videofiberoptic laryngeal data of the 61 <b>ornamentations</b> of a song produced by a famous Mongolian singer, Narantuya, and video recordings of the singer); (2) an acoustical analysis (fundamental frequency and intensity curves of the <b>ornamentations),</b> (3) analysis of videofiberoptic recordings of 3 patients after supra cricoid partial laryngectomy...|$|R

5|$|Expensive and {{elaborate}} <b>ornamentation</b> {{was an important}} part of a ship's appearance in the 1660s, even though it had been simplified since the early 17th century. Such <b>ornamentation</b> was believed to enhance the authority of absolute monarchs and to portray the ship as a symbol of martial prowess and royal authority. There are no contemporary illustrations of the <b>ornamentation</b> of Kronan, but according to common practice it was most lavish on the transom, the flat surface facing aft. There are two images of Kronan shown from the stern by two Danish artists. Both works were commissioned many years after the sinking to commemorate the Danish victory. Claus Møinichen's painting at Fredriksborg Palace from 1686 shows a transom dominated by two lions rampant holding up a huge royal crown. The background is blue with sculptures and ornaments in gold. Swedish art historian Hans Soop, who has previously studied the sculptures of Vasa, a prestige ship of Gustavus Adolphus's navy that sank only 20 minutes into her maiden voyage in Stockholm in 1628, has suggested that Møinichen may have intentionally exaggerated the size of the ship to enhance the Danish victory. A tapestry at Rosenborg Castle shows Kronan as a two-decker with a crown motif that is even larger than Møinichen's painting.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Sampson {{noted that}} earlier studies {{had found that}} the horns and frills of ceratopsians most likely had a {{function}} in intraspecific display and combat, and that these features would therefore have resulted from sexual selection for successful mating. Likewise, in 1997 Horner concluded that such <b>ornamentation</b> was used by males to establish dominance and that females would have preferred well-equipped males as their offspring would then inherit these traits, conferring a reproduction benefit. Dodson thought that in the Centrosaurinae in general the display value of the frill had been reduced compared to the nasal and supraorbital <b>ornamentation.</b> Sampson in 1995 rejected {{the possibility that the}} difference in skull <b>ornamentation</b> between Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus represented sexual dimorphism, for three reasons. Firstly, the extensive Einiosaurus bone beds did not contain any specimens with bosses, as would have been expected if one of the sexes had them. Secondly, Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus are found in strata of a different age. Thirdly, in a situation of sexual dimorphism usually only one of the sexes shows exaggerated secondary sexual characters. Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus however, each have developed a disctinct set of such traits.|$|E

These movements contrasted with the absence of cervico-scapular movement of the singer. The acoustic analysis showed: (1) for the "lyrical" vibrato: the fundamental frequency and the intensity were in-phase, with a moderate amplitude (1 to 3 semitones for the fundamental frequency, 4 to 6 dB for the intensity; 5 to 6 modulations/s); (2) for the "Mongolian" trill: the fundamental frequency and the intensity were in opposite phase, with an important amplitude (3. 5 to 4. 5 semitones for the fundamental frequency, 6 to 10 dB for the intensity; and 6 to 7 modulations/s) and acoustical indications of changes of laryngeal vibratory mechanisms. So in this multiparametrical study of Mongolian Long song with previously unpublished physiological data, we defined two <b>ornamentations</b> used by the singer in the same melody, corresponding to different laryngeal movements and different acoustic characteristics: "lyrical" vibrato and "Mongolian arytenoidian" trill...|$|R

5|$|Since embryos {{are unknown}} in cairanoolithid eggs, the {{identity}} of their parent is uncertain. They have long been considered to be eggs of titanosaurs or ornithopods (like Rhabdodon). However, numerous characteristics distinguish Cairanoolithus from sauropod eggs (oofamilies Megaloolithidae and Faveoloolithidae), even though they bear superficial similarities in size and shape. Cairanoolithuss columnar eggshell units are quite unlike the fan-shaped ones seen in Megaloolithus, Faveoloolithus, or Fusioolithus. Also, its subdued <b>ornamentation</b> contrasts strongly with the heavily sculpted eggshells of sauropod eggs, {{and it has a}} different pore system. Eggs of ornithopods (Spheroolithidae and Ovaloolithidae), on the other hand, show much closer similarity to cairanoolithids in <b>ornamentation</b> and pore system. However, ornithopod eggs are typically much smaller, and the crystal structure of their eggshell units is distinct.|$|E

5|$|The Jain Temple at Lakkundi marked an {{important}} step in the development of Western Chalukya outer wall <b>ornamentation,</b> and in the Muktesvara Temple at Chavudayyadanapura the artisans introduced a double curved projecting eave (chhajja), used centuries later in Vijayanagara temples. The Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi embodies a more mature development of the Chalukyan architecture in which the tower has a fully expressed ascending line of niches. The artisans used northern style spires and expressed it in a modified dravida outline. Miniature towers of both dravida and nagara types are used as <b>ornamentation</b> on the walls. With further development, the divisions between storeys on the superstructure became less marked, until they almost lost their individuality. This development is exemplified in the Dodda Basappa Temple at Dambal, where the original dravida structure can only be identified after reading out the ornamental encrustation that covers the surface of each storey.|$|E
