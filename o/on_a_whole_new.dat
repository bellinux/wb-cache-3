25|$|Hoveyda's rise {{to power}} {{involved}} many years of service within the ministry of foreign affairs, but this path took <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> approach once he joined the Board of Directors of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) in 1958 {{at the behest of}} his patron Abdullah Entezam, who had by then assumed a high ranking position at the company. As managing director and special assistant to Entezam, Hoveyda used his experiences in the West to transform management-worker relations. As an example, he introduced innovative methods by which workers filed grievances in regard to any aspect of the working environment they deemed unsatisfactory, and helped to figuratively enmesh the roles of management and the labourers into a collective entity. One way he went about doing this was by eating many of his meals alongside wage labourers in the cafeteria. Although he advocated the emulation of Western models to improve overall productivity and worker relations, Hoveyda was very outspoken in favour of expelling foreign technicians and attracting indigenous sources of labour. It was during his tenure in which the NIOC's periodical, Kavosh (Exploration), was first published. What is unique about this magazine is that it was, initially, virtually void of any semblance of the growing cult of personality which surrounded the Shah.|$|E

[...] Though rumors of the album's third track, [...] "The KKK Took My Baby Away", being about Johnny stealing Joey's girlfriend have circulated {{in the music}} business, the song was actually written some time before Joey had reportedly found out about this. Joey's brother Mickey Leigh relates: [...] "The fluky connection between Johnny and the KKK raised a specter that keeps friends and fans speculating to this day. At the time, though, {{it had to be}} an unusual situation for him being that, as often happens with song lyrics, his words now took <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> meaning." [...] The following track, [...] "Don't Go", was described in Musician, Player, and Listener as [...] "Spector-ish", referring to the song's high production value through Phil Spector, the infamous producer of the band's previous record, End of the Century. According to the book, the lyrics detail [...] "an archivist's sense of young love by the book and how innocent rock 'n' roll is supposed to sound." [...] Everett True, author of Hey Ho Let's Go: The Story of the Ramones (2005), explains that the album's fifth track, [...] "You Sound Like You're Sick", is very bass incorporated, saying that it [...] "returns to the bassist's traditional institutionalised theme." [...] Side A ends with [...] "It's Not My Place (In the 9 to 5 World)", which was described by music critic David Fricke to be [...] "driven home" [...] by drummer Marky's [...] "feisty, Bo Diddley-style" [...] drum beat, and noted that it borrows the middle eight (of thirty-two-bar form) from The Who song [...] "Whiskey Man".|$|E

50|$|This Zostera {{grows in}} muddy and sandy shores only at and below spring tides. This plant is an {{important}} member of the coastal ecosystem in many areas because it helps to physically form the habitat and it {{plays a crucial role}} for many other species.

STYL KAR built a new, larger factory in 1967 and soon its most successful model, the 1300 (with Volkswagen air-cooled engine) was introduced. The company produced thousands of three-wheeler trucks, while in 1970 it developed a two-tonne four-wheel truck to replace the three-wheelers that were by that time becoming less appealing to the Greeks; this model, however, never reached production.
