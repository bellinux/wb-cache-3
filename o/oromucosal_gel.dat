40|$|A {{single dose}} of 40 μg/kg {{bodyweight}} (BW) of oromucosal detomidine gel was administered sublingually to 10 healthy Dutch Warmblood mares aged 7 ± 4 years (mean ± SD) and BW 580 ± 69 kg. Blood and urine {{samples were collected}} before and for 8 days following administration and evaluated qualitatively in an FEI Reference Laboratory and quantitatively in a research laboratory. Clinical effects were evaluated at baseline and for 24 h after administration. Sedation was determined using head height and scores of reaction to auditory and mixed auditory/sensory stimuli. Mechanical nociceptive thresholds (MNTs) were assessed using pressure algometry to evaluate analgesia. Heart rate (HR) was measured and ataxia scored. All horses were considered negative for detomidine in blood samples by 48 h post-administration and in urine by 60 h. These results indicated that a safe withdrawal time for detomidine <b>oromucosal</b> <b>gel</b> maybe 72 h following a single sublingual administration of 40 μg/kg BW. Decreases in HR and head height were maximal at 40 and 60 min post-administration, respectively. The maximal decrease in response to stimuli was observed at 100 min. Ataxia was maximal at 60 min. At 40 and 80 min MNTs were significantly increased compared to baseline. All parameters, except the MNTs of two locations, which were decreased, returned to baseline values within 24 h post-administration...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} effects of <b>oromucosal</b> {{detomidine}} <b>gel</b> administered sublingually to calves prior to disbudding, and to compare its efficacy with intravenously administered detomidine. Study design: Randomised, prospective clinical study. Animals: Twenty dairy calves aged 12. 4 ± 4. 4 days (mean ± SD), weight 50. 5 ± 9. 0 kg. Methods: Detomidine at 80 μg kg- 1 was administered to ten calves sublingually (GEL) and at 30 μg kg- 1 to ten control calves intravenously (IV). Meloxicam (0. 5 mg kg- 1) and  local anaesthetic (lidocaine 3 mg kg- 1) were administered before heat cauterization of horn buds. Heart rate (HR), body temperature and clinical sedation were monitored over   240 minutes. Blood was collected during the same period for drug concentration  analysis. Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated from the plasma detomidine  concentration-time data using non-compartmental methods.  Results: The maximum plasma detomidine concentration after GEL was 2. 1 ± 1. 2 ng  mL- 1 (mean ± SD) and the time of maximum concentration was 66. 0 ± 36. 9 minutes. The bioavailability of detomidine was approximately 34 % with GEL. Similar sedation  scores were reached in both groups after administration of detomidine, but maximal sedation was reached earlier in the IV group (10 minutes) than in the GEL group (40  minutes). HR was lower after IV than GEL from 5 to 10 minutes after administration. All animals were adequately sedated, {{and we were able to}} administer local anaesthetic without resistance to all of the calves before disbudding. Conclusions and clinical relevance: Oromucosally administered detomidine is an  effective sedative agent for calves prior to disbudding...|$|R

MethodsDetomidine at 80 μg kg− 1 was administered to ten calves sublingually (GEL) and at 30 μg kg− 1 to ten control calves IV (V. jugularis). Meloxicam (0. 5 mg kg− 1) and local anaesthetic (lidocaine 3 mg kg− 1) were administered before heat cauterization of horn buds. Heart rate (HR), body temperature and clinical sedation were monitored over 240 minutes. Blood was collected from the V. cephalica during the same period for drug concentration analysis. Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated from the plasma detomidine concentration-time data using non-compartmental methods. Statistical analyses compared routes of administration by Student’s t-test and linear mixed models as relevant. ResultsThe maximum plasma detomidine concentration after GEL was 2. 1 ± 1. 2 ng mL− 1 (mean ±SD) and the time of maximum concentration was 66. 0 ± 36. 9 minutes.
