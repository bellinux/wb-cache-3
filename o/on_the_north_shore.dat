The opening of the viaduct marked the final part of a $6,000,000 grade crossing elimination project on Staten Island, which eliminated thirty-four grade crossings on the north and south shores of Staten Island.|$|E

The ballpark is sponsored by PNC Financial Services, which purchased the naming rights in 1998. PNC Park features a natural grass playing surface and seats 38,362 people for baseball.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of the lake also gave a water frontage to many prominent institutions that were previously landlocked. The Royal Canberra Hospital was located on the Acton Peninsula between the West Lake and the West Basin <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>shore</b> until its demolition. Government House, the historic Blundell's Cottage—which was built over 50 years before construction of Canberra began—and the newly built Australian National University, on the southern and northern shores of the West Lake, both gained a waterfront.|$|E

5|$|Multiple eruptions of silica-rich {{rhyolite}} from 40,000 to 600 {{years ago}} built the Mono Craters. Black Point, today <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>shore</b> of Mono Lake, is a flattened volcanic cone of basaltic debris that formed {{under the surface}} of a much deeper Mono Lake about 13,300 years ago, during the most-recent glacial period. Several eruptive episodes from 1,600 to 270 years before present in Mono Lake formed Negit Island.

5|$|The SIRT {{discontinued}} passenger service <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Shore</b> Branch to Arlington and the South Beach Branch to Wentworth Avenue {{at midnight}} on March 31, 1953 because of city-operated bus competition; the South Beach Branch was abandoned shortly thereafter, while the North Shore Branch continued to carry freight. By 1955, the third rail {{on both of}} the lines were removed. On September 7, 1954, SIRT made an application to discontinue all passenger service on the Tottenville Branch on October 7, 1954. A large city subsidy allowed passenger service on the Tottenville Branch to continue.|$|E
5|$|The {{choice of}} route through Stjørdal {{remained}} a controversy. The river Stjørdalselva created a barrier {{just north of}} Hell, making it cheaper to build the line on the south shore of the river until Hegra. This would make the line bypass Stjørdalshalsen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>shore,</b> the largest town between Trondheim and Östersund. Despite massive local protests, Parliament ultimately chose the southern alternative. The added distance reduced Stjørdalshalsen's trade role while reducing railway revenue as the steam ships continued to run on the route, thus reducing the profitability of the line. Stjørdalselva Bridge was opened in 1902 when the Hell–Sunnan Line opened to Stjørdal.|$|E

5|$|The colonial {{administration}} {{wanted to}} expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade, and also because of their competition with Saint-Louis. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, {{who was in charge}} of Gorée, left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post. The tip of Diogue, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>shore,</b> was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted.|$|E
5|$|Buchanan next turned Virginia on Congress. Seeing {{what had}} {{happened}} to Cumberland, Lieutenant Joseph B. Smith, captain of Congress, ordered his ship grounded in shallow water. By this time, the James River Squadron, commanded by John Randolph Tucker, had arrived and joined Virginia in the attack on Congress. After an hour of unequal combat, the badly damaged Congress surrendered. While the surviving crewmen of Congress were being ferried off the ship, a Union battery <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>shore</b> opened fire on Virginia. In retaliation, Buchanan ordered Congress fired upon with hot shot, cannonballs heated red-hot. Congress caught fire and burned {{throughout the rest of the}} day. Near midnight, the flames reached her magazine and she exploded and sank, stern first. Personnel losses included 110 killed or missing and presumed drowned. Another 26 were wounded, of whom ten died within days.|$|E
5|$|Caspersen {{supported}} rowing, and {{was involved}} with the Princeton National Rowing Association (PNRA) and Princeton International Regatta Association (PIRA).

Located at the Mercer Lake Race Course—site of the 1988, 1992, 2004 and 2008 United States Olympic Rowing Team Trials—the facility is used for training, racing, camps, clinics and administration by Peddie, Lawrenceville, the Hun School, high schools in Mercer County, New Jersey, USRowing, the US National Team, and the Mercer Junior Rowing Club, as well as PNRA and PIRA.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} storm, many were {{relieved}} {{to have survived}} {{the worst of the}} Category4 hurricane; their complacency turned to apprehensiveness due to lack of information, as every radio station was out and there was no news available for several days. Because Iniki knocked out electrical power for most of the island, communities held parties to necessarily consume perishable food from unpowered refrigerators and freezers. Though food markets allowed those affected to take what they needed, many Kauai citizens insisted on paying. In addition, entertainers from all of Hawaii, including Graham Nash (who owns a home <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>shore</b> of Kauaʻi) and the Honolulu Symphony, provided free concerts to the victims.|$|E
5|$|In Stjørdal, {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} route. The river of Stjørdalselva creates a barrier {{just north of}} Hell, which made it cheaper to build the line on the south shore of the river to Hegra. However, the major population center was located at Stjørdalshalsen, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>shore</b> of the river. Locally, there were many protests against the line bypassing such a large town, {{but the cost of}} the bridge made Parliament choose the southern alternative. This gave residents in the town a considerably longer route to the train, since they had to cross the river to get access to the railway. This decreased the railway's ability to compete with the steam ships and thus the overall profitability of the line. With the arrival of the railway, transport to Trondheim became much easier than to Stjørdalshalsen and Levanger, helping Trondheim grow as a regional center.|$|E
5|$|In the 1860s {{during the}} American Civil War, housing for {{a battery of}} four field {{artillery}} pieces was constructed {{at the tip of}} the peninsula. It was used to defend a prison for Confederate soldiers on nearby Johnson's Island. Louis Zistel, a German immigrant, built two boats to transport the prisoners. In 1870, he began to ferry locals to the Cedar Point peninsula, which was regaining popularity as a summer picnic destination. Zistel opened a bathhouse <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>shore</b> of the peninsula and the same year built a beer garden with a small dance floor. He charged 25 cents per person to ride from Sandusky to Cedar Point on his boat, Young Reindeer. This marked the beginning of commercial tourism on the Cedar Point peninsula.|$|E

5|$|The Yalain {{appear to}} {{have been one of the}} three {{dominant}} polities in Postclassic central Petén, alongside the Itza and the Kowoj.

In the 17th century the Yalain capital was located at the site of that name <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> <b>shore</b> of Lake Macanché. At the time of Spanish contact the Yalain were allied with the Itza, an alliance cemented by intermarriage between the elites of both groups.
