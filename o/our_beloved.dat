25|$|The {{sandstone}} Memorial to the Dead {{was designed}} by the Old Newingtonian architect William Hardy Wilson and is now sited between the Centenary Hall and the Chapel. It was originally placed in a grove of trees {{to the north of}} the Founders Wing but was moved to its present location in the early 1960s to make way for the construction of the Centenary Hall which was opened in 1963. The memorial comprises a semi-circular wall and seat, with pillars surmounted by white stone urns at either end and a column with a sundial stands at the centre. The inscription on the wall reads: 1914 – To <b>Our</b> <b>Beloved</b> Dead – 1918 and the inscription on the sundial reads: Time dims not their sacrifice. The memorial was dedicated on 11 May 1922 by the Governor General of Australia and the Old Newingtonian poet Leslie Holdsworth Allen wrote a poem, To <b>our</b> <b>beloved</b> dead, in memory of the occasion.|$|E

I don't have to mask my emotion in front of a room full of so many dear friends. I am personally devastated by the loss of someone who has meant so much to me for so many years.

She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years. Simply put, Whitney would have wanted the music to go on and her family asked that we carry on.|$|E
