5|$|Instead, {{a system}} of {{multiple}} receiver antennas was adopted, each one located so that only a certain section of the sky was visible. Two horizontal receivers were mounted {{on either side of}} the fuselage and <b>only</b> <b>saw</b> reflections from the left or right, slightly overlapping in the middle. Two vertical receivers were mounted above and below the wing, seeing reflections above or below the aircraft.|$|E

He was given a one-race ban and a €50,000 fine for his role in the collision, forcing him to miss the Italian Grand Prix. He was replaced by the team's testing and reserve driver, Jérôme d'Ambrosio. Grosjean returned to the team for the next round in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|Offshore {{helicopter}} operations commenced out of Brønnøysund Airport in 1981, when Helikopter Service was contracted for fly to exploration {{field on}} Trænabanken. A combined fixed-wing and helicopter hangar {{was completed in}} 1983. The contract changed to Lufttransport from 1984. Operations remained limited and in 1989 the airport <b>only</b> <b>saw</b> 34 helicopter flights. The exploration resulted in a positive find on the Norne field, which started production in 1997. Norsk Helikopter, later renamed Bristow Norway, established a helicopter base at Brønnøysund Airport n 2002 and took over flights to the Skarv Oil Field.|$|E
5|$|On 15 January 1942, II./NJG1 {{transferred}} to Sint-Truiden—Saint-Trond in the French pronunciation—in Belgium. Schnaufer entered front-line service {{at a time}} when the RAF was reassessing the air offensive against Germany. The effectiveness of British Bomber Command to accurately hit German targets had been questioned by the War Cabinet Secretary David Bensusan-Butt who published the Butt Report in August 1941. The report in parts concluded that the British crews failed to navigate to, identify, and bomb their targets. Although the report was not widely accepted by senior RAF commanders, Prime Minister Winston Churchill, instructed Commander-in-Chief Richard Peirse that during the winter months only limited operations were to be conducted. Flight operations were also hindered by bad weather in the first months of 1942, so II./NJG1 <b>only</b> <b>saw</b> very limited action during that period.|$|E
5|$|Originally, in Tolkien's {{writings}} {{from the}} 1910s and 1920s, Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë (their final names) were {{the eldest of}} the Elves. By 1959 or 1960, Tolkien wrote {{a detailed account of}} the awakening of the Elves, called Cuivienyarna, part of Quendi and Eldar. Ingwë, Finwë and Elwë now became the first ambassadors and the Kings of the Elves. This text <b>only</b> <b>saw</b> print in The War of the Jewels, part of the analytical The History of Middle-earth series, in 1994, but a similar version was included in The Silmarillion in 1977.|$|E

During the second operation, in the fighting around Arnhem, 1st Airlanding Brigade {{along with the rest of}} 1st Airborne Division held out against overwhelming German odds, sustaining very heavy losses. Only around 20 percent of the brigade were evacuated south of the River Rhine. The rest had either been killed, were missing or became prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} Munro, an {{excellent}} observer who spent years on Lānai, <b>only</b> <b>saw</b> the bird three times implies {{that it was}} already very rare by the 1910s. From 1900 to 1940 nearly all of Lānai's forests were converted into pineapple fields. This conversion reduced {{the area of the}} hookbill's potential habitat, and {{is believed to be the}} biggest contributor to the species' extinction. It has also been suggested that avian malaria, which began affecting Lānai's birds in the 1920s, may have contributed to the species' decline. Likewise, the introduction of feral cats and rats to Lānai may have led to a decline in the hookbill's population. The extinction of local snails through human intervention could also have led to the Lānai hookbill's extinction.|$|E

Harry refuses to give Lucius the prophecy, and a battle between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters ensues.

5|$|Tracing its lineage {{back to the}} 355th Engineer Regiment, {{the brigade}} assumed its predecessor's {{campaign}} participation credit and honors, which were received fighting in the European Theater of World War II.

After the Cold War, however, the brigade saw several deployments to the Middle East in a supporting role for US-led contingencies. These included Operation Desert Storm, Operation Joint Endeavor, Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom.|$|E
5|$|Welles's alleged {{biological}} son Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who {{was born}} out of wedlock to Welles and actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, first met Welles when he was 15 and later worked on the 1960 stage play Chimes at Midnight. This was the only significant amount of time that the two spent together and afterwards Lindsay-Hogg <b>only</b> <b>saw</b> Welles sporadically. Like Welles, Lindsay-Hogg had two surrogate fathers in addition to his biological father. In the late 1950s when she was 16, Welles's eldest daughter Christopher Welles Feder cut off all ties with Welles under pressure from her mother, who disapproved of Welles's influence on her. Welles and Feder later reconnected but their relationship never fully recovered. Welles's youngest daughter Beatrice, who resembled her father as a young boy, appears in the film version of Chimes at Midnight.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} video games have been {{developed}} that tie to the Yu Yu Hakusho series, most {{of which have been}} produced for and released exclusively in Japan. Prior to the launch of the franchise in North America, games were released on the Game Boy, Super Famicom, Sega consoles, and various platforms. North America <b>only</b> <b>saw</b> three video game releases. Two releases for the Nintendo's Game Boy Advanced handheld console, and one release for Sony's PlayStation 2 console. A single Mega Drive game, Yū Yū Hakusho: Makyō Tōitsusen, was published in Brazil by Tectoy in 1999 under the title Yu Yu Hakusho: Sunset Fighters. When Atari gained publishing rights to Yu Yu Hakusho video games in 2003, the company created and released three games in these regions: , an action-adventure game for the Game Boy Advance; , a tactical role-playing game also for the Game Boy Advance; and , a 3D fighting game for the PlayStation 2.|$|E

5|$|British ships did not {{participate}} in any major wars in the ironclad period. The Royal Navy's ironclads <b>only</b> <b>saw</b> action as part of colonial battles or one-sided engagements like the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882. Defending British interests against Ahmed 'Urabi's Egyptian revolt, a British fleet opened fire on the fortifications around the port of Alexandria. A mixture of centre-battery and turret ships bombarded Egyptian positions for most of a day, forcing the Egyptians to retreat; return fire from Egyptian guns was heavy at first, but inflicted little damage, killing only five British sailors. Few Egyptian guns were actually dismounted, on the other hand, and the fortifications themselves were typically left intact. Had the Egyptians actually utilised the heavy mortars that were at their disposal, they might have quickly turned the tide, for the attacking British ironclads found it easy (for accuracy's sake) to simply anchor whilst firing—perfect targets for high-angle fire upon their thinly armored topdecks.|$|E
5|$|For Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro, the {{opportunity}} to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro {{had been one of}} more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, <b>only</b> <b>saw</b> a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he stepped back from the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, Mamie Eisenhower, as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former First Lady was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971. Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the Washington quarter.|$|E

On December 22, 2008, Último Guerrero won the championship from Dos Caras Jr., who shortly afterwards left CMLL to work for WWE. On April 2, 2009, Último Guerrero successfully defended the title against Rey Mendoza Jr. on an independent wrestling promotion show in Gomez Palacio, marking {{the first time the}} CMLL World Heavyweight Championship was defended on a non-CMLL promoted show. After a 963-day reign and 17 successful defenses, Guerrero lost the title to Héctor Garza on August 12, 2011. The championship was vacated on November 11, 2011, after Garza left CMLL for Perros del Mal Producciones, a group of former CMLL wrestlers who broke away from the promotion in late 2011. On January 1, 2012, El Terrible became the new champion when he defeated CMLL World Light Heavyweight Champion Rush in a decision match. The two had won a torneo cibernetico match a week earlier to earn spots in the match.|$|E

5|$|The LT vz. 34, {{formally}} {{designated as}} Lehký Tank vzor 34 ("Light Tank Model 34") was a Czechoslovak-designed light tank used mainly by Slovakia during World War II. Its suspension {{was based on}} that of the Carden-Loyd tankette, of which the Czechs had purchased three, plus a manufacturing license, in 1930. Dissatisfied with the prototypes of the Tančík vz. 33 tankette, the Czech Army decided {{that it would be}} easier to design a light tank from scratch rather than modify a tankette's chassis to carry a fully rotating armored turret. 50 were built, the last of which was delivered during 1936, of which the Germans captured 22 - including the prototype, when they occupied Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939, but they promptly scrapped them. The Slovaks seized the remaining 27 (18 + 9 nine LT vz. 34 light tanks which the Czechs had evacuated from Carpatho-Ukraine to Humene and Prešov.) when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia at the same time. In Slovak service it <b>only</b> <b>saw</b> combat during the Slovak National Uprising.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aircraft}} {{to land in}} Brønnøysund was a Hansa-Brandenburg seaplane of the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service on 23 July 1922. It was piloted by Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen and Finn Lützow-Holm, en route from Horten to Kirkenes. The following thirteen years Brønnøysund <b>only</b> <b>saw</b> occasional landings, when Norwegian Air Lines started a service from Bergen to Tromsø on 7 June 1935, which included {{a stop at the}} harbor in Brønnøysund. Passengers and mail would be rowed out to the waiting aircraft. The first season the route was flown using a single-engine Junkers W 34. The aircraft turned out to be too small and a larger Junkers Ju 52 was introduced the following season. Flights were dependent on good weather and were only operated during the summer. The route was taken over by Widerøe in 1938. All civilian flights were terminated during World War II, although the town would see occasional military landings.|$|E

The spy tailed Luan Da as he went forth alone, but <b>only</b> <b>saw</b> the mystic walk along the beach. Luan Da returned to his group and {{reported that he had}} seen his immortal master and that they were to report back to the emperor.
