5|$|A Book of the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives <b>of</b> <b>someone</b> recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives {{the price of a}} Book of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E

5|$|Because {{no money}} is {{exchanged}} and laws are rarely broken, {{there is little}} legal recourse to take upon discovery <b>of</b> <b>someone</b> faking illness. However, a participant in a 7,000-member online support group brought a lawsuit against a website for defamatory language in 2005. The lawsuit followed heated discussion on the website about his dire predicaments and related crises, which seemed to contradict medical knowledge and his own accounts. The lawsuit was withdrawn after the presiding judge intended to allow cross-examination of the plaintiff's medical history.|$|E

The tomb contained the skeleton of an elderly man with rich offerings and evidence of battle wounds. The remains have been identified as those of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' due to their location underneath a sequence of seven buildings erected in his honor.

5|$|WASP-13 is a sunlike, G-type {{star that}} is {{situated}} approximately 156 parsecs (509 light years) in the Lynx constellation. With an apparent magnitude of 10.42, the star cannot {{be seen with}} the unaided eye from the perspective <b>of</b> <b>someone</b> on Earth. The star's effective temperature, at 5826 K, is hotter than that of the Sun. However, its metallicity is similar; this can be seen in how the concentration of iron, or , is approximately 0. WASP-13's surface gravity is measured at 4.04 km/s2, while the rate at which it rotates is at most 4.9 km/s.|$|E

5|$|An example <b>of</b> <b>someone</b> {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and who saw the former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E

At the amphitheater, Arhys changes his mind on the deal, and when Daryus shows up, they start a fight. Daryus overpowers Arhys and kills him ("The Path That Divides"), unaware that Xander followed them and saw the whole scene. As Xander runs to his father's dead body, Daryus sees the silhouette <b>of</b> <b>someone</b> approaching him. Assuming it to be Gabriel, he attempts to kill him, realising too late that it is actually Faythe ("The Walking Shadow"). Gabriel arrives at the scene and sees his dead brother and the dying Faythe. Covering Xander's ears, he unleashes a scream that causes Daryus to go deaf and that is heard by Nafaryus, Arabelle, and the entire town ("My Last Farewell").|$|E
5|$|Being the South's {{first line}} of defense against foreign threats, the NSS houses {{technology}} unavailable to their sister intelligence agencies. The two primary tech agents, Yang Mi-jung (Juni) and Hwang Tae-sung (Na Yoon), are often responsible for ensuring field agents have all that is required to see their missions through. Mi-jung does not meet the expected conventions <b>of</b> <b>someone</b> involved in national intelligence. Given that her sense of fashion and general interests are more contemporary than that of her associates, she often stands out from the others, but her status as the top hacker in Korea has made her irreplaceable. Still, Tae-sung remains the more perdurable of the two and is often instrumental in the success of a number of operations.|$|E
