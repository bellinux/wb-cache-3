40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if snorers have a narrower <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> area because of fat infiltration, and an elevated body mass index. Materials and Methods: Ten control subjects and 19 patients that snored were evaluated. We obtained 2 -mm-thick axial CT scan images every 0. 6 seconds during expiration and inspiration at the same level of the oropharynx. We selected the largest and the smallest <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> areas and found the differences. From the slice that had the smallest <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> area, the thickness of the parapharyngeal and subcutaneous fat was measured. The measurements from the left and right side were added together and single values for parapharyngeal and subcutaneous fat tissue thickness were then found.

40|$|In adults, first {{responders}} to a cardiopulmonary arrest provide better ventilation using a laryngeal mask airway than a facemask. It is unclear {{if the same}} is true in children. We investigated this by comparing the ability of 36 paediatric ward nurses to ventilate the lungs of 99 anaesthetised children (a model for cardiopulmonary arrest) using a laryngeal mask airway and using a facemask with an <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway.</b> Anteroposterior chest wall displacement was measured using an ultrasonic detector. Nurses achieved successful ventilation in 74 (75 %) of cases with the laryngeal mask airway and 76 (77 %) with facemask and <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> (p = 0. 89). Median (IQR [range]) time to first breath was longer for the laryngeal mask airway (48 (39 - 65 [8 - 149])) s than the facemask/airway (35 (25 - 53 [14 - 120]) s; p < 0. 0001). In 10 cases (10 %) the lungs were ventilated using the laryngeal mask airway but not using the facemask/oropharyngeal airway.

40|$|Objectives 1) To {{determine}} the {{accuracy and reliability}} of an automated anthropometric measurement software for the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> and 2) To compare the anthropometric dimensions of the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> in skeletal class II and III deformity patients. Methods Cone-beam CT (CBCT) scans of 62 patients with skeletal class II or III deformities were used for this study. Volumetric, linear and surface area measurements retroglossal (RG) and retropalatal (RP) compartments of the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> was measured with the 3 dMDVultus software. Accuracy of automated anthropometric pharyngeal airway measurements was assessed using an airway phantom. Results The software {{was found to be}} reasonably accurate for measuring dimensions of air passages. The total oropharyngeal volume was significantly greater in the skeletal class III deformity group (16. 7 ± 9. 04 mm 3) compared with class II subjects (11. 87 ± 4. 01 mm 3). The average surface area of both the RG and RP compartments were significantly larger in the class III deformity group. The most constricted area in the RG and RP airway was significantly larger in individuals with skeletal class III deformity. The anterior-posterior (AP) length of this constriction was significantly greater in skeletal class III individuals in both compartments, whereas the width of the constriction was not significantly different between the two groups in both compartments. The RP compartment was larger but less uniform than the RG compartment in both skeletal deformities. Conclusion Significant differences were observed in morphological characteristics of the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> in individuals with skeletal class II and III deformities. This information may be valuable for surgeons in orthognathic treatment planning, especially for mandibular setback surgery that might compromise the oropharyngeal patency. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{research}} hypothesis {{under test}} was that functional orthopaedic treatment with the Twin-block appliance increases the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> {{as well as}} correcting the jaw relationships in class II division 1 patients. Method: 20 cases, 10 male, 10 female. Age range: 11 - 18 years, average treatment time 9. 4 months {{were randomly selected from}} the records of a previously completed prospective trial. Cephalometric radiographs taken before and after treatment were analysed. p, the shortest distance between the soft palate and posterior pharyngeal wall and t, the shortest distance between the tongue and the posterior pharyngeal wall were measured. Results: There was a statistically significant increase in both p and t after Twin-block appliance treatment (p= 0. 000). A control group selected from normative data matched individually for age and sex and treatment time showed no change over the same growth period. Conclusions: In Class II division 1 malocclusion, the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> is already reduced compared to Class I and Class II. Treatment involving premolar extraction and incisor retraction further reduces the airway as does headgear and is contraindicated. Functional appliance treatment is the method of choice as it enlarges the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> reducing the potential for obstructive sleep apnoea...|$|R

40|$|Sleep apnea {{disorder}} {{has recently}} {{emerged as a}} significant public health issue. While the prevalence of obesity {{is on the rise}} among children, {{it is one of the}} main risk factors associated with apnea. Upper airway dimensions and morphology seem to be major components of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and can be affected by different craniofacial patterns. The purpose of this retrospective, cross-sectional pilot study is to correlate gender, Body Mass Index, risk for OSA, neck circumference, and 3 -D <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> dimensions in children and adolescents with different antero-posterior (AP) and vertical craniofacial skeletal patterns. A total of 86 pre-orthodontic treatment records in the age group of 8 - 16 years were analyzed. 3 -D volumetric skeletal tracing and <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> measurements were completed for each scan. Each subject was classified into AP Classes I, II, and III groups; vertical Normodivergent, Hypodivergent, and Hyperdivergent groups; and combined AP-vertical subgroups. <b>Oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> measurements included the total <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> volume, minimum cross-section area, depth, width, and perimeter. Mean, standard deviation, and Pearson 2 ̆ 7 s correlation coefficient were performed to evaluate the relationships among variables. There were one or more correlations, but not all, between gender, Body Mass Index, risk for OSA, neck circumference, and 3 -D <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> dimensions in children and adolescents among the AP groups, vertical groups, and nine craniofacial subgroups (P 3 ̆c 0. 05 and P 3 ̆c 0. 01). This investigation aimed to determine whether patients with certain skeletal deficiencies are predisposed to upper airway obstruction. Early identification and management of airway problems in children and adolescents may prevent or minimize the sequelae and adverse dental implications of obstructive sleep apnea. Our small, young groups of sample were mainly in the healthy weight category with normal size neck circumference. Therefore, this limited our overall findings. Currently, sleep disorders are not well researched and understood. Long-term goal of our study is to further investigate this study in larger sample size taken into considerations predisposing factors (i. e. abnormal neural regulation and intrinsic muscle weakness) and pathologic conditions (allergies, polyps, and tumors). The physiology of the airway, influenced by these confounding factors, has an essential role in determining whether patients with certain skeletal deficiencies are predisposed to upper airway obstruction. Sleep apnea is a complex phenomenon that warrants further research regarding the physiology and anatomy of the airway and craniofacial structures...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the correlation between the pharyngeal airway space and head posture after mandibular setback surgery for mandibular prognathism. Materials and Methods. Serial lateral cephalograms of 37 patients with mandibular prognathism who underwent intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy (IVRO) were evaluated before (T 1) and immediately (T 2), between 6 weeks and 3 months (T 3), and more than 1 year (T 4) after surgery. Paired t-tests and Pearson’s correlation analysis were used to evaluate the postoperative changes in all cephalometric parameters, including the mandible, hyoid, head posture (craniocervical angle), and pharyngeal airway space. Results. The mandible and hyoid were set back by 12. 8 [*]mm and 4. 9 [*]mm, respectively, at T 2. Furthermore, the hyoid showed significant inferior movement of 10. 7 [*]mm, with an 8 [*]mm increase in the tongue depth. The upper <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> (UOP) shortened by 4. 1 [*]mm, the lower <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> (LOP) by 1. 7 [*]mm, and the laryngopharyngeal airway by 2 [*]mm. The craniocervical angle showed a significant increase of 2. 8 °. UOP and LOP showed a significant correlation with the craniocervical angle at T 2 and T 4. Conclusions. Our findings conclude that the <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> space is significantly decreased and correlated with a change in the head posture after mandibular setback surgery...|$|R
50|$|Resistance to bag valve mask {{may suggest}} {{presence}} of a foreign body that is obstructing airways and commonly used as a diagnostic tool and treatment for respiratory arrest. The bag-valve-mask device has a self-inflating bag with a soft mask that rests on the face. When the bag is connected to an oxygen supply, the patient will receive 60 to 100% of inspired oxygen. The purpose of bag-valve-mask is to provide adequate temporary ventilation and allow the body to achieve airway control by itself. However, if the bag-valve-mask is left {{on for more than}} five minutes, air may be introduced into the stomach. At that point, a nasogastric tube should be inserted to take the accumulated air out. During this process, practitioners must carefully position and maneuver the bag-valve-mask in order to keep <b>airways</b> open. An <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> is used during bag-valve-mask ventilation to prevent oropharynx soft tissues from blocking the <b>airway.</b> An <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> may cause gagging and vomiting. Therefore, an <b>oropharyngeal</b> <b>airway</b> must be sized appropriately. It should be as long as distance between corner of patient’s mouth and angle of the jaw is calculated correctly. For children, pediatric bags can be used. Pediatric bags have a valve that limits peak airway pressures to around 35-40 cm of water. Practitioners must tweak valve settings to accurately determine each of their patients to avoid hypoventilation or hyperventilation.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Current {{epidemiological}} {{approaches to}} radon dosimetry yield a dose conversion factor (DCF) of 4 mSv WLM 1 while the dosimetric approaches give a value closer to 13 mSv WLM 1. The present study investigated whether {{the application of}} compartment models for the bronchial (BB) and bronchiolar (bb) re-gions, rather than more anatomically realistic <b>airway</b> <b>tube</b> models, has brought the dosimetric DCF to the higher values. The <b>airway</b> <b>tube</b> model of the tracheo-bronchial tree was {{used to calculate the}} effective dose per unit radon exposure. All other elements of the human respiratory tract from the reports of the ICRP or NRC were adopted. A dosimetric derivation of the radon DCF using the <b>airway</b> <b>tube</b> model yielded a value of 14. 2 mSv WLM 1. This value is slightly larger than, but not significantly different from, the result obtained through the ICRP 66 approach. It is concluded that utilization of the <b>airway</b> <b>tube</b> model instead of the re-gional ICRP 66 compartmental model cannot reconcile the gap between dose conversion factors derived from epidemiological and dosimetric approaches...|$|R
