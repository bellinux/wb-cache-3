5|$|The Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California, {{features}} a life-size {{model of a}} mother blue whale with her calf suspended from the ceiling of its main hall. The Beaty Biodiversity Museum at the University of British Columbia, Canada, houses a display <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> whale skeleton (skull is cast replica) directly on the main campus boulevard. A real skeleton <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> whale at the Canadian Museum of Nature in Ottawa was also unveiled in May 2010. The Royal Ontario Museum obtained a blue whale, which died in Newfoundland and Labrador in 2014, and began an exhibition in 2016 to display its skeleton in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|For the 2017–18 season, {{the home}} kit {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> shirt with white trim {{at the neck}} and white stripes down the side seams, white shorts with blue trim and blue stripes down the side seams, and blue socks with white trim at the turnover. The away kit reverses the colours of the home kit. The kits are supplied by Adidas and bear the logo of online bookmaker 888sport, the club's main sponsor.|$|E
5|$|Her primary outfit {{consists}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> {{and white}} wrestling leotard with an eyemask and knee-length white boots. Her outfit slightly differed, {{depending on the}} game. In Alpha 3, her breasts were covered by two blue heart shaped patterns, but in SFV the blue hearts were replaced by a heart-shaped hole in the chest of her leotard.|$|E

5|$|The first heraldic {{symbol that}} can be {{associated}} with what would become the Portuguese nation was on the shield used by Henry of Burgundy, Count of Portugal since 1095, during his battles with the Moors. This shield consisted <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> cross over a white field. Nevertheless, this design has no reliable sources since it is a reconstruction that became popular and widely accepted thanks to the nationalistic purposes of the Estado Novo regime.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} aberrations. The 1992 kit, {{sponsored}} by Triton Showers, was made <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> material covered with multicoloured splashes which resembled a shower curtain. Birmingham have only worn stripes {{on their home}} shirt once; in 1999 they wore a blue shirt with a front central panel in narrow blue and white stripes, a design similar to the Tesco supermarket carrier bag of the time.|$|E
5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as fast as warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E

5|$|Directed by Peter Maris, {{the game}} {{features}} {{a cast of}} 25 actors, all performing in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> screen. While most games at the time featured 80 to 100 backgrounds, Phantasmagoria includes more than 1,000. A professional Hollywood special effects house worked on the game, and the musical score includes a neo-Gregorian chant performed by a 135-voice choir. Sierra stressed it was intended for adult audiences. The company willingly submitted it to a ratings system, and included a password-protected censoring option within the game to tone down the graphic content.|$|E
5|$|For the {{interior}} scenes used {{to depict the}} first moments of the Impala being hit, the actors were required {{to sit in the}} car in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> screen; this allowed for the truck's headlights to later be added in with visual effects. The car itself was attached to a separate rig that was built to replicate the impact of the crash. As the scene was shot, the rig flipped the car onto its side. The passenger-side window was then shattered, though the actors were protected by a sheet of Lexan that had been placed very close to the window; at the same time, cannons beneath the frame blew out pieces of rubber glass to give the appearance that the window had exploded onto them.|$|E
5|$|Service members {{holding a}} blue {{discharge}} {{were subjected to}} discrimination in civilian life. They were denied {{the benefits of the}} G.I. Bill by the Veterans Administration and had difficulty finding work because employers were aware of the negative connotations <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> discharge. Following intense criticism in the press—especially the black press, because of the high percentage of African Americans who received blue discharges—and in Congress, the blue discharge was discontinued in 1947, replaced by two new classifications: general and undesirable.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} the Saint Andrew's Cross as a flag {{is found in the}} Vienna Book of Hours, circa 1503, in which a white saltire is depicted with a red background. In the case of Scotland, use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the 15th century, with the first certain illustration of a flag depicting such appearing in Sir David Lyndsay of the Mount's Register of Scottish Arms, circa 1542.|$|E
5|$|The home jersey {{worn by the}} Mariners {{is mostly}} yellow with sleeves that are navy blue. The away uniform is a mostly plain navy blue jersey with yellow as a {{secondary}} colour. In the 2011–12 season, the club had its kits manufactured by Hummel, as the A-League's Reebok deal had expired {{at the conclusion of}} the 2010–11 season. In September 2012, it was announced that the Mariners had signed a two-year deal with Kappa for them to be the official apparel supplier.

5|$|The legend {{surrounding}} Scotland's {{association with}} the Saint Andrew's Cross was related by Walter Bower and George Buchanan, who claimed that the flag originated in a 9th-century battle, where Óengus II led a combined force of Picts and Scots to victory over the Angles, led by Æthelstan. Supposedly, a miraculous white saltire appeared in the blue sky and Óengus' troops were roused to victory by the omen. Consisting <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> background over which is placed a white representation of an X-shaped cross, the Saltire is one of Scotland's most recognisable symbols.|$|E
5|$|These {{events are}} {{at the tail end}} of the long GRB {{duration}} distribution, lasting more than 10,000 seconds. They have been proposed to form a separate class, caused by the collapse <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> supergiant star, a tidal disruption event or a new-born magnetar. Only a small number have been identified to date, their primary characteristic being their gamma ray emission duration. The most studied ultra-long events include GRB 101225A and GRB 111209A. The low detection rate may be a result of low sensitivity of current detectors to long-duration events, rather than a reflection of their true frequency. A 2013 study, on the other hand, shows that the existing evidence for a separate ultra-long GRB population with a new type of progenitor is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength observations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion.|$|E
5|$|A German mutant with {{a strong}} Catholic faith and the {{appearance}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>blue</b> demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. He is capable of teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. Nightcrawler can teleport through walls, but prefers to only teleport when he can see his landing site. On his body are many scarification marks, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but at first he was not available due to scheduling conflicts. At some point, Ethan Embry had {{been reported to be}} in contention for the role. Ultimately, the film remained in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also felt comfortable in casting him since he speaks German fluently. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design, which took four hours to apply. For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours of makeup. To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.|$|E
