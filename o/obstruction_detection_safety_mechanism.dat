50|$|The Winchester Model 131 is a clip feed {{bolt action}} repeater. The {{magazine}} holds 7 rounds. Unlike the model 121 the safety is manual {{and it is}} not turned on when a round is loaded. The safety may be on or off when a round is loaded. Incorrect assembly of the <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> on the Model 131 can cause accidental discharge and failure of the <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> by allowing the <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> to walk on the retaining bolt.

50|$|The M1905/M1906 Vest Pocket pistol {{incorporated}} a grip <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> that constituted the entire rear {{section of the}} grip. This particular <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> required {{a significant amount of}} hand palm pressure to disengage and allow the trigger to release the striker to fire the pistol. Colt produced a nearly identical pocket pistol, the Colt Model 1908 Vest Pocket, which {{incorporated a}} small safety lever {{on the left side of}} the receiver which locked the trigger. In addition, this <b>safety</b> lever <b>mechanism</b> locked the slide about a half inch back from the front of the pistol to enable easy disassembly. FN also added this <b>safety</b> lever <b>mechanism</b> to its pistol, but did not add the magazine <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> that Colt introduced in 1916.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> {{capable of}} moving at will {{within the range}} of its whole link lengths is {{designed}} based on the link space. Sixteen extreme poses are obtained in a Stewart platform. The singular points of the extreme poses are solved by using homotopy method as well as the judgment condition of singular points, and thereby the maximum link lengths are achieved. The rotation angles of joints and the distances between two neighboring links are analyzed in a calculation example in which that the mechanism moves among the extreme poses is assumed. Then an algorithm to test the <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> is presented taking the constraint conditions into account. A <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> having optimal properties of global movement is worked out by optimizing all structural parameters through minimizing the average condition number of extreme poses...|$|R

40|$|The {{systemic}} {{origins of}} many accidents {{have led to}} heightened interest {{in the way in}} which organisations identify and manage risks within the airline industry. The activities which are thought to represent the term "organisational accident", "safety culture" and "proactive approach" are documented and seek to explain the fact that airlines differ in their willingness and ability to conduct safety management. However, an important but yet relatively undefined task in the airline industry is to conceptualise the <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> in proactive <b>safety,</b> and its influential factors. What is required is a model of a proactive <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> which builds upon existing knowledge of what is thought to contribute to safety by adding an increased knowledge of the organisational factors. These factors not only serve to influence the <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism,</b> but also serve to be the predictors of the performance of safety management system. This thesis aims to fill that gap. It firstly conducts an overview of the current airline safety management system literature and identifies the strengths and weaknesses of the current system. Given the need to explore the important but undefined field, a proactive <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> model is then developed and tested to identify the organisational factors which exert an influence upon the <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism.</b> Four hypotheses were set out to be tested in an attempt to justify the multi-dimensional and complex nature of the <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> model. The model is then tested by applying it to a past accident (case study) and a survey of opinions with questionnaire. The results of this research work show that the <b>safety</b> <b>mechanism</b> model is a model of the evolution of safety management system in the context of proactive safety management. Further study can apply the proposed model to the re-organisation of an airline safety management system and evaluate the impact upon the company's system. It leads to the suggestion that an airline's safety health and performance needs the co-ordination of both retroactive and proactive safety management, and concludes that the ultimate contribution of this research is to provide airlines with reliable data, applicable references and a practicable methodology to enable their safety management system to evolve at a fundamentally "genetic" level.
