500|$|... "At Long Last Leave", {{which is}} the 500th episode of The Simpsons, was written by Michael Price. The Simpsons showrunner Al Jean has {{described}} it as [...] "a tribute to people who love the show." [...] Being a fan of musical theater, Price titled the episode {{in reference to the}} Cole Porter song [...] "At Long Last Love". Price did not write [...] "At Long Last Leave" [...] with the intention of it becoming the 500th episode; that decision was made afterwards when the staff members realized the story offered an opportunity for a look-back at the history of the Simpson family. He {{said in an interview with}} the magazine Channel Guide that he was [...] "deeply honored" [...] when his episode was selected for the milestone. As acknowledged by Price in that interview, the plot of the episode features similarities to the 2007 film The Simpsons Movie, in which the Simpsons are forced to flee to Alaska after Homer angers the townspeople in Springfield by polluting a lake. However, Price commented that [...] "I think it's different from the movie in that it sort <b>of</b> <b>does</b> reference back the entire history of the show, the collective experience of Springfield vis-a-vis the Simpsons, whereas the movie they were forced to run away due to that very specific thing". He further noted that despite the similarities [...] "we [...] liked it enough to go with it anyway." [...] The plot was first announced to the press at the Comic-Con convention in San Diego, California on July 23, 2011, during a panel with the cast and crew of The Simpsons.|$|E

Leno took the car for a test drive in the California mountains and had raving impressions of the LFA driving dynamics, handling, chassis rigidity and engine sound. Leno stated that the LFA was [...] "one of the greatest supercars ever built and certainly the best supercar ever to have come out Japan".

2500|$|The country's {{climate is}} {{influenced}} chiefly by the mountains, Kyrgyzstan's position {{near the middle}} of the Eurasian landmass, and the absence of any body of water large enough to influence weather patterns. Those factors create a distinctly continental climate that has significant local variations. Although the mountains tend to collect clouds and block sunlight (reducing some narrow valleys at certain times of year to no more than three or four hours of sunlight per day), the country is generally sunny, receiving as much as 2,900 hours of sunlight per year in some areas. The same conditions also affect temperatures, which can vary significantly from place to place. In January the warmest average temperature (...) occurs around the southern city of Osh, and around Ysyk-Köl. The latter, which has a volume <b>of</b> , <b>does</b> not freeze in winter.

2500|$|Nick Monson {{booked a}} two-hour session with songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter to adjust {{one of their}} compositions. Finishing the {{adjustment}} in 45 minutes, they {{decided to use the}} remaining time to write another song so that they would not waste the money for the studio time they paid for. [...] "Good for You" [...] was subsequently written in 45 minutes. It began with Monson playing its bassline and putting a snap on it before Michaels freestyled the opening lyric, [...] "I'm on my 14 carats". Her lyrics were influenced by her boyfriend who told her, [...] "Julia, you never write any happy songs for me. It's kind of sad," [...] to which she responded: [...] "Fine, I'll write a good song about you, shut up!". Tranter's lyrics were inspired by his ex-boyfriend who preferred him to dress femme. Upon hearing [...] "Good for You", the trio's A told them that the song should be recorded by Selena Gomez, despite Tranter initially thinking the song was [...] "too indie" [...] for her. The A sent the track to the singer who [...] "freaked out", deeming it the artistic direction she had envisioned for her second studio album, Revival (2015). She described the song as [...] "a piece that was just everything I feel a woman should embody, but not in the obvious way" [...] and explained to iHeartRadio: [...] "I think it just sets the tone perfect for the record just because it's sexy, but not trying too hard. The track and everything kind <b>of</b> <b>does</b> it itself. It's sensual, it reps women in a good way. I think it does something to a woman when they look good".|$|E
