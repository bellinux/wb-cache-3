5|$|British Rail {{formally}} {{announced plans}} to close the station on 15 March 1984, pending a statutory consultation process. Closure notices were posted at Marylebone. The proposals proved controversial and faced strong opposition from local authorities and the public, leading to a legal battle which lasted for two years. Despite the pending closure, passenger numbers only dropped by about 400 per day from 1968 levels. The conversion project proved impractical due to the headroom limitations <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> the closure was quietly dropped.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro {{played in}} the Davis Cup Final, with the title <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> looking to fulfill his {{childhood}} dream. He lost in the second rubber to David Ferrer, despite being two sets to one up, eventually losing in a pulsating five-set contest in a match lasting over five hours. With his country down 2–1, del Potro needed to beat Rafael Nadal in the reverse singles to keep the tie going. Del Potro dominated the first set, but could not keep his level up and lost in four sets. For {{the third time in}} six years, Argentina lost in the finals of the Davis Cup World Group, this time 3–1.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{suffering}} over 50 percent casualties by {{this time}} and with few reinforcements, 3rd Ranger Company remained <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>and</b> {{was used as a}} reconnaissance element for the division. As the 3rd Infantry Division advanced, pressing gains from the Chinese, the company was used to guard a vital bridge over the Hantan River. It then massed with several combat engineers and other division elements to form Task Force Rogers. The task force then probed north searching for Chinese concentrations, but did not encounter any Chinese troops.|$|E
5|$|Levanger Station is {{the most}} {{spectacular}} station <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> also the best preserved town station. Built entirely in stone, it has a dominant position in town and with a park {{in front of the}} station. It was designed in combined Medieval style, with strong elements of Gothic and Romanesque style. Steinkjer Station was the other station entirely built in stone. It has a combined Baroque Revival and Art Nouveau style, and is more anonymous than Levanger Station. Its characteristics were largely lost after it was connected with the bus station. Three stations, Langstein, Skogn and Levanger, have been preserved, while Skatval and Hell have been protected.|$|E

There have been several incidents of train guards being attacked by passengers who refused to pay their fares, including one incident where the guard was dragged from the train and knocked to the ground. Vandals have also damaged the station's ticket machines, attacked passengers and slashed the tyres of cars parked at the station.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Oslo Sporveier {{decided to}} {{transfer}} all the remaining trams to Bærumsbanen. Their high speed made them well suited on the light rail, but the centre door reduced their capacity. The order of the SM53-series from Høka gave Oslo Sporveier sufficient stock to operate the street lines, and from 1952 to 1957, the company transferred the 19 trams to Bærumsbanen. Here, they were given the designation Class E. No. 163 was in too bad condition to be used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>and</b> was retired. In October 1949, no. 184 caught fire and was taken out of service. On 2 August 1958, five people perished and 17 were injured in the Strømsveien tram fire, the worst disaster in the tramway's history.|$|E

5|$|Engineers Robert W. Blackwell & Co {{provided}} a small 0-4-0 electric locomotive capable of pulling two loaded coal wagons. It {{is not known}} where the locomotive was manufactured, as the company has no record, but {{the design of the}} controls suggests that it may have been imported from Germany. A small railcar with space for 12passengers was also provided. The locomotive and the railcar were each fitted with a single trolley pole to collect electricity from the overhead wire. The passenger car was used for the duration of passenger services <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>and</b> the locomotive from the electrification of the line until closure in 1959. At that time, it was the oldest operational electric locomotive in the British Isles.|$|E
5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back down the line. Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> is called a standing wave.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, a Gullfisk {{lost control}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> derailed near Sjømansskolen, causing the tram to be scrapped. From 1977, Oslo Sporveier also put SM53 trams into service. This was not sufficient, and Oslo Sporveier {{considered}} introducing the old Ekeberg Line trams. But {{this would be}} costly, as the vehicles {{would have to be}} upgraded. Instead, used MBG trams from the Gothenburg Tramway were put into service. The section from Sæter to Ljabru had since the opening had a signaling system that had worked fine with 15- and 20-minute headways, but did not work properly with 10-minute routes. A new system was installed, and proved to work just as poorly as the old system. During 1979, the section was rebuilt to double track, although the short bridge over Nordstrandsveien was kept single tracked.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, all {{the trains}} were {{equipped}} with weapons so the drivers could kill animals {{hit by the}} trains. About 100 game are killed each year along the line. In September, NSB Anbud launched a service allowing passenger riding from the Gjøvik and Toten areas to transfer to a coach at Roa Station, and continue onwards to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Since the establishment, NSB Anbud has requested an additional passing loop on the Gjøvik Line. This will allow more freight trains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>and</b> reduce travel time for the passenger trains by four minutes. The investment would cost NOK 50 to 70 million. During 2007, the company also accused the Norwegian National Rail Administration of giving the Gjøvik Line less priority in maintenance just because NSB Anbud had their train run more on time than trains operated by other companies.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, NSB {{started to}} {{consider}} {{replacement of the}} class. In 1971 and 1973, El 11 and El 13 were test-run <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>and</b> {{it was concluded that}} El 11 would be suitable with minor adjustments. However, the 1960s replacement of steam locomotives had caused a shortage of electric locomotives. Not until 1980 did NSB start the upgrade process of two El 11s. From 1980s, only a single El 9 was stationed on the Flåm Line during winter, and the other two were used for local trains on the Bergen Line in Hallingdal. If the unit stationed in Flåm was out of order, it was replaced by a Class 64 unit. Lack of spare parts and limited reliability accelerated the need to replace the units in scheduled trains. The first unit was taken into use on the Flåm Line in 1983 and the second in 1984. Two El 9s were transferred to Ål Station and Voss Station where they hauled work trains. Unit 2062 was taken out of service in 1983. The other two remained in regular service until 1988. Unit 2063 has been painted green and is on display at Flåm Station, while 2064 has retained the red color scheme and is stored at Tinnoset Station, belonging to the Norwegian Railway Museum.|$|E

5|$|New {{locomotives}} {{were ordered}} from Stephenson's, {{but the first}} was too heavy when it arrived in February 1828. It was rebuilt with six wheels and hailed as a great improvement, Hackworth being told to convert the remaining locomotives as soon as possible. In 1828 two locomotive boilers exploded within four months, both killing the driver and both due to the safety valves being left fixed down while the engine was stationary. Horses were also used <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>and</b> they could haul up to four waggons. The dandy cart was introduced in mid-1828: a small cart {{at the end of}} the train, this carried the horse downhill, allowing it to rest and the train to run at higher speed. The S made their use compulsory from November 1828.|$|E
5|$|Obstacles for the {{proposal}} include the proposed Cross-Harbor Rail Tunnel, {{the lack of}} electrification <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>and</b> the single-tracking {{in some parts of}} the line. The current iteration of the plan would have its northern terminus be Co-Op City South using the Hells Gate Branch. The LIRR Bay Ridge Branch and the New York Connecting Railroad have freight operating along them, and are regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). FRA rules require a certain distance between freight and passenger trains that share rights-of-way, and as a result it is uncertain whether the right-of-way is wide enough or if more durable train cars are needed to be able to share the same tracks. The RPA's 2015 plan considered having FRA compliant light rail vehicles run over the line. In addition to providing transfer opportunities, the line would provide transit access to areas without it in Glendale and Middle Village in Queens, and in Flatlands and Canarsie in Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|Reyes {{received}} his first yellow {{card in the}} 76th minute, when he was late in tackling Silvestre after the French defender had played a backpass to Carroll. The break in play allowed Manchester United to make their first substitution, bringing on Fortune for O'Shea, {{who appeared to be}} struggling with a calf injury. With six minutes left in normal time, United won a corner on the left hand side, which Ronaldo played short to Scholes. Scholes returned the ball to Ronaldo, who crossed it into the penalty area, where Keane was unmarked at the back post. The ball eventually broke to the United captain, who shot, only to see four Arsenal players between him and the goal, ready to block his effort behind for another corner. Lehmann came to meet the second corner kick, but missed the ball, allowing it {{to go all the way}} through to Van Nistelrooy; the Dutchman headed the ball goalwards, but Ljungberg was <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>and</b> headed it up onto the crossbar and away.|$|E
