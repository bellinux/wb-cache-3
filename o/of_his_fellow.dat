5|$|In 1996, Hickenbottom {{posed for}} a non-nude layout in Playgirl magazine. Only after he posed did he {{discover}} Playgirl has a mostly homosexual readership, for which some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> wrestlers teased him.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{frequently}} {{clashed with}} the prison's management over the mistreatment <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> prisoners. Sometimes he was put into solitary confinement, with one stay lasting 16 months. When Berkman smuggled reports of corruption and brutality outside the prison, resulting in an investigation, {{he was taken to}} the dungeon and put in a straitjacket.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{views on}} the 2011 budget cuts and his departures from GOP {{consensus}} placed him at odds with some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> Republicans and prominent Tea Party conservatives, including Glenn Beck. He said he opposed these measures because he believed {{that they would have}} a negative impact on low income families and children.|$|E

60|$|Strickland chuckled. He did {{not seem}} discouraged. He was {{independent}} of the opinion <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellows.</b>|$|R

5|$|George Clooney as Lieutenant Matt Kowalski, the {{commander}} of the team. Kowalski is a veteran astronaut planning to retire after the Explorer expedition. He enjoys telling stories about himself and joking with his team, and is determined to protect the lives <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> astronauts.|$|E
5|$|He {{rejected}} German racial supremacy {{and instead}} saw the Norwegian race as the progenitor of northern Europe, tracing {{his own family}} tree in his spare time. Party members did not receive preferential treatment, though Quisling did not himself share in the wartime hardships <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> Norwegians. Nevertheless, many gifts went unused {{and he did not}} live extravagantly.|$|E
5|$|His {{popularity}} {{was such}} that, after he {{enlisted in the}} military, so many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> Princeton athletes followed his lead that the school had to cancel its hockey team for the 1917â€“18 season; all five starting players enlisted in the armed forces. Of the eleven players on the team the previous season, nine enlisted shortly after Baker.|$|E
60|$|The Indian, {{either by}} {{accident}} or design, had guided Brandt to a band <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellows,</b> and thus led Wetzel almost into an ambush.|$|R
60|$|But Ogu was a bushman, lacking {{knowledge}} of the almost universal beche-de- mer English, {{and half a dozen}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellows</b> wrangled to explain.|$|R

5|$|In July 1793, Bonaparte {{published}} a pro-republican pamphlet entitled Le souper de Beaucaire (Supper at Beaucaire) which gained him {{the support of}} Augustin Robespierre, younger brother of the Revolutionary leader Maximilien Robespierre. With the help <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> Corsican Antoine Christophe Saliceti, Bonaparte was appointed artillery commander of the republican forces at the Siege of Toulon.|$|E
5|$|Mahmud (Rd. Mochtar), a fisherman, is in {{love with}} Wagini (Soekarsih), a farmer's daughter. However, local superstition {{dictates}} that their relationship will bring disaster. This seems to prove true after the village leader's keris is stolen, but eventually Mahmud and Wagini are able to unite with the help <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> villagers.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of his studies, Kenyatta and Malinowski became close friends. Fellow course-mates {{included}} the anthropologists Audrey Richards, Lucy Mair, and Elspeth Huxley. Another <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> LSE students was Prince Peter of Greece and Denmark, who invited Kenyatta to come and stay with him and his mother, Princess Marie Bonaparte, in Paris during the spring of 1936.|$|E

60|$|Their {{beauty is}} almost this, this strange, {{clean-cut}} isolation, as if {{each one of}} them would isolate himself still further and for ever from the rest <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellows.</b>|$|R

5|$|When the Nationalists {{came into}} power in December 1928, Kent Hughes was {{appointed}} Cabinet Secretary and Government Whip but resigned his positions in July 1929, ostensibly in protest over a government subsidy to a freezing works company but more likely {{in reaction to}} the ongoing boneheadedness <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> parliamentarians.|$|E
5|$|Arriving in Brisbane for the Commonwealth Games, Brooks {{and some}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> sprinters shaved their heads, {{something}} that received much {{attention from the}} Australian public. He won his heat of the 100m freestyle in a Commonwealth and Commonwealth Games record of 51.09s. He swam slower in the final, but his time of 51.14s was enough to secure {{the gold medal in}} a close contest. Just 0.43s separated him and the bronze and silver medallists Greg Fasala and Michael Delany, both of Australia.|$|E
5|$|As president-elect, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Washington, not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849. He spent the {{months following the}} election formulating his cabinet selections. He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions, to the frustration <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> Whigs. While he despised patronage and political games, he endured a flurry of advances from office-seekers looking {{to play a role}} in his administration.|$|E
6000|$|A game of {{pool was}} beginning, {{and the room}} was full of men. Holden entered, eager to get to the light and the company <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellows,</b> singing at the top <b>of</b> <b>his</b> voice-- ...|$|R
60|$|A dozen <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellows</b> were astir on the forecastle, looking eagerly ahead, and {{the sound}} of their voices and {{laughter}} reached him across the length of the stately Cinco Llagas.|$|R

5|$|Aside {{from his}} death, remarkably {{little is known}} of Cooke's circumstances. Even his date of birth is unclear, and unlike many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well {{respected}} in his profession and following his death {{was the subject of}} tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in St Paul's Cathedral and his local church in Wiltshire.|$|E
5|$|Chopin's qualities as {{a pianist}} and {{composer}} were recognized by many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> musicians. Schumann named {{a piece for}} him in his suite Carnaval, and Chopin later dedicated his Ballade No. 2 in F major to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works. Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by Chopin's death.|$|E
5|$|Cott's {{account of}} all this (illustrated by his own pen and ink drawings) is the 550-page book Adaptive Coloration in Animals (1940). It was proof-read by Kerr, who commented on its {{publication}} 'It {{is by far the}} finest thing of the kind in existence'. His co-workers' first-hand accounts of his work in military camouflage {{can be found in the}} memoirs of two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> camoufleurs: Julian Trevelyan and Roland Penrose.|$|E
50|$|As {{soon as he}} came to power, he was {{far from}} meeting the {{patriotic}} and democratic expectations <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellows,</b> concerned primarily with his family economical position while avoiding French occupants offence.|$|R
60|$|And the ape who {{recalled}} this wise counsel {{repeated it}} to several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellows,</b> {{so that when}} Terkoz returned to the tribe that day he found a warm reception awaiting him.|$|R
5000|$|What was {{the purpose}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pilgrimage,Whatever shape it took in Crispin's mind,If not, {{when all is}} said, to drive awayThe shadow <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellows</b> from the skies,And, from their stale {{intelligence}} released,To make a new intelligence prevail? ...|$|R
5|$|Fan {{attention}} {{became so}} intense that Tolkien had to take his phone number {{out of the public}} directory, and eventually he and Edith moved to Bournemouth, which was then a seaside resort patronized by the British upper middle class. Tolkien's status as a best-selling author gave them easy entry into polite society, but Tolkien deeply missed the company <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> Inklings. Edith, however, was overjoyed to step into the role of a society hostess, which had been the reason that Tolkien selected Bournemouth in the first place.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} as governor, Powell {{was elected to}} the U.S. Senate. Before he could assume office, President James Buchanan {{dispatched}} Powell and Major Benjamin McCulloch to Utah to ease tensions with Brigham Young and the Mormons. Powell assumed his Senate seat on his return from Utah, just prior to the election of Abraham Lincoln as president. Powell became an outspoken critic of Lincoln's administration, {{so much so that the}} Kentucky General Assembly asked for his resignation and some <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> senators tried to have him expelled from the body. Both groups later renounced their actions.|$|E
5|$|Glenn (Steven Yeun) and T-Dog (IronE Singleton) {{journey to}} the Greene home. There, Glenn begins to pray for the {{well-being}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellow</b> survivors, while T-Dog receives medical treatment for blood poisoning. Meanwhile Carl goes {{in and out of}} consciousness, and briefly recalls his encounter with the deer before going into a seizure. A distraught Lori opines to Rick about ending Carl's suffering, but Rick insists on keeping him alive.|$|E
6000|$|... "The etherealists {{maintain}} {{that there is}} no such thing as matter--that all is mind. They say that none of us exists, except in the imagination <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellows,</b> other than as an intangible, invisible mentality.|$|R
60|$|The rat-faced one, finding {{he was not}} dead, had {{regained his}} composure, and with a volley of oaths {{directed}} at Clayton refused in the name <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellows</b> to allow the young man any firearms.|$|R
60|$|Then the {{unexpected}} happened. A still heavier club was swung. In the pause that ensued, the gambler, who had scented a speculation {{and formed a}} syndicate with several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>fellows,</b> bid sixteen thousand dollars.|$|R
