40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{propagation}} of input data errors {{through the application of}} Helmert orthometric, normal and normal-orthometric height corrections to differential levelling observations, these being the three principal height systems in practical use around the world. Height corrections are required to remove the systematic error resulting from the geometric non-parallelism of the Earth's equipotential surfaces, but different height systems propagate errors differently. These systematic errors are thus present within levelling networks and subsequently in local vertical datums. Here, we show that the Helmert <b>orthometric</b> <b>correction</b> is sensitive to errors in the mean value of gravity along the plumbline, particularly for heights above 1000 m. The normal correction is much less sensitive due to the use of normal gravity along the normal plumbline. The normal <b>orthometric</b> <b>correction</b> of Rapp (1961) is largely insensitive to such errors, but it does not properly correct for the non-parallelism of the Earth's equipotential surfaces. Information showing the circumstances under which survey practitioners should apply height corrections to levelling lines is provided, demonstrating that normal-orthometric corrections only need be applied to class LC levelling lines that are to be used for large levelling networks extending in the north-south direction, particularly at high elevations...|$|E
40|$|The normal orthometric {{corrections}} {{used in the}} 1971 {{establishment of}} the Australian Height Datum (AHD) do not properly account for local variations in the Earth?s gravity field. Therefore, Helmert orthometric heights have been computed over a spirit-levelled height traverse over part of the Darling Fault and compared with normal orthometric heights. This involves a measured height change of ~ 175 m, a measured gravity change of ~ 34 mGal, and an estimated change in topographic mass-density of 480 kgm- 3. The computed Helmert <b>orthometric</b> <b>correction</b> reaches - 4. 8 mm between the end-points of the traverse, whereas the normal <b>orthometric</b> <b>correction</b> only reaches 0. 1 mm. However, computing the corrections over each bay in the traverse gives totals over the entire traverse of - 0. 8 mm for the Helmert orthometric corrections and 0. 2 mm for the normal orthometric corrections. A difference of 0. 1 mm was observed between the Helmert orthometric corrections computed with constant and variable topographic mass-density models. It is recommended that orthometric corrections, which take into account observed gravity and topographic mass-density, be considered in any future redefinition of the AHD...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Vertical {{reference}} systems based on national precise levelling net-works have been realised in Europe since the 1860 ’s. The heights {{are related to}} gravity, which by convention may be measured values or a model. The Norwegian Height System was adjusted in 1956 when {{the southern part of}} the country had been levelled once. Because of the lack of measured gravity, Clairaut’s formula for gravity was used in the <b>orthometric</b> <b>correction.</b> The intention was to establish an orthometric height system, but this was never tested or confirmed. In the literature the system is often referred to as or-thometric, but sometimes as normal orthometric. This study shows that the Norwegian Height System was realised by a strongly deformed net due to lack of land uplift corrections. The derived heights are neither normal nor orthometric. When the land uplift is handled in a proper way, the heights are close to normal heights. The remaining small differences are shown to depend on the free air anomaly. Key words.

40|$|Today one of {{the open}} {{problems}} from the geodetic {{point of view is}} the determination of a geometric (and not physical) reference system that allow the harmonisation of the altimetric reference systems at continental scale. Trying to solve this problem at European level, {{one of the}} goal of the IAG Inter-Commission Project 1. 2 is to provide the fundamentals for the installation of a unified european vertical reference frame. The EVRS (European Vertical Reference System) is a zero-tidal gravity-related height reference system, based on normal heights. Today all people use and know the orthometric heights, not the normal ones. So the goal is to move from the first one to the second one. In order to have correct normal heights {{the first step is to}} have correct orthometric heights: that does not always happen in the sense that if the <b>orthometric</b> <b>corrections</b> are not applied to the heights determined by high-precision leveling, it is not possible a correct unification of the reference systems. Within the HELIDEM (HELvetia-Italy Digital Elevation Model) project, among whose aims is to unify the reference systems between Italy and Switzerland with regard to regions involved in the Project, it was decided to analyze whether the <b>orthometric</b> <b>corrections</b> obtained for this area, considering a global model of geoid undulation (EGM 2008), were sufficient to correct the elevations determined by static GNSS surveys carried out by Politecnico di Torino and Istituto Geografico Militare (IGM). In order to achieve the objectives of the project mentioned above, it was necessary to perform GNSS static campaigns on benchmarks of the Italian geodetic reference network that were subsequently leveled with high-precision leveling. The considered benchmarks are settled in the Piedmont area and were chosen in the way that the height difference between two adjacent vertices was limited mainly to reduce elevation waste errors resulting from static GNSS measurements. Both dynamic and <b>orthometric</b> <b>corrections</b> have been computed in order to finally get geopotential numbers, normal heights and orthometric heights from raw levelling increments. In order to complete and make the analysis more significant, some measured gravity values were also considered for the estimation of the <b>orthometric</b> <b>corrections,</b> in order to compare these results with those previously described. This analysis showed that the measured gravity values well agree with those obtained from the EGM 2008 up to 800 - 1000 meters of altitude, since the values of <b>orthometric</b> <b>corrections</b> obtained in both cases are quite agree (the order of magnitude of the differences are centimeters...|$|R
40|$|Levelling {{increments}} must {{be corrected}} for gravity {{in order to}} get proper dynamic or orthometric heights. In Italy, most of the levelling lines have no associated gravity observations. Thus, only levelling increments are available, and corrections were computed only on a subset of the existing lines. However, gravity is densely observed, and thus, predictions of gravity along the levelling lines can be computed. This, in principle, would allow the estimation of corrections along the whole Italian levelling network. Furthermore, global model-derived gravity could be used for the same task (e. g. one could use the EGM 2008 global geopotential model to get gravity estimates). To check for the reliability of these procedures, a test has been performed along levelling lines in the western Alps area. Both dynamic and <b>orthometric</b> <b>corrections</b> have been computed in order to finally get geopotential numbers, normal heights and orthometric heights from raw levelling increments. The results proved that reliable results can be obtained using the Italian gravity database, while predictions based on the EGM 2008 model led to poorer estimates...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} normal-orthometric {{correction}} {{used in the}} definition of the Australian Height Datum, and also computes and evaluates normal and Helmert <b>orthometric</b> <b>corrections</b> for the Australian National Levelling Network (ANLN). Testing these corrections in Australia is important to establish which height system is most appropriate for any new Australian vertical datum. An approximate approach to assigning gravity values to ANLN benchmarks (BMs) is used, where the EGM 2008 -modelled gravity field is used to "re-construct" observed gravity at the BMs. Network loop closures (for first- and second-order levelling) indicate reduced misclosures for all height corrections considered, particularly in the mountainous regions of south eastern Australia. Differences between Helmert orthometric and normal-orthometric heights reach 44 cm in the Australian Alps, and differences between Helmert orthometric and normal heights are about 26 cm in the same region. Normal orthometric heights differ from normal heights by up to 18 cm in mountainous regions > 2, 000 m. This indicates that the quasigeoid is not compatible with normal-orthometric heights in Australia...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the approximately linear relation between free-air anomalies and topographic heights in Taiwan Island. The resulting statistics {{shows that there}} is not a significant linear relation in plain regions, and a strongly, significant linear relation in mountainous regions between the free-air anomalies and elevations. There are 15 independently observed gravity values were used to check the correlation and evaluate the accuracy of prediction. It has been found that the differences between observed and predicted free-air (or bouguer) gravity anomalies in mountainous regions have a mean and standard deviation of - 2. 23 +/- 9. 95 mgals. The global geopotential free-air anomalies on GRS 80 for Taiwan Island have also been predicted using the OSU 91 A geopotential coefficient set up to degree and order 360. Comparisons have been made between these free-air anomalies determined from the OSU 91 A 1 F geopotential coefficient set, and terrestrial point gravity anomalies. It has also been found that the mean difference between the OSU 91 A model derived anomalies and 243 actual point free-air anomalies is 16. 8 mgal with a root mean square error of 48 mgal. The significantly linear relation, between free-air anomalies and elevations in mountainous regions, obtained from this study can help to predict the needed gravity anomalies for rigorous <b>orthometric</b> <b>correction</b> used in precise leveling of Taiwan Island...|$|E
30|$|The local {{vertical}} datum in Japan {{is based on}} the Helmert’s approximation of mean gravity along the plumbline. However, determination of a rigorous orthometric height requires that the integral-mean value of gravity along the plumbline between the geoid and the Earth surface has to be known precisely. An attempt has been made to obtain rigorous orthometric heights at 816 GPS/levelling points distributed over four main islands of Japan (Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu) by applying corrections to the Helmert <b>orthometric</b> heights. The <b>corrections</b> to Helmert <b>orthometric</b> heights are evaluated from the differences between the integral-mean gravity and the approximate mean gravity along the plumbline. The <b>corrections</b> to Helmert <b>orthometric</b> heights vary from − 30.9  cm to 0.0  cm with a mean value of − 0.4  cm and standard deviation of ± 1.7  cm. An improved high-resolution gravimetric geoid model covering four main islands of Japan from our previous study is used to compare the consistency of the two height systems to a regionally defined gravimetric geoid model. The standard deviation of the differences between gravimetric and GPS/levelling geoid undulations is ± 7.5  cm, when Helmert orthometric heights are used. The standard deviation of the differences between gravimetric and GPS/levelling geoid undulations reduces to ± 7.3  cm, when rigorous orthometric heights are used. This indicates that rigorous orthometric heights are more consistent with the gravimetric geoid model than Helmert orthometric heights.|$|R
