5|$|In 1720, Squire Boone, {{who worked}} {{primarily}} as a weaver and a blacksmith, married Sarah Morgan (1700–77). Sarah's family were Quakers from Wales, and had settled in 1708 in the area which became Towamencin Township <b>of</b> <b>Montgomery</b> County. In 1731, the Boones moved to the Oley Valley, near the modern city of Reading. There they built a log cabin, partially preserved today as the Daniel Boone Homestead. Daniel Boone was born there, the sixth of eleven children.|$|E

5|$|Montgomery had {{previously}} suggested {{the appearance of}} Mayweather's parents {{at the end of}} season one, and was pleased to see them introduced. Several sets to create the Horizon were created on a soundstage, with the related scenes filmed {{in the second half of}} the episode's shoot after the main cast were dismissed, with the exception <b>of</b> <b>Montgomery.</b> Critical response was mixed, and the episode received the lowest ratings for a first-run episode of the series so far, viewed by 3.36 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|On January 25, 1776, Congress {{approved}} {{the establishment of}} a monument in memory <b>of</b> <b>Montgomery.</b> A state memorial service was also scheduled and carried out on February 19, 1776. Throughout the colonies, Montgomery was viewed as a hero, and Patriots tried to use his death to promote their cause in the war. Montgomery's name was used very often in literature; among the authors who used his name was Thomas Paine.|$|E
5|$|Pantulf {{was from}} Noron in the Calvados region of Normandy.

There is a separate dining room and bar/lounge area in the restaurant. The dining room has low-slung beams, and an open brick fireplace, around which are placed Laura Ashley sofas. The chestnut wood flooring of the restaurant was created from a fallen tree on the Francis family farm. There is room to serve up to 40 diners, with 12 members of staff working there. There are three en-suite rooms available to hire on a hotel basis.|$|E
5|$|After {{playing their}} {{previous}} game at Birmingham's Lakeview Park, the city <b>of</b> <b>Montgomery</b> gave Alabama and the Agricultural & Mechanical College of Alabama (now known as Auburn University) $500 to play {{each other at}} Riverside Park. In the second edition of what has since {{become known as the}} Iron Bowl, Auburn won 40–16. Auburn scored first when Rufus Dorsey scored on a 10-yard touchdown run and kicked the extra point for a 6–0 lead. Alabama responded on their next possession when John Burgett scored on a 35-yard touchdown run. However G. H. Kyser missed the extra point and Auburn still held a 6–4 lead. Auburn then extended their lead to 18–4 at halftime after a pair of touchdown from J. C. Dunham.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor was}} that, in early May 1944, an {{uncontrolled}} agent based in Spain (who sold fictional intelligence to the Germans) had passed on {{details of a}} meeting in Gibraltar between several high-ranking Allied officers. Documents found after the war indicate that the Germans found this information suspect, and may have treated Montgomery's appearance as equally so. Although double agents received several urgent requests from the Abwehr about his whereabouts {{it does not appear}} that this information was passed on to the German command in France. According to captured enemy generals, German intelligence believed that it was Montgomery, though they still guessed that it was a feint. The Bodyguard deception had confused the German command as to Allied intentions and the apparent arrival <b>of</b> <b>Montgomery</b> in Gibraltar added little to the picture.|$|E
50|$|Cloverdale {{has been}} one <b>of</b> <b>Montgomery's</b> choice {{residential}} areas {{since the turn of}} the century. It is one <b>of</b> <b>Montgomery's</b> earliest suburbs and is the oldest landscape garden designed residential area in Alabama, predating similar areas in Birmingham. Its short existence as an incorporated village (1910-1927) gave it a special sense of neighborhood, which it has retained to some degree to the present day.|$|R

5|$|As {{it turned}} out, the {{relationship}} between SHAEF and Field Marshal Sir Bernard Montgomery's 21st Army Group was far from cordial, with the Deputy Supreme Commander, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, and the Deputy Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Frederick Morgan, both frequently critical <b>of</b> <b>Montgomery.</b> In September 1944 an intelligence crisis similar to Kasserine arose, when the cryptanalysts at Bletchley Park did not locate the 9th SS Panzer Division Hohenstaufen and 10th SS Panzer Division Frundsberg in the Arnhem area, but information from the Dutch resistance and a consequent photo reconnaissance ordered by Major Brian Urquhart, the Intelligence Officer at I Airborne Corps, confirmed the German presence. Strong and Smith then flew to Brussels to warn Montgomery. However, Montgomery decided to accept the risk rather than alter the plans for Operation Market Garden.|$|E
5|$|His 1952 {{paper on}} the subject, {{together}} with a paper published concurrently by Deane Montgomery and Leo Zippin, solves affirmatively the restricted version of Hilbert's fifth problem, showing that indeed every locally Euclidean group is a Lie group. Gleason's contribution was to prove that this is true when G has the no small subgroups property; Montgomery and Zippin showed every locally Euclidean group has this property. As Gleason told the story, the key insight of his proof was to apply the fact that monotonic functions are differentiable almost everywhere. On finding the solution, he took a week of leave to write it up, and it was printed in the Annals of Mathematics alongside the paper <b>of</b> <b>Montgomery</b> and Zippin; another paper a year later by Hidehiko Yamabe removed some technical side conditions from Gleason's proof.|$|E
5|$|Llywelyn ap Gruffudd enjoyed an {{advantageous}} {{situation in}} the aftermath of the Barons' War. Through the 1267 Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Montgomery,</b> he officially obtained land he had conquered in the Four Cantrefs of Perfeddwlad and was recognised in his title of Prince of Wales. Armed conflicts nevertheless continued, in particular with certain dissatisfied Marcher Lords, such as Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, Roger Mortimer and Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford. Problems were exacerbated when Llywelyn's younger brother Dafydd and Gruffydd ap Gwenwynwyn of Powys, after failing in an assassination attempt against Llywelyn, defected to the English in 1274. Citing ongoing hostilities and the English king's harbouring of his enemies, Llywelyn refused to do homage to Edward. For Edward, a further provocation came from Llywelyn's planned marriage to Eleanor, daughter of Simon de Montfort.|$|E

5|$|The Edwardian castles {{and town}} walls in Gwynedd were {{built as a}} {{consequence}} of the wars fought for the control of Wales in the late 13th century. The kings of England and the Welsh princes had vied for control of the region since the 1070s, with Norman and English nobles and settlers slowly expanding their territories over several centuries. In the 1260s, however, the Welsh leader Llywelyn ap Gruffudd exploited a civil war between Henry III and rebel barons in England to become the dominant power, and was formally recognised as the prince of Wales under the Treaty <b>of</b> <b>Montgomery.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mall was {{initially}} a huge success, but its popularity declined as new retail outlets in Little Rock drew customers away. Then {{the departure of}} its anchor stores, beginning with the bankruptcy <b>of</b> <b>Montgomery</b> Ward in 2001, left {{more than half the}} building empty. Throughout the 1990s, the mall steadily declined as retailers and customers left. Due to the waning popularity and litigation involving the deterioration of the building, the mall was sold in 2007 to Strode Property Company, and the remaining few tenants were told to vacate. Demolition began for the primary structure in early 2008. Prior to this, associated buildings were razed beginning in December 2007, starting with the former Montgomery Ward auto center, as well as the former JCPenney auto center, which had been used several years as an automotive maintenance facility for the City of Little Rock.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{has been}} part of a state route since 1924 when it became part of New York State Route8, a road {{continuing}} northeast through Middletown and Montgomery to Newburgh. NY8 was split into two routes as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, with the portion of the highway south <b>of</b> <b>Montgomery</b> becoming New York State Route84. When Interstate84 (I-84) was built along a similar alignment to NY84 in the mid-1960s, the state route was renumbered again in May1966 to prevent confusion between the two roads. The section of NY84 south of Slate Hill was redesignated as NY284 {{while the rest of the}} highway was absorbed by other, pre-existing routes.|$|E
