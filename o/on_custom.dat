5|$|Coke {{used his}} role in Parliament as a leading {{opposition}} MP to attack patents, a system he had already criticised as a judge. Historically, English patent law was based <b>on</b> <b>custom</b> and the common law, not on statute. It began as the Crown granted patents {{as a form of}} economic protection to ensure high industrial production. As gifts from the Crown, there was no judicial review, oversight or consideration, and no actual law concerning patents. To boost England's economy, Edward II began encouraging foreign workmen and inventors to settle in England, offering letters of protection that protected them from guild policy on the condition that they train English apprentices and pass on their knowledge. The letters did not grant a full monopoly; rather they acted as a passport, allowing foreign workers to travel to England and practice their trade. This process continued for three centuries, with formal procedures set out in 1561 to issue letters patent to any new industry, allowing monopolies. The granting of these patents was highly popular with the monarch because of the potential for raising revenue; a patentee was expected to pay heavily for the patent, and unlike a tax raise (another method of raising Crown money) any public unrest {{as a result of the}} patent was normally directed at the patentee, not the monarch.|$|E

Usually the track for such a system is broken up into several sections (usually three) and the system automatically generates scores based on speed, angle and fluidity of the driver in each section, combining the scores for the final score. In certain situations judges can change or overrule a score, which happens, though rarely.|$|E

25|$|With the {{accession}} of Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar to the Iranian throne, the Qajar dynasty consolidated {{the central}} power. However, the Qajar Shahs, in particular Naser al-Din Shah Qajar (r. 1848–1896), whose reign paralleled {{that of the}} Ottoman Sultans of the Tanzimat time, failed at obtaining central control over the ulama. The Shiite scholars retained their political influence on the Persian society. They also maintained unrestricted access to the financial resources from the religious endowments. In addition, the Islamic Zakat tax was paid to individual imams and not to state-sponsored tax collectors. Both their religious influence and their financial means allowed the Shiite ulama to act, at times, against the Shah. Thus, under the Qajar dynasty, the ulama provided a source of religious legitimacy and served as interpreters of religious law in a dual legal system where the state administered law based <b>on</b> <b>custom</b> (ʻurf).|$|E
25|$|Custom games enable {{players to}} have open or private games with several {{possible}} options {{that can be}} adjusted, such as match length, which maps to play, limitations on character selection, and similar options {{that are used to}} create the Weekly Brawl or Arcade matches. When custom games were first launched, players did not gain any experience from playing in custom games as they would in the causal, ranked, or weekly brawl modes. A February 2017 update allows experience to be earned from custom games. This same patch also added several more customization features, including support for the Capture the Flag mode, and provided a server browser that can filter on the various feature sets. Some alterations of custom server modes have been made since the February 2017 update to prevent players from farming for experience points while they are idle <b>on</b> <b>custom</b> servers while Blizzard plans to ban users that attempt to farm experience via idling.|$|E

Newcomer MPC (Model Products Corporation) entered the arena in 1964 with their Corvette kit, {{followed}} by 1965 promotionals of the Dodge car line. Plastic model makers like Pyro Plastics Corporation and Premier Products came and went, while other kit makers focused on different vehicles. Lindberg rarely touched the promo market. Monogram focused <b>on</b> <b>custom,</b> hot rod, TV, movie, racing cars, aircraft, and ships. Revell did U.S. vehicles, but focused on European Sports and racing cars. Aurora Plastics Corporation specialized in aircraft, TV, classic Universal Monsters & figure kits. Aurora also made a large range of 1:32 scale and a several 1:25 scale car kits. Palmer Plastics sold a number of American 1:32 scale car models for 98 cents each throughout the 1960s, but these models were poorly detailed and lacked basic features such as clear windows and correct wheel covers.|$|E
