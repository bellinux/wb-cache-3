50|$|An <b>offset</b> <b>well</b> is an {{existing}} wellbore {{that may be}} used as a guide for planning a well. Many offsets could be referred to in the planning of a well, to identify subsurface geology and pressures. <b>Offset</b> <b>well</b> data may be combined with seismic data and prior experience. Where offset data is lacking, well planners will be more conservative, allowing for a greater range of contingencies and expenses.|$|E
50|$|As well {{planning}} becomes more complex, regulated and expensive, access to <b>offset</b> <b>well</b> data becomes increasingly important for {{well planning}} and benchmarking.|$|E
50|$|High quality <b>offset</b> <b>well</b> data {{is highly}} sought after by {{planners}} for optimizing their designs, {{and is also}} used retrospectively to benchmark performance. Offset data from competing companies is particularly coveted but very hard to obtain due to a profound reluctance by oil and gas operators to share their offset data with competitors.|$|E
30|$|The <b>offset</b> <b>wells</b> {{which show}} the {{pressure}} match were located 50 – 60  km {{away from the}} Atharamura and located in different tectonic environments. It is also observed {{that most of the}} wells which show the pressure match have been located in the western side of the Atharamura.|$|R
30|$|To {{estimate}} {{the reliability and}} to understand the subsurface fluid flow, the predicted pressure values at CDPs are compared with pore pressure measured by RFT (repeat formation tester) from drilled <b>offset</b> <b>wells.</b> In this comparison study, total number of 14 well’s RFT data were taken and out of these 8 wells had over-pressures.|$|R
30|$|Productivity {{background}} of a well: by investigating the previous status of good productivity and its comparison with the adjacent drilled wells in the field, it gives engineers the chance to estimate more accurately and in some occasions may lead to decline in the acidizing procedures regarding the previous experiences of <b>offset</b> <b>wells.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Rushmore Reviews is {{a company}} based in Aberdeen, Scotland that collects, {{analyzes}} and publishes <b>offset</b> <b>well</b> data for participating Operators in the oil industry. The content of their extensive, global database is exclusively available to Review participants, who are then {{able to use the}} shared data to benchmark their own performance against others in the industry.|$|E
50|$|In an {{increasingly}} competitive industry, benchmarking has grown popular amongst {{oil and gas}} Operators, explaining why participation in the Rushmore Reviews has grown steadily. The dataset contains {{a large amount of}} <b>offset</b> <b>well</b> data encompassing drilling, completions, shale, interventions and abandonments. As of 2013, the Reviews contain data for over 50,000 wells, from conventional hydrocarbon to shale and coal seam gas wells. Over 100 countries feature in the Reviews, {{and the vast majority of}} Operating companies have made contributions.|$|E
50|$|Participants of the Reviews are {{provided}} with secure website access in order to view <b>offset</b> <b>well</b> data. The data is searchable and can be filtered by the user. The data may also be downloaded in Excel format. Additionally there are a range of analytical tools available to study the data. These include performance metrics (P10, P25, P50, P75, P90, Min, Mean, Max etc.) {{as well as the}} facility to draw a range of different chart types.|$|E

This {{was part of}} the strategy of Dabney and Lloyd to develop the field in an [...] "orderly" [...] manner. Indeed, both Associated and Shell cooperated in maximizing the long-term output of the field, which to date has produced almost one billion barrels of crude oil.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to present results of {{previously}} performed fracture treatments in the geothermal research well GtGrSk 4 / 05 at GroB Schonebeck. The fracture treatments included three hydraulic stimulations, two in the sandstone section of the Lower Permian {{and one in the}} volcanic section. In low permeable volcanic rocks we performed a cyclic waterfrac treatment over 6 days in conjunction with adding low sand concentrations. Flow rates of up to 150 1 /s were realized with a total amount of injected water of 13170 m Monitoring water level in the <b>offsetting</b> <b>well</b> EGrSk 3 / 90, which is 475 m apart at the final depth, showed a very rapidly water level increase due to the stimulation treatment. A possible explanation might be a fault zone in the volcanic rocks. It was known from previous treatments in the <b>offsetting</b> <b>well</b> that high permeable sandstones do not show a self propping effect, hence we performed two gel proppant treatments in these sandstones to maintain long-term access to the reservoir. A total amount of 100 to of high strength proppants with 500 m 3 of cross-linked gel were injected during each treatment. The subsequent production test in conjunction with flowmeter logging showed the success of the treatments...|$|R

50|$|In 1996 {{there was}} a {{breakthrough}} in the drilling and extended well testing (EWT) of well #206/8-10z. The EWT {{was followed by the}} side-tracking of an <b>offset</b> <b>well</b> into the pressure sink created by the EWT. The 1996 well test results set the scope for the 1997 drilling programme and triggered interest in a first phase of development. Two further wells were drilled in 1997 to appraise the 'Graben' and '3A' segments to reduce uncertainty in these areas adjacent to the core area.|$|E
50|$|Microseismic {{monitoring}} techniques, using {{very sensitive}} microphones and tilt meters can monitor {{the growth of}} fractures in the target formation in real time. This can be done using a surface array, or, {{if there is a}} nearby <b>offset</b> <b>well,</b> using downhole microphones. This means that the engineers can modify the pump rate based upon the growth of the fractures, and stop pumping if there is evidence of vertical migration into faults. This technology is available from many big oilfield service companies.|$|E
50|$|Site 4 is an 80 m long dolmen. It {{originally}} had about 100 external stones, 14 {{of which are}} still in situ, the remainder were put back during its restoration (some with dry stone walling filling the gaps). The passage grave consisted of a roughly 8 m long chamber with 12 upright supporting stones {{and a pair of}} passageway stones. The original five capstones of the chamber as well as the capstone for the passage are missing. The location of the chamber in the dolmen is right at the end, likewise the side entrance to the chamber is <b>offset</b> <b>well</b> to the end, so that the site is classified as one of the so-called Holsteiner Kammer ("Holstein Chamber") type.|$|E
50|$|The RDI is an {{analytical}} tool based on Rushmore Reviews extensive global drilling database of <b>offset</b> <b>wells,</b> {{and is available}} to oil and gas companies who participate in the Reviews. The index is an entirely objective tool, and essentially estimates the speed {{it will take to}} drill a well after the user supplies the equation with 8-10 characteristics. The drilling speed is converted into an index number, ranging from 10 (easiest) to over 200 (most difficult). The resulting RDI number can then be used as a point of reference for well planning.|$|R
50|$|The {{participants}} meet {{annually in}} Aberdeen {{to consider the}} Reviews and discuss/agree upon any revisions they require for the following year, ensuring that the Reviews continue to evolve and grow. 1994 saw {{the establishment of the}} Completions Performance Review (CPR), now containing information and schematics on the completion of over 12,000 <b>offset</b> <b>wells</b> in over 60 countries. Following an increasing number of well abandonments, demand grew among participants for the Abandonment Performance Review (APR) which began in 2008. The APR contains data for over 300 permanently abandoned wells, mainly situated in Europe.|$|R

30|$|The {{molecular}} weight {{can be calculated}} from gas-specific gravity. Gas-specific gravity can be calculated from shut-in drillpipe pressure, shut-in casing pressure, mud density, and pit gain, or from <b>offset</b> <b>well</b> gas property. Bottomhole temperature and temperature at any depth can be estimated using regional temperature gradient. Gravity force of gas column is constant during the gas migration.|$|E
30|$|The Bredasdorp Basin {{consists}} of several {{oil and gas}} fields, amongst which is the K-R Field. Using <b>offset</b> <b>well</b> data along with various calibration sources, a 2 D geomechanical model was built, allowing for an estimation of the overburden gradient, pore pressure gradient and fracture gradient for future wells drilled in the field. A significant part of this model involves calibration which incorporates operational observations to fit the geopressure curves to actual drilling incidents. The current model that was built is quite a reliable estimate, and as previously mentioned, the inclusion of more offset wells will yield a more accurate prediction of the safe drilling mud window for the K-R field.|$|E
30|$|From the {{literature}} available, it’s clear that Bower’s approach is more promising {{in predicting the}} pore pressure, but needs <b>offset</b> <b>well</b> data, effective stress data and extensive calibration to the graphical constants. On concerning the study area which starves of exploration, availability of data is the main constraint in selecting the prediction method. Presently, seismic velocity data at synclinal and flank part of the Atharamura are available. The Eaton’s method is used to predict pore pressure, and certain corrections are made to reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of the pore pressure. The general approach is to develop normal compaction curve {{for the formation of}} interest and comparing it with actual compaction curve and over-pressure is calculated in terms of deviation from normal trend. The development of normal compaction parameters plays a vital role in determining the reliability of the pore pressure prediction.|$|E

40|$|This project {{attempts}} {{to demonstrate the}} effectiveness of exploiting thin-layered, low-energy deposits at the distal margin of a prograding turbidite complex {{through the use of}} hydraulically-fractured, horizontal or high-angle wells. The combination of a horizontal or high-angle well and hydraulic fracturing will allow greater pay exposure than can be achieved with conventional vertical wells while maintaining vertical communication between thin interbedded layers and the wellbore. A high-angle well will be drilled in the fan margin portion of a slope-basin clastic reservoir and will be completed with multiple hydraulic-fracture treatments. Geologic modeling, reservoir characterization, and fine-grid reservoir simulation will be used to select the well location and orientation. Design parameters for the hydraulic fracture treatments will be determined by fracturing an existing test well.

A high-angle well will be drilled in the fan margin and will be completed with multiple hydraulic-fracture treatments.

40|$|Offshore {{drilling}} {{programs on}} complex reservoirs carry inherent risks. Subsurface uncertainty {{can lead to}} costly mistakes being made, and, therefore, being able to gain information {{during the course of}} a sequential drilling program, and use it effectively, can have sizeable capital importance. Based only on predicted drilling costs and production rates, wells closest to the platform would commonly be drilled before longer offset wells by virtue of their cheaper drilling costs. However, there is potential during the drilling program for learning to occur between the drilling of two wells that would either provide encouragement to go ahead and drill the second well, change it in some way, or, indeed, remove it from the program altogether. Analyzing the predicted value of this learning, before drilling commences, can reveal the conditions under which the longer <b>offset</b> <b>well</b> could be drilled first because of its potential to impact decisions regarding the second well. The various scenarios and their sensitivities are analyzed using a value of information (VoI) approach, providing an example of how VoI can be used proactively in the construction of learning drilling strategies. The same approach can be extended to most other data acquisition situations. Peter Cunningham, Steve Beg...|$|E

The fracture treatments included three hydraulic stimulations, two in the sandstone section of the Lower Permian (Upper Rotliegend) and one in the volcanic section (Lower Rotliegend). In the low permeable volcanic rocks we performed a cyclic waterfrac treatment over 6 days in conjunction with adding low sand concentrations. Flow rates of up to 150 l/s during the high stages were realized with a total amount of injected water of 13, 170 m. Monitoring the water level in the <b>offsetting</b> <b>well</b> EGrSk 3 / 90, which is 475 m apart at the final depth, showed a very rapidly water level increase due to the stimulation treatment. A possible explanation is a natural fracture system or a fault zone in the volcanic rocks, which connects the two boreholes via the new fractures.

30|$|One {{of the key}} inputs to {{successful}} well planning is accurate pore pressure profile and it is more challenging in frontier areas with complex geology and where few <b>offset</b> <b>wells</b> exist beyond known depths. Such situations have left practitioners with no other option than to adapt existing models for pore pressure prediction work, which in some cases have led to underbalanced drilling with its attendant problems. According to Swarbrick and Osborne (1998), most basins around the world such as the young deltaic shale sequence of Niger Delta are abnormally pressured due to: (1) stress-related mechanisms (tectonism and disequilibrium compaction); (2) fluid expansion due to hydrocarbon generation, mineral transformation, etc.; and (3) fluid movement and buoyancy mechanisms (hydraulic head, osmosis, buoyancy due to density contrasts and lateral transfer).|$|R
40|$|Pore {{pressure}} estimation is {{a crucial}} yet difficult problem in the oil industry. If unexpected overpressure is encountered while drilling it can result in costly challenges and leaked hydrocarbons. Prediction methods often use empirical porosity-based methods such as the Eaton ratio method, requiring an idealised normal compaction trend and using a single wireline log {{as a proxy for}} porosity. Such methods do not account for the complex and multivariate nature of the system, or for the many sources of uncertainty. We propose a Bayesian network approach for modelling pore pressure, using conditional probability distributions to capture the joint behaviour of the quantities in the system (such as pressures, porosity, lithology, wireline logs). These distributions allow the inclusion of expert scientific information, for example a compaction model relating porosity to vertical effective stress and lithology is central to the model. The probability distribution for each quantity is updated in light of data, producing a prediction with uncertainty that takes into account the whole system, knowledge and data. Our method can be applied to a setting where an <b>offset</b> <b>well</b> is used to learn about the compaction behaviour of the planned well, and we demonstrate this with two wells from the Magnolia field...|$|E
30|$|Liquid {{nitrogen}} stimulation {{has been}} increasing highlighted in recent year. Considerable amount of experiments, field tests and numerical studies have been performed. Finnie et al. (1979) presented a calculation model for a semi-infinite slab cooled on its surface using liquid nitrogen and conducted experiment modelling limestone injected with liquid nitrogen. Grundmann et al. (1998) treated a Devonian shale well with cryogenic nitrogen and observed that the initial production rate increases by 8  % {{compared with that of}} a nearby <b>offset</b> <b>well</b> using traditional hydraulic fracturing. Liquid nitrogen has also been used for fracturing reconstruction of reservoirs with favorable stimulation effects (Mcdaniel et al. 1997). Ren et al. (2013) studied the effects of liquid nitrogen on coal-rock samples in thermal shock experiments and ultrasonic tests. The experimental results show that micro-fractures can be induced inside the coal-rock matrix due to liquid nitrogen shock. The dramatic reduction of sound velocity and amplitude implies that the liquid nitrogen treatment effectively affects the internal structure of the coal-rock samples. Cai et al. (2014 a, b) investigated the effects of liquid nitrogen cooling on rock pore structure. The results show that there are three major changes in the rock pore structure when the samples are cooled by liquid nitrogen: (1) a reduction in the number and volume of the pores; (2) an expansion of the micro-fissures (micro-pores); and (3) an increase in the pore scale.|$|E

40|$|Diagenetically altered mudstones compact {{mechanically}} and chemically. Consequently, {{their normal}} compaction trends depend upon their temperature history {{as well as}} on the maximum effective stress they have experienced. A further complication is that mudstones are commonly overpressured where clay diagenesis occurs, preventing direct observation of the hydrostatic normal compaction trend. A popular way to estimate pore pressure in these circumstances is to calculate the sonic normal compaction trend in a well with a known pressure–depth profile by applying Eaton's method in reverse, and then to estimate pore pressure in <b>offset</b> <b>wells</b> using Eaton's method conventionally. We tested this procedure for Cretaceous mudstones at Haltenbanken. The results were inconsistent because the sonic log responds differently to disequilibrium compaction overpressure and unloading overpressure, and their relative contributions vary across the basin. In theory, a two-step method using the density and sonic logs could estimate the contributions to overpressure from disequilibrium compaction and unloading. The normal compaction trend for density should be the normal compaction trend at the maximum effective stress the mudstones have experienced, not at hydrostatic effective stress. We advocate the Budge-Fudge approach as a starting point for pore pressure estimation in diagenetically altered mudstones, a two-step method that requires geological input to help estimate the overpressure contribution from disequilibrium compaction. In principle, the Budge-Fudge approach could be used to estimate the normal compaction trend for mudstones at the maximum effective stress they have experienced, and so form the basis of the full two-step method through the use of <b>offset</b> <b>wells.</b> Our initial efforts to implement the full two-step method in this way at Haltenbanken produced inconsistent results with fluctuations in estimated pore pressure reflecting some of the fluctuations in the density logs. We suspect that variations in the mineralogical composition of the mudstones are responsible...|$|R
