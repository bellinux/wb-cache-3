40|$|Abstract We {{identify}} a <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>timed</b> automata, {{which we call}} counter-free input-determinedautomata, which characterize the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>timed</b> languages definable by several timed temporal logics in the literature, including MTL [1, 11]. We make use ofthis characterization to show that MTL satisfies an &quot;ultimate stability &quot; property with respect to periodic sequences of timed words. Our results hold for both thepointwise and continuous semantics. Along the way we generalize the result of McNaughton-Papert [10] to show a counter-free automata characterization of FO-definable finitely varying functions. 1 Introduction A number <b>of</b> <b>classes</b> <b>of</b> <b>timed</b> automata based on &quot;input-determined &quot; distance operatorshave been proposed in the literature.

40|$|We {{consider}} a general <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>timed</b> automata parameterized {{by a set}} of “input-determined” operators, in a continuous time setting. We show that for any such set of operators, we have a monadic second order logic characterization <b>of</b> the <b>class</b> <b>of</b> <b>timed</b> languages accepted by the corresponding <b>class</b> <b>of</b> automata. Further, we consider natural timed temporal logics based on these operators, and show that they are expressively equivalent to the first-order fragment of the corresponding MSO logics. As a corollary of these general results we obtain an expressive completeness result for the continuous version of MTL...|$|R
