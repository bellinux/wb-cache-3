2500|$|Within a month, former {{president}} Jefferson offered {{to sell his}} personal library as a replacement. In January 1815, Congress accepted Jefferson's offer, appropriating $23,950 to purchase his 6,487 books. Some members of the House of Representatives opposed the outright purchase, including Daniel Webster, a New Hampshire representative who wanted to return [...] "all books of an atheistical, irreligious, and immoral tendency." [...] Jefferson had spent 50 years accumulating {{a wide variety of}} books in several languages and in many subjects, including philosophy, science, literature, architecture, law, religion, and mathematics. He had also collected books on topics not normally viewed as part of a legislative library, such as cookbooks. However, he believed all subjects had a place in the Library of Congress. He remarked:"I do not know that it contains any branch of science which Congress would wish to exclude from their collection; there is, in fact, no subject to which a Member of Congress may not have occasion to refer."Jefferson's collection was unique in that it was a working collection of a scholar, not a gentleman's collection for display. Jefferson's original collection was organized into a scheme based on Francis Bacon's <b>organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Specifically, he grouped his books into Memory, Reason, and Imagination, which broke down into 44 more subdivisions. The Library followed Jefferson's organization scheme until the late 19th century, when librarian Herbert Putnam began work on a more flexible Library of Congress Classification structure that now applies to more than 138 million items. In 1851, a fire destroyed two thirds of the Jefferson collection, with only 2,000 books remaining. In 2008, after working for ten years, the librarians at the Library of Congress had found replacements for all but 300 of the works that were in Jefferson's original collection.|$|E

40|$|The Jordan measure, the Jordan curve theorem, {{as well as}} {{the other}} generic {{references}} to Camille Jordan's (1838 - 1922) achievements highlight that the latter can hardly be reduced to the "great algebraist" whose masterpiece, the Traité des substitutions et des equations algébriques, unfolded the group-theoretical content of Évariste Galois's work. The present paper appeals to the database of the reviews of the Jahrbuch über die Fortschritte der Mathematik (1868 - 1942) for providing an overview of Jordan's works. On the one hand, we shall especially investigate the collective dimensions in which Jordan himself inscribed his works (1860 - 1922). On the other hand, we shall address the issue of the collectives in which Jordan's works have circulated (1860 - 1940). Moreover, the time-period during which Jordan has been publishing his works, i. e., 1860 - 1922, provides an opportunity to investigate some collective <b>organizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> that pre-existed the development of object-oriented disciplines such as group theory (Jordan-Hölder theorem), linear algebra (Jordan's canonical form), topology (Jordan's curve), integral theory (Jordan's measure), etc. At the time when Jordan was defending his thesis in 1860, it was common to appeal to transversal <b>organizations</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge,</b> such as what the latter designated as the "theory of order.

The full four volumes of Bibliographic Classification appeared from 1940-1953 and “marked {{half a century of}} sustained effort” by Bliss. Bliss’s reasons for developing this system were primarily because of his discontent with the Classification systems that were at use at the time. For example, Bliss says, “that The International Institute’s adoption of the Decimal Classification some 35 years ago, was for the specious reason that no better system was then available.” Bliss was emphatic about the fact that “good classification, ‘dignifies the library as an embodiment of knowledge.’” [...] The basis behind this system is the idea of a “subject approach to knowledge,” where books are ordered in a logical systematic way that is “intertwined with the <b>organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> in society.” Bliss stressed this relationship by saying “Organizations of Knowledge thus become organizations for thought.” In an article entitled [...] "The System of the Sciences and the Organization of Knowledge" [...] written by Bliss in the January issue Philosophy of Science from 1935, he outlines seven major “principles of classification for <b>organization</b> <b>of</b> <b>knowledge</b> and thought.” Briefly stated and explained, they are, ...|$|E
