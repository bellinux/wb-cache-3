25|$|The {{success of}} sound films stimulated {{the search for}} new {{applications}} of photocells. Various types of photocells were considered: vacuum, gas-discharge, photovoltaic and photoresistive, but the industry favored slow yet cheap selenium devices. By the mid-1930s, selenium photocells controlled assembly lines, elevators and looms. Fire alarms with selenium sensors came into mass production in the UK {{and then in the}} US. Norbert Wiener proposed, and Truman Gray built an <b>optical</b> <b>scanner</b> for inputting and processing data in analog computers. Kurt Kramer introduced a selenium photocell to medical research. In 1940, Glenn Milliken built the first practical selenium-based oximeter to monitor the physical condition of the Royal Air Force pilots. It was a RO where the light source and detector were separated by the ear lobe of the pilot.|$|E

50|$|Elections in South Korea use a central-count {{system with}} <b>optical</b> <b>scanners</b> at each {{regional}} election office. A separate ballot paper {{is used for}} each office being contested, and votes are cast using red ink and a rubber stamp. Ballots are similar in size to paper currency, and the <b>optical</b> <b>scanners</b> resemble cash sorter machines. After the ballots are sorted, stacks of ballots are counted using machines resembling currency counting machines. The Korean system has been praised {{as a model of}} best practice, but it has also been the subject of controversy, including questions about its legality and allegations of rigged counting in 2012.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} how {{to increase}} the manufacturing yields of CMOS Active Pixel Sensors and improve upon detectors of <b>optical</b> <b>scanners.</b> To increase manufacturing yields of APS, the APS is split into two subpixels, so that when {{one half of the}} pixel is defective, the entire APS will not fail. The other subpixel will still be functional and through current summing, a multiplication be used for recovery. Current <b>optical</b> <b>scanners</b> suffer from two drawbacks. The laser is at about the same intensity as the ambient illumination and local surface imperfections cause laser to be reflected at odd angles. To address this issue, the dual-output APS has been designed. It consists of one APS cell with two readout structures such that the background illumination is integrated on one side while the background and laser is integrated onto another side. A subtraction would reveal the laser in preference to the background...|$|R
