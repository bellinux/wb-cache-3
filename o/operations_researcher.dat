40|$|Busing of {{children}} to achieve racial balance in schools is an important and controversial social issue. In studying the school busing problem, various groups (e. g., <b>operations</b> <b>researchers,</b> educators, sociologists, psychologists) proceed quite differently because of their different "Weltanschauungen" [...] their different perceptions of reality, their different world views. <b>Operations</b> <b>researchers</b> have viewed the school busing problem as a desegregation problem (i. e., simply physically mixing the races) while others have seen it as an integration problem (i. e., helping {{to bring about a}} viable, multi-racial society). The usefulness of the desegregation view of <b>operations</b> <b>researchers</b> is evaluated in light of findings from the educational literature about various aspects of the school busing problem. Explicit attention by <b>operations</b> <b>researchers</b> to the concept of "Weltanschauung" should result in studies more useful to school officials and administrators. Statements made about the role of "Weltanschauung" in operations research studies of the school busing problem may be applied to operations research studies in other areas of social concern such as health, welfare, and law enforcement. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{reviews the}} main applications of statistics and operations research techniques to the quantitative aspects of Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, fulfilling a pressing need. Data Mining, {{one of the}} most important phases of the Knowledge Discovery in Databases activity, is becoming ubiquitous with the current information explosion. As a result, there is an increasing need for training professionals to work as analysts or to interface with these. On the other hand, such professionals already exist. Statisticians and <b>operations</b> <b>researchers</b> combine three skills widely used in Data Mining: computer applications, systems optimization and data analysis techniques. This review alerts them about the challenging opportunities that, with little extra training, await them in Data Mining. In addition, our review provides other Data Mining professionals, of different backgrounds, a clearer view about the capabilities that statisticians and <b>operations</b> <b>researchers</b> bring to Knowledge Discovery in Databases...|$|R
