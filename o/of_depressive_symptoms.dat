30|$|Participants {{in group}} 2 (n =  34) {{received}} individual counselling {{from one of}} the two trained pharmacists. Participants were scheduled to visit the community pharmacy. At week 0, the depression management handbook was provided to all participants for self-study. The handbook developed by a research team was comprised of three parts (a) an overview about <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> including definition, causes, risk factors <b>of</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> and self-managements, (b) a patient profile recording personal information and clinical symptoms, and (c) a form for patients to record their daily activities to relieve <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Participants received individual counseling at week 0, 4, 8, 16 from the same pharmacist. The counseling sessions lasted approximately 1  h and focused on finding the cause <b>of</b> <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> and method to relieve depressed mood.

Bicalutamide specifically may also be a safer drug than cyproterone acetate or spironolactone, as it has a much lower risk of hepatotoxicity relative to cyproterone acetate and, unlike spironolactone, has no risk of hyperkalemia or other antimineralocorticoid-associated adverse reactions. However, bicalutamide does have a very small risk of hepatotoxicity itself, as well as of interstitial pneumonitis.|$|E

40|$|Background Previously, we {{proposed}} a model for ordinal scale scoring in which individual thresholds for each item constitute a distribution by each item. This lead us to hypothesize that the boundary curves <b>of</b> each <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> score in the distribution <b>of</b> total <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> scores follow a common mathematical model, which is expressed {{as the product of}} the frequency <b>of</b> the total <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> scores and the probability of the cumulative distribution function of each item threshold. To verify this hypothesis, we investigated the boundary curves of the distribution <b>of</b> total <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> scores in a general population. Methods Data collected from 21, 040 subjects who had completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) questionnaire as part of a national Japanese survey were analyzed. The CES-D consists of 20 items (16 negative items and four positive items). The boundary curves of adjacent item scores in the distribution <b>of</b> total <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> scores for the 16 negative items were analyzed using log-normal scales and curve fitting. Results The boundary curves of adjacent item scores for a given symptom approximated a common linear pattern on a log normal scale. Curve fitting showed that an exponential fit had a markedly higher coefficient of determination than either linear or quadratic fits. With negative affect items, the gap between the total score curve and boundary curve continuously increased with increasing total <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> scores on a log-normal scale, whereas the boundary curves of positive affect items, which are not considered manifest variables of the latent trait, did not exhibit such increases in this gap. Discussion The {{results of the present study}} support the hypothesis that the boundary curves <b>of</b> each <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> score in the distribution <b>of</b> total <b>depressive</b> <b>symptom</b> scores commonly follow the predicted mathematical model, which was verified to approximate an exponential mathematical pattern...|$|R

40|$|This {{longitudinal}} study examined whether adolescent <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> were best predicted by sibling <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> or by perceived relationship quality (i. e. support, conflict and power) over time. We researched whether perceived sibling relationship quality moderated the effect <b>of</b> sibling <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> on adolescent <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Furthermore, we examined whether birth order, adolescent gender and dyadic gender composition moderated these effects. Across six waves, 412 Dutch adolescents (57 % boys; Mage = 13. 02, SDage =. 43) and their siblings reported {{on their own}} <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Adolescents also reported on perceived support, conflict and power from sibling. Crosslagged panel analyses showed that only sibling <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> predicted adolescent <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> over time. This longitudinal effect <b>of</b> sibling <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> on adolescent <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> was not moderated by perceived sibling relationship quality. Moreover, the longitudinal effects <b>of</b> sibling <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> and perceived relationship quality on adolescent <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> were not moderated by birth order, adolescent gender or dyadic gender composition.

The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale assessed <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms,</b> the Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire assessed the mother’s perception of bonding with the infant and mother-infant interactions were videotaped and analyzed with the Global Rating Scale. Results : Mothers with <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> were poorer, were less educated and rated lower infant bonding than mothers without <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> (p = 0. 03), yet objective observation revealed {{no difference between the}} two groups regarding maternal interactive behavior (p = 0. 57).

The results showed no main effect of the program on <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> at one-year follow-up. A moderation effect was found for parental psychopathology; adolescents who had parents with psychopathology and received the OVK program had less <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> compared to adolescents with parents with psychopathology in the control condition. No moderating effects on <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> were found for gender, ethnical background, and level <b>of</b> baseline <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms.</b> An iatrogenic effect of the intervention was found on the secondary outcome <b>of</b> clinical <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Based on the low level <b>of</b> reported <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms</b> at baseline, it seems that our sample might not meet the characteristics of a high-risk selective group for <b>depressive</b> <b>symptoms.</b> Therefore, no firm conclusions can be drawn about the selective potential of the OVK depression prevention program.
