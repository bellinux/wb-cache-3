5|$|The {{presence}} of a large, unusual creature in Muskrat Lake {{has been the subject}} of anecdotes since 1916. The creature's name was originally cited as Hapyxelor, alternately spelled Hapaxelor, but changed simply to Mussie, short for The Monster <b>of</b> <b>Muskrat</b> Lake, sometime later. Humphries, a man from Cobden, was a well-known proponent of Mussie's existence. Around the area, many people's knowledge of the creature come from his vehement, albeit inconsistent, tales of observing it once.|$|E

500|$|Muskrats {{provide an}} {{important}} food resource {{for many other}} animals, including [...] mink, foxes, coyotes, wolves, lynx, bears, eagles, snakes, alligators, and large owls and hawks.

Caribou and elk sometimes feed on the vegetation which makes up muskrat push-ups during the winter when other food is scarce for them. [...] In their introduced range in the former Soviet Union, the muskrat's greatest predator is the golden jackal. They can be completely eradicated in shallow water bodies, and {{during the winter of}} 1948–49 in the Amu Darya (river in central Asia), muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal faeces contents, and 71% <b>of</b> <b>muskrat</b> houses were destroyed by jackals, 16% of which froze and became unsuitable for muskrat occupation.

2500|$|Beginning at the {{southern}} end of the army base, Highway17 follows the Pembroke Bypass, bypassing west of Petawawa and Pembroke, where it intersects Highway41. The bypass ends at Renfrew County Road 40, north <b>of</b> <b>Muskrat</b> Lake. The highway then travels south through the town of Cobden. It follows a bypass east of Renfrew and meets Highway60. Highway17 curves east and passes north of Alexander Stewart Provincial Park. Approximately [...] east of Campbell Drive, just northwest of Arnprior, the highway divides and widens to four lanes, at which point Highway 417 begins. A disconnected section of the highway (known as Old Highway 17) still exists within the Ottawa Region between Regional Road 29 and Grants Side Rd, travelling directly parallel to Highway 417. However, it is likely to be downgraded and possibly absorbed as part of Regional Road 117.|$|E

We used BINPAS (Bioinvasion Impact/Biopollution Assessment System) for terrestrial ecosystems, which is usually using for water ecosystems, {{to assess the impact}} of Ondatra zibethicus on native species and communities, on habitats, on ecosystems and the biopollution level (BPL). The impact <b>of</b> <b>muskrats</b> varied between different regions of Lithuania.

40|$|Recent {{ecological}} theory {{predicts that}} change in population size {{is linked to}} the spatial and temporal variation in demographic performance of individuals. In particular, directional dispersal of individuals from prime to marginal habitats can regulate abundance in prime habitat, and influence local population size. However, few empirical studies have adequately tested all predictions of this spatially-dependent population model. The focus of my research was to measure the spatial and temporal variation in demography <b>of</b> a local <b>muskrat</b> population inhabiting a landscape with unequal suitability among habitats. First, I tested the hypothesis that water level limits population size and distribution <b>of</b> <b>muskrats</b> during the breeding period (May-October). Next, I measured nine nutrient-dependent, phenotypic variables <b>of</b> <b>muskrats</b> and one index of forage quality during the ice-free period. Data were used to test the hypothesis that differences in food resources limits the demographic performance <b>of</b> <b>muskrats</b> in marginal versus prime habitats (food limitation hypothesis, FLH). Lastly, I examined the spatial and temporal variation in demography among habitats during the breeding (May-October) and non-breeding (October-May) period. Specifically, I tested several predictions of the source-sink model. Water level strongly limits population size <b>of</b> <b>muskrats</b> by influencing adult and juvenile survival during the breeding and non-breeding period. Consequently, water level {{plays a major role in}} determining the abundance and distribution <b>of</b> <b>muskrats</b> among habitats. Differences in habitat suitability were primarily related to the survival rate of juveniles during the breeding period, and all individuals overwinter. Variation in demographic parameters indicated that residents of island shorelines (prime habitat) were less affected by the density-independent effects of water level than individuals occupying emergent vegetation (more marginal habitats). Since food resources could not be linked to habitat suitability, I hypothesize that spatial variation in predation risk is a key factor influencing habitat suitability in muskrats. Spacing behaviour plays an integral part in regulating the breeding density <b>of</b> <b>muskrats</b> in prime habitat. At the local level, population dynamics appears to result from the interaction of spacing behaviour, predation, and water level. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

60|$|There I made a mouse of a bit <b>of</b> <b>muskrat</b> fur, with a {{piece of}} my leather shoestring sewed on for a tail.

40|$|Increased {{agricultural}} production within the Grand Prairie region U. S. A. {{has resulted in}} drainage of most natural wetlands within the landscape.

However, information regarding space use and survival <b>of</b> <b>muskrats</b> in these highly altered habitats is lacking.
