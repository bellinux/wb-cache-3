Bogdan-Pitești also had a sister, Elena Constanța Bogdan; both she and her mother reportedly survived his death.

While there, and as Dean of Durham (1913–18), he wrote prolifically and sometimes controversially. The Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church took exception to his liberal theological views, which some regarded as heretical, and sought unsuccessfully in 1917 to block his appointment as Bishop of Hereford.|$|E
