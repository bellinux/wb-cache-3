5|$|In {{a revised}} version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> model Jupiter trojans are {{captured}} when Jupiter encounters an ice giant during the instability. In this version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> model {{one of the}} ice giants (Uranus, Neptune, or a lost fifth planet) is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is scattered outward by Jupiter causing the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn to quickly separate. When Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps during these encounters existing Jupiter trojans can escape and new objects with semi-major axes similar to Jupiter's new semi-major axis are captured. Following its last encounter the ice giant can pass {{through one of the}} libration points and perturb their orbits leaving this libration point depleted relative to the other. After the encounters end some of these Jupiter trojans are lost and others captured when Jupiter and Saturn are near weak mean motion resonances such as the 3:7 resonance via the mechanism of the original Nice model.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{modification}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> {{model has}} the Solar System begin with five giant planets, including an additional ice giant, {{in a chain}} of mean-motion resonances. About 400 million years after {{the formation of the}} Solar System the resonance chain is broken. Instead of being scattered into the disc, the ice giants first migrate outward several AU. This divergent migration eventually leads to a resonance crossing, destabilizing the orbits of the planets. The extra ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and after a series of encounters is ejected from the Solar System. The remaining planets then continue their migration until the planetesimal disc is nearly depleted with small fractions remaining in various locations.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of the San Theodoran carnival was drawn largely from images <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> Carnival. Among the revelers, he included those dressed in the costumes of various different cartoon and film characters, such as Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Asterix, Snoopy, Groucho Marx, and Zorro. Hergé also included a band known as the Coconuts into the carnival scene; these were not developed by Hergé himself but were rather the creations of his friend and colleague Bob de Moor, who had devised them for his own comic series, Barelli. The street that they were marching down, Calle 22 de Mayo, was named after Hergé's own birthday, 22 May.|$|E

5|$|In 1981, Jean Cadenat and Jacques Blache {{revisited}} {{the type}} specimens of S. tudes {{and found that}} the lectotype from Nice is likely not a smalleye hammerhead, but rather a fetal whitefin hammerhead (S. couardi, likely a synonym of the scalloped hammerhead, S. lewini). This would also explain the anomalous locality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> specimen, as the smalleye hammerhead is not otherwise known outside of the Americas. By the rules of binomial nomenclature, Sphyra tudes should then become the valid name for the whitefin hammerhead, taking precedence over S. couardi, and the smalleye hammerhead would revert to being Sphyrna bigelowi. Taxonomists, though, have been reluctant to change the names again, preferring to keep the smalleye hammerhead as S. tudes. For this solution to have official status would require a decision by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), to reject the Nice specimen as the lectotype and designate the Cayenne specimen in its place. The relevant petition to the ICZN has not yet been put forth.|$|E
5|$|In {{their initial}} paper, Batygin and Brown {{proposed}} that Planet Nine formed {{closer to the}} Sun and was ejected into a distant eccentric orbit following a close encounter with Jupiter or Saturn during the nebular epoch. Gravitational interactions with nearby stars in the Sun's birth cluster, or dynamical friction from the gaseous remnants of the Solar nebula, then reduced the eccentricity of its orbit, raising its perihelion, leaving it on a very wide but stable orbit. Had it not been flung into the Solar System's farthest reaches, Planet Nine could have accreted more mass from the proto-planetary disk and developed into {{the core of a}} gas giant. Instead, its growth was halted early, leaving it with a lower mass of five times Earth's mass, similar to that of Uranus and Neptune. For Planet Nine to have been captured in a distant, stable orbit, its ejection must have occurred early, between three million and ten million years after the formation of the Solar System. This timing suggests that Planet Nine is not the planet ejected in a five-planet version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> model, unless that occurred too early to be the cause of the Late Heavy Bombardment, which would then require another explanation. These ejections, however, are likely to have been two events well separated in time.|$|E

25|$|In one sense, {{associative}} algebra representations generalize both {{representations of}} groups and Lie algebras.

25|$|The {{original}} core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> {{model is}} a triplet of papers published in the general science journal Nature in 2005 by an international collaboration of scientists: Rodney Gomes, Hal Levison, Alessandro Morbidelli and Kleomenis Tsiganis. In these publications, the four authors proposed that after the dissipation of the gas and dust of the primordial Solar System disk, the four giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune) were originally found on near-circular orbits between ~5.5 and ~17 astronomical units (AU), much more closely spaced and compact than in the present. A large, dense disk of small, rock and ice planetesimals, their total about 35 Earth masses, extended from the orbit of the outermost giant planet to some 35 AU.|$|E

25|$|Running {{dynamical}} {{models of}} the Solar System with different initial conditions for the simulated length {{of the history of}} the Solar System will produce the various populations of objects within the Solar System. As the initial conditions of the model are allowed to vary, each population will be more or less numerous, and will have particular orbital properties. Proving a model of the evolution of the early Solar System is difficult, since the evolution cannot be directly observed. However, the success of any dynamical model can be judged by comparing the population predictions from the simulations to astronomical observations of these populations. At the present time, computer {{models of the}} Solar System that are begun with the initial conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> scenario best match many aspects of the observed Solar System.|$|E

500|$|Until 2002, {{the venue}} for European Council summits was the member state {{that held the}} {{rotating}} Presidency of the Council of the European Union. However, European leaders agreed during ratification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Nice</b> Treaty to forego this arrangement {{at such a time}} as the total membership of the European Union surpassed 18 member states. An advanced implementation of this agreement occurred in 2002, with certain states agreeing to waive their right to host meetings, favouring Brussels as the location. Following the growth of the EU to 25 member states, with the 2004 enlargement, all subsequent official summits of the European Council have been in Brussels, with the exception of punctuated ad hoc meetings, such as the 2017 informal European Council in Malta. [...] The logistical, environmental, financial and security arrangements of hosting large summits are usually cited as the primary factors in the decision by EU leaders to move towards a permanent seat for the European Council. Additionally, some scholars argue that the move, when coupled with the formalisation of the European Council in the Lisbon Treaty, represents an institutionalisation of an ad hoc EU organ that had its origins in Luxembourg compromise, with national leaders reasserting their dominance as the EU's [...] "supreme political authority".|$|E

In an interview with Kristian Nairn (Hodor), he described filming the scene, [...] "It was a really heavy day — you’ve got these 100-mile-per-hour winds being blown into your face with false snow. I was really holding the door — there were like eight people pushing from the other side and I was really holding them back. It’s definitely Method acting. It was a very intense day but one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>nice</b> things was they let Isaac wrap me. He got to come over and say [...] "Mr. Nairn, that’s a wrap." [...] It was very emotional. It’s always been a little group of us together and it felt like our little group was breaking up." [...] Ellie Kendrick (Meera Reed) spoke about the filming of her part of the sequence, saying [...] "A lot of what's happening in that scene, in Meera's head, comes down to adrenaline. There's just no way she can stop and consider logically what's happening. If you have an army of the undead chasing after you, you're only going to be thinking one thing: [...] "Run!" [...] It was interesting, having the challenge of creating that adrenaline and fear and sadness of Hodor, but not being able to process it at all. Having to recreate that feeling of immediacy, in a stuffy studio at 4 p.m. on a Thursday when you've been filming the same scene for a couple of days, it was difficult.
