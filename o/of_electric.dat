5|$|The SI base {{units are}} the {{building}} blocks of the system and all other units are derived from them. When Maxwell first introduced the concept of a coherent system, he identified three quantities that could be used as base units: mass, length and time. Giorgi later identified the need for an electrical base unit. Theoretically any one <b>of</b> <b>electric</b> current, potential difference, electrical resistance, electrical charge or a number of other quantities could have provided the base unit, with the remaining units then being defined by the laws of physics. In the event, the unit <b>of</b> <b>electric</b> current was chosen for SI. Another three base units (for temperature, substance and luminous intensity) were added later.|$|E
5|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>electric</b> {{potential}} is {{closely linked to}} that of the electric field. A small charge placed within an electric field experiences a force, and to have brought that charge to that point against the force requires work. The electric potential at any point is defined as the energy required to bring a unit test charge from an infinite distance slowly to that point. It is usually measured in volts, and one volt is the potential for which one joule of work must be expended to bring a charge of one coulomb from infinity. This definition of potential, while formal, has little practical application, and a more useful concept is that <b>of</b> <b>electric</b> potential difference, and is the energy required to move a unit charge between two specified points. An electric field has the special property that it is conservative, which means that the path taken by the test charge is irrelevant: all paths between two specified points expend the same energy, and thus a unique value for potential difference may be stated. The volt is so strongly identified as the unit of choice for measurement and description <b>of</b> <b>electric</b> potential difference that the term voltage sees greater everyday usage.|$|E

These species produce biphasic pulsed discharges from myogenic electric organs. Spatio-temporal false-color maps <b>of</b> the <b>electric</b> organ discharges measured {{on the skin}} show that the electric field {{is not a simple}} dipole in Brachyhypopomus. Instead, the dipole center moves rostro-caudally during the 1 st phase (P 1) <b>of</b> the <b>electric</b> organ discharge, and is stationary during the 2 nd phase (P 2). Except at the head and tip <b>of</b> tail, <b>electric</b> field lines rotate in the lateral and dorso-ventral planes. Rostro-caudal dierences in field amplitude, field lines, and spatial stability suggest that dierent parts <b>of</b> the <b>electric</b> organ have undergone selection for dierent functions; the rostral portions seem specialized for electrosensory processing, whereas the caudal portions show adapta-tions for d. c. signal balancing and mate attraction as well.
