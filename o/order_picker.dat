5000|$|The term [...] "bucket brigade" [...] is {{also used}} for a certain method of {{organizing}} manual order picking in distribution centers. Here customer orders to be processed are passed from one <b>order</b> <b>picker</b> to the next.

50|$|A man-aboard {{system can}} provide {{significant}} floorspace savings over manual or fork lift operations {{but is not}} truly an AS/RS, as the operation is still manual. Storage system heights are not limited by the reach height of the <b>order</b> <b>picker,</b> as the picker rides along on the platform as it is moved vertically or horizontally to the various storage locations. Shelves or storage cabinets can be stacked as high as floor loading, weight capacity, throughput requirements, and/or ceiling heights will permit. Man-aboard storage and retrieval systems are {{far and away the}} most expensive picker-to-stock equipment alternative, but are less expensive than a fully automated system. Aisle-captive storage/retrieval machines reaching heights up to 40 feet cost around $125,000. Hence, there must be enough storage density and/or productivity improvement over cart and tote picking to justify the investment. Also, because vertical travel is slow compared to horizontal travel, typical picking rates in man-aboard operations range between 40 and 250 lines per person-hour. The range is large because there is a wide variety of operating schemes for man-aboard systems. Man-aboard systems are typically appropriate for slow-moving items where space is fairly expensive.|$|E
50|$|Hand trucks (including {{carts and}} dollies), the {{simplest}} type of industrial truck, cannot transport or stack pallets, is non-powered, and requires the operator to walk. A pallet jack, which cannot stack a pallet, uses front wheels mounted inside {{the end of}} forks that extend to the floor as the pallet is only lifted enough to clear the floor for subsequent travel. A counterbalanced lift truck (sometimes {{referred to as a}} forklift truck, but other attachments besides forks can be used) can transport and stack pallets and allows the operator to ride on the truck. The weight of the vehicle (and operator) behind the front wheels of truck counterbalances weight of the load (and weight of vehicle beyond front wheels); the front wheels act as a fulcrum or pivot point. Narrow-aisle trucks usually require that the operator stand-up while riding {{in order to reduce the}} truck’s turning radius. Reach mechanisms and outrigger arms that straddle and support a load can be used in addition to the just the counterbalance of the truck. On a turret truck, the forks rotate during stacking, eliminating the need for the truck itself to turn in narrow aisles. An <b>order</b> <b>picker</b> allows the operator to be lifted with the load to allow for less-than-pallet-load picking. Automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are industrial trucks that can transport loads without requiring a human operator.|$|E
40|$|E-commerce {{companies}} {{often use}} manual order-picking systems in their warehouses since these systems {{can provide the}} required flexibility and scalability. Manual systems have been widely studied, but the operating policies may require significant changes for e-commerce settings. First, to maintain consumers' loyalty, {{it is important to}} maintain delivery reliability even on the busiest days. When the number of <b>order</b> <b>pickers</b> in an area increases, however, more delays due to interactions may occur. For example, travel speed may need to be lowered when <b>order</b> <b>pickers</b> pass each other in narrow aisles. Second, many products sold through e-commerce are returned by consumers. Before these returned products can be sold again, they must be reintegrated in the stock. This paper presents hybrid genetic algorithms to determine routes for simultaneous pickup of products in response to consumers' orders and delivery of returned products to storage locations. Furthermore, interactions between the <b>order</b> <b>pickers</b> are considered in the routing decisions. The developed algorithms use specific warehouse problem characteristics. We identify the mix of pickups and deliveries to realise the highest savings in practice. It is shown that order-picker interactions can be a significant cause for delay and should be accounted for in the routing...|$|R

50|$|In July 2012, German TV channel ZDF {{broadcast}} {{a report on}} the packing and distribution centre operated for Zalando by a provider near Berlin. The report showed the appalling working conditions at the company providing logistical services to Zalando. In the logistical center of Großbeeren certain staff, who often commute more than 200 km per day from nearby Poland, are not allowed to sit down during their working day. It was further shown that employees were subject to continuous scrutiny, workspace was extremely confined and for several hundreds of employees there was only one filthy toilet container. The ZDF also criticized the hourly wage of €7,01, which was nonetheless in conformity with the minimum hourly wages for agency workers in East-Germany. Following the ZDF report it was revealed that Zalando had also received a 22,5 million euro subsidy from the government of Thüringen to build a new headquarters.According to a ZDF reporter who went undercover, around 40 employees are being paid by the taxpayer between seven and nine days every month in the framework of apprenticeship programs, while one third of the employees are agency workers. Following the report Zalando announced that it would scrutinize its service providers more strictly.In April 2014 RTL broadcast the documentary Unrelenting pressure in the workplace (Arbeiten unter Dauerdruck), which had been made with the support of undercover journalist Günter Wallraff. The documentary led to renewed criticism on the labour conditions at Zalando. Journalist Caro Lobig worked undercover for three months as an <b>order</b> <b>picker</b> in the logistical center at Erfurt. During an eight-hour shift she had to walk up to 27 kilometers. After five weeks she started to suffer from circulation problems. According to an anonymous employee working at the ambulance service, there is hardly a day when they are not called to the logistics center. According to a labour judge interviewed by RTL, Zalando violates German Labour law because of its rules on breaks, by prohibiting its employees from sitting down and by imposing airport-security-type measures on its employees. Through its tight control over its employees, Zalando would also be in violation of privacy rules. RTL requested Zalando to give comments to the allegations but Zalando refused. Instead, Zalando filed a complaint against Lobig for revealing corporate secrets. Lobig in turn filed a complaint against the company regarding her severance pay.|$|E

The order-picking policy of each <b>order</b> <b>picker</b> handling one order {{at a time to}} avoid picking errors is captured by a specific service discipline, which, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, has not been studied before. As this service discipline does not satisfy the so-called branching property, we establish stochastic bounds for the order flow times. These bounds are shown to be adequate and aid in setting targets for the throughput of the storage area, which, in turn, is the input rate of the workstations.

40|$|International audienceIn this {{abstract}} {{we address}} an integrated warehouse order picking problem. The warehouse is divided in the picking and the storage areas. We {{focus on the}} picking area. It contains a set of aisles, each composed {{by a set of}} storage positions. For each period of the working day each position contains several pieces of a unique product, defined by its reference. The warehouse is not automated, and the order pickers can prepare up to K parcels in a given picking route. For each period of the working day a set of customers orders is received at the warehouse. An order is a set of product references, each associated with a quantity, i. e. the number of pieces required. The problem consists in jointly deciding:(1) the assignment of references to storage positions in the aisles which need to be filled up;(2) the division of orders into several parcels, respecting weight and size constraints;(3) the batching of parcels into groups of size K, that implicitly define the routing into the picking area. The routing is assumed to follow a return policy, i. e. an <b>order</b> <b>picker</b> enters and leaves each aisle from the same end. The objective function is to minimize the total routing cost.

40|$|Batching {{orders and}} routing <b>order</b> <b>pickers</b> is a {{commonly}} studied problem in many picker-to-parts warehouses. The impact {{of individual differences}} in picking skills on performance has received little attention. In this paper, we show that taking into account differences in the skills of individual pickers when assigning work has a substantial effect on total batch execution time and picker productivity. We demonstrate this for {{the case of a}} Finnish retailer. First, using time-stamped picking data, multilevel modeling is used to forecast batch execution times for individual pickers by modeling individual skills of pickers. Next, these forecasts are used to minimize total batch execution time, by assigning the right picker to the right order batch. We formulate the problem as a joint order batching and generalized assignment model, and solve it with an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search algorithm. For the sample company, we are able to improve state-of-the-art batching and routing methods by almost 10 % taking skill differences among pickers into account and minimizing the sum of total order processing time.
