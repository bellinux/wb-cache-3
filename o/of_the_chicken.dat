40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} viruses (HPAIVs) cause lethal infection in chickens. Severe cases of HPAIV infections have been also reported in mammals, including humans. In both mammals and birds, {{the relationship between}} host cytokine response to the infection with HPAIVs and lethal outcome has not been well understood. In the present study, the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses A/turkey/Italy/ 4580 / 1999 (H 7 N 1) (Ty/Italy) and A/ chicken/Netherlands/ 2586 / 2003 (H 7 N 7) (Ck/NL) and the low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) A/chicken/ Ibaraki/ 1 / 2005 (H 5 N 2) (Ck/Ibaraki) were intranasally inoculated into chickens. Ty/Italy replicated more extensively than Ck/NL in systemic tissues <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>chickens,</b> especially in <b>the</b> brain, and induced excessive mRNA expression of inflammatory and antiviral cytokines (IFN-γ, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and IFN-α) in proportion to its proliferation.

5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken.

There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E

The results showed that garlic, ginger and mixtures contained 7. 41, 5. 85 and 6. 62 % crude protein respectively. Dietary treatment significantly influenced the final liveweights (FLW) of broiler chicks (P< 0. 001) and chickens (P< 0. 01). <b>The</b> mixtures <b>of</b> garlic and ginger significantly (P< 0. 001) improved FLW and weight gain th <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 28 day old chicks than those of control birds.

Dietary treatment significantly (P< 0. 001) affected the carcass parts and organs development of broiler chickens.

5|$|The tornado {{touched down}} north of Section, {{initially}} producing EF0 to EF1 tree damage. The tornado rapidly intensified to low-end EF4 strength {{as it passed}} northwest of Pisgah and Rosalie, destroying numerous mobile homes and block foundation homes, scattering the debris hundreds of yards and killing three people. Thousands of trees were snapped and debarked, vehicles were thrown up to 50 yards in different directions, and multiple barns and chicken houses were heavily damaged, along with {{the roof of a}} church. As it passed near Flat Rock and Higdon, the tornado reached high-end EF4 strength, mowing down thousands of trees in this rural area. As the tornado struck a farm, a home and two chicken houses were completely obliterated and swept away.

Thousands of trees were snapped, a log cabin was destroyed, livestock was killed, chicken houses were flattened, and a van was lofted and dropped into a field 400 yards away from where it originated. The tornado then crossed into Georgia and struck Trenton as an EF3, killing two people.
