5|$|Their {{last major}} {{military}} campaign was the Franklin-Nashville Campaign of November and December 1864. Ross {{and his men}} led the Confederate advance into Tennessee. Between the beginning of November and December 27, his men captured 550 prisoners, several hundred horses, and enough <b>overcoats</b> and blankets to survive the winter chill. Only 12 of Ross's men were killed, with 70 wounded and five captured.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the weather}} had been mostly rainy {{up to this point}} in the campaign, a snow storm arrived the night of February 13, with strong winds that brought {{temperatures}} down to 10–12°F (−12°C) and deposited 3inches (8cm) of snow by morning. Guns and wagons were frozen to the earth. Because of the proximity of the enemy lines and the active sharpshooters, the soldiers could not light campfires for warmth or cooking, and both sides were miserable that night, many having arrived without blankets or <b>overcoats.</b>|$|E
5|$|Frank McNamara made a bed {{of leaves}} for the {{survivor}} and built a fire to help keep him as warm and comfortable as possible. McNamara stayed with the survivor while Inkpen went to summon help. After several hours, ambulance crews arrived and administered first-aid and morphia. Rescue workers constructed a stretcher using saplings, bandages and <b>overcoats.</b> They covered the survivor with an overcoat and carried him for two hours to cover about two miles through thickly wooded country to McNamara's utility truck, which then carried him and his rescuers to a waiting ambulance.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was the initiation of <b>overcoating</b> TRISO particles with 425 {micro}m kernels. In the AGR- 1 task, the <b>overcoating</b> process was optimized for particles with an outer diameter (OD) of 780 {micro}m and a 350 {micro}m kernel. Therefore it needed to be determined how well the <b>overcoating</b> process used to fabricate AGR- 1 compacts would perform on particles with an 855 {micro}m OD and a 425 {micro}m kernel. The matrix properties and <b>overcoating</b> procedures were altered from the AGR- 1 processes in order to attempt to optimize the <b>overcoating</b> of TRISO particles with 425 {micro}m kernels. This report summarizes the changes that were made to the matrix and the <b>overcoating</b> process in order to achieve successful <b>overcoating</b> of the larger particles...|$|R
5|$|On 3 November, {{with her}} {{reconditioning}} complete, West Honaker sailed from New York. After transiting the Panama Canal {{a week after}} her departure, she headed for Brisbane, Australia, where she arrived on 13 December. After then calling at Sydney, Melbourne, Port Pirie, and Adelaide through 8 January 1941, West Honaker called at Melbourne and Sydney before departing for the United States on 18 January. Loaded with a cargo of wool intended for uniforms, blankets, and <b>overcoats</b> for the military, West Honaker arrived at New Bedford, Massachusetts, on 3 March.|$|E
5|$|At 10p.m. on March 5, the Mexican {{artillery}} ceased their bombardment. As Santa Anna had anticipated, {{the exhausted}} Texians soon {{fell into the}} first uninterrupted sleep {{many of them had}} since the siege began. Just after midnight, more than 2,000 Mexican soldiers began preparing for the final assault. Fewer than 1,800 were divided into four columns, commanded by Cos, Colonel Francisco Duque, Colonel José María Romero and Colonel Juan Morales. Veterans were positioned {{on the outside of the}} columns to better control the new recruits and conscripts in the middle. As a precaution, 500 Mexican cavalry were positioned around the Alamo to prevent escape of either Texian or Mexican soldiers. Santa Anna remained in camp with the 400 reserves. Despite the bitter cold, the soldiers were ordered not to wear <b>overcoats</b> which could impede their movements. Clouds concealed the moon and thus the movements of the soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{were made}} in 1876, {{introducing}} more elaborate uniforms for commissioned officers based on those worn by the 13th Hussars, with similarly militaristic uniforms for the other ranks, using gold braid to distinguish the non-commissioned officers. These uniforms were initially of rather low quality, as the government had contracted out the work to prison convicts. The winter uniforms comprised grey <b>overcoats</b> with fur caps and moccasins, although the police preferred wearing warmer buffalo coats, which were available until the herds died out. In 1886, the hussar-style uniforms were replaced by a simpler dragoon version, and dark-blue undress uniforms introduced. In the 1880s, blue pea jackets made from pilot cloth became popular among the police {{as part of their}} winter outfit, and were officially issued from 1893 onwards. There were continual attempts to produce a consistent uniform across the force, but this was only ever partially successful due to the multiple government suppliers who each produced slightly different variants.|$|E

40|$|<b>Overcoating</b> {{constriction}} microbridges with semiconducting germanium provides additional {{thermal conductivity}} at liquid-helium temperatures {{to reduce the}} effects of self-heating in these Josephson junctions. Microwave-induced steps were observed in the I-V characteristics of an <b>overcoated</b> Dayem bridge fabricated in a 15 -nm-thick niobium film; at least 20 steps could be counted at 4. 2 K. No steps were observed in the I-V characteristics of the bridge prior to <b>overcoating.</b> In addition, the germanium <b>overcoat</b> can protect against electrical disturbances at room temperature...|$|R
50|$|The {{cost of a}} new <b>overcoat</b> {{is beyond}} Akaky's meager salary, so he forces himself to live within a strict budget to save {{sufficient}} {{money to buy the}} new <b>overcoat.</b> Meanwhile, he and Petrovich frequently meet to discuss the style of the new coat. During that time, Akaky's zeal for copying is replaced with excitement about his new <b>overcoat,</b> to the point that he thinks of little else. Finally, with the addition of an unexpectedly large holiday salary bonus, Akaky has saved enough money to buy a new <b>overcoat.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 1885, Helena {{made plans}} to move to New York in the United States to join her sister Lena and her husband. Goldman wanted to join her sister, but their father refused to allow it. Despite Helena's offer {{to pay for the}} trip, Abraham turned a deaf ear to their pleas. Desperate, Goldman {{threatened}} to throw herself into the Neva River if she could not go. He finally agreed, and on December 29, 1885, Helena and Emma arrived at New York City's Castle Garden, the entry for immigrants. They settled upstate, living in the Rochester home which Lena had made with her husband Samuel. Fleeing the rising antisemitism of Saint Petersburg, their parents and brothers joined them a year later. Goldman began working as a seamstress, sewing <b>overcoats</b> for more than ten hours a day, earning two and a half dollars a week. She asked for a raise and was denied; she quit and took work at a smaller shop nearby.|$|E
5|$|Zoroastrians were {{subjected}} to public discrimination through dress regulations – not allowed to wear new or white clothes, and compelled by enactments to wear the dull yellow raiment already alluded to as a distinguishing badge. They {{were not allowed to}} wear <b>overcoats</b> but were compelled to wear long robes called qaba and cotton geeveh on their feet even in winter. Wearing eyeglasses, long cloak, trousers, hat, boots, socks, winding their turbans tightly and neatly, carrying watch or a ring, were all forbidden to Zoroastrians. During the rainy days they were not allowed carry umbrellas or to appear in public, because the water that had run down through their bodies and cloths could pollute the Muslims. Zoroastrian men in Yazd would carry a large shawl that they would place under their feet when visiting a Muslim's home so as to prevent the carpet from being polluted. Forbidden from riding horses and only allowed to ride mules or donkeys, upon facing a Muslim they had to dismount. Not until 1923, was the general proscription against Zoroastrians' riding horses and donkeys lifted by Reza Shah.|$|E

40|$|Granular {{silver and}} copper films {{deposited}} on glass have been <b>overcoated</b> {{with a thick}} layer either of similar or dissimilar metal. The optical behavior of these films was then studied by measuring the reflectance from the glass side in the spectral region from 0. 3 to 1. 0 micron. Results indicated that the <b>overcoated</b> granular films preserved their aggregate structure, even after <b>overcoating.</b> The samples were also subjected to prolonged heat treatments {{and changes in the}} optical properties were studied. In general, al though a shift in absorption structures has been observed, the overall optical behavior of the <b>overcoated</b> films remained similar. Analysis of optical properties has been made using a mean-field type theory approach...|$|R
