5|$|The {{painting}} {{contains elements}} typical of Cimabue's representations of Christ, including the illusionism of the drapery folds, the large halo, long flowing hair, dark, angular faces and dramatic expressions. But in <b>other</b> <b>respects</b> it {{conforms to the}} then strict iconography of the thirteenth century. Typical of depictions of the crucified Christ of this era, with his outstretched arms he is as wide as he is long, conforming to prevalent ideals of proportions.|$|E
5|$|In 1139 Foliot {{was elected}} Abbot of Gloucester, blessed by the diocesan bishop on 11June 1139. The {{appointment}} {{had been pushed}} through by Foliot's relative, Miles of Gloucester, who was by then the Earl of Hereford. Foliot was well connected at court in <b>other</b> <b>respects,</b> for his probable father had been steward to David I, before David became King of Scotland. David was the uncle of both the Empress and Stephen's wife. Following his elevation to abbot Foliot recognised Stephen as king, although he seems until then to have supported Matilda.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, a fragmentary fossil {{of another}} species of this {{same group of}} oryzomyines was found in eastern Argentina. It was {{initially}} identified as a possible second species of Noronhomys {{on the basis of}} the presence of a crest on the upper first molar, the mesoloph, but the specimen is different from Noronhomys vespuccii in <b>other</b> <b>respects,</b> and in 2008 it was described as a new genus and species, Carletonomys cailoi, related to Noronhomys and associated genera.|$|E

It is to be on display at the Indiana Statehouse at all times. The flag must also be displayed at any agency that is funded in part or in full by the state government, including public schools, state universities, and state parks. In all <b>other</b> <b>respects</b> the flag should be treated with the same care and respect as the flag of the United States.|$|E
5|$|In his book, The World's Worst Warships, naval {{historian}} Antony Preston characterised the popovkas like this: But in <b>other</b> <b>respects,</b> {{they were}} a dismal failure. They were too slow to stem the current in the Dniepr, and proved very difficult to steer. In practice the discharge of even one gun caused them to turn {{out of control and}} even contra-rotating some of six propellers was unable to keep the ship on the correct heading. Nor could they cope with the rough weather which is frequently encountered in the Black Sea. They were prone to rapid rolling and pitching in anything more than a flat calm, and could not aim or load their guns under such circumstances.|$|E
5|$|In <b>other</b> <b>respects,</b> {{individual}} countries had different preferences for styles of memorial. French communities usually chose simple monuments, located in public spaces, and deliberately avoided political or religious imagery and rhetoric. In Australia and the US, memorial halls – {{some of which}} were large, grand structures – were popular. Australia also created the idea of an Avenue of Honour, involving lines of trees, with memorial plaques, along a road. Canadians often brought back various material from Europe for their memorials, including pieces of local European churches and soil from the relevant battlefields. Individual countries also had typical national symbols that were widely incorporated, from the British Britannia, to the Gallic rooster to the Romanian vulture. Postcards of war memorials were widely produced in Britain and Italy, and ceramic models of the more famous ones, such as the Cenotaph, were sold as souvenirs.|$|E

5|$|Modularity: The {{cerebellar}} {{system is}} functionally divided into {{more or less}} independent modules, which probably number in the hundreds to thousands. All modules have a similar internal structure, but different inputs and outputs. A module (a multizonal microcompartment in the terminology of Apps and Garwicz) consists of a small cluster of neurons in the inferior olivary nucleus, a set of long narrow strips of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex (microzones), and a small cluster of neurons {{in one of the}} deep cerebellar nuclei. Different modules share input from mossy fibers and parallel fibers, but in <b>other</b> <b>respects</b> they appear to function independently—the output of one module does not appear to significantly influence the activity of other modules.|$|E
5|$|The {{directorship}} of Neil MacGregor saw a major rehang at the Gallery, {{dispensing with}} {{the classification of}} paintings by national school that had been introduced by Eastlake. The new chronological hang sought to emphasise the interaction between cultures rather than fixed national characteristics, reflecting the change in art historical values since the 19th century. In <b>other</b> <b>respects,</b> however, Victorian tastes were rehabilitated: the building's interiors were no longer considered an embarrassment and were restored, and in 1999 the Gallery accepted a bequest of 26 Italian Baroque paintings from Sir Denis Mahon. Earlier in the 20th century many considered the Baroque to be beyond the pale: in 1945 the Gallery's trustees declined to buy a Guercino from Mahon's collection for £200. The same painting was valued at £4million in 2003. Mahon's bequest was made {{on the condition that}} the Gallery would never deaccession any of its paintings or charge for admission.|$|E
5|$|The {{way that}} leads to the abyss for the German people has now come. The party patriots {{continue}} ever to believe and hope. Also, there are still those who do not want to see, and they expect a miracle from the Führer. Those are {{the kind of people who}} do not give up hope even at the edge of the grave. In all <b>other</b> <b>respects,</b> the number of peace seekers grows from hour to hour. The coming generations, and the foreign countries, will want to understand why the German people themselves did not turn against the party tyranny and stop the Nazi Party leaders by force in order to terminate this horrible war. For this, something should be said to clear up the question.|$|E

5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In <b>other</b> <b>respects,</b> the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E
5|$|Three Studies for Figures at the Base of a Crucifixion {{is a key}} {{precursor}} to Bacon's later work, and he sustained its formal and thematic preoccupations throughout his career. The triptych format, the placement of figures behind glass in heavily gilded frames, the open mouth, the use of painterly distortion, the Furies, and {{the theme of the}} Crucifixion were all to reappear in later works. Bacon's principal mode of expression is introduced: the subjects are anatomically and physically distorted, and the mood is violent, foreboding, and relentlessly physical. In <b>other</b> <b>respects</b> the triptych stands apart from other paintings in his oeuvre. It refers directly to its inspirations, and interprets the source material in an uncharacteristically literal manner. The triptych is further distinct in that its creatures are located in an outside space; by 1948, Bacon's studies of heads and figures specifically emphasised their confinement in rooms or other closed spaces.|$|E
5|$|Zinc {{chemistry}} {{is similar to}} the chemistry of the late first-row transition metals, nickel and copper, though it has a filled d-shell and compounds are diamagnetic and mostly colorless. The ionic radii of zinc and magnesium happen to be nearly identical. Because of this some of the equivalent salts have the same crystal structure, and in other circumstances where ionic radius is a determining factor, the chemistry of zinc has much in common with that of magnesium. In <b>other</b> <b>respects,</b> there is little similarity with the late first-row transition metals. Zinc tends to form bonds with a greater degree of covalency and much more stable complexes with N- and S- donors. Complexes of zinc are mostly 4- or 6- coordinate although 5-coordinate complexes are known.|$|E
