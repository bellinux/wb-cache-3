5|$|From 4 December 1956 to 26 February 1957, Takechi {{served as}} {{the host of the}} Nippon Television program, The Tetsuji Takechi Hour. The show {{featured}} the Takechi Kabuki's interpretations of such Japanese stage classics as Chūshingura, and was also known for pushing the limits <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> of sexual subjects on television for its time. Takechi directed two more kabuki performances for the Nissei Theater in Tokyo, not long after it was opened in 1963. Though these would be his last kabuki productions, Takechi's influence on the art form continued to be felt for decades after his departure for the cinema.|$|E
5|$|The ACA {{includes}} {{provisions to}} take effect between 2010 and 2020, although most took effect on January 1, 2014. Few areas of the US health care system were left untouched, making it the most sweeping health care reform since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. However, some areas were more affected than others. The individual insurance market was radically overhauled, {{and many of the}} law's regulations applied specifically to this market, while the structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market were largely retained. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> gains were made through the expansion of Medicaid, and the biggest cost savings were made in Medicare. Some regulations applied to the employer market, and the law also made delivery system changes that affected most of the health care system. Not all provisions took full effect. Some were made discretionary, some were deferred, and others were repealed before implementation.|$|E
5|$|Before {{broadcasting}} began, the BBC considered airing {{the show}} on a Saturday night timeslot as its research found that any potential viewers {{were less likely to}} watch television on Saturdays than most other nights of the week; the BBC hoped that Spooks would boost its timeslot. However, the series instead broadcast on Mondays. The series began broadcasting on 13 May 2002 on BBC One during the 9 to 10pm timeslot, and continued on every Monday night until 17 June 2002, {{with the exception of the}} fourth episode, which was viewed on Tuesday 4 June starting at 10pm, due to an overrun <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> of Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee. The episodes were also repeated on the digital channel BBC Choice. In the US, the first series aired in mid-2003 on A. However, each episode had approximately ten minutes edited out to accommodate for advert breaks. The DVD release of the series in America contained the uncut episodes. The first series was later repeated on BBC America, alongside the second series starting in June 2007.|$|E

5|$|Legislation {{requires}} that all presidential and parliamentary election candidates (or slates) are guaranteed equal opportunity to present and discuss their platforms {{in the media}} (in addition to paid advertising). In 2007 the parliamentary election campaign was covered by all media, including nationwide television broadcasters. During this period the broadcasters, which included Croatian Radiotelevision (HTV), RTL Televizija (RTL) and Nova TV, aired 27.8hours of news on 22 different programs with 1,196 news reports. This total included 171 reports dealing directly with the elections. Analysis of news coverage indicated evenly-matched coverage of the combined ruling party (HDZ) and official government statements on one side, and the main opposition party (SDP) on the other; each received an average of a 37.5-percent share of coverage and a 33-percent share of interviews aired. HTV and Nova TV gave a slight advantage to the HDZ and the government, while RTL gave more coverage to the SDP. However, the differences were small and resulted in matching ratios. Other political parties received considerably less coverage. HNS received an average of approximately 11 percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coverage,</b> HSS received six percent and all other parties received less than five-percent coverage. The national television broadcasters air programs where all slates and candidates may talk about their platforms and organise debates.|$|E

25|$|With seven {{separate}} shooting victims, {{including six}} deaths, {{in the first}} 15 hours of the D.C. area spree, the North American media soon devoted enormous coverage to the shootings. By the middle of October 2002, all news television networks provided {{live coverage of the}} aftermath of each attack, with the coverage often lasting for hours at a time. The Fox show America's Most Wanted devoted an entire episode to the shooters in hopes of aiding in their capture. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> of the case in The New York Times was written by Jayson Blair and subsequently found to be fabricated; the ensuing scandal led the newspaper's two top editors, Howell Raines and Gerald Boyd, to resign.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical comparison <b>of</b> <b>the</b> growth characteristics <b>of</b> four code coverage measures, block, decision, c-use and p-use, as testing is increased. Due to the theoretical foundations underlying the lognormal software reliability growth model, we hypothesize {{that the growth}} for each coverage measure is lognormal. Further, since for a given program the breadth and <b>the</b> depth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> different <b>coverage</b> measures are similar, we expect that <b>the</b> parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lognormal <b>coverage</b> growth model for each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> four <b>coverage</b> measures to be similar. We confirm these hypotheses using coverage data generated from extensive testing of an application which has 30 KLOC. We then discuss how <b>the</b> lognormal <b>coverage</b> growth function {{could be used to}} control the testing process and to guide decisions about when to stop testing, since it can provide an estimate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marginal testing effort necessary to achieve a given level <b>of</b> improvement in <b>the</b> <b>coverage.</b>|$|R

Matthew LaClair, a New Jersey high school senior expressed concerns to a think tank, the Center for Inquiry, regarding what he felt was conservative bias in the textbook, specifically inaccuracies about its coverage of global warming. He wrote an opinion piece in the Los Angeles Times. The group issued a critical report on the textbook. The group's criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> on climate was buttressed by a few scientists and then additional criticism from legal scholars, who claimed the book presented a skewed view of {{separation of church and}} state. The publisher, Houghton Mifflin, announced that it would review the book, as did the College Board, which oversees college-level Advanced Placement courses used in high schools.|$|E

25|$|The Libyan {{civil war}} has brought forth many new {{magazines}} and newspapers, including Al-Jazirah Al-Libiyah, Intifada Al-Ahrar, Al-Kalima, Libya Hurriya (Free Libya), Akhbar Al-Aan and many others. At {{the end of}} March there were half {{a dozen or so}} new publications. By the beginning of May that had grown to 28, by late May to 65, and in August it was over 120.

In spite of the large number of new publications, much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> of the Libyan conflict has been left to international media outlets such as CNN and Al Jazeera, in part {{due to a lack of}} experienced professional staff, in part to years of living under a repressive media regime, and in part due to a shortage of financing.|$|E

25|$|WFAA was {{the first}} station {{to break the news}} of President John F. Kennedy's {{assassination}} on November 22, 1963, which occurred about two blocks north of the station's studios near Dealey Plaza, outside the Texas School Book Depository (now known as the Dallas County Administration Building), and seriously injured then-Governor John Connally, who was riding in the motorcade carrying Kennedy. The station conducted the first live television interview with Abraham Zapruder, who shot the famous film of the assassination. During the course of the interview with Zapruder, who came to the Communications Center studio by police escort, WFAA announcer and program director, Jay Watson (who reported on the shooting with Jerry Haynes, both of whom heard the gunshots being fired at Kennedy), intimated that the film was to be developed in the station's film lab; however, WFAA did not possess the ability to process the Kodachrome II 8mm safety film from Zapruder's camera. WFAA and its live remote unit fed much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>coverage</b> of the assassination and its aftermath to ABC over the next four days. The shooting of accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby in the basement of Dallas police headquarters, however, was not broadcast live (as it was on NBC) or on tape (as on CBS one minute later) by WFAA and ABC as the former's live newsgathering truck was positioned elsewhere at the time. ABC was therefore only able to show delayed newsreel footage of the historic event. WFAA had purchased a fully equipped, live broadcast studio truck prior to the assassination of Kennedy, but the truck was not rolled out for the parade through downtown Dallas. In the aftermath of the murder, the staff was told the cost would have been too great for the news department to compensate the production facility for its use.|$|E
