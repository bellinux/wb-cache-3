Panoramic radiographs of 120 <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> patients (76 males and 44 females) and 120 controls (68 males and 52 females) were examined for any calcifications in the carotid artery. The mean age of the patients with <b>renal</b> <b>stones</b> and controls was 40. 6 ± 7. 8 years and 41. 1 ± 6. 7 years, respectively. A total of 25 (20. 8 %) patients with <b>renal</b> <b>stones</b> and 16 (12. 3 %) patients from the control group showed CAC.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> disease detected on computed tomography (CT). Method: A total 1812 patients who underwent abdomen-pelvis CT in July 2015 were included in this study. The inclusion criteria for NAFLD were as follows: (i) lower average Hounsfield unit (HU) of hepatic right lobe, left medial and lateral segment when {{compared with that of}} spleen, (ii) patients who having urolithiasis in kidneys, ureters and urinary bladder, and (iii) patients underwent abdomen-pelvis CT including noncontrast image. The statistical significance of the association between NAFLD and <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> disease was assessed using Chi Square Test. The Odds ratios and 95 % CI were calculated to assess the propensity of <b>renal</b> <b>stones</b> disease for NAFLD by using Logistic Regression analysis. Results: The frequency of <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> disease in patients with NAFLD was higher approximately 19 % than those who having <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> disease without NAFLD. In addition, the presence of NAFLD was linked with <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> disease showing that detection rate of <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> disease in patients with NAFLD was markedly high (odds ratio: 5, 95 % CI, 3 – 8. 2) (p <  0. 05) in multivariate analysis.

Objectives: To determine <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> composition in patients using single-source dual-energy rapid-peak kilovolt (kVp) switching CT. Method: Nineteen patients with <b>renal</b> <b>stones</b> for percutaneous nephrolithotomy were evaluated with single-source dual-energy computed tomography on a Discovery CT 750 HD. The Gemstone Spectral Imaging (GSI) effective atomic number (Z eff) and attenuation at 70 keV monochromatic energy were used to predict the stone composition. Infrared spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction of stones after extraction served as the reference standard. Results: Two (10. 5 %) of the 19 stones had uric acid as major component. The other 17 (89. 5 %) were calcium-based stones. No statistically significant difference between the GSI Z eff and calculated effective atomic number (Z) for stone compounds was found.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy and safety of retrograde intrarenal surgery (RIRS) for the treatment of <b>renal</b> <b>stones</b> and to analyze the predictive factors for stone-free. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who underwent RIRS for <b>renal</b> <b>stones</b> from January 2000 to July 2009. We identified 66 RIRSs (63 patients with 3 bilateral <b>renal</b> <b>stones)</b> and collected data. Stone-free and success were respectively defined as no visible stones and clinically insignificant residual stones less than 3 mm on postoperative imaging; predictive factors for stone-free were evaluated. Results: Of the 66 <b>renal</b> <b>stones,</b> 18 stones (27. 3 %) were located in the upper pole or midpole or renal pelvis and 48 (72. 7 %) in the lower pole with or without others, respectively. The mean cumulative stone burden was 168. 9 ± 392. 5 mm 2. The immediate postoperative stone-free rate was 69. 7 %, and it increased to 72. 7 % at 1 month after surgery. The success rate was 80. 3 % both immediately after the operation and 1 month later. In the multivariate analysis, stone location except at the lower pole (p= 0. 049) and small cumulative stone burden (p= 0. 002) were significantly favorable predictive factors for the immediate postoperative stone-free rate.

40|$|PURPOSE: The {{metabolic}} {{and environmental}} factors influencing <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> formation before, during, and after Space Shuttle flights were assessed. We established the contributing roles of dietary factors {{in relationship to the}} urinary risk factors associated with <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> formation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 24 -hr. urine samples were collected prior to, during space flight, and following landing. Urinary and dietary factors associated with <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> formation were analyzed and the relative urinary supersaturation of calcium oxalate, calcium phosphate (brushite), sodium urate, struvite and uric acid were calculated. RESULTS: Urinary composition changed during flight to favor the crystallization of calcium-forming salts. Factors that contributed to increased potential for stone formation during space flight were significant reductions in urinary pH and increases in urinary calcium. Urinary output and citrate, a potent inhibitor of calcium-containing stones, were slightly reduced during space flight. Dietary intakes were significantly reduced for a number of variables, including fluid, energy, protein, potassium, phosphorus and magnesium. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first in-flight characterization of the <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> forming potential in astronauts. With the examination of urinary components and nutritional factors, it was possible to determine the factors that contributed to increased risk or protected from risk. In spite of the protective components, the negative contributions to <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> risk predominated and resulted in a urinary environment that favored the supersaturation of stone-forming salts. Dietary and pharmacologic therapies need to be assessed to minimize the potential for <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> formation in astronauts during/after space flight...|$|R

Considerable {{amount of time}} and effort has been expended researching and developing systems capable of classifying <b>renal</b> <b>stones</b> patients truly. This paper proposes a new approach for this classification by using a hybrid model of Rough Sets & ANN to predict optimum <b>renal</b> <b>stone</b> fragmentation in patients being managed by extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL). Rough Sets used to reduce the input factors and detect the most important ones that are used as input vectors for the ANN. The result (of treatment and the model) will be Free (success in removing the stone completely) or not Free...|$|R
