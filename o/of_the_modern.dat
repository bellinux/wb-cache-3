50|$|After Dermott's death, the two Grand Lodges {{moved slowly}} towards union. The need for unity was {{underlined}} during the Napoleonic wars, when <b>the</b> leaders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancients, <b>Moderns,</b> and <b>the</b> Grand Lodge <b>of</b> Scotland acted together {{to prevent their}} lodges becoming proscribed organisations. However, <b>the</b> actual process <b>of</b> unification did not start until 1811, when <b>the</b> <b>Moderns</b> started <b>the</b> administrative process <b>of</b> returning their ritual to a form acceptable to the other British Grand Lodges. The final union was in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> two sons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> King, <b>the</b> Duke <b>of</b> Sussex, <b>the</b> Grand Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moderns,</b> and <b>the</b> Duke <b>of</b> Kent. Kent had already effected a union in Canada by simply abolishing <b>the</b> <b>Moderns,</b> and merging their lodges with those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancients. The new Grand Lodge, the United Grand Lodge <b>of</b> England, retained <b>the</b> infrastructure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moderns,</b> and <b>the</b> ritual <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancients.|$|R

2500|$|In 1809, <b>the</b> Grand Lodge <b>of</b> England (<b>the</b> <b>Moderns)</b> {{set up a}} [...] "Lodge of Promulgation". Its {{purpose was}} to [...] "revert to the Ancient Land Marks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Society" [...] and to {{promulgate}} those landmarks amongst <b>the</b> brethren. One <b>of</b> its members was <b>the</b> Duke <b>of</b> Sussex, <b>the</b> Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lodge <b>of</b> Antiquity, No 2, and sixth son <b>of</b> George III. <b>The</b> result <b>of</b> their labours was a reply to the Ancients in 1811 that the Grand Lodge had resolved to [...] "return to the Ancient Landmarks...when it should be ascertained what those ancient landmarks and obligations were." [...] Both Grand Lodges moved visibly towards union, forming committees to negotiate the precise terms. The main sticking point was <b>the</b> inability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancients' committee to decide anything without reporting back to a quarterly meeting of their own Grand Lodge. In October 1812, the Ancients allayed <b>the</b> frustration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moderns</b> by granting their commissioners full powers. Shortly after this, <b>the</b> Earl <b>of</b> Moira resigned as acting Grand Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moderns,</b> due to his appointment as Governor General of India. His successor was <b>the</b> Duke <b>of</b> Sussex, who became Grand Master the next January on <b>the</b> resignation <b>of</b> his brother, <b>the</b> Prince <b>of</b> Wales. On 1 December 1813, <b>the</b> Duke <b>of</b> Atholl ceded <b>the</b> leadership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancients to <b>the</b> Duke <b>of</b> Kent, <b>the</b> older brother <b>of</b> Sussex and <b>the</b> father <b>of</b> Queen Victoria. Kent had already presided over <b>the</b> union <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancients and <b>Moderns</b> in Canada, accomplished by the brutally simple expedient <b>of</b> merging <b>the</b> lodges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Moderns</b> with <b>the</b> nearest lodge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Ancients. <b>The</b> <b>Moderns</b> in Canada had simply ceased to exist. These two men oversaw the union in 1813 to form the United Grand Lodge <b>of</b> England, with <b>the</b> Duke <b>of</b> Sussex appointed as Grand Master <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new body.|$|R
