5|$|In other areas, {{such as the}} Mediterranean, some {{individuals}} have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form <b>of</b> <b>allergy</b> can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples.

In the case <b>of</b> <b>allergy</b> and celiac disease others recommend a dietary regimen is effective {{in the prevention of}} allergic diseases in high-risk infants, particularly in early infancy regarding food allergy and eczema. The most effective dietary regimen is exclusively breastfeeding for at least 4–6 months or, in absence of breast milk, formulas with documented reduced allergenicity for at least the first 4 months, combined with avoidance of solid food and cow's milk for the first 4 months.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> {{was increased}} {{in recent years}} in all countries in the world. Nutritional intake was one of the factors that could influence the incidence <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> in infants. Short breastfeeding could increase the incidence <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> {{in the first year of}} life. In addition, exclusive breastfeeding was estimated to have a preventive effect against the early development of allergic diseases. However, the research on the relationship of nutrition intake with the incidence <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> was still limited so that this research needs to be done. Aim: To determine whether nutrient intake at the age of 0 - 3 months was associated with the incidence <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> in infants and determine whether breastfeeding alone at the age of 0 - 3 months can reduce the incidence <b>of</b> <b>allergies.</b> Methods: Analytic observational study with prospective cohort study design since infants aged 0 to 3 months in 39 subjects who were only given breast milk, and 39 subjects were not only given breast milk. Subjects taken from four puskesmas, a hospital, and a maternity clinic in an urban area of Semarang. Data obtained from the questionnaires by subject’s parents which monitored every month for 3 months. Results: 56. 4...|$|R
40|$|International audienceINTRODUCTION: After having {{increased}} {{for some}} time, {{the prevalence of}} allergic diseases may have reached a plateau. During this increase, considerable concomitant changes in air pollution have occurred. Photo-oxidant air pollution, related to traffic, has become preponderant. The implication of air pollution in the epidemic <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> is still debated. BACKGROUND: Experimental {{studies have suggested that}} the effect of air pollutants, including particulates and ozone, on the worsening and even the induction <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> is biologically plausible. In addition, epidemiological studies have shown a short term impact of the peaks of air pollution on exacerbations of asthma. On the other hand, the results of epidemiological studies dealing with the long-term effects of chronic exposure to air pollution on the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> are less consistent. VIEWPOINTS: The implementation of new-born cohorts, the use of dispersion models to improve exposure assessment and the study of gene-environment correlations, should increase our knowledge of the role of traffic-related air pollutants in the development <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> and identify subjects more sensitive to their effects. CONCLUSIONS: Some traffic-related air pollutants may have played a more important role in the increase in the prevalence <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> than was assumed from the first epidemiological studies...|$|R
25|$|Sesame {{seeds and}} sesame oil are a serious {{allergen}} to some people, including infants. In Australia, the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>allergy</b> to sesame seed {{was estimated to}} be 0.42% among all children, while in the United Kingdom, the allergic reaction was found to affect 0.04% of adults. The occurrence <b>of</b> <b>allergy</b> to sesame in patients with some form of food allergy was found to be much higher than in the general population, ranging from 0.5% in Switzerland to 8.5% in Australia. In other words, allergy to sesame affects a small percentage of overall human population, but sesame allergy is high in people who already show symptoms <b>of</b> <b>allergy</b> to other foods.|$|E

25|$|Adverse {{reactions}} to local anesthetics (especially the esters) are not uncommon, but true allergy is very rare. Allergic {{reactions to}} the esters is usually due to a sensitivity to their metabolite, para-aminobenzoic acid, and does not result in cross-allergy to amides. Therefore, amides {{can be used as}} alternatives in those patients. Nonallergic reactions may resemble allergy in their manifestations. In some cases, skin tests and provocative challenge may be necessary to establish a diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>allergy.</b> Also cases <b>of</b> <b>allergy</b> to paraben derivatives occur, which are often added as preservatives to local anesthetic solutions.|$|E

40|$|As {{the subject}} of my Bachelors work I choose "Allergic {{diseases}} in relation to risk factors of the life style of children of younger school age in the region Karlovy Vary" because I think that allergies represent a topical problem which due to its nature affects not only children but also our whole society. The aim {{of the work is}} to find out how the selected life style factors share in the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> <b>of</b> children of younger school age in the region Karlovy Vary. The work comprises a theoretical and a practical part. The theoretical part comprises comprehensive theoretical knowledge from the field of allergology that should outline the conditions for the development <b>of</b> <b>allergies,</b> the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> in course <b>of</b> the life, the most common allergic diseases and their subsequent diagnosis and treatment. The practical part is devoted to the realised research which was carried out from November 2009 to January 2010 in regional towns and municipalities of the region Karlovy Vary. The research was performed using the form of the quantitative research, the inquiry method and as the data collection technique was used the anonymous questionnaire. The research file included children of younger school age from 4 th and 5 l classes of primary schools. As the results of the research show, the children who live in big cities have almost comparable occurrence <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> as the children from small villages. The results also show that the children who are the most exposed to a smoky environment at home have also the biggest occurrence <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> in contrast to the children who are not exposed to a tobacco environment at all and for whom predominate an absence <b>of</b> <b>allergies.</b> The investigation into whether the lack of microbes influences the occurrence <b>of</b> children <b>allergies</b> demonstrated in case of using disinfecting agents that shorter periods of their usage have an influence on the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> and to the contrary. The research also shows that elements which share in the character of housing have in case <b>of</b> <b>allergies</b> quite individual displays and therefore can not be denominated as significant factors in general. The results of this research can bring useful information to children allergists as well as wide public when the acquired knowledge can increase the interest in these problems and therefore improve preventive and repressive measures in this field...|$|R
