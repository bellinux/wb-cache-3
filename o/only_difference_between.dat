5|$|Neuro: Supernatural Detectives manga {{has been}} popular in Japan, {{frequently}} ranking {{in the weekly}} Top Ten list of best-selling manga. It has sold over four million volumes as of April 2009 in Japan. The anime, however, has been criticized by fans because it deviates from Matsui's work, and received a low viewership. Critics of anime and manga often compared it to Case Closed, noting supernatural themes as the <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> them.|$|E

5|$|According to legend, the Roman King Servius Tullius {{enacted a}} series of {{constitutional}} reforms in the 6th century BC. One of these reforms resulted {{in the creation of}} a new organizational unit with which to divide citizens. This unit, the Tribe, was based on geography rather than family, and was created to assist in future reorganizations of the army. In 471 BC, a law was passed which allowed the Plebeians to begin organizing by Tribe. Before this point, they had organized on the basis of the Curia. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the Plebeian Council after 471 BC and the ordinary Tribal Assembly (which also organized on the basis of the Tribes) was that the Tribes of the Plebeian Council only included Plebeians, whereas the Tribes of the Tribal Assembly included both Plebeians and Patricians.|$|E

In this way, the <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> respite and routine care is that the hospice pays the room and board charges of the facility. Should a patient receive respite in an inpatient hospice unit the care {{would be similar to}} what other patients of the hospice unit receive. Respite is provided for a maximum of five days every benefit period.|$|E

5|$|Bill Johnstona {{left arm}} bowler who could bowl both pace and spinwas not {{initially}} in Bradman's {{plan for the}} First Test at Trent Bridge. However, Bradman changed his mind on the morning when rain was forecast. Johnston was played {{in the hope of}} exploiting a wet wicket; he had previously taken match-winning figures of 10/40 and 11/117 against Yorkshire and Hampshire respectively on rain-affected surfaces. In addition, McCool had been struggling with an injury on his spinning finger, and Bradman was worried McCool would not have the endurance required for a five-day Test, which was two days longer than a normal tour match. Johnston's inclusion at the expense of McCool was the <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the team for the First Test and those against Worcestershire and the MCC. Johnston subsequently cemented his position by taking nine wickets in the matchthe most among the Australians. Johnson, the only specialist spinner chosen, took 1/85.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 2012, the Naga 2012 was released. Similarly to the Naga Epic, it came with {{interchangeable}} side panels. The Naga 2012 supported Razer's Synapse 2.0 software allowing all the buttons to be programmed and that information to be stored online. The other 2012 installment was the Naga Hex, the first mouse in the series to have only six programmable side-on buttons. Razer noted it was made for multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs), such as League of Legends and Diablo 3, instead of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). In May of the same year, the Wraith Red edition was released. The <b>only</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the versions was the coloring. In March 2013, after the announcement of a partnership between Razer and Riot Games, a League of Legends style Naga Hex was released, with the only difference being the design and the change from a plastic to a matte surface.|$|E
