5|$|Foliot was a canon <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln</b> Cathedral by 1147, and an {{official}} of Alexander <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> the Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> who secured Foliot's early promotions in the church. Foliot {{was sent to the}} Council of Reims in 1148 by the Lincoln cathedral chapter to learn Pope Eugene III's wishes regarding the vacant bishopric, as Alexander had died in February 1148. Henry of Blois, the Bishop of Winchester, was attempting to secure Lincoln for one of his nephews, but the pope agreed with the chapter and appointed Robert de Chesney as bishop instead. After his consecration, Chesney continued to employ Foliot as a clerk.|$|E

5|$|Alexander <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln</b> (died February 1148) was {{a medieval}} English Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> {{a member of}} an {{important}} administrative and ecclesiastical family. He was the nephew of Roger of Salisbury, a Bishop of Salisbury and Chancellor of England under King Henry I, and he was also related to Nigel, Bishop of Ely. Educated at Laon, Alexander served in his uncle's diocese as an archdeacon in the early 1120s. Unlike his relatives, he held no office in the government before his appointment as Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln</b> in 1123. Alexander became a frequent visitor to King Henry's court after his elevation to the episcopate, often witnessing royal documents, and he served as a royal justice in Lincolnshire.|$|E

5|$|Blois was {{frequently}} {{a witness to}} Puiset's charters, and was named as rector of a parish church {{in the city of}} Durham, appointed by Puiset. By the late 1180s, Blois had moved to the household of Hugh of Avalon, the Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln.</b> Blois was a subdean, an ecclesiastical official, of the diocese <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln</b> by 22 March 1194, probably from about 1189. He was a frequent witness to Hugh's charters in the late 1180s. Although he was now serving Hugh, Blois did not entirely quit the service of Puiset, and was present at Puiset's deathbed in 1195. He was named precentor <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln</b> in 1197, in succession to the medieval writer Walter Map. Besides Hugh and Puiset, he also served Pope Innocent III. He may be the Master William of Blois who is a witness to some Scottish charters.|$|E
5|$|Coutances {{was elected}} to the see <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln</b> on 8 May 1183, {{selected}} by King Henry over three other candidates. He was ordained a priest on 11 June 1183 and consecrated bishop on 3 July 1183 at Angers by Richard of Dover, the Archbishop of Canterbury. He was enthroned at Lincoln Cathedral on 11 December 1183. While at Lincoln, Coutances took part in the election of Baldwin of Forde as the new Archbishop of Canterbury, which took place at a council held in Westminster in 1184. Writing about Coutances' time at Lincoln, Gerald of Wales accused the bishop of increasing the debt of the diocese <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln</b> and of squandering its resources. Coutances helped the schools in the city <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> acting as the patron for scholars such as John of Tynemouth and Simon of Southwell.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 1720s, a {{constitutional}} struggle began between the Provost and the Fellows, {{culminating in a}} lawsuit. In 1721, Henry Edmunds was elected as a Fellow by 9 votes to 3; his election was rejected by Provost George Carter, and on appeal, by the Visitor, Edmund Gibson, then Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln.</b> The Provost continued to reject candidates, fuelling discontent among the Fellows, until a writ of attachment against the Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln</b> was heard between 1724 and 1726. The opposing Fellows, led by Edmunds, appealed to the original statutes, claiming the Crown as Visitor, making Gibson's decisions invalid; Provost Carter, supported by Bishop Gibson, appealed to the second versiont, claiming the Bishop <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln</b> as Visitor. The jury decided for the Fellows, supporting the original charter of Edward II.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Bloet's consecration, the Archbishop of York, Thomas of Bayeux, who had {{previously}} had a claim to supervise the see <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> tried to prevent the Archbishop Anselm's consecrating Bloet. Thomas argued that the area of Lindsey, which was within the diocese <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln,</b> really belonged to the archdiocese of York. The medieval chronicler Hugh the Chanter alleged that Bloet gave Rufus £3,000 to intervene on Bloet's side when Thomas attempted to assert York's claim to Lindsey, but another medieval chronicler, Henry of Huntingdon, who knew Bloet well, said that the sum was £5,000. This payment secured Rufus' support in the dispute between York and Lincoln, which was settled in Lincoln's favour. The sum of £5,000 was extremely large, eight times what Domesday Book records as the bishop of Lincoln's annual income. The king gave York the abbeys of Selby and St Oswald, Gloucester {{in return for the}} settlement in favour <b>of</b> <b>Lincoln.</b> Bloet also refused to profess obedience to Anselm, but when King William intervened on Anselm's side, Bloet made the profession to Anselm.|$|E
