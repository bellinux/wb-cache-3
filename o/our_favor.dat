[...] After the Fall of Saigon {{and the end of the}} Vietnam War, the communist government awarded him the same title and paid war pensions to his family, claiming him as one of their own.

Tảng believed Thảo [...] "was a man who throughout his life fought single-mindedly for Vietnam's independence". Tảng, who later abandoned communism, said that Thảo [...] "was a nationalist, not an ideologue", and credited him with turning the military tide towards the communists by helping to bring down Diệm and fomenting chronic instability and infighting for 18 months. Hồ Chí Minh had reacted to Diệm's death by saying [...] "I can scarcely believe that the Americans would be so stupid".

500|$|The 2002–03 season saw Duncan enjoy another {{standout}} {{season in}} which he averaged 23.3 points, a career-high 12.9 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.9 blocks per game, and yet another dual All-NBA and All-Defense First Team call-up, resulting in his second NBA Most Valuable Player Award. At age 37, Robinson announced that year as his last season, and his playing time was cut by coach Popovich to save his energy for the playoffs. The Spurs qualified easily for the playoffs, concluding the regular season as the Conference number one seed with a 60–22 record. Although San Antonio now had new offensive threats in Tony Parker and Manu Ginóbili, during the playoffs, it was Duncan's performance in the semi-finals against the Los Angeles Lakers which was singled out for praise by Popovich, who stated: [...] "I thought in Game 5 and Game 6, he [...] was astounding in his focus. He pulled everyone along these last two games." [...] In the series, Duncan was matched up against forward Robert Horry, {{and was able to}} dominate him the entire series and closed out the series in style; Duncan finished Game 6 with 37 points and 16 rebounds, allowing Spurs coach Popovich to call timeout with 2:26 left to instruct his team not to celebrate excessively. The Spurs made it to the finals, and defeated the New Jersey Nets 88–77 in Game 6 to win another NBA championship. Helped by an inspired Robinson, Duncan almost recorded a quadruple double in the final game, and was named the NBA Finals MVP. Duncan said of the victory: [...] "We were all confident that something would happen, that we would turn the game to <b>our</b> <b>favor,</b> and it did", but felt sad that Robinson retired after winning his second championship ring. Following this successful Spurs campaign, Robinson and Duncan were named Sports Illustrateds 2003 [...] "Sportsmen of the Year".|$|E

Wright told General Meade, [...] "General, I don't want Mott's troops on my left; they are not a support. I would rather have no troops there." [...] He assigned Hancock's II Corps to the assault on the Mule Shoe, while Burnside's IX Corps attacked the eastern end of the salient and Warren's V Corps and Wright's VI Corps applied pressure to Laurel Hill.

EA's COO, John Schappert, said that the Q4 NFS title was, [...] "a new action based Need for Speed from our Criterion Studio," [...] in a post-financial report conference call. The title was officially revealed as Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit at EA's Media Briefing during E3 2010, with a trailer which showed a high-speed police chase involving three different racers. The trailer was followed by a live demo of the game on stage between creative director Craig Sullivan as a cop and producer Matt Webster as a racer.

40|$|The intergalactic medium (IGM) is the {{dominant}} reservoir of baryons at all cosmic epochs. We investigate {{the evolution of the}} IGM from z= 2 - 0 in 48 Mpc/h, 110 -million particle cosmological hydrodynamic simulations using three prescriptions for galactic outflows. We focus on the evolution of IGM physical properties, and how such properties are traced by Ly-alpha absorption as detectable using HST/COS. Our results broadly confirm the canonical picture that most Ly-alpha absorbers arise from highly ionized gas tracing filamentary large-scale structure. Growth of structure causes gas to move from the diffuse photoionized IGM into other cosmic phases, namely stars, cold and hot gas within galaxy halos, and the unbound and shock-heated warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). By today, baryons are roughly equally divided between bound phases (35 %), the diffuse IGM (41 %), and the WHIM (24 %). Here we (re) define the WHIM as gas with overdensities lower than that in halos and temperatures > 10 ^ 5 K, in order to more closely align it with "missing baryons". When we tune our photoionizing background to match the observed evolution of the Ly-alpha mean flux decrement, we obtain a line count evolution that broadly agrees with available data. We predict a column density distribution slope of - 1. 70 for <b>our</b> <b>favored</b> momentum-driven wind model, in agreement with recent observations, and it becomes shallower with redshift. With improved statistics, the frequency of strong lines can be a valuable diagnostic of outflows, and <b>our</b> <b>favored</b> wind model matches existing data best among our models. The relationship between column density and physical density is fairly tight from z= 2 - 0, and evolves as rho N_HI^ 0. 74 10 ^(- 0. 37 z) for diffuse absorbers. Linewidths only loosely reflect the temperature of the absorbing gas, which will hamper attempts to quantify the WHIM using broad Ly-alpha absorbers.
