This paper investigates an explanation of sales {{as a way for}} uninformed consumers to be willing to experience the product, and learn about its fit, and where informed consumers may forget about (or change) their preferences. We investigate the role of the rate <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> forgetting on the timing between sales, and of the rate <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> learning and menu costs on the length of a sale. The rate <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> forgetting can be linked to the length of purchase cycle and the level <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> involvement.

It was also being used by tradesmen to preserve perishable good, rather than for direct consumption. Tudor looked beyond his existing suppliers to Maine and even to harvesting from passing icebergs, but neither source proved practical. Instead, Tudor teamed up with Nathaniel Wyeth to exploit the ice supplies of Boston on a more industrial scale. Wyeth devised a new form of horse-pulled ice-cutter in 1825 that cut square blocks of ice more efficiently than previous methods. He agreed to supply Tudor from Fresh Pond in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reducing the cost of harvesting ice from 30 cents ($7.30) a ton (901kg) to only 10 cents ($2.40). Sawdust to insulate the ice was brought from Maine, at $16,000 ($390,000) a year.|$|E

The new breakfast line was designed to be portable, because studies had shown that an increasing percent <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> were eating breakfast on the go. Shortly after the introduction of the French toast stick products, BK partnered with Lender's Bagels to introduce a bagel breakfast sandwich.

5|$|The coin, {{known as}} the Eisenhower dollar, proved unpopular with the public, and {{very few of the}} coins were found in circulation. In 1976, the Research Triangle Institute {{conducted}} a survey of United States coinage. Among other things, they recommended the half dollar, which also saw little use, be entirely eliminated from production, {{and the size of the}} dollar be reduced. Their report read in part: A conveniently-sized dollar coin would significantly broaden the capabilities <b>of</b> <b>consumers</b> for cash transactions, especially with machines. Members of the automatic merchandising industry have expressed a strong interest in a smaller dollar, indicating their willingness to adapt their machinery to its use. Numismatic historian David L. Ganz suggested that Eisenhower, a Republican, was chosen as a means of balancing the half dollar, depicting Democrat John F. Kennedy. In a 1977 paper, he agreed with the findings of the Institute, suggesting that both coins should be eliminated; the half dollar production ceased entirely, and the dollar replaced by one of smaller diameter and with a different design. Treasury officials desired the small dollar coin as a cost-saving measure; Mint Director Stella Hackel estimated that replacing half of the issued dollar bills with small dollars would save $19 million ($ today) in annual production costs.|$|E

40|$|I {{suggest that}} in order to re-ignite the {{evolution}} of the concept <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> values and, in turn, broaden its application, increase its employment, and, ultimately, raise its significance, a new conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> values which improves our understanding of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> values is needed. The purpose of this research, therefore, was to develop a new conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> values. In order to do so, the research explored the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> values in the high-fidelity audio microculture, using a research design which was guided by hermeneutics and which drew on axiology. The result was a meaning-based conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> values which suggests that consumer value is the meaning which is ascribed to a product as the result <b>of</b> the <b>consumer’s</b> valuation <b>of</b> the product. Valuation is a judgement process in which the consumer considers the characterisation of the product vis-à-vis his/her interest. Characterisation is the descriptive/appraisive meaning which the consumer ascribes to the product. Interest is a mental disposition - the meaningful standard to which the consumer appeals. Interest arises from appetence, and accompanies, stimulates, and directs valuative attention toward the product. Appetence is an instinctive and unconscious tendency. And attention is intentional meaning-making cognitive activity. The research contributes to the discipline of marketing by offering this meaning-based conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> values which improves our understanding of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> values, thereby providing new insights into both the property of value and the process of valuation. It challenges long-standing assumptions of the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> values in the discipline of marketing, and offers a more contextually- and culturally-attuned alternative to the economics-oriented conceptualisations <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> value which have dominated the discipline of marketing. This meaning-based conceptualisation <b>of</b> <b>consumer</b> values, in combination with a microcultural analysis, constitutes a viable approach for understanding the links between products and consumers’ motivating structures. The research also lends support to the constitutive relationship between the distinct patterns of a microculture and the broader historical context <b>of</b> postmodern <b>consumer</b> culture. Additionally, it affords a richer understanding <b>of</b> how <b>consumers</b> use the distinct patterns of a microculture as frames of reference in the valuation of products, and conversely, how this valuation, in turn, helps to shape these distinct patterns.
