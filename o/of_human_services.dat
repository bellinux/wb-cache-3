5|$|At {{that time}} the {{shutdown}} began, all state government spending and operations {{not considered to be}} critical stopped. Suspended state services included driving tests, childcare assistance, senior and disability linkage lines, criminal background checks, and road construction. State government offices, state parks, highway rest areas, and sites run by the Minnesota Historical Society, among others, closed. The commissioner of the Department <b>of</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Services,</b> Lucinda Jesson, said that letters had to be sent to over 580,000 households that relied on the department for social services to notify them about the possible shutdown. More critical parts of the state government, including public safety, health care, benefit payments, and care for residents of state facilities continued. Services that were continued during the shutdown could have amounted to as much as 80 percent of state spending.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, {{sales of}} spirits {{increased}} 9% {{over the previous}} year. Whiskey and vodka were the top sellers, while tequila had the largest percentage increase. Oregonian's top buy was Jack Daniel's, with 412,000 bottles sold. This was during a national spirits trend where manufacturers introduced new products and advertising aimed at young drinkers. Again in 2007, Oregon's 2.6 million adults on average drank 32 gallons of beer each, versus 4 gallons of wine and 2 gallons of spirits, but sales of beer hadn't increased like sales of spirits. The Oregon Department <b>of</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Services</b> reported that while drinking among 8th11th graders has fallen nationally, it has increased in Oregon.

5|$|The American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the United Way {{and other}} {{charitable}} groups also quickly mobilized volunteers to assist survivors {{in the aftermath}} across the regions affected.

Emergency assistance was also offered by the Tennessee Department <b>of</b> <b>Human</b> <b>Services</b> for low income victims in the counties affected by the tornadoes. In addition, the Nashville Predators announced that for their game on February 7 against the Tampa Bay Lightning, half the ticket sales revenue would be donated to the American Red Cross to help with their efforts, and that fans could make additional donations to Red Cross volunteers at the arena's main entrances. The National Football League's Tennessee Titans along with the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management of Nashville organized a donation drive during the weekend of February 9 at LP Field.|$|E

40|$|The {{advent of}} post-industrialism in western {{societies}} saw social theorists pay greater attention to the blurring of traditional work and life conceptual categories and the growing role of service professions. Further, much of the theorisation around the <b>human</b> <b>service</b> professions has focussed on occupational stress and professional burnout. This focus on the challenges to worker health has limited considerations <b>of</b> how <b>human</b> <b>service</b> professionals can thrive, and not just survive, in demanding employment contexts. In response, the paper considers the ‘lifeworld’ as a conceptual resource that can encourage new {{ways of thinking about}} the work <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>service</b> professionals, as well as reworks this resource using the concept of affect to expand consideration of the interconnected, inter-subjective, bodily and emotive nature <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>service</b> work.
