500|$|Thomas Riley Marshall {{was born}} in North Manchester, Indiana, on March 14, 1854. Two years later, a sister was born, but she died in infancy. Martha had {{contracted}} tuberculosis, which Daniel {{believed to be the}} cause of their infant daughter's poor health. While Marshall was still a young boy, his family moved several times in search of a good climate for Daniel to attempt different [...] "outdoor cures" [...] <b>on</b> <b>Martha.</b> They moved first to Quincy, Illinois in 1857. While the family was living in Illinois, Daniel Marshall, [...] a supporter of the American Union and a staunch Democrat, and took his four-year-old son, Thomas, to the Lincoln and Douglas debate in Freeport in 1858. Marshall later recalled that during the rally he sat on the laps of Stephen Douglas and Abraham Lincoln, alternating between the two candidates when they were not speaking, and remembered it as one of his earliest and most cherished memories.|$|E

2500|$|Later in 1946, Scott's moniker proved prophetic, when a 37-year-old Barbara Stanwyck, in a letter, {{objected to}} Scott's top billing in The Strange Love of Martha Ivers (1946): [...] "I {{will not be}} co-starred with any other person other than a {{recognized}} male or female star." [...] Lawyers for Wallis and Stanwyck got to work, and eventually, the final billing ran Stanwyck, Van Heflin, and Scott at the top, with newcomer Kirk Douglas in second place, but Wallis' interest in promoting Scott was obsessive.

2500|$|Given {{that many}} Freemasons {{are members of}} Lions Clubs, and its founder, Melvin Jones, was also a Freemason, modern {{conspiracy}} theories have claimed that the Lions are connected to and act cohesively with Freemasonry. One example is found <b>on</b> <b>Martha</b> F. Lee's Conspiracy Rising: Conspiracy Thinking and American Public Life. It says that the [...] "Freemasons are apparently in cahoots with the Lions Clubs and involved in plots ranging from the distribution of aspartame to control the human mind, {{to the death of}} John Paul I, to an apparent plot to spread Zionism." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the closing}} scene of [...] "Doomsday", a mysterious bride (Catherine Tate) inexplicably appears in his TARDIS. The 2006 Christmas special sees the Doctor and bride-to-be Donna Noble save the Earth; Donna saves the Doctor from {{going too far}} in his revenge against the alien Racnoss and declines his offer of {{companion}}ship. In the 2007 series, the Doctor takes <b>on</b> <b>Martha</b> Jones (Freema Agyeman) as his new companion. Together, they witness the mysterious Face of Boe (Struan Rodger) prophesy to the Doctor that [...] "you are not alone." [...] They are rejoined by former companion Captain Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) in a three-episode adventure where presumed-deceased archenemy and fellow Time Lord the Master (John Simm) becomes Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and enslaves the Doctor for one year. Martha's plan sees the Doctor infused with the world's psychic energies, and he easily defeats the Master, who seemingly refuses to regenerate and dies in the Doctor's arms. Following this adventure, in the dénouement of series finale [...] "Last of the Time Lords", Jack and Martha both depart the TARDIS, and the Doctor is shocked to see {{what appears to be}} the RMS Titanic crash into it. Set moments prior, another Children in Need mini-episode, [...] "Time Crash", features a brief encounter between Tennant's Tenth Doctor and the Fifth Doctor (Peter Davison), containing meta-humour surrounding the fact David Tennant had watched and loved Davison's doctor as a child. In parallel with the third series, Tennant lends his voice to the animated serial The Infinite Quest.|$|E

The {{people at the}} manor were strict in their {{religious}} observances, {{and it had been}} impressed <b>on</b> <b>Martha</b> that she had better attend at morning service on her first Sunday, and a girl was found by one of her neighbours to look after the baby in the meantime. And so when Sunday came she dressed herself in her best clothes and went to church with the others. The service over, the squire and his wife came out first and were standing in the path exchanging greetings with their friends; then as the others came out with Martha {{in the midst of the}} crowd the lady turned and fixed her eyes on her, and suddenly stepping out from the group she stopped Martha and said, [...] "Who are you?--I don't remember your face." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was well}} that Mrs. Furnival came back so quickly {{to her own}} house, as it saved the scandal of any {{domestic}} quarrel before her daughter. On the following day Sophia returned, and as harmony {{was at that time}} reigning in Harley Street, there was no necessity that she should be presumed to know anything of what had occurred. That she did know,--know exactly what her mother had done, and why she had done it, and how she had come back, leaving Martha Biggs dumfounded by her return, is very probable, for Sophia Furnival was a clever girl, and one who professed to understand the inns and outs of her own family,--and perhaps of some other families. But she behaved very prettily to her papa and mamma on the occasion, never dropping a word which could lead either of them to suppose that she had interrogated Rachel, been confidential with the housemaid, conversed on the subject--even with Spooner, and made a morning call <b>on</b> <b>Martha</b> Biggs herself.|$|E
