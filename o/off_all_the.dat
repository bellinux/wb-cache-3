5|$|In the 1950s Dutch elm disease (Ceratocystis ulmi) killed <b>off</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> elms {{that once}} {{populated}} {{the park and}} crab apples were planted to replace the elms along the pedestrian mall. After deteriorating over the decades Washington Park saw a revival in the 1990s and 2000s with the flower beds being restored to their original specifications, the pedestrian mall removed of pavement and widened to its original dimensions with disease-resistant elms planted to form a canopy, the King Fountain relit at night, and the lilac shrub border around {{the periphery of the}} park being restored.|$|E
5|$|SR 50, the Paradise Parkway, {{was part}} of Proposition 300 in 1985, but {{was removed from the}} system in December 1994, when then Arizona {{governor}} Fife Symington made some funding cuts that included removal of the Paradise Parkway and Estrella Freeway from the system entirely. (The Estrella Freeway was re-added to the system when Proposition 400 was passed ten years later in 2004.) Route 50 will not be re-added to the system, because in February 1996 the ADOT auctioned <b>off</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> right-of-way it had purchased for the freeway, which was to be located between Loop 101 and Route 51 in the Central Valley.|$|E
5|$|Though Dhumavati {{may seem}} to be a goddess to be avoided due to her inauspiciousness, she is {{described}} as tender-hearted and one who gives her devotees whatever they want. In several places, Dhumavati is described as a giver of siddhis (supernatural powers), a rescuer from all troubles and granter of all desires and rewards, including ultimate knowledge and moksha (salvation). Dhumavati's worship is prescribed to ward <b>off</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> negativity that she stands for and to transcend the smoke screen to acquire true knowledge. By worshipping and confronting her, the embodiment of the impure, the inauspicious and outside the fringes of society, one can look beyond the arbitrary dichotomies of society and acquire ultimate knowledge to become spiritually enlightened.|$|E

25|$|Pseudotsuga macrocarpa, {{has several}} {{features}} to tolerate and survive wildfire, notably the very thick bark, {{and the presence}} of numerous adventitious buds on the upper side of the branches; this enables the trees to survive even crown fires which burn <b>off</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> branchlets, the apparently dead trees becoming green again the following spring. Wildfire frequencies in the chaparral habitats in which it often grows typically range from 15-50 year intervals. Bigcone Douglas-fir is closely associated with canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis) and often establishes itself in its shade; after about 50 years, it emerges above the oak canopy.|$|E
25|$|You shouldn't make friends. It's not a {{good thing}} to be friends with people you're covering. There's just no point in doing it. It's tempting, but they're not going to {{consider}} you their friend anyway. They just know that you're somebody that can do something for them. So you shouldn't really flatter yourself that they want to be your buddy. They don't... They want you for some reason or other, {{and you just have to}} fend that <b>off</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> time. And you can't really cover people critically that you're friends with. How would that work? That would be bad. So you always have to keep that in mind.|$|E
25|$|It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} why the Virginia Indians did not occupy the site: Jamestown Island, then a peninsula, is a swampy area, and its {{isolation from the}} mainland meant that there was limited hunting available, as most game animals required larger foraging areas. The settlers quickly hunted and killed <b>off</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> large and smaller game animals that {{were found on the}} tiny peninsula. In addition, the low, marshy area was infested with airborne pests, including mosquitoes, which carried malaria, and the brackish water of the tidal James River was not a good source of water. Over 135 settlers died from malaria, and drinking the salinated and contaminated water caused many to suffer from saltwater poisoning, fevers, and dysentery.|$|E

25|$|The walled garden {{contains}} a greenhouse and potting sheds {{along the north}} wall and a heated outdoor wall which runs {{a quarter of the}} length of the east wall. The gardeners grew exotic plants and fruit trees in the greenhouses. The apple trees {{at the south end of}} the walled garden survived and compromise Laxton's Superb (c.1922), Worcester Pearmain (c.1870), Newton Wonder (c.1890), Bismarck (c.1870), Bramley (c.1809), White Transparent (c.1870), Golden Delicious (c.1914) and Crimson Bramley (c.1913). As of 2013 grafts have been taken <b>off</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> fruit trees so that the garden can be restocked with these varieties when the garden is restored. In late 2013 a Mere de Menage (c.1700) tree was found in an old orchard outside the walled garden.|$|E
25|$|Liquidation is {{the normal}} {{means by which}} a company's {{existence}} is brought to an end. It is also referred to (either alternatively or concurrently) in some jurisdictions as winding up or dissolution. Liquidations generally come in two forms, either compulsory liquidations (sometimes called creditors' liquidations) and voluntary liquidations (sometimes called members' liquidations, although a voluntary liquidation where the company is insolvent will also be controlled by the creditors, and is properly {{referred to as a}} creditors' voluntary liquidation). Where a company goes into liquidation, normally a liquidator is appointed to gather in all the company's assets and settle all claims against the company. If there is any surplus after paying <b>off</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> creditors of the company, this surplus is then distributed to the members.|$|E
25|$|Claxton {{remembered that}} a private {{passage from the}} leading lady's {{dressing}} room ran through the basement to the box office, and through that she and fellow actress Maude Harrison bypassed much of the crush in the lobby. Murdoch and Claude Burroughs thought there was sufficient time to grab street clothing from their dressing rooms − it was December and their stage costumes were flimsy. For want of creature comfort they became trapped and did not escape. Some actors and stage hands left by the utility doors exiting onto Johnson Street, but the fire on the stage soon became widespread, cutting those exits <b>off.</b> <b>All</b> <b>the</b> remaining exits were {{in the front of}} the house, the main entrance exiting onto Washington street or the special exit doors leading into Flood's Alley.|$|E

25|$|In {{response}} to Twain's specific allegations, Ament said:The clan in China {{is responsible for}} the individuals and in collecting from the clans we did only what it is the settled policy of the Chinese themselves to do. It would have been impossible to have done otherwise....As to the 'extra' indemnities, we had to provide them for the widows and orphans left penniless and homeless, and who had lost no property to be paid for because they had none. We collected an extra one-third with the consent of the authorities, and distributed it among these people....It was considered perfectly just and fair by everyone there. Then, too, we had to provide for these people, and so we went to the abandoned grain shops and took what we could find. If we had not done so the Chinese would have. We promised to pay for everything we took. We also sold <b>off</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> furniture and goods in the place and used the money to support our Christians. I have been surprised to hear that this was criticised.|$|E
25|$|It is next {{mentioned}} in 344 BC, {{when it was}} one of the first cities that declared in favor of Timoleon after his landing in Sicily. At a later period we find it mentioned as espousing the cause of Hieron, and supporting him during his war against the Mamertines, 269 BC. On that occasion he rested his position upon Tyndaris on the left, and on Tauromenium (modern Taormina) on the right. Indeed, the strong position of Tyndaris made it an important strategic post on the Tyrrhenian sea, as Tauromenium was on the Sicilian sea, and hence we find it frequently {{mentioned in}} accounts of subsequent wars. In the First Punic War it was at first dependent upon Carthage; and though the citizens, alarmed at the progress of the Roman armies, were at one time on the point of turning to Rome, they were restrained by the Carthaginians, who carried <b>off</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> chief citizens as hostages. In 257 BC, the Battle of Tyndaris took place off the coast of Tyndaris, between the city and the Liparaean islands, in which a Roman fleet under Gaius Atilius Regulus obtained some advantage over the Carthaginian fleet, but without any decisive result. The Roman fleet is described on that occasion as touching at the promontory of Tyndaris, but the city had not yet fallen into their hands, and it was not until after the fall of Panormus (modern Palermo) in 254 BC that Tyndaris expelled the Carthaginian garrison and joined the Roman alliance.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} Test, played at Edgbaston, Hobbs opened the batting with MacLaren but was dismissed, {{from the first}} ball he received, by Charlie Macartney for a duck. However, the match was a low-scoring one on a pitch which made batting difficult, and Australia left England needing 105 to win. The task was not easy in the conditions, but Hobbs, this time opening the batting with C. B. Fry, hit 62 not out. He scored quickly <b>off</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> bowlers and England passed the target without losing a wicket. This innings meant that he had scored 919 runs {{before the end of}} May, but he failed to emulate W. G. Grace's {{achievement}} of scoring 1,000 runs in May when Nottinghamshire batted throughout the day when Surrey played them on 31 May. England lost the second Test by nine wickets, their team much changed to the bafflement of critics and spectators, and Hobbs scored just 19 and 9. The home side also lost the third Test. Hobbs scored 12 and 30, the latter the highest score of the innings, but was involved in controversy in the first innings when he appeared to change his mind when about to walk off after apparently hitting his own wicket. The umpire ruled him not out, to the fury of the Australians who loudly protested for some time. Hobbs was out to a very straightforward delivery almost immediately after; some critics, including the Australian captain, believed he allowed himself to be dismissed because he thought the umpire was wrong, but Hobbs later wrote that the incident unsettled him and he lost concentration.|$|E
