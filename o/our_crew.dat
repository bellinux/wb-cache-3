500|$|In an {{interview}} to publicise the final episode of Voyager, [...] "Endgame", Beltran said, [...] "We all had a great relationship {{with each other and}} we've all said how much we enjoy <b>our</b> <b>crew.</b> We have a terrific crew. But at the same time, I'm looking forward to what's next. It's exciting to know that something unknown is next." [...] The final episode introduced a romance between Seven of Nine and Chakotay. Ryan found this confusing for the characters, as although it had been suggested in the episode [...] "", the producers told the pair to forget about the relationship in the in-between episodes until the finale.|$|E
500|$|In June 2013, the Ontario Ministry of Labour charged Live Nation Canada Inc, Live Nation Ontario Concerts GP Inc, Optex Staging & Services Inc and an {{engineer}} with 13 charges under the Occupational Health and Safety Act. The hearing began in November 2015. In June 2017, a mistrial was declared {{and a new}} trial ordered after the judge {{was appointed to the}} Ontario Superior Court and lost jurisdiction. In September 2017, charges were stayed due to court delays. Radiohead released a statement saying: [...] "We are appalled by the decision … This is an insult to the memory of Scott Johnson, his parents and <b>our</b> <b>crew.</b> It offers no consolation, closure or assurance that this kind of accident will not happen again." ...|$|E
500|$|Doherty and Iswarienko {{purchased}} a RED camera to film the series. According to Doherty, {{they decided to}} purchase the camera equipment themselves to make the show [...] "a cut above the rest as far as <b>our</b> <b>crew</b> and how it looks". She described the filming technique as allowing for a more-authentic look into her life: [...] "It had to be honest, {{it had to be}} truthful, and it had to look fantastic". Asked by an interviewer about rumors that she was a [...] "bridezilla", Doherty said that the series would show all aspects of her preparation for the wedding and was meant to be revealing. Its opening ("Everyone thinks they know you") was described by Doherty as another way to show her real life, in contrast with her reputation for being difficult.|$|E
5000|$|Cagri Vila Lostuvali, 10 {{years in}} the {{business}} and four as a director, adds: [...] "To deliver one episode per week <b>our</b> <b>crews</b> work up to 18 hours a day. This job eats up our entire lives." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} year (1991-92), with Laurie McGuane still president, Gregory Rubbo VP, Chris McBride [...] "purser," [...] and Meg Murphy, secretary, Glenn continued {{to serve as}} coach of the novice women, Ed McCormick coached our men, and Bill our varsity women. In the spring semester, Doug Sanders, who was a grad student in physics at CUA, became the coach of all <b>our</b> <b>crews.</b>|$|R
60|$|It {{was about}} a month after this that all <b>our</b> <b>crews</b> got together, and as Avery was unshipped, we all agreed to bring our own company into the Portuguese {{man-of-war}} and the sloop, and give Captain Avery the Spanish frigate, with all the tackles and furniture, guns and ammunition, for his crew by themselves; for which they, being full of wealth, agreed to give us 40,000 pieces of eight.|$|R
500|$|Despite Shatner's doubts, Nimoy and Bennett {{selected}} a time travel {{story in which}} the Enterprise crew encounters a problem {{that could only be}} fixed by something only available in the present day (the Star Trek characters' past). They considered ideas about violin makers and oil drillers, or a disease that had its cure destroyed with the rainforests. [...] "But the depiction of thousands of sick and dying people seemed rather gruesome for our light-hearted film, and the thought of <b>our</b> <b>crew</b> taking a 600-year round trip just to bring back a snail darter wasn't all that thrilling," [...] explained Nimoy. The director read a book on extinct animals and conceived the storyline that was eventually adopted. Nimoy hit upon the idea of humpback whales after talking with a friend—their song added mystery to the story, and their size added logistical challenges the heroes would have to overcome.|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the episode is one of Fey's {{favorite}} words, which she used multiple times when she appeared as an anchor on the Saturday Night Live sketch Weekend Update. Fey explains that she likes the word because [...] "it's {{one of the least}} graphic ways to describe the female genitals". This episode marks the final appearance of Edie Falco, who was hired for a three-episode arc. Falco made her debut in the episode [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] as Celeste Cunningham, a Congresswoman and romantic interest of Jack's. She appeared in [...] "Secrets and Lies", where James Carville helps the fledgling relationship. The pair breaks up in Episode 210, when they realize their careers prevent them from staying together. Falco said that she was [...] "thrilled for the opportunity to work with such great comic actors", and expressed her enjoyment of watching the series. Fey was [...] "thrilled to have such an amazing actress come join us", and joked that [...] "a lot of guys on <b>our</b> <b>crew</b> want The Sopranos ending explained to them", in which Falco was a series star.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Stewart {{thought that}} the first Next Generation film, Star Trek Generations, was too much like a {{television}} episode but thought that his character, Captain Jean-Luc Picard, was redefined as a [...] "movie hero" [...] in [...] He was concerned that in the new film, the character would return to that seen in the television series. Michael Piller said that he felt {{that in order to}} be a hero, Picard [...] "should be acting out of a moral and ethical mindset, and stand for principles that are important to mankind". Stewart was later pleased with the film's romantic sub-plot, calling it [...] "charming" [...] and saying that he was [...] "feeling very good about it." [...] He {{thought that the}} film had a lighter tone than previous films, saying, [...] "It shows <b>our</b> <b>crew</b> having a little more fun than we normally see them doing". Stewart was disappointed that a scene in which Picard and Anij kiss was cut from {{the final version of the}} film, saying that [...] "It was a studio decision, but still somewhat inexplicable to me as I feel the audience were waiting for some kind of romantic culmination to the relationship, which did happen and was extremely pleasant." [...] Stewart received a producer's credit on the film.|$|E
2500|$|Willie Walsh, the British Airways Chief Executive, {{released}} a statement praising {{the actions of the}} [...] "flight and cabin crew [...] did a magnificent job and safely evacuated all of the 136 passengers ... The captain of the aircraft is one of our most experienced and has been flying with us for nearly 20 years. <b>Our</b> <b>crews</b> are trained to deal with these situations." [...] He also praised the fire, ambulance and police services.|$|R
25|$|In early 1992, {{squadron}} {{crews and}} aircraft began participating in Operation Provide Hope, helping to deliver hundreds {{of tons of}} food and medicine to the former Soviet Union. By August, Operation Provide Relief (later known as Restore Hope), rushing food supplies to the starving people of Somalia, the relief of victims of Hurricane Andrew in our own country, and relief efforts for the Guamanian victims of typhoon Omar kept <b>our</b> <b>crews</b> and aircraft on the move.|$|R
5000|$|Brimming with exuberance, hipness {{and stylish}} editing, American High boasts {{authenticity}} {{as well as}} addictive drama. [...] "They trusted <b>our</b> <b>crews</b> {{to tell their stories}} truthfully and honestly," [...] says producer Cutler of the students. [...] "I wanted this to be as honest as any of the best cinéma vérité documentaries." [...] And Cutler has succeeded, with scenes that are often brutally frank. The footage from the students’ own video diaries is among the most fascinating.|$|R
2500|$|In 1998, Thompson and Colburn {{returned}} {{to the village of}} Sơn Mỹ, where they met some of the people they saved during the killings, including Thi Nhung and Pham Thi Nhanh, two women who {{had been part of the}} group about to be killed by Brooks's 2nd Platoon. Thompson said to the survivors, [...] "I just wish <b>our</b> <b>crew</b> that day could have helped more people than we did." [...] Thompson and Colburn lit incense sticks and placed them in an urn by a stone marker at the irrigation ditch where many were murdered. They also dedicated a new elementary school for the children of the village.|$|E
2500|$|The {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, {{where the first}} five years of The X-Files had been filmed and produced before the series had moved to Los Angeles, was an early idea; one that seemed right to both Chris Carter and David Duchovny. According to Duchovny, [...] "It all makes sense. You know, when Chris and I first talked about doing this movie, we kind of unconsciously both said, 'You know, I guess it should be in Vancouver, it really should be,' and it just felt like you know, almost superstitiously like the right thing to do." [...] Filming in Vancouver also facilitated the return of many former crew members who had previously worked on The X-Files, as well as individuals who had worked on the other series that Ten Thirteen Productions had created. Frank Spotnitz said that [...] "In terms of making of the movie, we've brought together as many people as we can, not just from The X-Files but from all the shows that we did here in Vancouver – Harsh Realm, Millennium and The Lone Gunmen – and <b>our</b> <b>crew</b> is populated with all these faces that we'd worked with, over the past fifteen years. And there's even some people from the L.A. crew." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilford's right hand, {{the second}} in command on the train and has been the {{spokesperson}} for Wilford for the past 17 years. About the character, Swinton said, [...] "Mason is a pretty monstrous construct so we felt {{we were dealing with}} extremes, but the truth was that we didn't have to go that far. Look at Hitler with his dyed black hair and Gaddafi with handmade medals stuck on his jacket." [...] Swinton prepared for the role by studying clowning politicians throughout history, and Mason is, in Swinton's words, [...] "a complete smash cut of all the monstrous, maniacal, political clowns." [...] Swinton added that the character is a mix of Margaret Thatcher, Colonel Gaddafi, Adolf Hitler and Silvio Berlusconi. The Lancashire accent Swinton uses is based on someone from her early life who had the accent and to her, [...] "was an early example of authority". Tilda and Bong met at the Cannes Film Festival when We Need to Talk About Kevin played and both wanted to work together. In one original scenario, Mason was a middle-aged man and first mentioned as [...] "peaceful", so Bong changed it and offered it to Swinton. Bong added, [...] "I originally talked to John C. Reilly about playing Mason." [...] On Mason's appearance, Bong stated, [...] "Tilda actually wanted to take the look further and I had to pull her back. She at the time really wanted to transform herself and look different than she ever looked before. I was all for it. Obviously there was something that started the whole look." [...] Additionally Swinton stated, [...] "As we were playing we had these ideas, like fantastic pendulous breasts [...] And Jamie Bell loved wearing them of course. We have a picture of him. <b>Our</b> <b>crew</b> picture involves [...] wearing Mason's breasts." [...] Bong was inspired by a photo Ondrej Nekvasil found of a lady inside the National Museum of Natural History, and he showed the image to Tilda who [...] "loved it". The appearance of Mason was based on Roxie Collie Laybourne.|$|E

Ye've {{set their}} value at twenty {{thousand}} pieces, {{and for that}} sum you may have them, since you desire it; but you'll pay for them the twenty thousand pieces that are ultimately {{to come to you}} as the ransom of one and the dowry of the other; and that sum shall be divided among <b>our</b> <b>crews.</b> So that you do that, it is conceivable that our followers may take a lenient view of your breach of the articles we jointly signed." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "I’m really {{fortunate}} {{to be given the}} crew members that I have on this mission. It’s myself and six others. We do swap one of <b>our</b> <b>crew</b> members with the expedition crew member on board. So Greg goes up, Greg stays on station and Garrett comes home. But the crew that was assigned to me—I’m really {{fortunate to}} have some really talented people. Ken Ham, as a pilot, knows the orbiter better than anybody I’ve seen. This is his first flight. My lead EVA crew member is Mike Fossum who did three spacewalks on my previous flight, STS-121. We’ve flown together before. I have all the confidence in the world in his ability to execute these EVAs. Karen Nyberg, my MS1, sits on the flight deck for ascent and entry. She’s also the lead for all the robotic arm operations. She’ll be flying three robotic arms in space, incredibly motivated, well ahead of the game and I expect great things from her. Ron Garan is my flight engineer, a colonel in the Air Force. This is going to be his first time in space as well as is Karen’s and Ken’s and he’s doing three spacewalks. So he's got a lot on his plate. He’s been doing great during training and he’s going {{to have the opportunity to}} prove himself during these three spacewalks. I kind of wish it was me getting to go outside. I can’t do that, but we expect great things from Ron as well. And then I have Aki Hoshide, our Japanese crew member, who grew up in New Jersey kind of like me. That’s an interesting thing about our flight—we have four people from New Jersey on the mission. I look at Aki as the payload commander. He is responsible for that Japanese laboratory and he has taken on that responsibility as completely as I could have hoped for. All through our training he’s been very much focused on the Japanese lab, making sure it’s ready to go, making sure we’re completely trained on the systems and everything we have to do. I’ve given him a lot of responsibility and he’s completely taken it on." ...|$|E
60|$|That was all, but it {{verified}} my own judgment. While {{it might}} be true, as Miss West had said, that every ship's crew contained several lunatics and idiots, it was a foregone conclusion that <b>our</b> <b>crew</b> contained far more than several. In fact, and {{as it was to}} turn out, <b>our</b> <b>crew,</b> even in these degenerate sailing days, was an unusual crew in so far as its helplessness and worthlessness were beyond the average.|$|E

40|$|When we send {{humans to}} search for life on Mars, we'll {{need to know what}} we brought with us versus what may already be there. To ensure <b>our</b> <b>crewed</b> {{spacecraft}} meet planetary protection requirements [...] and to protect our science from human contamination [...] we'll need to know whether micro-organisms are leaking/venting from our ships and spacesuits. This is easily done by swabbing external vents and surfaces for analysis, but there was no US EVA tool for that job. NASA engineers developed an EVA-compatible swab tool {{that can be used to}} collect data on current hardware, which will influence eventual Mars life support and EVA hardware designs...|$|R

2500|$|A {{representative}} for the network said in a statement, [...] "We were disappointed when, without warning late yesterday, March 9, Verizon FiOS dropped The Weather Channel from their lineup while our companies continued to be in active conversations regarding a contract renewal. FiOS customers have enjoyed a bundle of services from The Weather Channel including the network, Weatherscan, On-Demand, a Weather Widget and streaming on mobile devices. During a winter with record-breaking storms and severe weather, The Weather Channel responded with non-stop live coverage, including the ongoing presence of <b>our</b> <b>crews</b> reporting live from hard-hit communities within the Verizon FiOS footprint. This coverage resulted in The Weather Channel being the only major cable network to grow in February." ...|$|R

5000|$|The Americans {{also had}} their own {{concerns}} about Soviet spacecraft. Christopher C.

Each Soyuz component, however, is designed for a specific function; if one fails, the cosmonauts land as soon as possible. The Apollo vehicle also relied on astronaut piloting to a much greater extent than did the Soyuz machine". American and Soviet engineers already settled their differences for a possible docking of American and Soviet spacecraft in meetings between June and December 1971 in Houston and Moscow, including Bill Creasy’s design of the Androgynous Peripheral Attach System between the two ships that would allow either to be active or passive during docking.|$|R
