500|$|Chris Carter of Destructoid called Birthrights story [...] "relatively {{open and}} shut" [...] despite keeping complex {{character}} relationships intact, while generally citing {{it as the}} best starting place for series newcomers. Javy Gwaltney of Game Informer called the story of Birthright [...] "a surprisingly dark tale", praised the improvements made to the gameplay over Awakening, and was overall positive despite some criticism of its poor tutorial systems. He also liked the game's music and graphics, although he critiqued the latter a little due to low-res battle models. Meghan Sullivan of IGN called the story, music and visuals [...] "great", and greatly enjoyed the gameplay systems despite mission repetition and a slow <b>online</b> <b>interface.</b> Alexa Ray Corriea of GameSpot greatly enjoyed the changes to gameplay and its strategy despite little variation in playable maps, and enjoyed the character interactions while noting that the dialogue became overly melodramatic in places. Kimberley Keller of Nintendo World Report, reviewing all versions of the game, generally praised the game as a whole while calling Birthright the [...] "perfect way to start [...] " [...] due to its traditional Fire Emblem elements. Griffin McElroy and Allegra Frank of Polygon, reviewing all versions of the game, were generally positive about the gameplay and the interplay between versions, while criticizing the overly complicated character class system. They referred to Birthright as a [...] "straightforward march for vengeance, where victory almost always entails defeating an entire platoon or its leader". Both Connor Sheridan of GamesRadar and Ray Carsillo of Electronic Gaming Monthly shared many points of praise with other reviewers about the general gameplay: Sheriden called Birthright a familiar experience {{when compared to the}} other titles, while Carsillo recommended it as a good starting point.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{the first}} game to {{natively}} support the new revamped Battle.net <b>online</b> <b>interface.</b> It is split into three installments: the base game with the subtitle Wings of Liberty, expansion pack , stand-alone expansion pack [...] and downloadable content mission packs [...] The new Battle.net was planned with a marketplace for StarCraft II which would allow players to download both free and paid maps, but this feature {{has not yet been}} implemented. Instead, regular and custom maps are available for everyone and sorted by a popularity system based on total playtime. The new interface includes a chat service which {{is similar to that of}} Instant Messengers which allows players to interact across different games. Initially not having been shipped with regular, channel-based chat rooms, this was later added in a patch after both community and gaming media noted the lack of the feature. The game also supports VoIP for players.|$|E
2500|$|Inside the {{airtight}} enclosure are proprietary neodymium {{drivers and}} two opposing passive bass radiators {{along with a}} newly designed omnidirectional microphone, which is capable of 360-degree sound input with improved echo-cancellation and full duplex communication. The speaker also has LiveAudio [...] "three-dimensional sound" [...] technology built-in and updates to the speaker's driver system are handled through Jawbone's <b>online</b> <b>interface.</b> Connectivity is via a Bluetooth connection, headphone jack, or audio line out. Big Jambox can also connect to multiple devices at once, and users can control volume and play sequences from their device {{in addition to the}} speaker. A 2,600mAh rechargeable battery will provide roughly 15 hours of wireless listening time and 500 hours on standby. The Big Jambox speakerphone is intended for more of a conference room setting and while the Jambox has a front-facing microphone, intended to be used facing a user, Big Jambox sports a top-mounted omni-directional microphone to pick up sound from all angles. Big Jambox is rated as class one speakerphone.|$|E

40|$|Due to the {{potential}} cost savings and a very high customer convenience, online banking is still gaining popularity as a delivery channel for banking companies. Altough banks look for innovative services to provide more distinction between them and their competitors, <b>online</b> banking <b>interfaces</b> rarely differ {{when it comes to}} enable the search for elapsed transactions. The aim of the present study is to examine to what extent Ajax enabled technologies, such as dynamic querying and autosuggest, can support the users of an <b>online</b> banking <b>interface</b> in searching their elapsed transactions. Dynamic querying was used to set date ranges and amount ranges, whereas autosuggest was used to support the user in searching for transaction texts. Regarding our data, we advice against the use of dynamic querying to set date ranges in <b>online</b> banking <b>interfaces.</b> In contrast, we found autosuggest to be instrumental in searching for elapsed transactions. However, more investigations need to be conducted in order to make these findings conclusive. Using Autosuggest and Dynamic Querying...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand placed on online systems by users, many organizations and companies are seeking to enhance their <b>online</b> <b>interfaces</b> to facilitate the search process on their hidden databases. Usually, users issue queries to a hidden database by using the search template provided by the system. In this thesis, a new approach based mainly on hidden database reduction preserving functional dependencies is developed for enhancing the <b>online</b> system <b>interface</b> through a small screen device. The developed approach is applied to online market systems like eBay. Offline hidden data analysis is used to discover attributes and their domains and different functional dependencies. In this thesis, a comparative study between several methods for mining functional dependencies shows the advantage of conceptual methods for data reduction. In addition, by using online consecutive reductions on search results, we adopted a method of displaying results in order of decreasing relevance. The validation of the proposed designed and developed methods prove their generality and suitability for system interfacing through continuous data reductions.
