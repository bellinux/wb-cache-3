After some troubles, Little was again worth $2 million by 1846 (equivalent to about $ million today). However, his fortunes were again reversed that year when he attempted but failed to corner the Norwich and Worcester Railroad and was obligated to pay out for thousands of inflated shares that he had himself bid up in price, losing about {{a million dollars in}} the process—a staggering sum at the time.|$|E

40|$|This {{is number}} {{four in a}} series of six NebGuides on {{agricultural}} options. It explains how to evaluate <b>options</b> vs futures <b>contracts.</b> <b>Options</b> and futures <b>contracts</b> are similar. Both represent actions that occur in the future. Futures markets are contracts to either accept or deliver the actual physical commodity, while an <b>option</b> <b>contract</b> is a contract on the underlying futures <b>contract.</b> <b>Options</b> <b>contracts</b> give the farmer the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying commodity. This underlying commodity is a futures contract. Due to these similarities and the fact that options are based on a futures contract, producers may question the value of using an <b>options</b> <b>contract.</b> To make a decision between using a futures <b>contract</b> or an <b>options</b> <b>contract,</b> producers need to evaluate both alternatives...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze the impact of an <b>option</b> <b>contract</b> for two {{companies}} that are both members of a supply chain: a retailer and a supplier. An <b>option</b> <b>contract</b> is one where the retailer orders a quantity of units and has a right to modify his order if necessary. This ordered quantity may be modified in any sense (it may be bigger or smaller than the initial order) without restrictions by buying an option premium in advance from the supplier. This document presents a model to calculate the performance of an <b>option</b> <b>contract</b> in terms of contract value for the two companies engaged. First, the case of multiple suppliers and one retailer, and then the particular case of one supplier and one retailer are considered.
