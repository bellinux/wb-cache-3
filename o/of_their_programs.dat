40|$|The {{efficacy}} of distance education programs {{has been in}} the minds of those who do not view distance learning as being as good as face-to-face (FTF) instruction. Questions abound regarding this type of delivery, however, this method is growing in popularity especially among individuals who are much older and those who would like to leverage technology. School districts and traditional universities are now embracing this method in one form or the other. Although there is increasing popularity, there is still one unexplored area of distance education. One such area is the relationship between students’ academic standing and their perception, specifically in the area of teacher education. The study revealed that pre-service teachers at the beginning stage <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>program</b> were significantly more satisfied, overall, with distance courses and programs, than those at the end <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>program.</b> Students near the beginning and middle <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>program</b> rated grading and timely return of assignments, a sense of accomplishment, and willingness to take additional distance courses, significantly higher than those who were at the end <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>program.</b> However, the opportunity to know others in the distance class, although rated low, was higher for students at the end <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>program.</b> The study revealed that those in education should plan programs that will address the idiosyncrasies at all levels, thereby resulting in satisfaction on the part of student teachers...|$|R
