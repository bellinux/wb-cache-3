40|$|A line <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{flexible}} financing tools for companies. Banks give companies lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> {{to strengthen their}} profitability and competitive ability. On the other hand, companies draw the lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> that will increase banks' credit risk. It {{is very difficult for}} banks to determine the lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> for an enterprise group. Based on principle <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> risk evaluation and structural model, this paper first defines bank's tolerable default risk and lines <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> and then analyzes integrated lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>of</b> parent and subsidiary companies. The results of this research indicate that the lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>of</b> single company is related to its asset value growth, and integrated lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>of</b> an enterprise group is also related to member's asset value growth and the associated relationships. Furthermore, this study shows that the integrated lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> <b>of</b> an enterprise group can be determined by the weighted sum of member's lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and the computational formula of weight. This study provides a quantitative analysis tool to ascertain the enterprise group's integrated lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and analyze how the associated relationships affect the integrated lines <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> Integrated lines <b>of</b> <b>credit,</b> default probability, enterprise group, ratio of shareholding, 37 A 50, 60 Fxx, 60 G 10...|$|R

5|$|A new {{contract}} was signed on 19 July 2011 with Odebrecht; R$400million {{of the total}} would be financed by BNDES and the remaining R$420million would come from tax credits granted by the City. A 2007 law stated the tax credits {{could be used by}} any company that established itself in the Eastern region of the city, providing a credit of R$0.60 per R$1.00 invested. A new law was passed by the city legislature to deal specifically with this stadium and reduce the incentives, linking the concession of the credits to hosting the World Cup opening match and limiting the total amount <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> to R$420million. The concession was justified by the expectation that the stadium will generate R$950 million in city taxes during the six years after its opening. R$530 million in excess of the tax credits were given. The financing contract with BNDES was signed on 29 November 2013, under their ProCopas Arenas World Cup program.

5|$|To {{improve his}} {{academic}} profile, Moore planned to attend American Christian School in Aston, Pennsylvania, {{but a new}} NCAA rule was instituted that limited the number of core classes able to be taken at a prep school. Lacking the required number <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> to receive an athletic scholarship, he enrolled at Temple as a non-scholarship student and sat out his freshman year as a redshirt. In his freshman debut the following year, he scored 11points against East Tennessee State. Moore followed that performance up with a double-double of 11points and 10rebounds versus the College of Charleston, and a season-high 13points in a loss to Clemson. As a freshman, Moore averaged 4.5points and 2.3rebounds per game in 13.2minutes of playing time. After his 13th game, he was suspended due to Temple eligibility rules and did not play {{in the remainder of}} the season.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the campaign mode, Perfect Dark Zero features a multiplayer where a maximum of 32 players may compete in numerous types of deathmatch and objective-based games via split-screen, system link, or Xbox Live. The multiplayer offers two main modes with their own customisable options: DeathMatch and DarkOps. DeathMatch is a standard gametype where players spawn in rooms, collect weapons that {{are available on the}} map itself, and continue to the actual map. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from Killcount or Team Killcount, where the goal is to kill as many opposing players as possible, to objective-based games such as Capture the Flag and Territorial Gains. DarkOps, on the other hand, is a slower-paced and team-only gametype where weapons must be purchased from a player's stock <b>of</b> <b>credits</b> and credits are earned by killing enemies and completing objectives. Scenarios in this mode include Eradication, where the last team with any members left alive wins; Infection, where players score points by either infecting others or surviving infection; Sabotage, where the team that causes the most damage to the other team's property wins; and Onslaught, where one team must defend a base while the other has to attack it.|$|E

40|$|The Letter <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> as {{a method}} of {{smoothing}} international payment is a conditional security and obligation to pay the customer bank (issuing bank) to seller (applicant). For this purpose, the letters <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> may be considered as the most usual method of payment of goods price in international trade. The classic form <b>of</b> letters <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is the commercial letters <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> whose financial obligation is rooted in the documents that demonstrates the making of transaction by the beneficiary and it is used as a mechanism of payment and financial security in international transaction of goods. Contrary to commercial letter <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> which is a payment document, standby letter <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> has been taken into account for protection of beneficiary in case of default of payment to perform obligation or payment. Standby letters <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> are equal to bank guarantee and issued as performance and obligation security and in the form <b>of</b> letter <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> This article with cmparison of commercial letter <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and standby letter <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is to review the similarities and differences of these two documents and the most important legal aspects of both are compared in order to answer this question that when and in which form each of these means are used in international trade by the parties...|$|R

50|$|A {{business}} line <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> is {{quite similar to}} personal lines <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b> The financial institution grants access to a specific amount of financing. However, no interest is incurred until the funds are tapped into. A {{business line}} <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> can be unsecured or secured (typically, by inventory, receivables or other collateral). Lines <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> are {{often referred to as}} revolving and can be tapped into repeatedly. For instance, if there is access to a $60,000 line <b>of</b> <b>credit</b> and $30,000 is taken out, access to the remaining $30,000, if necessary, remains. If all $30,000 is paid back, there is access to the entire $60,000 without having to reapply, one of the biggest benefits of a line <b>of</b> <b>credit.</b>|$|R
