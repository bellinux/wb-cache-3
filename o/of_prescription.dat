40|$|Background: To {{examine the}} impact of {{introducing}} an electronic prescription system with no copayments on the number <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions,</b> the size <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions,</b> and the number of visits and phone calls to primary physicians. Methods: Fixed regression models using monthly data on per capita prescriptions claims and consultations between 2009 and 2013 at the municipality level, before and after the introduction <b>of</b> the electronic <b>prescription</b> system. Results: The electronic prescription system with no copayment increased the number <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> by between 6. 0 and 8. 1 %. It decreased the average size <b>of</b> each <b>prescription,</b> but it did not decrease the number of consultations. Conclusion: The reduced direct and indirect costs <b>of</b> obtaining <b>prescriptions</b> after the introduction <b>of</b> the electronic <b>prescription</b> system changed the financial incentives facing the patients and physicians. This led to significant changes in the level and size <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> and illustrates the importance of financial incentives...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{is concern}} {{regarding}} the irrational production, <b>prescription</b> and use <b>of</b> drugs in India. This study aimed {{to describe the}} quality <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> by medical practitioners, including both the layout <b>of</b> the <b>prescription</b> and the type and number of drugs prescribed. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey <b>of</b> all <b>prescriptions</b> dispensed at a busy pharmacy {{in the state of}} Goa, India, was carried out over a consecutive seven-day period. Each prescription was rated {{on the basis of a}} priori and pilot-tested variable list. The prescriptions by private practitioners were compared with those from practitioners in the public healthcare system. RESULTS: Nine hundred and ninety prescriptions were collected. The majority (83. 9 &#x 0025;) were from private practitioners. The quality of the layout <b>of</b> the <b>prescriptions</b> was unsatisfactory: information to identify the practitioner was incomplete in more than a third <b>of</b> the <b>prescriptions</b> and information to identify the patient was incomplete in more than half. Clarity of written instructions on how to take the medicines was unsatisfactory in the majority <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions.</b> Polypharmacy was the norm, with more than half (52. 7 &#x 0025;) the prescriptions containing at least 3 medicines. Forty per cent <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> included a vitamin or tonic preparation and a quarter <b>of</b> the <b>prescriptions</b> included an antibiotic and an analgesic. Over 90 &#x 0025; <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> contained only branded medicines. Private practitioners prescribed significantly greater number of medicines and were more likely to prescribe vitamins and antibiotics, and branded medicines. DISCUSSION: This study confirms that the quality <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions,</b> both in terms of layout and the content of the drugs prescribed, is inadequate. There is a need to standardize the format <b>of</b> <b>prescriptions</b> in India so that all essential information is included. There is a need to strengthen an independent mechanism for continuing professional development of practitioners to ensure that patients are always given evidence-based, cost-effective treatments...|$|R

5|$|While {{prohibited}} drugs are generally {{viewed as being}} the most dangerous, the misuse <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> drugs are linked to more deaths in several countries. Cocaine and heroin combined caused fewer deaths than prescriptions drugs in the United Kingdom in 2013, and fewer deaths than prescription opiates alone in the United States in 2008. As of 2015 the drug most likely to cause fatal overdose in Australia was diazepam (Valium). While fatal overdoses are highly associated with drugs such as opiates, cocaine and alcohol, deaths from other drugs such as caffeine are extremely rare.|$|E
5|$|In November 1956, Presley {{made his}} film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958, {{he was drafted}} into {{military}} service. He resumed his recording career two years later, producing {{some of his most}} commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and their accompanying soundtrack albums, most of which were critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii. On August 16, 1977, he suffered a heart attack in his Graceland estate, and died as a result. His death came in the wake of many years <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> drug abuse.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Nolan reprised {{his duties}} as director, and brought his brother, Jonathan, to co-write {{the script for}} the second installment. The Dark Knight {{featured}} Christian Bale reprising his role as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent / Two-Face. Principal photography began in April 2007 in Chicago and concluded in November. Other locations included Pinewood Studios, Ministry of Sound in London and Hong Kong. On January 22, 2008, after he had completed filming The Dark Knight, Ledger died from a bad combination <b>of</b> <b>prescription</b> medication. Warner Bros. had created a viral marketing campaign for The Dark Knight, developing promotional websites and trailers highlighting screen shots of Ledger as the Joker, but after Ledger's death, the studio refocused its promotional campaign. The film depicts Gotham attempting to rebuild after Batman's actions have caused so much damage to its organised crime families, aided by the prosecution of charismatic District Attorney Harvey Dent, but {{the involvement of the}} anarchic Joker threatens everything, as his actions lead to the death of Rachel Dawes and Harvey being scarred and transformed into Two-Face. Although Batman is able to stop the Joker from forcing two ferries- one loaded with civilians and the other with prisoners- to destroy each other, he is forced to take the blame for the murders committed by Dent to ensure that the city retains its hope for the future.|$|E
