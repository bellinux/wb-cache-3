5|$|A {{year later}} he {{returned}} to Scotland and became the organist at Glasgow's Barony Church; however, as he had no School Leaving Certificate, he could not study at a university.

In 1928, he was accepted to study music at the University of Edinburgh, under his friend and mentor, the renowned musicologist Sir Donald Tovey. Chisholm graduated with a Bachelor of Music degree in 1931 and as Doctor of Music in 1934.

At Paterson Eastside High School, Doby was a multi-sport athlete; as well as playing baseball and basketball, he was a wide receiver in football and lettered in track. After winning a state football championship, the Eastside team was invited to play in Florida, but the promoters would not allow Doby, the only black player on the team, to participate. Consequently, the team voted to forgo the trip as a gesture <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Doby.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the newly}} formed BJP was {{technically}} distinct from the Jana Sangh, the bulk of its rank and file were identical to its predecessor, with Vajpayee being its first president. Historian Ramachandra Guha writes that the early 1980s were marked by a wave of violence between Hindus and Muslims. The BJP initially moderated the Hindu nationalist stance of its predecessor the Jana Sangh to gain a wider appeal, emphasising its links to the Janata Party and the ideology of Gandhian Socialism. This was unsuccessful, as it won only two Lok Sabha seats in the elections of 1984. The assassination of Indira Gandhi {{a few months earlier}} resulted in a wave <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> the Congress which won a record tally of 403 seats, contributing to the low number for the BJP.|$|E
5|$|As the 46th Congress {{convened in}} 1879, the Democratic caucus was reduced, {{but they still}} held a {{plurality}} of seats. The new House contained 152 Democrats, 139 Republicans, and 20 independents, {{most of whom were}} affiliated with the Greenback Party. Many of Randall's fellow Democrats differed with him over protectionism and his lack <b>of</b> <b>support</b> <b>for</b> Southern railroad subsidies, and considered choosing Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of Kentucky as their nominee for Speaker, instead. Several other Southerners' names were floated, too, as anti-Randall Democrats tried to coalesce around a single candidate; in the end, none could be found and the caucus chose Randall as their nominee with 107 votes out of 152. With some Democrats not yet present, however, the Democrats began to fear that the Republicans and Greenbackers would strike a deal to combine their votes to elect James A. Garfield of Ohio as Speaker. When the time for the vote came, however, Garfield refused to make any compromises with the third-party men, and Randall and the Democrats were able to organize the House once more.|$|E

40|$|Objective: to {{identify}} the factors associated with lack <b>of</b> anticipated <b>support</b> <b>for</b> care for community-dwelling older adults. Method: this study presents comparison and logistic regression analyses of data from 671 individuals who took part of the multicentric study entitled "Frailty in older Brazilians" - a quantitative, epidemiologic and transversal investigation carried out between 2008 and 2009. Results: the subjective evaluation <b>of</b> anticipated <b>support</b> <b>for</b> care for community-dwelling older adults was a good indicator of risk <b>for</b> lack <b>of</b> anticipated <b>support</b> <b>for</b> care in women, older adults who live alone and those with poor self-rated health. Conclusion: {{it is necessary to}} reflect upon the formal support system currently available for older people in Brazil, considering that those who most frequently presented lack <b>of</b> anticipated <b>support</b> <b>for</b> care are an increasing population. The study also highlights the importance of using subjective methods for the evaluation of the adequacy <b>of</b> older adults' <b>support</b> network...|$|R
