2500|$|Webb's {{reporting}} in [...] "Dark Alliance" [...] remains controversial. [...] Many writers discussing the series point to errors in it. [...] The {{claim that the}} drug ring of Meneses-Blandón-Ross sparked the [...] "crack explosion" [...] has been perhaps the most criticized part of the series. Nick Schou, a journalist who wrote a 2006 biography of Webb, has claimed {{that this was the}} most important error in the series. Writing on the Los Angeles Times <b>opinion</b> <b>page,</b> Schou said, [...] "Webb asserted, improbably, that the Blandón-Meneses-Ross drug ring opened 'the first pipeline between Colombia's cocaine cartels and the black neighborhoods of Los Angeles,' helping to 'spark a crack explosion in urban America.' The story offered no evidence to support such sweeping conclusions, a fatal error that would ultimately destroy Webb, if not his editors." ...|$|E

[...] asked Amnon Dankner of the Maariv newspaper. Ben-Dror Yemini, the editor of the <b>opinion</b> <b>page</b> of Maariv, called Levy one of the [...] "propagandists for the Hamas". Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, wrote [...] " [...] the current Israeli heroes , from whom the Palestinians garner support for their ways, [...] Gideon Levy...." [...] In 2008, Arutz Sheva reported that Levy's article about the Jerusalem bulldozer attack was translated into Arabic for a Hamas website. In 2006, Gideon Ezra, Israel's former deputy Minister of Internal Security, suggested that the General Security Services should monitor Levy as a borderline security risk.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Gibbons and {{his wife}} Dawn {{purchased}} [...] {{of land in the}} ranch country near Lamoille, Nevada, approximately 20 miles South of Elko, Nevada. The land belonged to former Nevada Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead. The Elko County Assessor said he felt pressure from the governor, governor's lawyer {{and a member of the}} Nevada Tax Commission to lower the tax liability. Under state law, such an agricultural tax break goes only to legitimate farm and ranch operations, and must generate at least $5,000 a year in income. If such a land is developed by million-dollar homes, property taxes would go up. [...] "To say I was put in an awkward position I think is an understatement", Joe Aguirre, a Republican, told The Associated Press in 2008. [...] The <b>opinion</b> <b>page</b> of the Las Vegas Review-Journal said on the allegations that the deal might constitute fraud. Aguirre later admitted that his previous statements were made up on the Las Vegas Sun saying that he wasn't pressured into Gibbons tax break by Gibbons himself. The land deal was called off after Gibbons finalized the divorce from his wife.|$|E

2500|$|Leader of the Bloc Québécois Gilles Duceppe {{declared}} that he considered the editorial an attempt at justification. [...] "It even suggests {{there might be some}} problems in Quebec because of the language laws. It's unacceptable and it's deplorable and it's shameful for a newspaper of that stature", he said. [...] "Try imagining the opposite — If I'd made such nonsensical, absurd remarks (about English Canada). Then all the editorial writers across Canada would get involved." [...] Premier of Quebec Jean Charest was said to be disappointed by the Globe and Mail response. He was also said to be offended by the little consideration the paper gave his open letter, that was published in the readers' <b>opinion</b> <b>page</b> (like the one from Prime Minister Harper). [...] "The (House of Commons) motion is totally ignored", said the Premier's press attaché. On September 23, 2006, the Canadian Press reported that Edward Greenspon, editor of The Globe and Mail, expressed regrets. In a Globe and Mail column, without making formal apologies, he wrote that the personal opinions of Wong should have been excised from the piece, not because they were unacceptable, but because they constituted a [...] "thesis", not a [...] "statement of fact". He wrote that [...] "they should have been put into a separate piece clearly marked opinion". He however believed the reaction to be clearly disproportionate. Despite Greenspon's insinuation that the piece was not [...] "clearly marked opinion", it had in fact been accompanied by a headshot of Wong, the traditional means of designating opinion pieces.|$|E
