40|$|Abstract. In {{previous}} works, {{the authors}} showed that using robot-assisted steerable electrode array insertions can {{significantly reduce the}} insertion forces compared to non-steerable electrode arrays. In addition to steering the electrode array, {{it is possible to}} change its <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> with respect to the scala tympani. This paper focuses on determining the relevance <b>of</b> changing the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> <b>of</b> the electrode array by comparing steerable electrode array inser-tions using a two Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) robot versus a four DoF robot. Optimal insertion path planning strategies are presented for both two and four DoF insertions. Simulation results and experiments show that the four DoF in-sertions can improve over two DoF insertions. Moreover, changing the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> can further reduce the insertion forces. The simulation results also provide the workspace requirements for designing a custom parallel robot for robot-assisted cochlear implant surgery. ...|$|R

For the present-day dipole field, this is a zenith <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> 90 degrees from the geomagnetic west. At this incident angle, the Størmer cutoff energy at the (geomagnetic) equator is about 10 GeV whereas the vertical Størmer cutoff is about 14 GeV.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{modeling}} of an induced hydraulic fracture and a natural fracture in a poroelastic medium and study their interaction. A finite element based numerical model is developed for this purpose. The model integrates a wellbore, an induced hydraulic fracture, a natural fracture and a reservoir in a fully coupled manner and simulates {{the interaction between}} induced hydraulic fracture and a natural fracture. A half reservoir model is used {{to take advantage of}} symmetry. In order to have control over the entire grid and element numbering, an innovative mesh generator was developed as part of this study. Fracture propagation is modeled based on KGD fracture mechanics. The numerical studies have shown that a natural fracture has a profound effect on the induced fracture propagation. It has been observed that in most cases the induced fracture crosses the natural fracture at high <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> and high differential stress. The width of the induced fracture decreases as it propagates. Once the induced fracture crosses a natural fracture and it propagates further into the formation fracture width increases. At low <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> and low differential stress the induced fracture {{is more likely to be}} arrested (at least short time) and/or breaks out from the far end side of the natural fracture. Results also showed that in the case <b>of</b> high <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> the hydraulic fracture always crosses the natural fracture and the differential stress has no significant effect on the propagation of hydraulic fracture. It has been also observed that propagation of induced fracture is stopped by a large (> 10 m) natural fracture at high <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach.</b> If the injection rate, however, is increased the induced fracture crosses the large natural fracture at high <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach.</b> At low <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> the induced fracture deviates and propagates along natural fracture. Crossing of natural fracture and/or arrest by the natural fracture is controlled by shear strength of the natural fracture, natural fracture orientation and in-situ stress state of the reservoir. From the results of this study it has been found that this model has a potential application in the design and optimization of hydraulic fracture treatments in naturally fractured reservoirs including tight gas reservoirs and enhanced geothermal systems. The model can also be used in the design of hydraulic stimulation of naturally fractured reservoirs based on shear dilation principle...|$|R

40|$|The {{variation}} of the throwing distance and Head Injury Criterion with car velocity, point <b>of</b> impact and <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> has been studied for bicycle impact with three different categories of vehicles-small cars, sports utility vehicles and buses. Crashes between a bicycle and the vehicles were simulated using multi body models developed in MADYMOTM with parametric variations in speed, <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> and point <b>of</b> impact. The variation in the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> or point <b>of</b> contact causes significant changes. From the simulations, the large spread in the data reported by reconstruction is predicted to originate from variation in the impact configuration. The changes in the trends {{can be associated with}} key changes {{in the nature of the}} impact visible in the simulations (head impacting car, no impact of rider with car etc.). The kinematics of impact has significant differences in case of the bus and this leads to differences in the nature of correlations. The HIC values were found to be higher in the case of bus as compared to the SUV and the small car. The paper reinforces the hypothesis that for bicycle accident reconstruction should take into account variations in the impact configuration in addition to the throw distance recorded. The paper also gives data which when populated further could form a basis of such reconstructions...|$|R

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that motorcyclists have a {{relatively}} higher chance of falling victim to car driver right-of-way violations than cars at junctions. Various studies have pointed out this is particularly the case due to the motorcyclist’s poorer sensory- and cognitive conspicuity. The <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> between the car driver and motorcyclist may interact differently with conspicuity related causes of crash. However, the <b>angle</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> has not been given sufficient attention in the available literature. There are no experimental studies in which opposite- and perpendicular <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> are combined and compared between car driver-to-car and car driver-to-motorcycle interaction. The main goal {{of the present study}} was to examine differences in visual search and intentions to give way by car drivers, when motorcycles and cars approached two prior selected, four-legged non-regulated junctions. Video clips of oncoming cars and high- and low-salient motorcyclists were presented to 93 car driver’s license holders. Response times and eye-gazes of participants were measured. The results confirmed that car drivers gave way to perpendicularly oncoming motorcyclists later than perpendicularly oncoming cars (measured after first-fixating target vehicle), at one of the two selected junctions. Furthermore, results showed a reversed pattern from what was expected in opposite approaches, in which car drivers gave way to motorcyclists significantly earlier than cars. Lastly, results confirmed that car drivers fixated perpendicularly oncoming high-salient motorcyclists earlier than low-salient motorcyclists, on one of the two selected junctions. We could however not confirm that high-salient motorcyclists were detected earlier in opposite approaches too...|$|R

40|$|This study investigates {{particularly}} how {{a modified}} steel safety fence of the Vecu Sec type operates in collisions. This construction {{was placed on}} the highway N 44 in the Dutch municipality of Wassenaar. The study consists of two phases. In the first phase a passenger car and a lorry are used in the mathematical simulations of the modified Vecu Sec. The <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> chosen for the passenger car are 24, 20, and 15 degrees. The <b>angles</b> <b>of</b> <b>approach</b> determined for the lorry simulations are 20 degrees and 15 degrees. An impact speed of 70 km/h was determined for both vehicles. The second phase of the study describes the results of the mathematical simulations. The VEDYAC (VEhicle DYnamics And Crash dynamics) (VEhicle DYnamics And Crash dynamics) computer program was used. The study shows reasonable results of the simulated crashes with the passenger car. However, the results of the collisions with the lorry show that the modified Vecu Sec construction is too low. The simplest way to improve the Wassenaar variant of the Vecu Sec construction is to fasten both ends...|$|R
