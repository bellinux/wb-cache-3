5|$|The late 1970s {{through to}} the '80s was a {{turbulent}} period for Chelsea. An ambitious redevelopment of Stamford Bridge threatened the financial stability of the club, star players were sold and the team were relegated. Further problems were caused by a notorious hooligan element among the support, which was to plague the club throughout the decade. In 1982, Chelsea were, at the nadir of their fortunes, acquired by Ken Bates for the nominal sum of £1, although by now the Stamford Bridge freehold had been sold to property developers, meaning the club faced losing their home. On the pitch, the team had fared little better, coming close to relegation to the Third Division for the first time, but in 1983 manager John Neal put together an impressive new team for minimal <b>outlay.</b> Chelsea won the Second Division title in 1983–84 and established themselves in the top division, before being relegated again in 1988. The club bounced back immediately by winning the Second Division championship in 1988–89.|$|E

Results indicate that the relationship between appropriations and <b>outlays</b> varies quite considerably (and surprisingly) across functions and that the differences matter quite a lot, at least in certain areas.

5|$|The local {{government}} bodies; Panchayat, Municipalities and Corporations have existed in Kerala since 1959, however, the major initiative to decentralise the governance {{was started in}} 1993, conforming to the constitutional amendments of central government in this direction. With the enactment of Kerala Panchayati Raj Act and Kerala Municipality Act in 1994, the state implemented reforms in local self-governance. The Kerala Panchayati Raj Act envisages a 3-tier system of {{local government}} with Gram panchayat, Block panchayat and District Panchayat forming a hierarchy. The acts ensure a clear demarcation of power among these institutions. However, the Kerala Municipality Act envisages a single-tier system for urban areas, with the institution of municipality designed to par with the Gram panchayat of the former system. Substantial administrative, legal and financial powers are delegated to these bodies to ensure efficient decentralisation. As per the present norms, the state government devolves about 40 per cent of the state plan <b>outlay</b> to the local government.|$|E

The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for £32.5million. Performances were not a huge improvement on the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an <b>outlay</b> of over £100million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo Touré, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez and Joleon Lescott. In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board – was replaced as manager by Roberto Mancini.

5|$|In the mid- to late-1940s, the Menominee tribe was {{considered}} {{by a government}} survey to identify tribes for termination, {{a process in which}} federal recognition of the tribe would be withdrawn and the tribe would no longer be dependent on the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) to support them. The Menominee were thought to be a tribe that could be terminated because they were one of the richest tribes in the nation. The federal government thought that termination would allow the tribal members to be assimilated into mainstream American culture, becoming hard-working, tax-paying, productive citizens. In 1954, Congress terminated the federally recognized status of the tribe with the Menominee Indian Termination Act. According to the terms of the Termination Act, the federally recognized status was to end in 1958. The tribe and the state of Wisconsin successfully lobbied for a delay in the implementation of termination until 1961. The tribe was opposed to termination for a number of reasons; their concerns included the loss of tribal culture, the loss of land due to tax liens, the possibility of bankruptcy and loss of the tribal timber industry, and the lack of tribal members who were trained to run a county government. The state of Wisconsin was concerned that with no industry for the tribe to tax, the state would be responsible for the large financial <b>outlay</b> that would be required to maintain governmental operations for the former reservation.|$|E

He endorsed the state's role as a supplier of goods produced by state-owned enterprises and supported the long-time policy of labour distribution.

40|$|Abstract. Traffic roads {{building}} {{is one of}} the most complex production processes in civil engineering. It is the most extensive one concerning the quantity of works executed and the most significant one concerning the scope of financial resources expended.

The paper points out the significance, specific quality and application of the management of quality in the processes of traffic road building. Considerable <b>outlays</b> for the repairing of a low-quality traffic road represents a further motive for introducing the management of quality into the processes of traffic roads building. Beside these direct <b>outlays,</b> there are also indirect <b>outlays</b> caused by the delay of the traffic road building. As the <b>outlays</b> for the repairing of a low-quality traffic road noticeably exceed the <b>outlays</b> for the introduction of the management of quality systems, their introducing into the processes of traffic roads building becomes a necessity for planners, designers, subcontractors and contractors...|$|R

Simultaneously the author has presented his own propositions concerning measures of <b>outlays</b> concentration which should be applied In economic studies of this phenomenon on the macroeconomic scale. He suggests that the following magiltudes should be employed when determining measures and indexes of the investment <b>outlays</b> concentration: - value of the generated national income, - value of the commodity production estimated in production prices, - gross value of fixed assets, - employment level, - number of inhabitants, - percentage share of the analyzed unit in particular magnitudes of the organizational unit of higher level, - mutual ratio between size of <b>outlays</b> designated for particular material investment tasks, - growth rate and dynamics of investment <b>outlays.</b> On tho basis of the above accepted magnitudes there are proposed: - six measures and indexes for researches on the investment <b>outlays</b> concentration on the macroeconimic scale at the level of sectors, and industrial branches; - four measures and indexes for researches conducted in spatial, and sectorial-spatial system; - two indexes for researches conducted in time cross-section; three indexes for researches on concentration of <b>outlays</b> in the material scope.
