40|$|Abstract: <b>Organochlorine</b> <b>insecticides</b> {{are among}} the most {{important}} organotoxins and make a large group of pesticides. Physicochemical properties of these toxins, especially their high lipophilicity, facilitate the absorption and storage of these toxins in human and animal bodies.

In this research the residues of seven important <b>organochlorine</b> <b>insecticides</b> in 35 milk samples marketed in the city of Ahwaz, Iran, have been identified and measured. First the lipid phase was separated from the aqueous phase, then extraction of the toxin residues from the lipid phase and subsequent purification of each was achieved through a column of activated Florusil. Detection and measurement of the toxins were achieved by using HPLC instrument with a UV-Visible detector.
