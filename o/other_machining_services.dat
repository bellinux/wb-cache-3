40|$|Technical {{servicing}} is {{an integral}} element in the operation system of tractors and <b>other</b> agricul­tural <b>machines.</b> <b>Servicing</b> processes include mainly operations performed {{within the framework of}} scheduled periodical technical inspections, which objective is to ensure operability of technical objects and maximum extension of their failure-free operation. The aim {{of this study was to}} collect data on the execution of technical servicing for agricultural tractors used on family farms and to determine their proper scheduling. Analyses were conducted using a questionnaire distributed among farmers from the Wielkopolskie province. This study showed that most farmers perform technical servicing of tractors on farms, thus ignoring the schedule for the execution of technical inspections specified in the vehicle manual...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} efforts of the StratusLab project to better understand its target communities, to gauge their experience with cloud technologies, to validate the defined use cases, and to extract relevant requirements from the communities. In parallel, the exercise was used as a dissemination tool to inform people about existing software packages, to increase the awareness of StratusLab, and to expand the our contacts within our target communities. The project created, distributed, and analyzed two surveys to achieve these goals. They validate the defined use cases and provide detailed requirements. One identified, critical issue relates to system administrators' reluctance to allow users to run their own virtual machines on the infrastructure. The project must define the criteria to trust such images and provide sufficient sand-boxing to avoid threats to <b>other</b> <b>machines</b> and <b>services...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} the {{dynamics}} of land transactions, machine investments, {{and the demand for}} <b>machine</b> <b>services</b> using farm panel data from China. Recently, China's agriculture has experienced a large expansion of machine rentals and <b>machine</b> <b>services</b> provided by specialized agents, which has contributed to mechanization of agricultural production. On the other hand, the empirical results show that an increase in non-agricultural wage rates leads to expansion of self-cultivated land size. A rise in the proportion of non-agricultural income or the migration rate also increases the size of self-cultivated land. Interestingly, however, relatively educated farm households decrease the size of self-cultivated land, which suggests that relatively less educated farmers tend to specialize in farming. The demand for <b>machine</b> <b>services</b> has also increased if agricultural wage and migration rate increased over time, especially among relatively large farms. The results on crop income also support complementarities between rented-in land and <b>machine</b> <b>services</b> (demanded), which implies that scale economies are arising in Chinese agriculture with mechanization and active land rental markets.
