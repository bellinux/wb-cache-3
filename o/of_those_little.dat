[...] The songs on the album are all written about persons who Paul considers to be American heroes including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Rosa Parks. The album is Paul's attempt to teach children about some of America's most famous heroes. [...] "I was {{a big fan of}} Schoolhouse Rock in the 70s. [...] There was always a really great charm about the music. [...] The main reason I can still remember the Preamble of the Constitution is because <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> songs", Paul said. [...] The illustrations in the accompanying lyrics booklet were all created by Paul.|$|E
500|$|The {{landscape}} in Eragon {{is based on}} the [...] "wild territory" [...] of Paolini's home state, Montana. He said in an interview: [...] "I go hiking a lot, and oftentimes when I'm in the forest or in the mountains, sitting down and seeing some <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> details makes the difference between having an okay description and having a unique description." [...] Paolini also said that Paradise Valley, Montana is [...] "one of the main sources" [...] of his inspiration for the {{landscape in}} the book (Eragon takes place in the fictional continent Alagaësia). Paolini [...] "roughed out" [...] the main history of the land before he wrote the book, but he did not draw a map of it until it became important to see where Eragon was traveling. He then started to get history and plot ideas from seeing the landscape depicted.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for MTV News at Dylan's Candy Bar, Minaj revealed that she had kept the collaboration a secret from everyone she knew because she was [...] "so surprised" [...] at being asked to work with Carey and {{did not believe that}} the collaboration would actually come to fruition. [...] "That one, I didn’t believe until I was physically in the studio that I was doing with something with Mariah," [...] Minaj said. [...] "She’s an icon, I’ve loved her since I was little, like ’Vision of Love,’ ’Someday.’ I was one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> girls in the mirror singing her songs with my mother.” A release date of February 23, 2010, for the album was slated, and then pushed back to March 9. It was then further pushed back to March 30. However, it was confirmed in March 2010 that production of Angels Advocate had halted and the project was shelved indefinitely. Island Def Jam stated that the singer was instead working on a new project and [...] "new surprises". Metro revealed that Carey was possibly recording a Christmas album.|$|E
500|$|Sevigny {{has long}} been {{considered}} a fashion icon and regularly appears on best dressed lists. Throughout her career, she has modelled for several high-profile designers, including Miu Miu, H, Louis Vuitton and Chloé. Prior to her career as an actress, she had achieved fame for her unique style. While her sense of style in the early 1990s only reflected small downtown scenes and trends, it still made a significant impression on high class fashion chains which began to emulate Sevigny's look. Her interest in fashion and clothing, {{as well as her}} career as a fashion model in her late teenage years and early twenties, have led to a career as a prominent and well-respected fashion designer. She has expressed interest in fashion design throughout the entirety of her career, even dating back to her childhood: [...] "Little House on the Prairie was my favorite show. I would only wear calico print dresses, and I actually slept in one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> nightcaps!", she told People in 2007. Her unorthodox style (which garnered her initial notoriety in the early '90s) has often been referred to as very eclectic. Sevigny has since released several clothing lines designed by herself, both solo and in collaboration, and has earned a title as a modern fashion icon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mixing process}} proved difficult, lasting two weeks. Several {{changes were made}} during this period; Bono added a guitar part that played the song's chord {{progression}} to double the bass, an addition that [...] "solidified everything", according to the Edge. The Edge also changed the bass line in the chorus and converted a keyboard idea of Bono's into a guitar part that added a [...] "sour quality" [...] to balance the track's positivity. Lanois described the completed song as [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>those</b> <b>little</b> gifts where you think, my god, we've got it!" ...|$|E
