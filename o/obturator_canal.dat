Restorative Dentistry – Endodontics The technique of root canal preparation has evolved from the step-back technique to the balanced force technique.

The main feature is the preparation of the root canal with coronal flaring produced by greater taper instruments and the avoidance of procedural accidents by the more flexible nickel titanium.

Methodology: Sixty adult subjects with an untreated maxillary central incisor presenting a chronic periapical lesion smaller than 5  mm in diameter were recruited for the present study. The patients were randomly divided into two treatment groups: G 1 (n =  30), Revo-S/One Step Obturator; G 2 (n =  30) GTX/GTX <b>Obturator.</b> All root <b>canal</b> treatments were performed in a single session by the same operator. Sensitivity to palpation and percussion was registered at baseline and at the six-month recall. Radiographic healing was scored by two blind examiners according to a previously described scale. The absence of statistically significant differences in terms of baseline clinical parameters {{between the two groups}} was assessed by means of a Mann–Whitney test (age, apical gauging) and χ 2 test (sensitivity to percussion and palpation). The radiographic scores attributed to the two groups were compared with a Mann–Whitney test, while a χ 2 test served to compare the clinical data gathered after six months (p <  0. 05). Results: Baseline clinical parameters registered in the two groups were found to be comparable. All patients attended the six-month recall and all the teeth were referred to be negative to sensitivity, with the exemption of two subjects per group.

Using midline scroto-perineal approach, after bladder plate mobilization and radical corporal detachment; the pelvic surface of superior pubic ramus (SPR) was exposed. Above the <b>obturator</b> <b>canal,</b> H-shaped incision was made on periosteum of the SPR.

Forks of bone holding forceps hooked the pubic bone and tightened for its midline approximation, lengthening of the SPR and inward rotation of IP ramus. Linea alba and pubic bones were approximated with interrupted Polygalactin sutures. Results: Midline approximation of pubic bone and linea alba was possible in all.

40|$|Introduction: Obturator hernia {{is a rare}} {{condition}} {{accounting for}} less than 1 % of all intra abdominal hernias. Clinical diagnosis is considered a challenge for most surgeons. It usually appears as an intestinal obstruction. Confirmation of diagnosis is carried out by means of imaging or during surgery. Case report: An 85 -year-old female patient, with symptoms of intestinal obstruction of 24  h duration {{was admitted to the}} emergency room of Unimed Hospital – Belo Horizonte. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a herniation of the small bowel through the right <b>obturator</b> <b>canal</b> with an intestinal distension proximally.

It is also of especial use while dealing with surgical complications during surgeries with limited surgical field, where the way of approach limits the management of complications.

These patients had been referred to our chronic pelvic pain clinic. Outcomes of their surgery from February through November 2001 were analyzed. Median length of follow-up was 11 months (range, 6 to 16). A new technique using Cooper’s ligament and arcus tendineus fasciae pelvis {{was used for the}} tension-free mesh hernia repair.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONAn {{obturator}} hernia {{is a rare}} condition but {{is associated}} with the highest mortality of all abdominal wall hernias. Early surgical intervention is often hindered by clinical and radiological diagnostic difficulty. The following case report highlights these diagnostic difficulties, and reviews the current literature on management of such cases. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe present the case of an 86 -year-old lady who presented with intermittent small bowel obstruction, clear hernial orifices, and right medial thigh pain. Pre-operative CT imaging was suggestive of an obstructed right femoral hernia. However, intra-operatively the femoral canal was clear and an obstructed hernia was found passing through the obturator foramen lying between the pectineus and obturator muscles in the <b>obturator</b> <b>canal.</b> DISCUSSIONObturator hernias are notorious for diagnostic difficulty. Patients often present with intermittent bowel obstruction symptoms due to a high proportion exhibiting Richter's herniation of the bowel. Hernial sacs can irritate the obturator nerve within the canal, manifesting as medial thigh pain, and often no hernial masses can be detected on clinical examination. Increasing speed of diagnosis through early CT imaging has been shown to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with obturator hernias. However, over-reliance on CT findings should be cautioned, as imaging and operative findings may not always correlate. CONCLUSIONA high suspicion for obturator hernia should be maintained when assessing a patient presenting with bowel obstruction particularly where intermittent symptoms or medial thigh pain are present. Rapid clinical and appropriate radiological assessment, followed by early surgery is critical to successful treatment...|$|E
40|$|Tension-free suburethral tapes have {{revolutionized}} the surgical treatment of female {{stress urinary incontinence}} (SUI). These tapes are inserted {{by way of a}} retropubic or transobturator route. The inside-out tension-free vaginal tape transobturator approach, or TVT-Obturator system (TVT-O®, Ethicon Women's Health and Urology, Somerville, NJ), was developed ten years ago with the aim of minimizing the risk of urinary tract injuries associated with retropubic and outside-in transobturator tapes while reproducibly ensuring minimal tissue dissection. Cadaveric {{studies have shown that the}} anatomical trajectory of the TVT-O tape is strictly perineal and courses away from neighboring obturator and pudendal neurovascular structures. Several meta-analyses have shown similar SUI cure rates after retropubic and transobturator tape procedures. Yet, the transobturator route may be associated with less voiding dysfunction, blood loss, bladder perforation, and shorter operating time. The original TVT-O procedure was modified with the aim of reducing the incidence of postoperative groin pain as well as the rather theoretical risk of obturator nerve injury. This modified procedure, named TVT-ABBREVO® (Ethicon Women's Health and Urology, Somerville, NJ), utilizes a shortened, 12 -cm-long polypropylene tape. In addition, perforation of the obturator membrane with the scissors and guide is avoided in order to reduce the depth of lateral dissection, and consequently, to maximize securing of the tape within the obturator muscular/aponeurotic structures. In a comparative anatomical study, it was indeed observed that the shorter tape traversed less muscular structures (with no or only a minimal amount of tape lying in the adductor muscles) than its original counterpart, while still consistently anchoring in the obturator membrane at a similarly safe distance from the <b>obturator</b> <b>canal.</b> In a single-center randomized clinical trial, after a 3 -year minimum follow-up, the modified TVT-O procedure with a shorter tape and reduced dissection was found to be as safe and efficient as the primal procedure for treating female SUI, with less severe and frequent groin pain in the immediate postoperative period.
