5|$|His {{observations}} on the part played by organisms {{in the formation of}} the various features of reefs anticipated modern studies. To establish the thickness <b>of</b> <b>coral</b> barrier reefs, he relied on the old nautical rule of thumb to project the slope of the land to that below sea level, and then applied his idea that the coral reef would slope much more steeply than the underlying land. He was fortunate to guess that the maximum depth <b>of</b> <b>coral</b> would be around 5,000ft (1,500m), as the first test bores conducted by the United States Atomic Energy Commission on Enewetak Atoll in 1952 drilled down through 4610ft (1,405m) <b>of</b> <b>coral</b> before reaching the volcanic foundations. In Darwin's time no comparable thickness of fossil coral had been found on the continents, and when this was raised as a criticism of his theory neither he nor Lyell could find a satisfactory explanation. It is now thought that fossil reefs are usually broken up by tectonic movements, but at least two continental fossil reef complexes have been discovered to be about 3,000ft (1,000m) thick. While these findings have confirmed his argument that the islands were subsiding, his other attempts to show evidence of subsidence have been superseded by the discovery that glacial effects can cause changes in sea level.|$|E
5|$|Many governments now {{prohibit}} removal <b>of</b> <b>coral</b> from reefs, {{and inform}} coastal residents about reef protection and ecology. While local action such as habitat restoration and herbivore protection can reduce local damage, the longer-term threats of acidification, temperature change and sea-level rise remain a challenge.|$|E

5|$|The Structure and Distribution <b>of</b> <b>Coral</b> Reefs was {{published}} in May 1842, priced at 15 shillings, and was well received.

5|$|The Structure and Distribution <b>of</b> <b>Coral</b> Reefs, Being {{the first}} part of the geology of the voyage of the Beagle, under the command of Capt. Fitzroy, R.N. during the years 1832 to 1836, was {{published}} in 1842 as Charles Darwin's first monograph, and set out his theory of the formation <b>of</b> <b>coral</b> reefs and atolls. He conceived of the idea during the voyage of the Beagle while still in South America, before he had seen a coral island, and wrote it out as HMS Beagle crossed the Pacific Ocean, completing his draft by November 1835. At the time there was great scientific interest in the way that coral reefs formed, and Captain Robert FitzRoy's orders from the Admiralty included the investigation of an atoll as an important scientific aim of the voyage. FitzRoy chose to survey the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean. The results supported Darwin's theory that the various types <b>of</b> <b>coral</b> reefs and atolls could be explained by uplift and subsidence of vast areas of the Earth's crust under the oceans.|$|E
5|$|Water {{temperature}} {{changes of}} more than 1–2°C (1.8–3.6°F) or salinity changes can kill some species <b>of</b> <b>coral.</b> Under such environmental stresses, corals expel their Symbiodinium; without them coral tissues reveal the white of their skeletons, an event known as coral bleaching.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to the advantage described above, the coral primary polyp system has certain further advantages for evaluating the calcification responses <b>of</b> <b>corals,</b> as compared with experiments using the adult branches <b>of</b> <b>corals.</b> Primary polyps are very small and the calcification of primary polyps is visibly fast; therefore, {{a sufficient number of}} specimens is easily available. As such, the application of live tissue imaging to the coral primary polyp system would facilitate our understanding of the calcification responses <b>of</b> <b>corals</b> to various environmental factors (Ohno et al. 2017 a, b).|$|R

5|$|Darwin's first {{literary}} {{project was}} his Journal and Remarks {{on the natural}} history of the expedition, now known as The Voyage of the Beagle.

At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E

5|$|The {{most popular}} kind <b>of</b> <b>coral</b> kept is soft coral, {{especially}} zoanthids and mushroom corals, which are especially {{easy to grow}} and propagate {{in a wide variety}} of conditions, because they originate in enclosed parts of reefs where water conditions vary and lighting may be less reliable and direct. More serious fishkeepers may keep small polyp stony coral, which is from open, brightly lit reef conditions and therefore much more demanding, while large polyp stony coral is a sort of compromise between the two.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} {{rocks on}} the slopes of seamounts are heavily populated by suspension feeders, particularly corals, which capitalize on the strong currents around the seamount to supply them with food. This is in sharp contrast with the typical deep-sea habitat, where deposit-feeding animals rely on food they get off the ground. In tropical zones extensive coral growth results in the formation <b>of</b> <b>coral</b> atolls late in the seamount's life.|$|E

40|$|Percent {{reflectance}} <b>of</b> <b>corals</b> {{is perhaps}} the most important remotely sensed data that can be related to their biophysical properties. Because most of the biophysical variables <b>of</b> <b>corals</b> (i. e., pigment content, live cover and algal overgrowth) are related to their reflectance spectra, the analysis and inversion of the spectra may provide an account of these variables. Our research was aimed at determining the relationship between the percent live cover and reflectance <b>of</b> <b>corals.</b> Two wavelength bands (405 – 425 nm, and 590 – 600 nm) were identified to establish the relationship. A linear relationship was observed, which showed higher correlation (R 2 = 0. 886) at 405 – 425 nm when compared to 590 – 600 nm (R 2 = 0. 602). Validation methods revealed that 405 – 425 nm wavelength range provided a better relationship than 590 – 600 nm in predicting percent live cover <b>of</b> <b>corals...</b>|$|R

40|$|Inhibition {{of early}} life stages <b>of</b> <b>corals</b> by benthic algae is a {{critical}} bottleneck to the recovery and resilience <b>of</b> <b>corals.</b> Increasingly frequent and severe disturbances are causing large-scale coral mortality, usually followed by colonisation and dominance by benthic algae. The capacity <b>of</b> <b>corals</b> to re-establish in such algal-dominated habitats {{will depend on the}} effects of the algae on growth and survivorship <b>of</b> juvenile <b>corals.</b> We experimentally evaluated the competition between juvenile corals Porites astreoides and algae and the effects of algae on the exposure <b>of</b> juvenile <b>corals</b> to damage by parrotfishes (family Scaridae) in a Colombian Caribbean reef. We also explored whether those effects were consistent among climatic seasons (upwelling and non-upwelling). Benthic algae had negative and positive effects on the juvenile <b>corals.</b> The removal <b>of</b> algal turfs and fleshy macroalgae enhanced coral growth. Unexpectedly, removal of algae from around the juvenile corals increased predation upon the corals by parrotfishes. When algae were removed, at least 50 % <b>of</b> the <b>corals</b> were grazed by parrotfishes, but no bites were observed on corals with intact algae. Coral growth and parrotfish damage were not affected by season. However, damage by parrotfishes neither lessened survivorship nor resulted in negative growth for any <b>of</b> the grazed <b>coral</b> colonies. The beneficial effects of algae in protecting the juvenile corals from parrotfish damage seem to be outweighed by the negative effects of the algae on coral-algal competition. Understanding such complexities in the interactions between algae and early life stages <b>of</b> <b>corals</b> can provide insight into the roles <b>of</b> algae in <b>coral</b> reef resilience.
