The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments measure {{the intensity of}} visible and near-infrared light reflecting off <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>leaves.</b> Scientists use the information to calculate the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), an indicator of photosynthetic activity or “greenness” of the landscape.|$|E
25|$|During the {{development}} <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>leaves,</b> the specialized guard cells differentiate from “guard mother cells”. The {{density of the}} stomatal pores in leaves is regulated by environmental signals, including increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, which reduces the density of stomatal pores in the surface of leaves in many plant species by presently unknown mechanisms. The genetics of stomatal development can be directly studied by imaging of the leaf epidermis using a microscope. Several major control proteins that function in a pathway mediating {{the development}} of guard cells and the stomatal pores have been identified.|$|E
25|$|P. exigua {{are found}} from Bolivia to {{southern}} Brazil, with particular sightings in Venezuela, Guatemala, and Colombia. The wasps can inhabit orange orchards and eucalyptus plantations. They settle in green areas surrounded by small-sized trees and bushes. Unlike the mud nests of Polybia emaciata and Parachartergus colobopterus that are strongly attached to stable foundations, P. exigua nests are more frequently destroyed. Their nests generally {{hang from the}} underside <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>leaves</b> and tree branches. The nests rarely exist for more than 6 months since they are attached to leaves that eventually fall; in addition, the nests are constantly vulnerable to parasitoid infestations. Parasitoid nest destruction can uncouple the wasps’ colony cycle from their nesting cycle and ultimately disunite the colony.|$|E

25|$|How the {{infinite}} variety <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>leaves</b> is generated {{is a subject}} of intense research. Some common themes have emerged. One {{of the most significant}} is the involvement of KNOX genes in generating compound leaves, as in tomato (see above). But this again is not universal. For example, pea uses a different mechanism for doing the same thing. Mutations in genes affecting leaf curvature can also change leaf form, by changing the leaf from flat, to a crinky shape, like the shape of cabbage leaves. There also exist different morphogen gradients in a developing leaf which define the leaf's axis. Changes in these morphogen gradients may also affect the leaf form. Another very important class of regulators of leaf development are the microRNAs, whose role in this process has just begun to be documented. The coming years should see a rapid development in comparative studies on leaf development, with many EST sequences involved in the process coming online.|$|E

50|$|Leaf {{heliotropism}} is {{the solar}} tracking behavior <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>leaves.</b> Some plant species have leaves that orient themselves perpendicularly to the sun's rays {{in the morning}} (diaheliotropism), and others have those that orient themselves parallel to these rays at midday (paraheliotropism).

50|$|Malate is also {{synthesized}} by the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate in {{the guard}} cells <b>of</b> <b>plant</b> <b>leaves.</b> Malate, as a double anion, often accompanies potassium cations during the uptake of solutes into the guard cells {{in order to}} maintain electrical balance in the cell. The accumulation of these solutes within the guard cell decreases the solute potential, allowing water to enter the cell and promote aperture of the stomata.|$|E

30|$|The <b>leaves</b> <b>of</b> a <b>plant</b> are {{the main}} {{apparatus}} for photosynthesis and respiration, and closely link with the surrounding environment.
