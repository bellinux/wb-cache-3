5|$|Narayan's writing {{style was}} often {{compared}} to that of William Faulkner since both their works brought out the humour and energy of ordinary life while displaying compassionate humanism. The similarities also extended to their juxtaposing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of society against the confusions of individuality. Although their approach to subjects was similar, their methods were different; Faulkner was rhetorical and illustrated his points with immense prose while Narayan was very simple and realistic, capturing the elements all the same.|$|E
40|$|Studies <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> {{relations}} on <b>the</b> consumer markets bring much useful information. <b>The</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>the</b> elasticity coefficients {{is frequently}} used for <b>the</b> quantitative analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> sensitivity. Formulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investigated <b>demand</b> functions {{is very important}} for <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> elasticity. Within net consumer demand (consumer purchase), it is possible to differentiate the physical and expenditure forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> functions. <b>The</b> paper is focused on the theoretical and methodological backgrounds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> price-demand elasticity under the physical and expenditure definitions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> relationships. In this paper, the relationship between <b>the</b> coefficient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> price elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> in <b>the</b> physical form and <b>the</b> coefficient <b>of</b> <b>the</b> price elasticity <b>of</b> <b>demand</b> in <b>the</b> expenditure form is determined and studied.

Shirley ordered a number of armed men who were protecting his house to fire at the mob, but William Pepperrell was able to stop Shirley's men from firing and to persuade the mob to leave. In the meantime, Commodore Knowles threatened to bombard Boston with his squadron. It was only after the Massachusetts Council adopted resolutions in support <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of the mob that the situation became quieter in Boston. The mob eventually released its hostages and Knowles released the impressed seamen.|$|E
5|$|After the {{creation}} of the provisional government in Thessaloniki, negotiations between the Allies and king intensified. The Allies wanted further demobilization of the Greek army and the removal of military forces from Thessaly to insure the safety of their troops in Macedonia. The king wanted assurances that the Allies would not officially recognize or support Venizelos' provisional government and guarantees that Greece's integrity and neutrality would be respected. After several unproductive negotiations, on 23 October the king suddenly agreed to some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> required by the Allies including the removal of the Greek army from Thessaly. The king also volunteered war materiel and the Greek navy to assist them. In exchange, the king requested French Deputy Paul Bénazet to keep this agreement secret from the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Andrée's heroic motives {{have been}} questioned, {{beginning}} with Per Olof Sundman's bestselling semi-documentary novel of 1967, The Flight of the Eagle. Sundman portrays Andrée as the victim <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> {{of the media}} and the Swedish scientific and political establishment, and as ultimately motivated by fear rather than courage. Sundman's interpretation of the personalities involved, the blind spots of the Swedish national culture, {{and the role of the}} press is reflected in the film adaptation, Flight of the Eagle (1982), based on his novel and directed by Jan Troell. It was nominated for an Oscar.|$|E

5|$|One of the Prussian playing-for-time {{requests}} to the Patriotic Party was {{that before the}} treaty is signed, {{they need to see}} more reforms within the Commonwealth government. In October 1789, the changing international situation (primarily the military defeats of the Ottoman Empire) suddenly and temporarily increased the value of an alliance with Poland for Prussia. In the meantime, the previously anti-royalist Patriotic Party has begun drifting closer to the king. In February and March 1790, concrete proposals were exchanged between Warsaw and Berlin. Some difficulties were centered around Prussian demands for the cession of Gdańsk and Toruń, and tariffs, but a threat of a Polish-Austrian alliance, recently brought forward by Austria, caused Prussia to withdraw most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> the Polish side was finding difficult to accept.|$|E
5|$|The {{reconstruction}} of Castell Coch was delayed until 1875, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of work at Cardiff Castle and an unfounded concern by the Marquess's trustees {{that he was}} facing bankruptcy. On commencement, the Kitchen Tower, Hall Block and shell wall were rebuilt first, followed by the Well Tower and the Gatehouse, and the Keep Tower last. Burges's drawings for the proposed rebuilding survive at the Bute seat of Mount Stuart. The drawings were supplemented by {{a large number of}} wooden and plaster models, from smaller pieces to full-size models of furniture.|$|E
5|$|Music {{from the}} opera became {{the subject of}} {{numerous}} virtuoso works of the time. The brilliant transcription of its themes (Reminiscences de Robert le diable) made by the composer and virtuoso Franz Liszt was so popular that it became his calling card: {{on more than one occasion}} he was forced to interrupt his programmed concerts to play it because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of the audience. On the day of its publication by Maurice Schlesinger, the edition of 500 was completely sold out and it had to be immediately reprinted. Indeed, the success of Robert, whose score was also published by Schlesinger, was said to have saved him from bankruptcy. Frédéric Chopin and Auguste Franchomme jointly composed a Grand duo concertant on themes from the opera, for cello and piano, in 1832, and the Italian pianist and composer Adolfo Fumagalli composed an elaborate fantasy on the opera for left hand alone as his Op. 106.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a repeated newsvendor setting where <b>the</b> parameters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demand</b> distribution are unknown, and we study <b>the</b> problem <b>of</b> setting inventory targets using {{only a limited}} amount of historical demand data.

25|$|The first {{company to}} {{introduce}} an eight-hour working day in Japan was the Kawasaki Dockyards in Kobe (now the Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation). An eight-hour day was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> {{presented by the}} workers during pay negotiations in September 1919. After the company resisted the demands, a slowdown campaign was commenced by the workers on 18 September. After ten days of industrial action, company president Kōjirō Matsukata agreed to the eight-hour day and wage increases on 27 September, which became effective from October. The effects of the action were felt nationwide and inspired further industrial action at the Kawasaki and Mitsubishi shipyards in 1921.|$|E
25|$|Threatened by {{a humiliating}} {{ultimatum}} from Napoleon, the Portuguese government acceded to most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> of the French emperor. Nevertheless, Napoleon ordered Junot to commence the invasion, {{with the cooperation}} of three divisions from the Kingdom of Spain. Paralyzed by fear and indecision, the Portuguese authorities offered no resistance. Junot occupied Lisbon on 30 November 1807 to find that John and many of the leading families had left for Brazil aboard the Portuguese fleet. The French quickly occupied the entire country and appropriated or disbanded the Portuguese army. The following year saw the Portuguese revolt against their occupiers. The next action was the Battle of Évora in July 1808.|$|E
25|$|In January 1866, Russian ships {{appeared}} {{on the east coast}} of Korea demanding trading and residency rights in what seemed an echo <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>demands</b> made on China by other western powers. Korean Christians with connections at court saw in this an opportunity to advance their cause and suggested an alliance between France and Korea to repel the Russian advances, suggesting further that this alliance could be negotiated through Bishop Berneux. The Heungseon Daewongun seemed open to this idea, but it was possibly a ruse to bring the head of the Korean Catholic Church out into the open; upon Berneux's arrival to the capital in February 1866, he was seized and executed. A round-up then began of the other French Catholic priests and Korean converts.|$|E
