40|$|Six 2, 4 -diaminopteridines {{substituted}} in the 6 and 7 {{positions were}} tested as potentiators of sulphadimidine against Eimeria tenella. 2, 4 -Diamino- 6, 7 -di-isopropylpteridine and 2, 4 -diamino- 1 '-propylindolo(2 ', 3 ': 6, 7) pteridine {{were selected for}} further study. Both potentiated sulphadimidine against E. tenella and the di-isopropylpteridine potentiated it against E. necatrix. A 10 % mixture of the di-isopropylpteridine with sulphadimidine (or <b>other</b> <b>sulphonamides)</b> appears to offer advantages {{in the treatment of}} E. tenella and still more of E. necatrix...|$|E
40|$|Two {{electrically}} neutral analytes previously observed {{to be separated}} from the neutral marker in capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) experiments [sulphanilamide (SAA) and sulphaguanidine (SGW) ] have been examined to determine the basis for separation. The degree of separation increases markedly with buffer concentration and improves with increasing field strength. On the basis of the apparent electrophoretic mobilities in conventional CZE, migration times in a zero EOF environment were calculated for SAA, SGW and six <b>other</b> <b>sulphonamides</b> that were known to be ionized. These six markers were used to test the legitimacy of our predictions and to correct for small discrepancies between the predicted and observed migration times. It was concluded that SAA and SGW have negligible electrophoretic mobilities and that they are retained in the electrical double layer close to the capillary wall. A mechanism for adsorption is proposed and the generality of the phenomenon is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} indicates that CYP 2 C 9 ranks amongst the most important drug metabolizing enzymes in humans. Substrates for CYP 2 C 9 include fluoxetine, losartan, phenytoin, tolbutamide, torsemide, S-warfarin, and numerous NSAIDs. CYP 2 C 9 activity in vivo is inducible by rifampicin. Evidence suggests that CYP 2 C 9 substrates may also be induced variably by carbamazepine, ethanol and phenobarbitone. Apart from the mutual competitive inhibition which may occur between alternate substrates, numerous other drugs {{have been shown to}} inhibit CYP 2 C 9 activity in vivo and/or in vitro. Clinically significant inhibition may occur with coadministration of amiodarone, fluconazole, phenylbutazone, sulphinpyrazone, sulphaphenazole and certain <b>other</b> <b>sulphonamides.</b> Polymorphisms in the coding region of the CYP 2 C 9 gene produce variants at amino acid residues 144 (Arg 144 Cys) and 359 (Ile 359 Leu) of the CYP 2 C 9 protein. Individuals homozygous for Leu 359 have markedly diminished metabolic capacities for most CYP 2 C 9 substrates, although the frequency of this allele is relatively low. Consistent with the modulation of enzyme activity by genetic and other factors, wide interindividual variability occurs in the elimination and/or dosage requirements of prototypic CYP 2 C 9 substrates. Individualisation of dose is essential for those CYP 2 C 9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index...|$|E

40|$|The {{liquid-liquid}} extraction of {{a mixture of}} sulphonamides was achieved to examine {{the correlation between the}} experimental errors in the recoveries. Also, the impact of the composition of the extraction liquid was investigated. Six sulphonamides were repeatedly extracted simultaneously with ten different extraction liquids and determined with a reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) system. The means, standard deviations and covariances (or correlations) of the recoveries were calculated. These data showed that correlation between the extraction of two or more structurally related compounds depends strongly on the extraction liquid composition used: the selection of an appropriate extraction liquid is very important for the development of accurate and reproducible assay methods. Selection of improper extraction liquids may introduce errors in internal standard calibration that are larger than the errors in external standard calibration. The selection of a suitable internal standard is also very important for the development of accurate and reproducible assay methods. Even compounds that are structurally related to the analyte may demonstrate completely different extraction behaviour. Selection of a proper internal standard and an accurate extraction liquid increases the accuracy and precision of the method. To investigate the influence on routine analysis, the data were used to simulate 50 analytical runs (calibration graphs with quality control samples) for each sulphonamide separately with external and internal standard calibration. In the latter option the <b>other</b> five <b>sulphonamides</b> were all tested as internal standards. This was done for all extraction liquids used. The results of these simulations demonstrate great differences between different extraction liquid compositions and internal standards for a given analyte. Also the calibration method (internal or external calibration) was found to be very important. Circumstances have been observed where external standard calibration gives better analysis results than internal standard calibration. The method described here can be applied for the selection of a suitable internal standard and extraction liquid for sample preparation by {{liquid-liquid extraction}} prior to HPLC...|$|R
40|$|Four staphylococcal substrains {{resistant}} to sulphonamides were developed from sensitive parent strains by subcultivation in increasing concentrations of sulphathiazole. As {{compared with the}} parent strains, {{the growth of the}} resistant strains was 20 - 200 -fold less sensitive to sulphathia-zole in a semi-defined medium based on acid hydrolyzed casein than were the parent strains. Inhibition of growth by sulphathiazole was overcome competitively by p-aminobenzoic acid. The inhibition indices of the sulphathiazole-sensitive strains were about 10, and 10 @- 1000 for the resistant substrains; the change in index was about proportional to the degree of resistance. The sulphathiazole-resistant strains were cross-{{resistant to}} <b>other</b> <b>sulphonamides</b> but were not resistant to p-nitrobenzoic acid. Not one of the sensitive or resistant strains was inhibited by aminopterin. No change in the inhibitory effect of sulphathiazole occurred during growth of cultures in its presence, though the drug was partly converted to a second substance (of unknown structure). Resistant and sensitive pairs of strains formed similar amounts of unknown compound, so that it is unlikely that its formation has to do with resistance. Concentrated suspensions of organisms of all strains took up similar amounts of [~~S]-sulphathiazole when incubated in the growth medium. The attach-ment of the drug to the organisms was weak, but the uptake was not altered by the presence of p-aminobenzoic acid. The rates of aerobic growth and the nutritional requirements for anaerobic growth of sensitive and resistant strains were generally similar. The nutritional requirements for vitamins and amino acids varied among the sensitive strains, but there were only slight differences between resistant and sensitive pairs of strains...|$|E

Their crystallographic data show that: (a) boat-chair (BC) conformation of dioxepinoazirine and cyclohepta[b]azirine moieties dominates; (b) the substituent on aziridine nitrogen {{is always in}} trans and never in cis position {{in relation to the}} cycloheptane or dioxepane ring; (c) the sulphonyl group of sulphonylaziridines 6 and 8 - 10 adopts only one of the two possible conformations in relation to the aziridine ring, with torsion angles C 1 -S-N-C 7 of ≅ 80 ° (corresponding angle O 1 -S-N-LP ≅ 180 °, LP = lone pair) named by us conformation BC*; (d) orientation of the analogous carbonyl group of 11 and methylene group of 12 is defined by torsion angles C 1 -C 0 -N 1 -C 7 of - 78. 3 (9) ° and - 93. 9 (5) ° respectively; (e) nitrogen atom in all studied N-sulphonyl-, acyl- and alkyl- aziridines is sp 3 hybridised, in contrast to <b>other</b> <b>sulphonamides</b> where sp 2 hybridisation is predominant; (f) nitrogen atom in alkylaziridine 12 is more pyramidal in relation to N-sulphonyl and N-acyl derivatives, and according to torsion angles 05 -N 2 -C 4 -C 5, the nitro group in all studied compounds is approximately coplanar to the phenyl ring plane. Obtained data will serve for further investigation of steric and electronic properties of studied compounds aimed at designing more antihyperglycaemically potent analogues...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Pharm. (Pharmacy Practice)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. The most {{frequent}} intervention performed by physicians is {{the writing of}} a prescription. Modern medicine has been remarkably effective in managing diseases. Medicines play {{a fundamental role in}} the effectiveness, efficiency and responsiveness of health care systems. However, health care expenditure is a great cause for concern and many nations around the world struggle to contain rising health care costs. Pharmaceutical benefit management programmes such as pharmacoeconomics, drug utilisation review (DUR) and disease management have emerged as control tools to ensure cost effective selection and use of medicine. These managed care instruments are often used to determine whether new strategies or interventions, such as the implementation of a managed medicine reference price list, are appropriate and have "value". The general objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the influences of the implementation of a managed medicine reference price list on the usage and cost of antibiotic medicine in the private health care sector of South Africa. The research design used in this study was retrospective, non-experimental and quantitative. The data used for the analysis were obtained over a two-year study period (1 May 2001 to 31 April 2003) from the central medicine claims database of Medschem&. Data was analysed according to prevalence, cost and original (innovator) or generic medicine items. For the purpose of this study antibiotics referred to beta-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins and "others"), erythromycin and <b>other</b> macrolides, tetracyclines, <b>sulphonamides</b> and combinations, quinolones, chloramphenicol and aminoglycosides. The results of the empirical investigation showed the total number of medicine items claimed during the study period amounted to 49098736 medicine items having a total expenditure of R 7150344897. 00. There was a decrease in the prevalence of original (innovator) products during the two-year period. The prevalence of generic products increased from 25. 87 % to 32. 47 %. A total of 4092495 antibiotic medicine items were claimed with a total cost of R 526309279. 43 representing 7. 36 % (n = R 7150344897. 00) of all pharmaceutical products purchased during the two-year period. Original antibiotics had a prevalence of 42. 32 %, while generic antibiotics constituted 57. 68 % of all antibiotic products claimed (n = 4092495). However, original (innovator) products contributed 62. 32 % and generic products 37. 68 % to the total cost of all antibiotics claimed. It was concluded that the beta-lactam antibiotics represented 56. 99 % of all antibiotics claimed (n = 4092495) and contributed 52. 51 % to the total antibiotic expenditure (n = R 526309279. 43) for the two-year period. The average cost of beta-lactam items ranged between R 112. 88 * 69. 95 and R 122. 18 + 81. 42. The Medschema Price List (MPL) was implemented in May 2001. The aim of this reference pricing system was to allocate a ceiling price to a group of drugs, which are similar in terms of composition, clinical efficacy, safety and quality, with the ultimate goal to reduce medicine expenditure. During the year of implementation of the MPL 62. 24 % of beta-lactam antibiotics claimed (n = 1303464) were MPL listed. These products contributed 43. 25 % to the total cost of all beta-lactam antibiotics (n = R 157142778. 38). Medical aid companies reimbursed R 61649211. 86 for penicillins claimed and MPL listed. If all penicillin products were claimed at the ceiling price set by the MPL, a cost saving of 2. 79 % could have been achieved. Cost analysis indicated that it is possible to reduce health care costs by implementing strategies with the aim to reduce medicine cost. Further research, however, is necessary and in this regard recommendations for further research were formulated. Master...|$|R
