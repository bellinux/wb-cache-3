5|$|To {{compose the}} film score, Burton hired regular {{collaborator}} Danny Elfman, {{who had previously}} been set as composer when Adam Rifkin was to do his remake in 1989. Elfman noted that his work <b>on</b> <b>Planet</b> of the Apes contained more percussion instruments than usual.|$|E
5|$|Category5 hurricanes are {{tropical}} cyclones {{that reach}} Category5 intensity on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. They are by definition the strongest hurricanes that can form <b>on</b> <b>planet</b> Earth. They are {{rare in the}} eastern Pacific Ocean and generally form only once every several years. In general, Category5s form in clusters in single years. Landfalls by such storms are rare due to the generally westerly path of tropical cyclones in the northern hemisphere.|$|E

5|$|In Legacy of the Void, it is {{revealed}} that before Fenix's defeat at Antioch in StarCraft, his personality was cloned and inserted into an experimental mechanical body of ancient Purifiers. This body was locked inside a stasis vault <b>on</b> <b>planet</b> Glacius. Artanis obtained Fenix {{and with his}} help {{he was able to}} gain the Purifiers as allies against Amon. During the campaign he concludes that despite having Fenix's memories, he was a different being. Because of this he changed his name to Talandar.|$|E
5|$|An {{improved}} {{mathematical analysis}} of Cassini data by astrophysicists Matthew Holman and Matthew Payne tightened the constraints on possible locations of Planet Nine. Holman and Payne developed {{a more efficient}} model {{that allowed them to}} explore a broader range of parameters than the previous analysis. The parameters identified using this technique to analyze the Cassini data was then intersected with Batygin and Brown's dynamical constraints <b>on</b> <b>Planet</b> Nine's orbit. Holman and Payne concluded that Planet Nine is most likely to be located within 20° of RA = 40°, Dec = −15°, in an area of the sky near the constellation Cetus.|$|E
5|$|Convinced that Fizzwidget is {{unaware of}} the Protopet's flaws, Ratchet goes to warn him during a promotionary event being held <b>on</b> <b>planet</b> Boldan, only to {{discover}} {{it to be a}} trap by the Thugs-4-Less boss, after cancelling their contract with Angela to work with MegaCorp. Captured, the pair find themselves transported to Aranos and aboard the same vessel, now being used as a remote prison, but manage to escape confinement. Discovering that Angela was captured by them, the pair track the mercenaries to their hideout <b>on</b> <b>planet</b> Snivelak, defeating their boss and saving Angela. Intent on stopping Fizzwidget, the group head for MegaCrop's Headquarters, only to discover that the CEO is none other than disgraced hero Captain Qwark. In a bid to restore his reputation, Qwark took over MegaCorp as Fizzwidget, with the intention of unleashing the Protopet upon the galaxy, so he can use a device created by Angela to defeat the creatures and make himself famous again. When he demonstrates the device, however, it malfunctions and transforms the original Protopet into a gigantic beast that devours him. While Angela goes to rescue the real Fizzwidget, Ratchet subdues the Protopet and saves Qwark's life. With Clank's help, Angela fixes the device and broadcasts a signal through MegaCorp's TV transponders, neutralizing the Protopets and restoring peace to the Bogon galaxy.|$|E
2500|$|A third {{assumption}} {{is to focus}} <b>on</b> <b>planets</b> orbiting Sun-like stars for increased probabilities of planetary habitability. Very large stars have relatively short lifetimes, meaning that life might {{not have time to}} emerge <b>on</b> <b>planets</b> orbiting them. Very small stars provide so little heat and warmth that only planets in very close orbits around them would not be frozen solid, and in such close orbits these planets would be tidally [...] "locked" [...] to the star. The long lifetimes of red dwarfs could allow the development of habitable environments <b>on</b> <b>planets</b> with thick atmospheres. This is significant, as red dwarfs are extremely common. (See Habitability of red dwarf systems).|$|R

After being repaired, Clank (real name XJ-0461) reveals {{that he is}} on a mission to stop Chairman Drek, a corrupt business tycoon who harvests inhabited planets to create a new one for his race, the Blarg. Joining forces, the two take out several of Drek's operations one-by-one while gathering gradual information on his plans. This move enrages Drek, who subsequently launches a manhunt for the duo.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma is in a humid {{subtropical}} region. Oklahoma lies in {{a transition}} zone between humid continental climate to the north, semi-arid climate to the west, and humid subtropical climate in the central, south and eastern portions of the state. Most of the state {{lies in a}}n area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold, dry air from Canada, warm to hot, dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces severe weather (severe thunderstorms, damaging thunderstorm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else <b>on</b> <b>planet</b> Earth. An average 62 tornadoes strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world.|$|E
5|$|One year later, the Alliance hires Katarn again, {{this time}} to {{investigate}} an assault {{on one of their}} bases by a new type of Imperial soldier. His investigation reveals the Imperial Dark Trooper project, led by Human General Rom Mohc (Jack Angel). His mission to stop the project takes him to the sewers of Anoat City <b>on</b> <b>planet</b> Anoat, where he captures Moff Rebus, an Imperial weapons specialist Human who developed the Dark Trooper weapon. Rebus' interrogation leads Katarn to a weapons research facility in the mountains of Fest and the Gromas mines where minerals are extracted for the Dark Troopers.|$|E

5|$|The team {{considered}} several ideas, {{including a}} return to a post-apocalyptic earth and the conquest of another planet in the Alpha Centauri system, before deciding to keep the new title <b>on</b> <b>Planet.</b> The premise allowed them to mix and match old and new characters and delve into the mysteries of the monoliths and alien artifacts. The backstory evolved quickly, and the main conflict centered on the return of the original alien inhabitants. The idea of humans inadvertently caught up in an off-world civil war focused the story.|$|E
5|$|A {{year has}} past since the {{encounter}} with Beerus. Goku and Vegeta had been training under Whis who had taken them as his students to master on controlling their flow of energy, maintaining it from within themselves. During this time, the remaining remnant of Frieza's army had went to earth to use the dragon balls to revive the long dead galactic ruler. Being revived and regenerated from the army's latest technology of regeneration, Frieza had began to plot his revenge on Goku who had defeated him <b>on</b> <b>planet</b> Namek. Learning that he had defeated Majin Buu, one of two beings warned not to fight with from his father; the other being Beerus, Frieza decided to begin intense training to reach new heights of power to face Goku. Frieza's army had arrived on Earth while Goku and Vegeta still training with Whis. Tien, Piccolo, Gohan, Krillin, and Master Roshi had fought the remnant until their return. Once arriving on Earth, Frieza and Goku had fought showing their latest forms and power. Goku achieved a form beyond the Super Saiyan God form being the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (Super Sayian Blue). Frieza revealed his new form achieved after training stating he has not done before, calling it his Golden form.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{had never}} been {{particularly}} close to his parents, but his father's death in October 2000 and his mother's in March 2002 affected him deeply. Following the production of Planet of the Apes (2001), the director {{wanted to get back}} to making a smaller film. Burton enjoyed the script, feeling that it was the first unique story he was offered since Beetlejuice (1988). Burton also found appeal in the story's combination of an emotional drama with exaggerated tall tales, which allowed him to tell various stories of different genres. He signed to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with Burton <b>on</b> <b>Planet</b> of the Apes, to join Big Fish as a producer. Zanuck also had a difficult relationship with his own father, Darryl F. Zanuck, who once fired him as head of production at 20th Century Fox.|$|E

5|$|Following their {{previous}} adventure, after saving the galaxy and defeating Chairman Drek, Ratchet and Clank become celebrities, though their lives remain otherwise uneventful. After giving {{an interview for}} the holovision show Behind the Hero, the pair suddenly find themselves teleported to the Bogon galaxy by Abercrombie Fizzwidget, the founder and CEO of MegaCorp, the galaxy's largest maker of consumer goods and electronics, who requests Ratchet's help to recover a stolen biological experiment from a masked thief, while offering Clank employment in the company, both of whom agree to the opportunities offered. Upon completing an extensive training regime, Ratchet is tasked to travel to a flying laboratory <b>on</b> <b>planet</b> Aranos where the experiment was last seen, but before he can retrieve it, the thief manages to escape with it. Reporting back to Fizzwidget, Ratchet soon begins pursuing the thief, only to receive a video message showing that the culprit has captured Clank.|$|E
5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt. In the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life <b>on</b> <b>planet</b> Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E
5|$|Metroid: Zero Mission {{takes place}} <b>on</b> <b>Planet</b> Zebes, a large, {{open-ended}} world with areas connected by doors and elevators. The player controls Samus Aran as she travels through the planet's caverns and environments, hunting Space Pirates. Along the way, the player collects power-ups that enhance Samus's armor and weaponry, {{as well as}} grant her special abilities. These abilities allow Samus to access areas that were previously inaccessible, so that the game can be played linearly or non-linearly. For example, the player may come across underground caverns that bypass certain sections, a method termed sequence breaking. To save their progress, players can enter either Save Rooms or Samus's ship on Crateria. As a remake of Metroid, Metroid: Zero Missions layout bears a resemblance to the original, and various powerups and items make reappearances from previous games in the series, with similar uses, effects, and appearances. However, the game adds new items, areas, and mini-bosses, {{as well as a}} completely new area named Chozodia.|$|E

5|$|Vulcanoids, {{being an}} entirely new class of {{celestial}} bodies, would be interesting in their own right, but discovering {{whether or not they}} exist would yield insights into the formation and evolution of the Solar System. If they exist they might contain material left over from the earliest period of planet formation, and help determine the conditions under which the terrestrial planets, particularly Mercury, formed. In particular, if vulcanoids exist or did exist in the past, they would represent an additional population of impactors that have affected no other planet but Mercury, making that planet's surface appear older than it actually is. If vulcanoids are found not to exist, this would place different constraints <b>on</b> <b>planet</b> formation and suggest that other processes have been at work in the inner Solar System, such as planetary migration clearing out the area.|$|E
5|$|After a brief {{memorial}} for Qwark on the Phoenix, Ratchet goes {{to assist}} Ranger forces battling a Tyhrranoid invasion {{in the city}} of Metropolis. Unveiling his newly completed Biobliterator, Nefarious uses it to turn both Metropolis's citizens and his Tyhrranoid soldiers into robots. Making yet another escape, he orders Klunk to kill Ratchet. After besting the clone, Ratchet and Clank are reunited and vow to stop Nefarious. While searching the remains of the Leviathan, they find evidence that Qwark faked his death. A secret message hidden on board the Phoenix reveals the location of a secret hideout, where Qwark, overcome with cowardice, refuses to fight any longer. After fighting off an attack on the Phoenix, the duo intercept the Biobliterator and Clank destroys it with an ion cannon. However, Sasha informs them that a second, more advanced, Biobliterator is being prepped for launch at Nefarious's main command center <b>on</b> <b>planet</b> Mylon, Ratchet and Clank locate Nefarious and defeat him, but he activates the Biobliterator, which transforms into a giant, heavily armed robot. Before he can crush the two, a reinvigorated Qwark flies in to distract him, giving the duo an opening to destroy the Biobliterator. Nefarious's teleporter malfunctions, stranding him and his butler Lawrence on a distant asteroid. With Nefarious defeated, the Q-Force and their allies attend a private screening of the latest Secret Agent Clank holofilm.|$|E
