5|$|Thallium(I) bromide and thallium(I) iodide {{crystals}} {{have been}} used as infrared <b>optical</b> <b>materials,</b> because they are harder than other common infrared optics, and because they have transmission at significantly longer wavelengths. The trade name KRS-5 refers to this material. Thallium(I) oxide has been used to manufacture glasses that have a high index of refraction. Combined with sulfur or selenium and arsenic, thallium has been used in the production of high-density glasses that have low melting points in the range of 125 and 150 °C. These glasses have room temperature properties that are similar to ordinary glasses and are durable, insoluble in water and have unique refractive indices.|$|E

The layer of composite <b>optical</b> <b>material</b> has substantially uniform thickness. The composite <b>optical</b> <b>material</b> is a polymer opal, in {{that it has a}} three dimensional arrangement of core particles distributed in a matrix, the refractive index of the material of the core particles being different to the refractive index of the material of the matrix and the three dimensional arrangement being capable of having a periodicity such that, when a surface of the material is illuminated with white light, the composite material exhibits structural colour. The local stiffness of the substrate is different at different positions of the substrate. The effect of this is that, on mechanical deformation of the composite optical device, the substrate is deformed to a different extent at different positions of the substrate and the layer of composite <b>optical</b> <b>material</b> is correspondingly deformed to a different extent at different positions of the layer of composite <b>optical</b> <b>material.</b> This provides local variation in the structural colour response of the layer of composite <b>optical</b> <b>material</b> on mechanical deformation of the composite optical device...|$|R

2500|$|Some {{media have}} {{an index of}} {{refraction}} which varies gradually with position and, thus, light rays in the medium are curved.

40|$|Abstract. Characteristics of silica <b>optical</b> <b>material</b> largely {{depend on}} its thermal history. In this paper, {{formation}} of thermally induced defects in silica <b>optical</b> <b>material</b> is studied. The formation process of defect is analyzed in detail. The {{results show that}} there is an obvious difference in defect formation induced by heating treatment when the composition of silica <b>optical</b> <b>material</b> changes. Defect formation mainly displays as the produce process when the initial defects of the silica material are zero. However, defect formation expresses as the produce and annealing process when the initial defects of the silica material are not zero. The initial defect concentration can be decreased significantly when the silica material is heated in high temperature. At the same time, the new defect is also produced. These theoretic results are consistent with the previous experimental ones...|$|R

2500|$|Light {{or other}} {{electromagnetic}} radiation from many sources, {{such as the}} sun, flames, and incandescent lamps, consists of short wave trains with an equal mixture of polarizations; this is called unpolarized light. [...] Polarized light can be produced by passing unpolarized light through a polarizing filter, which allows waves of only one polarization to pass through. [...] The most common <b>optical</b> <b>materials</b> (such as glass) are isotropic and do not affect the polarization of light passing through them; however, some materials—those that exhibit birefringence, dichroism, or optical activity—can change the polarization of light. [...] Some of these are used to make polarizing filters. [...] Light is also partially polarized when it reflects from a surface.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the year}} 2000, David R. Smith's team of UCSD {{researchers}} produced {{a new class}} of composite materials by depositing a structure onto a circuit-board substrate consisting of a series of thin copper split-rings and ordinary wire segments strung parallel to the rings. This material exhibited unusual physical properties that had never been observed in nature. These materials obey the laws of physics, but behave differently from normal materials. In essence these negative-index metamaterials were noted for having the ability to reverse many of the physical properties that govern the behavior of ordinary <b>optical</b> <b>materials.</b> One of those unusual properties is the ability to reverse, for the first time, Snell's law of refraction. Until the demonstration of negative refractive index for microwaves by the UCSD team, the material had been unavailable. Advances during the 1990s in fabrication and computation abilities allowed these first metamaterials to be constructed. Thus, the [...] "new" [...] metamaterial was tested for the effects described by Victor Veselago 30 years earlier. Studies of this experiment, which followed shortly thereafter, announced that other effects had occurred.|$|E

2500|$|In 1968 Victor Veselago's paper {{showed that}} the {{opposite}} directions of EM plane waves and the flow of energy {{was derived from the}} individual Maxwell curl equations. In ordinary <b>optical</b> <b>materials,</b> the curl equation for the electric field show a [...] "right hand rule" [...] for the directions of the electric field E, the magnetic induction B, and wave propagation, which goes in the direction of [...] wave vector k. However, the direction of energy flow formed by E × H is right-handed only when permeability is greater than zero. This means that when permeability is less than zero, e.g. negative, wave propagation is reversed (determined by k), and contrary to the direction of energy flow. Furthermore, the relations of vectors E, H, and k form a [...] "left-handed" [...] system – and it was Veselago who coined the term [...] "left-handed" [...] (LH) material, which is in wide use today (2011). He contended that an LH material has a negative refractive index and relied on the steady-state solutions of Maxwell's equations as a center for his argument.|$|E
