50|$|The {{bridge is}} also the home of Trowse Signal Box, which {{controls}} most of the Bittern Line from Whitlingham Junction to Sheringham. The line was resignalled in 2000, leading to the closure {{of a number of}} mechanical signal boxes with control moving to Trowse, although it is arguable if this is a real improvement since {{there have been a number}} of serious failures causing full or partial suspension of service during electrical storms. This is due to the system using high frequency pulses in the rail as opposed to standard track circuits to <b>operate</b> <b>level</b> crossings. The resignalling saw the end of one of the few remaining sections of single track main line controlled by tokens. The signalling meant Cromer Signal box that the last surviving M&GN example was decommissioned; however it has been saved as a museum.|$|E

In such systems, different levels of operation may be defined, and switching between <b>operating</b> <b>levels</b> occurs at certain thresholds of system congestion.

40|$|Abstraction {{has emerged}} as a key {{component}} in solving extensive-form games of incomplete information. However, loss-less abstractions are typically too large to solve, so lossy abstraction is needed. All prior lossy abstraction algorithms for extensive-form games either 1) had no bounds on solution quality or 2) depended on specific equilibrium computation ap-proaches, limited forms of abstraction, and only decreased the number of information sets rather than nodes in the game tree. We introduce a theoretical framework {{that can be used to}} give bounds on solution quality for any perfect-recall extensive-form game. The framework uses a new notion for mapping abstract strategies to the original game, and it leverages a new equilibrium refinement for analysis. Using this framework, we develop the first general lossy extensive-form game abstrac-tion method with bounds. Experiments show that it finds a lossless abstraction when one is available and lossy abstractions when smaller abstractions are desired. While our framework can be used for lossy abstraction, it is also a powerful tool for lossless abstraction if we set the bound to zero. Prior abstraction algorithms typically <b>operate</b> <b>level</b> by level in the game tree. We introduce the extensive-form game tree isomorphism and action subset selection problems, both important problems for computing abstractions on a level-by-level basis. We show that the former is graph isomorphism complete, and the latter NP-complete. We also prove that level-by-level abstraction can be too myopic and thus fail to find even obvious lossless abstractions...|$|E

40|$|Purpose Cervical disc {{prostheses}} induce {{significant amount}} of artifact in magnetic resonance imaging which may complicate radiologic follow-up after surgery. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate as to what extent the artifact, induced by the frequently used Discover® cervical disc prosthesis, impedes interpretation of the MR images at <b>operated</b> and adjacent <b>levels</b> in 1. 5 and 3 Tesla MR. Methods Ten subsequent patients were investigated in both 1. 5 and 3 Tesla MR with standard image sequences one year following anterior cervical discectomy with arthroplasty. Outcome measures Two neuroradiologists evaluated the images by consensus. Emphasis was made on signal changes in medulla at all levels and visualization of root canals at <b>operated</b> and adjacent <b>levels.</b> A “blur artifact ratio” was calculated and defined as the height of the artifact on T 1 sagittal images related to the <b>operated</b> <b>level.</b> Results The artifacts induced in 1. 5 and 3 Tesla MR were of entirely different character and evaluation of the spinal cord at <b>operated</b> <b>level</b> was impossible in both magnets. Artifacts also made the root canals difficult to assess at <b>operated</b> <b>level</b> and more pronounced in the 3 Tesla MR. At the adjacent levels however, the spinal cord and root canals were completely visualized in all patients. The “blur artifact” induced at <b>operated</b> <b>level</b> was also more pronounced in the 3 Tesla MR. Conclusions The artifact induced by the Discover® titanium disc prosthesis in both 1. 5 and 3 Tesla MR, makes interpretation of the spinal cord impossible and visualization of the root canals difficult at <b>operated</b> <b>level.</b> Adjusting the MR sequences to produce the least amount of artifact is important. © The Author(s) 2013 Open Access This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License which permits any use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and the source are credited...|$|R
