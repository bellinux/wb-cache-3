There are some additional influences from the works of Thomas Browne and Saint John of the Cross.

40|$|Before {{the dawn}} of {{democracy}} in South Africa, in the methodological debates that were associated with who the interlocutor <b>of</b> Black <b>Theology</b> <b>of</b> liberation was, there was a tacit understanding that not everyone who is black is necessarily an interlocutor <b>of</b> Black <b>Theology</b> <b>of</b> liberation. The changes arising from globalisation which coincided with the demise of apartheid seem to have diffused the clarity of interlocution in the Black <b>Theology</b> <b>of</b> liberation school as it was sought before.
