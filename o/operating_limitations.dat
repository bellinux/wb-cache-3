2500|$|In September 2008, an {{independent}} {{review of the}} safety and functionality of the ship revealed that some <b>operating</b> <b>limitations</b> {{will have to be}} accepted, as sea-keeping performance is poor in high sea states. The [...] "selection of a commercial Roll-on, Roll-off (Ro-Ro) design" [...] has [...] "been at the root of differences of opinion between Tenix, the Ministry of Defence and New Zealand Defence Force and the shortfalls in performance". The issues included that the propellers can come out of the water when the ship pitches in rough seas, with concern that this may affect the ship's machinery. The report also recommended relocating the ship's boats (or protecting them from waves if relocation was not possible) and adding more ballast or improving the ballasting system of Canterbury.|$|E
2500|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{determined}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} pilot in command (PIC) allowing the aircraft to be loaded beyond its <b>operating</b> <b>limitations.</b> The required pre-flight weight and balance computations would have shown it was dangerously overloaded and also outside its weight and balance operating envelope, but in this instance the pilot in command, as a former military pilot, was neither accustomed to nor responsible for computing weight and balance computations during his military career, as this was the responsibility of the military loadmaster, and thus it is believed he may have by force of habit overlooked this responsibility as a civilian pilot is required to do. Don Alan Burmeister was a former United States Marine Corps aviator, but FAA records show he had very limited experience / training in flying conventional (vs. centerline thrust) twin engine aircraft. [...] Records show it was only a short time prior to the accident (6/9/82) that he completed a check-ride to remove the [...] "centerline thrust" [...] restriction from his pilot's certificate. This check-ride should have fully evaluated his ability to fly a conventional multi-engine aircraft throughout its designed range of operations, but the flight examiner was decertified the next month (7/10/82) by the FAA due to a [...] "history of incomplete or substandard check-rides". Additionally, the insurance carrier (Ideal Mutual Insurance Co.) required Burmeister to log 1,045 hrs of flying time, attend a Cessna ground and flight training course, as well as log 15 hours in a Cessna 414 (C-414) prior to acting as the PIC of the leased aircraft. The NTSB record shows he failed to accomplish all of these requirements, with disastrous results. With pilot and eleven passengers, the aircraft was overloaded by an estimated , and the location of the center of gravity was found to be [...] beyond the maximum aft limit. Combined with an air temperature of , creating a condition known as [...] "hot and high" [...] (high density altitude, producing a lower climb rate on takeoff and greater danger of stalling), the C-414 could do little but struggle into the air within ground effect, and once airborne was left virtually uncontrollable. These factors prevented the aircraft from ever attaining sufficient altitude, and it crashed into trees {{less than a mile from}} the airport.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the field {{experience with a}} new kind of GPS based train control system for branch lines which are operated by radio-based operational train control. Most branch lines with such <b>operating</b> <b>limitation</b> cannot afford the cost investment for modern signalling systems. The train control system presented herein is a low cost solution which improves safety, makes operation easier, and introduces an interesting level of automation without costly line-side installations. It is based on autonomous determination of train location using differential GPS and an odometer with data radio communication between the central computer and the on-board computer in the train. In Austria, this system has been in full operation since 2006 on several single-track lines with a total length of approx. 90 km. This paper will therefore present the experience with this GPS based train control system and its safety aspects...|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} {{physical}} model based on disordered (a hole punched inside a material) monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) {{to demonstrate a}} large-gap quantum valley Hall insulator. We find an emergence of bound states lying inside the bulk gap of the TMDs. They are strongly affected by spin-valley coupling, rest- and kinetic- mass terms and the hole size. In addition, in {{the whole range of}} the hole size, at least two in-gap bound states with opposite angular momentum, circulating {{around the edge of the}} hole, exist. Their topological insulator (TI) feature is analyzed by the Chern number, characterized by spacial distribution of their probabilities and confirmed by energy dispersion curves (Energy vs. angular momentum). It not only sheds light on overcoming low-temperature <b>operating</b> <b>limitation</b> of existing narrow-gap TIs, but also opens an opportunity to realize valley- and spin- qubits.

40|$|The {{open-loop}} control scheme presented in part I {{of this paper}} for a dual five-level-inverter-fed induction motor(IM) drive with two dc power supplies maintains dc-link capacitor voltage balancing and common-mode voltage (CMV) elimination throughout the operating range of the drive. The <b>operating</b> <b>limitation</b> of the proposed {{open-loop control}} scheme to take corrective action toward the existing unbalance in the dc-link-capacitor voltages is also pointed out in part I of this paper. As a solution to this, a simple closed-loop control scheme, which is based only on the switching-state redundancy, is proposed {{in this part of}} the paper. The proposed closed-loop control scheme not only prevents further unbalancing of capacitor voltages but also takes corrective actions to bring back the capacitor voltages in the balanced state. The proposed closed-loop scheme achieves dc-link capacitor voltage balancing and elimination of CMV together in the complete modulation range, including overmodulation of up to the 24 -step operation. The proposed control scheme does not affect the output fundamental voltage generated by the inverter, as it effectively utilizes only the availability of redundant switching states of the inverter, and does not call for additional power circuit hardware. The scheme is presented with the simulation studies and experimentally verified with a 1. 5 -kW open-end winding IM drive...|$|R

Optimizing extreme-scale applications to <b>operate</b> within power <b>limitations</b> will require new techniques for understanding the relationships between application characterization, performance, and energy. The main contributions of this work are: 1) a methodology for the time and energy modeling of high-performance computing applications that can scale to a large number of nodes, 2) characterization of the different ways time and energy are affected by degree of parallelism and processor clock frequency, and 3) optimization of performance under a power cap when scheduling applications, both bulk-synchronous and data-parallel task-based application models.
