30|$|Due to the {{widespread}} use of nanocarbon materials (NCMs), more researchers are studying their tribological performances. In this work, the tribological behaviors of the following five types of NCMs with different geometric shapes were evaluated in a novel oil-in-water system: spherical fullerenes (C 60, 0 D), tubular multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT, 1 D), sheet graphene oxide (GO, 2 D), sheet graphene oxide derivative (Oct-O-GO, 2 D), and lamellar graphite (G, 3 D). Among these, GO with two types of oxidation degrees, i.e., GO(1), GO(2), and Oct-O-GO(1) were synthesized and characterized using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and contact angle measurements. The load-carrying capacity of the NCM emulsions were evaluated using a four-ball test machine, and the lubrication performances were investigated using a high-frequency reciprocating friction and wear tester with a sliding distance of 1, 800 mm under different loads (50 N and 100 N) at 0.5 Hz. The results revealed that the Oct-O-GO(1) emulsion exhibited the best load-carrying capacity, and the best friction-reducing and anti-wear properties compared to <b>other</b> <b>emulsions.</b> Moreover, the anti-wear advantage was more prominent under high load conditions, whereas the <b>other</b> <b>emulsions</b> exhibited a certain degree of abrasive or adhesive wear. The lubrication mechanism was determined through the analysis of worn surfaces using scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, micro-Raman spectroscopy, and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results revealed that during frictional sliding, the ingredients in the emulsion can absorb and react with the freshly exposed metal surface to form surface-active films to protect the surfaces from abrasion. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} higher the amount of ingredients that contain alkyl and O-H/C=O, the better was the lubrication performance in addition to an increase in the carbon residue in the tribofilm generated on the meal surface.|$|E

Methods: PMN and PBMC were exposed to emulsions at concentrations ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 04 %. Lipid body formation was assessed by microscopy, fatty acid composition by gas chromatography and eicosanoids by ELISA. Results: Stimulation of inflammatory cells and exposure to lipid emulsions promoted the formation of lipid bodies, but there {{did not appear to}} be differential effects of the emulsions tested. In contrast, there were differential effects of lipid emulsions on eicosanoid formation, particularly with regards to LTB 4 production by PMN. Omegaven dramatically increased production of eicosanoids compared with the <b>other</b> <b>emulsions</b> in a dose-dependent manner. This effect was associated with a significantly higher level of lipid peroxides in the supernatants of cells exposed to Omegaven. Conclusions: Stimulation of inflammatory cells and exposure to lipid emulsions promotes lipid body formation and eicosanoid production, although the differential effects of different emulsions appear to be largely due to lipid peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in some emulsions in this in vitro system.

Endothelial cells within the vasculature are crucial components necessary for maintenance of normal coagulation and immune function. METHODS: We compared the effects of three commercial lipid emulsions (LEs; Intralipid®, ClinOleic® [or Clinolipid®], and Omegaven®) differing in the levels of omega- 6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, omega- 9 monounsaturated fatty acids, and saturated fatty acids upon endothelial cell fatty acid composition using Gas chromatography, endothelial cell integrity by assessing measurement of apoptosis and necrosis using flow cytometry, endothelial cell inflammatory activation by assessing the induction of ICAM- 1 by lipopolysaccharide [LPS]), and transcription factor activation (phosphorylation of NF-κB) using western blot analysis. RESULTS: Gas chromatographic analysis confirmed cellular uptake of the fatty acids within the LEs; furthermore, these fatty acid changes reflected {{the composition of the}} oils and egg phosphatides used in the manufacturing of these emulsions. However, the kinetics of fatty acid uptake and processing differed between LEs. Fish oil LE negatively impacted cell viability by doubling the percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cell populations quantified by flow cytometry using Annexin V/Fluorescein and propidium iodide. The soybean oil LE did not alter cell viability, while the olive oil-predominate emulsion improved cell viability. All LEs were capable of suppressing LPS-induced ICAM- 1 expression; however, the fish oil LE was more potent than the <b>other</b> <b>emulsions.</b> Fish oil LE supplementation of cells also suppressed LPS-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB, while the soybean oil and olive predominant LE had no effect upon NF-κB phosphorylation. CONCLUSIONS: Lipid emulsions are readily incorporated and stored in the form of triacylglycerols.

Microgels are colloidal dispersions of cross-linked gel particles with the ability to swell in response to a change of physicochemical parameters (pH, temperature, ionic strength, etc.). In the last few years, microgels have been investigated due to their biocompatibility, their high water content and their use of biocompatible polymers such as proteins and polysaccharides. Moreover, their controlled drug release at the target site improves the drug efficacy and reduces side effects. The (W/W) emulsions have been formed by a dispersion of an aqueous phase into another aqueous solution. Two mutually immiscible hydrophilic polymers have been used. As <b>other</b> <b>emulsions,</b> (W/W) emulsions are no thermodynamically stable.

In a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, 4 emulsions containing 30 g of fat in a 350 -mL preload were consumed by 10 men and 10 women (BMI = 25. 1 ± 2. 8 kg/m(2); age = 58. 8 ± 4. 8 y). Pre- and postprandial plasma TG, cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), and peptide YY (PYY) concentrations and food intake were measured. In a second experiment in a subset of the participants (n = 8, 4 men and 4 women), (13) C-labeled mixed TG was incorporated into 2 different emulsions and breath (13) C was measured over 6 h. In the first experiment, the postprandial rise in plasma TG concentrations following the CasMag-stabilized emulsion containing 30 % solid fat was lower than all <b>other</b> <b>emulsions</b> at 90 and 120 min (P < 0. 05).

Food intake at a test meal, eaten 3 h after the preload, did not differ among the emulsions. In the second experiment, when measured by the (13) C breath test, 25 % of the TG in the CasMag emulsion was absorbed and metabolized compared with control.

The prepared emulsions were analyzed for their storage stability and properties (colour, particle size, zeta potential and rheology). The effects of various factors (freezing/thawing, heating, pH, salts and ionic strength) on the stability of emulsions were also investigated. All emulsions prepared with an O/W ratio of 7 : 3, regardless {{of the type of}} milk fat, rendered a highly condensed, semi solid and cream-like substance whereas <b>other</b> <b>emulsions</b> containing less oil were in a liquid form. Among the four different O/W ratios tested, the highest emulsion stability during the storage of 12 weeks was observed from the emulsions containing 1 : 9 O/W ratios, due to a combine effect of smaller emulsion particle size and lower collision frequency between droplets. Interestingly, the emulsions with 7 : 3 O/W ratios were found to be more stable than the ones with 5 : 5 O/W ratios. This might be due to the limited movements of closely-packed emulsion droplets induced by the high oil concentration of 7 : 3 O/W ratios. The emulsion stability was significantly affected by low pH, especially at lower than pH 4, due to the loss of electrostatic repulsions between droplets leading to droplet coalescence and also possibly due to hydrolysis of rhamnolipid molecules. The presence of salts (NaCl, KCl and CaCl 2) also rendered the emulsion unstable. The degree of instability was gradually increased with increasing salt concentrations. CaCl 2 had the most significant effect even at a very low concentration. The viscosity of emulsions increased with increasing oil concentration but was not affected by the types of milk fats. Emulsions with 3 : 7, 5 : 5 and 7 : 3 O/W ratios exhibited non-Newtonian and shear thinning flow behaviour.

40|$|Emulsions exhibit great {{utility in}} a wide variety of industries, ranging from food, cosmetics, drugs, polishes, and {{agriculture}} to paving materials, paints, coatings, photography, and electrically and thermally insulating materials. Surfactants stabilize these emulsions by creating a barrier to coalescence of the constituent droplets. In the case of molecular surfactants, this stabilization is achieved by lowering the interfacial tension in a mixture whereas colloidal or particle surfactants prevent coalescence via steric stabilization of the interface. The type of emulsion formed is dictated by the surfactant’s preference to be dispersed or the particle’s preference to be wetted by one phase over the <b>other.</b> <b>Emulsions</b> of both the surfactant- and particle-stabilized varieties can be very useful in providing templates for polymerization reactions. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) (two-dimensional) and glass capillary (three- dimensional) microfluidic devices provide the means produce complex multiple emulsions. By taking advantage of well-defined channels and flow parameters, monodisperse multiple emulsions can be made that can later be converted into synthetic polymer vesicles, or polymersomes. These polymersomes can be used for flavor protection, drug delivery, or protein storage. This dissertation presents a new robust capillary microfluidic device that utilizes a polymer scaffold and fully interchangeable parts that make it extremely versatile for any parameter that an experiment dictates. The flow regimes in the device are characterized by analyzing drop size and the encapsulation profiles are investigated. Double emulsions encapsulating single or multiple droplets are produced and subsequently dialyzed into polymersomes with great levels of control. The emulsion-stabilizing ability of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is studied by analysis of the expulsion rates of the inner drop from the double emulsion. By observing double emulsions sinking through a column of water as well as suspended on a stationary pedestal, the stability and expulsion rates could be determined while the double emulsions continued to dialyze. It is shown that even by increasing the viscosity of the organic phase or better matching the densities of the organic and aqueous phases, the absence of PVA renders the double emulsions far less stable. Graphene oxide (GO) is used as a solid surfactant to stabilize a styrene-in- water emulsion system to template the suspension polymerization of polystyrene particles. The effect of GO concentration and mixing time on the sphere size is analyzed, and it is shown that only the available amount of surfactant, and not the emulsification process, will dictate the final particle size. The importance of divinylbenzene (DVB) as a crosslinker in the suspension polymerization is also studied, elucidating its effect in stabilizing the emulsion by quickly increasing the viscosity and maintaining a spherical morphology in the mixture. Lastly, chemical and physical modifications are performed on the GO and the subsequent effects on the emulsification ability and suspension polymerization products are investigated. GO sheets are functionalized with trimethylsilyl (TMS) groups and analyzed by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). By making the surface of the GO sheets hydrophobic, a phase-inversion is generated in the emulsion system. Subsequent polymerization of the styrene phase produces a porous solid composite rather than a GO-coated polystyrene powder. Lastly, a single batch of GO is fractionated according to degree of oxidation, and it is shown that the graphitic character dictates the shape of the emulsion droplets and subsequently the polystyrene particles that are produced...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to better understand the formation, stability and properties of emulsions having lipid nanoparticles with tunable functional properties by controlling the composition and structure of the biopolymer interface, in order to develop better food-grade delivery systems. ^ Initially, the influence of environmental stresses (pH, heating and salts) on the physicochemical properties of cationic lactoferrin (LF) -stabilized oil-in-water emulsions was investigated. At ambient temperature, the emulsions were found to be stable at all times except when pH was close to pI. When LF-coated droplets were heated in distilled water, and then their pH was adjusted in the range 2 to 9, they were highly unstable to aggregation at pH 7 and 8. These results have important implications for the formulation and production of emulsion-based products using lactoferrin as an emulsifier. ^ Next, we studied the properties and stability of multilayer emulsions formed using the primary emulsifier lactoferrin and secondary polysaccharides like low methoxyl pectin (LMP), high methoxyl pectin (HMP) and alginate. At neutral pH, electrostatic attractions occurred between the anionic groups on the polysaccharide molecules and the cationic patches on the protein surfaces. In the absence of polysaccharide, the LF-coated droplets were highly unstable to aggregation when heated above about 60 ºC at pH 7, presumably because thermal denaturation of the adsorbed proteins increased droplet attraction. ^ Changes in the physicochemical properties and digestibility of both the primary LF and the secondary LF-polysaccharide emulsions, under simulated gastrointestinal conditions were monitored. The presence of a dietary fiber coating around the initial lipid droplets had little influence on the total extent of lipid digestion in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF), but LF-alginate emulsions had a slower initial digestion rate than the <b>other</b> <b>emulsions.</b> These results suggest that the dietary fiber coatings may become detached in the small intestine, or that they were permeable to digestive enzymes. Pepsin was found to have little influence on the physical stability or digestibility of the emulsions. ^ Next, we fabricated emulsions with oil droplets coated by sequential electrostatic deposition of cationic LF and anionic β-lactoglobulin (BLG) at pH 6. 5 : LF, LF-BLG, LF-BLG-LF, and LF-BLG-LF-BLG. Changes in the physicochemical properties of these systems were characterized when they were exposed to environmental stresses and simulated small intestine conditions. LF-coated droplets were stable throughout the entire pH range which was attributed to strong steric repulsion. All the nanolaminated droplets were unstable to aggregation at pH 5, which is between the isoelectric points of BLG and LF. ^ Finally, a 2 ̆ 2 premix 2 ̆ 2 approach was utilized to fabricate interfacial coatings around the lipid droplets, instead of the LbL approach. This method involved mixing BLG and LF prior to emulsion formation and the influence of environmental stresses on the properties of these emulsions was examined. Droplets coated by BLG were unstable to aggregation near their isoelectric point (pH 2 ̆ 6 ap; 5), whereas those coated by LF were stable across the whole pH range. The stability of emulsions to pH induced aggregation improved as the ratio of LF-to-BLG in the mixed systems was increased. Lipid droplets coated by either LF or BLG were unstable to aggregation at high salt concentrations (500 mM NaCl, pH 6. 5), but those stabilized by mixed protein coatings (LF and BLG) were stable, which was attributed to an increase in interfacial thickness and steric repulsion. Droplets coated by BLG were stable to droplet aggregation after thermal treatment (30 to 90 oC, 0 mM, NaCl pH 7), whereas those coated by LF were highly unstable when heated above their thermal denaturation temperature. The thermal stability of the droplets decreased as the amount of LF in the mixed systems increased. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E

40|$|The emulsion, {{which is}} a {{heterogeneous}} system, consisting {{of at least one}} immiscible liquid intimately dispersed in another in the form of droplets, is widely used in the fields of foods, pharmaceutics, cosmetics and various chemical industries. Several studies on the emulsion state, the stability of dispersed particles, the emulsification etc. have been made by many investigators. These results, however, are difficult to apply for the emulsions used in the above industrial fields, in which many kinds of organophilic substances or emulsifiers are used, since they give only some phenomenological interpretations. The purpose of this work is to obtain practically significant informations on the dispersion state of either oil-in-water type or water-in-oil type emulsion by studying mainly the rheological properties of the systems of various combinations of emulsifiers and oil components such as ionic or nonionic emulsifiers, saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and fatty alcohols. I. Effects of emulsifiers on flow properties of oil-in-water emulsions. Viscosities of the system of anionic emulsifier does not depend on the rate of shear at dispersion concentrations below 40 vol. %. The system of nonionic emulsifier shows non-Newtonian flow over the range of dispersion concentrations at relatively low rate of shear. At higher shear rate, however, flow of the system of nonionic emulsifier tends to show Newtonian behaviour and the values of relative viscosities of the system agree with those of the system of anionic emulsifier at the same dispersion concentrations. These difference in flow behaviour of two systems may be attributed to the difference in the dispersion state, which is remarkably influenced {{by the nature of the}} surface layer on the dispersed particle. The emulsion particles in the system of anionic emulsifier, whose surfaces are negatively charged by the ionized groups of emulsifier molecules, repel each other. On the other hand, the particles in the system of nonionic emulsifier, whose surfaces are surrounded by the hydrophilic molecules, can not repel each other and will form larger aggregates without losing their identity. II. Detection of solubilizate of dispersed liquid in oil-in-water emulsions. It may be expected from the studies of Lawrence and his school for the system of soap solution with amphiphiles, that a certain amount of dispersed liquid of emulsion is solubilized by the emulsifier existing in the dispersion medium. Gas chromatographic, nephelometric and viscometric measurements were used for inspecting the existence of solubilizate of dispersed liquid in the dispersion medium. The emulsions studied were composed of n-hexane, 1 -octanol or mixture of equal volume of both liquids in water, stabilized by anionic or nonionic emulsifiers, respectively. Dispersion media for measurements were separated from these emulsions by the fractionation of lower part of the emulsions after standing fifty days at 32 ℃. Existence of the solubilizates in the dispersion medium has been confirmed, the amount of which depends on the nature of the dispersed liquid and emulsifier, and also on the concentration of the emulsifier at constant temperature. The transparency and viscosity of the dispersion medium are influenced by the nature of the dispersed liquids and emulsifiers used for the preparation of the emulsions, as those of ordinary solubilized systems. III. Influence of polar component of dispersed liquids on dispersion state of oil-in-water emulsions. Viscosity, particle size and "creaming" volume of emulsions of n-hexane, 1 -cotanol or mixture of both liquids in water, stabilized by various emulsifiers, were compared with each <b>other.</b> <b>Emulsions</b> of n-hexane in water are relatively monodisperse and their viscosities increase with increasing amount of n-hexane in a usual manner. Emulsions of the mixture of n-hexane and 1 -octanol or 1 -octanol alone in water have higher viscosity, smaller particle size and larger "creaming" volume than the n-hexane in water emulsions in all dispersion concentrations studied. In the latter emulsions which contained 1 -octanol in the dispersed liquids, viscosity and "creaming" volume depend on the nature of the emulsifier, and are sensitive to the concentration of the emulsifier. The difference in dispersion state of emulsions stated above may be attributed to the difference in polarity between 1 -octanol and n-hexane in the dispersed liquids. IV. Viscosity and particle size of oil-in-water emulsions of dispersed liquids. Viscosity and particle size have been measured for the emulsions of saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons and fatty alcohols stabilized with anionic emulsifier. It has been observed that the viscosity increased and the particle size decreased with dispersed liquid in the following order; saturated hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, 1 -pentanol, 1 -hexanol, 1 -heptanol, 1 -octanol and 1 -decanol. The phenomena appear to be interpreted in terms of difference of the interaction between the emulsifiers and the dispersed substances. The various factors affecting the emulsion viscosity, such as particle size distribution, viscosity of suspending fluid or formation of aggregate between dispersed particles, are also discussed. V. The effect of suspending fluids on relative viscosity of water-in-oil emulsions. The relative viscosity of water-in-oil emulsions, stabilized by sorbitan monostearate, was found to be influenced by the species of suspending fluids. The fluids tested include n-hexane, cyclohexane, decalin, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, toluene, xylene and tetralin. The dependence of both relative viscosity and sedimentation volume of the dispersed particles upon the concentrations of emulsifier are also influenced by the suspending fluids at a constant dispersion concentration. The results can be explained in terms of the difference in aggregated states of water droplets in each suspending fluid, which is present at various concentrations of emulsifier. VI. Rheological studies of concentrated oil-in-water emulsion. The rheological behaviour of the concentrated oil-in-water emulsion in the state of so-called "cream," has been investigated by the measurements of responses in the range of low frequency, yield value under the slight deformation and the steady-flow viscosity. The concentration in weight percent of the components of system was as follows: water, 56; liquid paraffin, 35; Arlacel 169, 1; cetylalcohol, 1; Arlacel 60, 2; Tween 60, 5. The emulsion was prepared by mixing these components at 80 ℃, where spontaneous emulsification occurs, and its rate of cooling from the mixed temperature to 25 ℃ was 4, 3, 1, 0. 3, 0. 2 and 0. 1 degrees per minute, respectively. This procedure gave six types of samples. Samples prepared at a slow rate of cooling (below 1 degrees per minutes) were already in the state of "cream" at the end of the cooling procedure, and their viscoelasticity and yield value increased with the aging time. From these results, and also from the nature of the change in the steady-flow viscosity with aging, the state of "cream" may be considered to be brought about by the formation of both thixotropic gel structure and the irreversible binding between dispersed particles. On the other hand, the samples prepared at a fast rate of cooling (above 3 degrees per minutes) showed low stiffness and no change in their rheological properties with the aging time. VII. Particle-size determination of suspensions or emulsions by viscometry. An apparatus for sedimentation analysis by the viscometric method, making possible the measurement of viscosity change with time at a fixed position in the bulk due to the sedimentation or ascension of dispersed particles, has been constructed. The new method has been examined with both a potato-starch-granule suspension and oil-in-water emulsions. It is concluded that the aggregated state of dispersed particles in the bulk of emulsions, consisting of both macroscopic droplets and solubilized micells in all the cases studied, are not only affected by the kind of emulsifiers, but also by the nature of oil phase through the interaction between the emulsifiers and the polar groups or π-electrons in the components. In view of more practical use, the emulsion in the state of so-called "cream" has been investigated by the method of mechanical responses, and it has been found that "cream" is brought about by the formation of both thixotropic gel structure and the irreversible binding between dispersed particles. A new method of particle-size determination for the dispersed systems by the viscometry has also been proposed...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: To {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that lipid emulsions with different triglyceride structures have distinct immunomodulatory properties, we analyzed human neutrophil adhesion and degranulation after lipid incubation. METHODS: Neutrophils, isolated from the blood of 10 healthy volunteers, were incubated in medium or physiologic (2. 5 mmol/L) emulsions containing long-chain (LCT), medium-chain (MCT), mixed LCT/MCT, or structured (SL) triglycerides. Expression of adhesion molecules and degranulation markers was evaluated by flow cytometry. Also, functional adhesion was investigated {{by means of a}} flow cytometric assay using fluorescent beads coated with the integrin ligand intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1. RESULTS: Although LCT and SL had no effect, LCT/MCT significantly increased expression of the beta 2 integrins lymphocyte-function-associated antigen 1 (+ 18 %), macrophage antigen 1 (+ 387 %), p 150, 95 (+ 82 %), and (alphaDbeta 2 (+ 230 %). Degranulation marker expression for azurophilic (CD 63, + 210 %) and specific granules (CD 66 b, + 370 %) also significantly increased, whereas L-selectin (CD 62 L, - 70 %) decreased. The effects of LCT/MCT were mimicked by the MCT emulsion. ICAM- 1 adhesion (% beads bound) was increased by LCT/MCT (34 % +/- 4 %), whereas LCT (19 % +/- 3 %) and SL (20 % +/- 2 %) had no effect compared with medium (17 % +/- 3 %). CONCLUSIONS: LCT/MCT and MCT, contrary to LCT and SL emulsions, increased neutrophil beta 2 integrin expression, adhesion, and degranulation. Apart from <b>other</b> <b>emulsion</b> constituents, triglyceride chain length might therefore be a key feature in the interaction of lipid emulsions and the phagocyte immune syste...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCombustion {{characteristics}} of an ethanol-in-decane emulsion droplet and a droplet group under puffing conditions {{have been investigated}} by direct numerical simulation (DNS). Before puffing, a quasi-steady flame is formed {{in the wake of}} the parent decane droplet. Due to superheating, boiling of ethanol sub-droplets is initiated. Following rapid growth of the vapor bubble, ethanol vapor is unsteadily ejected out and interacts with the downstream wake flame. The local gas mixture fraction is affected by this ejection. The gas-phase temperature and reaction rate also show different characteristics from those of a 1 D steady flame. In the dual-fuel system, fuel/air mixing in combustion can be characterized by the scalar dissipation rates (SDRs) due to mixing of decane/air and ethanol/air and cross mixing of decane/ethanol. The transient interaction between the droplet wake flame and the ejected vapor by puffing is evident in the flame S-curves. The interaction is further quantified by the budget analysis in the mixture fraction – SDR space. The contribution of the cross SDR between decane and ethanol to the rate of change of the SDR of the primary fuel decane is initially negative, which is particular to puffing. Later the cross SDR can also become positive. As the mixing continues, the magnitude of the SDRs becomes smaller. When puffing occurs in the transverse direction, the ejected vapor may sweep a region within a few diameters away from the parent decane droplet. If <b>other</b> <b>emulsion</b> droplets are in this region of influence, inter-droplet interactions occur. A multiple-droplet case demonstrates this interaction and implies that such an interaction will occur in an emulsion fuel spray and should be considered in modeling a multi-component emulsion fuel spray in a combustor...|$|R

40|$|There are {{numerous}} review papers discussing liquid nanoemulsions {{and how they}} compare to <b>other</b> <b>emulsion</b> systems. Little research is available on dried nanoemulsions. The objectives of this research were to (i) study the effect of varying the continuous phase of nanoemulsions with different carbohydrate/protein ratios on subsequent emulsion stability, and (ii) compare the physicochemical properties, lactose crystallisation properties, microstructure, and lipid oxidation of spray dried nanoemulsions compared to spray dried conventional emulsions having different water and sugar contents. Nanoemulsions containing sunflower oil (10 % w/w), β-casein (2. 5 – 10 % w/w) and lactose or trehalose (10 – 17. 5 %) were produced following optimisation of the continuous phase by maximising and minimising viscosity and glass transition temperature (Tg’) using mixture design software. Increasing levels of β-casein from caused {{a significant increase in}} viscosity, particle size, and nanoemulsion stability, while resulting in a decrease in Tg’. Powders were made from spray drying emulsions/nanoemulsions consisting of lactose or a 70 : 30 mixture of lactose:sucrose (23. 9 %), sodium caseinate (5. 1 %) and sunflower oil (11. 5 %) in water. Nanoemulsions, produced by microfluidisation (100 MPa), had higher stability and lower viscosity than control emulsions (homogenization at 17 MPa) with lower solvent extractable free fat in the resulting powder. Partial replacement of lactose with sucrose decreased Tg and delayed Tcr. DVS and PLM showed that in powdered nanoemulsions, lactose crystallises faster than in powdered conventional emulsions. Microstructure of both powders (CLSM and cryo-SEM) showed different FGS in powders and different structure post lactose crystallisation. Powdered nanoemulsions had lower pentanal and hexanal (indicators of lipid oxidation) after 24 months storage due to their lower free fat and porosity, measured using a validated GC HS-SPME method, This research has shown the effect of altering the continuous phase of nanoemulsions on microstructure of spray dried nanoemulsions, which affects physical properties, sugar crystallisation, and lipid oxidation...|$|R

40|$|Myeloid leucosis and erythroleucosis can be {{transmitted}} from one bird to <b>others</b> by <b>emulsions</b> of infiltrated organs, whole blood cells, and plasma. Inoculation is more often successful with blood cells or with whole blood than with plasma or with emulsions of organs infiltrated {{as the result of}} leucosis. Inoculation with material from a bird with myeloid or with erythroleucosis produces both myeloid and erythroleucosis, and in many instances mixed forms with characters of both. Evidence is wanting that lymphoid leucosis is caused by the agent that transmits myeloid and erythroleucosis. The occurrence of lymphoid leucosis among the birds inoculated with material from myeloid or erythroleucosis may be explained as spontaneous disease. Injury to cellular structure by treatment with distilled water or by repeated freezing and thawing does not destroy the agent that transmits the disease. Berkefeld filtrates have failed to transmit regularly myeloid or erythroleucosis.

40|$|In situ {{combustion}} of a {{water-in-oil emulsion}} layer supported on {{water is a}} complex process. In this paper, the combustion process of water-in-oil emulsion layers floating {{on top of a}} water body, {{as in the case of}} in situ burning of oil spilled at sea that has turned into emulsion, is modeled by using comprehensive mathematical treatment, and the results are compared with data obtained in our lab. The burning process model is divided into three regimes, as follows: 1. The initial regime begins when the emulsion layer floating on the ocean surface receives heat flux from an external source, such as an igniter or a burning oil pool; 2. The intermediate regime begins from the instant of the first appearance of an oil layer on the top of the emulsion layer due to breaking of the emulsion and continues until the oil starts to evaporate; 3. The final regime begins with the combustion of oil vapor, and ends when the fire extinguishes. The laboratory tests were conducted: 1) to establish a critical (i. e., minimum) external heat flux value to cause self-sustaining combustion of the emulsion layer for various emulsion compositions, and 2) to generate burn rate and <b>other</b> <b>emulsion</b> pool fire characteristics, such as time for emulsion separation, burn rate, burn time, and residue volume left. Measurements were made for emulsions of commercial no. 2 diesel oil, having 20 % to 80 % water by volume. The model was solved numerically by using finite difference method.

40|$|We {{report on}} the effect of fullerenes (C- 60) on the {{stability}} of nanostructured lipid emulsions. These (oil-in-water) emulsions are essentially aqueous dispersions of lipid particles exhibiting self-assembled nanostructures at their cores. The majority of previous studies on fullerenes were focused on planar and spherical lipid bilayer systems including pure lipids and liposomes. In this work, fullerenes were interacted with a lipid that forms nanostructured dispersions of non-lamellar self-assemblies. A range of parameters including the composition of emulsions and sonication parameters were examined to determine the influence of fullerenes on in-situ and pre-stabilized lipid emulsions. We found that fullerenes mutually stabilize very low concentrations of lipid molecules, while <b>other</b> concentration <b>emulsions</b> struggle to stay stable or even to form at first instance; we provide hypotheses to support these observations. Interestingly though, we were able to encapsulate varying amounts of fullerenes in sterically stabilized emulsions. This step has a significant positive impact, as we could effectively control an inherent aggregation tendency of fullerenes in aqueous environments. These novel hybrid nanomaterials may open a range of avenues for biotechnological and biomedical applications exploiting properties of both lipid and fullerene nanostructures. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the formulation and characterisation of emulsion explosives. This included the manufacture of more than 120 kg of emulsion explosive of which around 105 kg was used on the explosive ordnance range in over 350 individual firings. For each emulsion composition, an average of eight firings was undertaken with which to substantiate the explosive performance data. The formulation was varied {{to determine the effects}} of water content upon the physical characteristics of the emulsion. These physical effects included thermal conductivity, particle size, viscosity and the explosive performance of the emulsion. In respect of explosive performance, microballoons were added to sensitise the emulsion and the proportions of microballoons added were altered to look at their effect on velocity of detonation, sensitivity and the brisance of the emulsions. Emulsion explosives are commonly referred, in literature, as Type 11 non-ideal explosives. This is due to their non-linear behaviour with respect to the variation of velocity of detonation with density. Traditionally, when an emulsion explosive was commercially manufactured, the water content has been kept at a minimum (12 - 17 %). This was accepted as the way to achieve the best explosive performance, based upon the belief that an emulsion with the highest concentration of active ingredients, ammonium nitrate and oil, would give the best explosive performance. This study examined a wider range of emulsion explosive water contents than has been previously studied, from 12 % to 35 % water. It was found, during this study, that higher water content emulsions, specifically 25 % water, had a marked increase in explosive performance. The highest velocity of detonation recorded was in a 39 mm diameter tube, at 25 % water content with 3 % microballoons, was 5558 ms- 1. This was some 15 % higher than any other VOD recorded in this study. The high velocity of detonation, at 25 % water content, was one of a number of physical characteristics in which this water content varied from the <b>other</b> <b>emulsion</b> water contents. This study endeavored to show that emulsion explosives could exhibit two differing types of explosive reaction, thermal explosion and grain burning. This was based on the velocity of detonation and plate dent data, both of which indicated that there was a change in reaction with water content. Emulsion explosives, with a high water and high microballoon content, exhibited a thermal explosion type reaction. They exhibited Type I ideal explosive behaviour, with increasing velocity of detonation with density. Lower water content emulsion explosives, displayed the more commonly expected Type 11 non-ideal behaviour and reacted in a grain burning type detonation.
