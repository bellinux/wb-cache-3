40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology for quantifying the expected benefits of maintenance improvement initiatives using statistical techniques. Multivariable regression models {{are used to}} correlate monthly equipment maintenance costs with monthly planned and unplanned downtime. The models permit the expected cost savings for an equipment fleet to be quantified {{as a function of}} the percentage reduction in unplanned maintenance downtime likely to result from an improvement initiative. The models also make it possible to quantify expected increases in fleet availability and reliability and to calculate cost factors that indicate how much more expensive it is on average to apply unplanned as opposed to planned maintenance strategies. A case study is presented that demonstrates how the methodology was applied to the mobile equipment fleets in an <b>openpit</b> copper <b>mine</b> in Northern Chile...|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} Thesis is {{to examine}} how the rock mass and intact rock {{properties}} influence the excavatability of rock in surface mine. One {{of the most important}} decisions in the design of surface mine is the selection of mine equipment and plant. Now that increasing effort is being invested in the design and manufacture of continuous surface miners it is appropriate to examine how their performance can be related to the physical properties of the rock mass and intact rock. Over the years many {{attempts have been made to}} develop a means of assessing the excavatability of rock. Most of them are based on an empirical rating system whilst some authorities still propose the use of seismic velocity as a direct predictor of the rippability of a rock mass. On the other hand there are a number of classical models which have been developed to define the cutting force required at the pick or tooth of continuous miners. Whilst these methods have been applied with various degrees of success to the design of excavation systems there is no generally acceptable method of defining the excavatability or cuttability of a rock mass in terms of the machine power required to generate a particular rate of production. An attempt is made to overcome this deficiency by recording the intact and rock mass properties at Limestone quarry in Retznei, Austria; <b>Openpit</b> Gold <b>Mines</b> in Meekatharra and Mt Gibson of Western Australia and <b>Openpit</b> Coal <b>Mine</b> in Air Laya, Indonesia, where VASM- 2 D and Bucket Wheel Excavator O&K SchRs(800 / 1. 2) 15 or O&K S 630 were in use in the first mine sites and Air Laya respectively to use this data to examine the relationships between the relevant dimensionless groups developed from a dimensional analysis of the problem. The dimensionless groups are obtained by examining the factors which influence the productivity of a surface miner. These include intact rock and rock ++mass properties, and machine power required for a particular rate of production and lead to the development of dimensionless groups namely, Rock Cuttability Index (RCI), Rock Mass Factor (RMF), Brittleness Index (BI), Rock Excavatability Index. The monitoring of machine power was carried out at Mt. Gibson and Air Laya mines. As a part of this study, field seismic tests were carried out at Mt. Gibson and Air Laya with the intention of seeking the most appropriate method of this type of test and analysis for excavation purposes. The test results indicate that borehole tests are the most promising and the output of seismic velocity obtained from a built-in program seismograph needs further thorough examination. The analysis of field data at all the sites proved that the most appropriate measure of discontinuities in the rock mass is the mean distance between discontinuities in a direction parallel to the cutting direction of the machine. Since the lateritic rock mass is different to other ordinary rock masses, a modified RMR is proposed. This is done by adjusting classification criteria on spacing and condition of discontinuity. The results proved that the discontinuity spacing obtained from the proposed method warrants wide application of the power cutting model developed. The RMR, Q-System and Excavatability Index are used to assess the performance of the continuous surface miners investigated. The results indicated that the Excavatability Index is the most acceptable criterion for the excavatability assessment. The outcome of this research has confirmed the significance of the RCI as a predictor of cutting performance of mechanical machines. The relationship between the RCI and REI can be used to good effect in analysing the performance of operating machines. A good example of this is given in the analysis of the performance of the BWE at the Mae Moh mine in Thailand...|$|R
40|$|Resuspended street dust is {{a source}} of inhalable {{particles}} in urban environments. Despite contaminated street dust being a possible health risk factor for local population, {{little is known about the}} contribution of atmospheric dust emissions and other factors to the content of toxic metals in street dust. The impact of smelting, traffic, and power plants on metal contaminates in street dust is the focus of street dust sampling at 46 locations in the Witbank area (Republic of South Africa). This area is characterized by numerous <b>openpit</b> coal <b>mines</b> in the Karoo coal basin, which provides a cheap source of energy to numerous metallurgical smelters and ironworks and supplies coal to the coal-fired power plants located nearby. Street dustwas collected on asphalt or concrete surfaces with hard plastic brushes, avoiding collecting of possible sand, soil, or plant particles. Chemical analysis was done on the < 0. 125 mm fraction using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry subsequent to total digestion. Exceptionally high concentrations of metals were detected with concentrations of Fe reaching 17. 7 %, Cr 4. 3 %, Mn 2 %, Ni 366 mg/kg, and V 4, 410 mg/kg. Factor analysis indicates three sources for the pollution. Road traffic which contributes to the high concentrations of Cu, Pb, Sb, and Sn, with the highest impacts detected in the town of Witbank. The second source is associated with the metal smelting industry, contributing to Fe, Co, Mn, and Vemissions. The highest factor scores were observed around four metallurgical smelter operations, located in the Ferrobank, Highveld, and Clewer industrial areas. Impact of vanadium smelter to street dust composition could still be detected some 20 km away from the sources. Exceptionally high concentrations of Cr were observed in four samples collected next to the Ferrobank industrial area, despite Cr not being loaded in factor 2. The last source of the pollution is most probably fly ash associated with the coal-fired power plants and fly ash dumps. Elements which are associated with this source are Al, Sr, and Li. This factor is abundant in the coal mining part of the study area. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|Climate change {{captured}} {{my interest}} {{as a teenager}} when, at the dining table, my dad talked about potential anthropogenic climate changes. He brought up subjects such as “climate could change if the Siberian Rivers were to be deviated to the South for irrigation of the (semi) arid areas of the former Soviet Union”. Other subjects were afforestation in the Sahel to enhance precipitation recycling, deforestation in the Tropics that could have worldwide impacts on climate, the local climate impacts of the Merowe High Dam in its vicinity and downstream, Atlantropa, a new ice age, {{and the increase in}} days with sunshine after the introduction of the high-chimney policy in the Rhein-Ruhr area, just to mention a few. Various investigations from different, independent researchers showed evidence for climate change at various spatial and temporal scales. The causes of climate change are manifold. They range from astronomical changes, changes in the distribution of continents including mountain ranges and heights, volcanic eruptions, evolution of the biosphere, to anthropogenic impacts, among many others. Anthropogenic impacts encompass, but are not limited to, emission of greenhouse gases (e. g., water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, ozone) as well as trace gases that are precursors for aerosols, land-cover changes for food production, grazing, hunting, wood harvesting, housing, recreation, water storage, and transportation, as well as <b>openpit</b> <b>mining,</b> oil and gas drilling. Even emission-control measures, to protect human health, may impact the local, and potentially regional, climate as aerosol-precursor concentrations, and particle concentrations and their composition may change. Teleconnections can propagate regional change signals to areas far downwind of the initial changes. This means climate change needs no passport or visa to enter another country. We are all in it together. A habitable, reachable planet is hard to find. Thus, just the idea that the activity of humankind may impact the climate of our “spaceship” Earth can be frightening, even terrifying, and may cause stress. As with handling any other stress, it is important to stay cool. Doing so enables researchers to gather the facts (knowledge, data), think, build hypotheses and test them, identify gaps in the knowledge, think about what data one would need to close these gaps, build new hypotheses, gather further data and/or develop and improve models to test the hypotheses, and so on. Scientific data-based knowledge is critical for understanding natural and anthropogenic impacts on climate, feedback mechanisms between various processes and components of the Earth system, sensitivities, uncertainties, and the magnitude of various natural and anthropogenic impacts. Such understanding and knowledge are urgent needs for cost-effective and ethical decisions for all living beings on Earth, and a growing world population with its growing water, food, and energy demands. Being aware that climate change has always happened, humankind cannot afford to split into groups that are not willing and/or even not able to talk to each other. Humankind cannot afford that their scientists waste their time on being captivated by interest groups, and petty discussions for/about funding, and lose the freedom of research. Scientific debate is fruitful, necessary and will always exist. Recall when physicists disputed about the wave and particle structure of electro-magnetic waves, or the validity of the general theory of relativity. In the end, it turned out both times that both arguments were right. The discrepancies were due to the experimental design and the point they were coming from. Most likely climate science is at the dawn of something similarly exciting. In the interest of freedom of research and progress in climate research, we should not ask to which group a scientist and/or his/her research “belongs”. Instead, we, as the climate science community, have to ask questions like: Why do we get results that have to be interpreted in one or the other way? Did we, by accident, capture a special case such as mechanics within the relativity theory? Are we overlooking something? What impacts have closing/installing of observational sites and improved measurements for knowledge about the climates of the globe? Can we demonstrate that Earth system models, climate models or even very simple models are able to capture past observations? Which opportunities have we overlooked and tools do we have available that could advance climate research? For instance, a great, often overlooked, capability of models is that they can be used to learn/examine what is important when, and where. If the same hypothesis is once rejected based on a dataset used, and once accepted based on another dataset, the logical next step is to compare the two datasets, and to investigate the reasons. Is one or are both datasets biased and/or contaminated by changes in the instrumentation, the measurement protocol, or in the environment other than climate change? What different information do the two datasets hold that led to the different answers? Can we find other data to figure out whether we are dealing with a special case? Are we overlooking a process that only becomes important under certain circumstances? Are we facing something similar to the UV-catastrophe in the Rayleigh-Jeans law? Climate wants to be a forum to stimulate such questions, ideas, and discussions. This article is available at www. mdpi. com/journal/climat...|$|R
