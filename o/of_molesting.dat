25|$|In 2013, in {{a lawsuit}} against our church, a woman accused my husband and three others <b>of</b> <b>molesting</b> her twenty-five years earlier. She didn’t {{remember}} the alleged “abuses” before her thirties, and then believed she was recovering lost memories.

Montgomery County police investigated and filed no charges. After eighteen months, an independent investigator concluded her accusations likely never happened.

The musician was subsequently indicted on four counts <b>of</b> <b>molesting</b> a minor, four counts of intoxicating a minor, one count of abduction, and one count of conspiring to hold the boy and his family captive at Neverland Ranch. During the five-month trial, Jackson faced allegations of child molestation and assertions that he had attempted to abduct the Arvizo family in a hot air balloon. He denied all the charges and family members proclaimed that he was the victim of an extortion attempt. One friend, Firpo Carr, expressed amazement at the allegations leveled against the singer, who at the time was living at Neverland Ranch. [...] "I'm surprised they haven't accused him of bestiality because he also has a zoo there. I mean, it gets ridiculous after a while." [...] On June 13, 2005, the jury found Jackson not guilty on all charges.|$|E
