25|$|Another most {{important}} {{property of the}} heterostyly system is physiological. If thrum pollen is placed on a thrum stigma, or pin pollen on a pin stigma, the reproductive cells are incompatible and relatively little seed is set. Effectively, this ensures <b>out-crossing,</b> as described by Darwin. Quite a lot is now known about the underlying genetics; the system is controlled {{by a set of}} closely linked genes which act as a single unit, a super-gene. All sections of the genus Primula have heterostyle species, altogether 354 species out of 419. Since heterostyly is characteristic of nearly all races or species, the system is at least as old as the genus.|$|E
500|$|The {{sea anemone}} Aiptasia diaphana {{displays}} sexual plasticity. Thus asexually produced clones derived form a single founder individual can contain {{both male and}} female individuals (ramets). [...] When eggs and sperm (gametes) are formed, they can produce zygotes derived from “selfing” (within the founding clone) or <b>out-crossing,</b> that then develop into swimming planula larvae. Anemones tend to grow and reproduce relatively slowly, the magnificent sea anemone (Heteractis magnifica) for example, may live for hundreds of years, with one individual surviving in captivity for eighty years.|$|E
2500|$|Ruderfer et al. (2006) {{analyzed}} the ancestry of natural S. cerevisiae strains {{and concluded that}} outcrossing occurs only about once every 50,000 cell divisions.

[...] Ruderfer et al. pointed out that such contacts are frequent between closely related yeast cells for two reasons. [...] The first is that cells of opposite mating type are present {{together in the same}} ascus, the sac that contains the cells directly produced by a single meiosis, and these cells can mate with each other. [...] The second reason is that haploid cells of one mating type, upon cell division, often produce cells of the opposite mating type with which they can mate.

40|$|Laboratory {{choice and}} no-choice cross-mating tests were {{conducted}} to establish whether Trissolcus basalis individuals from green vegetable bug, Nezara viridula, and nine other host species share mating characteristics and {{belong to the same}} species. In no-choice cross-mating tests, all individuals in self- and <b>out-crosses</b> mated within 10 minutes. Although all females mated, they were not all inseminated successfully. However, a similar proportion of females was inseminated across all self- and <b>out-crosses</b> in each set of cross-mating tests.

40|$|Abstract Sex {{determination}} in fishes {{is often}} enigmatic, {{a situation that}} is often made even more complex {{by the fact that the}} process of sexual differentiation in many species may be influenced by environmental conditions. This situation is typified in zebrafish, a popular model organism. Despite the vast array of information available for the species, the genetic controls of sex are unknown. Further, environmental param-eters, such as rearing densities, seem to exert an influence on the sex ratios of captive stocks. In an effort to dissect the genetic and environmental controls underlying the expression of sex in this species, we manipulated growth of pure-bred and <b>out-crossed</b> zebrafish by varying their food supply during development. Faster-growing zebrafish were more likely to be female than siblings that were fed less, and <b>out-crossed</b> broods had higher proportions of females than broods from pure-bred crosses. The dependence of sex ratio on feeding rate is readily understood in terms of adaptive sex allocation: zebrafish life history seems to confer the greater pay-off for large size on females. A similar male/female difference in the pay-off for hybrid vigor could similarly account for the female bias of <b>out-crossed</b> broods—and it could be a manifestation of Haldane’s rule...|$|R

50|$|Another {{adaptive}} {{feature for}} the blowout penstemon plant is the lifespan of the seeds.

This infusion also added several benefits to the overall makeup of the Red-Tiger Bulldog which eliminated poor respiratory system problems that had been prominent in many other bulldog breeds.|$|R
50|$|Bromus tectorum is {{an annual}} bunchgrass, usually germinating in autumn, {{overwintering}} as a seedling, then flowering {{in the spring}} or early summer. If winter rainfall is limiting and spring moisture is adequate, the seeds will germinate in the spring, and the plants will flower that summer. It typically reaches 40 - 90 cm tall, though plants as small as 2.5 cm may produce seed. It is cleistogamous and self-fertile, with no evident <b>out-crossing.</b>|$|E
50|$|Self-fertilization {{results in}} the loss of genetic {{variation}} within an individual (offspring), because many of the genetic loci that were heterozygous become homozygous. This can result in the expression of harmful recessive alleles, which can have serious consequences for the individual. The effects are most extreme when self-fertilization occurs in organisms that are usually <b>out-crossing.</b> After several generations, inbreeding depression is likely to purge the deleterious alleles from the population because the individuals carrying them have mostly died or failed to reproduce.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the general}} POC model, {{reduction}} of brood size - if caused by POC - should depend on genetic relatedness between offspring in a fruit. Indeed, abortion of embryos {{is more common in}} <b>out-crossing</b> than in self-pollinating plants (seeds in cross-pollinating plants are less related than in self-pollinating plants). Moreover, the level of solicitation of resources by the offspring is also increased in cross-pollinating plants: There are several reports that the average weight of crossed seeds is greater than of seeds produced by self-fertilization.|$|E
40|$|Campsis radicans is an {{attractive}} climber with typical ornitogamous flowers, native to North America. In natural conditions this <b>out-crossed</b> plant is pollinated mostly by hummingbirds. In Poland, where C. radicans is cultivated as ornamental, it rarely sets seeds. The questions addressed {{in the present study}} were: (1) What animals pollinate its flowers in Poland?, and (2) What is the reason for infrequent fruit set? Field studies conducted in five localities in Poland showed that the principal pollinator is Apis mellifera, and the lack of seeds is usually caused by pollinator limitation or absence of genetically different pollen donor plants...|$|R
40|$|No {{data are}} {{available}} on pollen flow distances for wind-pollinated canopy trees in broad-leaf, closed, evergreen forests. Nevertheless, major biogeographic patterns, such as the relative absence of anemophilic tree species in lowland tropical forests {{and the rise of}} the angiosperms, have been explained in terms of the supposed relative inefficiency of anemophily compared to zoophily. In this study, fruits were found below females of the dioecious anemophilous tree species Podocarpus falcatus in the Knysna Forest, which were up to 70 m from male trees. This pollen flow is over more than twice the distance previously suggested as a maximum and indicates that wind-pollinated species could produce <b>out-crossed</b> progeny in species-rich communities...|$|R

50|$|The haploid fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a facultative sexual {{microorganism}} {{that can}} undergo mating when nutrients are limiting. Exposure of S. pombe to hydrogen peroxide, an agent that causes oxidative stress leading to oxidative DNA damage, strongly induces mating {{and the formation}} of meiotic spores. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae reproduces by mitosis as diploid cells when nutrients are abundant, but when starved, this yeast undergoes meiosis to form haploid spores. Haploid cells may then reproduce asexually by mitosis. Katz Ezov et al. presented evidence that in natural S. cerevisiae populations clonal reproduction and selfing (in the form of intratetrad mating) predominate. In nature, mating of haploid cells to form diploid cells is most often between members of the same clonal population and <b>out-crossing</b> is uncommon. Analysis of the ancestry of natural S. cerevisiae strains led to the conclusion that <b>out-crossing</b> occurs only about once every 50,000 cell divisions. These observations suggest that the possible long-term benefits of outcrossing (e.g. generation of diversity) are likely to be insufficient for generally maintaining sex {{from one generation to the}} next. Rather, a short-term benefit, such as recombinational repair during meiosis, may be the key to the maintenance of sex in S. cerevisiae.|$|E

Here, we report the results of crosses in which inbred lines were <b>out-crossed</b> to wild-type animals in an attempt to identify dominant, codominant, or incompletely dominant modifiers of allorecognition. A claim for the existence of modifiers unlinked to ARC was rejected for three different genetic backgrounds. Estimates of the genetic map distance of ARC in two wild-type haplotypes differed markedly from one another and from that measured in congenic lines. These results suggest that additional allodeterminants exist in the Hydractinia ARC...|$|R

40|$|Coconut palms are {{classified}} into two major types, viz., ‘talls’ and ‘dwarfs’, which mainly {{differ in their}} pollination behavior of cross- and self-pollination, respectively. Due to this difference, getting true-to-type progenies of desirable tall and dwarf cultivars {{has always been a}} challenge. The conventional practice of selection of seedlings based solely on morphological traits often results in selection of <b>out-crossed</b> seedlings and undesirable off-types. In the present investigation, RAPD markers for the tall/dwarf trait were identified in coconut using a bulked DNA approach. Screening of tall and dwarf palm bulk DNA with 200 primers revealed a RAPD primer OPBA 3 which was able to clearly differentiate both the tall and dwarf bulks. For validation, the primer was used to screen individual tall and dwarf coconut palms representing different geographic regions. The primer was also used to screen the parents and validate hybrids of Dwarf x Tall crosses. ...|$|R
