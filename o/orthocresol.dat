40|$|While {{studying}} the pharmacology of the isomeric {{phosphoric acid esters}} of the phenols {{in an attempt to}} explain the specific action of triorthocresyl phosphate 1 on the neuro-muscular appara-tus {{it was found that the}} phosphorous acid ester of <b>orthocresol</b> produced in the cat an unusual neurological syndrome charac-terized by a condition of extensor rigidity of relatively long dura-tion (2). Histologically the neurotoxic effects of this compound were characterized by a combined system degeneration involving the tracts concerned with the mediation of the higher automatic reflexes. In particular the degeneration was almost exclusively confined to the lateral and antero-lateral columns of the spinal cord, and the tracts primarily involved were the afferent spino cerebellar and the efferent mesencephalic-pontine-cerebello-spinal. There was relatively little degeneration of the corticospinal tracts and no evidence of involvement of the primary afferent neuron. it thus appeared that the phosphoric and the phosphorous acid esters of <b>orthocresol</b> possessed similar specific neurotoxic prop-. erties, the one exerting its selective action chiefly upon the mye-lin substance of the conducting fiber of the primary or lower motor neuron, and the other upon the myelin substance of the conduct-ing fibers of the second afferent as well as of the lower efferent neurons including those which have their origin in the mesen-cephalon, pons and upper medulla (3). Since the characteristic action of triorthocresyl phosphate on the lower motor neuron could not be reproduced in the lower animals with the phosphoric 1 The compound responsible for the outbreak of multiple neuritis in 1930 - 1931, and commonly referred to as “ginger ” paralysis (1) ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Silica filled {{epoxy resins}} as {{encapsulation}} in chip packages reveal {{a major influence}} on the reliability and functionality of microelectronic devices. In this study, the resulting effects of post-mold curing (PMC) on the thermomechanical and chemical properties of different mold compounds were observed. Polymer systems of the investigated mold compounds were based on two <b>orthocresol</b> novolacs (OCN), one biphenyl and one multifunctional resin (MFR). It could be shown, that longer thermal treatment after curing leads in general to further cross-linking of the polymer chains and increases the glass transition temperature Tg. Therefore, the temperature resistance of the mold for following process steps after package assembling, like soldering, can be improved as well as the reliability during temperature cycle tests. However, PMC treatment also increases the moisture absorption. Here, MFR mold exhibit the highest moisture absorption. Also the high Tg of the MFR mold is not much influenced by PMC. Hence, further thermal treatment after curing of the MFR mold is not necessary. In case of OCN and biphenyl mold types, the advantages of PMC are predominating...|$|E
40|$|It is {{not known}} whether urinary {{excretion}} of hippuric acid (HA) or <b>orthocresol</b> (O-Cr) is to be preferred for the biological monitoring of workers with occupational exposure to toluene. To study this, 42 printing trade workers with more than 10 years' exposure to a mixture of organic solvents including toluene (0 - 20 ppm) and 43 control subjects matched by age, smoking habits, and living accommodation were investigated. Each matched pair was randomised to an experimental exposure of either 100 ppm or 0 ppm toluene for 6. 5 hours under controlled conditions in an exposure chamber. Urinary excretion of HA and O-Cr was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography from samples obtained before exposure, {{during the first three}} hours, and during the last 3. 5 hours of exposure. No difference in HA and O-Cr excretion was found between printing trade workers and controls. The median O-Cr excretion increased 29 times during exposure, whereas the HA excretion increased only five times. Thus only 3 % of the O-Cr excretion originated from other sources than toluene whereas the corresponding value for HA was 19 %. Standardisation of the concentrations of HA and O-Cr in relation to urinary creatinine reduced the relative variation by 29 % and 56 % respectively. This was not reduced further by expressing the excretions as average excretion rates based on total volume of urine collected. Background urinary O-Cr excretion was three to four times higher among smokers than non-smokers, probably due to the content of O-Cr in cigarettes. The O-Cr excretion in unexposed smokers was, however, 10 times lower that that of the non-smokers during the end of the experimental exposure to 100 ppm toluene...|$|E
