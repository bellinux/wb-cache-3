5|$|Often in {{part because}} of the threat of hurricanes, many coastal regions had sparse {{population}} between major ports until the advent of automobile tourism; therefore, the most severe portions of hurricanes striking the coast may have gone unmeasured in some instances. The combined effects of ship destruction and remote landfall severely limit the number of intense hurricanes in the <b>official</b> <b>record</b> before the era of hurricane reconnaissance aircraft and satellite meteorology. Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect.|$|E

5|$|These active {{hurricane}} seasons predated satellite {{coverage of}} the Atlantic basin. Before the satellite era began in 1960, tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one, a ship reported a voyage through the storm, or a storm landed in a populated area. The <b>official</b> <b>record,</b> therefore, could miss storms in which no ship experienced gale-force winds, recognized it as a tropical storm (as opposed to a high-latitude extra-tropical cyclone, a tropical wave, or a brief squall), returned to port, and reported the experience.|$|E
5|$|What the {{transfer}} really did was {{ensure that the}} files would {{be placed in the}} CIA's operational records, a records system that—due to the 1986 CIA Operational Files exemption—is not subject to the FOIA and is a black hole for anyone trying to access the files within. The move prevents the public from accessing the <b>official</b> <b>record</b> about the raid, and bypasses several important federal records keeping procedures in the process.|$|E
5|$|According to the <b>official</b> <b>record</b> (read by Thomas Arundel, {{archbishop}} of Canterbury, during an assembly of lords and commons at Westminster Hall on Tuesday 30 September), Richard {{gave up his}} crown willingly and ratified his deposition citing as a reason his own unworthiness as a monarch. On the other hand, the Traison et Mort Chronicle suggests otherwise. It describes a meeting between Richard and Henry that took place one day before the parliament's session. The king succumbed to blind rage, ordered his release from the Tower, called his cousin a traitor, demanded to see his wife and swore revenge throwing down his bonnet, while the duke refused to do anything without parliamentary approval.|$|E

5|$|In its 2007 expose , the {{political}} weekly Tehelka released hidden camera footage of {{several members of}} the Bharatiya Janata Party, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal admitting their role in the riots. While the report was criticised for being politically motivated, some newspapers said the revelations simply reinforced what was common knowledge. Several inaccuracies in the statements cast doubt on the sting operation. Bajrangi and Suresh Richard said that Narendra Modi visited Naroda Patiya a day after the massacre to thank them, but the <b>official</b> <b>record</b> shows that Modi did not visit Naroda Patiya. The Gujarat government blocked cable news channels from broadcasting the expose, an action which was criticised by the Editors Guild of India.|$|E
5|$|Nicol {{made his}} major league debut for the Browns on September 23, 1890, {{starting}} the {{game against the}} Philadelphia Athletics {{that resulted in a}} 21–2 win. He did not allow a single hit to the Athletics through seven innings, after which the game was called off due to darkness. Although the game was previously considered a no-hitter, a rule change made by the MLB's Committee on Statistical Accuracy in 1991 redefined the definition of a no-hitter; a no-hit game now had to span a minimum of nine innings. As a result, Nicol's debut was one of fifty no-hitters deleted from the <b>official</b> <b>record</b> books.|$|E

It began a weakening trend on November2 while taking a wavering path across the north Atlantic Ocean. On November4, the cyclone started a general east-southeast motion, passing near the southwest coasts of Ireland and Great Britain. It made landfall on the Cotentin Peninsula of France on November6 and dissipated, although one proposed track, which is a modified track that differs from the <b>official</b> <b>record</b> due to new evidence or theory, was given by Charles Mitchell that showed the cyclone executing a counter-clockwise loop over northwest France until dissipating the storm on November8.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of the season finales, fights on The Ultimate Fighter are sanctioned by the Nevada Athletic Commission as exhibition matches and do not count for or against a fighter's professional record. This is done to keep the results from going public before the air date. However, going into the semi-final stage of each series, fights are scheduled for the full professional three rounds, as opposed to two rounds (with the possibility of a sudden victory round) for all stages prior. Though officially exhibition fights, the UFC chooses to record the results of semi-final matchups. For example, the seventh season winner Amir Sadollah has one more win on his UFC record than on his <b>official</b> <b>record</b> due to his victory in his season's semi-final round.|$|E
5|$|Charles Spencer Chaplin {{was born}} on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (born Hannah Harriet Pedlingham Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr. There is no <b>official</b> <b>record</b> of his birth, {{although}} Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London. His mother and father had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr. became the legal carer of Hannah's illegitimate son, Sydney John Hill. At {{the time of his}} birth, Chaplin's parents were both music hall entertainers. Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker, had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley, while Charles Sr., a butcher's son, was a popular singer. Although they never divorced, Chaplin's parents were estranged by around 1891. The following year, Hannah gave birth to a third son – George Wheeler Dryden – fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden. The child was taken by Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter Chaplin's life for 30 years.|$|E

5|$|In {{medieval times}} the {{township}} {{was within the}} manor of Castlerigg and Derwentwater. The earliest surviving <b>official</b> <b>record</b> of the town is the market charter of 1276 granted to {{the lord of the}} manor, Thomas de Derwentwater. The manor was granted by Alice de Romilly to Adam de Derwentwater before 1216, and subsequently passed to the Radclyffe family through marriage. The Derwentwater estate was forfeit to the Crown after the execution of James Radclyffe, third Earl of Derwentwater, in 1716 for his part in the Jacobite rebellion the previous year. In 1735 the Crown granted the income from the estates to support the Greenwich Hospital, London. Land to the south and west were part of Greenwich Hospital's forestry and farming estates until the 19th century. In 1925 the then owner, Sir John Randles, gave the National Trust 90 acres of land in this estate, including the foreshore woodland.|$|E

Although the record shows a distinct increase in the number and strength of intense hurricanes, therefore, experts regard the early data as suspect. Christopher Landsea et al. estimated an undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 and zero to four per year between 1886 and 1910. These undercounts roughly take into account the typical size of tropical cyclones, the density of shipping tracks over the Atlantic basin, and the amount of populated coastline.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is the <b>official</b> <b>record</b> chart in the United Kingdom. In the 1970s, it was {{compiled}} weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) {{on behalf of}} the British record industry with a one-week break each Christmas. Prior to 1969 many music papers compiled their own sales charts but, on 15 February 1969, the BMRB was commissioned in a joint venture by the BBC and Record Retailer to compile the chart. BMRB compiled the first chart from postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops. The sampling cost approximately £52,000 and shops were randomly chosen and submitted figures for sales taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. The data {{was compiled}} on Monday and given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Record Retailer (rebranded Music Week in 1972). However, the BMRB often struggled to have the full sample of sales figures returned by post. The 1971 postal strike meant that data had to be collected by telephone but this was deemed inadequate for a national chart, and by 1973 the BMRB was using motorcycle couriers to collect sales figures.|$|E
