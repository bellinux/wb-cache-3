We produce a catalogue of sources found by SCUBA- 2, and separate these into starless cores and protostars. We determine masses and densities for each of our sources, using source temperatures determined by the Herschel Gould Belt Survey. We compare the properties of starless cores in four different molecular clouds: L 1147 / 58, L 1172 / 74, L 1251 and L 1228. We find that the core mass functions for each region typically show shallower-than Salpeter behaviour. We find that L 1147 / 58 and L 1228 have a high ratio of starless cores to Class II protostars, while L 1251 and L 1174 have a low ratio, consistent with the latter regions being more active sites of current star formation, while the former are forming stars less actively.

Our goals are {{to study the}} YSO population of these cores and to measure the mid-infrared extinction law. With our combined near-infrared and Spitzer photometry, we classify each source in the cores as, among other things, background stars, galaxies, or embedded young stellar objects (YSOs). L 1152 contains three YSOs and L 1228 has seven, but neither L 204 C- 2 nor L 1155 C- 2 appear to contain any YSOs. We estimate an upper limit of 7 × 10 − 5 to 5 × 10 − 4 L ⊙ for any undiscovered YSOs in <b>our</b> <b>cores.</b> We also compute the line-of-sight extinction law towards each background star. These measurements are averaged spatially, to create χ 2 maps {{of the changes in}} the mid-infrared extinction law throughout <b>our</b> <b>cores,</b> and also in different ranges of extinction. From the χ 2 maps we identify two small regions in L 1152 and L 1228 where the outflows in those cores appear to be destroying the larger dust grains, thus altering the extinction law in those regions. On average, however, our extinction law is relatively flat from 3. 6 to 24 µm for all ranges of extinction and in all four cores. From 3. 6 to 8 µm this law is consistent with a dust model that includes larger dust grains than the diffuse interstellar medium, which suggests grain growth has occurred in <b>our</b> <b>cores.</b> At 24 µm, our extinction law is 2 − 4 × higher than predicted by dust models. However, it is similar to other empirical measurements. Subject headings: dust, extinction—ISM: globules—stars: formation 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} first search for {{spinning}} dust emission from {{a sample of}} 34 Galactic cold cores, performed using the CARMA interferometer. For each of <b>our</b> <b>cores</b> we use photometric data from the Herschel Space Observatory to constrain N_{H}, T_{d}, n_{H}, and G_{ 0 }. By computing {{the mass of the}} cores and comparing it to the Bonnor-Ebert mass, we determined that 29 of the 34 cores are gravitationally unstable and undergoing collapse. In fact, we found that 6 cores are associated with at least one young stellar object, suggestive of their proto-stellar nature. By investigating the physical conditions within each core, we can shed light on the cm emission revealed (or not) by our CARMA observations. Indeed, we find that only 3 of <b>our</b> <b>cores</b> have any significant detectable cm emission. Using a spinning dust model, we predict the expected level of spinning dust emission in each core and find that for all 34 cores, the predicted level of emission is larger than the observed cm emission constrained by the CARMA observations. Moreover, even in the cores for which we do detect cm emission, we cannot, at this stage, discriminate between free-free emission from young stellar objects and spinning dust emission. We emphasise that, although the CARMA observations described in this analysis place important constraints on the presence of spinning dust in cold, dense environments, the source sample targeted by these observations is not statistically representative of the entire population of Galactic cores.
