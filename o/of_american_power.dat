5|$|Political realism {{formed the}} basis of Kennan's work as a diplomat and {{historian}} and remains relevant to the debate over American foreign policy, which since the 19th century has been characterized by a shift from the Founding Fathers' realist school to the idealistic or Wilsonian school of international relations. According to the realist tradition, security is based on the principle of a balance of power, whereas Wilsonianism (considered impractical by realists) relies on morality as the sole determining factor in statecraft. According to the Wilsonians the spread of democracy abroad as a foreign policy is important and morals are valid universally. During the Presidency of Bill Clinton, American diplomacy represented the Wilsonian school {{to such a degree that}} those in favor of the realism likened President Clinton's policies to social work. According to Kennan, whose concept of American diplomacy was based on the realist approach, such moralism without regard to the realities of power and the national interest is self-defeating and will result in the decrease <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the Mellin {{transform}} method for the valuation <b>of</b> the <b>American</b> <b>power</b> put option with non-dividend and dividend yields, respectively. We use the Mellin transform method to derive the integral representations {{for the price}} and the free boundary <b>of</b> the <b>American</b> <b>power</b> put option. We also extend our results to derive the free boundary and the fundamental analytic valuation formula for perpetual <b>American</b> <b>power</b> put option which has no expiry date. Numerical experiments {{have shown that the}} Mellin transform method is a better alternative technique com-pared to the binomial model (BSM), recursive method (RM) and finite difference method (FDM) for the valuation <b>of</b> the <b>American</b> <b>power</b> put option. In general, the Mellin transform method is accurate, flexible and produces accurate prices for the optimal exercise boundary <b>of</b> the <b>American</b> <b>power</b> put option {{for a wide range of}} parameters. Hence the Mellin transform method is mutually consistent and agrees with the values of the analytic option valuation formula called the “Black-Scholes model”...|$|R

25|$|When a given {{nation or}} empire has {{achieved}} regional hegemony, its currency {{has been a}} basis for international trade, and hence for a de facto monetary system. In the West – Europe and the Middle East – an early such coin was the Persian daric. This was succeeded by Roman currency of the Roman empire, such as the denarius, then the Gold Dinar of the Ottoman Empire, and later – from the 16th to 20th centuries, during the Age of Imperialism – by the currency of European colonial powers: the Spanish dollar, the Dutch Gilder, the French Franc and the British Pound Sterling; at times one currency has been pre-eminent, at times no one dominated. With the growth <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>power,</b> the US Dollar {{became the basis for}} the international monetary system, formalized in the Bretton Woods agreement that established the post–World War II monetary order, with fixed exchange rates of currencies to the dollar, and convertibility of the dollar into gold. Since the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system, culminating in the Nixon shock of 1971, ending convertibility, the US dollar has remained the de facto basis of the world monetary system, though no longer de jure, with various European currencies and the Japanese Yen being used. Since the formation of the Euro, the Euro has gained use as a reserve currency and a unit of transactions, though the dollar has remained the primary currency.|$|E
