5|$|In a 1998 review, {{primatologist}} Marc Godinot recognized Sivaladapidae as {{a separate}} family within the Adapiformes, and this classification has been followed since then. Several genera in addition to Indraloris and Sivaladapis are now allocated to Sivaladapidae, which is known from the Eocene through the Miocene of China, Thailand, Myanmar, India, and Pakistan. Sivaladapids are notable for including by far the youngest adapiforms; {{members of this group}} are <b>otherwise</b> <b>known</b> mostly from the Eocene, but several sivaladapids occurred during the Miocene.|$|E

5|$|LACM 149371 was {{described}} in 2004 by Francisco Goin and colleagues, who tentatively interpreted the tooth as a left last upper molar. Although they saw similarities with South American ungulates, some early rodents, and multituberculates, they believed the tooth was most likely of a gondwanathere. Among gondwanatheres—a small and poorly known group <b>otherwise</b> <b>known</b> from the Cretaceous through Eocene {{of some of the}} southern continents (Gondwana)—they thought the Cretaceous Argentinian Ferugliotherium to be the most similar.|$|E

Eilífr is <b>otherwise</b> <b>known</b> as a pagan skald, and this selection has been theorized as describing that, due to directly associating Christ with the well, Christ had taken over responsibility of providence or fate.|$|E

5|$|In 1842, Johannes Theodor Reinhardt {{proposed}} {{they were}} ground doves, based on studies of a dodo skull he had rediscovered {{in the royal}} Danish collection of Copenhagen. This view was met with ridicule, but later supported by Strickland and Melville, who suggested the common descent of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo in 1848, after dissecting the only known dodo specimen with soft tissue and comparing it with the few solitaire remains then available. Strickland stated that although not identical, these birds shared many distinguishing features in the leg bones, features which were <b>otherwise</b> <b>known</b> only in pigeons.|$|E

5|$|Tall spined {{vertebrae}} {{from the}} Early Cretaceous of England were once {{considered to be}} {{very similar to those}} of Acrocanthosaurus, and in 1988 Gregory S.

These bones were originally assigned to Altispinax, an English theropod <b>otherwise</b> <b>known</b> only from teeth, and this assignment led to at least one author proposing that Altispinax itself was a synonym of Acrocanthosaurus. These vertebrae were later assigned to the new genus Becklespinax, separate from both Acrocanthosaurus and Altispinax.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} (Anthus petrosus), or just rock pipit, is {{a species of}} small {{passerine}} bird that breeds in western Europe on rocky coasts.

There are three subspecies, of which only the Fennoscandian form is migratory, wintering in shoreline habitats further south in Europe. The Eurasian rock pipit is territorial {{at least in the}} breeding season, and year-round where it is resident. Males will sometimes enter an adjacent territory to assist the resident in repelling an intruder, behaviour only <b>otherwise</b> <b>known</b> from the African fiddler crab.|$|E
