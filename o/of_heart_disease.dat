40|$|Abstract The risk of {{cardiovascular}} events {{in patients with}} diabetes {{is similar to that}} of patients with previous history <b>of</b> ischaemic <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and the prevalence <b>of</b> ischaemic <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> complicating diabetic syndromes is growing rapidly. Management <b>of</b> ischaemic <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in diabetic patients remains a challenge. Therapeutic options include several antianginal agents, and mechanical removal of coronary obstructions by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and aorto-coronary by-pass surgery. Unfortunately, all treatments are less effective in diabetic patients than in nondiabetic patients. Direct modulation of cardiac metabolic alterations associated with the diabetic syndrome appears as a promising alternative for the management <b>of</b> ischaemic <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in diabetic patients. Results obtained in anginal patients with the metabolic agent trimetazidine are consistent with this hypothesis...|$|R

5|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} (CVD) are {{the most}} common cause of death globally as of 2008, accounting for 30% of deaths. Of these more than three quarters are a result of coronary artery disease and stroke. Risk factors include: smoking, being overweight, little exercise, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and poorly controlled diabetes, among others. Cardiovascular diseases frequently do not have symptoms or may cause chest pain or shortness of breath. Diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> is often done by the taking of a medical history, listening to the heart-sounds with a stethoscope, ECG, and ultrasound. Specialists who focus on diseases of the heart are called cardiologists, although many specialties of medicine may be involved in treatment.|$|E
