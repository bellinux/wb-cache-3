5|$|Nablus {{came under}} the rule of the Ottoman Empire in 1517, along with the whole of Palestine. The Ottomans divided Palestine into six sanjaqs ("districts"): Safad, Jenin, Jerusalem, Gaza, Ajlun and Nablus, all of which were part of Ottoman Syria. These five sanjaqs were subdistricts of the Vilayet of Damascus. Sanjaq Nablus was further {{subdivided}} into five nahiya (subdistricts), in addition to the city itself. The Ottomans did not attempt to restructure the political configuration of the region <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>level</b> such that the borders of the nahiya were drawn to coincide with the historic strongholds of certain families. Nablus was only one among a number of local centers of power within Jabal Nablus, and its relations with the surrounding villages, such as Beita and Aqraba, were partially mediated by the rural-based chiefs of the nahiya. During the 16th century, the population was predominantly Muslim, with Jewish, Samaritan and Christian minorities.|$|E
5|$|The charismatic {{movement}} {{forced a}} reevaluation {{of what it}} was to be Pentecostal. The Assemblies of God understood Spirit baptism in the context of baptistic evangelical theology and, by the 1950s, emphasized certain doctrines and practices as requisite for Spirit baptism. Charismatics challenged these views by claiming to receive Holy Spirit baptism outside of this context (such as remaining in liturgical churches, failing to reject sacramental theologies, and not adopting Pentecostal taboos on dancing, drinking, smoking, etc.). <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>level,</b> Assemblies of God churches were influenced by the charismatic movement. Some charismatics left their original churches and joined less formal Assemblies of God congregations. In addition, the contemporary decreased emphasis on traditional Pentecostal taboos in the AG is in part attributable to the charismatic movement, which accelerated a trend already in existence.|$|E

However, if we normalise by the square of the mean stress, a representative measure of loading system stiffness can be obtained.

40|$|In Colombia, the {{coexistence}} {{of democracy and}} armed conflict {{is considered to be}} a paradox (Posada 2006).

In order to do that, I use municipal data from 2005 and, through an econometric analysis that includes spatial correlations, evaluate the impact of armed conflict on several health, education and basic sanitation indicators. The results show that armed conflict has affected the government effectiveness in providing such services. This leads one to think that, at least at <b>the</b> <b>local</b> <b>levels,</b> armed conflict would be putting at risk one of the basic principles of decentralization, the capacity to satisfy citizens’ needs through public service provision...|$|R

25|$|In 1897, a {{group of}} {{building}} trades unions from the Midwest formed the National Building Trades Council (NBTC) to adjudicate jurisdictional battles and encourage the amalgamation of construction and building unions.
