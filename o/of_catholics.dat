To destroy the Church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical statutes were inserted into the Constitution, beginning a 10-year persecution <b>of</b> <b>Catholics</b> {{that resulted in the}} deaths of thousands, including several priests who were also knights of Columbus.

5|$|Around 1570, of the {{at least}} 700 Protestant congregations in Poland-Lithuania, over 420 were Calvinist and over 140 Lutheran, {{with the latter}} {{including}} 30-40 ethnically Polish. Protestants encompassed approximately ½ of the magnate class, ¼ of other nobility and townspeople, and 1/20 of the non-Orthodox peasantry. The bulk of the Polish-speaking population had remained Catholic, but the proportion <b>of</b> <b>Catholics</b> became significantly diminished within the upper social ranks.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the support}} of al-Husayni, {{recruitment}} of Muslims for the division fell well short of the numbers needed. Himmler then allowed a 10 percent Christian component, but the recruitment of sufficient Muslims continued to prove difficult, resulting in the induction of 2,800 Catholic Croats into the division. To Himmler's dismay, this was greater than the ratio <b>of</b> <b>Catholics</b> to Muslims that he had wanted.|$|E

5|$|After the First Opium War, Hong Kong was ceded to the British in the Treaty of Nanking and {{the colony}} {{soon became a}} popular {{stopover}} for missionaries travelling onwards to China. The parish was established in 1842 by Theodore Joset, the first Prefect Apostolic of Hong Kong, and work began on a new and permanent church soon afterwards. The new church was located at the junction of Pottinger Street and Wellington Street. Construction was completed in 1843. Within the next few years, the number <b>of</b> <b>Catholics</b> in the parish grew significantly, {{partly due to the}} emigration of people from neighbouring Macau. The Portuguese colony was in gradual decline, and many people who resided there sought better opportunities in the young and prospering colony of Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|As the 19th century wore on non-conformist ministers {{increasingly}} {{began to}} conduct services within the workhouse, but Catholic priests were rarely welcomed. A variety of legislation {{had been introduced}} during the 17th century to limit the civil rights <b>of</b> <b>Catholics,</b> beginning with the Popish Recusants Act 1605 {{in the wake of}} the failed Gunpowder Plot that year. But although almost all restrictions on Catholics in England and Ireland were removed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829, a great deal of anti-Catholic feeling remained. Even in areas with large Catholic populations, such as Liverpool, the appointment of a Catholic chaplain was unthinkable. Some guardians went so far as to refuse Catholic priests entry to the workhouse.|$|E
5|$|Bachelot then {{traveled}} to California, {{where he served}} as an assistant minister while pastoring and teaching. In 1837, having learned of Queen Kaʻahumanu's death and King KamehamehaIII's willingness to allow Catholic priests on the island, Bachelot returned to Hawaii, intending to continue his missionary work. However, by Bachelot's arrival, KamehamehaIII had again {{changed his mind and}} Bachelot was removed from the island and confined to a ship for several months. He was freed only after the French and British navies imposed a naval blockade on the Honolulu harbor. Although he was later able to secure passage on a ship to Micronesia, he died en route and was buried on an islet near Pohnpei. His treatment in Hawaii prompted the government of France to dispatch a frigate to the island; the resulting intervention is known as the French Incident and led to the emancipation <b>of</b> <b>Catholics</b> in Hawaii.|$|E

In the last years of his life, Carroll attempted to regain some vestige of political power for Catholics in the colony, but the Protestant colonial assembly and Governor John Hart disfranchised them. His son, Charles Carroll of Annapolis, became a wealthy planter and his grandson, Charles Carroll of Carrollton, also wealthy, was the only Catholic signer of the United States Declaration of Independence.|$|E
