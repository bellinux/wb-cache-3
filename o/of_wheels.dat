5|$|The absence <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> {{in nature}} is {{frequently}} attributed to constraints imposed by biology: natural selection constrains the evolutionary paths available to species, and the {{processes by which}} multicellular organisms grow and develop may not permit {{the construction of a}} functioning wheel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{railway wheel}} in {{long-term}} running had experienced the wheel damage due to fatigue crack and shelling. The damaged wheel in railway vehicle {{would cause a}} poor ride comfort, {{a rise in the}} maintenance cost and even fracture <b>of</b> the <b>wheel,</b> which then leads to a tremendous social and economical cost. It is necessary to evaluate long-term damage <b>of</b> railway <b>wheel</b> in order to ensure the safety <b>of</b> <b>wheel.</b> To evaluate the damage for railway wheels, the measurements for the replication <b>of</b> <b>wheel</b> surface and residual stress <b>of</b> railway <b>wheel</b> using x-ray diffraction system were carried out. The result shows that the residual stress <b>of</b> <b>wheel</b> is depend on the running distance and thermal gradient during brake application also that the replication test can be applied in new evaluation method <b>of</b> <b>wheel</b> damage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper puts forward an {{intelligent}} single-plane biaxial balance monitor system, {{which is used}} in ultra-precision grinding. It adopts the method of single-plane balance correction for the vibration <b>of</b> <b>wheel</b> and workpiece. And this system {{can also be used}} for integral balance. For ultra-precision grinding, caused by the mutual influence of the vibration <b>of</b> <b>wheel</b> and workpiece, there will be a ripple on the workpiece surface, which is mainly influenced by the frequency ratio <b>of</b> <b>wheel</b> to workpiece, the feed rate and the vibration <b>of</b> <b>wheel</b> and workpiece. This system can improve the machining accuracy, reduce the surface error of workpiece and appraise the integrated machining result, by analyzing the vibration data <b>of</b> <b>wheel</b> and workpiece and adjusting machining parameters...|$|R

5|$|Within {{a week of}} Disneyland's {{opening on}} July 17, 1955, a {{brakeman}} pulled the switch connecting the Disneyland Railroad's main line with a siding at Main Street, U.S.A. Station too soon as the Retlaw 2 freight train on the siding was passing the Retlaw 1 passenger train stopped at the station on the main line. The caboose {{on the end of}} the freight train had not made it fully across the switch when it was pulled, and as a result the caboose's front set <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> correctly traveled along the siding while the rear set <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> incorrectly traveled along the main line towards the passenger train, causing the caboose to swing to the side before colliding with a concrete slab and derailing upon impact. During the ensuing commotion, the erring brakeman, presumably to avoid disciplinary action, quietly left the scene of the accident, exited the park, and was not seen again. No injuries were reported, and by the following year the use of sidings at stations on the DRR's main line came to an end.|$|E
5|$|In March 1941, 250 {{officers}} and men from No. 3 Commando {{took part in}} the first large-scale Commando raid, which was launched on four ports in the Lofoten Islands in Norway. The raid, codenamed Operation Claymore, proved to be a considerable success, resulting in the capture of a number <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> of the German Enigma encoding machine which helped the Allies to decode German radio traffic later in the war, as well as the destruction of a considerable amount of petrol and oil and the capture of several hundred Germans.|$|E
5|$|Rolling {{resistance}} {{is also the}} reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use <b>of</b> <b>wheels.</b> During {{the time of the}} Roman Empire, wheeled chariots were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to camels to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, asserting that, in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by oxen.|$|E

5|$|Wheels {{are prone}} to slipping—an {{inability}} to generate traction—on loose or slippery terrain. Slipping wastes energy and can potentially lead {{to a loss of}} control or becoming stuck, as with an automobile on mud or snow. This limitation <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> {{can be seen in the}} realm of human technology: in an example of biologically inspired engineering, legged vehicles find use in the logging industry, where they allow access to terrain too challenging for wheeled vehicles to navigate. Tracked vehicles suffer less from slipping than wheeled vehicles, owing to their larger contact area with the ground—but they tend to have larger turning radii than wheeled vehicles, and they are less efficient and more mechanically complex.|$|E
5|$|As the Mary Rose {{was built}} and served {{during a period}} of rapid {{development}} of heavy artillery, her armament was a mix of old designs and innovations. The heavy armament was a mix of older-type wrought iron and cast bronze guns, which differed considerably in size, range and design. The large iron guns were made up of staves or bars welded into cylinders and then reinforced by shrinking iron hoops and breech loaded, from the back, and equipped with simpler gun-carriages made from hollowed-out elm logs with only one pair <b>of</b> <b>wheels,</b> or without wheels entirely. The bronze guns were cast in one piece and rested on four-wheel carriages which were essentially the same as those used until the 19th century. The breech-loaders were cheaper to produce and both easier and faster to reload, but could take less powerful charges than cast bronze guns. Generally, the bronze guns used cast iron shot and were more suited to penetrate hull sides while the iron guns used stone shot that would shatter on impact and leave large, jagged holes, but both could also fire a variety of ammunition intended to destroy rigging and light structure or injure enemy personnel.|$|E
5|$|Many {{people had}} {{attempted}} to add tracks to moving machines. Over 100 patents had already been issued worldwide, but all failed to work in practical situations. In 1903 Benjamin Holt paid Alvin Lombard US$60,000 {{for the right to}} produce vehicles under Lombard's patent for the Lombard Steam Log Hauler. The center of innovation was in England, and in the same year Holt traveled to England to learn more about ongoing development. During that period, the chief engineer (and managing director) of Richard Hornsby & Sons in Grantham, England, David Roberts, was experimenting with a chain-track. Hornsby's design incorporated a steering clutch that varied the speed of each set <b>of</b> <b>wheels,</b> allowing the operator to turn the tractor by retarding one tread or the other. Roberts of Hornsby & Sons obtained a patent for their design in July 1904.|$|E

Furthermore, all driven wheels steer and, as pairing <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> is not necessary, vehicles with an odd number <b>of</b> <b>wheels</b> are possible without affecting the system's integrity.
