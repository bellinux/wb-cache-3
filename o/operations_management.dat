5|$|Management in all {{business}} and organizational activities is {{the act of}} getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives efficiently and effectively. Management comprises planning, organizing, staffing, leading or directing, and controlling an organization (a group {{of one or more}} people or entities), or effort for the purpose of accomplishing a goal. Resourcing encompasses the deployment and manipulation of human resources, financial resources, technological resources, and natural resources. Towards the end of the 20th century, business management came to consist of six separate branches, namely human resource management, <b>operations</b> <b>management</b> (or production management), strategic management, marketing management, financial management, and information technology management, which was responsible for management information systems. Although it is difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way, it helps in navigating the discipline of management. Design management overlaps mainly with the branches marketing management, <b>operations</b> <b>management,</b> and strategic management.|$|E

30|$|The {{successively}} increasing {{scale of}} urban rail transit lines {{gives rise to}} a shift from a quantitative to qualitative focus in <b>operation</b> <b>management.</b> As a result, conventional <b>operation</b> <b>management</b> methods cannot satisfy the needs of network <b>operation</b> <b>management.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to analyze and study system management methods and to take action from the viewpoint of urban development. This study systematically proposes the mechanisms of innovative network <b>operation</b> <b>management,</b> the creation of the management foundation of a network operation system and staff training, the planning, and preparation of network operation services with advanced capabilities, the strengthening of risk control and emergency system networks, the establishment of an evaluation system and a refined maintenance system to promote the operation of an equipment quality management network, the creation of a public relation crisis response system within the operation network, and improvements in the efficiency and level of <b>operation</b> <b>management</b> through the construction of an information-based operations system.|$|R

40|$|Microgrids (MGs) {{are local}} grids {{consisting}} of Distributed generators, energy storage systems and dispersed loads which may operate in both grid-connected and islanded modes. This paper aims {{to optimize the}} operation of a typical grid-connected MG which comprises a variety of DGs and storage devices {{in order to minimize}} both total operation cost and environmental impacts resulted from supplying local demands. Furthermore we will try to achieve an intelligent schedule to charge and discharge storage devices that provides the opportunity to benefit from market price fluctuations. The presented optimization framework is based on multiobjective modified shuffled frog leaping algorithm (MSFLA). To solve environmental/economic <b>operation</b> <b>management</b> (EEOM) problem using MSFLA, a new frog leaping rule, associated with a new strategy for frog distribution into memeplexes, is proposed to improve the local exploration and performance of the ordinary shuffled frog leaping algorithm. The proposed method is examined and tested on a grid-connected MG including fuel cell, wind turbine, photovoltaic, gas-fired microturbine, and battery energy storage devices. The simulation results for three scenarios involving the economic <b>operation</b> <b>management</b> of MG, environmental <b>operation</b> <b>management</b> of MG, and environmental/economic <b>operation</b> <b>management</b> of MG are presented separately. The obtained results compared with results of well-known methods reported in the literature and prove the efficiency of the proposed approach to solve the both single objective and multiobjective <b>operation</b> <b>management</b> of the MG...|$|R
