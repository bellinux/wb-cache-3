5|$|During ancient times, Gibraltar was {{regarded}} by {{the peoples of}} the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope <b>of</b> <b>securing</b> safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the central}} lines of {{cryptographic}} research is identifying the weakest assumptions required for the construction <b>of</b> <b>secure</b> primitives. In the context of group signatures the gap between what {{is known to be}} necessary (one-way functions) and what is known to be sufficient (trapdoor permutations) is quite large. In this paper, we provide the first step towards closing this gap by showing that the existence <b>of</b> <b>secure</b> group signature schemes implies the existence <b>of</b> <b>secure</b> publickey encryption schemes. Our result shows that the construction <b>of</b> <b>secure</b> group signature schemes based solely on the existence of one-way functions is unlikely. This is in contrast to what is known for standard signature schemes, which can be constructed from any one-way function...|$|R

5|$|After {{the liberation}} of most of Australian New Guinea the RAAF and RAN participated in the US-led Western New Guinea campaign, which had the goal <b>of</b> <b>securing</b> bases {{to be used to}} mount {{the liberation of}} the Philippines. Australian {{warships}} and the fighter, bomber and airfield construction squadrons of No.10Operational Group RAAF participated in the capture of Hollandia, Biak, Noemfoor and Morotai. After western New Guinea was secured No.10Operation Group was renamed the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF) and was used to protect the flank of the Allied advance by attacking Japanese positions in the NEI and performing other garrison tasks. The losses incurred whilst performing these relatively unimportant roles led to a decline in morale, and contributed to the 'Morotai Mutiny' in April 1945.|$|E
5|$|As a {{delegate}} to the 1856 Democratic National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, Breckinridge favored Pierce's re-nomination for president. When Pierce's hopes <b>of</b> <b>securing</b> the nomination faltered, Breckinridge joined other erstwhile Pierce backers by throwing his support behind his friend, Stephen Douglas. Even with this additional support, Douglas was still unable to garner {{a majority of the}} delegates' votes, and he withdrew, leaving James Buchanan as the Democratic nominee. William Alexander Richardson, a Kentucky-born Congressman from Illinois, then suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice-president would balance Buchanan's ticket and placate disgruntled supporters of Douglas or Pierce. A delegate from Louisiana placed his name before the convention, and although Breckinridge desired the nomination, he declined, citing his deference to fellow Kentuckian and former House Speaker Linn Boyd, who was supported by the Kentucky delegation.|$|E
40|$|Formal {{techniques}} {{have played a}} significant role in the study <b>of</b> <b>secure</b> communication in recent years. Specifically, there has been much research in developing process calculi, type systems, logics, and other foundations for the rigorous design and analysis <b>of</b> <b>secure</b> communication protocols. In comparison, the study <b>of</b> <b>secure</b> storage has received far less formal attention. Yet, over the years storage has assumed a pervasive role in modern computing. Now storage is a fundamental part of most networked computer systems that we rely on—and understanding secure storage is as important as understanding secure communication. One might wonder whether the foundations <b>of</b> <b>secure</b> communication already provide those <b>of</b> <b>secure</b> storage—after all, storage is a form of communication. Certainly it would be nice if techniques developed for the study <b>of</b> <b>secure</b> communication can also be applied to study secure storage. We propose to make these connections explicit. On the other hand, some distinctive features of storage pose problems for security that seem to go beyond those explored in the context of communication protocols. Perhaps the most striking of these features is access control. Indeed, storage systems typically feature access control on store operations, for various reasons that are informally linked with security. We see an intriguing and challenging research opportunity in understanding the foundations of access control for security in suc...|$|R

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{successful}} Bulgarian actions the Byzantines were no longer capable of taking the city with a direct assault. They also could not exhaust the defenders with hunger because, after their supplies were cut, the Byzantines themselves had to deal with that problem. In addition, an army led by Samuil marched into the mountains at the Byzantines' rear. In the meantime, instead <b>of</b> <b>securing</b> the way for retreat, Leon Melissenos pulled back to Plovdiv. That action was an additional reason for Basil II to lift the siege. The commander of the Western armies, Kontostephanos, persuaded him that Melissenos had set off to Constantinople to take his throne.|$|E
5|$|By 1995, the ARBiH and the HVO had {{developed}} into better-organised forces employing comparably {{large numbers of}} artillery pieces and good defensive fortifications. The VRS was not capable of penetrating their defences even where its forces employed sound military tactics, for instance in the Battle of Orašje in May and June 1995. In August 1995, {{after the fall of}} most of the Croatian Serb-controlled areas of Croatia during Operation Storm, the HV shifted its focus to western Bosnia. The shift was motivated by the desire to create a security zone along the Croatian border, establish Croatia as a regional power and gain favours with the West by forcing an end to the Bosnian War. The government of Bosnia and Herzegovina welcomed the move as it contributed to their goal <b>of</b> <b>securing</b> western Bosnia, as well as the largest Bosnian Serb-held city, Banja Luka.|$|E
