40|$|Background and objectives:Gamma-irradiation is used vastly {{for both}} {{decontamination}} and sterilization of natural products; but these high-energy rays can affect heat-sensitive essential oils. Methods: The oleo-gum-resin of Boswellia carterii (Burseraceae) was sterilized by γ-irradiation at dose 30 KGy. The essential oils obtained by hydrodistillation of non-irradiated Boswellia (NIB) and irradiated Boswellia (IB) {{were analyzed by}} GC/MS and the changes were compared. The structure of <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate</b> as the major component and marker of B. carterii was confirmed by MS/MS. Results: Twenty-five compounds comprising 99. 55 % of NIB oil and nineteen compounds comprising 98. 61 % of IB oil were identified. Major constituents which were common for both oils were <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (52. 67 % in NIB, 76. 51 % in IB), 1 -octanol (6. 37 % in NIB, 5. 19 % in IB), duva- 4, 8, 13 -triene- 1, 3 α diol (5. 52 % in NIB, 3. 94 % in IB), verticiol (13. 63 % in NIB) and verticillane type diterpene (5. 4 % in IB) they made up 78. 19 % and 91. 04 % of NIB and IB, respectively.

40|$|We {{measured}} detection thresholds for nasal pungency (in anosmics), odor (in normosmics) and {{eye irritation}} employing a homologous series of acetates: methyl through <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> decyl and dodecyl acetate. All anosmics reliably detected the series up to heptyl acetate. Only the anosmics without smell since birth (congenital) reliably detected <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> {{and only one}} congenital anosmic detected decyl and dodecyl acetate. Anosmics who lost smell from head trauma proved to be selectively less sensitive. As expected, odor thresholds lay well below pungency thresholds. Eye irritation thresholds for selected acetates came close to nasal pungency thresholds. All three types of thresholds decreased logarithmically with carbon chain length, as previously seen with homologous alcohols and as seen in narcotic and toxic phenomena. Results imply that nasal pungency for these stimuli rests upon a physical - rather than chemical - interaction with susceptible mucosal structures. When expressed as thermodynamic activity, nasal pungency thresholds remain remarkably constant within and across the homologous series of acetates and alcohols...|$|E

40|$|Using air-dilution olfactometry, we {{measured}} concentration-response functions for the odor detection of the homologous esters ethyl, butyl, hexyl, and <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> Stimuli were delivered {{by means of}} an 8 -station vapor delivery device (VDD- 8) specifically designed to capture odor detection performance by humans under environmentally realistic conditions. Groups of 16 - 17 (half female) normosmic (i. e., having a normal olfaction) non-smokers (ages 18 - 38) were tested intensively. The method involved a three-alternative forced-choice procedure against carbon-filtered air, with an ascending concentration approach. Delivered concentrations were confirmed by gas chromatography before and during actual testing. A sigmoid (logistic) model provided an excellent fit to the odor detection functions both at the group and individual levels. Odor detection thresholds (ODTs) (defined as the half-way point between chance and perfect detection) decreased from ethyl (245 ppb by volume), to butyl (4. 3 ppb), to hexyl acetate (2. 9 ppb), and increased for <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (20 ppb). Interindividual threshold variability was near one and always below two orders of magnitude. The steepness of the functions increased slightly but significantly with carbon chain length. The outcome showed that the present thresholds lie at the very low end of those previously reported, but share with them a similar relative trend across n-acetates. On this basis, we suggest that a recent quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for ODTs can be applied to these and additional optimized data, and used to describe and predict not just ODTs but the complete underlying psychometric odor functions...|$|E

40|$|Background The {{mosquito}} Anopheles funestus {{is one of}} {{the major}} malaria vector species in sub-Saharan Africa. Olfaction is essential in guiding mosquito behaviors. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are highly expressed in insect olfactory tissues and involved in the first step of odorant reception. An improved understanding of the function of malaria mosquito OBPs may contribute to identifying new attractants/repellents and assist in the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly mosquito controlling strategies. Methodology In this study, a large screening of over 50 ecologically significant odorant compounds led to the identification of 12 ligands that elicit significant electroantennographic (EAG) responses from An. funestus female antennae. To compare the absolute efficiency/potency of these chemicals, corrections were made for differences in volatility by determining the exact amount in a stimulus puff. Fourteen AfunOBP genes were cloned and their expression patterns were analyzed. AfunOBP 1, 3, 7, 20 and 66 showed olfactory tissue specificity by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that among olfactory-specific OBPs, AfunOBP 1 and 3 are the most enriched OBPs in female antennae. Binding assay experiments showed that at pH 7, AfunOBP 1 significantly binds to 2 -undecanone, nonyl acetate, <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and 1 -octen- 3 -ol but AfunOBP 3, which shares 68...|$|E
40|$|Using {{representative}} {{members of}} each of three homologous series of chemicals-ketones, acetates and alcohols-we measured nasal pungency thresholds in anosmics via two stimulus-delivery systems. The first system consists of the fairly commonly used 270 ml, plastic 'squeeze bottles'. The second system consists of 1900 ml, glass vessels with Teflon tubing and nose-pieces. Although bulkier and more susceptible to mechanical breakage, the glass vessels possess advantages that can allow them to provide 'environmentally realistic' chemosensory thresholds, i. e. thresholds closer in absolute values to those that might be obtained under whole-body exposures. Such advantages include a larger volume of the vapor-source to accommodate whole sniffs, and a tight nose-nose-piece connection to avoid stimulus dilution. The outcome revealed that, for every chemical, the glass vessels provided nasal pungency thresholds significantly lower than those provided by the squeeze bottles. The difference amounted, on average, to a factor of 4. 6, though the relative potency of the compounds remained the same under both systems. Additionally, when tested with the highest homologues used here, namely, <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and 1 -octanol, anosmics using the glass vessels {{had little or no}} difficulty achieving the criterion for threshold whereas they did have difficulty when using the squeeze bottles...|$|E
40|$|The {{apparent}} molar heat capacity, phi-c, its associative part, phi-c(assoc), and {{the excess}} heat capacity, C(p) E, {{have been obtained}} at 25 -degrees-C through the concentration range for methanol, hexan- 1 -ol and decan- 1 -ol {{in a series of}} proton acceptor solvents: methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> methyl octanoate, decyl acetate and methyl tetradecanoate. The results are explained quantitatively by the Tresczanowicz-Kehiaian (TK) association model and the Flory lattice model in terms of alcohol self-association into tetramers, characterized by an OH-OH equilibrium constant and enthalpy, and by alcohol-ester complex formation characterized by an OH-COO equilibrium constant and enthalpy, each independent of alcohol and ester chain length. As predicted, phi-c(assoc) at infinite alcohol dilution is independent of the choice of alcohol, but increases with increasing ester chain length. With increasing alcohol concentration phi-c(assoc) passes through a maximum which is much reduced compared with the inert solvent case. For each alcohol, C(p) E increases with increasing ester chain length, while for the same ester, C(p) E decreases with increasing alcohol chain length. dC(p) E/dT is positive for mixtures of methanol and methyl acetate, as predicted by the TK model. It is negative for decanol with methyl acetate, contrary to the TK model, but consistent with a non-random distribution of alcohol tetramers in the solution...|$|E

Defensive behaviors, as follows: a) attraction to scent source, b) elevation of wings in "V", c) abdomen elevation, d) abdomen elevation and pumping and e) first leg pair elevation had been temporarily registered when the following compounds were presented: isoamyl alcohol, octyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol, n-butyl acetate, n-octyl acetate, isopentyl acetate, benzyl acetate and 2 -heptanone. The results were as follows: 1. the bees elicited some characteristic behaviors when chemical alarm messages were presented, 2. agression (stinging) was not completed with any compound tested, probably {{because there was}} not a target (visual stimulus), 3. in all situations the attraction to scent source was low, 4. all the behaviors were elicited in a temporarily different way, 5. the compounds that elicited stronger responses and a greater number of the investigated behaviors were: isopentyl acetate, 2 -heptanone, <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and n-octyl alcohol. In all situations, the first behavior response (and the most intense one) was the elevation and pumping the abdomen.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between Depressaria pastinacella (parsnip webworm) and wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), in its native Europe {{and in its}} longstanding nonindigenous range in the midwestern United States, is characterized by chemical phenotype matching, ostensibly mediated by reciprocal selective responses. The first appearance of D. pastinacella on P. sativa in New Zealand in 2004 provided an opportunity to quantify selective impacts of a coevolved herbivore and calibrate rates of phytochemical response in its host plant. Webworms in 2006 reduced seed production up to 75 % in New Zealand populations, and in 2007 infestations increased in severity in all populations except one. Most New Zealand populations fall into a furanocoumarin phenotype cluster distinct from European and U. S. phenotypes, although one heavily attacked population clusters with two U. S. populations and one European population long associated with webworms. Multivariate selection analysis substituting realized fitness (with webworms present) for potential fitness (absent webworms) {{as the dependent variable}} revealed that reassociation with a coevolved specialist in a nonindigenous area profoundly altered the selection regime, favoring trait remixing and rapid chemical changes in parsnip populations, as predicted by the geographic mosaic theory. That uninfested populations of New Zealand parsnips contain higher amounts of <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> a floral volatile used by webworms for orientation, suggests that plants that escape from specialized enemies may also experience selection to increase kairomones, as well as to reduce allomones...|$|E

In {{order to understand}} the underlying processes leading to these orientations we stimulated single olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) through photo-activation within an intact neuronal network. Using the Gal 4 -UAS system two light inducible proteins, the light-sensitive cation channel channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR- 2) or the light-sensitive adenylyl cyclase (Pac α) were expressed in all or in individual ORNs of the larval olfactory system. Blue light stimulation caused an activation of these neurons, ultimately producing the illusion of an odor stimulus. Larvae were tested in a phototaxis assay for their orientation towards or away from the light source. Here we show that activation of Pacα expressing ORNs bearing the receptors Or 33 b or Or 45 a in blind norpA mutant larvae induces a repellent behavior away from the light. Conversely, photo-activation of the majority of ORNs induces attraction towards the light. Interestingly, in wild type larvae two ligands of Or 33 b and Or 45 a, <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and propionic ethylester, respectively, have been found to cause an escape reaction. Therefore, we combined light and odor stimulation to analyze the function of Or 33 b and Or 45 a expressing ORNs.

In disc method, methanol extract of Z. officinale (LC 50 = 28. 3134 µg/ml) showed the most activity in comparison with positive standard of potassium dichromate (LC 50 = 23. 2893 µg/ml); but in solution method, essential oil of H. persicum (LC 50 = 0. 0071 µl/ml) was the most active fraction in comparison with potassium dichromate (LC 50 = 27. 7528 µg/ml). Totally, among tested fractions, essential oil of the H. persicum has been exhibited the most cytotoxicity. The essential oil of H. persicum was analyzed by GC-MS.

40|$|Water {{stable and}} {{biodegradable}} nanofibers were successfully prepared by electrospinning {{of a combination}} of secondary aqueous dispersions of oligolactide (OLA) and a blockcopolyester. Stable aqueous dispersions of OLA up to 10 wt% loaded with the pheromone of Lobesia Botrana, the grapevine moth, were prepared using solvent displacement method. OLA was prepared by conventional polycondensation of lactic acid. The presence of OLA with hydrophilic alkoxy and carboxy end groups and pheromone as a secondary dispersion hydrophobe additive, succeeded in giving stable dispersions in water. Aqueous dispersion of a total hydrophobic content of up to 32 wt% was prepared applying the combination of solvent displacement method and osmosis. The average particle size of the dispersions was about 1 - 2 µm. No stable dispersions were possible without the pheromone or without the OLA. Replacement of the pheromone with classical hydrophobes used in miniemulsions for example hexadecane, hexadecanol (cetyl alcohol) did not yield stable dispersions. However, <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate</b> having structural analogy to the pheromone gave stable dispersions in water up to 10 wt%. This type of aqueous polyester formulation is highly effective in providing novel perspectives in applications such as controlled release of biomaterials like pheromone, in this case, and drugs. These could also be used for other processing techniques, for example, film preparation and coatings. Since such formulations completely eliminate the use of harmful organic solvents for processing, they can be highly effective for applications in the fields of medicine, pharmacy and agriculture...|$|E
40|$|The present {{investigation}} was aimed to analyse the chemical composition of essential oil isolated from Heracleum persicum Desf. ex Fischer and assess its lethal and sub-lethal effects against Tribolium castaneum (Herbst). Essential oil from hydro-distilled seeds of H. persicum was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and hexyl butyrate (50. 58 %), <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (9. 80 %) and hexyl hexanoate (8. 75 %) were found as principal constituents. Repellent activity, contact and fumigant toxicity and antifeedant {{effects of this}} oil were assessed against the adults of T. castaneum. The essential oil strongly repelled T. castaneum adults even at the lowest concentration (0. 035 μL cm - 2). Complete repellency (100 %) occurred when the highest concentration (0. 212 μL cm - 2) was applied for 8 h. T. castaneum was very susceptible to H. persicum oil at both contact and fumigant bioassays. In the fumigant toxicity, essential oil killed the larvae, pupae and adults and significantly decreased larvae emerged from treated eggs. LC 10 to LC 40 values of fumigation adult’s bioassay as sub-lethal concentrations were {{used to evaluate the}} antifeedant effects. H. persicum essential oil has significant antifeedant effects on T. castaneum adults and decrease of feeding happened when oil concentrations increased. The {{results of the present study}} indicate that essential oil of H. persicum, with wide bio-effects on T. castaneum, is a source of biologically active agents which may potentially prove to be efficient insecticides. </p...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{increasing}} interest in natural dietary and therapeutic preparations used as dietary supplements has been observed. One {{of them is}} frankincense. This traditional medicine of the East {{is believed to have}} anti-inflammatory, expectorant, antiseptic, and even anxiolytic and anti-neurotic effects. The present study aims to verify the reported therapeutic properties of Boswellia resin and describe its chemical composition based on available scientific studies. The main component of frankincense is oil (60 %). It contains mono- (13 %) and diterpenes (40 %) as well as ethyl acetate (21. 4 %), <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (13. 4 %) and methylanisole (7. 6 %). The highest biological activity among terpenes is characteristic of 11 -keto-ß-acetyl-beta-boswellic acid, acetyl- 11 -keto-ß-boswellic acid and acetyl-α-boswellic acid. Contemporary studies have shown that resin indeed has an analgesic, tranquilising and anti-bacterial effects. From {{the point of view of}} therapeutic properties, extracts from Boswellia serrata and Boswellia carterii are reported to be particularly useful. They reduce inflammatory conditions in the course of rheumatism by inhibiting leukocyte elastase and degrading glycosaminoglycans. Boswellia preparations inhibit 5 -lipoxygenase and prevent the release of leukotrienes, thus having an anti-inflammatory effect in ulcerative colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, bronchitis and sinusitis. Inhalation and consumption of Boswellia olibanum reduces the risk of asthma. In addition, boswellic acids have an antiproliferative effect on tumours. They inhibit proliferation of tumour cells of the leukaemia and glioblastoma subset. They have an anti-tumour effect since they inhibit topoisomerase I and II-alpha and stimulate programmed cell death (apoptosis) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Traditionally, the {{essential}} oil of aromatic herbs is obtained using hydrodistillation (HD). Because the emitted volatile fraction plays a fundamental {{role in a}} plant’s life, various novel techniques have been developed for its extraction from plants. Among these, headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) can be used to obtain a rapid fingerprint of a plant’s headspace. Daucus crinitus Desf. is a wild plant that grows along the west coast of Algeria. Only a single study has dealt with the chemical composition of the aerial part oils of Algerian D. crinitus, in which isochavicol isobutyrate (39. 0 %), <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (12. 3 %), and b-caryophyllene (5. 4 %) were identified. Using GC-RI and GC-MS analysis, {{the essential}} oils and the volatiles extracted from separated organs of D. crinitus Desf. were studied using HS-SPME. Results: GC-RI and GC-MS analysis identified 72 and 79 components in oils extracted using HD and in the volatile fractions extracted using SPME, respectively. Two types of essential oils were produced by the plant: the root oils had aliphatic compounds as the main component (87. 0 %- 90. 1 %), and the aerial part oils had phenylpropanoids as the main component (43. 1 %- 88. 6 %). HS-SPME analysis showed a more precise distribution of compounds in the organs studied: oxygenated aliphatic compounds were well represented in the roots (44. 3 %- 84. 0 %), hydrocarbon aliphatic compounds were in the leaves and stems (22. 2 %- 87. 9 %), and phenylpropanoids were in the flowers an...|$|E

The chlorinated phenols were {{treated in the}} PED reactor as an aerosol at a voltage of 55 – 60 kV, a frequency of 385 Hz, a current of 50 – 60, and with a 200 -ns pulse. As determined by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/MS), the first stage converted 500 ppm 2, 4, 5 -TCP to 163 ppm 2, 4, 5 -TCP and di-methyldecene, dichloronaphthalenol, <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> and silyl esters. The total carbon content of 2, 4, 5 -TCP after PED treatment {{was determined to be}} 228 35 ppm. The remaining 2, 4, 5 -TCP and the products formed were then mineralized by the acclimated activated sludge in shake flasks; the initial rate of degradation of 2, 4, 5 -TCP was calculated to be 5 nmol min) 1 mg protein) 1 at 163 ppm initial concentration (three orders of magnitude higher than the only rate found in the literature). By combining the two techniques, a synergistic eect (2. 3 -fold increase in the concentration of 2, 4, 5 -TCP degraded and 3. 3 -fold increase in total carbon degraded) was ob-served, in that bacteria without any treatment degraded a maximum of 70 ppm 2, 4, 5 -TCP but after PED treatment 163 ppm 2, 4, 5 -TCP was degraded. TeCP was also min-eralized by the acclimated activated sludge after treat-ment with PED. This two-stage approach was also evaluated using a continuous 1 -l fluidized-bed reactor...|$|E
40|$|Volatile aroma-active esters are {{responsible}} for the fruity character of fermented alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine. Esters are produced by fermenting yeast cells in an enzyme-catalyzed intracellular reaction. In order to investigate and compare the roles of the known Saccharomyces cerevisiae alcohol acetyltransferases, Atf 1 p, Atf 2 p and Lg-Atf 1 p, in volatile ester production, the respective genes were either deleted or overexpressed in a laboratory strain and a commercial brewing strain. Subsequently, the ester formation of the transformants was monitored by headspace gas chromatography and gas chromatography combined with mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). Analysis of the fermentation products confirmed that the expression levels of ATF 1 and ATF 2 greatly affect the production of ethyl acetate and isoamyl acetate. GC-MS analysis revealed that Atf 1 p and Atf 2 p are also responsible for the formation of a broad range of less volatile esters, such as propyl acetate, isobutyl acetate, pentyl acetate, hexyl acetate, heptyl acetate, <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> and phenyl ethyl acetate. With respect to the esters analyzed in this study, Atf 2 p seemed to play only a minor role compared to Atf 1 p. The atf 1 ? atf 2 ? double deletion strain did not form any isoamyl acetate, showing that together, Atf 1 p and Atf 2 p {{are responsible}} for the total cellular isoamyl alcohol acetyltransferase activity. However, the double deletion strain still produced considerable amounts of certain other esters, such as ethyl acetate (50 % of the wild-type strain), propyl acetate (50 %), and isobutyl acetate (40 %), which provides evidence for the existence of additional, as-yet-unknown ester synthases in the yeast proteome. Interestingly, overexpression of different alleles of ATF 1 and ATF 2 led to different ester production rates, indicating that differences in the aroma profiles of yeast strains may be partially due to mutations in their ATF genes. 10 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{mosquito}} Anopheles funestus {{is one of}} {{the major}} malaria vector species in sub-Saharan Africa. Olfaction is essential in guiding mosquito behaviors. Odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) are highly expressed in insect olfactory tissues and involved in the first step of odorant reception. An improved understanding of the function of malaria mosquito OBPs may contribute to identifying new attractants/repellents and assist in the development of more efficient and environmentally friendly mosquito controlling strategies. In this study, a large screening of over 50 ecologically significant odorant compounds led to the identification of 12 ligands that elicit significant electroantennographic (EAG) responses from An. funestus female antennae. To compare the absolute efficiency/potency of these chemicals, corrections were made for differences in volatility by determining the exact amount in a stimulus puff. Fourteen AfunOBP genes were cloned and their expression patterns were analyzed. AfunOBP 1, 3, 7, 20 and 66 showed olfactory tissue specificity by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that among olfactory-specific OBPs, AfunOBP 1 and 3 are the most enriched OBPs in female antennae. Binding assay experiments showed that at pH 7, AfunOBP 1 significantly binds to 2 -undecanone, nonyl acetate, <b>octyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and 1 -octen- 3 -ol but AfunOBP 3, which shares 68 % identify with AfunOBP 1 at amino acid level, showed nearly no binding activity to the selected 12 EAG-active odorant compounds. This work presents for the first time a study on the odorants and OBPs of the malaria vector mosquito An. funestus, which may provide insight into the An. funestus olfactory research, assist in a comparative study between major malaria mosquitoes An. gambiae and An. funestus olfactory system, and help developing new mosquito control strategies to reduce malaria transmission...|$|E
