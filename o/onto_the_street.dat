5|$|In 1853, Charles Moreign {{purchased}} {{several small}} houses {{at the end}} of Vine Street so they could be redeveloped into St James's Hall, Piccadilly. A rear entrance to the hall backed <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> The hall was demolished in 1905 and replaced by the Piccadilly Hotel, which also backs onto Vine Street.|$|E
5|$|In {{overhauling}} {{the structure}} of the premises, the National Trust restored its medieval character by recreating on the ground floor the appearance of arcaded stalls opening <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> and the sixteenth-century decoration of the upstairs windows, although this caused a dilemma as it required the removal of fine 18th-century windows.|$|E
5|$|On Christmas Day, Archie tells Ian the CD of the {{recording}} is under Ian's Christmas tree for Jane, but Ian fails to find it. Archie tells Janine that they should skip Christmas dinner as {{he has made a}} surprise treasure hunt for her. Janine eventually finds an envelope containing a one-way ticket to Poland and Archie throws her out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> telling her he knows how she and Ryan tried to double-cross him. Archie is visited by Jack who threatens to kill him if he hurts Ronnie again. Archie finds Ian searching his living room for the CD and Archie says it is on his laptop and he can make copies at any time, threatening Ian with a phone call to Jane, before ejecting him from the pub. Sam returns and attempts to confront Archie but he shuts the door on her. Ronnie then arrives and tells him with no emotion that he will not make her care for him and she would not care if he died. Archie throws her out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> reminding her that it was the exact spot she pushed Danielle onto the night she died.|$|E

5|$|At night, Francis spies on Dr. Caligari and observes {{what appears}} to be Cesare {{sleeping}} in his box. However, the real Cesare sneaks into Jane's home as she sleeps. He raises a knife to stab her, but instead abducts her after a struggle, dragging her through the window <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Chased by an angry mob, Cesare eventually drops Jane and flees; he soon collapses and dies. Francis also confirms that the caught criminal has been locked away and could not have been the attacker. Francis and the police investigate Dr. Caligari's sideshow and realize that the 'Cesare' sleeping in the box is only a dummy. Dr. Caligari escapes in the confusion. Francis follows and sees Caligari go through the entrance of an insane asylum.|$|E
5|$|Homer buys a book {{on world}} records {{published}} by Duff at a library sale. After boring everyone with world record trivia, Homer decides to break a record himself. He gathers the whole town to build the world's tallest human pyramid. After Jimbo and Kearney move their hands just before the record is claimed, the pyramid collapses into a giant sphere that rolls through town, taking in Agnes Skinner, Hans Moleman, and a suicidal man about to jump from a ledge <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> The entire town rolls to a truck weighing station and the Duff record book officials say that Springfield is the world's fattest town, ahead of Milwaukee.|$|E
5|$|Houses at Noel Park were {{deliberately}} {{designed to}} be relatively small, both for cheapness and to discourage tenants from taking on lodgers. Many of the larger houses at Shaftesbury Park had been sublet and split, and the practice went against {{the principles of the}} Artizans Company's founders. To discourage the practice at Queen's Park and Noel Park, cottage flats were built; these maintained the terraced façade, but split the house into upper and lower flats, each flat having a separate front door <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Many properties, particularly on the central Gladstone Avenue, were built in this style; this maintained the unbroken façade of the first-class houses, but allowed large numbers of smaller and low-income families to be housed.|$|E

5|$|Morrow {{ordered the}} {{motorcade}} {{to turn around}} at the Bridge Street intersection because he realised that they had proceeded further than expected, and because the police officers {{were not going to}} stop them. After partially turning the motorcade, Licciardello alighted <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and complained, in character as bin Laden, about not being invited to the APEC Summit. At this point, the police requested Morrow's identity. After inspecting his fake pass, officers realised that Morrow was from The Chaser and took all eleven members of the motorcade into custody. Surprisingly, as pointed out by the team on their television show, the officers initially ignored Licciardello (Osama Bin Laden) and only arrested Morrow.|$|E
5|$|NY47 {{followed}} the entire alignment of NY204 {{to what is}} now I-390 and continued on Brooks Avenue into Rochester to Genesee Park Boulevard. Route47 turned south <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> which circles around the southwestern quadrant of the city, and followed its length to Genesee Street, where it turned south for a short distance before resuming its eastward alignment on Elmwood Avenue. The route remained on Elmwood Avenue into Brighton, where it turned north onto South Winton Road at Twelve Corners. At Highland Avenue, NY47 reentered Rochester and became North Winton Road at East Avenue (NY96). The route remained on Winton through Rochester and Irondequoit before terminating at Empire Boulevard (then US104, now NY404) just west of Irondequoit Bay.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} is postponed {{and the parents}} are out looking for work when a prospective tenant appears. Mrs. O'Brien shows him the room and he is interested, but {{does not know what}} to do with the children. Mrs. O'Brien puts the children out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> where they dance to the music played by an organ grinder. The organ grinder earns more money from their dancing and he entices the children to return to his hovel and teaches them to dance. The organ grinder instructs them to dance for money. The children are rescued by a theater manager and finds them a place in the theater program.|$|E

5|$|Immediately upon {{arriving}} in South Africa, Gandhi faced discrimination {{because of his}} skin colour and heritage, like all people of colour. He {{was not allowed to}} sit with European passengers in the stagecoach and told to sit on the floor near the driver, then beaten when he refused; elsewhere he was kicked into a gutter for daring to walk near a house, in another instance thrown off a train at Pietermaritzburg after refusing to leave the first-class. He sat in the train station, shivering all night and pondering if he should return to India or protest for his rights. He chose to protest and was allowed to board the train the next day. In another incident, the magistrate of a Durban court ordered Gandhi to remove his turban, which he refused to do. Indians were not allowed to walk on public footpaths in South Africa. Gandhi was kicked by a police officer out of the footpath <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> without warning.|$|E
5|$|The Quarrymen {{played a}} series of seven Saturday night concerts in The Casbah for 15 shillings each, {{starting}} on 29 August to October 1959, featuring Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Brown, but without a drummer, and only one microphone connected to the club's small PA system. The opening night concert was attended by about 300 local teenagers, but as the cellar had no air-conditioning, and people were dancing, the temperature rose until it became hard to breathe. After {{the success of the}} first night, Mona gave The Quarrymen a residency, and paid the whole group £3 a night. Every Saturday thereafter, queues lengthened <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> which was financially good for Mona, as she charged one shilling admission on top of the annual membership fee. As there was no amplification, Lennon later persuaded Mona to hire a young amateur guitar player called Harry to play a short set before The Quarrymen, but this was only so they could use his 40-Watt amplifier.|$|E

Tripoli residents received text messages from the government, asking them to go out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and 'eliminate the armed agents'. Heavy fighting within the capital was confirmed by reporters within the city, who heard explosions and sustained gunfire.|$|E
25|$|Innovatively, {{the report}} {{recommended}} that some areas should change their outlook; rather than facing <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> shops could face onto squares or pedestrianised streets, with roof top or multi-storey parking nearby. Urban areas need not consist of buildings set alongside vehicular streets, instead multiple levels {{could be used}} with traffic moving underneath a building deck, with snug pedestrian alleys and contrasting open squares containing fountains and artwork.|$|E
25|$|Walker {{went south}} across Church Street toward the {{adjacent}} Roman Catholic church in Sydney Road. Prison officer Bennett had his rifle aimed at Walker and ordered Walker to halt {{or he would}} shoot. Walker took cover behind a small wall that bordered the church.

A plaque honoring his memory stood in the hospital's main entrance as a reminder of his dedication and sacrifice.|$|E
25|$|The High Street was {{for many}} centuries known instead as the Bristol Road, being {{the road from}} Shrewsbury to Bristol. It was once a much wider street within the town, with the churchyard of St Laurence {{bordering}} directly <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Over time buildings were erected on the street, {{in a similar fashion}} to other English market towns, such as in Ludlow. The High Street, which is a narrow street, is effectively only {{the eastern side of the}} original Bristol Road thoroughfare through the town. It was made more open when the old market hall was demolished to form the present town square.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{the area}} became Radio Row. New York City's Radio Row, which existed from 1921 to 1966, was a {{warehouse}} district on the Lower West Side in the Financial District. Harry Schneck opened City Radio on Cortlandt Street in 1921, {{and eventually the}} area held several blocks of electronics stores, with Cortlandt Street as its central axis. The used radios, war surplus electronics (e.g., ARC-5 radios), junk, and parts often piled so high they would spill out <b>onto</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> attracting collectors and scroungers. According to a business writer, it also was {{the origin of the}} electronic component distribution business.|$|E
