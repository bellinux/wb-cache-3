25|$|Later, Georgia also severed {{diplomatic}} relations with Nicaragua. Georgia moved to economically isolate the regions. A ban <b>on</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> in the regions without Georgian permission was issued, and anyone caught violating this ban by the Georgian authorities faced prosecution. The Georgian Navy blockaded the coast of Abkhazia, and has seized 23 cargo ships trying to bring supplies to Abkhazia, most notably fuel supplies. Abkhazia is dependent on fuel imports, and faced a serious shortage as a result. Russia began deploying boats from its own Black Sea Fleet on 21 September 2009, in response. In August 2009, Russia and South Ossetia accused Georgia of shelling Ossetian villages and kidnapping four South Ossetian citizens. Russia threatened to use force unless the shelling stopped, and put its troops stationed in South Ossetia on high alert.|$|E

500|$|The governments led by General Jaruzelski, {{throughout}} their existence (1981–1989), engaged in market economy reforms, {{aimed at improving}} economic performance by eliminating central planning, reducing central bureaucracy, introducing self-management and self-financing of state enterprises and allowing self-government by employee councils. The reform's effects were positive but limited (the process vastly increased general economic literacy {{and some of its}} accomplishments were later claimed by Solidarity governments as their own), because enterprises' self-rule had to compete with the traditional party interference, the authorities shied from subjecting the population to hardships, and Western governments and institutions showed no interest in supporting what was perceived as reform of a communist regime. The government allowed more small-scale private enterprises to function, departing further from the 'socialist' model of economy. Ideological considerations were abandoned and priority was given to pragmatic issues and moves. Searching for ways to improve the economy and conscious of its alienation from the industrial working class, the regime turned toward market reforms with an increasingly significant elite-oriented liberal (from the mid-1980s) component. Marketization, formalized by a 1988 statute <b>on</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activity,</b> was a process that would continue past the mid-1990s. Neoliberal processes may have been initiated by Deputy Prime Minister [...] and the government of Zbigniew Messner, then developed further under Minister Mieczysław Wilczek (author of the statute) and Mieczysław Rakowski's government. [...] "Market socialism" [...] was introduced, as the regime leaders actually lost their faith in the socialist system and even the nomenklatura managers were threatened by the declining economy. The enterprises were to be made independent, self-financing and self-managed, which included workers' councils that were resistant to restructuring. Owners of private businesses did well in the final years of the People's Republic and the number of such entities increased. Foreign investment was also encouraged, but limited marketization failed to deliver an economic turnaround. The practice of centralized economic decision making had not been overcome, while the newly autonomous enterprises moved toward a rather spontaneous, chaotic partial privatization of dubious legality that included elements of kleptocracy and had a significant middle-level nomenklatura component. On a more basic level, countless ordinary Poles took advantage of the changing attitudes and became involved in a great variety of income-producing activities.|$|E

40|$|This work {{advances}} {{the understanding}} of compensation demanded for environmental impacts on atmosphere, lakes and rivers, soil, and ocean generated by mining, urban, fishing and agriculture activities. Our aims are to determine whether compensation demanded depends on the standard variables used {{in the field of}} risk perception (as perceived risk, public acceptability and trust in regulating authorities), and to explore whether these relationships depend on the environment affected and <b>on</b> the <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> generating the impacts. General Linear Models were used to analyze survey responses from 427 citizens of Santiago, Chile. Results showed that compensation demanded depends on perceived risk, acceptability, and <b>on</b> the <b>economic</b> <b>activity,</b> but not <b>on</b> the environment affected. Acceptability depends on trust in authorities, on perceived risk and <b>on</b> the <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> Perceived risk depends <b>on</b> trust, the <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> and the environment affected. Overall, environmental impacts from the mining industry are perceived as riskier, less acceptable, and have a higher compensation demanded than those generated by the other sectors. These results suggest that to achieve sustainable development, regulations should consider not only environmental impacts but also the <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> originating them...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of non-economic factors and forces <b>on</b> <b>economic</b> <b>activities</b> and their outcomes is undeniable. Love, being {{so central to}} many human activities, should similarly have some effects <b>on</b> the <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> of nations. This paper (a) builds a simple but innovative model, (b) imposes it on a limited data set to estimate the effects of love experience and feeling <b>on</b> the <b>economic</b> <b>activity</b> {{of a group of}} 133 countries, and (3) compares such effects to those of other determinants of the <b>economic</b> <b>activity,</b> including Barro-Lee human capital, openness, and physical capital, as well as a broad measure of national well-being, HDI. The results strongly favor physical capital followed, by HDI and Barro-Lee human capital. Although small in magnitude, love effects are more statistically significant than those of openness. There appears to be some multicollinearity and model functional issues which challenge the robustness of the estimates and call for further research. However, the technical efficiency of the estimates is reasonable, so that one may conclude that love is important, but not critical to <b>economic</b> <b>activity.</b> The policy implications call for more investment in physical capital, schooling, and in the overall improvement of human development than in love experience and feeling, even though those are important too. ...|$|R
