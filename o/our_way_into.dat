500|$|In February 1890 Nansen {{addressed}} {{a meeting of}} the Norwegian Geographical Society in Oslo (then called Christiania). After drawing attention to the failures of the many expeditions which had approached the North Pole from the west, he considered the implications of the discovery of the Jeannette items, along with further finds of driftwood and other debris from Siberia or Alaska that had been identified along the Greenland coast. [...] "Putting all this together," [...] Nansen said, [...] "we are driven to the conclusion that a current flows ... from the Siberian Arctic Sea to the east coast of Greenland," [...] probably passing across the Pole. It seemed that the obvious thing to do was [...] "to make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the current {{on that side of the}} Pole where it flows northward, and by its help to penetrate into those regions which all who have hitherto worked against [...] have sought in vain to reach." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have found}} <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the spider's nest," [...] muttered Zinti, who grew afraid; [...] "but say, lady, how shall we find {{our way out}} of it?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us see," [...] Tom said, [...] "if we {{can make}} <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> any cell which may adjoin this. If it is empty we might, perchance, make our escape." ...|$|E
60|$|We made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> down <b>into</b> the garden, {{which they}} searched last. At the creek's side {{the boat was}} gone, and there were {{footsteps}} in the mud.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Silly child! Did you fancy my father's {{son would}} be taken alive? I and the first troop got away over the garden walls, and cut <b>our</b> <b>way</b> out <b>into</b> the plain, three hours ago.' ...|$|R
60|$|After {{months of}} {{wandering}} and hiding, Gil and I made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> here <b>into</b> Navarre, where we remain the guests of Protestant King Henri IV, {{who does not}} love King Philip any better since he has heard my story.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{no use to}} try {{and fight}} <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the drift through the hole," [...] he heard one of the new-comers say, and {{recognized}} the voice as that of Cale Billings.|$|E
6000|$|... "By no means!" [...] {{returned}} Queen Ann. [...] "We {{have already}} put {{the army of}} nomes to flight and all that yet remains is to force <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> those caverns, and conquer the Nome King and all his people." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not in}} Germany {{alone that}} we are disliked," [...] Maggie {{reminded}} him. [...] "We seem somehow or other to have found <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the bad books of every country in Europe. Clumsy statesmanship is it, or what?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} yet decided. We can go still farther south, into Texas, or make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> down <b>into</b> Phoenix and across the prairies to Imperial Valley, or follow the Santa Fe route {{by way of the}} Grand Canyon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{is a nice}} business!" [...] {{the latter}} exclaimed. [...] "We had better find our ponies and make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> down <b>into</b> the valley at once. Seeing how thick the fog has come on, the Sardinians may not return here at all." ...|$|R
40|$|In contemplating {{research}} futures for Education, it {{is important}} not simply to be acutely and critically aware of what constitutes the field’s present moment, but also of how its past trajectories and pathways, its traces, linger and leave their marks in how we think <b>our</b> <b>way,</b> now, <b>into</b> what might be. That is, the enterprise must b...|$|R
6000|$|... "Whether peacefully or not, we are {{determined}} that they shall be obtained. If it be needful, we will burn down London and kill every man of rank who falls into our hands, and force <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the king's presence. We will have justice!" ...|$|E
60|$|Either the bribe or {{the threat}} had the desired effect, for the fellow grabbed {{at the money}} {{with one hand while}} with the other he {{surrendered}} the leash which held the lurcher. Leaving him to retrace his steps, we continued to make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the utmost recesses of the great swamp.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be a}} ticklish job to make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> Boston town now {{while the}} enemy is so keenly on the alert," [...] Archie said, {{as if there was}} no {{question}} in his mind but that we would set off without delay to do whatsoever we might to help our unfortunate comrade.|$|E
60|$|Life is {{a little}} plot of light. We enter, clasp a hand or two, and go <b>our</b> several <b>ways</b> back <b>into</b> the darkness. The mystery is {{infinitely}} pathetic and picturesque.|$|R
6000|$|... "My brave kinsman," [...] he said, [...] "I need ask you no questions, for I {{know but}} too well that my dear father has fallen; but rouse yourself, I pray you; let me bandage your wounds, which bleed fast, for {{you will want}} all your strength, and we must needs pursue <b>our</b> <b>way</b> well <b>into</b> the forest, for with to-morrow's dawn the Danes will scatter over the whole country." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well then, Corny," [...] said Guert, {{rising and}} {{stretching}} his fine frame like a lion roused from his lair, [...] "here's off. We {{can go to}} Ravensnest to sleep, to-day; and, to-morrow we will work <b>our</b> <b>way</b> out <b>into</b> the highway, and fall into the line of march of the army. I shall have another opportunity of seeing Mary Wallace, and of telling her how much I love her. That will be so much gained, at all events." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can never}} do it; {{you can never}} do it. It would be a march of more than twenty miles, and that, too, of {{tramping}} over brush and roots, and through swamps, in the dark; the trail of such a party would be wide, and {{we might have to}} fight <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the garrison after all. We will wait for the Mohican." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] he asked. [...] "I {{am one of}} {{the slaves}} of the world, a man who sits in his office and toils, year in and year out. We're caught in the Golden Web, you see. The time comes," [...] he continued, [...] "when we find <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> a little corner of the earth like this, and one realizes the {{gigantic}} folly of it." ...|$|E
60|$|Arriving at {{the shed}} door we stood {{motionless}} and silent while {{one might have}} counted twenty, our ears pricked up to catch the lightest sound which would tell of the approach of an enemy, after which, hearing nothing, we set about making <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the rude building and thence across the rubbish to where were the two casks which formed Horry Sims's prison.|$|E
6000|$|In {{many ways}} the war has brought us up all {{standing}} {{on the edge of}} an abyss. When it is over shall we go galloping over the edge, or, reining back, sit awhile in our saddles looking for a better track? We were all on the highway to a hell of material expansion and vulgarity, of cheap immediate profit, and momentary sensation; north and south in <b>our</b> different <b>ways,</b> all [...] "rattling into barbarity." [...] Shall we find <b>our</b> <b>way</b> again <b>into</b> a finer air, where self-respect, not profit, rules, and rare things and durable are made once more? ...|$|R
60|$|As we {{advanced}} {{we found}} a well-proportioned tunnel cut from the solid cliff. Its walls rose some twenty feet above the floor, which was about five feet in width. The roof was arched. We had no means of making a light, and so groped <b>our</b> <b>way</b> slowly <b>into</b> the ever-increasing darkness, Tars Tarkas keeping in touch with one wall while I felt along the other, while, to prevent our wandering into diverging branches and becoming separated or lost in some intricate and labyrinthine maze, we clasped hands.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{said the}} parson; [...] "and I'll do my best. But I'll {{tell you what}} I am afraid of: if we find him in bed we must wait for him, and when the servant tells him who we are, and {{mentions}} the doctor's name along with yours, my lord, he'll guess what we're come about, and he'll {{be out of the}} window, or into the cellar, and then there'd be no catching him without the police. We must make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> up <b>into</b> his bed-room." ...|$|R
60|$|By {{this time}} night had closed in {{save for a}} single long, narrow slit in the westward. Stumbling across the moor together, we made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the Wigtown Road, {{at the point where}} the high stone pillars mark the {{entrance}} to the Cloomber avenue. A tall dog-cart stood in front of the gateway, the horse browsing upon the thin border of grass which skirted the road.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, Colonel, {{you shall}} know everything. Let us all go round {{and have a}} look at the horse together. Here he is," [...] he continued, as we made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the {{weighing}} enclosure, where only owners and their friends find admittance. [...] "You have only to wash his face and his leg in spirits of wine, and you will find that he is the same old Silver Blaze as ever." ...|$|E
60|$|One {{after the}} other we made <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> a large apartment, which was evidently that in which Mr. Melas had found himself. The {{inspector}} had lit his lantern, and by its light {{we could see the}} two doors, the curtain, the lamp, and the suit of Japanese mail as he had described them. On the table lay two glasses, and empty brandy-bottle, and the remains of a meal.|$|E
5000|$|Paul Menard {{brought out}} the third caution on lap 135 after blowing an engine on the backstretch. Describing the incident, Menard said, “Something with the motor. I {{had a really good}} car. It’s too bad, awesome car; we had a pit stop problem and went to the back, but drove <b>our</b> <b>way</b> back up <b>into</b> the top 15 or so.” ...|$|R
2500|$|In May 2008, a {{handmade}} poster {{created by}} Elisabeth, {{her children and}} her mother at the therapy facility was displayed in the Amstetten town centre. The message thanked local people for their support. [...] "We, the whole family, {{would like to take}} the opportunity {{to thank all of you}} for sympathy at our fate", they wrote in their message. [...] "Your compassion is helping us greatly to overcome these difficult times, and it shows us there also are good and honest people here who really care for us. We hope that soon there will be a time where we can find <b>our</b> <b>way</b> back <b>into</b> a normal life." ...|$|R
5000|$|Given the {{principal}} role attributed to Shankara in Advaita tradition, his works {{have been examined}} by scholars for similarities with Buddhism. Buddhism supporters have targeted Shankara, states , while his Hindu supporters state that [...] "accusations" [...] concerning explicit or implicit Buddhist influence are not relevant. Daniel Ingalls writes, [...] "If we are to adopt a metaphysical and static view of philosophy there is little difference between Shankara and Vijnanavada Buddhism, so little, in fact that the whole discussion is fairly pointless. But {{if we try to}} think <b>our</b> <b>way</b> back <b>into</b> minds of philosophers whose works we read, there is a very real difference between the antagonists".|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't suppose we've {{got enough}} for the run across," [...] {{he said after a}} short pause; [...] "but we can take on plenty of wood, or make <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> Nassau, where, by giving a {{distress}} note on the steamer, {{it will be possible to}} get all that may be needed. If we could only manage to patch the bow a little better I wouldn't feel worried about anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{would gladly}} work <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the offing in this mode, {{three or four}} leagues," [...] he said, [...] "by which means we might make a fair wind of it. As it is, we must get all clear, and {{do as well as}} we can. Rig the masts in the launch, Mr. Leach, and we will see what can be done with this dull craft we have in tow." ...|$|E
60|$|As already observed, {{it was an}} intolerably hot day. After {{leaving the}} house, we found <b>our</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the {{principal}} street of the town, which, it may be fair to say, is of very different aspect from the wretched outskirt above described. Entering a hotel (in which, as a Dumfries guide-book assured us, Prince Charles Edward had once spent a night), we rested and refreshed ourselves, and then set forth in quest of the mausoleum of Burns.|$|E

6000|$|When I {{got back}} that evening, Ada, {{who had been}} rather silent on <b>our</b> <b>way</b> home, came <b>into</b> my room, as she usually did, for a talk, and said, [...] "Agnes, I was going {{down the stairs to}} get an ice, and I saw you and Lord Holmeskirk go into the {{conservatory}} together, and you were there when I came up again, and I am quite sure by both your looks that he has made you an offer. Well?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Ospreys {{head coach}} Sean Holley {{reacted to the}} win saying [...] "it's a special night, I wouldn't say it was our best performance, but {{certainly}} {{one of our most}} courageous and determined." [...] "Leinster are pretty outstanding in defence, and it's the end of a long, hard season, I'm not that surprised (we cut through them), because we have some great talent."Departing Leinster coach Michael Cheika reacted to the loss by saying [...] "Ospreys deserved the win but we're disappointed with ourselves. We didn't play well, we tried to fight <b>our</b> <b>way</b> back <b>into</b> the game, but we made too many mistakes. We probably just weren't accurate in the defensive section or where we needed to be in the team." ...|$|R
