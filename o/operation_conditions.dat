2500|$|The {{rational}} {{system of}} aircraft procurement {{was to be}} exemplified by the Military Aircraft Competition held on Salisbury Plain at Larkhill, announced late in 1911. [...] The rules called for two-seater aircraft capable of various speed, climb, endurance and field <b>operation</b> <b>conditions.</b> O'Gorman was on the judging committee, so the B.E.1 {{was not allowed to}} compete; nevertheless it put in regular appearances at the trials, where its performance was clearly superior to most of the competing aircraft. [...] The B.E.1 was followed by the almost identical B.E.2 design, mass-produced with minor changes as the B.E.2a and later developed into the B.E.2c by E. T. Busk. Busk's objective was to create an inherently stable aircraft for military observation purposes. [...] Unfortunately the aircraft's stability resulted in a loss of manoeverability, and when German aircraft fitted with synchronised guns appeared in 1915 the large-scale losses of B.E.2c during the Fokker Scourge of 1915 led to a parliamentry inquiry. [...] Although this did not find O'Gorman at fault it led to O'Gorman's departure from the Factory: his contract, which was to expire in October, was not renewed. [...] O'Gorman, now holding the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Royal Flying Corps, remained as a consulting engineer to the Director-General of Military Aeronautics from 1916 to 1919.|$|E

50|$|Up to now, it {{has been}} almost {{impossible}} to foresee the temperature distribution along the cable route, so that the maximum applicable current load was usually set as a compromise between understanding of <b>operation</b> <b>conditions</b> and risk minimization. The availability of industrial distributed temperature sensing (DTS) systems that measure in real time temperatures all along the cable {{is a first step}} in monitoring the transmission system capacity. This monitoring solution is based on using passive optical fibers as temperature sensors, either integrated directly inside a high voltage cable or mounted externally on the cable insulation. A solution for overhead lines is also available. In this case the optical fiber is integrated into the core of a phase wire of overhead transmission lines (OPPC). The integrated Dynamic Cable Rating (DCR) or also called Real Time Thermal Rating (RTTR) solution enables not only to continuously monitor the temperature of a high voltage cable circuit in real time, but to safely utilize the existing network capacity to its maximum. Furthermore, it provides the ability to the operator to predict the behavior of the transmission system upon major changes made to its initial operating conditions.|$|E
