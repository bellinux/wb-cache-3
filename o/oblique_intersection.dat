25|$|MD 117's partial {{interchange}} with I-270 {{was constructed}} in 1987; to that point, MD 117's access to I-270 had been indirect via the Interstate's interchange with Quince Orchard Road, which had been built as a county highway concurrent with the freeway in 1956. MD 117 was expanded to a divided highway from west of MD 118 to MD 119 in Germantown and {{on either side of}} its intersection with MD 124 in Gaithersburg by 1999. Since at least 1950, West Diamond Avenue had passed under MD 355's bridge across the railroad and met that highway at an <b>oblique</b> <b>intersection.</b> In 1987, MD 355's bridge was replaced with the present bridge and the <b>oblique</b> <b>intersection</b> was replaced with a more gentle curve and right-in/right-out interchange with northbound MD 355. In 1991, access to southbound MD 355 was added via what is now MD 117A. In 2003, the right-in/right-out interchange with northbound MD 355 was removed. Old Towne Road was built as an extension of West Diamond Avenue to Summit Avenue in downtown Gaithersburg. Northbound MD 355 connected with this extension via Fulks Corner Avenue. The piece of MD 117 from the removed ramps to Fulks Corner Road became a short, municipally maintained extension of MD 117. In 2012, MD 117 was truncated at the intersection with MD 117A west of the MD 355 overpass.|$|E

40|$|The {{complex problem}} of {{strength}} verification of a buried steel pipeline crossing the {{trace of a}} normal active fault is treated analytically, and a refined methodology for the calculation of the axial and bending pipeline strains is presented. In essence, the proposed methodology extends the analytical methodology originally proposed by Karamitros et al. [1] for the simpler case of strike-slip fault crossings. The modifications introduced to the original methodology are first identified, following a thorough examination of typical results from advanced 3 D nonlinear numerical analyses, and consequently expressed via an easy to apply solution algorithm. A set of similar numerical analyses, performed {{for a wide variety}} of fault plane inclinations and intersection angles between the pipeline axis and the fault trace, is used to check the accuracy of the analytical predictions. Fairly good agreement is testified for pipeline strains up to 1. 50 - 2. 00 %. It is further shown that, although the methodology proposed herein applies strictly to the case of right intersection angles, it may be readily extended to <b>oblique</b> <b>intersections,</b> when properly combined with existing analytical solutions for strike-slip fault crossings (e. g. [11]). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

50|$|US 11 turns west onto Burhans Boulevard and {{immediately}} crosses over the Norfolk Southern rail line again. The federal highway curves to the north, paralleling the rail line, then crosses over the Winchester and Western rail line as its junction with the Norfork Southern line. US 11 continues north through a residential neighborhood before passing by the Hagerstown Roundhouse Museum and passing under CSX's Lurgan Subdivision {{just east of}} its wye with the Norfolk Southern line. At the intersection with Elgin Boulevard and Lanvale Street, US 11 turns east to remain on Burhans Boulevard and starts to parallel the CSX rail line. The federal highway and railroad curve to the north, where the highway intersects US 40 {{on the opposite side}} of the tracks from downtown Hagerstown. US 40 consists of a one-way pair, Washington Street eastbound and Franklin Street westbound. Between the two directions of US 40, US 11 passes the historic Western Maryland Railway Station, which is now the headquarters of the Hagerstown Police Department. North of US 40, US 11 intersects Salem Avenue, crosses Norfolk Southern Railway's Lurgan Branch, and curves north away from CSX's Hanover Subdivision, which turns to the east. Burhans Boulevard reaches its northern end at an <b>oblique</b> three-way <b>intersection</b> with Pennsylvania Avenue.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{techniques}} for an automated extraction, classification and modelling of 3 D objects will be presented. They use solely laserscanning derived digital elevation models as data basis. Trees, buildings and terrain objects are detected and classified. Firstly, a special region growing algorithm segments 3 D objects on the terrain surface. Object specific features are extracted inside these segments {{and used for}} classification {{by means of a}} fuzzy logic approach. Subsequently, a quality analysis is based on classification rates which are compiled in a confusion matrix. For geometric modelling of buildings a generic approach is used where buildings are approximated by (<b>oblique)</b> planes. The <b>intersection</b> of neighbouring planes leads to building edges and corners. The quality analysis of these building models is separated into positioning and height accuracy. First experimental results are presented. 1...|$|R
