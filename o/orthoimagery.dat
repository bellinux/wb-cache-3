The topographic map was created from the stereorestitution of a GeoEye- 1 bundle satellite stereopair, 0. 5 m pan-sharpened imagery covering an area of about 100 km². This map was utilized for the geological survey, for the archaeological interpretation of the palaeo-environmental evolution of the site which bases on the present geomorphologic setting, and for the reconstruction of possible travelling paths within a central region of the Hittite empire. The aerial triangulation of satellite images, performed using ground control points measured specifically by means of differential GPS surveys, allowed the stereoscopic visualization of the area and the creation of the digital terrain model and orthophotos. These results were a useful aid during the geological survey when all the outcrops were inspected and documented through additional in-depth field checks. The geological map has been created and refined using the digital terrain model and photointerpretation of stereo and <b>orthoimageries,</b> making it possible to fully identify the geological boundaries between formations and recognize geomorphological features...|$|R

In previous work, we developed techniques to automatically correct the alignment of vector data with <b>orthoimagery</b> using a technique called conflation.

40|$|This paper {{evaluates the}} {{geometric}} effects of pansharpening algorithms on automatically generated DSMs and thus on the resulting <b>orthoimagery</b> through a {{quantitative assessment of}} the accuracy on the end products. The main motivation {{was based on the}} fact that for automatically generated Digital Surface Models, an image correlation step is employed for extracting correspondences between the overlapping images. Thus their accuracy and reliability is strictly related to image quality, while pansharpening may result into lower image quality which may affect the DSM generation and the resulting orthoimage accuracy. To this direction, an iterative methodology was applied in order to combine the process described by Agrafiotis and Georgopoulos (2015) with different pansharpening algorithms and check the accuracy of <b>orthoimagery</b> resulting from pansharpened data. Results are thoroughly examined and statistically analysed. The overall evaluation indicated that the pansharpening process didn’t affect the geometric accuracy of the resulting DSM with a 10 m interval, as well as the resulting <b>orthoimagery.</b> Although some residuals in the orthoimages were observed, their magnitude cannot adversely affect the accuracy of the final <b>orthoimagery...</b>|$|E

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper investigates the effect of the radiometry of the underwater imagery on automating the 3 D reconstruction and the produced <b>orthoimagery.</b> Main aim is to investigate whether pre-processing of the underwater imagery improves the 3 D reconstruction using automated SfM - MVS software or not. Since the processing of images either separately or in batch is a time-consuming procedure, it is critical to determine the necessity of implementing colour correction and enhancement before the SfM - MVS procedure or directly to the final orthoimage when the <b>orthoimagery</b> is the deliverable. Two different test sites were used to capture imagery ensuring different environmental conditions, depth and complexity.

Moreover, object-oriented classification has exhibited significant advantages over different classification methods for delineation of tree crowns {{and recognition of}} species in various types of ecosystems. However, it still is unclear if this widely-used classification method can have its advantages on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) digital images for mapping vegetation cover at single-tree levels. In this study, UAV <b>orthoimagery</b> was classified using object-oriented classification method for mapping a part of wild pistachio nature reserve in Zagros open woodlands, Fars Province, Iran. This research focused on recognizing two main species {{of the study area}} (i. e., wild pistachio and wild almond) and estimating their mean crown area. The orthoimage of study area was consisted of 1, 076 images with spatial resolution of 3. 47 cm which was georeferenced using 12 ground control points (RMSE= 8 cm) gathered by real-time kinematic (RTK) method. The results showed that the UAV <b>orthoimagery</b> classified by object-oriented method efficiently estimated mean crown area of wild pistachios (52. 09 ± 24. 67 m 2) and wild almonds (3. 97 ± 1. 69 m 2) with no significant difference with their observed values (α= 0. 05). In addition, the results showed that wild pistachios (accuracy of 0. 90 and precision of 0. 92) and wild almonds (accuracy of 0. 90 and precision of 0. 89) were well recognized by image segmentation. In general, we concluded that UAV <b>orthoimagery</b> can efficiently produce precise biophysical data of vegetation stands at single-tree levels, which therefore is suitable for assessment and monitoring open woodlands...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{especially}} {{within the}} last two decades, the demand for DSMs (Digital Surface Models) and 3 D city models has increased dramatically. This has arisen due {{to the emergence of}} new applications beyond construction or analysis and consequently to a focus on accuracy and the cost. This thesis addresses two linked subjects: first improving the quality of the DSM by merging different source DSMs using a Bayesian approach; and second, extracting building footprints using approaches, including Bayesian approaches, and producing 3 D models. Regarding the first topic, a probabilistic model has been generated based on the Bayesian approach in order to merge different source DSMs from different sensors. The Bayesian approach is specified to be ideal in the case when the data is limited and this can consequently be compensated by introducing the a priori. The implemented prior is based on the hypothesis that the building roof outlines are specified to be smooth, for that reason local entropy has been implemented in order to infer the a priori data. In addition to the a priori estimation, the quality of the DSMs is obtained by using field checkpoints from differential GNSS. The validation results have shown that the model was successfully able {{to improve the quality of}} the DSMs and improving some characteristics such as the roof surfaces, which consequently led to better representations. In addition to that, the developed model has been compared with the Maximum Likelihood model which showed similar quantitative statistical results and better qualitative results. Perhaps it is worth mentioning that, although the DSMs used in the merging have been produced using satellite images, the model can be applied on any type of DSM. The second topic is building footprint extraction based on using satellite imagery. An efficient flow-line for automatic building footprint extraction and 3 D model construction, from both stereo panchromatic and multispectral satellite imagery was developed. This flow-line has been applied in an area of different building types, with both hipped and sloped roofs. The flow line consisted of multi stages. First, data preparation, digital <b>orthoimagery</b> and DSMs are created from WorldView- 1. Pleiades imagery is used to create a vegetation mask. The <b>orthoimagery</b> then undergoes binary classification into ‘foreground’ (including buildings, shadows, open-water, roads and trees) and ‘background’ (including grass, bare soil, and clay). From the foreground class, shadows and open water are removed after creating a shadow mask by thresholding the same <b>orthoimagery.</b> Likewise roads have been removed, for the time being, after interactively creating a mask using the <b>orthoimagery.</b> NDVI processing of the Pleiades imagery has been used to create a mask for removing the trees. An ‘edge map’ is produced using Canny edge detection to define the exact building boundary outlines, from enhanced <b>orthoimagery.</b> A normalised digital surface model (nDSM) is produced from the original DSM using smoothing and subtracting techniques. Second, start Building Detection and Extraction. Buildings can be detected, in part, in the nDSM as isolated relatively elevated ‘blobs’. These nDSM ‘blobs’ are uniquely labelled to identify rudimentary buildings. Each ‘blob’ is paired with its corresponding ‘foreground’ area from the <b>orthoimagery.</b> Each ‘foreground’ area is used as an initial building boundary, which is then vectorised and simplified. Some unnecessary details in the ‘edge map’, particularly on the roofs of the buildings can be removed using mathematical morphology. Some building edges are not detected in the ‘edge map’ due to low contrast in some parts of the <b>orthoimagery.</b> The ‘edge map’ is subsequently further improved also using mathematical morphology, leading to the ‘modified edge map’. Finally, A Bayesian approach is used to find the most probable coordinates of the building footprints, based on the ‘modified edge map’. The proposal that is made for the footprint a priori data is based on the creating a PDF which assumes that the probable footprint angle at the corner is 90 o and along the edge is 180 o, with a less probable value given to the other angles such as 45 o and 135 o. The 3 D model is constructed by extracting the elevation of the buildings from the DSM and combining it with the regularized building boundary. Validation, both quantitatively and qualitatively has shown that the developed process and associated algorithms have successfully been able to extract building footprints and create 3 D models...|$|E

Althought the classical methods for processing and validation of remote sensing data are well established and provide straigthforward approach, the rapid introduction of digital airborn imaging systems in the market poses new challenges {{with respect to the}} implementation of standartized approach for production and quality control. The ¿Guidelines for Best Practice and Quality Checking of Ortho Imagery¿ document, developed by GeoCAP team of Agriculture Unit, JRC, aimed to provide the European Commission and the remote sensing user community with a general framework of the best approaches for quality checking of orthorectified remotely sensed imagery, and the expected best practice, required to achieve good results. These guidelines were used as a core reference document in the Control with Remote Sensing Program of the European Commission, supporting the Common Agriculture Policy. In this respect, they apply to digital <b>orthoimagery</b> products, generated from either film cameras or digital instruments, on both airborne or satellite platforms, used in the management, monitoring and control of agricultural subsidies and to some degree (particularly very high spatial resolutions) large scale mapping or cadastre applications. In 2007, a revision of these guidelines, was initiated in order to incoprorate the new sensors and techologies emerged (for example, the airborne digital cameras) and to make the document more generic, consolidating all the changes and ammendments done in the last years. Attention was given to the important and common steps in the photogrammetric process, and to the definition of quality control checks (ISO compliant), which are clear to understand and easy to apply.

Researchers have developed various rules for initial seed selection and stop criteria when applying the algorithm. However, research has rarely {{focused on the}} impact of tree-oriented growth order. This study implemented a marker-controlled region growing (MCRG) algorithm that considers homogeneity, crown size, and shape using airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, and investigated the impact of three growth orders (i. e., sequential, independent, and simultaneous) on tree crown delineation. The study also investigated the benefit of combining ALS data and <b>orthoimagery</b> in treetop detection at both plot and individual tree levels. The results showed that complementary data from the <b>orthoimagery</b> reduced omission error associated with small trees in the treetop detection procedure and improved treetop detection percentage on a plot level by 2 %– 5 % compared to ALS alone. For tree crown delineation, the growth order applied in the MCRG algorithm influenced accuracy. Simultaneous growth yielded slightly higher accuracy (about 2 % improvement for producer’s and user’s accuracy) than sequential growth. Independent growth provided comparable accuracy to simultaneous growth in this study by dealing with overlapping pixels among trees according to crown shape.

These problems cause great inefficiencies in production, dissemination through web services and processing in “Big Data” environments. Most of them can be avoided, or at least greatly reduced, {{with the use of a}} common “nested grid” for mutiresolution production, archiving, dissemination and exploitation of <b>orthoimagery,</b> digital elevation models and other raster data. “Nested grids” are space allocation schemas that organize image footprints, pixel sizes and pixel positions at all pyramid levels, in order to achieve coherent and consistent multiresolution coverage of a whole working area. A “nested grid” must be complemented by an appropriate “tiling schema”, ideally based on the “quad-tree” concept. In the last years a “de facto standard” grid and Tiling Schema has emerged and has been adopted by virtually all major geospatial data providers. It has also been adopted by OGC in its “WMTS Simple Profile” standard.
