In the late 1960s, the {{province}} of Groningen requested the national government for subsidy to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> museum in Bellingwolde. The subsidy was not granted, but the state paid indirectly {{for the restoration of}} the museum building via a subsidized employment project.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s the Government of the State of São Paulo planned to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{research}} center {{in the interior of}} the state to promote development and industrialization in the region, and commissioned Zeferino Vaz, founder of the University of São Paulo's School of Medicine in Ribeirão Preto, to organize it. In parallel, a medical school was being planned in Campinas, a demand from the local population that dated from the early 1940s. The School of Medicine of Campinas was created by law in 1959, but actual implementation never took place.|$|E
5|$|Meiklejohn {{resolved}} to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>new,</b> experimental {{liberal arts college}} in late 1924, but struggled to find funding.

The planning team included journalist Mark Sullivan, New School professor Alvin Johnson, and The Century Magazine editor-in-chief Glenn Frank. Frank had previously published Meiklejohn's work and was sympathetic to his cause.|$|E

The Orange Line does not run 24 hours a day (unlike the Blue Line, which has 24-hour service to O'Hare), but does operate from about 4:00am to 1:00am, at an average of 8-minute intervals. The trip from Midway to the Loop takes 25 minutes.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, {{the council}} planned to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> mixed {{secondary}} modern at Westholme and, by 1960, Sleaford Secondary Modern School was operating there alongside its original buildings on Church Lane. In 1983, an extension to the Westholme block opened, allowing {{the school to}} close the old site; new teaching blocks were then built around the grounds. The school {{changed its name to}} St George's School in 1984, became a technology college in 1992 and converted to St George's Academy in 2010. The house continued {{to be used as a}} library into the 1980s, but by the next decade, had become the school's sixth form base and an adult education centre. As a result of major rebuilding work at St George's in 2011–12, a new sixth form centre opened and Westholme House was converted into the school's administrative centre.|$|E
5|$|In June 1869, Meessen and {{his wife}} {{returned}} to Batavia, and the following year they returned to Utrecht. There, in late 1870, Meessen partnered with Abraham Adrianus Vermeulen to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> studio, named A.A. Vermeulen & Company. They signed a contract for five years, but this collaboration collapsed in March 1873. Boom and Wachlin suggest that Vermeulen– best known for portraits– had been interested {{in the possibility of}} expanding his range with landscapes, whereas Meessen required a place to print and market his images of the Indies. Indeed, in February 1871 Meessen gifted an album of his better-executed photographs from his time in Java and Sumatra to King William III. This album of 153images was lavishly decorated with silver and gold, and featured the names of Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and Nias in the corners. In the center were silver coconut and banana trees surrounding Dutch and Batavian weapons.|$|E

5|$|In a {{significant}} {{contrast to the}} political scene in South Vietnam, the North Vietnamese government in Hanoi were far more occupied with their military effort. The North Vietnamese Transportation Group 559, then {{under the leadership of}} Major-General Phan Trong Tue, was ordered to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> transportation and communication lines through southern Laos and South Vietnam. The purpose was to facilitate the movement of troops and material through the Pathet Lao-occupied section of the Ho Chi Minh trail. They were supported by 1,500 workers from the Ministry of Transportation and 7,600 volunteers. By the end of 1965, the strength of Group 559 had grown to 24,400 personnel organised in six battalions of motor vehicles, one battalion of boats, 18 battalions of combat engineers, four battalions of anti-aircraft artillery and guard units. In addition to the expansion of their logistical abilities, the North Vietnamese also decided to establish five infantry divisions and one artillery in South Vietnam. Thus, the stage was set for a major military struggle with American and other allied forces.|$|E
5|$|Seeking a {{fresh start}} {{a few months after}} his {{departure}} from the Papua New Guinea team, Serevi moved his family to the United States and settled in Seattle, Washington, to run a business with Fijian expatriates. He used his experience in rugby to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> brand, the Serevi Rugby Nation, to help pool funds for Pacific Islander players and also run rugby training workshops for the youth. He also worked with the Old Puget Sound Rugby club, and helped Central Washington University qualify for the Collegiate Rugby Championships. On 6 October 2011, Serevi returned to Fiji and declared his availability to coach the team in qualifying for the 2013 Sevens World Cup and help the team qualify for the 2016 Olympic Games.

5|$|Sport {{was first}} {{played at the}} Turf Moor site in 1833, when Burnley Cricket Club was founded and made an area which {{encompasses}} the current football ground their home. Horse racing also {{took place at the}} site in 1840. In 1883, the cricket club invited Burnley Football Club, which had been formed in 1882, to move from their original home at Calder Vale to a football pitch adjacent to the cricket field, retaining {{the western part of the}} larger site for their pavilion. The first football match at Turf Moor took place on 17 February 1883, when Burnley were defeated 3–6 by Rawtenstall. Attendances at Turf Moor during the early years averaged at around 2,000, although a crowd of 12,000 descended on the stadium on 29 March 1884 to see Burnley lose 2–4 to local rivals Padiham. For the first two years, spectators were forced to congregate around the pitch, so in 1885 the club built an 800-seater wooden grandstand along the Brunshaw Road side (the south side) of the ground and installed terracing for 5,000 people at the ends of the pitch. The following year, Turf Moor became the first senior football ground to be visited by a member of the British Royal Family when Prince Albert Victor saw Burnley defeated 3–4 by Bolton Wanderers on 13 October 1886, while visiting the town to <b>open</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> hospital.|$|E
