40|$|Software {{development}} {{life cycle}} models {{were believed to}} {{play a critical role}} in improving software quality by guiding tasks in the software development processes since being formally introduced and embraced in the 1970 s. Many organizations attempted to deploy software development life cycle methodologies with the intent to improve the software development process from conception through implementation to delivery. Numerous established software development models exist, including the classic waterfall life cycle model, Spiral model, Prototyping, Evolutionary, (e. g., Staged, Phased, and Timebox models), object-oriented design (OOD) (e. g., Rational Unified Process), and agile processes (e. g., eXtreme Programming [XP]). The design and development of web-based applications introduced new problems and requirements that did not exist when traditional software development life-cycle models were being put into practice. This research presents empirical software development practice data pertaining to web-based application development. The goal of this project was to answer the question, 2 ̆ 2 What is the general paradigm of an SDLC model for web-based application development? 2 ̆ 2 The focus of the project was to derive an empirical SDLC model for web-based application development. Data from current practices was collected via a web-based application. Study participants used the web-based application to input data concerning the SDLC model of their web-based application development process. The empirical model was derived from the data provided by participants on current professional web-based application development practices. The results of this research showed that although web-based application development life-cycle does parallel traditional SDLCs in some phases, there were enough differences that an exact fit to an existing model does not exist.

40|$|Load {{steering}} {{is widely}} {{accepted as a}} key SON function in cellular/WLAN interworking network. To investigate load optimizing from a perspective of system utilization maximization more than just offloading to improve APs’ usage, a utility maximization (UTMAX) optimization model and an ASRAO algorithm based on generalized Benders Decomposition are proposed in this paper. UTMAX is to maximize the sum of logarithmic utility functions of user data rate by jointly optimizing user association and resource allocation. To maintain the flexibility of resource allocation, a parameter β {{is added to the}} utility function, where smaller β means more resources can be allocated to edge users. As a result, it reflects a tradeoff between improvements in user throughput fairness and system total throughput. UTMAX {{turns out to be a}} mixed integer nonlinear programming, which is intractable intuitively.

40|$|Within {{this thesis}} a {{computational}} based design methodology for swash plate type axial piston pumps has been proposed. The methodology is divided in three design phases; preliminary design, computational design and computational based design optimization. The preliminary design {{is based on}} hand – calculations {{that are available to}} the general public. Pump designers in industry develop pumps using a similar method. Phase two incorporates the computational design. A methodology has been developed to use these two phases in order to develop a pump from start to finish. The computational part of the design process is based on the use of in-house developed software. The valve plate optimization tool VPOptim is used to optimize the valve plate. The clearances between the parts and the flow through these gaps are calculated using the simulation tool named CASPAR. An <b>optional</b> <b>phase</b> three is incorporates an optimization loop within phase two. This can be used to test new radical designs, new materials, or improve the results by using a more sophisticated surrogate model to design the part dimensions. In order to test the proposed methodology, an example pump was developed. The design methodology focuses on the rotating group of swash plate type axial piston pumps. The rotating group, determines the reliable operation of the machine, the achievable operating parameters and the efficiency. ^ The proposed new design approach can replace the current trial and error process and will hopefully lead to better designed pumps, that achieve higher efficiencies and use new materials and or coatings and do not need very experienced designers. The use of sophisticated computer models will give the designer much better understanding of the influence of individual design parameters on the pump behavior. The example design of the rotating group of 24 cc the pump demonstrated that the proposed approach is feasible and even a non-experienced pump designer can to create a design that has better performance and is more compact than existing industrial standards. ...|$|E
40|$|The overall program {{objective}} {{is to develop a}} mud-pulse measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tool for oil and gas drilling operations that can be used where downhole temperatures are as high as 195 C (383 F). The work was planned to be completed in two phases: Phase I and an <b>optional</b> <b>Phase</b> II. The objectives of Phase I were first to identify critical components of existing MWD systems that can or cannot operate at 195 C. For components not able to meet the higher standard, one of several strategies was pursued: (1) locate high-temperature replacement components, (2) develop new designs that eliminate the unavailable components, or (3) use cooling to keep components at acceptable operating temperatures (under 195 C). New designs and components were then tested under high temperatures in the laboratory. The final goal of Phase I was to assemble two high-temperature MWD prototype tools and test each in at least one low-temperature well to verify total system performance. Phase II was also envisioned as part of this development. Its objective would be to test the two new high-temperature MWD prototype tools in wells being drilled in the United States where the bottom-hole temperatures were 195 C (or the highest temperatures attainable). The high-temperature MWD tool is designed to send directional and formation data to the surface via mud pulses, to aid in the drilling of guided wellbores. The modules that comprise the tool are housed in sealed barrels that protect the electronics from exposure to down-hole fluids and pressures. These pressure barrels are hung inside a non-magnetic collar located above the drilling assembly. A number of significant accomplishments were achieved {{during the course of the}} Phase I project, including: (1) Tested two MWD strings for function in an oven at 195 C; (2) Conducted field test of prototype 195 C MWD tool (at well temperatures up to 140 - 180 C); (3) Tested ELCON hybrid chip with processor, clock, and memory in a custom package for 700 hours at 200 C; (4) Contracted with APS Technology to conduct study of thermoelectric cooling of downhole electronics; (5) Conducted successful Peltier cooling test with APS Technology; (6) Tested and improved the electronics of Sperry Sun's Geiger Muller-based gamma detector for operation at 195 C; (7) Developed two high-temperature magnetometers (one in-house, one with Tensor); and (8) Encouraged outside source to develop lithium/magnesium high-temperature batteries (operating temperature of 125 to 215 C). One of this project's greatest achievements was improvement in Sperry Sun's current tool with changes made as a direct result of work performed under this project. These improvements have resulted in longer life and a more robust MWD tool at the previous temperature rating of 175 C, as well as at higher temperatures. A field test of two prototype 195 C MWD tools was conducted in Lavaca County, Texas. The purpose of this operation was to provide directional services on a sidetrack of a straight hole. The sidetrack was to intersect the formation up-dip above the water/gas interface. In addition, the gamma tool provided formation data including seam tops and thickness. Results from these field tests indicate progress in the development of a 195 C tool. Although the pulsers failed downhole in both tools, failure of the pulsers was determined to be from mechanical rather than electrical causes. Analysis of the economics of the 195 C tool highlights the greatest obstacle to future commercialization. Costs to screen individual components, then subassemblies, and finally completed tools for high-temperature operations are very high. Tests to date also show a relatively short life for high-temperature tools [...] on the order of 300 hours.

Like other drugs, vaccines undergo long periods of pre-clinical development, followed by careful clinical testing through study Phases I, II, and III before they receive licensure. A successful candidate vaccine will move on to be an investigational vaccine to undergo three phases of pre-licensure clinical trials in a stepwise fashion {{before it can be}} considered for approval, followed by an <b>optional</b> fourth <b>phase</b> of post-marketing assessment. The overall risk-benefit assessment of a candidate vaccine is very critical in making the licensure decision for regulatory authorities, supported by their scientific committees. It includes analyses of immunogenicity, efficacy, reactogenicity or tolerability, and safety of the vaccine. Public trust in vaccines is a key to the success of immunization programs worldwide. Maintaining this trust requires knowledge of the benefits and scientific understanding of real or perceived risks of immunizations. Under certain circumstances, pre- or post-exposure passive immunization can be achieved by administration of immunoglobulines. In terms of prevention of infectious diseases, disinfection can be applied {{to reduce the risk of}} transmission of pathogens from patient to patient, health-care workers to patients, patients to health-care workers, and objects or medical devices to patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} overall performance, {{many of the}} modern {{advanced}} digital signal processors (DSPs) are equipped with on-chip multiple data memory banks which can be accessed in parallel in one instruction. In order to effectively exploit this architectural feature, the compiler must partition program variables between the memory banks appropriately – two parallel memory accesses always must take place on different memory banks. There is some research work that addresses this issue, however, most {{of this has been}} proposed as a post-pass (machine dependent) optimization. We attempt to resolve this problem by applying an algorithm which operates on the high-level intermediate representation, independent of the target machine. The partitioning scheme is based on the concepts of the interference graph which is constructed utilizing the control flow, data flow, and alias information. Partitioning of the interference graph is modeled as a Max Cut problem. The variable partitioning algorithm has been designed as an <b>optional</b> optimization <b>phase</b> integrated in the C compiler for a digital signal processor. This paper describes our efforts. The experimental results demonstrate that our partitioning algorithm finds a fairly good assignment of variables to memory banks. For small kernels from the DSPstone benchmark suite the performance is improved from 10 % to 20 %, for FFT filters by about 10 %. ...|$|R
40|$|Questions {{of state}} {{sovereignty}} are {{the cause of}} many conflicts today. The theory of earned sovereignty is an evolving concept. A review of recent practice in southern Sudan, Bougainville, and Aceh shows that the core elements of earned sovereignty offer a three-part roadmap for conflict resolution beginning with shared sovereignty, continuing through institution building, and ending at a determination of final status. Other parts of the theory called, “optional elements,” are tools stakeholders in a conflict situation may use {{in order to move}} from one core element to another until a final status solution is obtained. Though the <b>optional</b> elements of <b>phased</b> sovereignty, conditional sovereignty, and constrained sovereignty are parts of earned sovereignty they need not always be used. In-depth analysis of the peace agreements in southern Sudan, Bougainville, and Aceh show that, while the core elements are implemented throughout, the optional elements are used to varying degrees and in some instances not at all...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} effectiveness of adalimumab alone or in combination with standard disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) {{for the treatment of}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: Patients with active RA despite treatment with DMARDs or prior treatment with a tumour necrosis factor antagonist participated in a multicentre, open-label clinical study of adalimumab 40 mg every other week for 12 weeks with an <b>optional</b> extension <b>phase.</b> Patients were allowed to continue with pre-existing traditional DMARDs. Long- term safety results are reported for all patients (4210 patient-years (PYs) of adalimumab exposure). The observed effectiveness results at week 12 are reported using American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria. Results: Among the 6610 treated patients, adalimumab was generally well tolerated. Serious infections occurred in 3. 1 % of patients (5. 5 / 100 PYs, including active tuberculosis, 0. 5 / 100 PYs). Demyelinating disease (0. 06 %) and systemic lupus erythematosus (0. 03 %) were rare serious adverse events. The standardised incidence ratio of malignancy was 0. 71 (95 % CI 0. 49 to 1. 01). The standardised mortality ratio was 1. 07 (95 % CI 0. 75 to 1. 49). At week 12, 69 % of patients achieved an ACR 20 response, 83 % a moderate, and 33 % a good EULAR response. Adalimumab was effective in combination with a variety of DMARDs. The addition of adalimumab to antimalarials was comparably effective to the combination of adalimumab and methotrexate. Conclusions: Considering the limitations of an open- label study, adalimumab alone or in combination with standard DMARDs appeared to be well tolerated and effective in 6610 difficult- to- treat patients with active RA treated in clinical practice.
