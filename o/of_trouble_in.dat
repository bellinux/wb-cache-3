5|$|The Tour de France was {{the main}} {{focal point of the}} season for BMC's leader Evans, and perhaps the team itself. He had ridden two Grand Tours each of the past two seasons, and in three of the past four, but in 2011 he focused solely on the Tour. He rode a {{different}} race program in preparation for the Tour than he had in previous years, riding fewer races. Among them were the early-season stage races Tirreno–Adriatico and Tour de Romandie, both of which Evans won, and the Critérium du Dauphiné, where he finished on the podium in second overall. The squad named to the race was chosen with the sole goal of helping Evans win the race overall. It consisted of classics specialists Hincapie and Burghardt with the aim of keeping Evans out <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> the flatter stages, climbers Moinard and Morabito to help in the mountains, and strong time trialists Bookwalter and Schär (and Hincapie) for the stage 2 team time trial. Hincapie made his 16th consecutive Tour start, to tie the record held by Joop Zoetemelk, having finished each except the very first.|$|E
5|$|The high {{mountain}} Stage 14 into the Italian Alps saw Contador rise to second overall, just five seconds behind race leader Gabriele Bosisio. The next day, Contador finished twelve minutes ahead of Bosisio {{and took the}} race leader's pink jersey. His main rival at that point was Riccardo Riccò, who had gained 16 seconds on him that day and was only 33 back overall. Contador padded his lead over Riccò slightly in short time trial in Stage 16, and stayed out <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> Stages 17 and 18, stages where the contenders all finished together. The long and mountainous Stage 19 saw Riccò and Danilo Di Luca both put time into Contador with late attacks, {{but not enough to}} take the jersey from him. Di Luca found himself effected the next day, losing over five minutes and falling from contention, but Contador and Riccò finished together and were separated by just 4 seconds entering the Stage 21 time trial. Riccò was unable to challenge Contador in the Giro's finale, finishing 68th on the stage and losing close to two minutes to Contador, who was 11th. Though neither Contador himself nor anyone from the team won any stage in the Giro, Contador took the overall victory in the General Classification.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: There {{were three}} {{purpose of this}} study;(1) {{exploring}} successful factors <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting diagnoses <b>in</b> single-chip microprocessor; (2) analyzing the thinking processes of sampling group possessing successful achievement;(3) designing the diagnoses processes <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting <b>in</b> single-chip microprocessor circuits. 16 students of Electrical Engineering were sampled to participate the experiments in three types of diagnoses processes <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting <b>in</b> single-chip microprocessor circuits. Recording their experimental procedures, thinking aloud procedure and using protocol analysis were three main research methods in this study. The conclusion after data analyzing was as following: The successful factors of the diagnoses processes <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting <b>in</b> single-chip microprocessor circuits consists of professional knowledge, comprehension for circuits, fully taking advantage of strategies, wisely making use of electric meters, judging defining qualities of components, and using sensory assessment. The procedures for diagnoses processes <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting <b>in</b> single-chip microprocessor circuits are judging symptoms <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting, searching <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> shooting points <b>in</b> circuit, firmly determining trouble shooting points, executing repair activities, accomplishing repairing process. The rank <b>of</b> indicated <b>trouble</b> shooting behaviors were that visual behavior was the most judging activity among all and sensory assessment was the most strategy among all while using electric meter...|$|R

The origins of this tradition have been dated at least to the 16th century.

25|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First Balkan war caused Venizelos a great deal <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> his relations with Crown Prince Constantine. Part of the problems {{can be attributed to}} the complexity of the official relations between the two men. Although Constantine was a Prince and the future King, he also held the title of army commander, thus remaining under the direct order of the Ministry of Military Affairs, and subsequently under Venizelos. But his father, King George, in accordance to the constitutional conditions of the time had been the undisputed leader of the country. Thus in practical terms Venizelos' authority over his commander of the army was diminished due to the obvious relation between the Crown Prince and the King.|$|E
25|$|In November 1824, Bremer sailed for India {{where he}} served in the First Anglo-Burmese War. On 25 January 1836, he was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Hanoverian Guelphic Order (KCH). In 1837, Port Essington was again {{selected}} as a possible trading station by Baron Glenelg. Bremer, who commanded the Alligator and Britomart, was again given charge of the expedition. He established a new post in October 1838, calling it Port Victoria. The port was active until 1843 and by 1849, Port Essington was abandoned after it had no commercial or military value. Under the encouragement of New South Wales Governor George Gipps, Bremer left Port Essington for China in June 1839, with the ships under his command, after news <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> the Chinese city of Canton.|$|E

25|$|After Theodoric Strabo died in 481, {{the future}} Theoderic the Great became {{king of the}} entire Ostrogoth nation and began {{to be a source}} <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> the Balkan peninsula. Zeno allied to Theoderic, whom he {{appointed}} magister militum praesentalis and even consul for the year 484, the first time a barbarian who was not a citizen of the Empire reached such a high distinction. Zeno had Theoderic fight against Illus and the usurper Leontius, besieging them at Papurius in 484–488. However, in 486 Theoderic revolted again and attacked Constantinople, severing the city's water supply. Zeno bought a peace and agreed with Theoderic that the Ostrogoths should have gone to invade Italy and fight Odoacer, who had allegedly supported Leontius, and to establish his new kingdom there (487). This all but eliminated the Germanic presence in the east.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{ineffectiveness}} of prisons at preventing crime, the high costs of maintaining them, and the detrimental socio-economic effects of mass incarceration, many nations (e.g. Sweden, Germany, and the Netherlands) have been working towards policies of large-scale decarceration, addressing crime and violence with alternative strategies such as fines, community service, and restorative justice processes. In addition to moving towards a more wholistic style of punishment, Nordic Countries in particular are focusing their efforts on prevention. In Sweden local police now work with county government to target at-risk youths. Swedish children from dysfunctional homes are provided more education and after-school activities to try and keep them out <b>of</b> <b>trouble.</b> <b>In</b> addition, police in Nordic countries are less likely to arrest youth for minor violations of the law. If a teenager steals food from a grocery store, they are often given community service time.|$|E

[...] Lafayette, just twenty years old, was at first told that Deane had exceeded his authority in offering him a major general's commission, but offered to volunteer in the army at his own expense. [...] Washington and Lafayette took an instant liking to one another when they met, and Lafayette became one of Washington's most trusted generals and confidants. [...] Conway, on the other hand, did not think highly of Washington's leadership, and proved to be a source <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> the 1777 campaign season and its aftermath.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, even as {{the term}} came into wide use, there was {{disagreement}} about its exact meaning.

During the same period of time, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld later recalled, Arab leaders urged him to make sure the operation went quickly as they [...] "were worried about the 'Arab street' erupting in anger at the West's invasion of a Muslim country.

500|$|Her {{marriage}} to Ernst suffered a further blow in 1897, when Victoria {{returned home from}} a visit to her sister Queen Marie of Romania and reportedly caught Ernst {{in bed with a}} male servant.

[...] Queen Victoria was saddened when she heard <b>of</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>in</b> the marriage from Sir George Buchanan, her chargé d'affaires, but refused to consider permitting her grandchildren to divorce because of their daughter, Elisabeth. Efforts to rekindle the marriage failed and, when Queen Victoria died in January 1901, significant opposition {{to the end of the}} marriage was removed. The Supreme Court of Hesse dissolved the marriage on 21 December 1901. Ernst, who had at first resisted the divorce, came to believe it was the only possible step. [...] "Now that I am calmer I see the absolute impossibility of going on leading a life which was killing her and driving me nearly mad," [...] Ernst wrote to his elder sister Princess Louis of Battenberg. [...] "For to keep up your spirits and a laughing face while ruin is staring you in the eyes and misery is tearing your heart to pieces is a struggle which is fruitless. I only tried for her sake. If I had not loved her so, I would have given it up long ago." [...] Princess Louis later wrote that she was less surprised by the divorce than Ernst was. [...] "Though both had done their best to make a success of their marriage, it had been a failure ...heir characters and temperaments were quite unsuited to each other and I had noticed how they were gradually drifting apart." [...] The divorce of the reigning Grand Duke and Grand Duchess of Hesse caused scandal in the royal circles of Europe. Tsar Nicholas wrote to his mother that even death would have been better than [...] "the general disgrace of a divorce." ...|$|E
