5|$|The androids {{threaten}} to decapitate Reinette, but the Doctor on Arthur crashes through {{the mirror to}} save her. The androids give up and shut down when the Doctor tells them that they now cannot return to their ship to finish the repairs. Reinette tells the Doctor that she had her fireplace moved to Versailles {{in the hope that}} he would return. The Doctor finds that the fireplace is still an <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> window and uses it to return to the spaceship. He tells Reinette to pack a bag and prepare to leave. The Doctor returns to the fireplace seconds later but discovers that seven years have passed in Reinette's time. King Louis XV finds the Doctor, tells him that Reinette has died and gives him a letter in which Reinette expresses her hopes for the Doctor's quick return and confesses her love for him. The Doctor returns to the TARDIS and watches the time windows close before leaving the ship. The TARDIS crew muse about the reasons the androids wanted Madame de Pompadour's brain to complete their repairs, and the Doctor conjectures that the ship's memory banks were damaged by the ion storm. When the TARDIS dematerializes, a portrait can be seen stating the birth and death date of Madame de Pompadour. As the episode ends, the lifeless ship drifts through space; its name is SS Madame de Pompadour.|$|E
25|$|RHIC {{is now the}} second-highest-energy heavy-ion {{collider}} in the world. As of November 7, 2010, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has collided heavy ions of lead {{at higher}} energies than RHIC. The LHC <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> for ions (lead-lead and lead-proton collisions) is limited to about one month per year.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the longer}} <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> per year, {{a greater number}} of colliding ion species and {{collision}} energies can be studied at RHIC. In addition and unlike the LHC, RHIC is also able to accelerate spin polarized protons, which would leave RHIC as the world's highest energy accelerator for studying spin-polarized proton structure.|$|E
30|$|When {{comparing}} <b>operating</b> <b>times</b> between {{conventional and}} robot-assisted TLH, most {{studies have found}} shorter <b>operating</b> <b>times</b> in conventional TLH [10, 16 – 18, 20]. A Cochrane review conducted by Liu et al. concluded that moderate quality evidence exists for longer <b>operating</b> <b>times</b> in robot-assisted TLH [21]. This finding is based on two randomized controlled trials with in total 148 patients, which is half the population of our study [17, 19]. Other studies have also found shorter <b>operating</b> <b>times</b> in robot-assisted TLH [11, 16].|$|R
30|$|The <b>operating</b> <b>times</b> in {{our study}} {{correspond}} well with the literature [10, 11, 16]. Shorter <b>operating</b> <b>times</b> are reported as well, but they originate mostly from early adopters of robotic surgery or centers with more experience in laparoscopic hysterectomies [17 – 19].|$|R
30|$|With {{data from}} a {{prospective}} study we recorded the development of <b>operating</b> <b>times</b> from the first {{to the most recent}} robotic hysterectomy for 2 experienced gynecologists. Mean <b>operating</b> <b>times</b> for the first 5 (group 1) and the last 5 surgeries (group 2) were compared. Also development of docking times were recorded.|$|R
25|$|These {{issues are}} more {{difficult}} for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical pulse shaping. Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed {{much more quickly than}} the decoherence time.|$|E
25|$|The great {{disadvantage}} is {{the limited}} <b>operating</b> <b>time.</b> The jet of steam and oxygen can provide significant thrust from fairly lightweight rockets, but the jet has {{a relatively low}} exhaust velocity and hence a poor specific impulse. Currently, such rocket belts can only fly for about 30 seconds (because of the limited amount of fuel the user can carry unassisted).|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 2000, it had round trips between Amakusa Islands and Kumamoto twice a day. Starting from December 1, 2005, the <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> was {{extended}} from (8:00 am ～ 7:00 pm) to (7:40 am ～ 8:30 pm). It now has three round trips between Amakusa Airfield and Fukuoka Airport and one round trip between Amakusa Airfield and Kumamoto Airport (also one round trip between Kumamoto Airport and Kobe Airport) per day while using the same aircraft (aircraft registration number JA81AM). Since this airfield is served only by Amakusa Airlines and this airline only has one aircraft, the DHC-8 (pictured on the right) is the only regular, scheduled, aircraft that uses this airfield.|$|E

30|$|The {{learning}} curve supposedly {{is one of}} the advantages of robotics. To verify this we recorded the chronologic development of <b>operating</b> <b>times</b> from the first to the most recent robotic hysterectomy for 2 experienced gynecologists. The resulting {{learning curve}}s are well in agreement with learning curves from other robotics studies with plateaus between 20 – 50 cases at similar <b>operating</b> <b>times.</b>|$|R
25|$|Age {{of these}} units was {{significant}} for several reasons. All of the Phase I units were either built or under construction when the Clean Air Act of 1977 was enacted, and all but eight were built or under construction when the 1970 Act was enacted. Consequently, these units were built when labor costs were significantly less than in the 1990s, and they avoided major investments in pollution control equipment. In the 1990s, these units were often among the least expensive of any operated by their respective owners, in terms of cost per megawatt-hour of energy produced. Compared to other plants on a utility company system, these units provided incentives for their owners to maximize <b>operating</b> <b>time,</b> minimize downtime for repairs or retrofit, and minimize further capital investments in them.|$|E
25|$|Some {{advantages}} of the graft include less trauma to the leg that has undergone the ACL revision. Patients regain their range of motion and leg strength on the newly repaired ACL leg much quicker. The graft also allows for a bone-to-bone fixation which allows for more aggressive rehabilitation. The patient also eliminates the chance of any potential complications such as disease transmission that would be present if an allograph was chosen. The dis{{advantages of}} the graft include infection at this site, anterior knee pain, quadriceps muscle weakness, loss of motion, patella fracture, patellofemoral crepitus, patellar tendonitis, and patellofemoral joint pain. Also, {{it is not uncommon}} in certain patient populations to rupture the contralateral ACL following return to their sport. By harvesting the patellar tendon from the opposite knee, the orthopedic surgeon no longer has the option of using that patellar tendon for the reconstruction. It has been noted that a low percentage of patients have suffered a patellar tendon rupture in the first few weeks after surgery due to the increased stress to the area. In addition to a longer <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> the patient will have two scars instead of one.|$|E
25|$|Patients with {{thalassemia}} major {{are more}} inclined to have a splenectomy. The medical cases of splenectomies have been declining in recent years due to decreased prevalence of hypersplenism in adequately transfused patients. Patients with hypersplenism are inclined to have a lower amount of healthy blood cells in their body than normal and reveal symptoms of anemia. Iron rich patients need a splenectomy to reduce the probability of an iron overload. The different surgical techniques are the open and laparoscopic method. The laparoscopic method requires longer <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> but a shorter recovery period with no surgical scar. If it is unnecessary to remove the entire spleen a partial splenectomy may occur; this method preserves some of the immune function while reducing the probability of hypersplenism. Surgeons who chose Laparoscopic splenectomy must administer an appropriate immunization at least two weeks before the surgery. On the operating table the patient must be placed at a 30˚ to 40˚ position with his or her left arm elevated above the head to properly make the incision. The camera is inserted along with four other trocars: one placed in the left subcostal area, one inserted at the midpoint between the first and third, one 4cm right of the midline, and the fourth positioned on the midline to retract the spleen. Removing the spleen, an organ in under a person’s rib cage on the upper left side of its abdominal, allows the body to regulate the correct amount of healthy cells in the body.|$|E

500|$|The {{discovery}} {{in the late}} 1930s that vitaminK prevented bleeding with jaundice, {{and the development of}} blood transfusion as an everyday process, both improved post-operative survival, but about 25% of people never left hospital alive as late as the 1970s. In the 1970s a group of American surgeons wrote urging that the procedure was too dangerous and should be abandoned. [...] Since then outcomes in larger centers have improved considerably, and mortality from the operation is often less than 4%. [...] In 2006 a report was published of a series of 1,000 consecutive pancreaticoduodenectomies performed by a single surgeon from Johns Hopkins Hospital between 1969 and 2003. The rate of these operations had increased steadily over this period, with only three of them before 1980, and the median <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> reduced from 8.8hours in the 1970s to 5.5hours in the 2000s, and mortality within 30 days or in hospital was only 1%. [...] Another series of 2,050 operations at the Massachusetts General Hospital between 1941 and 2011 showed a similar picture of improvement.|$|E
500|$|The VRDK was a motorjet, a {{rudimentary}} type of jet engine where an external power source drove the engine's compressor. It forced {{air into the}} stainless steel combustion chamber where fuel was sprayed from seven nozzles and ignited to exhaust out the variable rear nozzle. In the I-250 a [...] Klimov VK-107R V-12 piston engine {{was used as the}} primary powerplant. After takeoff a clutch {{at the end of the}} crankshaft could be engaged which drove a step up gearbox with a ratio of 13:21 to an extension shaft that powered the compressor of the VRDK. The air for the compressor was fed through a long duct that ran from the inlet underneath the propeller spinner, thence under the engine and through the belly of the aircraft. This duct also fed air to the oil cooler near the engine, but the water radiator was positioned behind the compressor to maximize airflow over it. A secondary duct led from the main duct to the VK-107's supercharger; when the VRDK was running the secondary duct diverted some of that additional air to the supercharger which boosted the engine's output to [...] at [...] The increased airflow over the engine radiator helped to dump the engine's excess heat into the exhaust stream. However the VRDK was limited to only ten minutes' <b>operating</b> <b>time</b> per sortie, which meant that it was useless weight during the rest of the flight.|$|E

30|$|A {{different}} {{development of}} the learning curves for both surgeons was seen. This {{could be explained by}} a different absolute number of cases. Both flows are well in agreement with learning curves from other studies on the robotic approach with plateaus between 20 – 50 cases. Compared to other publications <b>operating</b> <b>times</b> for both surgeons are quite low due to the experience in laparoscopy. Thus potential for improvement is limited and <b>operating</b> <b>times</b> probably correlate to other factors like uterus size and technique.|$|R
