5|$|Physically, the {{cyclonic}} circulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> advects environmental air poleward east {{of center}} and equatorial west of center. Because air must conserve its angular momentum, this flow configuration induces a cyclonic gyre equatorward and westward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> center and an anticyclonic gyre poleward and eastward <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> center. The combined flow of these gyres acts to advect the storm slowly poleward and westward. This effect occurs {{even if there}} is zero environmental flow.|$|E

5|$|Around 0000UTC on September25, the {{disturbance}} was sufficiently organized to be declared a tropical depression. Shortly after, the NHC issued their first advisory {{on the system}} as it intensified into a tropical storm, assigning it the name Kyle. The center <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> was slightly elongated but moderate wind shear continued to impact the circulation. Kyle track northward {{in response to an}} area of high pressure east of Bermuda and an area of low pressure along the eastern United States. The sheared structure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> led to problems with recording the intensity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> throughout the day. Hurricane Hunters continuously flew into the storm to record information; however, their estimates were considered too high as the storm was disorganized.|$|E

5|$|As Linfa (locally {{known as}} Egay) {{approached}} {{closer to the}} Philippine island of Luzon, PAGASA issued Public Storm Warning Signal (PSWS) #2, expecting gale force-winds in Apayao, Aurora, Cagayan, northern Isabela, Kalinga, and Quirino, including the offshore Babuyan and Calayan islands. A lower PSWS was issued for other portions of Luzon. Ahead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> 45,336people evacuated in the Philippines, utilizing 31government shelters and assisted by police officers. Restricted travel by boat stranded 1,147people during the storm's passage. Due to the enhancement of the southwest monsoon by the storm, all ships in the Port of Manila were ordered to remain in harbor, and 20flights were cancelled in northern Luzon.

5|$|As {{early as}} September 13, {{residents}} were made {{aware that a}} storm might strike parts of Ireland with hurricane-force winds. Two days later, forecasters believed the storm would take a more southerly course towards France. This forecast was later withdrawn as the storm failed to turn eastward. Consequently, gale warnings were issued for much of western Ireland {{on the morning of}} September 16, hours before the brunt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> arrived. Fearing building collapses, officials in County Galway closed markets for the duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b>|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{relatively}} weak and disorganized nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> impact throughout its path was widespread, but not particularly severe. Puerto Rico bore the brunt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm,</b> followed by the United States Virgin Islands, then the Dominican Republic. Debby was attributed to about $735,000 in damage and 1indirect fatality, which occurred in Puerto Rico when a man fell off a roof while attempting to remove a satellite dish.|$|E
5|$|By 11 January, the Apache Corporation began {{evacuating}} all non-essential {{personnel from}} oil rigs {{in the path}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> The Rio Tinto Group shut down iron exports at its Dampier and Cape Lambert ports due to rough seas. Across the Pilbara region, the State Emergency Service advised residents to secure loose objects and ensure their emergency kits were stocked. Incident management teams were also established {{to help people in}} the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> Additionally, urban search and rescue equipment was set up in Karratha. Horizon Power dispatched additional linemen to the most at-risk areas in Narelle's path to speed up power restoration in the wake <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm.</b> In Carnarvon, mango producers picked as much of their fruit as possible before the storm arrived to minimise losses.|$|E

5|$|During Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, {{parts and}} {{remnants}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> reached Presque Isle. The park was closed in preparation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> and waves for 14 – 18 feet were called for, along with high winds. The storm {{was expected to}} be severe, but luckily was not. Only 8 foot waves were recorded and not as high of winds either. The park made it out with only minor flooding, a few downed trees, and the loss of power at the park marina.|$|E
5|$|For a given {{topography}} and bathymetry {{the surge}} height is not solely affected by peak wind speed; the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> also affects the peak surge.
