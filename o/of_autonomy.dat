40|$|This {{paper will}} {{investigate}} whether constraints on possible forms of limitation <b>of</b> the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> science {{can be derived}} from epistemological considerations. Proponents <b>of</b> the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> science often link autonomy with virtues such as epistemic fecundity, capacity to generate technological innovations and capacity to produce neutral expertise. I will critically discuss several important epistemological assumptions underlying these links, in particular the “unpredictability argument”. This will allow me to spell out conditions to be met by any form of limitation <b>of</b> the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> science to be epistemologically acceptable. These conditions can then be used as a framework to evaluate possible or existing forms of limitations <b>of</b> the <b>autonomy</b> <b>of</b> science. And it will turn out that the option of direct public participation (a lively option in philosophy of science today) might not {{be the best way to}} go to democratize the setting of research agenda...|$|R

Scores assigned range from zero to three. The PAS items gather information about the patient’s perception and awareness of his/her disability(ies) on admission and perception of his/her improvement at the end of a rehabilitation process. The PAS was administered to 127 inpatients on admission to and at discharge from a rehabilitation program. All 127 inpatients, recruited in a prospective multicenter study, completed the rehabilitation program. The statistical analysis identified a total of 38 items to be retained in the PAS, out of an initial 82 items. The results provide evidence of the validity and reliability of the PAS in its final version...|$|R

5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the shared ability of humans to reason should {{be the basis of}} morality, and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, {{believed that}} all humans {{should have the right to}} common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even if they were the patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> would mean that a patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient, so they must be informed of all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account <b>of</b> <b>autonomy</b> requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Kant's Formula <b>of</b> <b>Autonomy</b> {{expresses the}} idea that an agent is obliged to follow the Categorical Imperative because of their {{rational}} will, rather than any outside influence. Kant believed that any moral law motivated {{by the desire to}} fulfill some other interest would deny the Categorical Imperative, leading him to argue that the moral law must only arise from a rational will. This principle requires people to recognize the right of others to act autonomously and means that, as moral laws must be universalisable, what is required of one person is required of all.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims to explore Chinese learners' conceptions <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy</b> from learners' {{perspective}} since researchers in language education argue that concepts <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy</b> may bear cultural imprints and recent college English language education reform in China sets learner autonomy {{as a prime}} goal. The study first presents general background and {{an introduction to the}} research context. There follows a comprehensive literature review, tracking origins of the concept <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy</b> in the fields of philosophy, general education, and language education, with distinctive 'Western' and 'Chinese' emphases. This is followed by a review of relevant research on learner autonomy in language education, which consists of research on learner autonomy as a concept, as a means for effective learning, relationships with culture, and methodological issues. To investigate Chinese learners' conceptions <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy,</b> the study adopted a mixed research approach to collect data: with a qualitative method as the main research method to capture in-depth understandings of learners' conceptions, and a quantitative method as a supplementary one to support qualitative data findings {{and at the same time}} reveal further diversity. Moreover, to avoid any imposition <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy</b> theory pre-occupied in the researcher's mind, the study does not ask directly about learner autonomy to learners but instead examines whether concepts <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy</b> are embedded in students' accounts of successful English language learning. The study involved 27 interviews and a questionnaire survey of 450 college English language learners among three different Chinese universities. The main findings of the study are as follows: 1) Both 'Western' and 'Chinese' emphases and core elements <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy</b> are found in Chinese learners' conceptions of successful English language learning; 2) Chinese learners' conceptions <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy</b> are found to exist in two distinctive domains: learner autonomy for academic success (LAAS) and learner autonomy for communicative competence (LACC). 3) Learners' conceptions <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy</b> can be influenced by different sources: political, economical, social, cultural, and individual. 4) Learners' conceptions <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy</b> are dynamic, and subject to various factors such as progress of level of education and individual language learning experiences. Based on the data findings, a reconsideration of concepts <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy</b> drawn out from students' conceptions of successful English language learning is discussed, which combines 'Western', 'Chinese' emphases and core elements <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy,</b> associated behaviours, and sources of influences on them. This reconstruction of the concept <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy</b> in the Chinese context contributes to a better understanding <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy</b> theory. The research has important implications for policy makers, teachers, parents, and students in understanding learner autonomy from learners' perspectives and for research into concepts <b>of</b> learner <b>autonomy</b> in different contexts...|$|R
