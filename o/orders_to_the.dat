5|$|Beaty {{continued}} to distinguish {{himself in the}} 5th Regiment's further engagements. His actions during the Battle of Fair Oaks & Darbytown Road in October 1864 earned him a mention in the general <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Army of the Potomac. The regimental commander, Colonel Giles Shurtleff, twice recommended him for a promotion to commissioned officer. Nothing came of Colonel Shurtleff's requests, however Beaty did receive a brevet promotion to lieutenant. By {{the time he was}} mustered out of the Army he had participated in thirteen battles and numerous skirmishes.|$|E
5|$|German Army {{headquarters}} {{wanted to}} capture the bridges over the Drava intact, and from 1 April had issued <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> German 2nd Army to conduct preliminary operations aimed at seizing the bridge at Barcs and the railway bridge at Gyékényes by coup de main. As a result, limited objective attacks were launched {{along the line of}} the Drava by the XLVI Motorised Corps, {{despite the fact that they}} were not expected to launch offensive operations until 10 April.|$|E
5|$|In an {{adjacent}} sector, a short truce {{to bury the}} dead between the lines led to official repercussions; a company commander, Sir Iain Colquhoun of the Scots Guards, was court-martialled for defying standing <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contrary. While he was found guilty and reprimanded, the punishment was annulled by General Haig and Colquhoun remained in his position; the official leniency may perhaps have been because he was related to H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|On 30 May, the Ministry of National Security of Azerbaijan {{announced}} that they had thwarted a series of planned terror attacks against the Eurovision Song Contest, among the targets being Baku Crystal Hall, as well as Marriott and Hilton hotels in Baku. On 22 August, The Daily Telegraph reported that according to Western intelligence services, Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei personally gave <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> elite Quds Force unit to launch terrorist attacks against the West and its allies, including Azerbaijan during the Eurovision Song Contest.|$|E
5|$|The upper classes' {{need for}} a cheap and {{plentiful}} labor force, the instinctive willingness of the clergy of the state church to discourage emigration on both moral and social grounds, and the deference of the lower <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> arcade of powers that hovered above them—all these things formed an architecture of cultural hesitancy concerning emigration.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} kinds of Red and White {{political}} violence: (i) a calculated {{part of the general}} warfare, (ii) local, personal murders and corresponding acts of revenge. In the former, the high staffs planned and organized the actions and gave <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lower level; at least a third of the Red terror and most of the White terror was centrally led. At first the Red and White governments officially opposed political violence, but the operational decisions were made at the military level.|$|E

5|$|While {{wandering}} fields, towers, caves, seas, and dungeons, {{the player}} randomly encounters monsters, {{after which the}} game shifts to battle mode. The game's battle mode introduces groups of monsters, which is an upgrade from the one-on-one battles of Dragon Quest. In the battle mode, the player gives <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> characters on how to fight the monsters. Once the player defeats all of the monsters, the characters gain experience points and gold. The experience points raise the characters' experience levels. This improves the characters' attributes, and they may also learn new spells.|$|E
5|$|A {{report by}} Rundstedt to Hitler in October 1943 {{regarding}} the weak defences in France {{led to the}} appointment of Rommel to oversee the construction of further fortifications along the expected invasion-front, which stretched from the Netherlands to Cherbourg. Rommel was given command of the newly re-formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands. Nazi Germany's tangled command structure {{made it difficult for}} Rommel to achieve his task. He was not allowed to give <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Organisation Todt, which was commanded by armaments minister Albert Speer, so in some places he had to assign soldiers to do construction work.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{condition}} of the northerly pass it was decided to leave divisional artillery to follow in the morning, guarded by the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade. So it was that only the 13th and 14th Cavalry Brigades of the 5th Cavalry Division which entered the Esdraelon Plain on the morning of 20 September. Despite <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> contrary, the 14th Cavalry Brigade advanced directly towards Afulah, the objective of the 4th Cavalry Division. Only the 13th Cavalry Brigade was therefore available to attack 5th Cavalry Division's objective at Nazareth. This brigade was not sufficiently strong to capture the town and the Yildirim Army Group headquarters and Liman von Sanders escaped. The next day, after the German and Ottoman garrison had retreated, Nazareth was occupied by the 13th Cavalry Brigade.|$|E

5|$|Combat in Mass Effect is squad-based and two squad members {{accompany}} the {{player on the}} battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Battles take place in real-time, but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different talent abilities for the squad members to use. The game uses an over the shoulder perspective akin to a third-person shooter, and features a cover system which allows players to strategically hide behind objects while fighting enemy forces. The player may also issue <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> squad members, such as sending them to take cover behind an object, scout ahead, regroup, or focus their fire on a designed target.|$|E
5|$|German Army {{headquarters}} {{wanted to}} capture the bridges over the Drava intact, and from 1 April had issued <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Army to conduct preliminary operations aimed at seizing the bridge at Barcs and the railway bridge northeast of Koprivnica by coup de main. As a result, limited objective attacks were launched {{along the line of}} the Drava by the XLVI Motorised Corps, {{despite the fact that they}} were not expected to launch offensive operations until 10 April. During the day, the German Luftwaffe bombed and strafed Yugoslav positions and troops on the march, and by the evening it had become clear to the Germans that the Yugoslavs would not be resisting stubbornly at the border. XLVI Motorised Corps was then ordered to begin seizing bridges over the Drava, including at Barcs. The local attacks were sufficient to inflame dissent among the Croat troops of the 4th Army, who refused to resist Germans they considered their liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period.|$|E

5|$|He {{then made}} way to Egypt, {{arriving}} to a tumultuous reception in January AD 19. He had gone there to relieve a famine {{in the country}} vital to Rome's food supply. The move upset Tiberius, because it had violated an order by Augustus that no senator shall enter the province without consulting the emperor and the Senate (Egypt was an imperial province, and belonged to the emperor). He returned to Syria by summer, where he found that Piso had either ignored or revoked his <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cities and legions. Germanicus in turn ordered Piso's recall to Rome, although this action was probably beyond his authority.|$|E
5|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{precisely}} why Steuart {{was reluctant to}} pursue Banks' defeated army more vigorously, and contemporary records shed little light on the matter. It may be that his thirteen years' training as a cavalry officer led him to obey <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> letter, {{with little or no}} room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process. No charges were brought against him however, despite Jackson's reputation as a stern disciplinarian. It is possible that Jackson's leniency {{had to do with the}} strong desire of the Confederacy to recruit Marylanders to the Southern cause, and the need to avoid offending Marylanders who might be tempted to join Lee's army.|$|E
5|$|Luna also formed {{other units}} {{similar to the}} sharpshooters. One would be the unit, which would later be named after Bugallón, {{commanded}} by Rosendo Simón de Pajarillo. The unit emerged {{from a group of}} ten men wanting to volunteer in the regular Filipino army. Luna, still thinking of the defeat at the Battle of Caloocan, sent the men away at first. However, he soon changed his mind and decided to give the men an initiation. After taking breakfast, he ordered a subordinate, Colonel Queri, to prepare arms and ammunition for the ten men. Then, the men boarded a train destined towards Malinta, which was American-held territory. After giving <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> men, he let them go and watched them with his telescope. The men, succeeding their mission, eventually returned unharmed. Admiring their bravery, he organized them into a guerrilla unit of around 50 members. This unit would see action in the Second Battle of Caloocan.|$|E

5|$|On 8 June 1940, the Yugoslav Supreme Command {{had issued}} <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> 4th Army District {{headquarters}} {{to make all}} necessary preparations for defence and demolitions and ordered a 14-day exercise for border troops. 4th Army District headquarters submitted a progress report on this work on 30 January 1941. This report indicated that along the Hungarian border, bunkers and trenches had been constructed for the immediate defence of the Drava along the Yugoslav-Hungarian border, in particular at Varaždin, Koprivnica, Virovitica and Slatina, but no obstacles such as barbed wire entanglements or anti-tank ditches had been developed.|$|E
5|$|Samson, {{in earlier}} drafts also called Edgar Leiber or Edgar Leonhardt, is the dwarf {{co-manager}} of the Carnivàle. His original biography gave his {{background as a}} dwarf strongman who started his career in 1904. Eight years later, he started working on traveling carnivals, including the Hyde&Teller Company. Samson's wit elevated him from performer to general manager until another character, Management, purchased the carnival (to be renamed Carnivàle) and briefly gave Samson's job to Lodz, a blind mentalist. The beginning of the series shows Samson delegating Management's <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> carnies. Samson temporarily loses his position to Lodz {{for a second time}} {{near the end of the}} first season but retains Management's trust. The death of Management in season 2 leads to Samson's secret deal with Ben to make the boy the new commander of the carnival.|$|E
5|$|The Greek forces were, {{as agreed}} by the Allied congress, under the overall command of Spartan royalty {{in the person of}} Pausanias, who was the regent for Leonidas' young son, Pleistarchus, his cousin. Diodorus tells us that the Athenian {{contingent}} was under the command of Aristides; it is probable that the other contingents also had their leaders. Herodotus tells us in several places that the Greeks held council during the prelude to the battle, implying that decisions were consensual and that Pausanias did not have the authority to issue direct <b>orders</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other contingents. This style of leadership contributed to the way events unfolded during the battle itself. For instance, in the period immediately before the battle, Pausanias was unable to order the Athenians to join up with his forces, and thus the Greeks fought the battle completely separated from each other.|$|E
