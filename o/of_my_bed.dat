[...] He planned to teach full-time at the Silverlake Conservatory of Music, but ultimately decided to remain within the band. Flea later stated that [...] "the most painful part of quitting, and the thing that stopped me, was the idea of telling Anthony." ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{amid the}} New Woman and burgeoning suffragist {{movements}} that, in 1908, O'Neill began {{to concentrate on}} producing original artwork, and {{it was during this}} period that she created the whimsical Kewpie characters for which she became known. Their name, [...] "Kewpie", derives from Cupid, the Roman god of love. According to O'Neill, she became obsessed with the idea of the cherubic characters, to the point that she had dreams about them: [...] "I thought about the Kewpies so much that I had a dream about them where they were all doing acrobatic pranks on the coverlet <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed.</b> One sat in my hand." [...] She described them as [...] "a sort of little round fairy whose one idea is to teach people to be merry and kind at the same time". The Kewpie characters made their debut in comic strip form in 1909 in an issue of Ladies' Home Journal. Further publications of the Kewpie comics in Woman's Home Companion and Good Housekeeping helped the cartoon grow in popularity rapidly.|$|E
500|$|It {{was about}} {{two in the morning}} of August 27 that I was awakened by seeing a soldier at the side <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed.</b> I got up and dressed and went down to the barroom, where I saw my father {{standing}} in one corner with three British soldiers before him with muskets and bayonets fixed. The army was then lying in the field in front of the house.... General Howe and another officer were in the barroom. General Howe wore a camlet cloak over his regimentals. After asking for a glass of liquor from the bar, which was given him, he entered into familiar conversation with my father, and among other things said, [...] "I must have some one of you to show me over the Rockaway Path around the pass." [...] My father replied, [...] "We belong to the other side, General, and can’t serve you against our duty." [...] General Howe replied, [...] "That is alright; stick to your country, or stick to your principles, but Howard, you are my prisoner and must guide my men over the hill." [...] My father made some further objection, but was silenced by the general, who said, [...] "You have no alternative. If you refuse I shall shoot you through the head." ...|$|E

"After I had {{bundled in}} my things somehow I struck a match {{and had a}} {{dazzling}} glimpse <b>of</b> <b>my</b> berth; then I pitched the roll <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>bedding</b> into the bunk but took no trouble to spread it out. I wasn't sleepy now, neither was I tired. And the thought that I {{was done with the}} earth for many many months to come made me feel very quiet and self-contained as it were. Sailors will understand what I mean." ...|$|R
60|$|A most {{beautiful}} summer morning succeeded, and after breakfast {{we went out}} arm in arm to see the house of which I was to give my mighty housekeeping opinion. We entered a flower-garden by a gate in a side wall, {{of which he had}} the key, and the first thing I saw was that the beds and flowers were all laid out according to the manner <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>beds</b> and flowers at home.|$|R

2500|$|Adele {{had said}} that she began writing it on her {{acoustic}} guitar {{in the wake of}} the break-up of her 18-month relationship with the 30-year-old man she thought she would marry. A few months after their split, he was engaged to someone else. [...] "We were so intense I thought we would get married. But that was something he never wanted... So when I found out he does want that with someone else, it was just the horrible-est feeling ever. But after I wrote it, I felt more at peace. It set me free... I didn't think it would resonate... with the world! I'm never gonna write a song like that again. I think that's the song I'll be known for." [...] She also said that [...] "I wrote that song on the end <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed.</b> I had a cold. I was waiting for my bath to run. I'd found out that he'd got engaged to someone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Charles Saatchi, who {{was best}} known as the most high-profile, high-spending {{collector}} of contemporary British art, bought My Bed (1998) for £150,000 ($248,000) from Lehmann Maupin's [...] "Every Part of Me's Bleeding," [...] the exhibition that won the artist a nomination for the 1999 Turner Prize. In 2013, on the occasion of a Christie's London sale that raised a total of 3.1million pounds ($5million) in aid of the Saatchi Gallery's policy of free entry, To Meet My Past (2002) sold for $778,900, establishing a new record for the artist. At another Christie's auction in 2014, My Bed was sold to White Cube founding director Jay Jopling for 2.5million pounds, including buyer's commission, once again to benefit the Saatchi Gallery's foundation. It was estimated that the price <b>of</b> <b>My</b> <b>Bed</b> would sell between 800,000 and 1.2 million pounds. Before the sale, Emin said that [...] "what I would really love is that someone did buy it and they donated it to the Tate." ...|$|E
2500|$|I was {{operated}} on that afternoon. As soon as I woke the surgeon, John Bartlett, {{was sitting on}} the end <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>bed</b> to tell me the bi-op was malignant... John found it hard to tell me and I found it hard to accept... I had to ring Mum and Dad in Deniliquin to tell them there was some bad news. Somehow you float through it even though you are scared s---less... The hardest part is the initial part, once you know what's in front of you it gets better. I don't want to trivialise cancer in any way. You have to let the emotion out then sit down and become realistic ... I never asked if my life was in the balance. My parents taught me, my school taught me, sport taught me but in particular cancer taught me that trust is the most powerful emotion we have. I trusted my doctors and nurses implicitly. It was amazing what I learnt about the power of the mind and how important trust is... There were the [...] "how in the hell did I get it?" [...] moments. No one knows, it could have been getting hit in a footy game or a cricket ball 10 years earlier.|$|E
