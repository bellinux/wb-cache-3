40|$|ABSTRACT: Fluctuations in raw {{material}} and product prices have caused manufacturers and consumers to experience serious losses in steel sector {{as well as}} in all other sectors. As the number of manufacturers of commodities like coking coal, iron ore and scrap- the main {{raw material}}s of steel manufacturing- is less worldwide and their manufacturers do not want to disclose price in an organized market, their future transaction volumes have not developed sufficiently yet. However, future transaction volumes of <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> like aluminum, tin etc. that are used as auxiliary raw materials in steel manufacturing have increased fast in organized markets and such style of future transactions have become important in steel manufacturing in terms of cost management. The London Metal Exchange, one of the leading future commodity markets of world, has an important place in management of price risk in steel manufacturing and consumption of derivative transaction contracts. In this study, causality relationship between the price series of <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals</b> used as raw materials in steel manufacturing is examined by using Toda and Yamamoto (1995) causality test procedure.

40|$|In this study, the dioxins {{emissions}} from 51 countries were investigated by multivariate statistical analysis, and {{the correlations between}} dioxins emissions and some aspects of human activities were discussed at national scale. For the 51 countries mentioned in this paper, the total emissions are 36. 0 kg-TEQ yr(- 1), and the average values of annual dioxins emissions (from 2000 to 2007) per capita and per unit GDP are calculated to be 18. 3 g-TEQ million-people(- 1) yr(- 1) and 6. 7 g-TEQ billion-USD(- 1) yr(- 1), respectively. Furthermore, as the three leading industrial emission sources of dioxins, power generation and heating, ferrous and <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>production</b> and waste incineration contribute 45. 1 % to the total emission in all.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{information on}} atmospheric emissions during {{the production of}} copper in primary smelters. More than 80 copper smelters around the world employ various conventional pyrometallurgical techniques to produce more than 90 % of the total copper production (e. g. Pacyna, 1989). Generally there are 3 steps in this process: 1) roasting of ores to remove sulphur, 2) smelting of roaster product to remove {{a part of the}} gangue for production of the copper matte, and 3) converting of the copper matte to blister copper. Atmospheric emissions of sulphur dioxide and heavy metals on fine particles occur during all the above mentioned processes. Both emissions from fuel combustion in the primary copper plants and industrial processes are discussed here. 2 CONTRIBUTIONS TO TOTAL EMISSIONS Emissions of sulphur dioxide from <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>production,</b> particularly copper production contribute less than 10 % to the total global emissions of this pollutant. However, copper smelting can be the most important source of sulphur dioxide emissions in certain regions, such as the Kola Peninsula, the Urals, the Norilsk area, and the Fergana region in Russia, Lower Silesia in Poland, and the Gijon region in Spain.

40|$|The {{development}} of strategies and policies aiming at {{the reduction of}} environmental exposure to air pollution requires the assessment of historical emissions. Although anthropogenic emissions from the extended territory of the Soviet Union (SU) considerably influenced concentrations of heavy metals in the Northern Hemisphere, Pb is the only metal with long-term historical emission estimates for this region available, whereas for selected other metals only single values exist. Here we present the first study assessing long-term Cd, Cu, Sb, and Zn emissions in the SU during the period 1935 – 1991 based on ice-core concentration records from Belukha glacier in the Siberian Altai and emission data from 12 regions in the SU for the year 1980. We show that Zn primarily emitted from the Zn production in Ust-Kamenogorsk (East Kazakhstan) dominated the SU heavy metal emission.

It produces nickel, copper and <b>other</b> <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metals.</b> The study sites were located at 4 – 30 km from the local source of industrial pollution.

The results of the chemical analysis of organs and tissue samples of small rodents, their morpho-physiological and genetic characteristics within emission plume were analysed. The abundance of the studied Mammalia species was the lowest at 5 km north and 7 km south of the metallurgical industrial complex. According to our results, animals in a zone of increased industrial emission (sulfur dioxide, compounds of heavy metals) concentrations had more deviations from the biological norms in comparison with the same species from less polluted areas. Long-term (1936 – 2014) abundance dynamics of Clethrionomys glareolus was presented due to the new ecological situation in the region and reduction of the volume of sulfur dioxide emission by the Severonikel' industrial complex.

40|$|This {{working paper}} {{describes}} those determinants of intrasectoral change within the sector of <b>non-ferrous</b> <b>metal</b> <b>production</b> in the Ruhr Area, Northrhine-Westfalia, which {{contributed to the}} reduction of atmospheric heavy metal emissions since the mid-sixties, {{as well as the}} driving forces behind these intrasectoral changes. It constitutes part of the Rhine/Black Triangle Policy Comparison Study at IIASA. Intrasectoral changes pertaining to the emission of atmospheric heavy metals are shown to have consisted, in the first place, of process changes whose main characteristic was increased processing of production residues, i. e. a closing of economic (material) cycles, thus increasing recycling and decreasing waste. The second most important development was the application of gradually improved off-gas collection and cleaning technologies (end-of-pipe technologies). Closures of old plants also have contributed to the decrease in heavy metal emissions. Although capacities were increased during the period of the investigation (1955 to 1988), these capacity increases were brought about with modernized technologies, which are less emission intensive than those used in the older plants. Three major factors were the driving forces behind the intrasectoral change: developments in legal requirements (air pollution control); economic motivations of the enterprises; and financial support from public institutions. An open question is whether various residues resulting from the more modern processing technologies are, from an environmental point of view, more hazardous than heavy metal emissions...|$|R
