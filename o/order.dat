5|$|A {{mandatory}} <b>order</b> is an <b>order</b> of the High Court commanding {{a public}} authority {{to perform a}} public duty, while a prohibiting <b>order</b> operates to prevent illegal action by an authority from occurring in the first place. A quashing <b>order,</b> the most commonly sought prerogative <b>order,</b> {{has the effect of}} invalidating an ultra vires decision made by an authority. Obtaining a mandatory, prohibiting or quashing <b>order</b> is a two-stage process, as an applicant must be granted leave by the Court to apply for the <b>order.</b> The Court must find the existence of a proper public law issue and available grounds of review. Leave will be granted provided that an arguable and prima facie case of reasonable suspicion that the authority has acted in breach of administrative law rules is established.|$|E
5|$|A {{mandatory}} <b>order</b> is an <b>order</b> of the High Court which commands {{a public}} body {{to perform a}} public duty, and is usually employed to compel public bodies to exercise the powers given to them. It {{may be used in}} combination with another remedy, most commonly a quashing <b>order.</b> In such a case, the quashing <b>order</b> will set aside the unlawful decision, and the mandatory <b>order</b> will require the public body to reconsider the matter. A person who complies with a mandatory <b>order</b> cannot have legal proceedings taken against him or her for doing so.|$|E
5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, {{an expert on}} Canada's honours, raised the concern that the three grades of the <b>Order</b> of Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the <b>order,</b> equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. The <b>order</b> of precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the <b>Order</b> of Canada supersede the top levels {{of each of the}} other orders (except the <b>Order</b> of Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E

5|$|By 1957, {{the arms}} were redrawn by Alan Beddoe {{so as to}} have red leaves and to change the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more {{resembling}} St. Edward's Crown, as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II. To mark the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended {{the last vestiges of}} British authority over Canada, a McGill University student named Bruce Hicks proposed to Secretary of State Gerald Regan that the motto of the <b>Order</b> of Canada be placed around the shield in <b>order</b> to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national <b>order</b> of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the <b>Order</b> of the Garter), the Scottish royal arms the <b>Order</b> of the Thistle, and the royalist arms of the French Regime the <b>Order</b> of the Holy Spirit and <b>Order</b> of Saint Michael). While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the <b>Order</b> of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the <b>Order</b> of Canada.|$|E
