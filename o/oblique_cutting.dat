Biopsy needle tip cutting edge geometry is defined using analytical models. With these geometrical definitions a mechanistic force model is developed to predict the needle insertion force for a given needle geometry. The force model then leads {{to the development of}} the improved ECE needle tip geometry. Needle biopsy is one of the most common medical procedures to cut and remove tissue for pathological diagnosis. Currently little study has focused on hollow needle tissue cutting. This lack of knowledge has led to the use of biopsy needles and devices that are inefficient at cutting tissue, thereby hindering the accuracy of the diagnosis, increasing the discomfort to the patient, and lengthening the procedure time. This dissertation directly fills this void in hollow needle tissue cutting knowledge to improve the yield of biopsy and advance the understanding of hollow needle tissue cutting in biopsy. This study is conducted in four topics that build on each other to reach the ultimate goal of developing the novel ECE biopsy needle. First, analytical models of needle geometry are developed for identification of inclination angle, normal rake angle, needle tip insertion length, and needle tip area on a variety of flat plane and curved needle tips. Second, <b>oblique</b> tissue <b>cutting</b> is studied through blade and needle tissue cutting experiments and three analytical models are developed to describe tissue flow angle and needle contact length. Third, a general hollow needle insertion force model is developed to predict needle insertion force. Fourth, a novel ECE needle tip is developed based on positive geometrical characteristics discovered by the force model for cutting tissue. This ECE needle is validated against a regular style needle and shown to produce longer biopsy sample lengths. This research aims to improve the procedure of needle biopsy through increasing fundamental knowledge in needle cutting mechanics and developing the improved needle geometry of the ECE needle.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{process of}} metal cutting {{is a subject}} of great {{importance}} to the makers and users of machine tools. Extensive research has gone into the subject but has still left most of the phenomena unexplained. Tool life is the main interest and before any real improvement in this factor can be made, the basic metallurgical factors governing the interaction between tool and workpiece must be better understood. Such improvement can be effected through control of the wear process since both tool and workpiece are metallic and machining {{is a process of}} metal flow which is associated with a serious wear problem. The absence of exact knowledge has however hampered empirical and mathematical approaches to the problem. Basically all machining operations are considered as either <b>oblique</b> or orthogonal <b>cutting,</b> the former requiring three dimensions to specify the geometry of the cutting part of the tool and the latter two. The basic metal cutting process to be considered is that which is common, in one form or another, to all metal cutting operations using a tool, that of the wedge-shaped tool in fig. 1 (a-j) (1). Analyses of cutting have been mainly concentrated on the relatively simple case of orthogonal or two-dimensional cutting. Here the tool is so set that its cutting edge is perpendicular to the direction of relative motion between tool and workpiece and generates a plane parallel to the original work surface. In doing this the tool removes a layer of material termed the chip. One of the major objectives of metal cutting theory is the determination of machining forces, chip geometry, tool life, energy consumption and surface finish from a knowledge of the physical properties of the workpiece and tool material and the cutting conditions alone. If this could be achieved, lengthy chip measurements, delicate dynamometry, tedious and costly tool life tests and surface finish measurements might be dispensed with...|$|R

40|$|Classical {{orthogonal}} and <b>oblique</b> <b>cutting</b> are {{the fundamental}} material removal or machining processes to which other practical machining processes {{can be related}} {{in the study and}} modelling of the machining processes. In the last century, a large amount of research and development work has been done to study and understand the various machining processes with a view to improving the processes for further economic (cost and productivity) gains. However, many aspects of the cutting processes and cutting performance remains to be fully understood in order to increase the cutting capability and optimize the cutting processes; in particular, there is little study to understand the effects of the inevitable tool wear on the machining processes. This thesis includes an extensive literature review on the mechanics of cutting analysis. Considerable work has been carried out in past decades on the fundamental analysis of 'sharp' tool cutting. Although some work has been reported on the effects of tool flank wear on the cutting performance, there is a general lack of the fundamental study {{of the effects of the}} flank wear on the basic cutting or chip formation process. It has been well documented that tool flank wear results in an increase in the cutting forces. However, it was not known if this force increase is a result of the change in the chip formation process, and/or the rubbing or ploughing forces between the tool flank and the workpiece. In work carried out since the early 1980 s, the effects of the so-called edge forces have been considered when the tool is not absolutely sharp. Little has been reported to further develop fundamental cutting theories to understand applications to more relevant the practical situation, i. e. to consider the tool wear effects. Based on the findings of the literature review, an experimental investigation is presented in the first part of the thesis to study the effects of tool flank wear on the basic cutting or chip formation process by examining the basic cutting variables and performance in the orthogonal cutting process with tool flank wear. The effects of tool flank wear on the basic cutting variables are discussed by a comprehensive analysis of the experimental data. It has been found that tool flank wear does not affect the basic cutting variables (i. e. shear angle, friction angle and shear stress). It is therefore deduced that the flank wear does not affect the basic chip formation process in the shear zone and in the tool-chip interface. The study also finds that tool flank wear causes an increase in the total cutting forces, as can be expected and such an increase is entirely a result of the rubbing or ploughing forces on the tool wearland. The significance of this finding is that the well-developed machining theories for 'sharp' tools can be used in modelling the machining processes when tool flank wear is present, rather than study the machining process and develop machining theories from scratch. The ploughing forces can be modelled for incorporation into the overall cutting force prediction. The experimental study also allows for the forces on the wearland (or wearland force) and edge forces to be separated from the total measured forces. The wearland force and edge force models are developed in empirical form for force prediction purpose. In addition, a database for the basic cutting variables or quantities is established for use in modelling the cutting forces. The orthogonal cutting force model allowing for the effects of flank wear is developed and verified by the experimental data. A comprehensive analysis of the mechanics of cutting in the <b>oblique</b> <b>cutting</b> process is then carried out. Based on this analysis, predictive cutting force models for <b>oblique</b> <b>cutting</b> allowing for the effects of flank wear are proposed. The wearland force and edge force are re-considered by analysing the <b>oblique</b> <b>cutting</b> process and the geometrical relation. The predictive force models are qualitatively and quantitatively assessed by <b>oblique</b> <b>cutting</b> tests. It shows that the model predictions are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. The modelling approach is then used to develop the cutting force models for a more general machining process, turning operation. By using the concept of an equivalent cutting edge, the tool nose radius is allowed for under both orthogonal and <b>oblique</b> <b>cutting</b> conditions. The wearland forces and edge forces are taken into consideration by the integration of elemental forces on the tool flank and the cutting edge, respectively. The cutting forces in turning operations are successfully predicted by using the basic cutting quantity database established in the orthogonal cutting analysis. The models are verified by turning operation tests. It shows that the model predictions are in excellent agreement with the experimental results both qualitatively and quantitatively. The major findings, research impacts and practical implications of the research are finally highlighted in the conclusion. The modelling approach considering the flank wear effects in the classical orthogonal and <b>oblique</b> <b>cutting</b> and turning operations can be readily extended to other machining operations, such as drilling and milling...|$|E

The modeling touches on such researches as into experimental relationship between cutting force and cutting load on tool-chip friction interface, equivalent transformation of radius cutting edge, transformation between orthogonal cutting and 3 D cutting, and calculating cutting force coefficient. The model has realized the transformation from orthogonal cutting to <b>oblique</b> <b>cutting,</b> then to 3 D cutting, which can make calculation results of all parameters in orthogonal cutting model transplant into complex 3 D cutting. The experiments indicate accuracy and effectiveness of the cutting force prediction mode...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{intention}} {{of this research}} is to test the applicability of <b>oblique</b> <b>cutting</b> tools for improving surface textures produced in turning operations on parts made of popular steels (carbon, low- and high-alloy) with different chemical compositions and microstructures as well as P-F ductile iron. The aim of the research is to quantify the surface roughness and lays produced under practical working conditions. Design/methodology/approach: The objectives were achieved by the characterization of machined surfaces using 2 D and 3 D scanning techniques and typical LOM examinations. The surface profile and surface topographies were characterized and compared for optimal machining conditions. Findings: This investigation confirms that oblique machining allows producing surfaces with lower surface roughness and, in some cases, with attractive service properties. The main conclusion is that <b>oblique</b> <b>cutting</b> operations can reduce machining times and partly eliminate grinding operations, especially in the machining of hardened materials. Research limitations/implications: The basic limitations concern the measurement of residual stresses and microstructural alterations. Another important problem is to optimize the surface integrity including surface roughness and sublayer properties. Practical implications: One practical outcome is selecting the machining conditions which guarantee the demanded surface finish together with bearing properties. In particular, surfaces with characteristic plateau can be produced instead of special abrasive finishing operations. Originality/value: Original value of the paper is the presentation of new cutting tools and their effects in turning operations. Experiments were performed under the conditions combining low surface roughness with attractive service properties. This knowledge can support the design of technological processes of steel and NDI parts...|$|E
40|$|<b>Oblique</b> <b>cutting</b> {{tests of}} wood, by feeding a knife into a {{workpiece}} during the sliding {{of the knife}} parallel to the cutting edge, were performed (Fig. 1). Air dried specimens of sugi and white seraya, which were fixed to the experimental apparatus equipped with a three-dimensional elastic-ring dynamometer, were cut. The normal (N) and frictional (F) forces of the cutting force acting on the rake face were measured. Using these components, the frictional coefficient (μ) on the rake face was calculated by μ=F/N. The effects of the ratio (f) of the sliding velocity (V_k) to the feeding velocity (V_w), at various inclination angles (i_k) of the knife, on N, F, and μ were clarified...|$|E
