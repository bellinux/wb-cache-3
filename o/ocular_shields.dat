40|$|This chapter aims {{to provide}} the readers a {{comprehensive}} review of the current trends and approaches used in the development of ocular drug delivery systems. After the introduction to the topic, the chapter begins with {{a brief description of the}} common anatomical and physiological factors that are barriers to ocular drug transport and presents a persistent challenge to the development of formulations targeted to ophthalmic tissues. Further, traditional as well as relatively newer approaches used in the development of ocular formulations are discussed. Approaches such as viscosity modifiers, penetration enhancers, liposomal delivery, niosomes, microemulsions, prodrugs, and nanotechnology-derived approaches are extensively reviewed. These approaches are described with respect to the materials, formulation development, formulation performance, relative advantages and drawbacks, and recent advances in the technology. Additionally, the design approaches for the modified ocular drug delivery such as ocular implants, inserts, lenses, and <b>ocular</b> <b>shields</b> are described with respect to the formulation development. Finally, ocular drug delivery systems that are relatively newer or employed less frequently such as intravitreal injections, ocular iontophoresis, etc. are discussed. All approaches described are supported with relevant examples and up-to-date literature reports...|$|E
50|$|An <b>ocular</b> <b>shield</b> {{covers the}} eye. The eyes are small, {{diameter}} {{not more than}} half the length of the <b>ocular</b> <b>shield.</b> The tail is laterally compressed. The terminal scute also is laterally compressed, with two superposed points. The points are simple, bifid, or trifid.|$|R
50|$|Chirindia {{are small}} and slender. For example, the holotype of C. swynnertoni is 13.5 cm long, with the tail 1.4 cm, and the body is 3 mm in diameter. They are uniformly, unpigmented flesh-coloured, tinged with purplish, and have minute teeth. They usually lack an <b>ocular</b> <b>shield,</b> and each eye is {{situated}} under the posterior {{part of a large}} fused shield, that combines the nasal, second and sometimes first upper labial, prefrontal and sometimes the <b>ocular</b> <b>shield</b> into one, so as to cover all of one side of the snout.|$|R

40|$|Background: Treatment of dry eye {{involves}} the use of artificial tears to reduce the symptoms and signs of the condition. These lubricants often provide short-term symptomatic relief but their effect is limited by their brief retention time on the ocular surface. Recently, a new artificial tear, Systane ® Lubricant Eye Drops, has been introduced with the goal of providing greater patient relief by means of longer retention time on the ocular surface and formation of an <b>ocular</b> <b>shield</b> to promote epithelial repair. Methods: A total of 197 patients with a diagnosis of moderate to severe dry eye were enrolled at 21 sites across Canada. Patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms associated with dry eye at baseline. They were then treated with Systane Lubricant Eye Drops (Alcon Canada, Inc.) q. i. d. for 28 days. Patients were re-examined on Day 28. On both visits, corneal and conjunctival staining were assessed for both eyes, and tear film break-up time was measured. Subjects were asked to rate the severity of six ocular discomfort scores on a four-point scale. At the end of the study, patients completed an eight-point questionnaire in which they rated their response to Systane. Results: There was a highly significant reduction in corneal staining after 28 days of Systane use. Eighty-three percent of patient...|$|R

40|$|Monocelis lineata is {{a complex}} of cryptic species (three in the Mediterranean {{and one in the}} Atlantic) {{widespread}} in midlittoral habitats. Throughout the range, populations with or without an <b>ocular</b> pigmented <b>shield</b> are found. We investigated the genetic structure of the North-East Atlantic populations with the aim of shedding light on their phylogeography and reconstructing possible patterns of recolonization after the Würmian glaciation. Fourteen samples were investigated using cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 13 by inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs). COI did not exhibit a clear pattern of decreased genetic diversity along a latitudinal gradient. Populations from Ferrol (Spain), Doolin (Ireland), and Helsingør (Denmark) showed a higher genetic variability, whereas a {{reduction in the number of}} haplotypes was found at the northernmost edge of the distribution and in northern Ireland and Scotland. Two genetically differentiated areas (southern Europe and south-western Ireland versus northern Atlantic) were revealed by ISSR data. The results obtained provided evidence of three refugia (Iberian Peninsula, south-western Ireland, and North Sea), and the occurrence of secondary contacts that shaped the genetic variability of some of the populations examined. Two different recolonization pathways of north-western Europe during the post-Würmian glaciations have been detected. Furthermore, ISSR analysis provided evidence of genetic divergence among populations with and without pigmented eyespot, suggesting the action of ecological differentiation...|$|R
