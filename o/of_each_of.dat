5|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{classification scheme}} {{has been suggested}} by Ogilvy and Carter to predict outcome and gauge therapy.

5|$|A flow is {{a process}} in which the points of a {{mathematical}} space continuously change their locations or properties over time. More specifically, in a one-dimensional geometric flow such as the curve-shortening flow, the points undergoing the flow belong to a curve, and what changes is the shape of the curve, its embedding into the Euclidean plane determined by the locations <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> its points.|$|E

The 1993 ceremony was attended by the Grand Masters <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the 50 grand lodges in the United States.

5|$|Analysis of Apollo 14 samples {{suggests}} that there are five major geologic constituents present in the immediate landing area: regolith breccias, fragmental breccias, igneous lithologies, granulitic lithologies, and impact-melt lithologies.

5|$|At a 2006 {{conference on}} Commonwealth honours, Christopher McCreery, {{an expert on}} Canada's honours, raised the concern that the three grades of the Order of Canada were {{insufficient}} to recognize the nation's very best; one suggestion was to add two more levels to the order, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders. The order of precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> the other orders (except the Order of Merit), contrary to international practice.|$|E

The mass <b>of</b> <b>each</b> <b>of</b> these bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the weak force. The force is in fact termed weak because its field strength over a given distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the strong nuclear force or electromagnetic force.|$|E
