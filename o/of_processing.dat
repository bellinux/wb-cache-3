These requirements have been an issue in province over the years for numerous reasons including; the cost <b>of</b> <b>processing,</b> labour availability and because some markets are interested in less processed fish. The Minister of Fisheries and Aquaculture can grant a company exemptions from minimum processing requirements.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to reporting active processors, Folding@home determines its computing performance as measured in floating point {{operations per second}} (FLOPS) based on the actual execution time of its calculations. Originally this was reported as native FLOPS: the raw performance from each given type <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> hardware. In March 2009 Folding@home began reporting the performance in native and x86 FLOPS, the latter being an estimation of how many FLOPS the calculation would take on a standard x86 CPU architecture, which is commonly used as a performance reference. Specialized hardware such as GPUs can efficiently perform some complex functions in one floating point operation which otherwise needs multiple operations on the x86 architecture. The x86 measurement attempts to even out these hardware differences. Despite conservative conversions, the GPU clients' x86 FLOPS are consistently greater than their native FLOPS and comprise {{a large majority of}} Folding@home's measured computing performance.|$|E
5|$|In this situation, {{the court}} had decided in {{previous}} cases that immigration detention, for the purposes <b>of</b> <b>processing</b> and removal, did not infringe on Chapter III. Al-Kateb argued that if indeed {{the provisions of the}} Migration Act extended as far as to allow the indefinite detention of people like him, then it would have gone beyond those valid purposes and would infringe Chapter III. That is, non-judicial detention is permitted for the purposes of facilitating the removal of unlawful non-citizens, and if the prospects of removal are remote or impracticable for the reasonably foreseeable future, then the detention can no longer be considered to be for the purpose of removal. Al-Kateb's argument in this respect relied on a decision of the Federal Court in another case, Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs v Al Masri, in which a Full Court of the Federal Court found that a person in a very similar situation to Al-Kateb was entitled to be released.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{a lot of}} efforts have been {{provided}} to explore the production of bulk ultrafined/nanostructured materials directly from microstructured ones via severe plastic deformation (SPD), especially through equal channel angular extrusion/processing (ECAE/ECAP). In this research, a comprehensive study <b>of</b> ECAE <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> bulk Al- 6061 material was conducted. The best process route for nanostructured/ultrafined <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> bulk material was identified via comparing and simulation <b>of</b> different <b>processing</b> routes. 16 passes <b>of</b> ECAE <b>processing</b> by both <b>of</b> the physical experiment and finite element (FE) simulation were carried out, which have not been reported in available literatures and filled up the research blank after 8 passes <b>of</b> ECAE <b>processing</b> <b>of</b> Al- 6061. To investigate the effect of original material status on the performance <b>of</b> ECAE <b>processing,</b> two different heat treatment specimens were prepared for investigation of the deformation behavior, microstructure evolution and property enhancement in ECAE processing. Through experiment, {{it is found that}} there is no nanostructure obtained in even up to 16 passes <b>of</b> ECAE <b>processing</b> for Al- 6061. The best grain refinement is only at ultrafined level and the finest grain size is 0. 71 μm. There is basically no grain refinement after 8 passes <b>of</b> ECAE <b>processing.</b> In addition, the relationship between the mechanical properties and the pass number <b>of</b> ECAE <b>processing</b> is orchestrated and compared with peer researches.

30|$|It is {{precisely}} because of the importance <b>of</b> image <b>processing</b> technology that many researchers have begun research on image processing technology and achieved fruitful results. However, with the deepening <b>of</b> image <b>processing</b> technology research, today’s research has a tendency to develop in depth, and this depth is an in-depth aspect <b>of</b> image <b>processing</b> technology. However, the application <b>of</b> image <b>processing</b> technology is a system engineering. In addition to the deep requirements, there are also systematic requirements. Therefore, if the unified model research on multiple aspects of image application will undoubtedly promote the application <b>of</b> image <b>processing</b> technology. Wavelet transform has been successfully applied in many fields <b>of</b> image <b>processing</b> technology. Therefore, this paper uses wavelet transform as a method to establish a unified model based on wavelet transform. Simulation research is carried out by filtering, watermark hiding, encryption and decryption, and image compression <b>of</b> image <b>processing</b> technology. The results show that the model has achieved good results.|$|R
