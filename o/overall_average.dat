40|$|Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET) {{consists}} of dynamic topology as nodes {{in the network}} are mobile, and connected via wireless links. The nodes are grouped in clusters {{for the purpose of}} routing. Nodes within the cluster communicate directly. However, nodes communicate outside the cluster through a centralized node that is called a clusterhead. An elected clusterhead is assigned for communication with all other clusters. The centralized clusterhead can become a bottleneck and possibly cause a lower throughput for the clustering system. We propose a mechanism in which communication outside the cluster is distributed through separate clusterheads.

5|$|US2 enters Michigan from Wisconsin for {{the first}} time north of {{downtown}} Hurley, Wisconsin, and Ironwood, Michigan, over the state line that runs along the Montreal River. The highway crosses the river into Gogebic County and passes a welcome center on the way into a commercial district north of downtown. Running along Cloverland Drive, US2 meets its only business route in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard. The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown Ironwood and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway. The Wisconsin Department of Transportation has removed the signage on their side of the border, which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line. US2 continues eastward through UP woodlands to the city of Bessemer. While bypassing the community of Ramsay, the highway crosses a branch of the Black River. The roadway enters Wakefield {{on the south side of}} Sunday Lake, meeting M‑28 at a stoplight in town. As the US Highway leaves Wakefield, it turns southeasterly through the Ottawa National Forest, crossing Jackson Creek and two branches of the Presque Isle River. US2 and M‑64 merge and run concurrently over the second branch of the Presque Isle in the community of Marenisco. This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state; in 2010 the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of 770vehicles, compared to the <b>overall</b> <b>average</b> of 5,188vehicles for the highway. At the end of the concurrency, M‑64 turns northerly to run along Lake Gogebic.|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 7 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Turkey, 19 - 21 July, 2010. Experimental investigations have been reported on steady state forced convection from the outer surface of horizontal triangular surface ducts in cross flow of air. The triangular cylinder was set such that its vertex faces the flow. Four equilateral triangular ducts have been used with cross section side length of 0. 03, 0. 05, 0. 08 and 0. 12 m, corresponding to blockage ratios 0. 066, 0. 110, 0. 175 and 0. 263 respectively. The ducts are heated using internal constant heat flux heating elements. The temperatures along the surface and peripheral directions of the duct wall are measured.
