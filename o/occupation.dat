During the 1880s {{agricultural}} products became the highest export earner and farming was a major <b>occupation</b> within New Zealand. Farming is still a major employer, with 75 000 people indicating farming as their <b>occupation</b> during the 2006 census, although dairy farming has recently taken over from sheep as the largest sector. The largest <b>occupation</b> recorded during the census was sales assistant with 93,840 people. Most people are on wages or salaries (59.9 percent), with the other sources of income being interest and investments (24.1 percent) and self-employment (16.6 percent).|$|E

30|$|Overall, therefore, {{two main}} {{conclusions}} can be drawn.

5000|$|Sociologists Blau and Duncan {{collected}} mobility data {{along with}} the U.S. Bureau of the Census in 1962. The data included information on occupational family backgrounds. In 1962, 56.8% of sons with fathers who had <b>occupations</b> in upper nonmanual ended up with <b>occupations</b> in the same level. Only 1.2% of sons with fathers who had farming <b>occupations</b> ended up in upper nonmanual <b>occupations.</b> In 1973, these differences increased. 59.4% of sons with fathers in upper nonmanual <b>occupations</b> achieved <b>occupations</b> of this same level and 0.9% of sons with fathers in farming <b>occupations</b> ended up in upper nonmanual <b>occupations.</b> However, the occupational structure is more rigid towards the top and bottom. Those in lower nonmanual <b>occupations,</b> and upper and lower manual <b>occupations</b> {{were more likely to}} be vertically mobile. Upper nonmanual <b>occupations</b> have the highest level of occupational inheritance.

However, by 2003 improvements in econometrics showed that poverty could endure over several generations.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the concept of}} balance in daily <b>occupations.</b> The overarching aim was to explore women’s patterns of everyday <b>occupations</b> and to investigate relationships between different aspects of patterns of daily <b>occupations</b> and health and well-being. The participants were working, cohabitant women with pre-school children. The methods used focused on exploring patterns of daily <b>occupations</b> and assessing sociodemographic aspects, self-rated health, and well-being. The results imply methodological development for documenting patterns of daily <b>occupations,</b> measuring occupation-related experiences associated with daily <b>occupations,</b> and categorising patterns of daily <b>occupations</b> according to complexity. This thesis identified {{the building blocks of}} patterns of daily <b>occupations</b> as main, hidden and unexpected <b>occupations.</b> Women’s hassling experiences associated with daily <b>occupations</b> were generated mainly by the social environment and their uplifting experiences resulted primarily from performing <b>occupations.</b> Moreover, typical patterns of daily <b>occupations</b> with respect to complexity were identified, and relationships of complexity in patterns of daily <b>occupations</b> to health and well-being were investigated. The result indicated that more hassles in combination with low control and high complexity in pattern of daily <b>occupations</b> mean an increased risk of experiencing low health and well-being. The findings contribute to the knowledge base of occupational science by further illuminating the concept of pattern of daily occupations: its constituents and its complexity. The results contribute to research on women’s total workload in relation to a sense of well-being and give implications for occupational therapy intervention for people who have taken ill due to imbalance in their pattern of daily <b>occupations...</b>|$|R
