Este trabalho corresponde ao primeiro registro dessa espécie no estado de Sergipe, em quatro localidades do alto sertão sergipano. Foram observados dois exemplares de W. pyrrhorhinus abrigando-se em ninhos construídos com capim seco emaranhado em Pilosocereus gounellei, a aproximadamente 1, 26 m do solo, no início da tarde. Esses ninhos apresentavam vestígios de aves (penas) e possuíam formato <b>ovóide,</b> com uma única abertura {{perpendicular}} ao solo. _________________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACT: The rodent Wiedomys pyrrhorhinus {{is considered}} an endemic species of the Caatinga biome, being registered in different states of northeast of Brazil. This species presents arboreal and terrestrial habits and occurs in open areas and rocky formations in its biome. This study presents the first record of this species {{in the state of}} Sergipe, in four localities. The study also shows the utilization of nests as shelter by this specie. At caatinga’s areas, characterized by trees and shrubs vegetation and a rocky landscape, Shermann and pitfall traps were used for mammalian sample. The individuals were captured at three locations in the municipality of Canindé de São Francisco. Two individuals of W. pyrrhorhinus were also observed sheltering in nests with dry grass tangled in Pilosocereus gounellei, approximately 1. 26 m above the ground, early afternoon. These nests were abandoned, however there were still signs of birds (feathers) and had an ovoid form, with one opening perpendicular to the ground...|$|E

En cultivo, tanto la estructura como la función del folículo se pierden rápidamente en las primeras 24 horas. Sin embargo, si se cultivan folículos cerrados de tiroides de rata conservan la arquitectura folicular, la morfología del tirocito y la función hasta la síntesis de hormonas tiroides de manera similar a la glándula in vivo. En este trabajo describimos el aislamiento y cultivo de folículos porcinos cerrados y su análisis morfológico. Los folículos se aíslan por digestión enzimática y disociación mecánica del parénquima tiroideo, luego se cultivan sobre agarosa con y sin hormona tirotrópica o tirotropina (1 mU/ml, TSH). El tejido de tiroides porcino obtenido tiene las mismas características de una glándula hipotiroidea in vivo, un epitelio casi plano, retículo endoplásmico rugoso (RER) exiguo, complejo de Golgi (CG), y microvellosidades escasas y cortas. Los folículos cultivados sin TSH conservan la forma <b>ovoide</b> y el coloide en su interior, y la misma ultra-estructura del tejido in vivo, RER y CG muy escasos, pero {{con el tiempo}} de cultivo aumenta la longitud de la microvellosidades y el espesor del epitelio. En presencia de TSH el epitelio se hipertrofia desde el primer día y las cavidades foliculares se reducen considerablemente. Se demuestra que folículos cerrados de tiroides durante ocho días (d) de cultivo conservan su morfología con y sin TSH. Además, estos responden al estímulo de TSH disminuyendo su cavidad folicular y aumentando el espesor del epitelio folicular. The {{morphological}} {{and functional}} unit of the thyroid gland is the follicle - an ovoid closed-structure, constituted by a layer of cubical cells (thyrocytes) that lock up a full lumen of the colloid secreted by themselves. In culture, the structures {{as well as the}} function of the follicles are lost rapidly in the first 24 hours. However, if the rat thyroid follicles closed are seeded {{since the beginning of the}} culture, these conserve the follicular structure, the thyrocyte morphology and the function even as the thyroid hormone synthesis in a similar way to the gland in vivo. This work describes the isolation and the culture of closed swine thyroid follicles and its morphological analysis. The follicles are isolated by enzymatic and mechanic digestion of the thyroid, then they are cultured in agarose with and without thyrotropin (1 mU/ml, TSH). The swine thyroid tissue obtained has the same characteristics of an in vivo hypothyroid gland, an almost flat epithelium, low quantity of Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum (RER) and Golgi complex (GC), short and very scarce microvillus. The isolated and closed follicles cultivated without TSH preserve the ovoid form and the colloid in the lumen, and the same ultrastructure of the thyroid tissue in vivo, RER and GC, but the length of the microvillus as well as the thickness of the epithelium were increased with the culture time. In the presence of TSH the thickness of the epithelium increases from the first day and the follicular cavities reduce considerably. The isolated and closed follicles preserve their morphology in the long term (8 days) of culture with and without the TSH. Besides, they responded to the stimulus of the TSH reducing the follicular cavity...|$|E

Este estudo teve como objetivos descrever as características faciais, palatinas e a erupção dentária em crianças pré-termo que receberam assistência respiratória; comparar os efeitos da ventilação mecânica invasiva (VMI) e do CPAP sobre as mesmas variáveis; observar o impacto do aleitamento, uso de chupeta e presença de displasia brocopulmonar em crianças pré-termo com idades entre 12 e 24 meses. MÉTODOS: Participaram deste estudo crianças pré-termo, procedentes do Ambulatório de Seguimento de Recém- Nascidos Pré-Termo do Hospital Universitário da Universidade de São Paulo e do Ambulatório de Seguimento dos Prematuros A 5 RN 002 do Instituto da Criança do Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, com peso ao nascimento {{inferior}} a 2000 g. Foram constituídos dois grupos a partir dos dados sociodemográficos coletados dos prontuários de internação neonatal das crianças participantes. O Grupo 1 (G 1) constituise de 34 crianças pré-termo que receberam VMI por intubação orotraqueal (IOT) por um período igual ou maior que 7 dias, e o Grupo 2 (G 2) é composto por 34 crianças pré-termo que receberam CPAP por um período de tempo igual ou maior que 72 horas. Foi realizada entrevista com a mãe ou responsável pela criança, com objetivo de obter as informações relativas à duração do aleitamento, uso da chupeta, presença/ausência de displasia broncopulmonar como sequela da prematuridade. As crianças foram submetidas a um exame de inspeção da cavidade bucal para detectar a presença de alterações no rebordo ou palato, para classificar o formato do palato (quadrado, estreito e <b>ovoide)</b> e para visualizar a erupção dos dentes decíduos, classificada em atrasada, normal ou adiantada para a idade. Foram realizadas medidas faciais, com emprego de um paquímetro, dos pontos antropométricos como: larguras facial e mandibular, terços superior, médio e inferior da face, altura facial e índice facial.

Na medicina de animais selvagens, os exames ultra-sonográficos podem ser considerados como ferramenta para diagnosticar e prevenir doenças. Deste modo, realizou-se um estudo em 20 jibóias (Boa constrictor), a fim de caracterizar a morfologia e aparência ultra-sonográfica das estruturas presentes da cavidade celomática desses animais. Ultra-sonograficamente, o fígado apresentou-se variando de hipoecóica a levemente hiperecogênica, com margens ecogênicas e ecotextura homogênea em toda sua extensão. Os rins mostraram formato elipsóide, com cápsula fina, regular e hiperecóica. Os folículos ovarianos apresentaram formato <b>ovóide,</b> margens finas, regulares e discretamente hiperecóicas. As estruturas do sistema reprodutor do macho não foram evidenciadas com precisão, devido a sua ecogenicidade similar em relação às estruturas adjacentes e pela presença do "corpo gorduroso" localizado nessa região. A ultra-sonografia da cavidade celomática em jibóias demonstrou ser uma técnica rápida e de fácil acesso, permitindo identificar a morfologia, sintopia e aparência ultra-sonográfica de estruturas como o fígado, rins e de folículos vitelogênicos nas fêmeas. Currently, {{wild animals}} have been received special attention for domestic breeding. In Wild Animal Medicine, ultrasonographic exams {{could be considered}} as a tool to diagnose and prevent disease. Ultrasonographic examination of twenty snakes (Boa constrictor) was performed in order to describe the morphological and ultrasonography appearance of their coelomic structures. Examination by ultrasonography revealed the parechymal liver ranging from slightly hypoechogenic to hyperechogenic, with echogenic margins and homogeneous echotexture in total scanning of this organ. The kidney was accessible for examination by sagittal ultrasound, showing an ellipsoid shape, a hyperechogenic capsule with a thin and regular wall. Ultrasonographic scanning of ovarian follicle showed an ovoid shape, as well as a thin, regular and slightly hyperechogenic edge. No evident structures from male reproductive system were identified by ultrasound examination because of their similar echogenic appearance to the tissues around and the "body fat" that lies in this region. Examination by ultrasound of the coelomic structures was a fast and repeatable technique, which provides useful data to recognize the morphology, sintopy and ultrasonographic appearance of organs such as liver, kidneys and vitellogenic follicles...|$|E
40|$|A {{new species}} of South American lymnaeid snail, Lymnaea rupestris, is described. So far {{it has been found}} only in its type-locality, Nova TeuTõnia, a village in the {{municipality}} of Seara (27 ° 07 ' S, 52 ° 17 ' W), state of Santa Catarina, Brazil. It is distinguishable, by characteristics of the shell and internal organs, from the other two lymnaeid species known to occur in the area, Lymnaea columella and L. viatrix. Its shell has 4 markedly shouldered whorls, deep suture, ovoid or rounded aperture occupying about half the length of the shell, and reaches about 6 mm in length in adults; in columella and viatrix the shell has 4 - 5 rounded whorls, shallow suture, and reaches over 10 mm in adults; the aperture is ovoid, occupying about half the length of the shell in viatrix, about two thirds in columella. Anatomically it is readily separated from L. columella by the shape of the ureter, straight in rupestris, with a double flexure in columella. Comparison with L. viatrix shows the following main differences: distalmost portion of the oviduct with a low, caplike lateral swelling in rupestris, with a well-developed pouch in viatrix; uterus bent abruptly caudalward in rupestris, only slightly curved rightward in viatrix; basal half of the spermathecal duct hidden by the prostate in rupestris, wholly visible or nearly so in viatrix; spermiduct sinuous and uniformly wide in rupestris, straight and gradually narrowing in viatrix; prostate more than half as long and nearly as wide as the nidamental gland, and with a slit-like lumen in cross-section in rupestris, less than half as long as and much narrower than the nidamental gland, and with an inward fold in cross-section in viatrix; penial sheath about as long and as wide as the prepuce in rupesris, shorter and narrower than the prepuce in viatrix. An important ecological characteristic of L. rupestris is its habitat on wet rocks most often outside bodies of water, although in close proximity to them. Specimens were deposited in the following malacological collections: Instituto OswaldoCruz, Rio de Janeiro; Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia; Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan; and British Museum (Natural History). É descrita uma nova espécie de limneídeo sul-americano, Lymnaea rupestris. Até agora só foi encontrada na sua localidade-tipo, Nova Teutônia, distrito do município de Seara (27 ° 07 'S, 52 ° 17 'W), Santa Catarina, Brasil. Distingue-se, pelos caracteres da concha e dos órgãos internos, das outras duas espécies conhecidas na área - Lymnaea columella e L. viatrix. A concha de L. rupestris tem 4 giros subangulosos, sutura profunda, abertura <b>ovóide</b> ou arredondada ocupando cerca de metade do comprimento da concha, e atinge cerca de 6 mm de comprimento nos adultos; em columella e viatrix a concha tem 4 - 5 giros arredondados, sutura rasa, e atinge mais de 10 mm nos adultos; a abertura é ovóide,ocupando cerca de metade do comprimento da concha em viatrix, cerca de dois terços em columella. Anatomicamente é fácil distingui-la de L. columella pela forma do ureter, reto em rupestris, com dupla flexão em columella. Comparada com L. viatrix apresenta as seguintes diferenças principais: porção mais distal do oviduto com baixa protuberância lateral em forma de barrete em rupestris, com uma bolsa bem desenvolvida em viatrix; útero dobrado abruptamente na direção caudal em rupestris, apenas ligeiramente curvado para a direita em viatrix; metade basal do canal da espermateca oculta pela próstata em rupestris, inteiramente ou quase inteiramente visível em viatrix; espermiduto sinuoso e de largura uniforme em rupestris, reto e estreitando-se gradualmente em viatrix; próstata com mais de metade do comprimento e quase da mesma largura da glândula nidamental, e com luz simples em forma de fenda em corte transversal em rupesris, com menos de metade do comprimento e muito mais estreita que a glândula nidamental, e com uma prega da parede projetando-se na luz em corte transversal em viatrix; bainha do pênis mais ou menos do mesmo comprimento e da mesma largura que o prepúcio em rupestris, mais curta e mais estreita que o prepúcio em viatrix. Importante característica ecológica de L. rupestris é seu habitat em rochedos muito úmidos, localizados mais freqüentemente fora das coleções hídricas porém contíguos a elas.

One isolate could not be identified at the species level. T. inkin was identified for the first time as a white piedra agent in the hair shaft on child under the age of 10...|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the erosion described above, several major fracture zones are present in both of the Soultz-sous-Forêts wells (GPK- 1 and GPK- 2). Two of them affect the Marnes à <b>Ovoïdes</b> (Jurassic) in GPK- 1 and GPK- 2, which lacks two-thirds of it thickness (Fig.  5). The thicknesses of the other Jurassic units are approximately the same, with a few variations being caused by weak lateral thickness variations.|$|R
5000|$|The genus {{was first}} {{described}} by the German dermatologist Gustav Behrend in 1890, based on yeasts isolated from the hairs of a moustache where they were causing the condition known as [...] "white piedra". Behrend called his new species T. <b>ovoides,</b> but subsequently Pleurococcus beigelii (later recombined as Trichosporon beigelii) {{was considered to be}} an earlier name for the same species and was accepted as the type of the genus Trichosporon.|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{isolates}} of Trichosporon cutaneum, the causative {{agent of}} trichosporonosis, were identified {{on the basis}} of DNA relatedness. Of the 10 strains from deep-seated and mucosa-associated infections, 9 were identified as T. asahii and 1 was identified as T. <b>ovoides.</b> The two superficial strains were identified as T. cutaneum and a variety of T. montevideense. These findings suggest that T. cutaneum is a heterogeneous species in clinical samples and that the causative agents of trichosporonosis exist in four or more species...|$|R
50|$|Several Trichosporon species occur {{naturally}} {{as part of}} the microbiota {{of human}} skin. Occasionally, particularly in circumstances of high humidity, the fungus can proliferate, causing an unpleasant but harmless hair condition known as white piedra. Soft, pale nodules containing yeast cells and arthroconidia form on hairs of the scalp and body. The species responsible include Trichosporon <b>ovoides,</b> T. inkin, T. asahii, T. mucoides, T. asteroides, and T. cutaneum. The obsolete name T. beigelii was formerly applied to all or any of these species.|$|R
40|$|White piedra is a {{superficial}} fungal {{infection of the}} hair shaft, caused by Trichosporon beigelii. We report two cases of white piedra presenting as brown palpable nodules along the hair shaft with a fragility of scalp hairs. T. beigelii was demonstrated in hair culture of both the patients and T. <b>ovoides</b> as a species was confirmed on carbohydrate assimilation test. The first patient responded to oral itraconazole and topical ketoconazole, with {{a decrease in the}} palpability of nodules and fragility of scalp hairs at the end of two months...|$|R
5000|$|DNA {{sequencing}} {{has also}} shown that white piedra {{can be caused by}} more than one Trichoporon species. As a result, Trichosporon beigelii has become a name of uncertain application. McPartland & Goff selected a neotype strain that makes T. beigelii synonymous with Trichosporon cutaneum. Guého and others, however, have argued that T. beigelii should be discarded (as a dubious name) and Behrend's original T. <b>ovoides</b> (for which a neotype strain has also been selected) should become the type. [...] As a result of this uncertainty, the name T. beigelii is now obsolete.|$|R
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} {{sequences of}} the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and 2 regions in the rRNA gene were determined by directly sequencing PCR-amplified fragments {{for all of the}} species (17 species and five varieties) in the genus Trichosporon. Comparative sequence analysis suggests that six medically relevant species, T. asahii, T. asteroides, T. cutaneum, T. inkin, T. mucoides, and T. <b>ovoides,</b> can be readily identified by their ITS sequences. In addition, the sequence analysis showed that conspecific strains have fewer than 1 % nucleotide differences in the ITS 1 and 2 regions overall. Molecular phylogenetic trees are also presented...|$|R
50|$|Trichosporon beigelii {{was widely}} {{assumed to be}} the causative agent of white piedra in humans and other animals until the advent of DNA sequencing, {{when it became clear}} that more than one Trichosporon species could cause the infection. McPartland & Goff {{selected}} a neotype strain that made T. beigelii synonymous with T. cutaneum. Guého and others, however, selected a neotype strain that made T. beigelii synonymous with T. <b>ovoides.</b> Since it is not clear to which of these (or other Trichosporon species) the name T. beigelii should be applied, the name is now considered to be of uncertain application and hence obsolete.|$|R
40|$|Piedra, is an {{asymptomatic}} {{fungal infection}} of the hair shaft, resulting {{in the formation of}} nodules of different hardness on the infected hair. The infection also known as Trichomycosis nodularis is a superficial fungal infection arising from the pathogen being restricted to the stratum corneum with little or no tissue reaction. The nodules are a concretion of hyphae and fruiting bodies of the fungus. Two varieties of Piedra may be seen, Black Piedra and White Piedra. The fungus Trichosporon <b>ovoides</b> is involved in the occurrence of both types of Piedras. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the effectiveness of selected essential oils for the control of growth of the fungus and to determine whether the antifungal effect was due to the major compounds of the oils. Two screening methods viz. Agar well diffusion assay and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration were adopted for the study. MIC and MFC were determined by tube dilution method. Essential oils from Eucalyptus, Ocimum basilicum, Mentha piperita, Cymbopogon flexuosus, Cymbopogon winterians, Trachyspermum ammi, Zingiber officinalis, Citrus limon, Cinnamomon zeylanicum, Salvia sclarea, Citrus aurantifolia, Melaleuca alternifolia, Citrus aurantium, Citrus bergamia, Pogostemon pathchouli, Cedrus atlantica, Jasminum officinale, Juniperus communis, Abelmoschus moschatus, Cyperus scariosus, Palargonium graveolens, Boswellia carterii, Rosa damascene, Veteveria zizanoides and Commiphora myrrha were evaluated. The essential oils of Cymbopogon winterians, Mentha piperita, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, Melaleuca alternifolia and Eucalyptus globulus were proved to be most effective against the fungus Trichosporon <b>ovoides...</b>|$|R
30|$|Finally, the {{occurrence}} of two normal faults that affect the Lias and Muschelkalk units in the GPK- 1 borehole was highlighted. The fault in the Lias led to {{the disappearance of the}} majority of the Marnes à <b>Ovoïdes</b> formation. The fault observed in the Muschelkalk is associated with the removal of the complete Marnes Bariolées and the lower part of the Dolomie à Lingules. In GPK- 2, we identified four normal faults (one present in both wells, and three others only present in one well)—that are present in the Lias, Muschelkalk and Keuper. The sum total of the thickness missing from the stratigraphic column of Soultz-sous-Forêts, compared to the one of Rittershoffen, is approximately 790  m.|$|R
30|$|The {{expression}} of extracellular enzymes has been increasingly studied in yeasts that are pathogenic to humans and other animals. Most {{of this work}} has been dedicated to the characterization of extracellular enzyme expression in the genus Candida, the most important yeast cause of nosocomial fungal infections. There are few published studies {{on the characteristics of}} enzymatic activity in Trichosporon spp. isolates (Ahearn et al. 1968; Teichert et al. 1989; Naglik et al. 2004). In the present study, exoenzymatic activity was detected in samples of T. asahii (n[*]=[*] 18) T. inkin (n[*]=[*] 10) T. mucoides (n[*]=[*] 4) and T. <b>ovoides</b> (n[*]=[*] 12). The extracellular enzymatic activity displayed by the samples of Trichosporon spp. varied according to the enzyme studied. Lipase activity was observed in 95.5 % of the isolates studied, whereas phospholipase, protease and DNase activity was detected in 56.8 %, 50 % and 38.6 % of the samples, respectively.|$|R
30|$|Currently, 50 Trichosporon {{species are}} recognized, 16 {{of which are}} {{considered}} etiological agents of infection: Trichosporon asahii, T. asteroides, T. coremiiforme, T. cutaneum, T. chiarelli, T. dermatis, T. dohaense, T. domesticum, T. faecale, T. inkin, T. japonicum, T. jirovecii, T. lactis, T. montevideense, T. mucoides and T. <b>ovoides</b> (Pagnocca et al. 2010; Colombo et al. 2011). Trichosporon species isolated from clinical samples are associated with specific types of infection. T. inkin and T. ovoid es are common agents of white piedra of the pubic hair and scalp, respectively, whereas T. asteroides and T. cutaneum are associated with lesions of the skin and nails (Chagas-Neto et al. 2008). T. asahii is the species most frequently associated with invasive infections, followed by T. mucoides and T. inkin (Fleming et al. 2002; Madariaga et al. 2003). The objective {{of this research was}} to investigate the influence of temperature on the kinetics of the expression of proteases, phospholipases, lipases and DNases by different species of Trichosporon and to establish laboratory parameters for this emerging opportunistic yeast.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} faults, we {{consider}} any significant thickness variations {{in a given}} layer to indicate the occurrence of a fault. For example, at 641  m in GPK- 1, the unit Marnes à <b>Ovoïdes</b> is only one-third as thick as expected (18.5  m instead of the 44  m) {{because of the presence}} of a fault. From mud logging based primarily on mud losses, we can define the permeability of a given structure (faults or fracture zones). Faults will also be used for the description of the seismic profile because a profile is supposed to represent only large “faults” with minimum vertical apparent offset of 10  m (Walsh 1988). Natural fracture or fault permeability is mainly based on mud losses, gas anomalies (Helium, CO 2) and high ROP values recorded during drilling operations (Vuataz et al. 1990; Vidal et al. 2015). In addition, temperature logs as well as spinner logs combined with acoustic log (BHTV) are a very powerful tool for identifying fractures bearing natural permeability in a Soultz borehole (Evans et al. 2005). Due to the lack of information on fault displacements, the term “fracture zones” is used.|$|R
30|$|Forty-four {{samples of}} Trichosporon spp. were studied. The samples were {{classified}} in the collection as EPM 001 / 2009 to EPM 040 / 2012. Four strains were standard strains (T. asahii CBS 2479, T. inkin CBS 5585, T. mucoides CBS 7625, and T. <b>ovoides</b> CBS 7556), and the other 40 isolates were clinical samples maintained by periodic sampling in the Mycology Laboratory of the Departments of Cellular Biology and Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology at the Federal University of São Paulo (UNIFESP). The isolates were previously identified by their phenotypic and genotypic profiles, as recommended by Rodriguez-Tudela et al. (2005). Cultures maintained in Sabouraud dextrose agar were used {{for all of the}} tests up to 72  h. To standardize the enzymatic activity readings, tests were performed at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 15  days of incubation. The enzymatic activity (Pz) was determined by calculating the ratio of the diameter of the colony (dc) to the diameter of the halo produced (dcd). The results were classified as follows: negative (Pz[*]=[*] 1.0), positive (0.64 [*]≤[*]Pz[*]<[*] 1.0) or strongly positive (Pz[*]<[*] 0.64), as described by Price et al., 1982.|$|R
30|$|Sequence {{analysis}} of ITS domain and/or D 1 /D 2 {{domain of the}} 26 S rRNA gene techniques were applied in identifying yeasts for various purposes. For example, Pan et al. (2009) identified 20 oleaginous yeasts by sequencing the D 1 /D 2 domains of 26 S r DNA (rRNA gene). The nucleotide sequences of ITS 1 and 2 regions in the rRNA gene were determined by directly sequencing PCR-amplified fragments for species (17 species and five varieties) in the genus Trichosporon (Sugita et al. 1999). Comparative sequence analysis suggests that six medically relevant species, T. asahii, T. asteroides, T. cutaneum, T. inkin, T. mucoides and T. <b>ovoides.</b> Some other investigators were able differentiate the different species within Saccharomyces genera (Oda et al. 1997; Fernandez-Espinar et al. 2000). Fernandez-Espinar et al. (2000) identified flour yeasts using such method. Yeasts involved in the spoilage of yoghurt were also identified using this method (Caggia et al. 2001). Leaw et al. (2006) also identified medically important yeasts using ITS 1 and ITS 2 sequencing. They {{were able to identify}} 373 strains (86 species). Mohamed et al. (2014) identified three isolates of R. mucilaginosa and three of R. glutinis using ITS.|$|R
30|$|The fault {{located at}} 641  m in GPK- 1 and 686  m in GPK- 2 affects the same unit {{in both of}} the wells: the Marnes à <b>Ovoïdes.</b> The same {{apparent}} offset is observed because in each well, two-thirds of the unit are missing (the units are 19 and 22.5  m thick in GPK- 1 and GPK- 2, respectively, as against 45  m {{in the case of}} Rittershoffen). This means that it could be the same fault affecting this Jurassic unit at Soultz-sous-Forêts. In GPK- 1 —the three deepest faults (1002, 1049 and 1219  m) could correspond to the imbrication of the Soultz-sous-Forêts fault branches, as observed on the seismic profile. In GPK- 2, the three deepest faults (793, 911 and 1064  m) could also be the Soultz-sous-Forêts fault branches. In fact, due to the complex geometry of this fault, these branches are observed at a shallower depth than at GPK- 1. Moreover, on the seismic profile, we observe a projection of the well, which also induces some geometric approximations. Therefore, we did not observe anything at the depth estimated for the Soultz-sous-Forêts fault in GPK- 2 because it was not at the exact same depth (GPK- 2 being projected). The top of the granitic basement is deeper at GPK- 2 than at GPK- 1; thus, we observe a general ‘deepening’ of this fault surface to the south.|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose: Trichosporon is a genus of {{anamorphic}} basidiomycetous yeast {{which is}} widely distributed {{in nature and}} is found in tropical and temperate areas. The aim of this work was to study the isolation, identification and molecular analysis of Trichosporon species in soil. Materials and Methods: In order to isolate and identify Trichosporon species in soil, 30 samples were collected from 30 different locations across Iran. The isolates were identified {{by means of the}} standard methods of yeast identification. To confirm morphological identification, genomic DNA was extracted and the hypervariable D 1 /D 2 domain of the large-subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using primer pair NL- 1 /NL- 4, and then the sequences were analyzed. Results: According to the morphological and physiological assessments, isolates were identified as T. coremiiforme. The isolates formed chlamydospore after one week on yeast-malt (YM) agar medium. Using Blast program, we found that the D 1 /D 2 sequences of the T. coremiiforme isolates from Iran (accession no: KP 055040 and KP 055041) showed 99 % homology with the T. coremiiforme deposited in GenBank. All the T. coremiiforme isolates placed in the <b>Ovoides</b> cluster were well-supported by bootstrap values. Conclusion: The present study is the first attempt to survey Trichosporon in soil of Iran. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first investigation of T. coremiiforme in Iran...|$|R
40|$|Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous (Late Volgian–latest Ryazanian) rhynchonellate brachiopods are {{described}} from {{eight out of}} 15 hydrocarbon seep deposits in the Slottsmøya Member of the Agardhfjellet Formation in the Janusfjellet to Knorringfjellet area, central Spitsbergen, Svalbard. The fauna comprises rhynchonellides, terebratulides (terebratuloids and loboidothyridoids) and a terebratellidine. The rhynchonellides include: Pseudomonticlarella varia Smirnova; Ptilorhynchia mclachlani sp. nov.; and Ptilorhynchia obscuricostata Dagys. The terebratulides belong to the terebratuloids: Cyrtothyris? sp.; Cyrtothyris aff. cyrta (Walker); Praelongithyris? aff. borealis Owen; and the loboidothyridoids: Rouillieria cf. michalkowii (Fahrenkohl); Rouillieria aff. <b>ovoides</b> (Sowerby); Rouillieria aff. rasile Smirnova; Uralella? cf. janimaniensis Makridin; Uralella? sp.; Pinaxiothyris campestris? Dagys; Placothyris kegeli? Harper et al.; and Seductorithyris septemtrionalis gen. et sp. nov. The terebratellidine Zittelina? sp. is also present. Age determinations for {{all but one of}} the brachiopod-bearing seeps are based on associated ammonites. Five of the seep carbonates have yielded Lingularia similis?, and it is the only brachiopod species recorded from two of the seeps. Other benthic invertebrate taxa occurring in the seeps include bivalves, gastropods, echinoderms, sponges, and serpulid and non-serpulid worm tubes. The brachiopod fauna has a strong Boreal palaeobiogeographic signature. Collectively, the Spitsbergen seep rhynchonellate brachiopods exhibit high species richness and low abundance (< 100 specimens from 8 seeps). This contrasts markedly with other Palaeozoic–Mesozoic brachiopod-dominated seep limestones where brachiopods are of low diversity (typically monospecific) with a super-abundance of individuals. The shallow water environmental setting for the Spitsbergen seeps supported a diverse shelf fauna, compared to enigmatic Palaeozoic–Mesozoic brachiopod-dominated seeps...|$|R
40|$|Trichosporon {{species have}} been {{reported}} as emerging pathogens and usually occur in severely immunocompromised patients. In the present work, 27 clinical isolates of Trichosporon species were recovered from 27 patients. The patients were not immunocompromised, except for one with acute myeloid leukemia. Sequence analysis revealed the isolation of Trichosporon dohaense Taj-Aldeen, Meis & Boekhout sp. nov., with CBS 10761 (T) as the holotype strain, belonging to the <b>Ovoides</b> clade. In the D 1 -D 2 large-subunit rRNA gene analysis, T. dohaense is a sister species to T. coremiiforme, and in the internal transcribed spacer analysis, the species is basal to the other species of this clade. Molecular identification of the strains yielded 17 T. asahii, 3 T. inkin, 2 T. japonicum, 2 T. faecale, and 3 T. dohaense isolates. The former four species exhibited low MICs for five antifungal azoles but showed high MICs for amphotericin B. T. dohaense demonstrated the lowest amphotericin B MIC (1 mg/liter). For the majority of T. asahii isolates, amphotericin B MICs were high (MIC at which 90 % of isolates were inhibited [MIC(90) ], > or = 16 mg/liter), and except for fluconazole (MIC(90), 8 mg/liter), the azole MICs were low: MIC(90) s were 0. 5 mg/liter for itraconazole, 0. 25 mg/liter for voriconazole, 0. 25 mg/liter for posaconazole, and 0. 125 mg/liter for isavuconazole.
