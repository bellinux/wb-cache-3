40|$|Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus {{responsible}} for several significant outbreaks of debilitating acute and chronic arthritis and arthralgia {{over the past}} decade. These include a recent outbreak in the Caribbean islands and the Americas that caused more than 1 million cases of viral arthralgia. Despite the major impact of CHIKV on global health, viral determinants that promote CHIKV-induced disease are incompletely understood. Most CHIKV strains contain a conserved <b>opal</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> {{at the end of}} the viral nsP 3 gene. However, CHIKV strains that encode an arginine codon in place of the <b>opal</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> have been described, and deep-sequencing analysis of a CHIKV isolate from the Caribbean identified both arginine and opal variants within this strain. Therefore, we hypothesized that the introduction of the arginine mutation in place of the opal termination codon may influence CHIKV virulence. We tested this by introducing the arginine mutation into a well-characterized infectious clone of a CHIKV strain from Sri Lanka and designated this virus Opal 524 R. This mutation did not impair viral replication kinetics in vitro or in vivo. Despite this, the Opal 524 R virus induced significantly less swelling, inflammation, and damage within the feet and ankles of infected mice. Further, we observed delayed induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as reduced CD 4 + T cell and NK cell recruitment compared to those in the parental strain. Therefore, the opal termination codon plays an important role in CHIKV pathogenesis, independently of effects on viral replication...|$|E

In analogy with pseudogenes, we define pseudo-messenger RNA to be RNA molecules that resemble protein- coding mRNA, but cannot encode full-length proteins owing to disruptions {{of the reading}} frame. Using a rigorous computational pipeline, which rules out sequencing errors, we identify 10, 679 pseudo - messenger RNAs (approximately half of which are transposonassociated) among the 102, 801 FANTOM 3 mouse cDNAs: just over 10 % of the FANTOM 3 transcriptome.

40|$|The genomic RNA of an alphavirus encodes four {{different}} nonstructural proteins, nsP 1, nsP 2, nsP 3, and nsP 4. The polyprotein P 123 is produced when translation terminates at an opal termination codon between nsP 3 and nsP 4. The polyprotein P 1234 is produced when translational readthrough occurs {{or when the}} opal termination codon {{has been replaced by}} a sense codon in the alphavirus genome. Evolutionary pressures appear to have maintained genomic sequences encoding both a stop codon (opal) and an open reading frame (arginine) as a general feature of the O'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) genome, indicating that both are required at some point. Alternate replication of ONNVs in both vertebrate and invertebrate hosts may determine predominance of a particular codon at this locus in the viral quasispecies. However, no systematic study has previously tested this hypothesis in whole animals. We report here the results of the first study to investigate in a natural mosquito host the functional significance of the <b>opal</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> in an alphavirus genome. We used a full-length cDNA clone of ONNV to construct a series of mutants in which the arginine between nsP 3 and nsP 4 was replaced with an opal, ochre, or amber stop codon. The presence of an <b>opal</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> upstream of nsP 4 nearly doubled (75. 5 %) the infectivity of ONNV over that of virus possessing a codon for the amino acid arginine at the corresponding position (39. 8 %). Although the frequency with which the opal virus disseminated from the mosquito midgut did not differ significantly from that of the arginine virus on days 8 and 10, dissemination did began earlier in mosquitoes infected with the opal virus. Although a clear fitness advantage is provided to ONNV by the presence of an opal codon between nsP 3 and nsP 4 in Anopheles gambiae, sequence analysis of ONNV RNA extracted from mosquito bodies and heads indicated codon usage at this position corresponded with that of the virus administered in the blood meal. These results suggest that while selection of ONNV variants is occurring, de novo mutation at the position between nsP 3 and nsP 4 does not readily occur in the mosquito. Taken together, these results suggest that the primary fitness advantage provided to ONNV by the presence of an opal codon between nsP 3 and nsP 4 is related to mosquito infectivity...|$|E

As part of a study of IVa 2 function, we created a set of mutations in the IVa 2 gene in the correct location in the viral genome. Unexpectedly, an <b>opal</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> at position 6 was recovered in virus twice. Isolate # 2 showed defective viral replication, but produced late proteins at almost wild-type levels. Analysis of IVa 2 mRNA showed an additional species, larger and more abundant than the equivalent wild-type species. It was a hybrid of the 5 ′ UTR of L 3 23 kDa attached to the IVa 2 second exon, so that M 75 is the 5 ′ proximal methionine. This mRNA arises from a corresponding hybrid DNA, present in the virus stock. A protein of ∼ 40 kDa, consistent with translation from the hybrid mRNA, was detected.

40|$|The {{genes for}} the capsid protein CP and the nucleic acid-binding 12 K protein (pr 12) of potato virus M (PVM) {{constitute}} the 3 ' terminal gene cluster of the PVM RNA genome. Both proteins are presumably translated {{from a single}} subgenomic RNA. We have identified two translational strategies operating in pr 12 gene expression. Internal initiation at {{the first and the}} second AUG codon of the pr 12 coding sequence results in the synthesis of the 12 K protein. In addition the protein is produced as a CP/ 12 K transframe protein by ribosomal frameshifting. For these studies parts of the CP and pr 12 coding sequences including the putative frameshift region were introduced into an internal position of the beta-glucuronidase gene. Mutational analyses in conjunction with in vitro translation experiments identified a homopolymeric string of four adenosine nucleotides which together with a 3 ' flanking UGA stop codon were required for efficient frameshifting. The signal AAAAUGA is the first frameshift signal with a shifty stop codon to be analyzed in the eukaryotic system. Substitution of the four consecutive adenosine nucleotides by UUUU increased the efficiency of frameshifting, while substitution by GGGG or CCCC dramatically reduced the synthesis of the transframe protein. Also, UAA and UAG could replace the <b>opal</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> without effect on the frameshifting event, but mutation of UGA to the sense codon UGG inhibited transframe protein formation. These findings suggest that the mechanism of ribosomal frameshifting at the PVM signal is different from the one described by the 'simultaneous slippage' model in that only the string of four adenosine nucleotides represents the slippery sequence involved in a - 1 P-site slippage...|$|E

Y 143 C protein in the directions of S-adenosylhomocysteine synthesis or hydrolysis are decreased from 65 % to 75 %. Further, the oxidation states of coenzyme NAD differ between mutant and wild-type protein, with an increased NADH accumulation in the mutant p. Y 143 C enzyme of 88 % NADH (wild-type contains 18 % NADH). Quantitative binding of NAD is not affected. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed, that mutant p. Y 143 C subunits are able to form the tetrameric complex as is the wild-type enzyme. CD analysis showed that the p.

Change of Glu 115 to lysine in wild-type protein causes a change in thermosensitivity almost identical with that found in the p.

The YFFS are more “orthogonal” than the amber suppressor tRNA, THG 73, but the frameshift suppressors incorporate UAAs less efficiently than THG 73. A library of tRNAs derived from THG 73 has produced an amber suppressor that is “orthogonal” and suppresses similarly to THG 73. An analogous opal suppressor tRNA allows incorporation of UAAs at the UGA, <b>opal</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> The use of the amber, opal, CGGG, and GGGU codons should allow for the simultaneous incorporation of four UAAs in vivo. Bioorthogonal labeling of UAAs is useful for the addition of large fluorophores. We incorporated p-AcPhe at α 70 of the nAChR and labeled with biotin and Cy 5. 5 hydrazide. Biotin and Cy 5. 5 hydrazide consistently labeled three proteins on oocytes not expressing α 70 p-AcPhe and isn’t useful for site-specific labeling of ketone containing UAAs in oocytes.

40|$|The cloned {{dihydrofolate reductase}} gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (DFR 1) is {{expressed}} in Escherichia coli. Bacterial strain JF 1754 transformed with plasmids containing DFR 1 is at least 5 X more resistant to inhibition by the folate antagonist trimethoprim. Expression of yeast DFR 1 in E. coli suggests {{it is likely that}} the gene lacks intervening sequences. The 1. 8 kbp DNA fragment encoding yeast dhfr activity probably has its own promotor, as the gene {{is expressed in}} both orientations in E. coli. Expression of the yeast dhfr gene cloned into M 13 viral vectors allowed positive selection of DFR 1 - M 13 bacterial transfectants in medium supplemented with trimethoprim. A series of nested deletions generated by nuclease Bal 31 digestion and by restriction endonuclease cleavage of plasmids containing DFR 1 physically mapped the gene to a 930 bp region between the Pst 1 and Sal 1 cut sites. This is consistent with the 21, 000 molecular weight attributed to yeast dhfr in previous reports. From preliminary DNA sequence analysis of the dhfr DNA fragment the 3 ' terminus of DFR 1 was assigned to a position 27 nucleotides from the Eco Rl cut site on the Bam Hi - Eco Rl DNA segment. Several putative yeast transcription termination consensus sequences were identified 3 ' to the <b>opal</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon.</b> DFR 1 is expressed in yeast and it confers resistance to the antifolate methotrexate when the gene is present in 2 - 10 copies per cell. Plasmid-dependent resistance to methotrexate is also observed in a rad 6 background although the effect is somewhat less than that conferred to wild-type or rad 18 cells. Integration of DFR 1 into the yeast genome showed an intermediate sensitivity to folate antagonists. This may suggest a gene dosage effect. No change in petite induction in these yeast strains was observed in transformed cells containing yeast dhfr plasmids. The sensitivity of rad 6, rad 18 and wild-type cell populations to trimethoprim were unaffected by the presence of DFR 1 in transformants. Moreover, trimethoprim did not induce petites in any strain tested, which normally results if dhfr is inhibited by other antifolates such as methotrexate. This may suggest that the dhfr enzyme is not the only possible target of trimethoprim in yeast. rad 6 mutants showed a very low level of spontaneous petite formation. Methotrexate failed to induce respiratory deficient mutants in this strain which suggested that rad 6 might be an obligate grande. However, ethidium bromide induced petites to a level approximately 50 % of that exhibited by wild-type and rad 18 strains...|$|E
40|$|Infectious {{pancreatic}} necrosis virus (IPNV) encodes a 12 or 15 -kDa nonstructural protein, {{known as}} VP 5. To study {{the function of}} VP 5, we generated three recombinant viruses rNVI 15, rNVI 15 - 15 K, and rNVI 15 -&# 916;VP 5, which could encode either 12 -kDa VP 5, 15 -kDa VP 5 or be deficient in VP 5, respectively. VP 5 was detected in rNVI 15 and rNVI- 15 K infected cells {{but not in the}} cells infected with rNVI 15 -&# 916;VP 5. However, the <b>opal</b> <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> at nucleotide position 427 in rNVI 15 virus was read-through, giving rise to a 15 -kDa VP 5 that is expressed poorly than rNVI 15 - 15 K virus-infected cells. All three recombinant viruses show similar replication kinetics in both Chinook salmon embryo (CHSE- 214) and rainbow trout gonad (RTG- 2) cells. Moreover, in Sp strains, IPNV segment A could encode a novel, putative 25 -kDa protein from another ORF. This 25 -kDa protein could not be detected in virus-infected cells, however, we could recover a mutant virus lacking this ORF, indicating that it is not essential for virus replication. To assess the molecular basis of virus adaptation in the cell culture, virulent rNVI 15 was serially passaged in CHSE cells nine times to obtain a tissue-culture adapted virus, rNVI 15 TC. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences showed only one amino acid substitution at position 221 (Ala &# 8594; Thr) in VP 2. However, this adaptation mutation is only acquired in CHSE cells but not in RTG- 2 cells. Two chimeric viruses, rNVI 15 &# 916;VP 2 and rNVI 15 - 15 K&# 916;VP 2 were also generated, in which the residues at positions 217 and 247 in VP 2 of the rNVI 15 and rNVI 15 - 15 K viruses were replaced by the corresponding residues of an attenuated strain, Sp 103. These two viruses have similar replication kinetics as Sp 103, which replicates faster than rNVI 15 in vitro, indicating that residues at positions 217 and 247 of VP 2 may be the important markers for virus adaptation and attenuation in vitro. By generating a reassortant virus between rNVI 15 - 15 K and Sp 103, we also demonstrate that VP 1 is not involved in virus cell adaptation. The signal pathways and nature of IPNV-induced apoptosis were investigated in RTG- 2 cells. IPNV-induced apoptosis occurs at the late stage of viral life cycle. Caspase- 3 is activated during virus infection, and inhibition of caspase- 3 could partially inhibit virus-induced apoptosis. Moreover, NF-&# 954;B activation is essential for IPNV-induced apoptosis, and it is involved in interferon-induced antiviral state. Both the NF-&# 954;B inhibitor and the antioxidant could inhibit NF-&# 954;B activity and apoptosis induced by IPNV infection, but they do not affect viral replication...|$|E
40|$|Nonstop' {{mutations}} {{are single}} base-pair substitutions that occur within translational termination (<b>stop)</b> <b>codons</b> and {{which can lead}} to the continued and inappropriate translation of the mRNA into the 3 '-untranslated region. We have performed a meta-analysis of the 119 nonstop mutations (in 87 different genes) known to cause human inherited disease, examining the sequence context of the mutated <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> and the average distance to the next alternative in-frame <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> downstream, in comparison with their counterparts from control (non-mutated) gene sequences. A paucity of alternative in-frame <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> was noted in the immediate vicinity (0 - 49 nucleotides downstream) of the mutated <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> as compared with their control counterparts (p = 7. 81 × 10 - 4). This implies that at least some nonstop mutations with alternative <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> in close proximity will not have come to clinical attention, possibly because they will have given rise to stable mRNAs (not subject to nonstop mRNA decay) that are translatable into proteins of near-normal length and biological function. A significant excess of downstream in-frame <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> was, however, noted in the range 150 - 199 nucleotides from the mutated <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> (p = 8. 55 × 10 - 4). We speculate that recruitment of an alternative <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> at greater distance from the mutated <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> may trigger nonstop mRNA decay, thereby decreasing the amount of protein product and yielding a readily discernible clinical phenotype. Confirmation or otherwise of this postulate must await the emergence of a clearer understanding of the mechanism of nonstop mRNA decay in mammalian cells...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Efficient gene {{expression}} involves a trade-off between (i) premature termination of protein synthesis; and (ii) readthrough, where the ribosome fails to dissociate at the terminal <b>stop.</b> Sense <b>codons</b> {{that are similar}} in sequence to <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> {{are more susceptible to}} nonsense mutation, and are also likely to be more susceptible to transcriptional or translational errors causing premature termination. We therefore expect this trade-off to be influenced by the number of <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> in the genetic code. Although genetic codes are highly constrained, <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> number appears to be their most volatile feature. Results In the human genome, codons readily mutable to stops are underrepresented in coding sequences. We construct a simple mathematical model based on the relative likelihoods of premature termination and readthrough. When readthrough occurs, the resultant protein has a tail of amino acid residues incorrectly added to the C-terminus. Our results depend strongly on the number of <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> in the genetic code. When the code has more <b>stop</b> <b>codons,</b> premature termination is relatively more likely, particularly for longer genes. When the code has fewer <b>stop</b> <b>codons,</b> the length of the tail added by readthrough will, on average, be longer, and thus more deleterious. Comparative analysis of taxa with a range of <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> numbers suggests that genomes whose code includes more <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> have shorter coding sequences. Conclusions We suggest that the differing trade-offs presented by alternative genetic codes may result in differences in genome structure. More speculatively, multiple <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> may mitigate readthrough, counteracting the disadvantage of a higher rate of nonsense mutation. This could help explain the puzzling overrepresentation of <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> in the canonical genetic code and most variants. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{reassignment}} of <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> {{is common}} among many ciliate species. For example, Tetrahymena species recognize only UGA as a <b>stop</b> <b>codon,</b> while Euplotes species recognize only UAA and UAG as <b>stop</b> <b>codons.</b> Recent {{studies have shown}} that domain 1 of the translation termination factor eRF 1 mediates <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> recognition. While it is commonly assumed that changes in domain 1 of ciliate eRF 1 s are responsible for altered <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> recognition, this has never been demonstrated in vivo. To carry out such an analysis, we made hybrid proteins that contained eRF 1 domain 1 from either Tetrahymena thermophila or Euplotes octocarinatus fused to eRF 1 domains 2 and 3 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that the Tetrahymena hybrid eRF 1 efficiently terminated at all three <b>stop</b> <b>codons</b> when expressed in yeast cells, indicating that domain 1 is not the sole determinant of <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> recognition in Tetrahymena species. In contrast, the Euplotes hybrid facilitated efficient translation termination at UAA and UAG codons but not at the UGA codon. Together, these results indicate that while domain 1 facilitates <b>stop</b> <b>codon</b> recognition, other factors can influence this process.
