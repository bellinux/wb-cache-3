5|$|As Article 39A of the Constitution states, the GRC scheme entrenches the {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> MPs in Parliament, ensuring that interests <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> communities {{are represented in}} Parliament. Article 39A(1)(a) of the Constitution allows for a maximum number of six MPs for each GRC so as to provide flexibility in ensuring that a GRC with a rapidly expanding population is properly managed. As the population of a constituency grows, it becomes increasingly difficult for an MP to singlehandedly represent all his or her constituents' views. A team of MPs arguably has greater access to more constituents, {{and the fact that}} there are different MPs in the team suggests they can more effectively provide representation in Parliament of a wide range of constituents' views.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, {{it can be said}} that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> candidates as they would not be sure if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and the merits of the rest of the team of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E
5|$|Feminism was {{challenged}} by various minority groups for not entirely addressing the needs <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> populations. It was suggested that 'mainstream' feminism was upper caste and Hindu in its orientation {{and did not}} address the concerns <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> women. This {{led to the formation of}} the Awaaz-e-Niswaan (The Voice of Women) in 1987 in Mumbai in largely Muslim part of the city. The Muslim community has personal laws that often were considered harmful to the rights of Muslim women. The Muslim personal law allows Polygamy but not Polyandry.|$|E

Balkans is an illustrating case {{in terms of}} how important and can often be vital for a functional political system, the representation <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> within the political system and society.

There will be an analysis of the question when the protection <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> is raised for the first time to higher international instances. There will be discussions on the solutions to the problems <b>of</b> <b>minorities</b> in the bilateral field.

5|$|Based upon another {{recommendation}} from Cabranes, Sotomayor {{was a member}} of the board of directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund from 1980 to 1992. There she was a top policy maker who worked actively with the organization's lawyers on issues such as New York City hiring practices, police brutality, the death penalty, and voting rights. The group achieved its most visible triumph when it successfully blocked a city primary election on the grounds that New York City Council boundaries diminished the power <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> voters.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across different groups as distinguished from a numerical majority.

5|$|In February 1922, the Albanian Parliament {{approved}} the Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Minority</b> Rights. However, the Declaration, {{contrary to the}} Protocol of Corfu, recognized minority rights only in a limited area (parts of Gjirokastër, Sarandë district and 3 villages in Himarë), without implementing any form of local autonomy. All Greek schools in the excluded area were forced to close until 1935, in violation of obligations accepted by the Albanian government at the League of Nations. In 1925, Albania's present borders were set, leading Greece to abandon its claims to Northern Epirus.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{there was}} a flurry of {{contradictory}} statements from convention members (including Mason) about who composed which articles.

5|$|Second, Asch {{emphasized}} that independent thought and disagreement among group members is {{a cornerstone of}} group functioning.

5|$|The {{indigenous}} {{religion of}} the Māori population was animistic, but {{with the arrival of}} missionaries from the early nineteenth century most of the Māori population converted to Christianity. In the 2013 census, 2,595 Māori still identify themselves as adhering to traditional Māori beliefs. The largest Christian denominations are Roman Catholicism, Anglicanism, Presbyterianism. There are also significant numbers of Christians who identify themselves with Methodist, Pentecostal, Baptist and Latter-day Saint churches, and the New Zealand-based Rātana church has adherents among Māori. Immigration and associated demographic change in recent decades has contributed to the growth <b>of</b> <b>minority</b> religions, especially Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam.|$|E
