25|$|The cause <b>of</b> <b>DID</b> {{is unknown}} and widely debated, with debate {{occurring}} between supporters of different hypotheses: that DID is {{a reaction to}} trauma; that DID is produced by inappropriate psychotherapeutic techniques that cause a patient to enact {{the role of a}} patient with DID; and newer hypotheses involving memory processing that allows for the possibility that trauma-causing dissociation can occur after childhood in DID, as it does in PTSD. It has been suggested that all the trauma-based and stress-related disorders be placed in one category that would include both DID and PTSD. Disturbed and altered sleep has also been suggested as having a role in dissociative disorders in general and specifically in DID, alterations in environments also largely affecting the DID patient.|$|E
25|$|Although {{progesterone}} {{does not}} bind {{directly to the}} AR, it is a precursor and intermediate in the biosynthesis of androgens from cholesterol. For this reason, {{there has been some}} speculation that exogenous progesterone could be transformed into androgens by certain tissues that express the requisite enzymes. Progesterone is converted by 17α-hydroxylase into 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is converted by 17,20-lyase into androstenedione, and androstenedione is converted by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases into testosterone. CYP17A1, the cytochrome P450 gene that encodes 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, is expressed mainly in the gonads (ovaries and testes) and the adrenal glands. Despite the reasoning that progesterone could be converted into androgens however, clinical studies in which women were treated with 100 to 300mg/day OMP have found no or only a small increase in levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and no change in androgen levels, including those of dehydroepiandrosterone, androstenedione, and testosterone. In these studies, levels of estradiol and cortisol, which progesterone is also a precursor <b>of,</b> <b>did</b> not change either, although levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone did increase significantly. In accordance with the lack of changes in androgen levels, progesterone, unlike various progestins, has not been associated with androgenic effects in clinical studies, including changes in the blood lipid profile or sex hormone-binding globulin levels, acne, skin oiliness, hirsutism, or voice deepening, or induction of teratogenicity (i.e., virilization of female fetuses).|$|E

500|$|One of {{the first}} songs that was {{recorded}} for the album was [...] "Fantasy". While Carey began developing new ideas for Daydream, {{she thought of the}} song [...] "Genius of Love" [...] by Tom Tom Club. She had always been a fan of the song, and presented Dave Hall with the idea of sampling the song's hook. Hall incorporated a groove that he felt complimented Carey's voice, while she composed some of the other beats and wrote the lyrics. Carey recorded a remix to the song as well, featuring hip-hop verses from O.D.B of the Wu-Tang Clan, as well as production from Puffy. She spoke highly of the remix, complimenting Puffy and O.D.B, [...] "He's so known in the street, and he's one of the best people out there...we kind <b>of</b> <b>did</b> what we both do and having O.D.B took it to another level.

After Carey's friend and past collaborator David Cole died, she began writing and developing a song that would pay homage to him and all the friends and family her fans had lost along life's journey. Carey had the chorus and concept composed, and after meeting with Boyz II Men, they realized they too had a similar idea in development. Together, using Carey's chorus and idea, as well as the melody they had produced, they wrote and composed the song. It was produced by Afanasieff, who built on the song's melody and added various grooves and beats.|$|E

2500|$|Research {{is needed}} to {{determine}} the prevalence of the disorder in those who have never been in therapy, and the prevalence rates across cultures.

2500|$|The {{psychiatric}} history frequently contains multiple previous {{diagnoses of}} various disorders and treatment failures. The most common presenting complaint <b>of</b> <b>DID</b> is depression, with headaches being a common neurological symptom. Comorbid disorders can include substance abuse, eating disorders, anxiety, {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD), and personality disorders. [...] A significant percentage of those diagnosed with DID have histories of borderline personality disorder and bipolar disorder. Further, data supports {{a high level of}} psychotic symptoms in individuals with DID, and that both individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia and those diagnosed with DID have histories of trauma. Other disorders that {{have been found to be}} comorbid with DID are somatization disorders, major depressive disorder, as well as history of a past suicide attempt, in comparison to those without a DID diagnosis. Individuals diagnosed with DID [...] demonstrate the highest hypnotizability of any clinical population. The large number of symptoms presented by individuals diagnosed with DID has led some clinicians to suggest that, rather than being a separate disorder, diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>DID</b> is actually an indication of the severity of the other disorders diagnosed in the patient.|$|E
2500|$|The DSM-IV-TR {{states that}} acts of self-mutilation, impulsivity, and rapid changes in {{interpersonal}} relationships [...] "may warrant a concurrent diagnosis of borderline personality disorder". [...] Steven Lynn and colleagues {{have suggested that}} the significant overlap between BPD and DID may be a contributing factor to the development of therapy induced DID, in that the suggestion of hidden alters by therapists who propose a diagnosis <b>of</b> <b>DID</b> provides an explanation to patients for the behavioral instability, self-mutilation, unpredictable mood changes and actions they experience. In 1993 a group of researchers reviewed both DID and borderline personality disorder (BPD), concluding that DID was an epiphenomenon of BPD, with no tests or clinical description capable of distinguishing between the two. Their conclusions about the empirical proof <b>of</b> <b>DID</b> were echoed by a second group, who still believed the diagnosis existed, but while the knowledge to date did not justify DID as a separate diagnosis, it also did not disprove its existence. Reviews of medical records and psychological tests indicated that the majority <b>of</b> <b>DID</b> patients could be diagnosed with BPD instead, though about a third could not, suggesting that DID does exist but may be over-diagnosed. Between 50 and 66% of patients also meet the criteria for BPD, and nearly 75% of patients with BPD also meet the criteria for DID, with considerable overlap between the two conditions in terms of personality traits, cognitive and day-to-day functioning, and ratings by clinicians. [...] Both groups also report higher rates of physical and sexual abuse than the general population, and patients with BPD also score highly on measures of dissociation. [...] Even using strict diagnostic criteria, {{it can be difficult to}} distinguish between dissociative disorders and BPD (as well as bipolar disorder and schizophrenia), though the presence of comorbid anxiety disorders may help.|$|E

2500|$|Many women {{claiming}} to be SRA survivors have been diagnosed as sufferers <b>of</b> <b>DID,</b> and it is unclear if their claims of childhood abuse are accurate or a manifestation of their diagnosis. Of a sample of 29 patients who presented with SRA, 22 were diagnosed with dissociative disorders including DID. The authors noted that 58% of the SRA claims appeared {{in the years following}} the Geraldo Rivera special on SRA and a further 34% following a workshop on SRA presented in the area; in only two patients were the memories elicited without the use of [...] "questionable therapeutic practices for memory retrieval." [...] Claims of SRA by DID patients have been called [...] "...often nothing more than fantastic pseudomemories implanted or reinforced in psychotherapy" [...] and SRA a cultural script of the perception <b>of</b> <b>DID.</b> Some believe that memories of SRA are solely iatrogenically implanted memories from suggestive therapeutic techniques, though this has been criticized by Daniel Brown, Alan Scheflin and Corydon Hammond for what they argue as over-reaching the scientific data that supports an iatrogenic theory. Others have criticized Hammond specifically for using therapeutic techniques to gather information from clients that rely solely on information fed by the therapist in a manner that highly suggests iatrogenesis. Skeptics claimed that the increase in DID diagnosis on the 1980s and 1990s and its association with memories of SRA is evidence of malpractice by treating professionals.|$|E

[...] The unusual number of diagnoses after 1980, clustered around a small number of clinicians, and the suggestibility characteristic of those with DID, support the hypothesis that DID is therapist-induced.
