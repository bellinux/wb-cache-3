5|$|The primary {{symptom of}} prepatellar {{bursitis}} is the {{swelling of the}} area around the kneecap. It generally does not produce a significant amount of pain unless pressure is applied directly to the swelling. The area of swelling may be red (erythema), warm to the touch, or surrounded by cellulitis, particularly if the area has become infected. In such cases, the bursitis is often accompanied by fever. Unlike arthritis, prepatellar bursitis generally does not affect the range of motion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> though it may cause some discomfort when the knee is completely flexed. Flexion and extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> may cause crepitus.|$|E
5|$|Angular motions (or rotary motions) {{occur when}} an object is around another object {{increasing}} or decreasing the angle. The {{different parts of}} the object do not move the same distance. Examples include a movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> where the lower leg changes angle compared to the femur, or movements of the ankle.|$|E

30|$|Synovectomy was {{performed}} in 88.89  % (8 / 9) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b> At <b>the</b> latest follow-up, 12.5  % (1 / 8) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> in which synovectomy {{was performed}} were pain and swelling free. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> operated <b>knees,</b> 12.5  % (1 / 8) had recurrent effusions despite synovectomy. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients with bilateral LA rejected synovectomy in <b>the</b> right <b>knee,</b> so it remained symptomatic. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> that underwent synovectomy, 62.5  % (5 / 8) developed OA. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> patients with bilateral LA, whose initial MRIs showed no evidence of condropathy in either knee, eventually developed OA in <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> that was not surgically treated. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> operated <b>knees,</b> 37.5  % (3 / 8) underwent synovectomy {{in the first year}} after <b>the</b> onset <b>of</b> symptoms and 62.5  % (5 / 8) after the first year. All (3 / 3) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> that had undergone synovectomy when symptoms did not last more than 1  year showed no evidence of OA. All (5 / 5) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> in which synovectomy was delayed more than 1  year after clinical debut developed progressive joint degeneration.|$|R
30|$|Arthrogryposis {{is defined}} as motion {{limitation}} of three or more joints in different parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, so joints other than <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> are involved in arthrogryposis [1]. However, some children are born with involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees</b> only. As <b>the</b> treatment follows the same principles, the following text will include both arthrogryposis and isolated involvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knees.</b>|$|R

5|$|Physical {{examination}} often {{begins with}} {{examination of the}} patient's gait.

5|$|Prepatellar {{bursitis}} is an {{inflammation of}} the prepatellar bursa at the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> It is marked by swelling at the knee, which can be tender to the touch but which does not restrict the knee's range of motion. It is most commonly caused by trauma to the knee, either by a single acute instance or by chronic trauma over time. As such, prepatellar bursitis commonly occurs among individuals whose professions require frequent kneeling.|$|E
5|$|A {{definitive}} {{diagnosis of}} the condition can usually be made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b> A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, Lone Hvass of the Elsinore Museum, Miranda Aldhouse-Green of Cardiff University, and the Department of Forensic Science at the University of Århus {{performed}} a re-examination of the Haraldskær Woman. Forensic analysis revealed stomach contents of unhusked millet and blackberries. Her neck had a faint groove {{as if someone}} applied a rope for torture or strangulation. The scientists concluded bog acids caused the swelling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint and that the woman was probably already dead before the branches pinned her down. Because of her careful placement, and since cremation was the prevailing mode of interment during that period in Jutland, the examiners guess the Haraldskær Woman {{was a victim of}} ritual sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|In human anatomy, a bursa {{is a small}} pouch {{filled with}} {{synovial}} fluid. Its purpose is to reduce friction between adjacent structures. The prepatellar bursa {{is one of several}} bursae <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> joint, and is located between the patella and the skin. Prepatellar bursitis is an inflammation of this bursa. Bursae are readily inflamed when irritated, as their walls are very thin. Along with the pes anserine bursa, the prepatellar bursa {{is one of the most}} common bursae to cause knee pain when inflamed.|$|E
5|$|Once {{candidates}} for treatment have been screened, treatment proceeds {{according to the}} lesion's location. For example, those with OCD <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> are immobilized for {{four to six weeks}} or even up to six months in extension to remove shear stress from the involved area; however, they are permitted to walk with weight bearing as tolerated. X-rays are usually taken three months after the start of non-operative therapy; if they reveal that the lesion has healed, a gradual return to activities is instituted. Those demonstrating healing by increased radiodensity in the subchondral region, or those whose lesions are unchanged, are candidates to repeat the above described three-month protocol until healing is noted.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} types of {{inflammation}} that can cause knee pain, including sprains, bursitis, and injuries to the meniscus. A diagnosis of prepatellar bursitis can be made based on a physical examination {{and the presence of}} risk factors in the person's medical history; swelling and tenderness at the front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee,</b> combined with a profession that requires frequent kneeling, suggest prepatellar bursitis. Swelling of multiple joints along with restricted range of motion may indicate arthritis instead.|$|E
5|$|A {{pitch that}} is not hit into the field of play is called either a strike or a ball. A batter against whom three strikes are {{recorded}} strikes out. A batter against whom four balls are recorded is awarded a base on balls or walk, a free advance to first base. (A batter may also freely advance to first base if the batter's body or uniform is struck by a pitch outside the strike zone, provided the batter does not swing and attempts to avoid being hit.) Crucial to determining balls and strikes is the umpire's judgment as to whether a pitch has passed through the strike zone, a conceptual area above home plate extending from the midpoint between the batter's shoulders and belt down to the hollow <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee.</b>|$|E
5|$|Takanohana finally {{returned}} to the ring in September 2002, after the Sumo Association declared he must compete or retire. He finished behind Musashimaru on 12–3, the 16th time {{he had been a}} tournament runner-up. Considering how long he had been away, it was seen as an impressive comeback. However, he sat out the next tournament with a recurrence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>knee</b> injury. He made another comeback in January 2003, making a late decision to compete. A shoulder injury caused him to miss two days, and after suffering successive losses to Dejima and Aminishiki he announced his retirement. He said he had no regrets and was thankful to have achieved so much in sumo. His father spoke of his relief at the decision, after seeing his son battle through so many injuries. Takanohana's record of 22 tournament championships was the fourth best in sumo history, behind only Taihō, Chiyonofuji and Kitanoumi at the time. Junichiro Koizumi, the Prime Minister, was among those paying tribute. His retirement left no Japanese born wrestlers at the yokozuna rank and was widely regarded as being the end of an era.|$|E
