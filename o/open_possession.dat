40|$|As the {{possession}} of the claimant {{in a case of}} adverse possession must be shown to have been adverse in order to ripen into title, so also must the user in prescription be shown to have been adverse during the entire prescriptive period. As to the burden of proving the adverse character of {{the possession}} in the first case there seems to be doubt whether there is a presumption of adverseness by showing <b>open</b> <b>possession</b> and acts of ownership, or whether there is a burden upon the claimant to go further. See 2 AM. 2 ̆ 6 ENG. ENCY. L. 2 ̆ 6 P. 392, and cases there cited. The usual doctrine would seem to be that it is sufficient for the claimant to prove the fact of possession together with acts of ownership, as for instance, the taking of the profits of the land. Of course in order to acquire title he must show that his possession had the further characteristics of openness, continuity, exclusiveness, etc. But generally speaking, facts of the nature above indicated are sufficient to show the hostile or adverse character of his possession. As to the situation when the possession has been due to a mistaken belief as to ownership see 11 MICH. L. R 1. 57...|$|E

This area, the Cumberland Narrows mountain pass {{led into the}} Monongahela River valley. During the 1740s, colonials were petitioning the crown to obtain lands of the so-called Ohio Country across the Allegheny Mountains from the Indians. The Cumberland narrows {{is one of only}} five navigable routes over the Appalachian Mountains barrier range. Cresap founded what is now Oldtown, Maryland by building a trading post {{at the foot of the}} Amerindian trail over Wills Mountain (renamed Haystack now near Cresaptown). The colonials wanted the crown to <b>open</b> these <b>possessions</b> for settlement, and give them out under charter in the same old way, through the crown's minister. Cresap also sent traders over the pass and explored personally in Amerindian lands along the Monongahela upriver of Redstone Old Forts. Although Maryland's land grant ended at the crest of the Appalachian mountains, both Pennsylvania and Virginia claimed their land grants continued westward, so the land claimed by Cresap and his traders west of the Appalachians ultimately became part of upper West Virginia and western Pennsylvania.|$|R
50|$|Defence Housing {{authority}} {{is one of}} the most well planned societies in the whole of Pakistan. Currently, DHA has seven phases, from phase 1 to phase 7 that are <b>open</b> for <b>possession</b> by the civilian population. The remaining four phases, from phase 8 to 11 are either in the process of development or have not seen the start of development even. Each phase has a number of sectors or blocks having English alphabets as their names which are further subdivided into plots for the construction of houses ranging from land area five marla (approx. 1361 square feet) to 2 canal (approx. 10890 square feet). Each phase also has a central commercial area for shops and offices catering to the community. The phases with the most construction and population are the Phases 1 to 5, with Phase 6 and 7 being the least developed. The overall plan of Phases 1 to 4 displays an older style of town development with narrower roads, streets and grassy areas, also without underground wiring for electrification, while also lacking sector mosques. Phase 5,6 and 7 being the most recent in terms of planning and development show sixty feet roads as well as broader streets, with underground electrification and each sector or block having its own mosque.|$|R

5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{record of}} mental illness in ancient China dates back to 1100 B.C. Mental disorders were treated mainly under Traditional Chinese Medicine by herbs, acupuncture or [...] "emotional therapy". The Inner Canon of the Yellow Emperor described symptoms, mechanisms and therapies for mental illness, emphasizing connections between bodily organs and emotions. The ancient Chinese believed that demonic possession {{played a role in}} mental illness during this time period. They felt that areas of high emotion such as funeral homes could open up the Wei Chi and allow entities to possess an individual. Trauma was also considered to be something that caused high levels of emotion. Thus, trauma is a possible catalyst for mental illness, due to its ability to allow the Wei Chi to <b>open</b> to <b>possession.</b> This explains why the ancient Chinese believed that a mental illness was in reality a demonic possession. According to Chinese thought, five stages or elements comprised the conditions of imbalance between Yin and yang. This belief about imbalance is brought about because of the Tao. The Tao is the law of nature according to Chinese beliefs, and when the Tao comes, the yin and the yang experience equilibrium. Mental illness is thus considered an imbalance of yin and yang because optimum health arises from balance with nature.|$|R

5000|$|The {{adverse party}} {{is called the}} {{disseisor}}, meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property. The disseisor must openly occupy the property exclusively, keep out others, {{and use it as}} if it were his own. Some jurisdictions permit accidental adverse possession as might occur with a surveying error. Generally, the openly hostile possession must be continual (although not necessarily continuous or constant) without challenge or permission from the lawful owner, for a fixed statutory period to acquire title. Where the property is of a type ordinarily occupied only during certain times (such as a summer cottage), the disseisor may need to have only exclusive, <b>open,</b> and hostile <b>possession</b> during those successive useful periods, making the same use of the property as an owner would for the required number of years. Adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect the title of the disseisor. These are: ...|$|R

60|$|Let me refresh the reader's memory a little. Nearly {{a hundred}} years ago the crew of the British ship Bounty mutinied, set the captain and his {{officers}} adrift upon the <b>open</b> sea, took <b>possession</b> of the ship, and sailed southward. They procured wives for themselves among the natives of Tahiti, then proceeded to a lonely little rock in mid-Pacific, called Pitcairn's Island, wrecked the vessel, stripped her of everything that might be useful to a new colony, and established themselves on shore. Pitcairn's is so far removed from the track of commerce that it was many years before another vessel touched there. It had always been considered an uninhabited island; so when a ship did at last drop its anchor there, in 1808, the captain was greatly surprised to find the place peopled. Although the mutineers had fought among themselves, and gradually killed each other off until only two or three of the original stock remained, these tragedies had not occurred before a number of children had been born; so in 1808 the island had a population of twenty-seven persons. John Adams, the chief mutineer, still survived, and was to live many years yet, as governor and patriarch of the flock. From being mutineer and homicide, he had turned Christian and teacher, and his nation of twenty-seven persons was now the purest and devoutest in Christendom. Adams had long ago hoisted the British flag and constituted his island an appanage of the British crown.|$|R
40|$|This thesis argues {{the need}} for a {{fundamental}} shift from the design of products to the design of possessions in the circular economy. Possessions in the circular economy are characterised by interactions resulting in a user-object relationship rather than legalese and differ from the linear economy in terms of their length of use and number of users. Individual users are thus seen as critical actors to enable material circulation in that they take possession and dispossess of products. Two key topics—psychological ownership and contaminated interaction—are explored in detail to fill theoretical gaps in design research and practice. After discussing these topics, some directions and guidelines are suggested. Possession or ownership is taken as an innate human desire. A framework describes the method of developing ownership including the motives, routes, and paths that guide the development of that relationship. This framework is used to describe object attachment to inform product longevity and decisions around keeping and discarding. It is also useful to help explain why some access-based models are adopted while others are not. Maintaining perceived value in the circular economy entails mitigating contaminated interaction—tainted interaction due to prior use and prior users. Contaminated interaction is shown to affect new circular business opportunities, disposal decisions and downcycling. A typology is presented to characterise indicators of use with an emphasis on sensorial material properties. Aversion to used products is found to come from three drivers: hygiene, utility and territory. A theoretical framework for contaminated interaction is presented which is explored through positive and negative forms of contamination. Finally, a case study shows how alterations in product characteristics lead to improper disposal and act as an example {{of what it means to}} design of circular <b>possessions.</b> <b>Open</b> Acces...|$|R
