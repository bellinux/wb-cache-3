25|$|On 19 August, Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette {{left his}} command at the Army of the North and entered Coalition {{territory}} with 22 {{members of his}} staff. On 17 August, the increasingly radicalized French Legislative Assembly had demanded that La Fayette report to Paris for questioning and on the 19th {{he was charged with}} treason. Not understanding that his domestic enemies wanted to guillotine him, the Prussians and Austrians imprisoned La Fayette until 1797. His replacement in army command was the more astute Charles François Dumouriez. Dumouriez dreamed of an immediate invasion of the Austrian Netherlands, but events soon forced him to hold <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> plan. On 24 August, the politically-connected François Joseph Westermann arrived at headquarters with the news that Longwy had fallen to the Coalition the day before after a feeble defense. After calling Anne François Augustin de La Bourdonnaye from the command of Lille to lead the northern wing of the Army of the North, Dumouriez headed south with Westermann and his aide-de-camp Jacques MacDonald.|$|E

2500|$|WFM member Harry Orchard later {{confessed to}} setting the {{dynamite}} bomb on the 600-foot level {{next to the}} mine shaft, and rigging it to explode when the next person got <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> level. He wrote that he and another WFM member, Billy Aiken, had entered the mine through an old unused shaft, and that a third, Billy Gaffney, had stayed at the surface as a lookout. Orchard wrote {{that he had been}} paid to plant the dynamite by Mr. Davis, the president of the Altman local, one of the WFM locals in the Cripple Creek district. When they heard nothing about an explosion during the next few days, they assumed that their bomb had failed to explode. But they had mistakenly set the bomb on an inactive level, and it did not go off until some time later, when the superintendent and the shift boss got off to inspect the 600-foot level, and set off the dynamite.|$|E

2500|$|From 2009 to 2013, the Russian {{atomic energy}} agency Rosatom {{acquired}} Uranium One, a Canadian company with global uranium mining stakes including 20percent of the uranium production capacity in the United States. The strategically sensitive acquisition required {{the approval of the}} Canadian government {{as well as a number}} of U.S. governmental bodies including the State Department. In April 2015, The New York Times reported that, during the acquisition, the family foundation of Uranium One's chairman made $2.35 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. Also during this time, Bill Clinton received a $500,000 payment from Renaissance Capital, a Russian investment bank whose analysts were praising Uranium One stock, for making speech in Moscow. The Foundation donations were not publicly disclosed by the Clinton Foundation or the State Department, despite a prior agreement to do so, in part due to taking advantage of the donations going through a Canadian affiliate of the Foundation. A FactCheck.org analysis stated that while the reports raised [...] "legitimate questions about the Clinton Foundation and its donations," [...] the reports [...] "presented no evidence that the donations influenced Clinton's official actions." [...] Asked about the issue in June 2015, the former secretary said of the State Department's role in the approval, [...] "There were nine government agencies that that had to sign <b>off</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> deal. I was not personally involved because that's not something [...] Secretary of State did." ...|$|E

The Western cities lie open, and though the life in them is more suggestive of that of Paris than the staidness of an English town, they have neither gate nor barrier, and are usually ready to welcome all who care to enter: strong-armed men who limp in, red with dust, in dilapidated shoes, as well as purchasers of land and commercial enterprise directors. They have, it frequently happens, need of the one, and a bonus instead of taxes to offer the other, who may purpose to set up mills and workshops within their borders.|$|E
