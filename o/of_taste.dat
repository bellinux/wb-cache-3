40|$|In a {{discrete}} choice situation, {{information about the}} <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> each sampled customer is inferred from estimates of the distribution <b>of</b> <b>tastes</b> in the population. First, maximum likelihood procedures are used to estimate the distribution <b>of</b> <b>tastes</b> in the population using the pooled data for all sampled customers. Then, the distribution <b>of</b> <b>tastes</b> <b>of</b> each sampled customer is derived conditional on the observed data for that customer and the estimated population distribution <b>of</b> <b>tastes</b> (accounting for uncertainty in the population estimates.) We apply the method to data on residential customers' choice among energy suppliers in conjoint-type experiments. The estimated distribution <b>of</b> <b>tastes</b> provides practical information that is useful for suppliers in designing their offers. The conditioning for individual customers is found to differentiate customers effectively for marketing purposes and to improve considerably the predictions in new situations. ...|$|R

5000|$|ChicagoFest, {{started by}} mayor Michael Bilandic, was the {{precursor}} to the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Chicago. After Bilandic's tenure in office, newly elected Mayor Jane Byrne attempted to end the festival {{as well as many}} other programs associated with the former mayor. Many Chicagoans disapproved of Mayor Byrne's attempt to stop the festivities (although attendance at ChicagoFest had begun to wane). She and her successor, Mayor Harold Washington, dedicated more time and energy to promoting the Taste, slowly phasing ChicagoFest out in the process. Mayor Washington finally put an end to ChicagoFest when in 1983 it was moved from Navy Pier to Soldier Field and attendance continued to wane. The popularity <b>of</b> the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Chicago has prompted other cities to spawn numerous offshoots and equivalents throughout the United States, such as the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Champaign, CityFest in Detroit, the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> the Danforth in Toronto, the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Kalamazoo, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Addison, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Denver, <b>Taste</b> in Dallas, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Madison, <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Austin, the <b>Taste</b> <b>of</b> Peoria in Peoria, Illinois, and the Bite in Portland to name a few.

5|$|Horses have an {{advanced}} sense <b>of</b> <b>taste,</b> which {{allows them to}} sort through fodder and choose what they would most like to eat, and their prehensile lips can easily sort even small grains.

5|$|Potassium can be {{detected}} by taste because it triggers {{three of the five}} types <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> sensations, according to concentration. Dilute solutions of potassium ions taste sweet, allowing moderate concentrations in milk and juices, while higher concentrations become increasingly bitter/alkaline, and finally also salty to the taste. The combined bitterness and saltiness of high-potassium solutions makes high-dose potassium supplementation by liquid drinks a palatability challenge.|$|E

Chemical sensors provide equivalents <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and smell, often by means of setae.|$|E
5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the olfactory bulb, but they do have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense <b>of</b> <b>taste.</b> They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|E

5|$|Part {{of the new}} {{genre of}} the Romantic travel narrative, History of a Six Weeks' Tour exudes spontaneity and enthusiasm; the authors {{demonstrate}} their desire to develop a sense <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and distinguish themselves from those around them. The romantic elements of the work would have hinted at the text's radical politics to nineteenth-century readers. However, the text's frank discussion of politics, including positive references to the French Revolution and praise of Enlightenment philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, was unusual for a travel narrative at the time, particularly one authored primarily by a woman.|$|E

5|$|Teleosts possess highly {{developed}} sensory organs. Nearly all daylight fish have colour vision {{at least as}} good as a normal human's. Many fish also have chemoreceptors responsible for acute senses <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and smell. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Fish sense sounds in a variety of ways, using the lateral line, the swim bladder, and in some species the Weberian apparatus. Fish orient themselves using landmarks, and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Experiments with mazes show that fish possess the spatial memory needed to make such a mental map.|$|E

Spiders also have in the joints of their limbs slit sensillae that detect forces and vibrations. In web-building spiders, all these mechanical and chemical sensors are more important than the eyes, while the eyes are most important to spiders that hunt actively.|$|E
5|$|David's {{private life}} was less felicitous. In April 1963 her affair with Higgins {{came to an}} end when he remarried. For a period she drank too much brandy and resorted too often to {{sleeping}} pills.

She kept the news of the event within her close circle of friends—none of the editors of the publications she worked for were aware of the collapse—as she did not want her reputation as a hard worker to be damaged. She recovered, but her confidence was badly shaken and her sense <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> was temporarily affected; for a period she could not taste salt, or the effect salt had on what she was cooking, but her sense of smell of frying onions was so enhanced as to be unpleasant for her.|$|E

Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have the Ampullae of Lorenzini, organs that detect weak electric currents on the order of millivolt. Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication.|$|E
5|$|Sugar was {{a luxury}} in Europe until the 18th century, {{when it became}} more widely available. It then became popular and by the 19th century, sugar came to be {{considered}} a necessity. This evolution <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and demand for sugar as an essential food ingredient unleashed major economic and social changes. It drove, in part, colonization of tropical islands and nations where labor-intensive sugarcane plantations and sugar manufacturing could thrive. The demand for cheap labor to perform the hard work involved in its cultivation and processing increased the demand for the slave trade from Africa (in particular West Africa). After slavery was abolished, there was high demand for indentured laborers from South Asia (in particular India). Millions of slave and indentured laborers were brought into the Caribbean and the Americas, Indian Ocean colonies, southeast Asia, Pacific Islands, and East Africa and Natal. The modern ethnic mix of many nations that have been settled in the last two centuries has been influenced by the demand for sugar.|$|E
5|$|The poet, {{of whose}} works I have {{undertaken}} the revision, may now begin {{to assume the}} dignity of an ancient, and claim the privilege of established fame and prescriptive veneration. He has long outlived his century, the term commonly fixed as the test of literature merit. Whatever advantages he might once derive from personal allusions, local customs, or temporary opinions, have for many years been lost; and every topic of merriment, or motive of sorrow, which the modes of artificial life afforded him, now only obscure the scenes which they once illuminated. The effects of favour and competition are at an end; the tradition of his friendships and his enmities has perished; his works support no opinion with arguments, nor supply any faction with invectives; they can neither indulge vanity nor gratify malignity; but are read without any other reason than the desire of pleasure, and are therefore praised only as pleasure is obtained; yet, thus unassisted by interest or passion, they have past through variation <b>of</b> <b>taste</b> and changes of manners, and, as they devolved {{from one generation to}} another, have received new honours at every transmission.|$|E
