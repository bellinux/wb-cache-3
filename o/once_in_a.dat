Portsmouth successfully avoided relegation close to the end of the season, following a 2–0 loss away at Manchester City on 30 April.

In only his second start of the season, he struck out a career high ten batters against the San Diego Padres in a game the Giants eventually won 1–0. Sánchez struck out ten batters again in a 3–1 victory against the Cincinnati Reds on April 25, becoming the first Giants left-handed pitcher since Shawn Estes to strike out at least ten batters in a game more than <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> season. From May 28 through June 12, Sánchez won a career best four straight starts. On June 12, in a 10–7 victory over the Colorado Rockies, {{he became the first}} Giants' starter to allow seven runs and win a game since Russ Ortiz did it in 2000. In his next start, on June 17 against the Detroit Tigers, Sánchez took a no-hitter into the sixth inning, but he was ultimately the losing pitcher in a 5–1 loss. Sánchez finished the first half with an 8–5 record and 115 strikeouts, which were the most ever {{in the first half of}} a season by a Giants' left-hander during the Giants' tenure in San Francisco.|$|E

5|$|In {{his next}} project, 127 Hours, {{directed}} by Danny Boyle, Franco portrayed real-life mountain climber Aron Ralston. It {{was given a}} limited release starting on November 5, 2010. 127 Hours centered on Ralston trying to free his hand after it became trapped under a boulder in a ravine while canyoneering alone in Utah and resorting to desperate measures in order to survive, eventually amputating his arm. During the five-week, 12-hours-per-day shoot, Franco would only leave the gully set to use the lavatory and would read books such as academic textbooks to keep busy. Franco later called making 127 Hours a <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> lifetime experience. To date, 127 Hours {{is one of his}} most well-reviewed movies and was also a commercial success, earning $60.7million against an $18million budget. His performance earned him universal acclaim from critics. Subsequently, he was nominated for an Academy Award, Golden Globe and SAG award, as well as winning an Independent Spirit Award.|$|E

Qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012 started in a similar way, the first nine matches all being defeats with an aggregate of 49 goals conceded and none scored, their best result being a one-goal loss to Finland at home, with the worst being a heavy 11–0 loss to the Netherlands, which became the Netherlands' highest scoring victory of all time and San Marino's worst-ever away defeat. This was then followed up by two lighter defeats, a 5–0 home loss against Sweden, before completing the campaign with a 4–0 away loss to Moldova.|$|E

5|$|Six teams {{competed for}} the T20 title {{which took place}} between 30 July and 21 August 2016. The six teams played each other <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> round robin format; {{followed}} by a finals day at the County Cricket Ground, Chelmsford. The team that finished top of the table during the group stage qualified directly for the final, while the teams in second and third qualified for a semi-final. Both the semi-final and the final were played {{on the same day}} at the same ground. This was a change in format from the original proposal, in which the top four team qualified for the semi-finals. During the group stage, teams scored two points for a win, but gained an additional bonus point if they scored at a run rate 1.25 or more times that of their opponent.|$|E
5|$|The Blazers {{finished}} the 2014 season with 21 more wins {{than the previous}} season, which amounted for the largest single-season improvement in franchise history. This included a period in November when they won 11 straight games, and 13–2 in the month overall, for which coach Terry Stotts took home Coach of the Month honors. On December 12, 2013, Aldridge scored 31 points and pulled down 25 rebounds in a home game against the Rockets, {{the first time a}} Trail Blazer recorded a 30-point, 25-rebound game. On December 14, 2013, the Blazers made a franchise-record 21 three-pointers against the Philadelphia 76ers. They tied the new record 19 days later against the Charlotte Bobcats, becoming the first NBA team to make 20 or more three-pointers in a game more than <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> season. Lillard was voted in as a reserve to his first All-Star game, joining Aldridge to represent Portland at the game. Portland finished 54–28, securing the fifth seed in the playoffs against the Rockets. The team also shot 81.5% at the free throw line, made 770 three pointers, and started four players for all 82 regular-season games, all franchise records.|$|E

He felt that political campaigns oriented towards recent immigrants and people whose first language is not English, would empower those communities to become more politically active.|$|E

5|$|The {{dismissal}} ended another low-scoring innings, and Australia batted only <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> shortened match.

Morris—who had established himself as one of Australia's first-choice opening batsmen during Brown's injury layoff during the previous season—was rested for the Fifth Test as the Australian Board trialled potential candidates for the 1948 tour of England. Morris was omitted after losing a coin toss to Barnes. Brown partnered Barnes, making 99 in the first innings before being run out. Brown had survived a confident appeal for caught behind before he had scored, and Barnes was convinced that his partner had edged the ball. Barnes claimed that had Brown failed to make an impact in the innings, he would have been overlooked for the 1948 tour.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{of the very few}} chairs which have come down from a remote antiquity is the reputed Chair of Saint Peter in St Peter's Basilica at Rome. The wooden {{portions}} are much decayed, but it would appear to be Byzantine work of the 6th century, and to be really an ancient sedia gestatoria. It has ivory carvings representing the labours of Hercules. A few pieces of an earlier oaken chair have been let in; the existing one, Gregorovius says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curile chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily apocryphal. It is not, as is popularly supposed, enclosed in Gian Lorenzo Bernini's bronze chair, but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only <b>once</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> century. Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of chair, and in addition to lions’ heads and winged figures of Victory (or Nike) and dolphin-shaped arms used also the lyre-back which has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival {{of the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E
