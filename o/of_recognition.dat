5|$|Alison Young {{argues that}} Jackson entrenched section 2(1) of the Parliament Act 1911 by {{requiring}} {{that it only}} be overturned by adopting a specific manner and form (approval of the bill changing the 1911 Act by the House of Lords). She suggests that Lord Steyn and Baroness Hale would explain this result using a self-embracing view of sovereignty – that Parliament {{as a whole is}} sovereign and can therefore to bind later parliaments. The passing of the 1911 Act was from this perspective a redefinition of Parliament that binds the courts. However, she notes that Lord Hope, Lord Nicholls and Lord Carswell provide an alternative explanation for the decision: that the 1911 Act modified the rule <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> defining valid legal documents. Under this view, the 1911 Parliament did not bind future Parliaments simply by passing the Parliament Act 1911, but by the legislation being recognised, in political fact, as valid; the courts were therefore altering the legal rule <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> accordingly. This perspective allows the orthodox continuing view of parliamentary sovereignty (that every new parliament is sovereign) to be held while still explaining why future parliaments cannot modify section 2(1) of the 1911 Act.|$|E

5|$|In {{figure at}} left, the various {{segments}} {{that form the}} epitope {{have been shown to}} be continuously collinear, meaning that they have been shown as sequential; however, for the situation being discussed here (i.e., the antigen recognition by the B cell), this explanation is too simplistic. Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence (line). This mode <b>of</b> <b>recognition</b> is possible only when the peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E

40|$|We {{aimed at}} verifying the {{hypothesis}} that facial mimicry is causally and selectively involved in emotion recognition. For this purpose, in Experiment 1, we explored the effect of tonic contraction of muscles in upper or lower half of participants' face {{on their ability to}} recognize emotional facial expressions. We found that the "lower" manipulation specifically impaired <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> happiness and disgust, the "upper" manipulation impaired <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> anger, while both manipulations affected <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> fear; <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> surprise and sadness were not affected by either blocking manipulations. In Experiment 2, we verified whether emotion recognition is hampered by stimuli in which an upper or lower half-face showing an emotional expression is combined with a neutral half-face. We found that the neutral lower half-face interfered with <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> happiness and disgust, whereas the neutral upper half impaired <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> anger; <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> fear and sadness was impaired by both manipulations, whereas <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> surprise was not affected by either manipulation. Taken together, the present findings support simulation models <b>of</b> emotion <b>recognition</b> and provide insight into the role of mimicry in comprehension of others' emotional facial expressions...|$|R
