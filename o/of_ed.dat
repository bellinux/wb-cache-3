40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether frequent users <b>of</b> emergency department (<b>ED)</b> services use more or fewer primary care services than other ED patients. DESIGN: Population-based, observational, cross-sectional study. SETTING: Province of Ontario in 1997 - 1998. PARTICIPANTS: Frequent users <b>of</b> <b>EDs,</b> defined as people {{with at least}} 12 ED physician assessments yearly, were compared with those with one to 11 assessments yearly. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Number of general practitioner and family physician (GP/FP) office visits and number of GP/FPs visited; diagnoses made during office visits; referrals by GP/FPs to specialists. RESULTS: Three quarters of frequent users <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> visited GP/FPs at least six times yearly, {{and more than half}} visited at least 12 times yearly. Although frequent users <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> saw many GP/FPs (4. 2 vs 1. 6 in the control group, P <. 001), they received, on average, 73 % of their primary care from the GP/FPs whom they saw most frequently. Frequent users <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> also had more referrals to specialists (4. 0 vs 1. 0). Frequent users <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> were more likely to live in low socioeconomic neighbourhoods and to be diagnosed with psychosocial conditions (24. 1 % vs 11. 1 %). CONCLUSION: Most frequent users <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> have periodic contact with primary care physicians. Communication and coordination <b>of</b> care between <b>EDs</b> and primary care settings could be easier than anticipated, because in most cases, frequent users <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> seek most <b>of</b> their care from one main ED and one primary care physician...|$|R

5|$|In Novi, Virginia, a {{group of}} ex-convicts, led by Dr. Lisa Holland (Katy Boyer), meet and discuss atoning for their sins. Terry Pruit (Don Swayze) tells the others that, since he has {{discovered}} the group, he has made amends for his past. However, another member, Ed (Cyril O'Reilly), tells him that humans are unable to change {{and that they are}} both destined for hell. Ed's friend, Victor Potts (David Figlioli), tells Holland that he's been having nightmares involving people being skinned alive. That night, he has a vision <b>of</b> <b>Ed</b> skinned. Several hours later, Victor is murdered. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) asks John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to examine Potts' body. Reyes explains that, because Potts had a premonition of his death, the case is an X-File. Meanwhile, at a butchery, Terry and Ed get into an argument. Terry later has a vision—similar to Victor's—in which Ed is skinned alive. That night, he is attacked and brutally flayed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Endocrine {{disruptors}} (<b>EDs)</b> are <b>of</b> global concern {{owing to}} their widespread occurrence and {{adverse effect on}} reproductive systems of animals and humans. The sorption behaviour <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> is <b>of</b> fundamental importance in determining their transport and fate, but the influence of solution chemistry (ion species and concentration) on the sorption process is poorly understood. In the present study, the effects of Ca 2 + and Na+ on the sorption <b>of</b> three selected <b>EDs</b> (bisphenol A, 17 β-oestradiol and 17 α-ethynylestradiol) to sediments were investigated. Fluorescence spectra <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> were measured to reveal the interactions <b>of</b> ions with <b>EDs.</b> The sorption <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> to sediments increases with rising ion concentration, and Ca 2 + has a greater influence on sorption than Na+. Two characteristic excitation–emission peaks {{were found in the}} three-dimensional fluorescence spectra. For the selected EDs, a strong reduction in intensity of these two peaks was observed after the addition of ions. These results indicate that solution chemistry has a major influence on the sorption <b>of</b> selected <b>EDs</b> to sediments; greater sorption occurs with higher ion concentration...|$|R
40|$|Objective. Despite {{evidence}} from case series, the comorbidity <b>of</b> eating disorders (<b>EDs)</b> with schizophrenia is poorly understood. This review aimed {{to assess the}} {{epidemiological and clinical characteristics}} <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> in schizophrenia patients and to examine whether the management <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> can be improved. Methods. A qualitative review of the published literature was performed using the following terms: “schizophrenia” in association with “eating disorders,” “anorexia nervosa,” “bulimia nervosa,” “binge eating disorder,” or “night eating syndrome. ” Results. According to our literature review, there is a high prevalence of comorbidity between schizophrenia and EDs. EDs may occur together with or independent of psychotic symptoms in these patients. Binge eating disorders and night eating syndromes are frequently found in patients with schizophrenia, with a prevalence of approximately 10 %. Anorexia nervosa seems to affect between 1 and 4 % of schizophrenia patients. Psychopathological and neurobiological mechanisms, including effects of antipsychotic drugs, should be more extensively explored. Conclusions. The comorbidity <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> in schizophrenia remains relatively unexplored. The clearest message of this review is the importance of screening for and assessment <b>of</b> comorbid <b>EDs</b> in schizophrenia patients. The management <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> in schizophrenia requires a multidisciplinary approach to attain maximized health outcomes.

5|$|Kurosawa had {{meanwhile}} instructed Toho {{to purchase}} the film rights to King's Ransom, a novel about a kidnapping written by American author and screenwriter Evan Hunter, under his pseudonym <b>of</b> <b>Ed</b> McBain, {{as one of his}} 87th Precinct series of crime books. The director intended to create a work condemning kidnapping, which he considered one of the very worst crimes. The suspense film, titled High and Low, was shot during the latter half of 1962 and released in March 1963. It broke Kurosawa's box office record (the third film in a row to do so), became the highest grossing Japanese film of the year, and won glowing reviews. However, his triumph was somewhat tarnished when, ironically, the film was blamed for a wave of kidnappings which occurred in Japan about this time (he himself received kidnapping threats directed at his young daughter, Kazuko). High and Low is considered by many commentators to be among the director's strongest works.|$|E
5|$|Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and Peter Dunlop (Nicholas Bishop) {{arrive at}} the scene <b>of</b> <b>Ed</b> Russell (David Shumbris), a stay at home father, who is found by his wife Jen (Molly Price) stabbed to death at their house, whilst their baby {{daughter}} Sophie is at home. When Detective Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) goes to tell Ed's son Mike (Jake O'Connor) about his father’s death, Megan stops him, telling Bud to let his mother tell him. Megan has a flashback to when she was younger, focussing on when a young Megan (Madeline Milne) receives the news of her father’s death from a policeman, as the police {{did not know where}} her mother, Joan (Joanna Cassidy), was at the time. Jen admits that she cleaned up some footprints; she thought they were Mike's. The attack on Ed was personal and after Detective Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) concludes that the attack on Ed was personal after she finds evidence to suggest Mike did indeed kill his father, such as negative emails. Mike protests his innocence, and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) finds evidence which makes Mike innocent. Throughout the day, Megan tries to rebuild her relationship with Lacey (Mary Mouser), carpooling Lacey and her friends, Sarah (Teresa Celentano) and Betsy (Anna Friedman).|$|E
5|$|With 16 points through 20 {{games with}} the Moose, Bieksa was called up by the Canucks and played his first NHL game on December 19, 2005, against the Los Angeles Kings.

The following month, he notched his first NHL point, an assist to Markus Näslund, in a 3–2 win against the Chicago Blackhawks on January 5, 2006. He remained with the Canucks until {{near the end of}} the season, as he was reassigned to the Moose on April 8 to make room for the return <b>of</b> <b>Ed</b> Jovanovski from injury. Bieksa finished the season with six assists in 39 games for the Canucks, averaging 16 minutes of ice-time per game. On August 17, 2006, he was re-signed by the Canucks to a two-year, one-way, $1.05 million contract.|$|E

5|$|Zoldak {{was moved}} to a relief role {{full-time}} for the 1949 Cleveland Indians season {{due to a lack}} of depth with the departures <b>of</b> <b>Ed</b> Klieman and Russ Christopher. On July 27, Zoldak managed to hit his only career home run against the New York Yankees off Ed Lopat. However, the game was rained out, and the only home run of his career was erased. In 27 games that season, Zoldak had a 12 record with a 4.25 ERA. Zoldak had struggled in spring training the prior year due to both being out of shape and a lack of pitching control, but was impressive enough in 1950 after losing the weight and regaining his control that manager Lou Boudreau decided to put him in the starting rotation to begin the year. He pitched poorly in his first starts, and was placed back in the bullpen for the rest of the year; Indians management considered demoting him to the minor leagues, and would have been sent to the San Diego Padres in May if not for the intervention of Johnny Berardino, who wanted to play on the west coast and agreed to a demotion instead. Zoldak spent the full season with Cleveland, and had a 42 record and a 3.96 ERA in 33 games.|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{understand}} how young men recognise eating disorder (ED) symptoms {{and decide to}} seek help, and to examine their experiences of initial contacts with primary care. Design A qualitative interview study. Setting Men from across the UK were interviewed {{as part of a}} study of 39 young men's and women's experiences <b>of</b> having an <b>ED.</b> Participants 10 men aged 16 – 25  years with various EDs including anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Results The widespread perception <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> as uniquely or predominantly a female problem led to an initial failure by young men to recognise their behaviours as symptoms <b>of</b> an <b>ED.</b> Many presented late in their illness trajectory when ED behaviours and symptoms were entrenched, and some felt that opportunities to recognise their illness had been missed because of others’ lack <b>of</b> awareness <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> in men. In addition, the men discussed the lack of gender-appropriate information and resources for men with EDs as an additional impediment to making sense of their experiences, and some felt that health and other professionals had been slow to recognise their symptoms because they were men. Conclusions Although increasingly common in young men, widespread cultural constructions <b>of</b> <b>EDs</b> as a ‘women's illness’ mean that men may fail to recognise ED symptoms until disordered behaviours become entrenched and less tractable to intervention. Men also report that such perceptions can affect the reactions of their families and friends, as well as health and educational professionals. Primary care professionals are well placed to challenge inappropriate perceptions <b>of</b> <b>EDs...</b>|$|R
