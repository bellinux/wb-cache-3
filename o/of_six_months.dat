5|$|Since the tribunes were {{considered}} to be the embodiment of the plebeians, they were sacrosanct. Their sacrosanctity was enforced by a pledge, taken by the plebeians, to kill any person who harmed or interfered with a tribune during his term of office. All of the powers of the tribune derived from their sacrosanctity. One consequence was that it was considered a capital offense to harm a tribune, to disregard his veto, or to interfere with a tribune. In times of military emergency, a dictator would be appointed for a term <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> Constitutional government would be dissolved, and the dictator would be the absolute master of the state.

Considering the screenplay a way to encourage the younger generation to study Indonesian history, which she said could be fun, Utami decided to focus on education, diversity, and history.|$|E

5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Gandhi {{decided to}} promote Manekshaw to the rank of field marshal and {{subsequently}} appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). However, after several objections from the bureaucracy, and the commanders of the navy and the air force, the appointment was dropped. It was felt that, as Manekshaw was from the army, as comparatively smaller forces the navy and air force would be neglected. Moreover, bureaucrats felt that it might challenge their influence over defence issues. Though Manekshaw was to retire in June 1972, his term was extended by a period <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> On 3 January 1973, Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

5|$|Most of the {{casualties}} and damage were caused by a tsunami affecting the west coasts of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, {{and it was one}} of three tsunamis to occur within a span <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> Runup heights were measured shortly after the earthquake and reached heights of up to 9.9 meters, though the average height was 3 to 8 meters. The tsunami was disproportionately large for its surface wave magnitude, or Ms, and the duration of the rupture process was 100 s, unusually long for its size. The moment magnitude was 7.6, larger than the 20-s Ms of 7; this Ms–Mw difference is a characteristic of tsunami earthquakes. Tide gages were set up at Corinto and Puerto Sandino, which showed an impulsive tsunami originating 61 minutes after the earthquake. It ran inland 1,000 meters to Masachapa, the hardest hit major town of all, with 9 fatalities.|$|E

40|$|Background: External {{validation}} {{on different}} TBI populations {{is important in}} order to assess the generalizability of prognostic models to different settings. We aimed to externally validate recently developed models for prediction <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> unfavourable outcome and <b>six</b> <b>month</b> mortality. Methods: The International Neurotrauma Research Organization - Prehospital dataset (INRO-PH) was collected within an observational study between 2009 - 2012 in Austria and includes 778 patients with TBI of GCS < = 12. Three sets of prognostic models were externally validated: the IMPACT core and extended models, CRASH basic models and the Nijmegen models developed by Jacobs et al - all for prediction <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> unfavourable outcome and <b>six</b> <b>month</b> mortality. The external validity of the models was assessed by discrimination (Area Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve, AUC) and calibration (calibration statistics and plots). Results: Median age in the validation cohort was 50 years and 44 % had an admission GSC motor score of 1 - 3. Six-month mortality was 27 %. Mortality could better be predicted (AUCs around 0. 85) than unfavourable outcome (AUCs around 0. 80). Calibration plots showed that the observed outcomes were systematically better than was predicted for all models considered. The best performance was noted for the original Nijmegen model, but refitting led to similar performance for the IMPACT Extended, CRASH Basic, and Nijmegen models. Conclusions: In conclusion, all the prognostic models we validated in this study possess good discriminative ability for prediction <b>of</b> <b>six</b> <b>month</b> outcome in patients with moderate or severe TBI but outcomes were systemically better than predicted. After adjustment for this under prediction in locally adapted models, these may well be used for recent TBI patients...|$|R
