500|$|Satire {{and comedy}} {{are a major}} aspect of Tenacious D's lyrical content. Gass said of their approach: [...] "I'd love to do the {{straight}} music thing, but that's kind of against <b>our</b> <b>mission,</b> which is to rebel against the serious singer-songwriter mentality." [...] Their songs evoke heavy metal clichés of bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. In particular, the song [...] "Dio" [...] pokes fun {{at the idea of}} a torch being passed. Songs like [...] "Friendship" [...] parody the lack of real friendship, as well as point out the [...] traits in rock groups with the lyric [...] "As long as there's a record deal, we'll always be friends". Tenacious D also employs the technique of deliberate backmasking on [...] "Karate", a technique employed by other metal bands like Slayer, who recorded a message in Hell Awaits.|$|E
500|$|On May 29, 2015, Senator Mark Kirk, Republican of Illinois, {{who served}} in the House {{throughout}} Hastert's tenure as speaker, released a statement reading: [...] "Anyone who knows Denny is shocked and confused by the recent news.

This is a very troubling development that we must learn more about, but I am thinking of his family during this difficult time." [...] On June 4, 2015, Kirk announced that he would donate to charity a $10,000 contribution made to Kirk's 2010 Senate campaign by Hastert's Keep <b>our</b> <b>Mission</b> PAC. Kirk's announcement was made following the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC)'s call upon the senator to [...] "return or donate Denny Hastert's money immediately." [...] The DSCC also called upon Republican Senators John Boozman of Arkansas and Roy Blunt of Missouri (who received $11,000 and $5,000, respectively, from Hastert's PAC in recent years) to return or donate the funds.|$|E
500|$|Members of the LDS Church {{believe that}} Jesus Christ will return in glory in his Second Coming. Howard W. Hunter, who was {{president}} of the church's Quorum of the Twelve {{at the time of the}} center's construction, pointed out that although there would be no proselytizing from the center, it still served a valuable purpose. One church member quoted him this way: [...] "Elder Hunter said that <b>our</b> <b>mission</b> was not to harvest, probably not even to plant, but to clear away a few more stones." [...] Latter-day Saints often see the center as a way for them to show local Jews what the church is about by example, rather than by proselyting. This is done by the way students and faculty at the center live their lives, as well as through the hiring of both Israeli and Palestinian workers, as an example of what can be done through cooperation. During construction of the center, for example, the church hired as many as 300 workers at one time, with about 60% of them being Arab and the other 40% being Jewish. Similar cooperation continues today.|$|E

500|$|Although the Daddies were {{experiencing}} commercial success {{under the guise}} of swing revivalists, having been declared the [...] "leaders" [...] of the movement by Rolling Stone, the band openly contested being labeled a retro act at the exclusion of their dominant ska and punk influences and modernist lyricism. While still vocal supporters of both the swing revival and its bands, the Daddies adamantly tried to disassociate themselves from the swing scene and in particular its nostalgia-based mentality. Perry explained to Spin in July 1998, [...] "it's not <b>our</b> <b>mission</b> to be a swing band. I'm not a guy from the '40s. That's why we play ska and use heavy guitars", noting elsewhere [...] "I can't fully take us out of the retro classification, but we harp on the fact that we're contemporary music". Thusly, the Daddies avoided touring with swing bands, selecting Latin rock group Ozomatli and ska/soul band The Pietasters as support on their first headlining U.S. tour, and opening for Argentine rock band Los Fabulosos Cadillacs on their 1998 North American tour. At one point, the Daddies attempted to arrange a tour with Primus which never materialized; said Perry, [...] "I know there are people who come to our shows who'd like nothing more than for us to play swing 24/7...there are plenty of bands who want to be swing bands and swing bands only. We're trying to find the audience who'll let us write songs and just be who we are".|$|E
500|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the Soviet {{leadership}} headed by Leonid Brezhnev, Alexei Kosygin and the Politburo, were {{not eager to}} send troops to Afghanistan. The Soviet Politburo decisions were guided by a Special Commission on Afghanistan, which consisted of Yuri Andropov the KGB Chairman, Andrei Gromyko the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Defence Minister Dmitriy Ustinov, and Boris Ponomarev, {{the head of the}} International Department of the Central Committee. The Politburo was opposed to the removal of Taraki and his subsequent murder. According to Brezhnev, the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, [...] "Events developed so swiftly in Afghanistan that essentially there was little opportunity to somehow interfere in them. Right now <b>our</b> <b>mission</b> is to determine our further actions, so as to preserve our position in Afghanistan and to secure our influence there." [...] Although Afghan–Soviet relations deteriorated during Amin's short stint in power, he was invited on an official visit to Moscow by Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan, because of the Soviet leadership's satisfaction with his party and state-building policy. Not everything went as planned, and Andropov talked about [...] "the undesirable turn of events" [...] taking place in Afghanistan under Amin's rule. Andropov also brought up the ongoing political shift in Afghanistan under Amin; the Soviets were afraid that Amin would move Afghanistan's foreign policy from a pro-Soviet position to a pro-United States position. By early-to-mid December 1979, the Soviet leadership had established an alliance with Babrak Karmal and Assadullah Sarwari.|$|E

2500|$|Business process {{reengineering}} (BPR) is {{the practice of}} rethinking and redesigning the way work is done to better support an organization's mission and reduce costs.

Basic questions are asked, such as [...] "Does <b>our</b> <b>mission</b> need to be redefined? Are our strategic goals aligned with <b>our</b> <b>mission?</b> Who are our customers?" [...] An organization may find that it is operating on questionable assumptions, particularly {{in terms of the}} wants and needs of its customers.
