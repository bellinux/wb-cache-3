25|$|Early in 2013, SEPTA {{began to}} {{undertake}} major operational improvements and physical rehabilitation on the Manayunk/Norristown Line. Central to {{this project is}} {{the replacement of the}} 80-year-old wayside automatic block signal system with one that displays only in the <b>operating</b> <b>cab,</b> and operates in both directions on both tracks, thereby allowing greater operational flexibility. Two new remotely controlled interlockings are being constructed to facilitate bidirectional operation, one at Miquon, the other in Norristown between the main station and the Ford Street crossing. An electrified storage track is also being constructed at Miquon to allow for temporary turnback of trains at that station, as the line is periodically subjected to flooding from the Schuylkill River around Spring Mill and Conshohocken. Ongoing replacement of the line's overhead catenary, most of which is 80 years old, will continue along with the signal replacement. Also occurring in conjunction with these projects are the replacement of crossties, renewal of grade crossing surfaces, and trimming of brush and trees alongside the right-of-way. The entire program is scheduled for completion in fall 2015, tying in with the FRA-mandated nationwide implementation of Positive Train Control (PTC) on American railroads by the end of 2015.|$|E
2500|$|TriMet's {{fleet of}} commuter-rail cars {{consists}} of three powered cars and one [...] "control trailer", a type of car which is unpowered but has an <b>operating</b> <b>cab</b> {{at one end and}} can control the powered car to which it is coupled. The trailer can be pulled or pushed. The self-propelled diesel cars do not require a locomotive or overhead electrical wires. Each of the three powered rail cars seat 74passengers, while the unpowered car seats 80. The cars are numbered 1001–1003 (powered) and 2001 (trailer) in TriMet's fleet of vehicles. Originally priced at $4 million each prior to cost overruns, the cars are equipped with places for two mobility devices and two hanging bicycle racks, and have enough space for 139 standing passengers. In a two-car train, passengers can pass between the two connected cars. Interiors of both car types contain high-back seats with blue upholstery.|$|E
25|$|The Broad Street Line uses cars {{built by}} Kawasaki between 1982 and 1984. These cars, known as B-IV {{as they are}} the fourth {{generation}} used on the line, are stainless steel and include some cars with <b>operating</b> <b>cabs</b> at both ends, {{as well as some}} with only a single cab.|$|R
50|$|A {{bi-directional}} {{vehicle is}} {{a vehicle that}} can be driven in either direction, forwards or backwards. Usually, the term refers to rail vehicles, such as trains or trams, that are equipped with <b>operating</b> <b>cabs</b> at both ends.

50|$|A uni-directional {{vehicle is}} {{a vehicle that}} is {{normally}} designed to operate only in the forward direction. While {{the vast majority of}} road vehicles are like this, the term generally refers to a train or tram with a distinguishable front and rear end and a single <b>operating</b> <b>cab</b> at the front end. These vehicles often have the capability to operate in reverse, though such operations are limited to low speeds and short distances, such as shunting.|$|E
5000|$|The Pacific Surfliner uses a {{fleet of}} [...] "Surfliner" [...] bi-level, {{high-capacity}} passenger cars owned by Amtrak (AMTK) and the California Department of Transportation (CDTX). Each trainset has a business class car, three coach cars, a coach/café car with food sales on the lower level, and a coach/baggage/cab car equipped with coach seating, a checked baggage space on the lower level, and engineer's <b>operating</b> <b>cab</b> and headlights on one end, allowing the train to be operated in push-pull mode.|$|E

50|$|These {{telescopic}} cranes are single-engine machines, {{with the}} same engine powering the undercarriage and the crane, similar to a crawler crane. In a rough terrain crane, the engine is usually mounted in the undercarriage {{rather than in the}} upper, as with crawler crane. Most have 4 wheel drive and 4 wheel steering which allows them to traverse tighter and slicker terrain than a standard truck crane with less site prep. In addition, there are rough terrain cranes with the <b>operating</b> <b>cab</b> mounted on the lower as opposed to the P&H in the above image.|$|E
50|$|Many, but not all, newer {{commuter}} railways offer service {{during peak}} times only. For example, the West Coast Express commuter rail line runs trains only into Downtown Vancouver {{during the morning}} rush hour, {{and out to the}} suburbs during the evening rush hour. This mode of operation is, in many cases, simplified by ending the train with a special passenger carriage (referred to as a cab car), which has an <b>operating</b> <b>cab</b> and can control the locomotive remotely, to avoid having to turn the train around at each end of its route. Other systems avoid the problem entirely by using bi-directional multiple units.|$|E
5000|$|The GE BQ23-7 was a {{model of}} diesel {{locomotive}} manufactured by General Electric, {{a variant of the}} B23-7 [...] built between 1978 and 1979 (the 'Q' stood for [...] "crew Quarters"). Mechanically identical to a regular B23-7, but equipped with an enlarged <b>operating</b> <b>cab</b> for accommodating the train crew, thus making a case for eliminating the caboose from the rear of freight trains. SCL no.5130-5139 were the only ones built. Following a practice dating back to ACL and SAL U30Bs of 1967, SCL's 10 BQ23-7s and 30 standard B23-7s were delivered riding on reconditioned Blomberg trucks from EMD trade-ins.|$|E
50|$|Most S70 {{vehicles}} are double-ended, with operating controls {{at both ends}} and doors on both sides. An exception is the 40 cars in service on Portland's MAX system, which are single-ended and have cabs at only one end of each car. However, they have doors {{on both sides and}} in service they always operate in pairs, coupled back-to-back, so that each consist has <b>operating</b> <b>cabs</b> at both ends.|$|R
25|$|Passengers {{connecting}} to the Shenandoah Valley {{can use the}} Shenandoah Valley Commuter Bus, which connects to the Vienna and Rosslyn Metro stations. Washington Flyer was given a monopoly to <b>operate</b> <b>cabs</b> from Dulles Airport, as no other taxis can take passengers from the airport. SuperShuttle ride sharing vans are also available. A special location exists for Uber and Lyft vehicles to take passengers, but the drivers need a special permit {{and there is an}} additional cost of $4 per trip.|$|R
25|$|On January 21, 2010, the NTSB {{issued a}} press release announcing its {{conclusions}} from {{the investigation into the}} collision. In the report, the NTSB concluded that the cause of the accident was most likely the result of the Metrolink engineer's use of text messaging while on duty, which led to the train being operated through a red signal into the path of the oncoming Union Pacific freight train. The investigation has led the NTSB to recommend that the federal government require the installation of video and audio recording equipment in all locomotive and train <b>operating</b> <b>cabs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Surfliner {{cars were}} {{delivered}} in several types: coach cars, café/coach cars equipped for food sales {{on the lower}} level, business-class cars which have two small galleys to allow an attendant to offer complimentary beverage service, and coach/baggage/cab cars equipped with coach seating, a checked baggage space on the lower level, and engineer's <b>operating</b> <b>cab</b> and headlights on one end, allowing the train to be operated in push-pull mode. All Surfliner cars are equipped with overhead luggage racks, reclining seats with tray tables and footrests, reading lights, restrooms, AmtrakConnect WiFi, 120v power outlets, and a wheelchair ramp. The Surfliner has a maximum speed of 90 mph.|$|E
5000|$|The San Joaquin is {{equipped}} with Amtrak California's fleet of [...] "California Car" [...] bi-level, high-capacity passenger cars owned by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans). Each trainset typically consists of two coach cars, a coach/baggage car, a café (dining) car, and a cab/coach car. The cab/coach car is a similar to other coaches but with an engineer's <b>operating</b> <b>cab</b> and headlights on one end, allowing the train to be operated in push-pull mode, which eliminates the need to turn the train at each end-point. Caltrans {{is in the process}} of refitting the cab/coach cars to have a space on car's lower level for storage for checked luggage and bikes.|$|E

50|$|BX {{units were}} three-car units {{consisting}} of an unpowered trailer between two motorized cars. The two end cars retained their <b>operating</b> <b>cabs</b> {{at the front}} and rear, but blind cabs were made inactive. There was a restriction {{on the use of}} these units; one such unit was not permitted to operate by itself, nor could two of these units operate together in one consist. In addition, for many years they were forbidden to operate on the Manhattan Bridge, but this restriction was lifted when the majority of the units were reassigned to Coney Island to provide for the expanded service via the 60th St. Tunnel Connection on December 1, 1955.|$|R
5000|$|The EMC AB6 was a type {{of diesel}} {{locomotive}} built exclusively for the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (the [...] "Rock Island Line") by General Motors' Electro-Motive Corporation and delivered in June 1940. Two examples were built, numbered #750 and #751. They were built for the Rocky Mountain Rocket passenger train, which travelled as a unified train from Chicago, Illinois, to Limon, Colorado, but then divided; with one section going to Colorado Springs, Colorado, {{and the other to}} Denver, Colorado. The Rock Island desired a locomotive that could look like an integrated part of the train during the Chicago-Limon portion of the route, but could then be operated independently to take three cars to Colorado Springs. A regular, cab-equipped A-unit could have been purchased, but that would have ruined the streamlined look of the train, so the RI had EMC build a flat-fronted locomotive based on an E-series E6B (B unit) but with an <b>operating</b> <b>cab,</b> headlight, pilot, and other features to enable it to operate as an independent locomotive.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to speed and signal rules violations, other causative {{factors in the}} accident cited by the National Transportation Safety Board included: inoperative onboard radios in the Silverliners, and no radios {{at all in the}} heavyweight MUs; an inoperative speedometer on Train 1718; improper operation of the air brake (a full-service brake application rather than an emergency [...] "dumping the air" [...] application) by #1718's engineer once he realized a collision was imminent; and the possible distraction caused by the presence of three other employees in #1718's <b>operating</b> <b>cab.</b> Also, the branch's 50-year-old automatic block signal system was criticized as being inadequate in such a situation; although it worked correctly, the system was not equipped to display cab signal indications or stop the train in event of a speed violation, nor could it allow trains to operate against the current of traffic on either track. [...] SEPTA subsequently resignaled the line to all of these standards using color light wayside signals, first between Arsenal and Secane interlockings in the late 1980s, and then from Secane to Elwyn in the mid-1990s during restoration of double track between Media and Elwyn.|$|E
50|$|Locomotives and {{multiple}} unit cars with <b>operating</b> <b>cabs</b> {{are equipped with}} onboard transmitter coils with the superimposed frequencies 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz. Passive tuned inductors (RLC circuits) are situated at appropriate trackside locations; each inductor resonates {{at one of the}} three frequencies, depending on its location. When the leading end of the train passes over one of the trackside inductors, the inductor's presence is detected by the onboard equipment through a change in magnetic flux. This activates the appropriate onboard circuit and triggers whatever action is required based on the location (e.g., an audible/visual warning, enforced speed limit, or enforced stop).|$|R

5000|$|The term 'long hood forward' is {{not used}} in Britain, as the hood would be {{described}} as a [...] "bonnet" [...] or [...] "engine compartment". Most British diesel locomotives have a cab at each end, so the term does not apply. Where a single-cab design was used, it was designed to be operated long hood forward, but, in practice, it might operate in either direction, like a steam tank locomotive. Apart from shunters, the only single-cab class still in service in Britain is the British Rail Class 20. These are now usually <b>operated</b> <b>cab</b> forward (often in pairs) to give the driver a better view of the track ahead, while some have been fitted with nose-mounted video cameras for use when working long hood forward.|$|R
