2500|$|Linear accelerators emit {{high energy}} X-rays; {{the process is}} usually {{referred}} to as [...] "X-ray therapy" [...] or [...] "photon therapy." [...] The term [...] "gamma ray" [...] is usually reserved for photons that are emitted from a radioisotope such as cobalt-60 (see below). Such radiation is not substantially different from that emitted by high voltage accelerators. In linear accelerator therapy, the emission head (called [...] "gantry") is mechanically rotated around the patient, in a full or partial circle. The table where the patient is lying, the [...] "couch", can also be moved in small linear or angular steps. The combination of {{the movements of the}} gantry and <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> makes possible the computerized planning of the volume of tissue {{that is going to be}} irradiated. Devices with a high energy of 6MeV are the most suitable for the treatment of the brain, due to the depth of the target. The diameter of the energy beam leaving the emission head can be adjusted to the size of the lesion by means of collimators. They may be interchangeable orifices with different diameters, typically varying from 5 to 40mm in 5mm steps, or multileaf collimators, which consist of a number of metal leaflets that can be moved dynamically during treatment in order to shape the radiation beam to conform to the mass to be ablated. [...] Linacs are capable of achieving extremely narrow beam geometries, such as 0.15 to 0.3mm. Therefore, they can be used for several kinds of surgeries which hitherto had been carried out by open or endoscopic surgery, such as for trigeminal neuralgia, etc. The exact mechanism of its effectiveness for trigeminal neuralgia is not known; however, its use for this purpose has become very common. Long-term follow-up data has shown it to be as effective as radiofrequency ablation, but inferior to surgery in preventing the recurrence of pain.|$|E

30|$|Six other {{fracture}} zones (potentially faults) {{were observed}} {{to affect the}} Muschelkalk and the Buntsandstein units in GPK- 1, and the Keuper, Muschelkalk and Buntsandstein in GPK- 2. Compared to Rittershoffen, GPK- 1 does not contain <b>the</b> entire sequence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Muschelkalk, which is reduced by approximately one-third. In fact, the - 40  m <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marnes Bariolées are entirely missing, and <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dolomie à Lingules is affected. In <b>the</b> Buntsandstein, half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> Intermédiaires is missing. In GPK- 2, a considerable portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Keuper is missing because the Argiles de Levallois—Grès du Rhétien, the Marnes Irisées supérieures, the Argiles de Chanville and the Dolomie Limite—Argile de la Lettenkhole—Dolomie Inférieure are absent. The Upper Muschelkalk formation is lacking 5  m <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Calcaire à Entroques which is half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unit. In the Buntsandstein, faulting has removed <b>the</b> conglomeratic base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> Intermédiaires and has affected <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> Intermédiaires, which is missing 27  m. In both wells, for all <b>the</b> other units <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sedimentary sequence, the thicknesses are almost the same. The small variations represent lateral variations in these units.|$|R

30|$|At Soultz-sous-Forêts, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main {{differences}} lays in {{the fact}} that part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tertiary and the quaternary formations are significantly reduced by erosion. Compared to GRT, the wells GPK- 1 and GPK- 2 lack parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Complexe du Plio-Quaternaire. Likewise, they lack the whole Série Grise and <b>the</b> upper part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> de Pechelbronn, both layers from the Oligocene that together represent a cumulative thickness of approximately 524  m in GPK- 1 and 532  m in GPK- 2. The detrital Glaswinkel sequence marks <b>the</b> bottom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Couches</b> de Pechelbronn supérieures. At Soultz-sous-Forêts (GPK- 1 and GPK- 2), this detrital benchmark is approximately 20  m thick, which is twice the thickness obtained at Rittershoffen (GRT- 1). This lateral thickness variation from 20  m at Soultz-sous-Forêts to 9  m at Rittershoffen is explained by <b>the</b> proximal/distal evolution <b>of</b> detrital input from <b>the</b> western shoulder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rift (Duringer 1988). Due to lateral thickness variations, the Zone Dolomitique is thinner at Soultz-sous-Forêts than at Rittershoffen. The reduction is 65.5  m for GPK- 1 and 18.5  m GPK- 2. In fact, Soultz-sous-Forêts is located close to the rift border therefore the Zone Dolomitique is not as thick as at Rittershoffen, which is located more centrally in the basin. Another great difference lies at the Mesozoic/Cenozoic unconformity.|$|R

25|$|Passing is {{the most}} basic and common thread used in goldwork; it {{consists}} of a thin strip of metal wound around a core of cotton or silk.

This is always attached by couching, either one or two threads at a time, and pulled through to the back to secure it. When multiple threads must be laid next to each other, a technique called bricking is used: <b>the</b> position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>couching</b> stitches is offset between rows, producing an appearance similar to a brick wall.

H: 1. 98 m ** Diameter of mound: 40 mDescription: Dromos. The chamber complex is {{approached by a}} north– south-oriented dromos, which takes <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> a rock-cut trench in <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mound and was presumably roofed with stone slabs, although no trace <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof survives. Three rock-cut steps are preserved at the south (outer) end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dromos. ** Antechamber. The antechamber is a narrow tunnel—the rock-cut continuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dromos—with a shallow pitched roof. Doorways at both ends were presumably closed by fitted doorplugs (in both cases pushed up against the south or outer edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> doorways). ** Chamber. Unlike the dromos and antechamber, <b>the</b> long axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber runs east–west instead <b>of</b> north–south, and <b>the</b> shallow pitched roof conforms to the same orientation. Arrayed along <b>the</b> sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber are five rock-cut couches: one on the west, two on the north, one on the east, and one on <b>the</b> east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> south wall. Possibly the tomb was designed specifically for five internments. Had <b>the</b> arrangement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber mirrored that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> east, {{it would have been}} possible to add a sixth couch and to center the chamber on <b>the</b> longitudinal axis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antechamber; but <b>the</b> added <b>couch</b> and <b>the</b> extra effort that would have been required to make a larger, more symmetrically disposed chamber were apparently unnecessary. <b>The</b> <b>couches</b> are not benches but shelves, partially hollowed out underneath, with rock-cut "legs" at <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> individual <b>couches.</b> <b>The</b> hollowing out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> undersides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>couches</b> was apparently purely "aesthetic" in intention; {{it does not seem to}} have served a practical purpose, that is, such as making room for additional internments on the floor. <b>The</b> tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>couches</b> are themselves hollowed out to create sunken beds (interior L: 1. 76 m to 1. 91 m; interior W: 0. 67 m to 0. 69 m; vertical D: 0. 17 m to 0. 18 m; W <b>of</b> lips around <b>the</b> edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beds: 0. 12 m to 0. 14 m). <b>The</b> floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tomb is uneven, but the vertical distance from the highest point on <b>the</b> underside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof to <b>the</b> tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lips <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>couches</b> is 0. 7 m. A final enigmatic feature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber is <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> two oval cuttings in the ceiling (0. 4 m by 0. 6 m), one situated over the floor on <b>the</b> east side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chamber, one over the bed on the west side. These holes seem to have been cut all the way through the ceiling and may have served a practical function—as sockets for masts used as guides in <b>the</b> heaping up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tumulus, for example—or, more likely, a ritual purpose, such as <b>the</b> pouring <b>of</b> libations...|$|R
