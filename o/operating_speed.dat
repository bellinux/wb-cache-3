5|$|The {{last eight}} trains were ordered in 2002 and {{delivered}} in 2004–2006, finalising the fleet of 18 trains. At that point {{it had become}} clear that the speed limits on the rail network were mostly too low for the trains to run at their maximum <b>operating</b> <b>speed,</b> {{even though they were}} chosen specifically to prevent the costly work of straightening existing lines. Work on lines has continued, and, on modernised lines, the speed difference between the Pendolino and non-tilting trains has become minimal. The Sm3 was able to attain its maximum <b>operating</b> <b>speed</b> in regular traffic only in 2006, when a new rail line was opened between Kerava and Lahti and the full Pendolino fleet was available. Seven of the original 23 options never came to be.|$|E
5|$|Fixed-speed loads {{subject the}} motor {{to a high}} {{starting}} torque and to current surges that are up to eight times the full-load current. AC drives instead gradually ramp the motor up to <b>operating</b> <b>speed</b> to lessen mechanical and electrical stress, reducing maintenance and repair costs, and extending {{the life of the}} motor and the driven equipment.|$|E
5|$|Around the 1990s, {{the station}} was modernized. After water shorted out old wires in the station, on March 11, 1999, a major fire {{occurred}} originating in an equipment room on the station's lower level. A 1930s-era relay room, which controlled the interlocking north of the station, was destroyed in the fire. The station was closed for several months, with G service suspended south of Hoyt–Schermerhorn Streets and F trains simply bypassing the station at a lower-than-normal <b>operating</b> <b>speed.</b> Signals and switches at the station were replaced and modernized after the fire, and again in Fall 2008 when the relay room was rebuilt.|$|E

5|$|On 19 August 2011, VR {{announced}} it would start a refurbishment of all its Sm3 units to improve the operating conditions during winter. The work will be done between 2012 and 2014 and will cost 10 million Euros. Alstom will cover half of the expenses. The problematic couplers will be changed to allow trains to be coupled on-the-fly again at intermediate stations. Heaters will be installed in the trains' undercarriages to prevent the formation of ice during the winter. In addition to these modifications, the tilt angle of the bogies will be lowered from the current eight degrees. The <b>operating</b> <b>speed</b> of the train will remain the same. , new couplers have been installed in at least Sm3 units 7x12 and 7x18.|$|E
5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the <b>operating</b> <b>speed.</b> Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external process control signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel method for diagnosing incipient bearing defects under variable <b>operating</b> <b>speeds</b> using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained via the stochastic diagonal Levenberg-Marquardt (S-DLM) algorithm. The CNNs utilize the spectral energy maps (SEMs) of the acoustic emission (AE) signals as inputs and automatically learn the optimal features, which yield the best discriminative models for diagnosing incipient bearing defects under variable <b>operating</b> <b>speeds.</b> The SEMs are two-dimensional maps {{that show the}} distribution of energy across different bands of the AE spectrum. It is hypothesized that the variation of a bearing’s speed would not alter the overall shape of the AE spectrum rather, it may only scale and translate it. Thus, at different speeds, the same defect would yield SEMs that are scaled and shifted versions of each other. This hypothesis is confirmed by the experimental results, where CNNs trained using the S-DLM algorithm yield significantly better diagnostic performance under variable <b>operating</b> <b>speeds</b> compared to existing methods. In this work, the performance of different training algorithms is also evaluated to select the best training algorithm for the CNNs. The proposed method is used to diagnose both single and compound defects at six different <b>operating</b> <b>speeds...</b>|$|R

25|$|Further inefficiencies, such as gearbox losses, {{generator}} and converter losses, {{reduce the}} power delivered by a wind turbine. To protect components from undue wear, extracted power is held constant above the rated <b>operating</b> <b>speed</b> as theoretical power increases at the cube of wind speed, further reducing theoretical efficiency.
