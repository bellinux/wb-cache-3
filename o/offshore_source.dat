40|$|When {{designing}} a sourcing strategy in practice, a key {{task is to}} determine the average order rates placed to each source because that affects cost and supplier management. We consider a firm that has access to a responsive nearshore source (e. g., Mexico) and a low-cost <b>offshore</b> <b>source</b> (e. g., China). The firm must determine an inventory sourcing policy to satisfy random demand over time. Unfortunately, the optimal policy is too complex to allow a direct answer to our key question. Therefore, we analyze a tailored base-surge (TBS) sourcing policy that is simple, used in practice, and captures the classic trade-off between cost and responsiveness. The TBS policy combines push and pull controls by replenishing at a constant rate from the <b>offshore</b> <b>source</b> and producing at the nearshore plant only when inventory is below a target. The constant base allocation allows the offshore facility to focus on cost efficiency, whereas the nearshore facility's quick response capability is utilized only dynamically to guarantee high service. The research goals are to (i) determine the allocation of random demand into base and surge capacity, (ii) estimate corresponding working capital requirements, and (iii) identify and value the key drivers of dual sourcing. We present performance bounds on the optimal cost and prove that economic optimization brings the system into heavy traffic. We analyze the sourcing policy that is asymptotically optimal for high-volume systems and present a simple "square-root" formula that is insightful to answer our questions and sufficiently accurate for practice, as is demonstrated with a validation study. inventory production, stochastic models, applications, probability, stochastic model applications...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{analysis of}} nitrate, phosphate and silicate {{data from the}} Benguela upwelling system. Evidence is presented that suggests denitrification occurring close to shore, and also nutrient trapping. Denitrification leaves an imprint on the water properties {{in terms of a}} nitrate deficit, that is to say nitrate concentrations that are significantly less than predicted by multiplying the phosphate concentrations by the Redfield ratio. It is probable that denitrification also causes a decoupling of nitrate and carbon compared to Redfield processes, and large-scale losses of nitrate in the Benguela which are not accompanied by losses of carbon. Nitrate-driven CO 2 drawdown following upwelling will be less than it might otherwise be, because of denitrification. Nutrient trapping (secondary remineralisation) is apparent as enhanced phosphate concentrations, some of which are several [mu]mol higher than in the <b>offshore</b> <b>source</b> waters for upwelling.

This study was conducted using the philosophical position of post-positivism within the interpretive framework and multiple case studies as a strategy of inquiry and stories of <b>offshore</b> <b>sourcing</b> to China told by three entrepreneurs during in-depth, semi-structured interviews which were analysed. Using the metonymic title of maintaining competitiveness, theoretical constructs developed from the findings were integrated into a framework and discussed in the light of relevant literature. The results suggest that <b>offshore</b> <b>sourcing</b> impacts these firms in two ways.

The most important contribution of this analysis is the finding that {{there are two types of}} offshoring strategic motivation, as identified through factor analysis.

These differences in strategy are significantly associated with the choice of sourcing options, and with the cost savings achieved from offshoring.

40|$|We {{extend the}} dual {{sourcing}} model {{based on the}} newsvendor framework by considering {{the environmental impact of}} transport. In our context, dual sourcing means that a company, e. g. a retailer, uses an offshore and an onshore supplier. We include environmental regulations for transport in the model. Firstly, emission taxes for the transport from the <b>offshore</b> <b>source</b> are considered. It can be shown that with increasing emissions taxes the company sources less from offshore. This improves the environmental performance but the economic performance (expected profit) is severely harmed. Secondly, we propose that an emission trading scheme is valid for transport activities. In this case, the optimal policy {{turns out to be a}} two-sided control-limit policy. If the emission limit (expressed in product units) is set to the minimal offshore order quantity the environmental impact of transport can be reduced while the economic performance is nearly not affected. Thus, from managerial perspective emission trading is preferred to an emission tax on transport. Also from the perspective of policy-making emission trading is reasonable as it helps to limit the negative environmental impact of transport but does not strongly reduce the competitiveness of individual companies.

40|$|Abstract. The tsunami {{phenomenon}} is mainly detected in oceanic domains {{but it can}} also occur in small basins as the Adriatic Sea. The presence of great waves has been recorded a few times in the past centuries on the Adriatic shorelines, therefore this suggests the idea to evaluate which could be the maximum amplitude reached by a possible future tsunami event. In this framework we calculate several synthetic mareograms applying to the shallow water basin case both the theory of modal summation by Panza et al. (2000) and the theory of the Green’s function by Yanovskaya et al. (2003). The first is applied to the case of tsunamis generated by an <b>offshore</b> <b>source,</b> the second to the case of tsunamis generated by an inland source. Both kinds of tsunamigenic events did already occur in the Adriatic domain, as witnessed in many catalogues (Caputo and Faita, 1984; Bedosti and Caputo, 1986; Tinti et al., 2004) and also pointed out in the recent “Catalogue of reported tsunami events in the Adriatic Sea ” (see Appendix). We calculate synthetic mareograms varying those parameters which are the most influencing in tsunami generation, such as magnitude, focal depth, water layer thickness, etc., in order to estimate the expected values of tsunami maximum amplitude and arrival time, in the whole Adriatic basin, for the selected scenarios. ...|$|E

40|$|The study {{examines}} international cooperation in product development in software development organisations. The software industry {{is known for}} its global nature and knowledge-intensity, which makes it an interesting setting to examine international cooperation in. Software development processes are increasingly distributed worldwide, but for small or even medium-sized enterprises, typical for the software industry, such distribution of operations is often possible only in association with crossing the company’s boundaries. The strategic decision-making of companies is likely to be affected by the characteristics of the industry, and this includes decisions about cooperation or sourcing. The objective of this thesis is to provide a holistic view on factors affecting decisions about <b>offshore</b> <b>sourcing</b> in software development. <b>Offshore</b> <b>sourcing</b> refers to a cooperative mode of offshoring, where a firm does not establish its own presence in a foreign country, but utilises a local supplier. The {{study examines}} product development activities that are distributed across organisational and geographical boundaries. The objective can be divided into two subtopics: general reasons for international cooperation in product development and particular reasons for cooperation between Finnish and Russian companies. The focus is on the strategic rationale at the company level, in particular in small and medium-sized enterprises. The theoretical discourse of the study builds upon the literature on international cooperation and networking, with particular focus on cooperation with foreign suppliers and within product development activities. The resource-based view is also discussed, as heterogeneity and interdependency of the resources possessed by different firms are seen as factors motivating international cooperation. Strategically, sourcing can be used to access resources possessed by an industrial network, to enhance the product development of a firm, or to optimise its cost structure. In order to investigate the issues raised by the theoretical review, two empirical studies on international cooperation in software product development have been conducted. The emphasis of the empirical part of the study is on cooperation between Finnish and Russian companies. The data has been gathered through four case studies on Finnish software development organisations and four case studies on Russian offshore suppliers. Based on the material from the case studies, a framework clarifying and grouping the factors that influence <b>offshore</b> <b>sourcing</b> decisions has been built. The findings indicate that decisions regarding <b>offshore</b> <b>sourcing</b> in software development are far more complex than generally assumed. The framework provides a holistic view on factors affecting decisions about <b>offshore</b> <b>sourcing</b> in software development, capturing the multidimensionality of motives for entering offshore cooperation. Four groups of factors emerged from the data: A) strategy-related aspects, B) aspects related to resources and capabilities, C) organisation-related aspects, and D) aspects related to the entrepreneur or management. By developing a holistic framework of decision factors, the research offers in-depth theoreticalunderstanding of <b>offshore</b> <b>sourcing</b> rationale in product development. From the managerial point of view, the proposed framework sums up the issues that a firm should pay attention to when contemplating product development cooperation with foreign suppliers. Understanding different components of sourcing decisions can lead to improved preconditions for strategising and engaging in offshore cooperation.

The ground motion simulations were performed in the frequency band of engineering interest (0. 5 - 20 Hz) by two numerical finite-fault methods: a hybrid deterministic-stochastic method, DSM, used for all of the cases investigated, and a non-stationary stochastic finite-fault simulation method, RSSIM, applied only in the case of Lisbon.

The Gippsland Basin of southeastern Australia is the most energy-rich basin of Australia producing petroleum, gas and brown coal. Three-quarters of the Basin lies offshore and the rest onshore. The basin was initiated as a rift valley, caused by {{the separation of the}} Australian continent from the Antarctic followed by a number of tectonic events throughout the basin history. Early Cretaceous sedimentary rocks form the basement, which is in turn covered with Late Cretaceous to Recent sediment of sand, clay, limestone, and brown coal seams. The total thickness of the in-filling sediments offshore attains up to 6000 m, but onshore is up to 1200 m. There are three main acquifer systems, the Hydrostratigraphic Units 2, 4, and 7, all of which are confined. The two lower aquifer systems, Units 4 and 7, contain high temperature groundwater.

40|$|The coastal {{ocean is}} a {{marginal}} {{region of the}} global ocean, but is home to metabolically intense ecosystems which increase the structural complexity of the benthos. These ecosystems {{have the ability to}} alter the carbon chemistry of surrounding waters through their metabolism, mainly through processes which directly release or consume carbon dioxide. In this way, coastal habitats can engineer their environment by acting as sources or sinks of carbon dioxide and altering their environmental chemistry from the regional norm. In most coastal water masses, it is difficult to resolve the ecosystem effect on coastal carbon biogeochemistry due to the mixing of multiple offshore end members, complex geography or the influence of variable freshwater inputs. The Red Sea provides a simple environment for the study of ecosystem processes at a coastal scale as it contains only one offshore end-member and negligible freshwater inputs due to the arid climate of adjacent land. This work explores the ability of three Red Sea benthic coastal habitats (coral reefs, seagrass meadows and mangrove forests) to create characteristic ecosystem end-members, which deviate from the biogeochemistry of <b>offshore</b> <b>source</b> waters. This is done by both calculating non-conservative deviations in carbonate stocks collected over each ecosystem, and by quantifying net carbonate fluxes (in seagrass meadows and mangrove forests only) using 24 hour incubations. Results illustrate that carbonate stocks over ecosystems conform to broad ecosystem trends, which are different to the offshore end-member, and are influenced by inherited properties from surrounding ecosystems. Carbonate fluxes also show ecosystem dependent trends and further illustrate the importance of sediment processes in influencing CaCO 3 fluxes in blue carbon benthic habitats, which warrants further attention.

This paper is dealing with the sub-project 10, SP 10, Task Programme “Scenario earthquake definitions for three cities”. Finite-fault seismological models are proposed to compute the earthquake scenarios for three urban areas – Istanbul (Turkey), Lisbon (Portugal) and Thessaloniki (Greece). For each case study, ground motion scenarios are developed for the most probable two events with different return periods, locations and magnitudes derived from historical and geological data. In this study, we simulate the accelerometric time series and response spectra for high frequency ground motion in the city of Lisbon and surrounding counties (Metropolitan Area of Lisbon), using two possible earthquake models: the inland source area of Lower Tagus Valley, M 5. 7 (4. 7) and a hypothesis of the <b>offshore</b> <b>source</b> area of the 1755 Lisbon, M 7. 6. The non-stationary stochastic method RSSIM (Carvalho et al. 2004) and a new hybrid stochastic-deterministic approach, DSM (Pacor et al., 2005) are used in order to evaluate the ground shaking and to characterize its spatial variability. Then the site effects are evaluated by means of an equivalent stochastic non-linear one-dimensional ground response analysis of stratified soil profile units properly designed. Results are here presented in terms of PGA maps, for offshore and inland scenarios. The mean and worst shaking scenarios for the Metropolitan Area of Lisbon have been delineated at the bedrock. Local effects amplify the synthetic PGA values by approximately a factor of 2. This means that PGA values computed for bedrock in Lisbon city can increase from 0. 12 g up to 0. 25 g and up to 0. 5 g in surroundings, for the inland scenario, and from 0. 045 g up to 0. 090 g for a M 7. 6 offshore scenario...|$|E
40|$|The {{climate of}} West Antarctica is {{strongly}} influenced by remote forcing from the tropical Pacific. For example, recent surface warming over West Antarctica reflects atmospheric circulation changes over the Amundsen Sea, driven by an atmospheric Rossby wave response to tropical sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Here, it is demonstrated that tropical Pacific SST anomalies also influence the source and transport of marine-derived aerosols to the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Using records from four firn cores collected along the Amundsen coast of West Antarctica, the relationship between sea ice–modulated chemical species and large-scale atmospheric variability in the tropical Pacific from 1979 to 2010 is investigated. Significant correlations are found between marine biogenic aerosols and sea salts, and SST and sea level pressure in the tropical Pacific. In particular, La Niña–like conditions generate an atmospheric Rossby wave response that influences atmospheric circulation over Pine Island Bay. Seasonal regression of atmospheric fields on methanesulfonic acid (MSA) reveals a reduction in onshore wind velocities in summer at Pine Island Bay, consistent with enhanced katabatic flow, polynya opening, and coastal dimethyl sulfide production. Seasonal regression of atmospheric fields on chloride (Cl[superscript −]) reveals an intensification in onshore wind velocities in winter, consistent with sea salt transport from <b>offshore</b> <b>source</b> regions. Both the source and transport of marine aerosols to West Antarctica {{are found to be}} modulated by similar atmospheric dynamics in response to remote forcing.

Challenge are in every level of the electrical engineering work, in the whole system, with the material used, and the way their used. This article introduce the main challenges {{in the domain of}} electrical engineering to solve in case of the exploitation of a HVDC grid...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{examines}} how technology and capital intensity are related with the firm’s global sourcing decision. Firm-level data {{are derived from}} a survey covering all manufacturing industries in Japan without any firm-size threshold. Firms are disaggregated by their make-or-buy decision (in-house or outsourcing) and by their choice of <b>sourcing</b> location (<b>offshore</b> or domestic). Capital-intensive or R&D-intensive firms tend to source in-house from their FDI affiliates rather than outsourcing to independent suppliers. This paper also confirms that high productivity is related with <b>offshore</b> <b>sourcing.</b> These findings are basically robust even after industry and firm-size are controlled for...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} is a {{qualitative}} empirical investigation of the underlying decision process to offshore IT projects. The study is based on interviews of executives in fifteen large to medium size companies. Transactions Costs Theory and a process view of <b>offshore</b> <b>sourcing</b> provided the framework for studying the decision process. The data revealed several factors- the client’s core competency, offshore vendor’s local presence, virtual team management, employee turnover rate, negative publicity in the popular media, modularity of projects, and internal efficiencies achieved {{as a result of}} offshore sourcing-influenced the decision making process.

40|$|Offshore {{outsourcing}} {{has evolved}} modes of operating that vary geographical distance and location {{in an effort}} to change the dynamics of the vendor’s capabilities. Organizations seeking to spread risk through the increasingly wide choices offered through <b>offshore</b> <b>sourcing</b> initiatives need to gain an insight into how distance figures in making these decisions. The literature on IS and outsourcing, however, although it addresses issues such as distance peripherally, does not provide an in-depth problematisation of the concept. An understanding of distance as it relates to offshore outsourcing arrangements may inform the wider concern of how location impacts on offshoring arrangements. This paper will describe two cases of nearshore software...|$|R

First, based on various industrial practices in fashion apparel, we construct the two-echelon manufacturer-retailer analytical fashion supply chain model. Second, by exploring the fashion supply chain with a highly fashionable product, we study how the carbon footprint tax can affect the retailer's optimal choice of sourcing. We further investigate the significance of carbon footprint tax on fashion supply chain management under two commonly adopted contracts, namely the pure wholesale pricing (WP) contract and the markdown money (MM) contract. Our analytical findings illustrate that: (1) under the WP contract case: A properly set carbon footprint tax, which depends on the product's manufacturing and shipping costs, and manufacturer's profit margin, can successfully entice the retailer to source locally. (2) Under the MM contract case where the MM contract {{is set in a}} way that the supply chain is coordinated: (a) If the carbon footprint tax is equal to the difference between the product costs from the local and <b>offshore</b> <b>sourcing,</b> then the optimal MM rates and the optimal supply chain product quantities from the local and <b>offshore</b> <b>sourcing</b> modes are the same. (b) Similar to the WP contract case, we prove analytically that a properly determined carbon footprint tax can always entice the retailer to source locally. Further analysis with extended models under the consideration of having a stochastically larger demand with the local sourcing mode is conducted. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
