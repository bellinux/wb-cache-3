60|$|Jimmy {{pulled up}} his pack and set <b>off.</b> <b>Speed</b> was important, for he {{imagined}} {{he had left}} Deering a larger supply of food than the other knew. Since {{he was going to}} Kelshope, he could get fresh supplies, but Deering could not. Yet if he was longer than he calculated, it would be awkward. Jimmy felt lonely and rather daunted. The shack was small and rude, but the bark walls kept out the wind and in the cold evenings he had liked to sit by the snapping fire.|$|E
6000|$|As for Friedrich, haunted and whipt onwards by {{that scene}} at Feuchtwang, he is {{inwardly}} very busy during this {{latter part of}} the route. Probably there is some progress towards gaining Page Keith, Lieutenant Keith of Wesel's Brother; some hope that Page Keith, at the right moment, can be gained: the Lieutenant at Wesel is kept duly advised. To Lieutenant Katte at Berlin Friedrich now writes, I should judge from Donauworth or Augsburg, [...] "That he has had a scene at Feuchtwang; that he can stand it no longer. That Canstatt being given up, as Katte cannot be there to go across the Kniebiss with us, we will endure till we are near enough the Rhine. Once in the Rhineland, in some quiet Town there, handy for Speyer, for French Landau,"--say Sinzheim; last stage hitherward of Heidelberg, but this we do not write,--"there might it not be? Be, somewhere, it shall and must! You, Katte, the instant you hear that we are <b>off,</b> <b>speed</b> you towards the Hague; ask for 'M. le Comte d'Alberville;' you will know that gentleman WHEN you see him: Keith, our Wesel friend, will have taken the preliminary soundings;--and I tell you, Count d'Alberville, or news of him, will be there. Bring the great-coat with you, and the other things, especially the 1,000 gold ducats. Count d'Alberville at the Hague, if all have gone right:--nay if anything go wrong, cannot he, once across the Rhine, take refuge in the convents in those Catholic regions? Nobody, under the scapulary, will suspect such a heretic as him. Speed, silence, vigilance! And so adieu!" [...] A letter of such purport Friedrich did write; which Letter, moreover, the Lieutenant Katte received: it was not this, it was another, that stuck upon the road, and fell into the Rittmeister's hand. This is the young Prince's ultimate fixed project, brought to birth by that slight accident of dropping the knife at Feuchtwang; [Ranke, i. 304.] and hanging heavy on his mind during this Augsburg drive. At Augsburg, furthermore, [...] "he bought, in all privacy, red cloth, of quantity to make a top-coat;" [...] red, the gray being unattainable in Katte's hands: in all privacy; though the watchful Rochow had full knowledge of it, all the same.|$|E

50|$|The {{crash was}} {{determined}} by police {{to be the result}} of the truck's faulty brakes, but local people expressed anger at that conclusion, claiming that the brakes were just one of a number of factors which led to the disaster. They claimed that the road approaching the bus stop was too narrow and totally unmaintained, resulting in damage to vehicles and allowing the truck to roll straight into the bus station, which had no protection against this type of incident in place such as concrete or metal defences to fend <b>off</b> <b>speeding</b> vehicles.|$|R

50|$|Timing-critical paths are {{constructed}} of short channel length cells, but for non timing-critical paths, the longer channel length cells {{can be used}} to trade <b>off</b> <b>speed</b> for lower leakage. Multiple channel length synthesis achieves up to 30% leakage reduction. One additional usage of longer channel length transistors is for always-on logic and for special power management cells (isolation cells, always on buffers, etc.) where speed is not critical.|$|E
50|$|Older {{multiplier}} architectures {{employed a}} shifter and accumulator to sum each partial product, often one partial product per cycle, trading <b>off</b> <b>speed</b> for die area. Modern multiplier architectures use the Baugh - Wooley algorithm, Wallace trees, or Dadda multipliers {{to add the}} partial products together in a single cycle. The performance of the Wallace tree implementation is sometimes improved by modified Booth encoding {{one of the two}} multiplicands, which reduces the number of partial products that must be summed.|$|E

For reasons that could not be determined in the subsequent investigation, all eight main landing gear wheels remained locked up throughout the takeoff run, preventing the aircraft from reaching a sufficient take <b>off</b> <b>speed.</b> 47 of the 229 passengers and crew on board were killed.|$|E
50|$|The Zero 1 system {{supplied}} the track with a 20 V square wave {{at the local}} mains frequency (50 Hz in the UK, 60 Hz in the US) with a 32-bit control word replacing every third cycle. The decoder module in the locomotive would switch either the positive or the negative half-cycle of the square wave to the motor according to the desired direction of travel. During the transmission of the control word, it would remain switched <b>off.</b> <b>Speed</b> control was achieved by pulse-width modulation, varying {{the width of the}} portion of the half-cycle, which was switched in 14 steps.|$|E

5000|$|The layout {{was for a}} {{long time}} not {{successfully}} proven in an aircraft, even though Custer showed theoretically and experimentally that the principle was capable of vertical flight. Since they were built with conventional rudders needing some minimum airspeed to be functional, none of the aircraft designed by Custer were capable of full vertical takeoff, but instead were characterized as STOL (short takeoff and landing). The required runway for takeoff was very short, however, 200 ft for the CCW-1, 66 ft for the CCW-2, with a take <b>off</b> <b>speed</b> of as low as [...] Full vertical takeoff is theoretically feasible, but would require additional modifications and means of control.|$|E

The backstretch apron was paved in 2015, following a serious incident at the 2015 Saturday support race for the Daytona 500 that injured Kyle Busch, the section of track past the tri-oval to Turn 1 was paved over and barriers realigned to temporarily seal off the road course during oval races.|$|E
