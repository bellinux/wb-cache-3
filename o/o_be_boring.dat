6000|$|Sir Richmond {{suddenly}} remembered Miss Seyffert and half {{turned his face}} towards her. Her forehead was just visible over {{the hood of the}} open coupe. She appeared to be intelligently intent upon the scenery. Then he broke out suddenly into a tirade against the world. [...] "But I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by this jostling unreasonable world. At {{the bottom of my heart}} I am bitterly resentful to-day. This is a world of fools and brutes in which we live, a world of idiotic traditions, imbecile limitations, cowardice, habit, greed and mean cruelty. It is a slum of a world, a congested district, an insanitary jumble of souls and bodies. Every good thing, every sweet desire is thwarted--every one. I have to lead the life of a slum missionary, a sanitary inspector, an underpaid teacher. I <b>am</b> <b>bored.</b> Oh God! how I <b>am</b> <b>bored!</b> I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by our laws and customs. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by our rotten empire and its empty monarchy. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by its parades and its flags and its sham enthusiasms. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by London and its life, by its smart life and by its servile life alike. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by theatres and by books and by every sort of thing that people call pleasure. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by the brag of people and the claims of people and the feelings of people. Damn people! I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by profiteers and by the snatching they call business enterprise. Damn every business man! I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by politics and the universal mismanagement of everything. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by France, by Anglo-Saxondom, by German self-pity, by Bolshevik fanaticism. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by these fools' squabbles that devastate the world. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by Ireland, Orange and Green. Curse the Irish--north and south together! Lord! how I HATE the Irish from Carson to the last Sinn Feiner! And I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by India and by Egypt. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by Poland and by Islam. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by anyone who professes to have rights. Damn their rights! Curse their rights! I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> to death by this year and by last year and by the prospect of next year. I am bored--I am horribly bored--by my work. I <b>am</b> <b>bored</b> by every sort of renunciation. I want to live with the woman I love and I want to work within the limits of my capacity. Curse all Hullo! Damn his eyes!--Steady, ah! The spark!... Good! No skid." ...|$|R

30|$|After obtaining 30 {{waveforms}} on a sound specimen, a 3  mm diameter hole <b>was</b> <b>bored</b> at {{the center}} of a cross section. Then, 30 waveforms were obtained at the cross section of interest. Then, a second hole of the same diameter <b>was</b> <b>bored.</b> The procedure of obtaining a waveform and <b>boring</b> another hole <b>was</b> repeated until the number of holes reached nine. All of the holes penetrated only early wood and were made as close to the center as possible. The holes <b>were</b> <b>bored</b> to a depth of 50  mm. Because holes <b>were</b> <b>bored</b> close to the center, ultrasound always passed through the holes. The contact area was 346  mm 2 (diameter of couplant was 21  mm).|$|R

5000|$|In {{recognition}} of the author's many years {{he thought about the}} form in which the book could be presented to Russian readers and in 2008 moved it into Russian (having supplied the text of twenty years ago by later comments), and only in 2012 he published the Russian edition of the publication. The book was published in Moscow in [...] "Astrel" [...] publishing house. The book used photos from the personal archive of the author. Design of the Russian edition met with sharp criticism of the art director of the publishing house Penguin Books Paul Buckley: [...] "Everything here <b>is</b> <b>boring.</b> Photo <b>is</b> <b>boring,</b> font <b>is</b> <b>boring,</b> layout <b>is</b> <b>boring</b> and who may be interested in such a book In the US?

Paint to barrel matching results in no increase in shot consistency or efficiency.|$|R
