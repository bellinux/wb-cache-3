5|$|Donald Canfield {{detected}} {{records of}} the first significant quantities of atmospheric oxygen just before the first Ediacaran fossils appeared– {{and the presence of}} atmospheric oxygen was soon heralded as a possible trigger for the Ediacaran radiation. Oxygen seems to have accumulated in two pulses; the rise of small, sessile (stationary) organisms seems to correlate with an early <b>oxygenation</b> event, with larger and mobile organisms appearing around the second pulse of <b>oxygenation.</b> However, the assumptions underlying the reconstruction of atmospheric composition have attracted some criticism, with widespread anoxia having little effect on life where it occurs in the Early Cambrian and the Cretaceous.|$|E
5|$|People with TBI are {{provided}} with supplemental oxygen and may need mechanical ventilation. Employment of certain measures such as Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and ventilation at higher-than-normal pressures may be helpful in maintaining adequate <b>oxygenation.</b> However, such measures can also increase leakage of air through a tear, and can stress the sutures in a tear that has been surgically repaired; therefore the lowest possible airway pressures that still maintain <b>oxygenation</b> are typically used. Mechanical ventilation can also cause pulmonary barotrauma when high pressure is required to ventilate the lungs. Techniques such as pulmonary toilet (removal of secretions), fluid management, and treatment of pneumonia are employed to improve pulmonary compliance (the elasticity of the lungs).|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} {{is generally}} considered the best method for airway management under {{a wide variety of}} circumstances, as it provides the most reliable means of <b>oxygenation</b> and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration. However, tracheal intubation requires a great deal of clinical experience to master and serious complications may result even when properly performed.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater {{habitats}} include rivers, streams, lakes, ponds, {{marshes and}} bogs. Although some organisms are found across {{most of these}} habitats, the majority have more specific requirements. The water velocity, its temperature and oxygen saturation are important factors, but in river systems, there are fast and slow sections, pools, bayous and backwaters which provide a range of habitats. Similarly, aquatic plants can be floating, semi-submerged, submerged or grow in permanently or temporarily saturated soils besides bodies of water. Marginal plants provide important habitat for both invertebrates and vertebrates, and submerged plants provide <b>oxygenation</b> of the water, absorb nutrients and {{play a part in}} the reduction of pollution.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{focusing}} on individual organisms, paleoecology examines the interactions between different organisms, such as their places in food chains, and the two-way interaction between organisms and their environment.  One example {{is the development of}} oxygenic photosynthesis by bacteria, which hugely increased the productivity and diversity of ecosystems. This also caused the <b>oxygenation</b> of the atmosphere. Together, these were a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E
5|$|Like most cichlids, such as Oreochromis mossambicus, convicts brood (exhibit {{parental care}} of) both eggs and free-swimming fry. The eggs hatch {{approximately}} 72 hours after fertilization. Until {{that time the}} parents expel intruders and potential egg predators from around the nest. They also fan the eggs, moving water with their fins over the clutch to provide <b>oxygenation.</b> They fan the eggs both day and night; at night they use their sense of smell to recognize {{the presence of the}} eggs in the dark, and they keep their pelvic fins in contact with the eggs to remain at the right distance for fanning. In darkness the pair recognizes each other and detect predators using their sense of smell.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common {{indication}} for tracheal intubation is for the placement of a conduit through which nitrous oxide or volatile anesthetics may be administered. General anesthetic agents, opioids, and neuromuscular-blocking drugs may diminish or even abolish the respiratory drive. Although {{it is not the}} only means to maintain a patent airway during general anesthesia, intubation of the trachea provides the most reliable means of <b>oxygenation</b> and ventilation and the greatest degree of protection against regurgitation and pulmonary aspiration.|$|E
5|$|Several {{million years}} ago, {{a species of}} small African ape gained the ability to stand upright. The {{subsequent}} advent of human life, {{and the development of}} agriculture and further civilization allowed humans to affect the Earth more rapidly than any previous life form, affecting both the nature and quantity of other organisms as well as global climate. By comparison, the Great <b>Oxygenation</b> Event, produced by the proliferation of algae during the Siderian period, required about 300million years to culminate.|$|E
5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} wood shavings until one of the excavators found two stuck together and peeled them apart to discover writing on the inside. They {{were taken to the}} epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid <b>oxygenation</b> of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable {{by the time he was}} able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable. However, Alan Bowman at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of cursive script and were able to produce transcriptions.|$|E
5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the third part, ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for <b>oxygenation.</b>|$|E
5|$|Former {{changes in}} sea levels have left {{continental}} shelves, shallow {{areas in the}} sea close to land. These nutrient-rich waters teem with life, which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals, and seaweed—which are both harvested in the wild and farmed. The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs. Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting. Oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters: even under enormous depths and pressures, nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem. Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the <b>oxygenation</b> of Earth's atmosphere; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea.|$|E
5|$|Inability {{to secure}} the airway, with {{subsequent}} failure of <b>oxygenation</b> and ventilation is a life-threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased oxygen content, brain damage, cardiovascular collapse, and death. When performed improperly, the associated complications (e.g., unrecognized esophageal intubation) may be rapidly fatal. Without adequate training and experience, the incidence of such complications is high. The case of Andrew Davis Hughes, from Emerald Isle, NC is a widely known {{case in which the}} patient was improperly intubated and, {{due to the lack of}} oxygen, suffered severe brain damage and died. For example, among paramedics in several United States urban communities, unrecognized esophageal or hypopharyngeal intubation has been reported to be 6% to 25%. Although not common, where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate, reported success rates are as low as 51%. In one study, nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in the emergency room. Because of this, recent editions of the American Heart Association's Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation have de-emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, the laryngeal mask airway and the Combitube.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, <b>oxygenation</b> will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors <b>oxygenation</b> will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{profound}} geobiological event is the introduction of oxygen into the atmosphere by photosynthetic bacteria. This <b>oxygenation</b> of Earth's primoidial atmosphere (the so-called oxygen catastrophe or Great <b>Oxygenation</b> Event) and the <b>oxygenation</b> of the oceans altered surface biogeochemical cycles {{and the types of}} organisms that have been evolutionarily selected for.|$|E
25|$|Pressure support {{improves}} <b>oxygenation,</b> ventilation {{and decreases}} work of breathing.|$|E

25|$|Administration {{of oxygen}} at 15 litres per minute by face mask or bag valve mask is often sufficient, but {{tracheal}} intubation with mechanical ventilation may be necessary. Suctioning of pulmonary oedema fluid should be balanced against {{the need for}} <b>oxygenation.</b> The target of ventilation is to achieve 92% to 96% arterial saturation and adequate chest rise. Positive end-expiratory pressure will generally improve <b>oxygenation.</b> Drug administration via peripheral veins is preferred over endotracheal administration. Hypotension remaining after <b>oxygenation</b> may be treated by rapid crystalloid infusion. Cardiac arrest in drowning usually presents as asystole or pulseless electrical activity. Ventricular fibrillation {{is more likely to}} be associated with complications of pre-existing coronary artery disease, severe hypothermia, or the use of epinephrine or norepinephrine.|$|E
25|$|Biosequestration may be {{enhanced}} by improving photosynthetic efficiency by modifying RuBisCO genes in plants to increase the catalytic and/or <b>oxygenation</b> activity of that enzyme.|$|E
25|$|The Undersea Medical Society (now Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society) {{formed a}} Committee on Hyperbaric <b>Oxygenation</b> {{which has become}} {{recognized}} as the authority on indications for hyperbaric oxygen treatment.|$|E
25|$|Medical care {{includes}} supportive treatment, in case any of {{the following}} complications happen, medical team should be ready. Possible complications include heart failure, hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, and <b>oxygenation</b> deficit.|$|E
25|$|NASA {{scientists}} Hartman and McKay {{argue that}} plate tectonics {{may in fact}} slow the rise of <b>oxygenation</b> (and thus stymie complex life rather than promote it). Computer modelling by Tilman Spohn in 2014 found that plate tectonics on Earth may have arisen {{from the effects of}} complex life's emergence, {{rather than the other way}} around as the Rare Earth might suggest. The action of lichens on rock may have contributed to the formation of subduction zones in the presence of water. Kasting argues that if <b>oxygenation</b> caused the Cambrian explosion then any planet with oxygen producing photosynthesis should have complex life.|$|E
25|$|Various methods {{exist to}} {{ameliorate}} these problems, including antibiotic and antibacterial use, debridement, irrigation, vacuum-assisted closure, warming, <b>oxygenation,</b> moist wound healing (the term pioneered by George D. Winter), removing mechanical stress, and adding cells or other materials to secrete or enhance levels of healing factors.|$|E
25|$|Intensive care {{is often}} used in the {{developed}} world. This may include maintaining blood volume and electrolytes (salts) balance as well as treating any bacterial infections that may develop. Dialysis may be needed for kidney failure, and extracorporeal membrane <b>oxygenation</b> {{may be used for}} lung dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|The hypercapnic {{state is}} {{routinely}} used to calibrate blood-oxygen-level dependent functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (BOLD fMRI), a modality that is sensitive to changes in blood <b>oxygenation.</b> However, this calibration crucially relies on the assumption that hypercapnia has no effect on neuronal function, which is a matter of debate.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} when using fMRI or PET to study emotional responses. Because fMRI measures changes in blood <b>oxygenation,</b> using the BOLD effect, its temporal resolution {{is limited by}} the haemodynamic response to several seconds. PET has similar limits, offering slightly better temporal resolution and slightly worse spatial resolution.|$|E
25|$|Timing of {{withdrawal}} from mechanical ventilation—also known as weaning—should be carefully considered. Patients should have their ventilation considered for withdrawal {{if they are}} able to support their own ventilation and <b>oxygenation,</b> and this should be assessed continuously. There are several objective parameters to look for when considering withdrawal, but there are no specific criteria that generalizes to all patients.|$|E
25|$|Pre-hospital {{care for}} lung {{barotrauma}} includes basic life support of maintaining adequate <b>oxygenation</b> and perfusion, assessment of airway, breathing and circulation, neurological assessment, and managing any immediate life-threatening conditions. High-flow oxygen up to 100% is considered appropriate for diving accidents. Large-bore venous access with isotonic fluid infusion is recommended to maintain {{blood pressure and}} pulse.|$|E
25|$|Three to four {{billion years}} ago, the Sun emitted only 70% as much power {{as it does}} today. If the {{atmospheric}} composition had been the same as today, liquid water should not have existed on Earth. However, there is evidence {{for the presence of}} water on the early Earth, in the Hadean and Archean eons, leading to {{what is known as the}} faint young Sun paradox. Hypothesized solutions to this paradox include a vastly different atmosphere, with much higher concentrations of greenhouse gases than currently exist. Over the following approximately 4 billion years, the energy output of the Sun increased and atmospheric composition changed. The Great <b>Oxygenation</b> Eventnbsp&– <b>oxygenation</b> of the atmosphere around 2.4 billion years agonbsp&– was the most notable alteration. Over the next five billion years, the Sun's ultimate death as it becomes a red giant and then a white dwarf will have large effects on climate, with the red giant phase possibly ending any life on Earth that survives until that time.|$|E
25|$|Photoacoustic imaging is a {{recently}} developed hybrid biomedical imaging modality {{based on the}} photoacoustic effect. It combines the advantages of optical absorption contrast with ultrasonic spatial resolution for deep imaging in (optical) diffusive or quasi-diffusive regime. Recent {{studies have shown that}} photoacoustic imaging can be used in vivo for tumor angiogenesis monitoring, blood <b>oxygenation</b> mapping, functional brain imaging, and skin melanoma detection, etc.|$|E
25|$|Brandon (formerly Holden) Neonatal Intensive Care Unit: 46-bed facility, one of {{the largest}} {{neonatal}} ICU's in the country. **Extracorporeal Membrane <b>Oxygenation</b> (ECMO): Technology developed at U-M; provides temporary heart and lung assistance in the intensive care setting. Approximately 90-130 patients undergo ECMO treatment at UMHS per year, many of them flown to the Health System from across the country by the UMHS Survival Flight program.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{supported}} by methods that certainly maintain enough blood circulation and <b>oxygenation</b> for sustaining life during stopped heartbeat and breathing, such as cardiopulmonary bypass, are not customarily considered clinically dead. All {{parts of the}} body except the heart and lungs continue to function normally. Clinical death occurs only if machines providing sole circulatory support are turned off, leaving the patient in a state of stopped blood circulation.|$|E
25|$|Except in {{the most}} severe cases, ischemic colitis is treated with {{supportive}} care. IV fluids are given to treat dehydration, and the patient is placed on bowel rest (meaning nothing to eat or drink) until the symptoms resolve. If possible, cardiac function and <b>oxygenation</b> should be optimized to improve oxygen delivery to the ischemic bowel. A nasogastric tube may be inserted if an ileus is present.|$|E
25|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} {{refers to}} the insertion of a catheter down the trachea. This procedure is commonly performed during surgery, {{in order to ensure}} a person receives enough oxygen when sedated. The catheter is connected to a machine that monitors the airflow, <b>oxygenation</b> and several other metrics. This is often one of the responsibilities of an anesthetist during surgery. The epiglottic vallecula is an important anatomical landmark for carrying out this procedure.|$|E
25|$|The oxygen-carrying protein {{hemoglobin}} {{was discovered}} by Hünefeld in 1840. In 1851, German physiologist Otto Funke published {{a series of articles}} in which he described growing hemoglobin crystals by successively diluting red blood cells with a solvent such as pure water, alcohol or ether, followed by slow evaporation of the solvent from the resulting protein solution. Hemoglobin's reversible <b>oxygenation</b> was described a few years later by Felix Hoppe-Seyler.|$|E
25|$|Aspirated {{water that}} reaches the alveoli destroys the surfactant, which causes {{pulmonary}} oedema and decreased lung compliance which compromises <b>oxygenation</b> in affected {{parts of the}} lungs. This is associated with metabolic acidosis, and secondary fluid and electrolyte shifts. During alveolar fluid exchange, diatoms present in the water may pass through the alveolar wall into the capillaries to be carried to internal organs. Presence of these diatoms may be diagnostic of drowning.|$|E
25|$|Narrower stomatal {{apertures}} {{can be used}} {{in conjunction}} with an intermediary molecule with a high carbon dioxide affinity, PEPcase (Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase). Retrieving the products of carbon fixation from PEPCase is an energy-intensive process, however. As a result, the PEPCase alternative is preferable only where water is limiting but light is plentiful, or where high temperatures increase the solubility of oxygen relative to that of carbon dioxide, magnifying RuBisCo's <b>oxygenation</b> problem.|$|E
