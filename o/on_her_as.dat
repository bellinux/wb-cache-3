The ship was constructed for eventual {{replacement of the}} aging Queen Elizabeth 2, the Cunard flagship from 1969 to 2004 and the last major ocean liner built before the construction of Queen Mary 2. Queen Mary 2 had the Royal Mail Ship (RMS) title conferred <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> <b>as</b> a gesture to Cunard's history, by Royal Mail when she entered service in 2004 on the Southampton to New York route.|$|E

The Chinese losses were far greater, at 521 killed, 150 wounded {{and a large number}} missing after the battle. The bombardment of the arsenal lasted for two days before the French ships headed back down the river, destroying any forts they encountered on the way.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Katy and her boyfriend (played by actor and model Brian Nagel) have crashed their plane {{in the middle of the}} jungle. Katy shows signs of worry, while her boyfriend takes pictures of himself and dumps his bags on her to explore. As it turns to night, they wander through the jungle as he throws things back at her. Suddenly, he is attacked by a tiger and Katy dumps her bags and runs off screaming. She approaches a lake and is almost bitten by a crocodile when she tries to take a drink. She sits on a rock and ends up with a tarantula crawling <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> <b>As</b> she looks into the lake while singing the chorus, she sees a reflection of a tiger instead of herself. Behind her in the darkness there are dozens of pairs of blinking eyes, but they are revealed to be fireflies which fly around her before forming an image of a roaring tiger in the sky.|$|E
5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned somewhat different. Seeing the girl was not mad as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela to keep an eye <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> <b>As</b> the days passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a sliver of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what she was, and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.|$|E

25|$|Lieutenant de vaisseau Le Tourneur carried dispatches from Brest to Newfoundland and St Pierre (probably Saint Pierre and Miquelon) on {{a voyage}} that lasted from 12 June 1790 until 3 November.

25|$|In January, 1935 Weston {{was facing}} {{increasing}} financial difficulties. He closed his studio in Carmel {{and moved to}} Santa Monica Canyon, California, where he opened a new studio with Brett. He implored Wilson to come and live with him, and in August 1935 she finally agreed. While she had an intense interest in his work, Wilson {{was the first woman}} Weston had lived with since Flora who had no interest in becoming a photographer. This allowed Weston to concentrate <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> his muse and model, and in turn Wilson devoted her time to promoting Weston's art as his assistant and quasi-agent.|$|E
25|$|Katy Gallagher {{has also}} faced {{suggestions}} from the Daily Telegraph {{that she may}} be an Ecuadorian citizen, due to the 2008 Ecuadorian constitution which established the right of citizenship for anyone born in Ecuador, {{as well as their}} descendants even if born abroad. Gallagher has stated that the change in law in 2008 had no effect <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> <b>as</b> the change does not apply retrospectively to the time of her mother's birth. The ALP has also obtained advice from an Ecuadorian legal expert and an Australian constitutional lawyer which it states confirmed that Gallagher is not an Ecuadorian citizen.|$|E
25|$|Bogart {{could be}} generous with actors, {{particularly}} those who were blacklisted, down on their luck, or having personal problems. During the filming of the Edward Dmytryk directed The Left Hand of God (1955), he noticed his co-star Gene Tierney {{having a hard time}} remembering her lines and behaving oddly. He coached Tierney, feeding her lines. He was familiar with mental illness from his sister's bouts of depression, and encouraged Tierney to seek treatment. He also stood behind Joan Bennett and insisted <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> his co-star in Michael Curtiz's We're No Angels when an ugly public scandal made her persona non grata with Jack Warner.|$|E

25|$|Departing 12 May, Georgiana cruised off the Galapagos {{in search}} of British whaling ships. While sailing near James Island 28 May, she met Catherine and Rose and {{captured}} them with no resistance. She then chased a third whaler, Hector and engaged in a brief, but sharp, combat which brought down Hectors main-topmast and most of her standing and running rigging. After capturing Hector, Georgiana placed the crews of all three whalers in Rose, under parole, and sent her as a cartel to St Helena. Georgiana, Catherine, and Hector then on 24 June joined Essex at Tumbez, Peru. Also on 28 May, Essex captured the whaler Greenwich; Porter armed her too as and put Lieutenant Gamble of the US Marines <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> captain.|$|E
25|$|In {{relation}} to this interpretation, William Empson suggests that Katherina was originally performed {{by an adult}} male actor rather than a young boy. He argues that the play indicates on several occasions that Katherina is physically strong, and even capable of over-powering Petruchio. For example, this is demonstrated off-stage when the horse falls <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> she is riding to Petruchio's home, and {{she is able to}} lift it off herself, and later when she throws Petruchio off a servant he is beating. Empson argues that the point is not that Katherina is, as a woman, weak, but that she is not well cast in the role in life which she finds herself having to play. The end of the play then offers blatant irony when a strong male actor, dressed as a woman, lectures women on how to play their parts.|$|E
25|$|One of Raj's biggest {{personality}} quirks is his {{tendency to}} speak or act inappropriately, often landing him in trouble or {{leading to an}} angry reaction from whomever he has upset. This was particularly pronounced when he was {{under the influence of}} alcohol, which could cause a catch-22, since for years he needed alcohol to even speak to a woman, but the alcohol led to him say the wrong things. On one occasion, just as Leonard and Penny are about to have sex in their hotel room, Raj enters and obliviously proceeds to climb into Sheldon's recently vacated bed, completely unaware of what he has interrupted. On another occasion, he openly discussed having had crushes on Penny and Bernadette directly in front of them, which caused both discomfort, and unwittingly hurting Amy's feelings when he admits that he never had a crush <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> well (despite Penny and Bernadette's best efforts to alert him to this fact).|$|E

25|$|Problematic and strong-willed, {{she falls}} for the Butchers' lodger Paul Priestly (Mark Thrippleton) in 1989, much to Frank's annoyance. Diane takes the {{relationship}} {{more seriously than}} Paul, and she is devastated when he finishes with her to begin a fling with hairdreser Julie Cooper (Louise Plowright). Paul and Julie do not last, and he immediately returns to Diane. Scorned, Diane cannot forgive Julie for taking Paul, and she plays various vengeful tricks <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> payback, such as sabotaging her salon's opening day and sending her a male escort to make her look desperate. Julie responds by flirting with Paul to infuriate Diane further, and their feud culminates in a showdown in The Queen Vic one night, at which Julie humiliates Diane. Paul quickly loses interest in Diane. Ignoring his reticence, Diane convinces herself that Paul is contemplating proposing marriage to her, so she is broken-hearted when he returns to his hometown in Leeds in December 1989; he leaves without saying goodbye.|$|E
25|$|Cosimo {{was searching}} for a wife who could help {{strengthen}} his political position and had initially asked to marry Margaret of Austria, the widow of Duke Alessandro de’ Medici, who displayed enormous reluctance at the idea (thus serving her father’s own interest and plans for her). The Emperor, not wanting to antagonize Cosimo, offered {{him one of the}} daughters of the rich viceroy of Naples. The viceroy agreed, provided Cosimo settled a large amount of money <b>on</b> <b>her</b> <b>as</b> dowry. This marriage was politically beneficial as the Medici were new to their ducal status. Additionally, Eleanor's royal Castilian ancestors and relations with the Habsburgs provided the Medici with the blue blood they had hitherto lacked and began the process of placing them on a footing with other European sovereigns. Through her father, Eleanor also provided the Medici with a powerful link to Spain, at that time ultimately in control of Florence, so that the marriage offered Cosimo I the opportunity to show sufficient loyalty to and trust in Spain that Spanish troops could be withdrawn from the province.|$|E
25|$|When King Henry VIII died, {{the castle}} became the {{property}} of his son, King Edward VI of England, who gave it to his uncle, Thomas Seymour, whom he made Baron of Sudeley. In early Spring 1547, Lord Seymour married King Edward's stepmother, the Dowager Queen Catherine Parr. At the announcement of her pregnancy in late 1547, Seymour began to renovate the castle for Catherine's use, but only one room that he built remains today. Lord Seymour and Catherine decided that she should move to Sudeley for the final months of her pregnancy. At about six months, Catherine was accompanied by Lady Jane Grey and a large retinue of ladies to attend <b>on</b> <b>her,</b> <b>as</b> well as over one hundred gentlemen of the household and Yeomen of the guard. Catherine's sister Anne, Countess of Pembroke, also came and attended upon her as her chief lady and groom of the stool. Catherine {{gave birth to her}} daughter, Lady Mary Seymour, on 30 August 1548, only to die on 5 September of that year. She was buried in the Chapel. Her grave was later discovered in 1782, after the castle and the chapel had been left in ruins by the English Civil War. She was later reinterred by the Rector of Sudeley in 1817, and an elaborate tomb was erected in her honour.|$|E
