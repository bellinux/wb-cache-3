40|$|Ships {{traversing}} the Gulf of Tehauantepec {{on their}} way to and from the Panama Canal have often encountered strong winds and heavy seas during the winter months. These winds called “Tehauantepecers ” are the result of both the synoptic situation and the topography.

40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} distributions <b>of</b> marine cold <b>air</b> <b>outbreaks</b> (MCAOs) over the northern North Atlantic have been investigated using re-analysis data for the period from 1958 to 2007. MCAOs are large-scale <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>air</b> over a relatively warm ocean surface. Such conditions are known {{to increase the severity}} of particular types of hazardous mesoscale weather phenomena. We used a simple index for identifying MCAOs: the vertical potential temperature gradient between the sea surface and 700 hPa. It was found that atmospheric temperature variability is considerably more important than the sea surface temperature variability in governing both the seasonal and the inter-annual variability of MCAOs. Furthermore, a composite analysis revealed that a few well-defined and robust synoptic patterns are evident during MCAOs in winter. Over the Labrador and Irminger Seas the MCAO index was found to have a correlation of 0. 70 with the North Atlantic Oscillation index, while over the Barents Sea a negative correlation of 0. 42 was found...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe LAPBIAT {{measurement}} campaign {{took place}} in the SMEAR I measurement station located in Eastern Lapland in the spring of 2003 between 26 April and 11 May. In this paper we describe the measurement campaign, concentrations and fluxes <b>of</b> aerosol particles, <b>air</b> ions and trace gases, paying special attention to an aerosol particle formation event broken by a polluted air mass approaching from industrial areas of Kola Peninsula, Russia. Aerosol particle number flux measurements show strong downward fluxes during that time. Concentrations of coarse aerosol particles were high for 1 ? 2 days before the nucleation event (i. e. 28 ? 29 April), very low immediately before and during the observed aerosol particle formation event (30 April) and increased moderately from the moment of sudden break of the event. In general particle deposition measurements based on snow samples show the same changes. Measurements of the mobility distribution <b>of</b> <b>air</b> ions showed elevated concentrations <b>of</b> intermediate <b>air</b> ions during the particle formation event. We estimated the growth rates in the nucleation mode size range. For particles < 10 nm, the growth rate increases with size on 30 April. Dispersion modelling made with model SILAM support the conclusion that the nucleation event was interrupted by an <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> sulphate-rich <b>air</b> mass in the evening of 30 April that originated from the industry at Kola Peninsula, Russia.

40|$|An {{exceptionally}} cold episode {{occurred in}} January 2017 over the Balkan Peninsula. Analysis of historical records {{showed that it}} was one of the coldest extreme episodes. Even though the low temperatures of January 2017 did not break previous low records for all stations, the long duration was quite extreme, resulting in strong socioeconomic impacts in the region of interest. The 10 -year to 100 -year return values of minimum temperatures were calculated based on block maxima method and the maximum likelihood estimates. The estimated return periods of the absolute minimum temperature are approximately 15 or 20 years for almost all stations. For only one station, the absolute minimum temperature of January 2017 might happen once in every 300 years according to the return level results. Moreover, the extreme cold episode over the Balkans during the period of 5 January 2017 to 12 January 2017 was associated with a significant <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> arctic <b>air</b> masses into eastern–central Europe and the Balkans and a cutoff low at the level of 500 hPa over the region...|$|R

Within five days, this cold air mass extended from the southern Philippine Islands to the northern Marianas. The cold air quickly diminished, which spawned convection and multiple surface circulations across the monsoon trough. Thunderstorm activity consolidated on December 21, and an increased in organization prompted the issuance of a TCFA the next day. Later on December 22, both the JTWC and JMA upgraded the disturbance into a tropical depression. On December 24, the JMA upgraded the depression into Tropical Storm Val. Around the time, JTWC and JMA reported that Lee attained its peak intensity of 65 mph and 50 mph. Also on December 24, Val, which was moving westward at around 25 mph, grounded to a halt.

They are described here in terms <b>of</b> their <b>air</b> temperatures, air mass central pressures, and wind characteristics, as well as in relation to the atmospheric circulation and their trajectories over the continents. <b>Outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> polar <b>air</b> fito low latitudes tend to organize tropical convection and rain in summer, while the cold air tends to produce cooling in lower latitudes and freezes in the subtropics during winter. Cold waves accompanying polar outbreaks havê other significant impacts in the Americas,including adverse effects on coffee production in SouthAmerica and on citrus production in North America. Synoptic events leading to cold waves are somewhat similar in the Americas, particularly in terms <b>of</b> the upper <b>air</b> patterns and forcing, but the intensity <b>of</b> the <b>outbreaks</b> in terms <b>of</b> temperature and pressure is larger in North America. Typically, they are associated with an amplified ridge lying across the westem edge of the conti- nent. Records of freezes in coffee - and citrus-growing areas are used to reconstruct subtropical climate Variability and to identify linkages to low-frequency variability mechanisms in the atmospheric circulation. Results suggest that there is little link between the occurrence of EI Nino and cold waves and freezes in either hemisphere. Citrus freeze occurrences in Florida are linked to the long-term variability in the Pacific- North American (PNA) teleconnection pattem, and they arrear to occur in clusters concentrated near the end of each century.

The Saharan dusts have been characterised and distinguished from non-Saharan in both Coulter and Galai analyses in aerosols and rains. The results were interpreted with special mention to Saharan dusts.

40|$|Abstract. A {{survey of}} {{mesoscale}} cyclogenesis near the Antarctic peninsula {{has been carried}} out for 1991 based on digital satellite imagery collected at Palmer Station. Slightly higher cyclonic activity was found over the Bellingshausen Sea sector (BSS) than in the Weddell Sea sector (WSS). Both sides were characterized by a pronounced formation maximum in summer and a minimum in winter. Comma clouds were the dominant vortex type, and their average diameter was around 370 km. Trajectories show that many vortices in the BSS move northeastward toward the Drake Passage, {{with some of the most}} well developed moving north-northeastward to the southern tip of South America, bringing severe weather conditions to that area; little systematic motion was noted over the WSS. The fraction of mesoscale cyclones with middle and/or high cloud on the west side of the Antarctic peninsula was much higher than on the east side. These numerous and deep mesoscale cyclones are a consequence <b>of</b> the frequent <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>air</b> associated with synoptic-scale cyclones that move cold air northward over the relatively warm Bellingshausen Sea, with convective instability resulting. This happens much less often in the WSS, where low-level baroclinic instability and vortex stretching are the dominant formation mechanisms and air-sea interaction is usually much less vigorous due to the stabilizing influence of the extended sea-ice cover. 1...|$|R
