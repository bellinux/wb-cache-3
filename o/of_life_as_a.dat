5|$|Sindhu {{was given}} the ever-full bowl of amrita (elixir <b>of</b> <b>life)</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> boon from the Sun-god. The demon was warned that he could drink from the bowl {{as long as it}} was intact. So to protect the bowl, he {{swallowed}} it. Sindhu terrorized the three worlds, so the gods asked Gunesha for help. Gunesha defeated Sindhu's army, cut his general Kamalasura into three pieces and then cut open Sindhu's body, emptying the amrita bowl and thus killing the demon. The creator-god Brahma is described as having built the Morgaon shrine, and marrying Siddhi and Buddhi to Ganesha. At the end of this incarnation, Gunesha returned to his celestial abode, giving his peacock mount to his younger brother Skanda, with whom the peacock mount is generally associated.|$|E

For example, current efforts at change or reform include urging the VA to place more emphasis on vocational rehabilitation and treatment versus cash payments; revising the General Rating Formula for Mental Disorders to better reflect problems experienced by veterans with PTSD; establishing a balance between efforts to decrease claims processing time (productivity) {{with the need for}} consistency and accuracy of examination results and rating decisions (quality); and considering a veteran's quality <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> factor in determining the disability rating.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in October 2004, Life was revived for {{a second}} time.

25|$|Claude McKay was a {{poet who}} flourished during the Harlem Renaissance, a major {{literary}} {{movement in the}} 1920s. During this time, McKay’s poems challenged white authority while celebrating Jamaican culture. He also wrote tales about the trials and tribulations <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> black man in both Jamaica and America. McKay was not secretive about his hatred for racism and felt that racist people were stupid and could not look past their shortsightedness and hatred. In tales like Home to Harlem', McKay depicts a culture in Harlem that is full of drug use, prostitution, {{and a variety of}} sexual encounters. His depiction was criticized as a negative portrayal of Harlem and its lower-class citizens by prominent figures such as W.E.B. DuBois, but was later applauded as a literary force in the Harlem Renaissance. McKay’s poetry brought awareness to the racist treatment that many black individuals faced.|$|E

25|$|Actions and {{emotions}} {{in the current}} lifetime affect future incarnations depending {{on the nature of}} the particular karma. For example, a good and virtuous life indicates a latent desire to experience good and virtuous themes of life. Therefore, such a person attracts karma that ensures that his future births will allow him to experience and manifest his virtues and good feelings unhindered. In this case, he may take birth in heaven or in a prosperous and virtuous human family. On the other hand, a person who has indulged in immoral deeds, or with a cruel disposition, indicates a latent desire to experience cruel themes <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> natural consequence, he will attract karma which will ensure that he is reincarnated in hell, or in lower life forms, to enable his soul to experience the cruel themes of life.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{injunction}} to be modest, various forms of dress were developed {{in different parts of the}} Islamic world, but some forms of dress were carryovers from earlier, pre-Islamic Near Eastern societies: the practice of women covering their hair was the norm in the earlier communities of Jews and Christians. The iconography of the Virgin Mary in Christian art always shows her with her hair covered, and this convention was followed into the modern era by both Georgian and Armenian Christians, in addition to Oriental Jewish women; Catholic women would not go to church without covering their heads until well into the twentieth century. The covering of the hair was taken by women to be a natural part <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sign of modesty and especially as a sign of respect before God.|$|E
25|$|Luxembourg is at or {{near the}} top of world rankings for GDP per capita and for quality <b>of</b> <b>life.</b> <b>As</b> <b>a</b> result, living {{standards}} are high throughout the country, especially in residential areas around Luxembourg City, including Mamer itself. Private houses, many fully detached, usually have sizeable gardens, garages and cellars. There are also a few apartment buildings and houses for rent. Costs of accommodation are high as a result of increasing demand but are offset by low municipal taxes and Luxembourg's low sales tax, particularly on fuel. Cable television is provided throughout the commune and includes stations broadcasting in languages other than the local French, German and Luxembourgish. A very wide range of TV programmes can be accessed via satellite including English-language BBC and SKY channel. Broadband or cable-based internet access is widely available.

25|$|Many criticisms {{focus on}} {{versions}} of the strong anthropic principle, such as Barrow and Tipler's anthropic cosmological principle, which are teleological notions that tend to describe the existence <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> necessary prerequisite for the observable constants of physics. Similarly, Stephen Jay Gould, Michael Shermer, and others claim that the stronger {{versions of the}} anthropic principle seem to reverse known causes and effects. Gould compared {{the claim that the}} universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hotdog buns, or saying that ships had been invented to house barnacles. These critics cite the vast physical, fossil, genetic, and other biological evidence consistent with life having been fine-tuned through natural selection to adapt to the physical and geophysical environment in which life exists. Life appears to have adapted to the universe, and not vice versa.|$|E
25|$|Hari Raya Saraswati is {{dedicated}} {{the goddess of}} learning, science, and literature. She rules the intellectual and creative realm, and is the patron goddess of libraries and schools. Balinese Hindus believe that knowledge is an essential medium to achieve the goal <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> human being, and so honor her. She is also celebrated because she succeeded in taming the wandering and lustful mind of her consort, Brahma, who was preoccupied with the goddess of material existence, Shatarupa. On this day, offerings are made to the lontar (palm-leaf manuscripts), books, and shrines. Saraswati Day is celebrated every 210-days on Saniscara Umanis Wuku Watugunung and marks {{the start of the}} new year according to the Balinese Pawukon calendar. Ceremonies and prayers are held at the temples in family compounds, educational institutions and temples, villages, and businesses from morning to noon. Teachers and students replace their uniforms for the day with bright and colourful ceremonial clothing, filling the island with color. Children bring fruit and traditional cakes to school for offerings at the temple.|$|E
25|$|Fulgentius’s work {{demonstrates}} a clear {{continuation of the}} antique Roman compendium tradition. This concise encyclopaedic style of compiling information was common for Roman writers like Cato the Elder and Cicero. His work {{is also consistent with}} the Stoic and Neoplatonic traditions which interpreted myth as a representation of deeper spiritual processes. His allegorical approach to mythography may have originated in the no-longer-extant Virgil commentary of Aelius Donatus, and it was certainly evident in the later moralising Virgil commentaries of Servius. Fulgentius’s treatment of Virgil as a sage seems to have been borrowed from the encyclopaedic work of Macrobius, the first to elevate the Roman poet to such an authoritative status. However, Fulgentiuss’ tendency to strip classical myth of all its manifest detail and replace it with ethical interpretations appears to {{have more in common with}} the late 5th-century writer Martianus Capella. Capella’s work brought the theme <b>of</b> <b>life</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> spiritual journey to the forefront of Classical literature, a trend which Fulgentius seemed to carry a step further.|$|E
