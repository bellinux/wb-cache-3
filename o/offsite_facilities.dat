[...] The program's growth can be attributed in part to three laws that Congress passed over the last decade. Growth in the number of covered entity sites also stems from a recent federal policy change.

40|$|The Chemical Waste Landfill (CWL) at Sandia National Laboratories/New Mexico (SNL/NM) is a 1. 9 -acre {{disposal}} site {{that was used}} for the disposal of chemical wastes generated by many of SNL/NM research laboratories from 1962 until 1985. These laboratories were primarily involved in the design, research and development of non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons and the waste generated by these labs included small quantities of a wide assortment of chemical products. A Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Closure Plan for the Chemical Waste Landfill was approved by the New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) in 1992. Subsequent site characterization activities identified the presence of significant amounts of chromium in the soil as far as 80 feet below ground surface (fbgs) and the delineation of a solvent plume in the vadose zone that extends to groundwater approximately 500 fbgs. Trichloroethylene (TCE) was detected in some groundwater samples at concentrations slightly above the drinking water limit of 5 parts per billion. In 1997 an active vapor extraction system reduced the size of the TCE vapor plume and for the last six quarterly sampling events groundwater samples have not detected TCE above the drinking water standard. A source term removal, being conducted as a Voluntary Corrective Measure (VCM), began in September 1998 and is expected to take up to two years. Four distinct disposal areas were identified from historical data and the contents of disposal pits and trenches in these areas, in addition to much of the highly contaminated soil surrounding the disposal cells, are currently being excavated. Buried waste and debris are expected to extend to a depth of 12 to 15 fbgs. Excavation will focus on the removal of buried debris and contaminated soil in a sequential, area by area manner and will proceed to whatever depth is required in order to remove all pit contents. Up to 50, 000 cubic yards of soil and debris will be removed and managed during the excavation of the CWL. As part of the excavation process, soil is being separated from the buried debris using a 2 -inch mechanical screen. After separation from the soil, debris items are further-segregated by matrix into the following categories: wood, scrap metal, concrete/aggregates, resins, compatible debris, intact chemical containers, radioactive and mixed waste, and high hazard items. One of the greatest sources of hazards throughout the excavation process is the removal of numerous intact chemical containers with unknown contents. A large portion of the excavated soil is contaminated with metals and/or solvents, Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are also known to be present. Most of the contaminated soils being excavated will be taken to the nearby Corrective Action Management Unit (CAMU) for treatment and management while a majority of the containers will be taken to the Hazardous Waste Management Facility or the Radioactive and Mixed Waste Management Facility for proper treatment and/or disposal at permitted <b>offsite</b> <b>facilities...</b>|$|E

We chose this method over depopulation or test-and removal procedures because the infection was highly {{prevalent in the}} breeding herd (63 %), the breeding herd was very valuable (a seedstock operation), and because another farm was concurrently available. Modified medicated early weaning (at 14 days) was also {{used to try to}} eradicate other chronic respiratory diseases detected in the herd. Samples taken from pigs raised on-site were positive by indirect-ffuorescent antibody (IFA) assay. Animals tested at the <b>offsite</b> <b>facility</b> (90 head) were negative by IFA for 4 months, but then infection occurred. PRRSvirus was isolated from one pig in the nursery and allpigs tested were seropositiveto PRRSvirus. The source of the viruswas thought to be a carrier pig. No evidence of pneumonia was detected at slaughter, and this observation in conjunction with a lack of clinical signs indicated that in this high health herd, PRRSinfection was subclinical. Five to 6 months after infection, IFA titers in 5 - to 6 -month-old pigs decreased from 1024 to undetectable (0 - 16) over 5 months. Nursery pigs were seronegative at weaning and seroconverted to PRRSvirus at 8 - 10 weeks of age.

The results of that survey, published in 2000, suggested that 3 % of drilling wastes, less than 0. 5 % of produced water, and 15 % of associated wastes are sent to <b>offsite</b> commercial <b>facilities</b> for disposal. Argonne National Laboratory (Argonne) collected information on commercial E&P waste disposal companies in different states in 1997. While the information is nearly a decade old, the report has proved useful. In 2005, Argonne began collecting current information to update and expand the data. This report describes the new 2005 - 2006 database and focuses on the availability of offsite commercial disposal companies, the prevailing disposal methods, and estimated disposal costs. The data were collected in two phases. In the first phase, state oil and gas regulatory officials in 31 states were contacted to determine whether their agency maintained a list of permitted commercial disposal companies dedicated to oil. In the second stage, individual commercial disposal companies were interviewed to determine disposal methods and costs. The availability of offsite commercial disposal companies and facilities falls into three categories. The states with high oil and gas production typically have a dedicated network of offsite commercial disposal companies and facilities in place. In other states, such an infrastructure does not exist and very often, commercial disposal companies focus on produced water services. About half of the states do not have any industry-specific offsite commercial disposal infrastructure. In those states, operators take their wastes to local municipal landfills if permitted or haul the wastes to other states.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Producing {{buildings}} in a factory, Offsite Production (OSP), dramatically improves overall {{health and safety}} performance, {{but there is no}} room for complacency. This paper presents the results of a questionnaire and interview survey using multiple sources of data linked with peer debriefing from eight major <b>offsite</b> production <b>facilities.</b> In particular, health and safety benefits along with the trend toward a production manufacturing environment are identified. The research found that attitudes toward production oriented health and safety in OSP are still in the embryonic stage, but are developing rapidly with increased awareness from management. To realise the positive outcomes from the health and safety benefits that OSP entails, OSP manufacturers must adopt a mindset akin to that already existing in the mainstream manufacturing sector. Many OSP manufacturers adopt site based techniques “under cover” of a factory. The health and safety benefits of OSP may be well understood and promoted in several arenas, academia, government initiatives and the health regulatory bodies, but unless the manufacturers themselves embrace the full health and safety potential of OSP, misunderstanding and ignorance will remain a barrier to improved health and safety performance.
