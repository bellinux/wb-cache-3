40|$|This {{dissertation}} improves {{our understanding}} of Asian consumers by providing {{a new perspective on}} the role <b>of</b> <b>face</b> in consumer decision-making. This dissertation develops a theory <b>of</b> <b>face</b> pressure which argues that consumers consider the effects of their decisions on their face (e. g. saving face) during the decision-making process and this exerts a pressure on conspicuous consumption intentions. This research contributes to the literature by fundamentally re-conceptualizing the role <b>of</b> <b>face</b> in the decision-making process to be a direct motivator of specific behavior. This conceptualization also incorporates important aspects <b>of</b> <b>face</b> that are critical to understanding its role in decision-making. The theory <b>of</b> <b>face</b> pressure considers face a direct motivator of behavior and, due to this novel perspective, identifies a pair <b>of</b> <b>face</b> pressure motivations-a motivation to gain face and a motivation to avoid the loss <b>of</b> <b>face.</b> It also captures the interdependence <b>of</b> <b>face</b> which theorizes that an individual’s behavior impacts the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> others. Finally, the theory <b>of</b> <b>face</b> pressure hypothesizes that face is context specific and the influence <b>of</b> <b>face</b> pressure will depend on the consumption context. A scale to measure face pressure is developed and, over four studies, evidence is provided t...|$|R

40|$|Face gear {{dynamics}} {{is addressed}} by many scholars. However, dynamic behaviors <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks {{are yet to}} be investigated. Thus, in the study, a calculation solution of static transmission errors (STE) <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks is constructed, based on the proposed equivalent face gear drives, and a four-degree-of-freedom (DOF) dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives is formulated. The dynamic behaviors of an example case <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives associated with pinion dedendum fatigue cracks are investigated. The simulation results indicate natural frequencies <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives would be decreased with pinion dedendum fatigue crack extensions; the relationship between accelerations and velocities <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives, dynamic mesh forces, and vibration accelerations at bearings would also be changed. However, pinion dedendum fatigue cracks <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives are detected difficultly, due to simulation result similarities. Therefore, a determination solution for pinion dedendum fatigue cracks <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives is proposed. The result shows a trend of vibration accelerations at bearings, namely, a first decreasing and then increasing tendency, which could be beneficial to detecting pinion dedendum fatigue cracks <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives. These contributions would improve engineering applications <b>of</b> <b>face</b> gear drives in the future...|$|R

Sailing south around Cape Horn and staying well off shore to avoid shipping that might report Shenandoah's position, they saw no land for another 9,000 miles until they arrived back in England, having logged a total of over 58,000 miles around the world in a year's travel—the only Confederate ship to circumnavigate the globe.|$|E
5|$|The {{bombs and}} fire lances of the Jin {{were the only}} two weapons of the Jurchens that the Mongols were wary <b>of</b> <b>facing.</b> The Jurchen {{deployment}} of gunpowder was extensive, but it is not certain if the Mongols had acquired gunpowder from the Jurchens before this point. Herbert Franke maintains that gunpowder was in the arsenal of both combatants, but Turnbull believes that only the Jurchens made use of it. The Mongols loaded their catapults with large stones or bombs of gunpowder, which were fired at the Jin fortifications. The barrage inflicted casualties in the city and had a psychological impact on the soldiers operating the Jurchen trebuchets.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, three-dimensional(3 -D) finite element(FE) {{method is}} {{used to analyze the}} {{stresses}} <b>of</b> <b>face</b> slab <b>of</b> the 300 m high concrete face rockfill dam(CFRD) before and after earthquake.

And there are compressive stresses in mostly area <b>of</b> <b>face</b> slab. After earthquake, the positions of maximum deflection and axial stress <b>of</b> <b>face</b> slab were changed to the crest of the central valley area. As the valley aspect ratio increases, compressive stress <b>of</b> <b>face</b> slab decreases. For the 300 m ultra-high CFRD, the maximum axial stresses exceed the concrete compressive strength before and after earthquake. Therefore, the compression damage <b>of</b> <b>face</b> slab should be considered during the design...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study face {{recognition}} in relative isolation from visual processes that may {{also contribute to}} object recognition and reading, we investigated CK, a man with normal face recognition but with object agnosia and dyslexia caused by a closed-head injury.

40|$|Tests <b>of</b> <b>face</b> {{recognition}} methods require {{large amounts}} <b>of</b> <b>face</b> images. This thesis investigates whether elements <b>of</b> <b>face</b> recognition methods {{can be used}} for the synthesis <b>of</b> new <b>face</b> images and thus are suitable for the simple generation <b>of</b> <b>face</b> image databases. Two of the best known face recognition methods, Elastic Bunch Graph Matching and the Eigenface-method were examined. The Eigenface-method for the synthesis <b>of</b> <b>face</b> images proved much more promising and thus was investigated in depth in this thesis. Since basic images of the Eigenface-method require the subject always {{to be in the same}} position and have uniform size the localisation <b>of</b> <b>faces</b> in images and their normalisation was performed by affine and radial transformation.

5|$|Before the Tests, Fingleton {{expected}} the English batsmen to struggle against Miller and Lindwall; he believed that, accustomed to prolific scoring against low-quality bowling in county cricket, these batsmen {{would be unable}} to adapt to the demands <b>of</b> <b>facing</b> world-class opposition. England won the toss and batted first on the opening morning of the First Test at Trent Bridge. There had been overnight rain, which meant that the pitch would initially be favourable towards fast bowlers. Opening the bowling with Lindwall, Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over, but it went to ground. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton with a faster ball, leaving England at 1/9. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad, but praised Miller for his ability to make occasional deliveries skid on faster, surprising the batsman.|$|E
5|$|Hulagu died in 1265, and was {{succeeded by}} Abaqa (1234–1282), who further pursued Western cooperation. Though a Buddhist, upon his {{succession}} he married Maria Palaiologina, an Orthodox Christian and the illegitimate {{daughter of the}} Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos. Abaqa corresponded with Pope Clement IV through 1267 and 1268, sending envoys to both Clement and King James I of Aragon. In a 1268 message to Clement, Abaqa promised to send troops to aid the Christians. It is unclear if this was what led to James's unsuccessful expedition to Acre in 1269. James initiated a small crusade, but a storm descended on his fleet as they attempted their crossing, forcing most of the ships to turn back. The crusade was ultimately handled by James's two sons Fernando Sanchez and Pedro Fernandez, who arrived in Acre in December 1269. Abaqa, despite his earlier promises of assistance, {{was in the process}} <b>of</b> <b>facing</b> another threat, an invasion in Khorasan by Mongols from Turkestan, and so could only commit a small force for the Holy Land, which did little but brandish the threat of an invasion along the Syrian frontier in October 1269.

Beaver is about {{to blow up the}} plane that has both Woody and Keith on it. Beaver pushes a button, and there is a flash in midair. Beaver tases Veronica before Logan appears, having read the text to Mac. The two steal Beaver's gun, and he ends up committing suicide instead <b>of</b> <b>facing</b> the consequences of his actions. Aaron and Kendall (Charisma Carpenter) are in bed, and while she is in the shower, Clarence Weidman (Christopher B. Duncan) appears and shoots him in the head. The scene moves to Australia, where we learn that Duncan organized the murder. Jackie meets Wallace and tells him that she {{had to go back to}} New York, where she is actually from, in order to care for her two-year-old son, whom she left with her mother, when she came to Neptune to reconnect with Terrence. Veronica learns that Keith is alive—he was not ever on the plane, but Woody was. Kendall receives $8 million, as Cassidy basically gave her the money as part of her plan. Veronica and Logan (Jason Dohring) rekindle their relationship. Kendall makes Keith a business proposal, and as a result, he misses their plane flight to New York.|$|E

40|$|The concept <b>of</b> {{psychological}} <b>face</b> space lies at {{the core}} of many theories <b>of</b> <b>face</b> recognition and representation.

In the present experiments, we investigated alternative accounts <b>of</b> <b>face</b> space and found that independent component analysis provided the best fit to human judgments <b>of</b> <b>face</b> similarity and identification. Thus, our results challenge an influential approach to the study <b>of</b> human <b>face</b> space and provide evidence for the role of statistically independent features in face encoding. In addition, our findings support the use of color information in the representation of facial identity, and we thus argue for the inclusion of such information in theoretical and computational constructs <b>of</b> <b>face</b> space...|$|R
