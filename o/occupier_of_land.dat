5|$|There is {{a general}} rule that a {{landlord}} who leases a property is not liable for nuisances created after the occupier takes control of the land. There is an exception where the lease is granted for a purpose which constitutes a nuisance, as in Tetley v Chitty, or where the nuisance is caused by their failure to repair the premises, as in Wringe v Cohen. The landlord is also liable were the nuisance existed before the land was let, and he knew or ought to have known about it. Under the principle of vicarious liability, an <b>occupier</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> can also be liable {{for the actions of}} their employees; in Matania v National Provincial Bank, it was also established that they could be liable for the activities of independent contractors under certain circumstances.|$|E
25|$|After {{this had}} the king a large meeting, and very deep {{consultation}} with his council, about this land; {{how it was}} occupied, and by what sort of men. Then sent he his men over all England into each shire; commissioning them to find out 'How many hundreds of hides were in the shire, what land the king himself had, and what stock upon the land; or, what dues {{he ought to have}} by the year from the shire.' Also he commissioned them to record in writing, 'How much land his archbishops had, and his diocesan bishops, and his abbots, and his earls;' and though I may be prolix and tedious, 'What, or how much, each man had, who was an <b>occupier</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> in England, either in land or in stock, and how much money it were worth.' So very narrowly, indeed, did he commission them to trace it out, that there was not one single hide, nor a yard of land, nay, moreover (it is shameful to tell, though he thought it no shame to do it), not even an ox, nor a cow, nor a swine was there left, that was not set down in his writ. And all the recorded particulars were afterwards brought to him.|$|E

[...] His name then appears as the <b>occupier</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> adjacent to the Little Bog River at Quinburra near Craigie on a 1902 map. [...] On the 1903 electoral roll, described as a mining manager, he appears with his wife and daughter Effie at Yambulla, another remote area straddling the NSW-Victorian border between Bombala and Eden.

2500|$|The {{party that}} can be sued in a Rylands claim is an owner or <b>occupier</b> <b>of</b> <b>land,</b> along with anyone who stores or {{collects}} the dangerous material, as in Rainham Chemical Works Ltd v Belvedere Fish Guano Co Ltd. The party suing was initially one {{with an interest in}} land, but Perry v Kendricks Transport Ltd confirmed that an interest in land was not necessary to bring a claim. Historically, personal injury claims have been allowed, as in Hale v Jennings. More recent cases, however, such as the House of Lords decision in Transco plc v Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council, have confirmed that Rylands is [...] "a remedy for damage to land or interests in land. It must...follow that damages for personal injuries are not recoverable under the rule".|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} endless {{to point out}} the oddities and incongruities which result from this classification. Whether we take the words wealth and {{production}} in the largest, or in the most restricted sense in which they have ever yet been employed, nobody will dispute that roads, bridges, and canals, contribute in an eminent degree, and in a very direct manner, to the increase of production and wealth. The labour and pecuniary resources employed in their construction would, according to the above theory, be considered productive, if every <b>occupier</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> were compelled by law to construct so much of the road, or canal, as passes through his own farm. If, instead of this, the government makes the road, and throws it open to the public toll-free, the labour and expenditure would be, on the above system, clearly unproductive. But if the government, or an association of individuals, made the road, and imposed a toll to defray the expense, we do not see how these writers could refuse to the outlay the title of productive expenditure. It would follow, that the very same labour and expense, if given gratuitously, must be called unproductive, which, if a charge had been made for it, would have been called productive.|$|E

25|$|According to Litton, evictions {{might have}} taken place earlier but for fear of the secret societies. However, they were now greatly {{weakened}} by the Famine.

5000|$|The church {{rate was}} a {{personal}} charge imposed on the <b>occupier</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> or of {{a house in the}} parish, and, though it was compulsory, much difficulty was found in effectually applying the compulsion.

5000|$|At common law, disclaimers {{can also}} have effect as {{conditions}} of a license (i.e. permission) to enter land. An <b>occupier</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> will have certain duties to take care for the personal safety of people he or she allows onto the premises. By placing a sign {{at the entrance to}} the premises, such as [...] "visitors enter at their own risk", the occupier may be able to stop entrants successfully suing in tort for damage or injury caused by the unsafe nature of the premises. Warnings or disclaimers contained in signs may, by a slightly different legal analysis leading to the same result, allow the person who would otherwise be responsible to rely on the defense of consent.|$|E
50|$|Carey {{believed}} that the overcoming of these difficulties by arduous and continued effort entitles the first <b>occupier</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> to his property in the soil. Its present value forms a very small proportion of the cost expended on it, because it represents only what would be required, with the science and appliances of our time, to bring the land from its primitive into its present state. Thus, property in land is only a form of invested capital, a quantity of labour or the fruits of labour permanently incorporated with the soil. The owner of this capital is compensated, as any other capitalist, by {{a share of the}} produce. The owner is not rewarded for what is done by the powers of nature, and society is in no sense defrauded by his sole possession.|$|E
