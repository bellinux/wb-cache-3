However, {{he did not}} want to sell the rights until the series was finished. He had done so with a previous work, and it affected the way he wrote it because he was imagining it in the other medium.|$|E
5|$|Further work {{along these}} lines led to the Nike-X Deployment Study, or DEPEX. DEPEX {{outlined}} a deployment that started <b>out</b> <b>very</b> similar to Nth Country, with a few bases primarily using Nike EX to provide lightweight cover, but which also included design features that allowed more bases to be added as {{the nature of the}} threat changed. The study described a four-phase deployment sequence that added more and more terminal defenses as the sophistication of the Nth Country missiles increased over time.|$|E
5|$|Sasuke is the remarkable, sole {{survivor}} of the once powerful Uchiha clan of Konoha. At age seven, he survived the massacre of his entire clan {{at the hands of}} his brother, Itachi Uchiha, who spared his life only because he deemed Sasuke unworthy to kill. When first assigned to Team 7, Sasuke is antisocial, superior and unwilling to cooperate with his team members, Naruto Uzumaki and Sakura Haruno, but he eventually concedes that they are useful. Sasuke awakens his Sharingan, the inherited ability of the Uchiha clan to see through illusions (genjutsu), which allows him to see and learn imperceptible movements at a super-human rate. As time passes, Sasuke seeks <b>out</b> <b>very</b> strong opponents in order to convince himself that he is growing physically.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} {{undertaking}} for Task Force 113 (now redesignated TF.57) was Operation Iceberg-offshore {{support for the}} US landings at Okinawa-which got under way on 1 April 1945. The force was subjected to sporadic Japanese kamikaze attacks, but the two ships emerged unscathed from these actions. Howe's anti-aircraft batteries also succeeded in shooting down an attacking kamikaze plane. The two ships' principal roles were air defence and land bombardment, the latter being carried <b>out</b> <b>very</b> accurately, particularly by Howe against anti-aircraft installations {{on the island of}} Miyako, half way between Okinawa and Formosa.|$|E
5|$|After King Inge's {{death in}} 1217, a dispute erupted over {{who was to}} become his successor. In {{addition}} to Haakon who gained {{the support of the}} majority of the birkebeiners including the veterans who had served under his father and grandfather, candidates included Inge's illegitimate son Guttorm (who dropped <b>out</b> <b>very</b> soon), Inge's half-brother Earl Skule Bårdsson who had been appointed leader of the king's hird at Inge's deathbed and was supported by the Archbishop of Nidaros as well as part of the birkebeiners, and Haakon the Crazy's son Knut Haakonsson. With his widespread popular support in Trøndelag and in Western Norway, Haakon was proclaimed king at Øyrating in June 1217. He was later the same year hailed as king at Gulating in Bergen, and at Haugating, Borgarting and local things east of Elven (Göta Älv). While Skule's supporters initially had attempted to cast doubt about Haakon's royal ancestry, they eventually suspended open resistance to his candidacy. As the dispute could have threatened to split the birkebeiners in two, Skule settled on becoming regent for Haakon during his minority.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} season, Gilchrist made a {{comeback}} for his final IPL stint. He stated the reason {{as being the}} Kings XI management's decision to renew his contract for another season. An interesting change in the team staff was the induction of Darren Lehmann as the new Kings XI coach. This brought together the duo of Gilchrist and Lehmann who had guided their previous franchise, the Deccan Chargers to its 2009 IPL victory. Some good performances by the players led the Kings XI Punjab team eyeing for the fourth spot in the play-offs and a possible maiden win under Gilchrist's leadership. They were knocked <b>out</b> <b>very</b> late in the tournament. In his final game at IPL, Gilchrist decided to bowl the last over of the match against the Mumbai Indians, where he got the wicket of Harbhajan Singh of his first ball, securing KXIP's victory in the match. In a recent press conference, Gilchrist has confirmed {{that this will be}} his final IPL season and that he was looking forward to a fresh start in the inaugural Caribbean Premier League in July 2013.|$|E

5|$|The tentacles of cydippid ctenophores are {{typically}} fringed with tentilla ("little tentacles"), {{although a few}} genera have simple tentacles without these sidebranches. The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered with microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and {{is attached to the}} head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart. In addition to colloblasts, members of the genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jellyfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla of all other known ctenophores elongate when relaxed. Euplokamis tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they may flick <b>out</b> <b>very</b> quickly (in 40 to 60milliseconds); they can wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; and they coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoiling movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.|$|E

25|$|Testaments are {{regarded}} as exhortatory writings; ethics therefore are fundamental to the text.

Usually this is then concluded with a very vague and general reference to God's law and commandments.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the idea}} {{does not appear}} quite {{definitely}} expressed in Darwin's discussion {{of the development of}} mental powers, it seems quite clear that his main object has been to express his conviction that the mental faculties developed essentially without a purposive end, but they originated as variations, and were continued by natural selection.
