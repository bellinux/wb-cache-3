5|$|A {{defendant}} must {{be given}} an opportunity to retain counsel, even if not entitled to appointed counsel. Subject to considerations such as conflicts of interest, scheduling, counsel's authorization to practice law in the jurisdiction, and counsel's willingness to represent the defendant (whether pro bono <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fee), criminal defendants {{have a right to be}} represented by counsel of their choice. The remedy for erroneous depravation of first choice counsel is automatic reversal.|$|E
5|$|Construction of Buddhist temples, {{including}} Borobudur, at {{that time}} was possible because Sanjaya's immediate successor, Rakai Panangkaran, granted his permission to the Buddhist followers to build such temples. In fact, to show his respect, Panangkaran gave the village of Kalasan to the Buddhist community, as is written in the Kalasan Charter dated 778 CE. This has led some archaeologists to believe that there was never serious conflict concerning religion in Java as it was possible for a Hindu king to patronize the establishment of a Buddhist monument; <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Buddhist king to act likewise. However, it is likely that there were two rival royal dynasties in Java at the time—the Buddhist Sailendra and the Saivite Sanjaya—in which the latter triumphed over their rival in the 856 battle on the Ratubaka plateau. Similar confusion also exists regarding the Lara Jonggrang temple at the Prambanan complex, which was believed to have been erected by the victor Rakai Pikatan as the Sanjaya dynasty's reply to Borobudur, but others suggest that there was a climate of peaceful coexistence where Sailendra involvement exists in Lara Jonggrang.|$|E

5|$|In the 4th century, {{as during}} the Principate, these forces were {{organised}} into ill-defined units based on a single ethnic group called numeri ("troops", although numerus was also {{the name of a}} regular infantry unit). They served alongside the regular army for the duration of particular campaigns <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> specified period. Normally their service would be limited to the region where the tribe lived, but sometimes could be deployed elsewhere. They were commanded by their own leaders. It is unclear whether they used their own weapons and armour or the standard equipment of the Roman army. In the late army, the more useful and long-serving numeri appear to have been absorbed into the regular late army, rapidly becoming indistinguishable from other units.|$|E
5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, the object of the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration the object of the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers the object of the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, {{a report}} {{on the quality of the}} walls around 1460 noted that on the north and east sides of Southampton, the walls were still too thin to block a cannon shot <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> man to stand on them; a wood and earth wall-walk had been built behind the walls, but this was proving very {{expensive}} to maintain. This contemporary assessment of the weakness of the eastern walls has been confirmed by modern archaeological excavation – in places it was only 0.76 m (2.49 feet) thick, compared to a typical thickness in other English town walls of around 1 m (3.28 feet).|$|E

5|$|Teams {{have the}} option of trading their picks to other teams in {{exchange}} for different picks, players, money, or a combination thereof. It is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades. Of the players selected in each draft and throughout its history, East Carolina has had 63 players picked.|$|E
5|$|The Atlanta Falcons, a {{professional}} American football team based in Atlanta, {{are part of}} the National Football Conference South Division. They joined the National Football League (NFL) as an expansion team for the 1966 season and became the first NFL franchise in the Southeastern United States. They first participated in the 1966 NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting, more commonly known as the NFL Draft. In the NFL Draft, each NFL franchise annually seeks to add new players to its roster. Teams are ranked in reverse order based on the previous season's record, with the worst record picking first, the second-worst picking second and so on. The two exceptions to this order are made for teams that appeared in the previous Super Bowl; the Super Bowl champion always picks 32nd, and the Super Bowl loser always picks 31st. Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or a combination thereof. Thus, {{it is not uncommon for}} a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades.|$|E
5|$|The New Orleans Saints {{joined the}} National Football League (NFL) as an {{expansion}} team in 1967 and first {{participated in the}} 1967 NFL Annual Player Selection Meeting, more {{commonly known as the}} NFL Draft. In the NFL Draft, each NFL franchise annually seeks to add new players to its roster. Teams are ranked in inverse order based on the previous season's record, with the worst record picking first, and the second-worst picking second and so on. The team which wins the Super Bowl receives the last pick in the subsequent Draft, with the penultimate pick going to the losing team. Teams have the option of trading away their picks to other teams for different picks, players, cash, or a combination thereof. Thus, {{it is not uncommon for}} a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these trades.|$|E

5|$|When South Africa {{became a}} {{republic}} in 1961, the flag remained the same. The Afrikaner voting majority disliked the flag retaining the Union Jack in the centre. Repeated calls {{were made for}} it to be removed <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new flag but no action was taken by the ruling National Party until 1968. B.J. Vorster convened a commission in that year to create a new flag in time for the 10th anniversary of South Africa's declaration of independence in 1971, but no changes were eventually made. The flag was treated with respect by Afrikaners with daily flag salutes in schools. It was also used as part of celebrations of the inauguration of the State President.|$|E
5|$|YouTube {{does not}} usually offer a {{download}} link for its videos, and intends {{for them to}} be viewed through its website interface. A small number of videos, such as the weekly addresses by President Barack Obama, can be downloaded as MP4 files. Numerous third-party web sites, applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download YouTube videos. In February 2009, YouTube announced a test service, allowing some partners to offer video downloads for free <b>or</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fee paid through Google Checkout. In June 2012, Google sent cease and desist letters threatening legal action against several websites offering online download and conversion of YouTube videos. In response, Zamzar removed the ability to download YouTube videos from its site.|$|E
