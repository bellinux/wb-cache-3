5|$|Although {{political}} parties fund their campaigns using donations <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> assets, the government reimburses them for each parliamentary seat won. For instance, each seat {{won in the}} 2011 parliamentary election brought a party 180,000kuna (euros). Smaller sums were paid to parties or candidates failing to win any parliamentary seats, provided that they received more than {{five percent of the}} votes cast in a constituency.|$|E
5|$|Some {{nucleic acids}} of RNA viruses {{function}} directly as mRNA without further modification. For this reason, these viruses are called positive-sense RNA viruses. In other RNA viruses, the RNA is a complementary copy of mRNA and these viruses {{rely on the}} cell's <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> enzyme to make mRNA. These are called negative-sense RNA viruses. In viruses made from DNA, the method of mRNA production {{is similar to that}} of the cell. The species of viruses called retroviruses behave completely differently: they have RNA, but inside the host cell a DNA copy of their RNA is made with the help of the enzyme reverse transcriptase. This DNA is then incorporated into the host's own DNA, and copied into mRNA by the cell's normal pathways.|$|E
5|$|After {{his death}} Menkauhor enjoyed a funerary cult {{centered}} on his pyramid complex. The cult lasted {{at least until}} {{the second half of the}} Sixth Dynasty, nearly 150 years later. Provisions for this cult were produced in dedicated agricultural domains that were established during Menkauhor's lifetime. Products of these domains were delivered to Menkauhor's sun and mortuary temples and distributed to the priests of the cult, who could use them for their sustenance <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> funerary cults. Personified representations of Menkauhor's agricultural domains are depicted bringing offerings on the walls of the mastabas of these priests. Most of the depictions are located in Saqqara North, near the pyramid complex of Djoser. This area comprises the tombs of Neferiretptah, Raemankh, Duare, Iti, Sekhemnefer, Snofrunefer, Akhethotep, Ptahhotep and Qednes, all priests of the funerary cult of Menkauhor. Further tombs of priests of this cult are found to the north, in Abusir South, with the mastaba of Isesiseneb and Rahotep and in Giza.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his lecture}} series, Blackstone became more {{prominent}} in convocation and other university activities. Oxford and Cambridge {{at the time}} had a strange system of law; due to their unique natures, they had exclusive jurisdiction over both academics and students in a fashion which followed either the common law <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> customs, based on the civil law. With his appointment as assessor (or chief legal officer) of the Chancellor's Court, Blackstone became far {{more involved in the}} university's peculiar legal system, and records show him sitting between eight and ten times a year from 1753 to 1759, mainly dealing with small claims of debt. He also wrote a manual on the Court's practice, and through his position gained a large number of contacts and connections, as well as visibility, which aided his legal career significantly. This period also saw Blackstone write his last known piece of poetry, Friendship: An Ode, in 1756.|$|E

As a result, Clarke was suspended by the council on 6 August 2015. In giving evidence the DVLA admitted its self-declaration system had a weakness, since it allowed applicants to be assessed by either an employer-appointed occupational-health doctor <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> GP, and occupational-health doctors would not usually {{have access to the}} applicant's medical records.|$|E
25|$|Some lakinyeri {{may have}} {{disappeared}} and {{others may have}} merged {{as a result of}} population decline following colonisation. Additionally, family groups within the lakinyerar would use the local dialect <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> family groups name for lakinyeri names, also leading to confusion. For example, Jaralde, Jaraldi, Jarildekald and Jarildikald were separate family groups names as were Ramindjari, Ramindjerar, Ramindjeri, Ramingara, Raminjeri, Raminyeri. Several of these are also used as names for the lakinyerar. Family groups could also change their lakinyeri, Berndt found that two Tangani family groups who lived close to a Yaraldi family group had picked up their dialect and were thus now considered to be Yaraldi.|$|E
25|$|Most venues {{featured}} on the tour opt for Ticketmaster as the only official ticket sales merchant. However, some venues have chosen to use either other companies, <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> ticket selling resource. High ticket demand has a pattern of causing stress on these alternative systems. On September 18, 2015 AXS, the merchant selling online tickets to Brooks' San Diego shows, became overwhelmed by demand for tickets {{and was forced to}} halt the sale; tickets were later sold the following week. A similar situation occurred on March 18, 2016 when Fargo, North Dakota's Fargodome independent ticket sales website crashed, prompting a later sales date as well.|$|E

Citing the orders of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Paquet told the grand jury that it could not see the evidence or Boyle's report from the inquest, which were still impounded. Dinis, who had attended the inquest and seen Boyle's report, told the grand jury that there was not enough evidence to indict Kennedy on potential charges of manslaughter, perjury or driving to endanger. The grand jury called four witnesses who had not testified at the inquest: they testified for a total of 20 minutes, but no indictments were issued.|$|E
25|$|Kappa are {{not entirely}} {{antagonistic}} to human beings. They are curious about human civilization, and they can understand and speak Japanese. They may even befriend human beings in exchange for gifts or offerings of nasu (茄子, Japanese eggplant), soba (そば or 蕎麦, buckwheat noodles), nattō (なっとう or 納豆, fermented soybeans), or kabocha (カボチャ, 南瓜, winter squash), but especially cucumbers, the only food kappa are known to enjoy more than human children. Japanese parents sometimes write {{the names of their}} children, <b>or</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> names, on cucumbers and toss them into waters believed to be infested with kappa in order to mollify the creatures and allow the family to bathe. In some regions, it was customary to eat cucumbers before swimming as protection, but in others it was believed that this act would guarantee an attack.
