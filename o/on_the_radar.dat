5|$|Night falls, and Captain Magenta detects {{an unusual}} signal in the Cloudbase Radar Room. Rhapsody Angel is {{launched}} {{to investigate and}} finds that the readings are emanating from a spinning Mysteron spacecraft, which obliterates her interceptor in mid-air. To prevent civilian casualties on the ground, Cloudbase is moved into Himalayan airspace on its horizontal thrusters, while its personnel prepare for the inevitable final confrontation. When more spacecraft appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar,</b> Captain Scarlet volunteers to challenge the Mysterons in Destiny's place, but crash-lands on the Cloudbase flight deck after his interceptor is damaged.|$|E
5|$|The Wild Weasels {{also carried}} {{electronic}} countermeasures (ECM) equipment to protect themselves. They directed flak suppression strikes and carried AGM-45 Shrike anti-radiation missiles (another Navy development), which homed in <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> {{systems of the}} SAMs. The SA-2 had greater range than the Shrike, but if the Shrike was launched and the radar operator stayed on the air, the American missile would home in on the signal and destroy the radar source. A sophisticated cat and mouse game then ensued between North Vietnamese radar operators and the Wild Weasel pilots.|$|E

5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to an ever-increasing list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required an ever-increasing number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} this was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing a button <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar,</b> which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} weapons are {{available}} including handguns, automatic weapons and shotguns, with various ammunition types also in existence. Ammunition {{is limited in}} the game and weapons must be reloaded, although additional ammunition can be collected. Players can also call out to enemies who will sometimes surrender and can then be captured (put in handcuffs) with their ammunition also collected. There are also civilians in the game who can also be called out to and then rescued by the player. Health bars for enemies, vehicles or friendly subjects that must be protected are also sometimes shown. There are health packs which can be picked up, as well as health stations mounted on walls which can be used. Body armor is also sometimes provided or found in levels. A small heads-up-display features a radar/map with an arrow showing the character's direction, red dots for enemies, green dots for civilians, and yellow stars for objectives. The direction and field of vision of enemies is shown <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar.</b>|$|E
5|$|For 11 {{hours the}} German fleet sailed from Brest into the English Channel to the Dover Straits. By chance, a {{mechanic}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> station at Fairlight, East Sussex {{had just finished}} repairing the equipment when he picked up 27 echos at 10:15 on 12 February, south of Cap Gris Nez. The information was relayed to Vice-Admiral Bertram Ramsay, who ordered his Air Officer liaison to contact No. 11 Group RAF to ask for armed reconnaissance. Ramsay also warned No. 16 Group RAF and the FAA squadron operating out of RAF Manston that there were possible targets were in the Channel, despite not knowing the exact number or size of the enemy vessels. The performance of the radar was down to the jamming of the sets (Ballstöranlage) by two Heinkel He 111s which had been flying off the south coast from their airfield near Paris. The flights ceased at 09:00 when installations along the French coast had taken over. The detection by Fairlight {{was a piece of}} good fortune, the Germans had assumed it to be out of action. Ten Dornier Do 217s from III./KG 2 flew missions against Plymouth harbour and airfield, while 15 flew diversion missions to keep RAF fighters clear of the He 111s.|$|E

40|$|Design {{specifications}} for this array has been derived based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar's</b> required sectoral coverage available DVB-T transmitters {{in the vicinity}} of the Oslo fjord. An 11 element horizontal linear array with dual polarized elements was found suitable for the application, where the bandwidth of the array should at least cover 622 MHz to 726 MHz, corresponding to DVB-T channels 40 - 52.|$|R
5|$|Luftflotte 2 {{was well}} {{used in this}} way. Operations against Kenley, Biggin Hill, North Weald and Hornchurch had the {{potential}} to destroy 11 Group's major sector stations and impair its defences. It would also draw the defending fighters into battle. The attempt to attack Kenley, however, failed and 9 Staffel KG 76 paid a high price. The weather prevented any chance of the raids on Hornchurch and North Weald being successful. On the other hand, Luftflotte 3 had poor intelligence, and its raids <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> stations were ineffective. Radar elimination would enable the Luftwaffe to destroy the command and control system of Fighter Command, but despite the severe damage done to the Poling station, the existence of other stations nearby gave the system plenty of cover. The airfields the Air Fleet attacked at Ford, Gosport and Thorney Island {{had nothing to do with}} the main battle as they belonged to Coastal Command and the FAA. Sperrle and his command remained unaware of their errors in intelligence.|$|E

50|$|With the aid {{of modern}} {{communications}} systems, the information from a single radar can be rapidly disseminated over long distances. This allows <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> to notify multiple batteries {{as well as provide}} early warning to the friendly targets. Modern counter-battery radar can locate hostile batteries up to about 50 km away depending <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar's</b> capabilities and <b>the</b> terrain and weather. Some counter-battery radars {{can also be used to}} track the fire of friendly artillery and calculate corrections to adjust its fire onto a particular place, but this is usually a secondary mission objective.|$|R

30|$|Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{available}} <b>radar</b> data products, it is {{not possible}} to distinguish different lithologies in the larger area but it is possible to clearly separate bedrock units from unconsolidated materials based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> respective <b>radar</b> backscatter with high radar reflectance for bedrock units and low reflectance for unconsolidated material. H/α-plane analysis showed that <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> backscatter is derived from surface units mainly and that the subsurface component is of minor relevance. The combination of various primary and secondary radar datasets helped to look into the overall geologic and geomorphologic settings in more detail than currently freely available optical image data could provide.|$|R

25|$|The {{first such}} device, the AN/APA-46 Adapter Assembly, allowed the {{operator}} to sight through the Norden at four (or five {{depending on the}} model) locations during the approach. This was quickly replaced by the APA-47, which updated the Norden continuously. This allowed the bombardier to concentrate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> display during the approach, and, if the conditions were favourable, move to the Norden {{at the last minute}} to achieve higher accuracy.|$|E
25|$|In the April 1957 West Freugh {{incident}} in Scotland, {{named after the}} principal military base involved, two unidentified objects flying high over the UK were tracked by radar operators. The objects were reported to operate at speeds and perform maneuvers beyond the capability of any known craft. Also significant is their alleged size, which– based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> returns – was closer {{to that of a}} ship than an aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> contact on 6 March, moon {{conditions}} and {{assumptions of the}} Japanese force's speed and likely flying off positions if it included any aircraft carriers, the Allied militaries judged that any attack on the Fremantle-Perth area was most likely to occur during {{the early hours of}} 11 March. However, it was possible that such an attack could be conducted any time between the night of 9/10 March and the morning of 14 March.|$|E
25|$|Even as the Nike was {{undergoing}} testing, planners grew {{concerned about the}} missile's ability to attack formations of aircraft. Given the low resolution of <b>the</b> tracking <b>radars</b> available at <b>the</b> time, a formation of aircraft would appear <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radars</b> as a single larger return. Launched against such a formation, the Nike would fly towards {{the center of the}} composite return. Given the Nike warhead's relatively small lethal radius, if the missile flew {{into the middle of the}} formation and exploded, it would be highly unlikely to destroy any of the aircraft.|$|R

25|$|Speed is {{the change}} in {{distance}} to an object with respect to time. Thus the existing system for measuring distance, combined with a memory capacity {{to see where the}} target last was, is enough to measure speed. At one time the memory consisted of a user making grease pencil marks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>radar</b> screen and then calculating the speed using a slide rule. Modern radar systems perform the equivalent operation faster and more accurately using computers.|$|E
25|$|Hillman {{decided to}} enlist shortstop Tony Peña, Jr. to pitch {{the ninth inning}} for the Royals.
