Yet the Quakers have had a long and honorable part in the growth of our nation, and an amicus curiae brief filed in their behalf informs us that, under the test applied to this petitioner, not one of them, if true to the tenets of their faith, could qualify for the bar in Illinois. And {{it is obvious that the}} same disqualification would exist as to every conscientious objector to the use of force, even though the Congress of the United States should continue its practice of absolving them from military service. The conclusion seems to me inescapable that, if Illinois can bar this petitioner from the practice of law it can bar every person from every public occupation solely because he believes in nonresistance, rather than in force.|$|E

Eagleson was involved there too, arranging for the players {{to give up a}} seat on the trusteeship of the pension fund in 1969 to gain the acceptance of the NHLPA with the NHL owners. Orr and ex-Bruin Dave Forbes discussed the lawsuit with the sports newspaper The National. Orr: [...] "Our money is being used to pay pensions for current players". The NHL's response was to file a notice of libel and slander against Orr and Forbes. Carl Brewer defended Orr in a letter to then-NHL president John Ziegler: [...] "It is regrettable that the NHL and the member clubs would resort to such treatment <b>of</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> game's icons, Bobby Orr. And isn't it interesting that baseball players who started their pension plan in 1947, as did the NHL, have assets in their plan of some US$500 million while we, {{as far as we can}} understand, have US$31.9 million." [...] The pension lawsuit was finally won by the players in 1994 after two courts ruled against the NHL. The NHL had appealed the case to the Supreme Court of Canada which decided not to hear the case.|$|E

The anger, the hatred, the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous." [...] He believed that Arizona had unfortunately become [...] "the capital" [...] of such feelings. [...] "We have become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry," [...] he said. But, Dupnik later said that he had no evidence that the killings were a result of anything particular which Loughner may have read or heard. International media referred to the {{political climate}} in the United States and the Palin map in particular. The French newspaper Le Monde said that the attack seemed to confirm [...] "an alarming premonition that has been gaining momentum for a long time: that the verbal and symbolic violence that the most radical right-wing opponents have used in their clash with the Obama administration would at some point lead to tragic physical violence." [...] President Obama called the shooting an [...] "unspeakable tragedy", adding that [...] "such a senseless and terrible act of violence has no place in a free society". Arizona Governor Jan Brewer called the attack [...] "senseless and cruel violence" [...] and House Speaker John Boehner said, [...] "An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve.
