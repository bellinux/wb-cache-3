Brian was thoroughly in control of those guys. He said, “I’m gonna make you guys feel better. I think some <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys</b> might have colds.” Then he had everybody open their mouths and Diane or Marilyn Wilson sprayed some kind of a cough medicine.

5000|$|During a {{performance}} at the Avalon Theater in Salt Lake City, Utah, on September 6, 2006, frontman Dave Elkins made the following statement before the band performed [...] "Mistakes We Knew We Were Making" [...] (transcribed from video previously posted on YouTube):I hope {{you know how much}} fun we’re having up here because <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys.</b> Well, this next song is a hypothetical story of a couple who falls in love; they’ve decided what they’re looking for and they find it in each other…and it’s very good, it’s very rewarding; but…well, not “but” but alongside of this, or as a result of this, an unborn baby comes into the picture before too long. And {{a lot of people have}} wondered and talked to us at shows, and I’ve seen it discussed on message boards and whatnot, and a lot of people thought this song is a story about an abortion or this song is a story stating us as pro-choice or pro-life, and that’s not necessarily the case here. What we’re looking at is the fact that as a result of this baby entering into the world, they find a love, these individuals, that’s more fulfilling and more rewarding, and more satisfying, than anything they had known up until that point. Cheering I think that it’s important that we understand that love is not always black and white like we’d like for it to be, and sometimes it’s very grey. Sometimes you have to make the difficult decisions. And sometimes you do have to try and fail, and fail and fail a few times before you can actually succeed and get the big picture. And I think that’s exactly what this song is really all about. And this song is called “Mistakes We Knew We Were Making.” ...|$|E

"For {{those of}} you who are curious as to what our [...] "legal issues" [...] were that halted the {{production}} of Dingir, and pushed its official release date from Nov. 20th, 2012 to Feb 5th, 2013, we are able to explain them now. A third party was legally fighting us for the rights to our name using a loop hole method that renders the protection of our copyright obsolete in that specific circumstance. After butt loads of money was dropped in attorney and legal fees, we were able to keep our name as well as take precautions to ensure that this sort of thing never happens to us again. During this time, someone leaked an unfinished, poor quality pre-production version of our album months before our new release date. In light of the album being pushed back, and the leak, we decided to just stream the entire high quality finished version of the album on Youtube for everyone, as well as make it available for download, and put up the guitar tabs on ultimate-guitar.com for people who were interested in learning our songs. We know you guys had been waiting for the album long enough, and we would rather have you all jam out to the high quality finished album, then a poor quality unfinished product. This third party that was trying to steal our name away from us, and got our albums release date pushed back will not be named, because we know that you guys will go absolutely apeshit on them for doing that to us. We have full trust that you guys will support the band and still pick up a copy of Dingir when our album drops on Feb. 5th, 2013 so that we can hit the road again on tour, and hang out, and play for all <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>guys!</b> We are currently working on pre-order packages, a music video, and something else special for everyone that we will be releasing starting on our album's original release date of Nov. 20th, 2012!" ...|$|E
