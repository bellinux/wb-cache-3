5|$|In 1868 and 1869, judgements {{went against}} the Met {{in a number of}} hearings, finding {{financial}} irregularities such as the company paying a dividend it could not afford and expenses being paid out of the capital account. In 1870, its directors were found guilty of a breach <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> ordered to compensate the company. Although they all appealed and were allowed in 1874 to settle for a much lower amount, to restore shareholders' confidence the directors had all been replaced by October 1872 and Edward Watkin appointed chairman. Watkin was an experienced railwayman and already on the board of several railway companies, including the South Eastern Railway (SER), and had an aspiration to construct a line from the north through London to that railway.|$|E
5|$|Technically, a slave {{could not}} own property, but a slave who {{conducted}} business might be {{given access to}} an individual account or fund (peculium) that he could use {{as if it were}} his own. The terms of this account varied depending on the degree <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> co-operation between owner and slave: a slave with an aptitude for business could be given considerable leeway to generate profit, and might be allowed to bequeath the peculium he managed to other slaves of his household. Within a household or workplace, a hierarchy of slaves might exist, with one slave in effect acting as the master of other slaves.|$|E
5|$|Varian {{was one of}} a {{very few}} experts in the 21st century who was still {{teaching}} about vaquero equipment, methods, and history. She had a strong interest {{in the history of the}} spade bit horse in California. The spade is an elaborate, complex bit that can only be properly used on a highly trained horse handled by a skilled rider. In the vaquero tradition, its use represents the highest level <b>of</b> <b>trust</b> <b>and</b> communication between horse and rider. The process of training the spade bit horse takes five to seven years to complete. Its emphasis has always been on producing a finely tuned working horse and partner, emphasizing quality rather than on how quickly the goal is reached. The conformation of the horse is also a factor; to become a spade bit horse, the animal must be bred to have a higher neck set and well-carried head. Varian compared the ride and handling of a horse trained in this manner to that of a Jaguar automobile.|$|E
