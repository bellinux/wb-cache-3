2500|$|The {{camouflage}} {{effect was}} designed by R/Greenberg Associates, {{under the direction of}} Joel Hynek. The idea for the effect came in a dream one of the Thomas brothers (who wrote the film) had, in which there was a chrome man who was inside a reflective sphere. The man blended in, perfectly camouflaged, reflecting from all directions and only visible when in motion. It took quite a while before they figured <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> which was basically an image repeated in a pattern of ripples {{in the shape of the}} Predator's body. It proved very effective and was a new way of presenting an [...] "invisible man." [...] Before there was digital rendering technology all of the camouflage was done optically using photo-chemical means, so that one would never get the same result twice from combining the same pieces of film.|$|E

60|$|Both he and General Castelnau {{were anxious}} that I {{should see a}} French {{offensive}} sector as well as Soissons. Then I should understand. And since then I have returned from Italy and I have seen and I do understand. The Allied offensive was winning; that is to say, it was inflicting far greater losses than it experienced; it was steadily beating the spirit out of the German army and shoving it back towards Germany. Only peace can, I believe, prevent the western war ending in Germany. And it is the Frenchmen mainly who have worked <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

But did any of their disciples ever succeed in {{governing}} you for a single day on their Christ-like principles? It {{is not enough to}} know what is good: you must be able to do it. They couldn't do it because they did not live long enough to find <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> or to outlive the childish passions that prevented them from really wanting to do it. You know very well that they could only keep order--such as it was--by the very coercion and militarism they were denouncing and deploring. They had actually to kill one another for preaching their own gospel, or be killed themselves.|$|E

5000|$|You can't {{possibly}} {{get a good}} technology going without {{an enormous number of}} failures. It's a universal rule.

Even now, after we've been building them for 100 years, it's very difficult to understand just why a bicycle works - it's even difficult to formulate it as a mathematical problem. But just by trial and error, we found <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> and the error was essential.|$|E
