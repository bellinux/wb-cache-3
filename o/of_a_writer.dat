5|$|On 17 February 2014, Rowling {{announced}} that the second Cormoran Strike novel, named The Silkworm, would be released in June 2014. It sees Strike investigating the disappearance <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> hated by many of his old friends for insulting them in his new novel.|$|E
5|$|While {{the central}} plot is a murder mystery, the initial idea was <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> with PTSD who cannot write and is instead {{fronting}} for his blacklisted best friend. Throughout the series, Brubaker switched between first- and third-person narration because it {{allowed him to}} tell a broader story. He was also {{trying to create a}} layered story that would reward repeated reading, so he avoided extraneous details. When writing the scripts, Brubaker listened to music from the 1940s to stay in the right frame of mind.|$|E
5|$|A {{potential}} Agent Carter {{series was}} initially {{brought up in}} July 2013 by Louis D'Esposito, after a screening of his Agent Carter One-Shot at San Diego Comic-Con. By September, Marvel Television was developing a series inspired by the short film, featuring Peggy Carter, and was in search <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> for the series. In January 2014, ABC Entertainment Group president Paul Lee confirmed that the show was in development, and revealed that Tara Butters and Michele Fazekas would act as the series' showrunners. Chris Dingess {{also serves as a}} showrunner. In March 2014, Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely, writers of the Captain America films, stated that they envisioned the series, which had not yet been greenlit, as a limited series of approximately 13 episodes. By April 2014, there were indications that the series would be ordered straight to series, bypassing a pilot order, and would air between the late 2014 and early 2015 portions of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., if that series got a second season renewal. On May 8, 2014, ABC officially ordered the series for eight episodes, with executive producers Butters, Fazekas, Markus, McFeely, Dingess, Kevin Feige, Louis D'Esposito, Alan Fine, Joe Quesada, Stan Lee, and Jeph Loeb. The series was renewed for a second season on May 7, 2015, of 10 episodes.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, Duteurtre {{published}} the novel Gaieté parisienne, about the Paris gay community.

Drôle de temps, a series of six short stories published in 1997 received the Prix de l'Académie Française (French Academy award).

25|$|When the Great Plague of London {{closed the}} theatres in 1665, Dryden retreated to Wiltshire where he wrote Of Dramatick Poesie (1668), {{arguably the best}} of his unsystematic prefaces and essays. Dryden {{constantly}} defended his own literary practice, and Of Dramatick Poesie, the longest of his critical works, {{takes the form of a}} dialogue in which four characters—each based on a prominent contemporary, with Dryden himself as 'Neander'—debate the merits of classical, French and English drama. The greater part of his critical works introduce problems which he is eager to discuss, and show the work <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> of independent mind who feels strongly about his own ideas, ideas which demonstrate the breadth of his reading. He felt strongly about the relation of the poet to tradition and the creative process, and his best heroic play Aureng-zebe (1675) has a prologue which denounces the use of rhyme in serious drama. His play All for Love (1678) was written in blank verse, and was to immediately follow Aureng-Zebe. On 18 December 1679 he was attacked in Rose Alley near his home in Covent Garden by thugs hired by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, with whom he had a long-standing conflict.|$|E
25|$|Animal persons (usually {{mammals and}} birds, but {{including}} insects) appear {{to enjoy a}} relative autonomy which is lacking {{in the case of}} the animal 'co-essences'. Perhaps representing the transformed human beings of a former creation, they play varying social roles. In the Popol Vuh, for example, grandfather 'Great White Peccary' and grandmother 'Great White Coati' act as healers, whereas the owl messengers of the lords of the underworld wear military titles. Turning to the 'ceramic codex', one finds that animal persons are often clothed and acting like persons at court. The howler monkey, for example, is commonly depicted in the social role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> and sculptor, and functions as a divine patron of these arts. Other mammals function as musicians. In the Dresden Codex, certain animals (dog, jaguar, vulture, owl, parrot, frog), most of them clothed as human beings, are seated in between deities, and seem thus to be treated on a par with the latter, while other animals, again acting as human beings, fulfill important ritual roles. In the New Year rites, for example, an opossum traveller introduces the patron of the incoming year. Similarly, in the Paris Codex, a turkey person alternates with deities in offering the head of the lightning deity (god K) to the new king. Animal persons are repeatedly shown interacting with Goddess I.|$|E

He added that his friend John Philip Kemble thought this [...] "despised work" [...] was more characteristic of Shakespeare than any other known portrait.

500|$|The {{fantasy of}} She {{received}} particular acclaim from Victorian readers and critics. The review appearing in The Academy on 15 January {{was impressed by}} the [...] "grown-up" [...] vision of the novel, declaring [...] "the more impossible it gets the better Mr. Haggard does it... his astonishing imagination, and a certain vraisemblance [...] makes the most impossible adventures appear true". This sentiment was echoed in The Queen: The Lady's Newspaper, with the reviewer pronouncing that [...] "this is a tale in the hands <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> not so able as Mr. Haggard might easily have become absurd; but he has treated it with so much vividness and picturesque power as to invest it with unflagging interest, and given to the mystery a port of philosophic possibility that makes us quite willing to submit to the illusion.|$|E

It howls and stammers, but it also sings...Inarticulate and emotionally shut down, her massive body at once a prison and a hiding place, Precious is also perceptive and shrewd, possessed of talents visible only to those who bother to look. At its plainest and most persuasive, her story is that <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>writer</b> discovering a voice. 'These people talked like TV stations I didn't even watch,' she remarks of Ms. Rain and her lover (Kimberly Russell), displaying her awakening literary intelligence even as she marvels at the discovery of her ignorance." ...|$|E
