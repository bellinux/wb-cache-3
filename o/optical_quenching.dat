To measure the radioactivity in a liquid-scintillation experiment accurately, corrections must {{be made for the}} quenching present. A shift in the pulse-height spectrum of a beta-emitter causes a change in the integral counting efficiency of a liquid scintillation sample (I). By comparing the ratio of high and low-energy measurements with known amounts of quench, an index of counting efficiency can be made (2). Calibration curves obtained by this â€œchannelsratioâ€•method are independent of the quenching medium for â€˜Hand â€œC over most counting ranges (1, 3). Usually the counting efficiency is relatively constant within any set of experiments. However, variations among samples or the presence of colored pigments (such as carotene or bilirubin) may introduce substantial counting error. Thus, quench correction should be employed in every beta-scintillation experiment (2). We have found that the channel A/B ratios obtained from quench standards fall along a second-order polynomial curve described by the general formula ax 2 + bx + c = where x is the A/B ratio and y is the efficiency. Standard second-order polynomial regression may be carried out on channel A/B ratios found for standard samples, thus yield ing the coefficients for this polynomial.

The fluorescence intensity of ADC-NPs, synthesized via chemical precipitation, is found to have a strong inverse relationship with the DO concentration in aqueous solutions.

Excitons are therefore instrumental in understanding the photophysics of organic opto-electronic devices. The present work focused on describing the dynamics of spin-forbidden, long-lived triplet excitons in archetypal organic materials such as CBP. Triplet excitons lifetime and diffusion length are here estimated from modelling the results of triplet-triplet photoinduced absorption spectroscopy, steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements. The last two measurements are performed using a modified time-of-flight method, whereby the investigated material is adjacent to a phosphorescent sensing layer and optically excited from the opposite side. As {{the thickness of the}} material is increased, the variations of phosphorescence intensity coming from the sensing layer is correlated to the exciton diffusion parameters. We show that for fluorescent materials such as CBP, the near-field component of this emission couples to guided modes supported by the structure and directly excites the sensitizer – here Ir(ppy) 3 doped into CBP – which lead to an overestimation of the diffusion length.

Their distinct occurrence rates are pertinent to their formation-growth energetics and pinning effects at the disk edge. Based on these findings, we propose a paradigm of optical-quenching-assisted fast switching of vortex cores for the control of magnetic vortex based information recording and spintronic devices...|$|E
40|$|Available data: Complex {{refractive}} index of Indium Tin Oxide, [URL] Transparent conductive oxides (TCOs), {{such as the}} well-known indium-tin oxide, find widespread use in modern (nano) technological applications because of their unique combination of negligible optical absorption and good electric conductivity. We, however, show that despite the near-zero imaginary part of the {{refractive index}} {{that is responsible for}} the material’s transparency, TCOs drastically <b>quench</b> <b>optical</b> emitters when the emitter is within 10 nm from the TCO. Our results reveal that the pure near-field nature of this dissipation makes for an exquisite short-range optical ruler. Previous quenching-based optical rulers, based on interactions with plasmonic or graphene materials, have allowed measuring distances in the 20 – 100 nm range. Distances below 20 nm have, however, been hard to assess due to poor photon yields or weak absolute variations. We show that TCO-based rulers close this gap, allowing distance measurements with far-field optics in the 1 – 10 nm distance range with deep subnanometer sensitivity.

40|$|Conversion of F-​centers to F-​aggregate {{centers and}} the nature of the 255 nm-​band due to <b>optical</b> {{bleaching}} in <b>quenched</b> and x-​rayed NaBr crystals were studied at room temp. The decay of F-​centers along with the tail of the β-​band and the growth, satn., and annihilation of F-​aggregate centers in quenched crystals take place at earlier stages of bleaching than those in unquenched ones. The 255 nm-​band obsd. in both quenched and unquenched crystals was designated as the V 3 -​band following the F. Seitz (1954) model. A new band with a peak of 740 nm was detected during bleaching besides the 770 nm-​band, and these are designated as R 1 and R 2 -​band, resp. The halfwidth of the F-​band (HF) increases with respect to both bleaching time and quenching temp. The HF in quenched crystals cannot be measured during the later stages of bleaching as the bell-​shaped F-​band tends to be flat...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{waveguide}} {{studies have}} played {{an active role}} in the telecommunication industry. High doping concentrations are essential in the manufacture of short and compact <b>optical</b> amplifiers, yet <b>quenching</b> can reduce the performance of the amplifier. Sol-gel chemistry, combined with the dip-coating method is a means to develop rare-earth doped planar waveguides for such integrated optics components. The sol-gel process involves three main steps: first, a metal alkoxide (Si-alkoxide) in alcohol-based medium undergoes hydrolysis at a predetermined pH; the next step involves condensation, where Si-OH tetrahedra linkages occur and eventually result in an SiO 2 network. The third step involves solvent evaporation to eliminate residual organics and hydroxyl groups within the pores of the gel. This thesis reports on the luminescence properties of Eu 3 + and Tb 3 + within the SiO 2 -TiO 2 host prepared via the sol-gel method with both H 2 O and D 2 O hydrolyzed systems. Sol-gel synthesis and dip-coating methods were used to develop a planar waveguide for a 5 mol % europium sample in the aforementioned host...|$|R
