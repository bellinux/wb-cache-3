500|$|Head VI {{is closely}} {{modelled}} on Velázquez's c. 1650 Portrait of Innocent X, {{today in the}} Doria Pamphilj Gallery, Rome. Bacon cautiously avoided seeing the original, even when he spent three months in Rome in 1954. Critics speculate {{he was afraid of}} being disappointed, or thought that an intimate knowledge of the painting would dull his imagination. Yet his fascination was all-consuming, and he reproduced variants of it obsessively for almost two decadesan examination and homage described as [...] "without parallel in the history of art". Bacon's approach differs from Velázquez's in a number of ways: both artists were expressive, yet Bacon's broad brush-strokes and freedom with paint contrast with Velázquez's tight and controlled treatment. He adapts Velázquez's positioning of the pope to place him above the viewer's point of view, elevating and distancing him. This was already a common technique in commercial, promotional photography but in Bacon's hands, art historian Weiland Schmied argues, the angle places the pope <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of stage for the viewer to coldly observe.|$|E

2500|$|Between 1926 [...] and 1930, Schlick labored {{to finish}} Fragen der Ethik (Problems of Ethics), {{in which he}} {{surprised}} some of his fellow Circlists by including ethics as a viable branch of philosophy. In his 1932-33 contribution to Erkenntnis, [...] "Positivism and Realism", Schlick offered {{one of the most}} illuminating definitions of positivism as every view [...] "which denies the possibility of metaphysics" [...] (Schlick , p.260). Accordingly he defined metaphysics as the doctrine of “true being”, “thing in itself” or “transcendental being”, a doctrine which obviously [...] "presupposes that a non-true, lesser or apparent being stands opposed to it" [...] (Ibid). Therefore in this work he bases the positivism <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of epistemology which holds that the only true beings are givens or constituents of experience. Also during this time, the Vienna Circle published The Scientific View of the World: The Vienna Circle as a homage to Schlick.

[...] Yeston noted in a 1997 interview, [...] "My mother was trained in classical piano, and her father was a cantor in a synagogue. [...] A lot of musical theatre writers have something in common. Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Harold Arlen, Kurt Weill – each one had a cantor in the family.

[...] At age five, Yeston began taking piano lessons from his mother, and by age seven he had won an award for composition. [...] He attended the Yeshiva of Hudson County through grade eight. [...] Yeston's interest in musical theatre began at age ten when his mother took him to see My Fair Lady on Broadway. [...] At Jersey Academy, a small private high school in Jersey City, Yeston broadened his musical study beyond classical and religious music and Broadway show tunes to include jazz, folk, rock and roll, and early music.

2500|$|The {{southeast}} panel {{illustrates the}} opening ritual when the principal participant is elaborately dressed {{and is being}} handed a bundle of spears.

The principal participant is supine <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of a sofa. Two musicians are playing a turtle shell drum and clay rattles. A figure dressed as an eagle dances in front while a skeletal deity flies above and the death deity rises from liquid. The northwest panel shows the beginning of the ballgame.

Storey, Pierrots on the stage, p. 69. [...] Legrand was not above poking fun at himself—as he did in The Little Cendrillon (1857), a tale, as Storey puts it, [...] "of a white-faced Cinderfella", or in Le Grand Poucet (1858), the punning title of which alerted his audience to the ensuing self-mocking fun. [...] As his tenure at the Folies drew to a close, Legrand could even be said to have been teetering <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of pantomimic decadence. [...] Storey describes a piece from the last year before he left the theater:In Bridault's Les Folies-Nouvelles peintes par elles-mêmes [...] (1858), which announced the theater's reopening after summer renovations of the salle, the concierge of the establishment, one Père Pétrin, invokes the pantomimic muse of its stage. [...] It is she, he remarks, to whom the audience owes its entertainment, she who inspires its authors [...] "in the simple goal of molding the mind and the heart." [...] He cites as examples of such inspiration the maxims that conclude Pierrot millionnaire [...] and Le Petit Cendrillon: [...] "Money does not bring happiness!"

2500|$|Famously vituperative attacks {{came from}} {{journalist}} H. L.

He chastised the [...] "degraded nonsense which country preachers are ramming and hammering into yokel skulls". However, Mencken did enjoy certain aspects of Dayton, writing, [...] "The town, I confess, greatly surprised me. I expected to find a squalid Southern village, with darkies snoozing on the horse-blocks, pigs rooting under the houses and the inhabitants full of hookworm and malaria. What I found was a country town full of charm and even beauty—a somewhat smallish but nevertheless very attractive Westminster or Balair." [...] He described Rhea County as priding itself <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of tolerance or what he called [...] "lack of Christian heat", opposed to outside ideas but without hating those who held them. He pointed out, [...] "The Klan has never got a foothold here, though it rages everywhere else in Tennessee." [...] Mencken attempted to perpetrate a hoax, distributing flyers for the [...] "Rev. Elmer Chubb", but the claims that Chubb would drink poison and preach in lost languages were ignored as commonplace by the people of Dayton, and only the Commonweal bit. Mencken continued to attack Bryan, including in his famously withering obituary of Bryan, [...] "In Memoriam: W.J.B.", in which he charged Bryan with [...] "insincerity"—not for his religious beliefs but for the inconsistent and contradictory positions he took on a number of political questions during his career. Years later, Mencken did question whether dismissing Bryan [...] "as a quack pure and unadulterated" [...] was [...] "really just". Mencken's columns made the Dayton citizens irate and drew general fire from the Southern press. After Raulston ruled against the admission of scientific testimony, Mencken left Dayton, declaring in his last dispatch, [...] "All that remains of the great cause of the State of Tennessee against the infidel Scopes is the formal business of bumping off the defendant." [...] Consequently, the journalist missed Darrow's cross-examination of Bryan on Monday.|$|E
