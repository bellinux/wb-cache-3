The effect of outside corner angle (Ψ), inner radius (r) and shear friction (m) on the strain homogeneity was investigated. The strain homogeneity can be increased by correcting the outside corner to eliminate the corner gap between the sample and the die {{at the expense of}} average strain. Small inside <b>radius</b> and <b>outside</b> <b>corner</b> <b>radius</b> would provide large deformations without much loss in the strain homogeneity under frictionless conditions. The work piece deformation is by bending if the inner radius exceeds a critical value. No improvement in strain homogeneity was observed under frictional conditions...|$|R

40|$|As {{a vehicle}} travels through a corner, the flowfield {{observed}} from the vehicle׳s {{frame of reference}} becomes curved. This condition results in the relative flow angle and freestream velocity changing both across the width and {{along the length of}} the body. Wall-resolved Large Eddy Simulations were used to simulate a simple vehicle shape through three different <b>radii</b> <b>corners.</b> The variable flow angle and acceleration affected the pressure distribution along either side of the body and caused an increase in the size of the outboard C-pillar vortex, and an inboard decrease. Furthermore, an outboard extension of the separation bubble at the bluff trailing face resulted in a gentler downwash angle off the backlight surface, with the opposite occurring inboard. At a Reynolds number of 1. 7 × 106, a 19. 2 % increase in aerodynamic drag occurred for a five car-length <b>radius</b> <b>corner</b> when compared to the straight-line condition. In addition, a yawing moment acted against the rotation of the body through the corner, and a side force acted towards the centre of the corner.

In this work the effect of tooling parameters like die <b>corner</b> <b>radius</b> and punch <b>corner</b> <b>radius</b> on wrinkling and fracture limits are investigated using a finite element explicit solver LS-DYNA.
