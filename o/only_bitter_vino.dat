5000|$|Don Henley {{has since}} spoken out and insists that Felder is <b>only</b> <b>bitter</b> {{because he got}} kicked out and decided to write the tell-all, which he dismisses as a [...] "low cheap shot."

He denies this and says that the pair were {{responsible}} for the band's longevity success, because they did it their way.|$|R
50|$|There {{is also a}} {{myth that}} the {{cocktail}} was created at the hotel. The beverage, usually served in an eggcup, was given the name “couquetier” at the time. The alcoholic beverage is now a commonly purchased drink within the nightlife of the city. Moreover, an example the drink made at the St. Louis is the Crusta drink, which {{was made by the}} hotel manager Joseph Santini. His creation is said to have a more citrus-like taste compared to the traditional cocktail, which held a very bland taste due to it consisting of <b>only</b> <b>bitters,</b> sugars, and water.|$|R

Frenchy the Clown, the comic strips main character, was not <b>only</b> <b>bitter</b> and evil, {{but had a}} [...] "way with the ladies" [...] and was often depicted in fairly sexually explicit scenes. According to Bakays official website, he wrote these comics when he was [...] "ever so slightly embittered and pissed off at the world". It was humorous, and even pushed the envelope of National Lampoons lack of political correctness; the magazines lawyers refused publication of one panel in a subsequently published story.|$|R

50|$|The Indian Removal Act was controversial. Many Americans {{during this}} time favored its passage, {{but there was also}} {{significant}} opposition.

60|$|The men {{who keep}} {{the peace of the}} prairie are taught what heat and thirst are, when they ride in couples through a desolate waste wherein there is <b>only</b> <b>bitter</b> water, parched by pitiless sunrays and whitened by the {{intolerable}} dust of alkali. They also discover just how much cold the human frame can endure, when they lie down with only the stars above them, long leagues from the nearest outpost, in a trench scooped in the snow, and they know how near one may come to suffocation and yet live through the grass fires' blinding smoke. It happens now and then that two who have answered to the last roster in the icy darkness do not awaken when the lingering dawn breaks across the great white waste, and only the coyote knows their resting-place, but the watch and ward is kept, and the lonely settler dwells as safe in the wilderness as he would in an English town.|$|R

60|$|LORD WINDERMERE. [Standing C.] I {{sometimes}} {{wish you}} had. I {{should have been}} spared then the misery, the anxiety, the annoyance {{of the last six}} months. But rather than my wife should know--that the mother whom she was taught to consider as dead, the mother whom she has mourned as dead, is living--a divorced woman, going about under an assumed name, a bad woman preying upon life, as I know you now to be--rather than that, I was ready to supply you with money to pay bill after bill, extravagance after extravagance, to risk what occurred yesterday, the first quarrel I have ever had with my wife. You don't understand what that means to me. How could you? But I tell you that the <b>only</b> <b>bitter</b> words that ever came from those sweet lips of hers were on your account, and I hate to see you next her. You sully the innocence that is in her.

Because it imparts a luminous yellow-orange hue, it is used worldwide in everything from cheeses, confectioneries, and liquors to baked goods, curries, meat dishes, and soups.

6000|$|I {{listened to}} him with wonder; but that his sad {{demeanour}} and solemn utterance assured me of the truth and intensity of his feelings, I should with light derision have attempted to dissipate his fears. Whatever I was about to reply, was interrupted by the powerful emotions of Clara. Raymond had spoken, thoughtless of her presence, and she, poor child, heard with terror and faith the prophecy of his death. Her father was moved by her violent grief; he took {{her in his arms}} and soothed her, but his very soothings were solemn and fearful. [...] "Weep not, sweet child," [...] said he, [...] "the coming death of one you have hardly known. I may die, but in death I can never forget or desert my own Clara. In after sorrow or joy, believe that you father's spirit is near, to save or sympathize with you. Be proud of me, and cherish your infant remembrance of me. Thus, sweetest, I shall not appear to die. One thing you must promise,--not to speak to any one but your uncle, of the conversation you have just overheard. When I am gone, you will console your mother, and tell her that death was <b>only</b> <b>bitter</b> because it divided me from her; that my last thoughts will be spent on her. But while I live, promise not to betray me; promise, my child." ...|$|R

An instinctive feeling, soon after Dick Jones came in, led Fred to push his little bundle into the farthest corner, under the bed, far out of sight or inquiry; and the same reason led him to suppress all mention of his mother, and all the sacred part of his former life. He did this more studiously, because, having once accidentally remarked how his mother used to forbid him certain things, the well-educated Dick broke out,-- ...|$|R

60|$|My plan {{of action}} was soon formed, and {{procuring}} a stout cord I entered my wife's bedroom finding her, as I expected, in a sound sleep. Before she was awake, I had her bound fast, hand and foot. She was greatly surprised and pained, but heedless of her remonstrances, delivered in a high key, I carried her into the now rifled strong-room, which I had never suffered her to enter, and of whose treasures I had not apprised her. Seating her, still bound, in an angle of the wall, I passed {{the next two days}} and nights in conveying bricks and mortar to the spot, and {{on the morning of the}} third day had her securely walled in, from floor to ceiling. All this time I gave no further heed to her pleas for mercy than (on her assurance of non-resistance, which I am bound to say she honorably observed) to grant her the freedom of her limbs. The space allowed her was about four feet by six. As I inserted the last bricks of the top course, in contact with the ceiling of the strong-room, she bade me farewell with what I deemed the composure of despair, and I rested from my work, feeling that I had faithfully observed the traditions of an ancient and illustrious family. My <b>only</b> <b>bitter</b> reflection, so far as my own conduct was concerned, came of the consciousness that in the performance of my design I had labored; but this no living soul would ever know.|$|R

Indeed, Mr. George has a lofty way with him, which I don't see in other people; and, in reading books, I find he chooses the fine noble things always, and loves them {{in spite of}} all his satire. He {{certainly}} is of a satirical turn, but then he is <b>only</b> <b>bitter</b> against mean things and people. No gentleman hath a more tender heart I am sure; and but yesterday, after he had been talking so bitterly as you said, I happened to look out of window, and saw him stop and treat a whole crowd of little children to apples at the stall at the corner. And the day before yesterday, when he was coming and brought me the Moliere, he stopped and gave money to a beggar, and how charmingly, sure, he reads the French! I agree with him though about Tartuffe, though 'tis so wonderfully clever and lively, that a mere villain and hypocrite is a figure too mean to be made the chief of a great piece. Iago, Mr. George said, is near as great a villain; but then he is not the first character of the tragedy, which is Othello, with his noble weakness. But what fine ladies and gentlemen Moliere represents--so Mr. George thinks--and--but oh, I don't dare to repeat the verses after him." ...|$|R

Unexpectedly he had come upon a human being--a woman at that--who had made him disclose his will before its time. She should have his life.
