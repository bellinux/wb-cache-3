40|$|Abstract. Two ways {{to obtain}} {{nanosized}} silicon carbide (SiC) powders from {{the products of}} thermal decomposition of rice hulls and posterior thermal and chemical treatment of SiO 2 -C precursors are shown in the present paper. The reagents and products were analyzed using BET, DTA, IR, XRD and SEM/TEM. Precursors <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>rice</b> husks containing pure SiO 2 and a controlled SiO 2 -C ratio {{were used for the}} synthesis of SiC.

Nanosized dimensions of reagents <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>rice</b> husks and their high activity allow obtaining SiC in relatively milder thermal regimes. TEM and XRD analysis revealed synthesis of nanostructured mainly β-SiC with a mean crystallite size of 40 - 100 nm.

40|$|Abstract. The preparation, {{approximate}} composition, {{degree of}} hydrolysis (DH), lipase activity and antioxidant capacity (including the ability of scavenging DPPH and ABTS free radicals) were determined for various of aqueous enzymatic extract (AEE) <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>rice</b> bran (RB) using alcalase(A), trypsin(T), papain(Pn), neutrase(N) and protamex(Px). Peptides and γ-oryzanol are the major functional components of AEE. Generally, the protein yield varied {{with the type of}} enzyme used in the order of T>Pn>N>Px>A. Both trypsin and alcalase extracts exhibit a higher level of γ-oryzanol than other enzymes. Lipase activity was measured using the 4 -Nitrophenyl Laurate (p-NPL) substrate method, and significantly different (P< 0. 05) lipase activity values ranging from 0. 55 to 2. 38 mU/mL were observed from five hydrolysates. Furthermore, two synthetic free radicals were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of AEE. The alcalase extract (at 4. 35 ± 0. 15 mg protein/mL AEE) shows the greatest scavenging rate (28. 42 %) of DPPH, but trypsin extract has highest ABTS radical-scavenging activity of 94. 05 %. Data revealed trypsin was possible the most effective extractant under their optimal conditions. These results demonstrate that the product <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> <b>rice</b> bran by different enzymatic digestions may contain bioactive components and might potentially be natural antioxidants.
