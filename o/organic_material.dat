5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor communities {{are considered to be}} food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> produced in the euphotic zone, thousands of meters above. Most of the organic flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the euphotic zone), which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and downslope transport of <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> near continental margins.|$|E
5|$|The drift theory {{holds that}} the <b>organic</b> <b>{{material}}</b> did not form in or near its present location. Rather, it asserts that the material that would become a coal ball was transported from another location {{by means of a}} flood or a storm.|$|E

5|$|Vessels {{containing}} {{liquid nitrogen}} can condense oxygen from air. The liquid {{in such a}} vessel becomes increasingly enriched in oxygen (boiling point −183°C) as the nitrogen evaporates, and can cause violent oxidation of <b>organic</b> <b>material.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{marine and}} {{freshwater}} environments, gastrotrichs {{form part of}} the benthic community.

40|$|After deposition, solution-processed <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> are {{susceptible}} to redissolution by similar solvents. This solvent problem puts undesirable restrictions on the subsequent processing of electronic devices that contain <b>organic</b> <b>materials.</b> In particular, formation of multiple stacked layers is prohibited, as is the patterning of, or on, <b>organic</b> <b>materials.</b> Orthogonal processing utilizes chemically orthogonal fluorinated material systems to resolve these issues and open up previously unattainable processing routes. Four such processes are developed in this work, with one related to stacked devices and three related to patterning <b>organic</b> <b>materials.</b> More specifically, on one hand, a technique is developed to fabricate monolayers of conjugated polymer in stacked OLED devices. On the other hand, fluoropolymers are used to enable patterning of <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> with otherwise incompatible commercial (organic) photoresists, via roll-to-roll compatible inkjet printing and, finally, for high resolution studies with electron beam lithography. 2019 - 01 - 2...|$|R

40|$|Particle size {{distribution}} and {{the relation between}} the particle size and the amount of main components of Diesel exhaust aerosol were investigated. The amounts of the main components, i. e. elemental carbonand the sum of salts and <b>organic</b> <b>materials,</b> were determined thermo gravimetrically. The elemental carbon was separated from salts and <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> by means of stepwise heating. The salts were not separated from the <b>organic</b> <b>materials.</b> Sulfate ion was also analyzed by means of ion chromatography. The concentration of the total aerosol was 56 mg/m 3, that of the elemental carbon was 18 mg/m 3, and that of the sum of the salts and <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> was 16 mg/m 3. The elemental carbon was rich in the small particles and the small particles less than 0. 43 μm in　diameter　occupied about 50 wt％ of the elemental carbon.

40|$|Abstract. Elemental Analyzers and Infrared Spectrometer {{was used}} to {{study the effects of}} the {{different}} <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> on the structure and elemental composition of humus in black soil. The results showed as follow: Compared with control treatment (CK), application of <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> decreased aliphatic compounds of humic acid(HA) and fulvic acid(FA), and the role of plant residues was the most obvious. In humin linked to clay (HMc), all the <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> could increased aliphatic compounds, at the same time, decreased content of aryl-groups C＝C. After five years, used of <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> decreased content of hydroxyl and saccharide in humin linked to iron(HMi), but increased aliphatic compounds. Compared with CK, after five years, application of <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> resulted in significant decrease of C and H content, and the role of herb residues was the most obvious. Apart from animal excrement, others <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> significantly increased N content of HA, and there was significant differences among different treatments. Application of herb residues increased N of FA. The order of C content was: animal remnant>animal excrement>CK>woody residues>herb residues, and no significant differences were observed for this parameter among different treatments. Use of <b>organic</b> <b>materials</b> resulted in significant decrease of C and H, but enhanced O content of HMi, and the role of herb residues was the most obvious, at the same time, herb residues decreased N of HMi. After application of animal excrement and woody residues，the C and N content of HMc were enhanced, and H content of HMc was decreased.

5|$|Soil {{contains}} <b>organic</b> <b>material,</b> {{but because}} of the likelihood of contamination by humic acid of more recent origin, {{it is very difficult to}} get satisfactory radiocarbon dates.

5|$|Some anomalously old {{radiocarbon}} {{dates of}} Lake Cahuilla deposits {{may be the}} consequence of the Colorado River transporting ancient carbonates into the lake. In addition, discrepancies between shell and other <b>organic</b> <b>material</b> ages can reach 400–800 years owing to old carbon; shells can also absorb carbon-14 from the air. Other research has documented no substantial old carbon effects.|$|E

They are most often found growing in groups, though occasionally singly, on wood chips, rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, as well as in meadows, cultivated areas and woods. The foul odor of the gleba attracts insects that walk and feed on the spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.|$|E

Another study also showed that 90% of larvae matured into adults when the diet included nonviable eggs.
