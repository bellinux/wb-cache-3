40|$|Marine {{direction}} {{of foreign policy}} is for Russia one of key. It is determined geographical position of the Russian state banks of which is washed plenty of Maureies. Also it is related to that considerable part of population lives {{on the coast of}} Russian Maureies, and industry, located in an <b>off-shore</b> <b>bar</b> brings, in a large contribution to the economy. Many Russian marine travelers were the discoverers of «new» earths. The contribution of the Russian scientists to the hydrophysical, geological and biological study of Maureies and Oceans is great. Russia possesses a navy, to the constituents approximately one-third of total tonnage of world VMF and one of large in the world a rybopromyslovym fleet. Transport ships under the flag of Russian Federation it is possible to meet planets in the remotest corners. In a number of areas of military shipbuilding and civil shipbuilding Russia had and continues to save priority. Enhanceable interest to the Seas and Oceans found the reflection in the fundamental Russian documents, including, in the Marine doctrine of Russian Federation, ratified Russia President in 2015. In it the value of marine spaces for the Russian state is marked. In the Marine doctrine of Russian Federation is writtenin: «The skilled providing, marine teaching and education {{play an important role in}} the increase of efficiency of marine activity. They are directed on preparation, bringing in and maintainance of skilled shots of all levels, maintenance of professionalism, marine traditions and not indifferent relation of citizens to marine history of country, serve positive presentation, propaganda and support of national marine policy, to marine activity and marine service in society». Marine direction, marine science about regions found a reflection in the publications of row of the Russian authors, devoted research of policy of Russia in such regions, as: Black Sea region, Caspian region, Arctic, and also in the series of Encyclopaedias, devoted the Seas of Russia. </p...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, mineralogical and textural {{analyses}} of the sand-silt beach,deposits of Galveston. Island, Texas, are presented, with special emphasis on. heavy minerals. It is {{the intent of the}} author; 1) to describe the min. eralogical composition. of each of the heavy min. eral suites, an. d to test the significan. ce of variations foun. d among 4 of the more dominant heavy minerals (zircon, tourmaline, hornblende, and garnet); 2) to describe the size-distributions of the zircon and tourmaline present in. each heavy mineral suite; and 3) to postulate means or con. ditions by which any mineralogical or size-distribution. variations may be explained. The present study is concerned with the sand beach which circumscribes Galveston. Isla-nd. The island is composed of recent sandy and silty sediment and occupies a position at the mouth of Galveston. Bay some 50 miles south of Houston. Inasmuch as Galveston Island is essentially an over-sized <b>off-shore</b> <b>bar,</b> which, for the most part, separates the Gulf of Mexico from Galveston Bay, the beaches that rim the island consist of two contrasting sedimentary environments. A frontal beach environment occurs on. the Gulf side of the island, whereas a back-bay environ. ment exists on the bay side. The present thesis is largely concerned with the determination. of any consistent differen. ces, mineralogical or textural, which might exist between. the beach sands formed under these differing conditions. Galveston. Island extends in a NE - SW direction and is approximately 30 miles long. Samples were taken {{on both sides of the}} islan. d at roughly 5 -mile intervals. This sam. plin. g procedure made possible the grouping of samples in pairs, one from the front-beach and on. e from the back-beach, and. provided opportunity for a continuous check of variations as the laboratory work progressed. The sampling procedure and. sample grouping is explained. more thoroughly in the next section. This thesis is the third in a series concerned with the petrologic and lithologic properties of Gulf Coast sediments, the two previous being written by Powell (1957) and Dawson (1958) ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent {{work has}} {{revealed}} that desiccation processes can occur over elongated <b>off-shore</b> mud <b>bars</b> that form on Amazon-derived mud banks. Once mud cracks appear there, opportunistic mangroves, i. e. Avicennia germinans, commence the colonization process. Through the advantage of buoyancy of the mangrove propagules which can be trapped by the mud cracks, propagules can establish sometimes 1 - 2 kilometres offshore of the adult colonies. In a few months, these pioneer colonies become new sources of propagules, promoting rapid ecosystem expansion. Thus, mud cracking {{may be seen as}} an important factor in mangrove resilience. To investigate this phenomenon, a field experiment was conducted during the 2008 equinoctial spring tide in French Guiana in a study area located on the landward face of an elongated mud bar. A digital elevation model (DEM) was computed from DGPS and high-resolution laser station data. Meteorological data including air temperature and humidity, wind speed and orientation, rainfall, solar radiation, temperatures of the mud surface and at a depth of 30 -cm, were recorded. Additionally, the water content of the upper mud layer was monitored along a topographic transect. An installed camera took instant photographs every half hour. Preliminary results show that climatic conditions are not the main parameter controlling the desiccation process. Strengthening and consolidation of mud are mainly controlled by mud elevation (water loss by draining) and by the local tidal signal (determinant in spatial behaviour). The DEM enabled computation of the tidal frequency emersion signal, an important tool in analyzing the spatio-temporal patterns of mud cracking and mangrove colonization...|$|R
