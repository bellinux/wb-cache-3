40|$|The berries of European elder {{are used}} in {{traditional}} German medicine for various complaints. Due to insufficient research data, elderberry fruit was not monographed by the German Commission E {{at the end of}} the last century. A comprehensive review of the literature was conducted to summarize the pharmacological and clinical effects of elderberry fruit. Several databases and other sources were searched to identify in vitro and animal studies, and clinical trials investigating elderberry <b>fruit</b> <b>preparations.</b> For the latter, the level of evidence was evaluated as described previously. Elderberry <b>fruit</b> <b>preparations</b> may provide antioxidant, antiviral and antiproliferative effects in vitro. One animal experiment and one clinical trial were able to back the antioxidative impact in terms of a weak antilipidemic effect. Antibacterial and antiinflammatory effects seem possible, but need further support. In rats, an aqueous elderberry fruit extract produced central depression and analgesia and an ethanol fruit extract improved acetic acid-induced colitis. Several in vitro studies together with two exploratory studies in humans and one open study in chimpanzees indicate that the aqueous elderberry extract SambucolR may be useful for the treatment of viral influenza infections. These promising effects of elderberry <b>fruit</b> <b>preparations</b> from experimental and clinical studies should be backed by more rigorous studies before these preparations are recommended in the prevention of diseases and in treatment schedules...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} on aromatised fat-free stirred yoghurts and dealt with the influence of some thickeners andsweeteners on aroma compounds release and rheology. Thickeners (starch, pectin, locust bean gum and guar) and sweeteners (fructose, fructo-oligosaccahrides, aspartame andacesulfame) were added and mixed together in <b>fruit</b> <b>preparations,</b> which were then introduced in yoghurt. Different concentrationsof thickeners and sweeteners {{were used in the}} <b>fruit</b> <b>preparations</b> and were obtained with an experimental design. The headspacecomposition was assessed by solid-phase microextraction during shear conditions in a closed vessel. Rheological properties ofyoghurts were determined to obtain the flow behaviour index n and the consistency index K with the Ostwald law. The presence of pectin in yoghurts, tended to reduce the concentration of aroma compounds in the headspace of the samples. Weobserved also a significant decrease of aroma compounds in the headspace of yoghurt in the presence of starch. In the case of locustbean gum, a significant increase of flavour release was observed. Sweeteners and guar appeared to have no effect. We concluded thatrheological parameters did not explain the difference on aroma release and it seemed that during shear conditions, the compositionof <b>fruit</b> <b>preparations</b> showed a major role on aroma release. The influence of aroma compounds characteristics on the flavour releasewas observed, but experiments must be performed to highlight this observation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to gain insight into the effect of food {{formulation}} on aroma release and perception, both of which playing {{an important role in}} food appreciation. The quality and quantity of retronasal aroma released during food consumption affect the exposure time of olfactory receptors to aroma stimuli, which can influence nutritional and hedonic characteristics, as well as consumption behaviors. In yogurts, <b>fruit</b> <b>preparation</b> formulation can be a key factor to modulate aroma stimulation. In this context, the impact of size and hardness of fruit pieces in fat-free pear yogurts was studied. Proton Transfer Reaction-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-MS) was used to allow sensitive and on-line monitoring of volatile odorous compound release in the breath during consumption. In parallel, a trained panel used sensory profile and Temporal Dominance of Sensations (TDS) methods to characterize yogurt sensory properties and their dynamic changes during consumption. Results showed that the size of pear pieces had few effects on aroma release and perception of yogurts, whereas fruit hardness significantly influenced them. Despite the fact that yogurts presented short and similar residence times in the mouth, this study showed that <b>fruit</b> <b>preparation</b> could be an interesting formulation factor to enhance exposure time to stimuli and thus modify food consumption behaviors. These results could be taken into account to formulate new products that integrate both nutritional and sensory criteria...|$|R
