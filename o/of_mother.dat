The prevailing {{view in the}} literature is that <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> drug-dependent patients can be characterized by strong emotional bonds and overprotection. Studies suggest that maternal rejection could be a major risk factor of developing drug addiction. This work {{is a continuation of}} our previous study of childhood parenting experiences of substance-dependent patients. The aims were to compare the personality profile <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> substance-dependent patients and that <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> matched control subjects; and to examine the relation between the personality <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> addicts, and severity of their offspring’s addiction.

They had prospered there as a teaching order educating Slovak-speaking nuns and organized two Slovak schools. In 1926, under the leadership <b>of</b> <b>Mother</b> Mary Genevieve, the convent founded a day and boarding high school for girls—the Sacred Heart Academy. The academy outgrew its space and in 1929 the convent was expanded to accommodate rising enrollment. The annexed facilities reserved for the school included a Renaissance-style chapel, an auditorium, and a gymnasium. The Academy was later expanded to include the Jaeger Junior College.|$|E

The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling analysis. The results were as follows: Firstly, children’s representations <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> had a direct effect on peer competence. Secondly, peer competence had a direct effect on preschool adjustment. Thirdly, children’s representations <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> did not directly affect preschool adjustment, but their representations <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> did indirectly affect preschool adjustment, through peer competence. In conclusion, children’s representations <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> and peer competence influence preschool adjustment...|$|R

5|$|The Mother {{series is}} a {{role-playing}} video game series created by Shigesato Itoi for Nintendo. The series started in 1989 with the Japan-only release <b>of</b> <b>Mother,</b> which was followed up by Mother 2, released as EarthBound outside Japan, for the Super NES in 1994. A second sequel {{was released in}} Japan only, Mother 3, for the Game Boy Advance in 2006. The music of the Mother series includes the soundtracks to all three games; the first game was composed for by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka, who were joined by Hiroshi Kanazu for the second game, while Mother 3s score was written by Shogo Sakai.|$|E
5|$|The fandom also spun-out other enterprises. When Nintendo did {{not release}} a {{localized}} version <b>of</b> <b>Mother</b> 3, fans organized their own fan translation. The video game merchandising business Fangamer {{grew out of}} the Starmen.net community, and sells video game-related items online. A full-length documentary on Starmen.net and the fan community, EarthBound, USA, is in production. While series creator, Shigesato Itoi has stated that he is finished with the series, a fan-created sequel, Mother 4, began development. However, following several high-profile DMCA takedowns of other fan games, the fan-created game is undergoing rebranding so it will no longer be part of the Mother series.|$|E

He considered interstellar and interplanetary space travel instead of the confines of a single planet in the new game. After four months, Itoi scrapped the idea as cliché. Itoi sought to make a game that would appeal to populations that were playing games less, such as girls.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} and {{to compare}} the levels of secretory immunoglobulin A in samples of colostrum and milk <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> term and preterm neonates. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The levels of secretory immunoglobulin A <b>of</b> 10 <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> term neonates and 10 <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> preterm neonates were determined from 5 mL of colostrum or milk collected on the 1 st, 4 th, 10 th and 15 th days of the puerperal period, using the radial immunodifusion technique. We employed anamnesis, {{as well as physical}} and gynecological exams in women in the puerperal period. All the patients were attended at the Januário Cicco Maternity College. RESULTS: The secretory immunoglobulin A levels were significantly higher in the colostrum and milk <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> preterm neonates when compared with the levels found in colostrum and milk <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> term neonates (Mann-Whitney test, p< 0. 0001). There was a significant decline in the secretory immunoglobulin A levels of the colostrum and milk <b>of</b> the <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> term and preterm neonates during the four periods (Kruskal-Wallis test, p< 00001). CONCLUSIONS: The secretory immunoglobulin A levels in colostrum and milk <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> preterm neonates were significantly higher than in the <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> term neonates, demonstrating immunological adaptation in preterm neonate breast-feeding...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{determine}} whether the apparent additional and exceptional stresses associated with bearing and parenting twins affect the emotional wellbeing <b>of</b> <b>mothers.</b> SETTING [...] Great Britain, 1970 - 5. DESIGN Cohort study of 13, 135 children born between 4 April and 11 April 1970. <b>Mothers</b> <b>of</b> all children, both singletons and twins, were interviewed by health visitors (providing demographic data) and completed a self report measure of emotional well-being (the Rutter malaise inventory) when the child was 5 years of age. The malaise scores <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> twins were compared with those <b>of</b> all <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> singletons and then with those <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> categorised by the age spacing of their children (only one child, widely spaced, or closely spaced), taking account of maternal age, social class, and whether the study child had a disability, by using logistic regression. SUBJECTS 139 <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> twins [...] 122 pairs of twins and 17 twins whose cotwin had died [...] and 12, 573 controls, who were <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> singletons. RESULTS A significantly higher proportion <b>of</b> <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> twins at 5 years had malaise scores indicative <b>of</b> depression than <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> singletons at the same age. Mothers who had borne twins, one of whom had subsequently died, had the highest malaise scores and were {{three times more likely}} than <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> singletons to experience depression. Both <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> twin pairs and <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> singletons closely spaced in age were at significantly higher risk of experiencing depression than <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> children widely spaced in age or <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> only one child (p less than 0. 0001). Odds ratios indicated that the risk <b>of</b> depression in <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> twins was higher than that in <b>mothers</b> <b>of</b> closely spaced singletons.
