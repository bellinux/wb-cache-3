50|$|The Hajigak deposit trends north-east-south-west {{for about}} 9 km and {{is made up}} of 16 {{separate}} ore bodies, each up to 3 km in length. The deposit can be divided up into three geographical parts, the western, central and eastern parts. In addition to the large ore bodies there is a substantial area of thin fragmental ore deposits in the form of four surficial deposits. The main hematitic ore is medium- to fine-grained and displays a variety of massive, banded and porous textures. It occurs in lenses and sheets, within the Awband Formation. The thickness of the lenses has been indicated by drilling to be up to 100m, while the depth of mineralisation is untested 180m below surface. There are two main ore groups: unoxidised primary ores and semi-oxidised ores. The primary ores occur below 100 m and consist of magnetite and pyrite, and up to 5% chalcopyrite and pyrrhotite. The <b>oxidised</b> <b>ores,</b> extending up to 130m below ground surface, consist mainly of magnetite, martite and hydrogoethite. Two other oxidised ore types, hydrogoethite/hematite/semi-martite and carbonate/semi-martite, occur sporadically in small amounts in the deposit. Alteration that {{may be related to the}} mineralising event has been observed within the host rocks, and includes sericitisation, silicification and carbonisation.|$|E

Recent {{studies have}} {{explored}} {{the capabilities of}} sulphur dioxide (SO 2), a reducing agent that shows great potential to enhance the leaching efficiency of cobalt from mixed Co-Cu oxidized ores. The research study reported in this dissertation was conducted to further explore the efficacy of SO 2 as a suitable reagent to improve the cobalt yield in solution from mixed Co-Cu <b>oxidised</b> <b>ores.</b> Four mixed Co-Cu <b>oxidised</b> <b>ores</b> were used in this study; namely, high cobalt ore (34 % Co), low cobalt ore with mica (4 % Co), low cobalt ore without mica (3 % Co) and high copper ore (0. 5 % Co). The mechanistic leaching pathways of cobalt from these ores with and without SO 2 were investigated and monitored using Ultra-Violet/Visible spectroscopy. Mineralogical studies of these ores {{was carried out by}} X - ray diffraction (XRD), X - ray fluorescence (XRF) and flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS).

The experimental work was carried out on a laboratory scale and highlights of results obtained are summarized as follows:  Although not much information pertaining to Co 2 + bearing minerals in mixed Co-Cu <b>oxidised</b> <b>ores</b> was derived from XRD results, two forms of heterogenite minerals (CoOOH- 2 H and CoOOH- 3 R), which bear cobalt as Co 3 + were noted in the low cobalt ores.  High percentage cobalt dissolutions (85 % to 95 %) were achieved when leaching mixed Co-Cu <b>oxidised</b> <b>ores</b> in the presence of SO 2.  UV/Visible spectroscopy confirmed concentrations of Co 3 + and Co 2 + before and after SO 2 treatment of mixed Co-Cu <b>oxidised</b> <b>ores.</b>  Percentage cobalt dissolutions improved by 10 % to 20 % in microwave irradiated mixed Co-Cu <b>oxidised</b> <b>ores</b>  The presence of iron and copper in leach solutions can limit the dissolution of cobalt from mixed Co-Cu <b>oxidised</b> <b>ores</b> to a certain extent...|$|E

(Extraction Metallurgy) The {{techniques}} for the flotation of mixed copper and cobalt bearing oxide ores using the sulphidization method {{in order to}} recover the oxidized copper and cobalt bearing minerals have been well documented by previous researchers.

40|$|This review {{has as its}} {{underlying}} premise the need to become proficient in delivering a suite of element or metal products from polymetallic ores to avoid the predicted exhaustion of key metals in demand in technological societies. Many technologies, proven or still to be developed, will assist in meeting {{the demands of the}} next generation for trace and rare metals, potentially including the broader application of biohydrometallurgy for the extraction of multiple metals from low-grade and complex ores.

Examples of the bioleaching of polymetallic mineral resources using different combinations of those technologies are described for polymetallic sulfide concentrates, low-grade sulfide and <b>oxidised</b> <b>ores.</b> Three areas for further research are: (i) the development of sophisticated continuous vat bioreactors with additional controls; (ii) in situ and in stope bioleaching and the need to solve problems associated with microbial activity in that scenario; and (iii) the exploitation of sulfur-oxidising microorganisms that, under specific anaerobic leaching conditions, reduce and solubilise refractory iron(III) or manganese(IV) compounds containing multiple elements.

After the sample and the balls were loaded to the ball mill, it was run for seven different time intervals (½, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15 and 30 minutes). The short time (½ minute) provided data more closely related to the Breakage Function (B) since less secondary breakage was hypothesised. The data collected was used to determine some of the selection (S) and B Function parameters. The remaining parameters were estimated using a population balance model simulator that seeks the best combination of these parameters in order to minimize the residual error between the experimental and predicted product size distributions (PSDs).

40|$|The species adsorbed on Cu sulfide ore {{minerals}} from alkaline or near neutral solutions of blends of the flotation collectors dibutyl dithiophosphate (BDTP) and 2 -mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT) {{have been}} established by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Adsorption on air-exposed Cu metal, cuprite, chalcocite, covellite, chalcopyrite and pyrite was investigated from relatively high concentration solutions to simulate processing of variably <b>oxidised</b> <b>ores</b> or slug addition of collector under plant conditions, {{as well as from}} solutions of lower concentration. For air-exposed Cu metal, it was found that for a typical BDTP-MBT blend in which di-n-butyl DTP predominated, negligible BDTP was adsorbed at high concentration unless the pH was below 7. By contrast, at low concentrations but under non-starvation conditions, BDTP adsorption predominated even in the alkaline pH range. Both BDTP and MBT species were adsorbed following sequential conditioning in the two collectors. The dithiolate (MBT) 2 was not adsorbed from high concentrations of the blend, whereas it was adsorbed from similar concentrations of MBT collector alone. Most of the observed behaviour can be explained by collector solution species reactivity with Cu decreasing in the order MBT− > BDTP− > HMBT. There was no evidence to suggest any surface chemical synergism between the two collectors. For the minerals, competitive chemisorption broadly similar to that for Cu metal was observed, but the formation and adsorption of multilayer molecular CuBDTP or CuMBT was lower, and that of (MBT) 2 and HMBT was higher, when the surface availability of Cu was lower than at a native oxide layer. Open circuit potentials for Cu metal, chalcocite and covellite electrodes in 10 − 3 M solution of the collector blend were lower than for the corresponding values in MBT collector alone. For all concentrations in the alkaline pH range, surfaces conditioned in either BDTP alone or the blend were obviously hydrophobic, whereas surfaces conditioned in high concentrations of MBT were not obviously hydrophobic. Some surfaces conditioned sequentially in the two collectors, or in high concentrations of the blend at a pH below 7, were only moderately hydrophobic. Thus, depending on the collector concentration and pH, direct (albeit ex-situ) surface chemical characterisation established the adsorption of different species from a BDTP-MBT blend compared with sequential conditioning in the individual collectors, and hence potentially different hydrophobicities.

The gangue acid consumption was also measured to aid in understanding the behaviour of the gangue. The experimental results obtained were statistically analysed and modelled using the SEM procedure. The Structural Equation Models obtained showed that Cu and Co leaching yields had a strong positive dependence on both the leaching time and leaching temperature, while Fe leaching yield had a moderate dependence on the leaching temperature, stirring speed and the covariate Z (Z = stirring_speed*pH). On the contrary, Ni leaching yield had a strong negative dependence on both the stirring speed and the covariate Z. The Structural Equation Models agreed fairly with the experimental results obtained upon leaching.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 145 - 149. In the {{flotation}} of pyrite {{a minimum}} concentration of any ions {{is necessary to}} stabilize the froth and thus produce a reasonable recovery of pyrite. In the absence of ions a "dry froth" is formed which results in a decreased mass pull and thus a low pyrite recovery. The predominant effect of an. increased concentration of univalent ions was a decrease in ·the formation of "dry froth" during flotation which resulted {{in an increase in}} pyrite recovery. This was due to the increase in froth stability with the addition of ions and was verified in the two and three phase froth stability tests. The predominant effects of the divalent ions were: (i) an increase in froth stability resulting in increased pyrite recovery (ii) a sharp increase in grade due to a decrease in gangue recovery (iii) a decreased rate of flotation. The decrease in gangue recovery was possibly due to the effect of the ion on the compression of the electrical double layer resulting in coagulation of the quartz particles. The slow rate of flotation was ascribed to the slow rate of the ascent of the heavily mineralized bubbles. This increase in bubble mineralization could be due to coagulation of pyrite in the pulp phase. The adsorption of the collector, sodium ethyl xanthate, on pyrite was not affected by the univalent or divalent cations but decreased with the addition of the nitrate anion. However these variations in xanthate adsorption did not seem to {{have a significant effect on}} the flotation of pyrite. Flotation experiments using <b>oxidised</b> <b>ore</b> showed a reduced pyrite recovery compared with the leached ore.

40|$|The {{published}} mean δ 34 S {{values of}} ore-related pyrites from orogenic gold deposits of the Eastern Goldfields Province, Yilgarn Craton lie between − 4 ‰ and + 4 ‰. As for orogenic gold deposits worldwide, most deposits have positive means and a restricted range of δ 34 S values, but some have negative means and wider ranges of δ 34 S values. Wall-rock carbonation and back-mixing of similar-source fluids with different fluid pathways can {{explain some of}} the more negative δ 34 S signatures. However, structural setting appears {{to be the most important}} factor controlling ore-fluid oxidation state and hence the distribution of δ 34 S values in gold-related pyrites. Shear-hosted deposits appear to have experienced fluid-dominated processes such as phase separation, whereas stockwork, vein-hosted or disseminated deposits formed under conditions of greater rock buffering. At Victory-Defiance, in particular, negative δ 34 S values are more common in gently dipping dilational structures, compared to more compressional steeply dipping structures. It appears most likely that fluid-pressure fluctuations during fault-valve cycles establish different fluid-flow regimes in structures with different orientations. Rapid fluid-pressure fluctuations in dilational structures during seismic activity can cause partitioning of reduced gas phases from the ore fluid during extreme phase separation and hence are an effective method of ore-fluid oxidation, leading to large, local fluctuations in oxidation state. It is thus not necessary to invoke mixing with oxidised magmatic fluids to explain δ 34 S signatures indicative of oxidation. In any case, available, robust geochronology in the Eastern Goldfields Province does not support the direct involvement of oxidised magmatic fluids from adjacent granitic intrusions in orogenic gold genesis. Thus, negative mean δ 34 S values and large variations in δ 34 S values of ore-related pyrites in world-class orogenic gold deposits are interpreted to result from multiple mechanisms of gold precipitation from a single, ubiquitous ore fluid in varying structural settings, rather than from the involvement of <b>oxidised</b> <b>ore</b> fluids from a different source.

40|$|Includes bibliography. The {{exploitation}} of near-surface deposits {{has resulted in}} the need to adjust current conventional mineral processing technologies for the treatment of low grade <b>oxidised</b> PGM <b>ores.</b> The exposure of the ore to the atmosphere leads to the formation of an oxidation layer (consisting of base metal oxides) which inhibits the flotation process that requires a clean mineral surface to be effective.

Due to the corrosive nature of acid, such treatment would require additional equipment and a pre-wash. Therefore, this project investigates the use of ammonia as a pre-treatment of oxidised low grade PGM ores. Ammonia leaching has shown success in the extraction of base metals (94 % and 91 % Cu and Ni extraction) and is used as a wash reagent in an attempt to dissolve the oxidation layer and expose a cleaner mineral surface.

The predominant porphyry ore-type is blended with high grade skarn ores to optimize copper and gold feed grades to the concentrator. Current operation (2003) is to blend 80 % porphyry with 20 % skarn ores, {{resulting in an}} acceptable concentrate grade and recovery. However, when the proportion of skarn ore in the plant feed exceeds 20 %, low flotation recovery is often observed. Approximately 20 % of the copper and 30 % gold losses occur through the rougher flotation circuit. However, losses via the cleaner tailing stream are 8 % and 9 % for copper and gold, respectively, and augment value mineral losses to the final tailing. It may {{be noted that the}} cleaner tailing stream contains value minerals which have already been successfully floated in the rougher section of the concentrator, and are therefore recoverable. This study has the objective of determining the reasons for copper and gold loss in the cleaner tailing. The focus is therefore on the cleaner flotation bank and related streams. The project strategy commenced with characterization of the cleaner circuit performance under various operating conditions. This would provide evidence for any proposed mechanisms to explain the losses of valuable minerals to the cleaner tailing. The second part of the project strategy was to evaluate potential methods for improvement of cleaner flotation performance via laboratory flotation tests. To complete the work, plant trials of methods showing benefit in the laboratory were conducted. Characterisation surveys of the cleaner flotation bank were conducted as a function of ore blend, pulp and surface chemistry, mineralogy, flotation kinetics, particle size distribution, cleaner flotation cell hydrodynamic characterisation and residence time. These studies indicated that for greater than 20 % pyrite skarn in the concentrator feed blend, lower than expected gold and copper recoveries were achieved in the cleaner bank. Pulp and surface chemical analytical techniques indicated layers of oxide coatings existed on all particles, depressing flotation. Oxide coatings had also resulted in the copper activation of pyrite (CuS rimming), making separation from copper sulfides difficult. Losses included coarse composite particles, also suggesting possible liberation issues. However, liberated copper sulfides were also lost, supporting the notion of depression via oxide coatings. Residence time calculations for the cleaner flotation bank suggested that the flotation capacity was less than adequate, particularly at high mill throughput rates. Hydrodynamic characterisation indicated improvements in cell hydrodynamics were warranted. In contrast to the <b>oxidised</b> <b>ore</b> feed blend described above, when less than 20 % pyrite skarn was contained in the ore blend, high copper and gold recoveries were achieved in the cleaner bank. Laboratory tests suggested that increasing cleaner feed pH from 10. 5 to 11. 5, and 1 or collector addition to the cleaner feed, would result in improved cleaner flotation performance. These changes were trialed in the plant, with the pH adjustment being successful. High cleaner feed pH continues as a permanent modification to plant operating conditions...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{oxidation}} of sulfide minerals, such as {{that found}} in the regions of a sulfide ore body near the water table, can {{have a significant impact}} upon flotation. This theme has been explored for Merensky ore type sulfides where an ore containing pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite was thermally oxidised and the role of potential remedies investigated. Back-scattered scanning electron microscope images are presented showing the oxidation layer which formed in the mineral surfaces. These oxidation layers were depleted in both sulfur and iron with incorporated oxygen. Flotation recovery rapidly decreased with increasing oxidation, particularly after 27 days and reached a plateau after 50 days. Up to 27 days, this effect could be partially overcome with higher collector additions. Oxidation had more impact upon the finer size fractions, particularly for pyrrhotite. For more heavily surface oxidised samples, ultrasonic treatment prior to collector conditioning was found to improve flotation recoveries. This treatment had the greatest effect upon chalcopyrite particles. Sulfidisation was successful in restoring the flotation recovery of the heavily oxidised sulfide minerals. Longer sulfidisation conditioning times were not conducive to good flotation recoveries of both oxidised pyrrhotite and pentlandite due to oxidation of the freshly formed sulfide surfaces. For maximum flotation recoveries of oxidised pyrrhotite, pentlandite and chalcopyrite, different sulfidisation conditions are indicated. It appears likely that in a mineral processing operation treating <b>oxidised</b> Merensky type <b>ores,</b> two stages of sulfidisation employing different conditions would be required.

40|$|Bacterial {{leaching}} utilises bacteria, ubiquitous to sulphide mining environments to <b>oxidise</b> sulphide <b>ores.</b> The sulphide mineral chalcopyrite is {{the most}} common copper mineral in the world, comprising the bulk of the known copper reserves. Chalcopyrite is resistant to bacterial leaching and despite research over the last 20 - 30 years, has not yet been economically bioleached. Attempts have been made to use silver to catalyse the bacterial leaching of chalcopyrite since the early seventies. The majority of reported testwork had been performed on finely ground ore and concentrates in agitated batch reactors. This project used silver to catalyse the bioleaching of chalcopyrite in shake flasks, small columns and large columns. The catalytic effect was extensively studied and experimental parameters were varied to maximise copper recovery. Silver was also used to catalyse the ferric leaching of chalcopyrite at elevated temperatures. It was noted that the leaching performance of chalcopyrite in shake flasks compared to columns was markedly different. The specific differences between shake flasks and columns were qualified and separately tested to determine which parameter(s) affected the bioleaching of chalcopyrite. It was found that the ore to solution ratio, aeration, addition of carbon dioxide, solution distribution and small variations in the leaching temperature did not significantly effect the bioleaching of chalcopyrite ore in columns. The method of silver addition to columns did significantly affect the overall copper extraction. The ore in shake flasks was subjected to abrasion between ore particles and with the base of the flask. A test was designed to mimic the shake flask conditions, without the abrasion. The low abrasion test performed similarly to a column, operated with optimum silver addition. This indicated that the inherent equipment difference between shake flask and column operation largely accounted for the difference in leaching performance. Chalcopyrite ore was biologically leached in large columns. The ore crush size and other conditions were typical of those used in the field. The biological leach achieved 65 % copper extraction in 160 days. This level of copper extraction is significantly higher than any previously reported results (typically / 10 % copper extraction) and represents a significant advance in the bacterial leaching of chalcopyrite ore. Due to the inherent high temperature within underground stopes, it was decided to investigate the possibility of separating the leaching and the bacterial oxidation stages. The concept of separate bacterial and ferric leaching has been previously suggested, however the application to a stope, and heat exchange between the process streams was a novel approach. Large column ferric leaches at 70 oC illustrated the technical feasibility of this process. Copper extraction was rapid and high (70 % in 100 days of leaching), even when a reduced level of silver catalysis was used. After leaching in large columns, samples of ore were taken for analysis by optical mineralogy. The analysis gave valuable insights into the nature of reaction passivation on chalcopyrite ore. In particular, it was discovered that the precipitation of goethite was a major limiting factor in the bioleaching and ferric leaching of chalcopyrite in columns. In addition, reduced sulphide species were detected on the surface of residual chalcopyrite, giving an indication of the sequential nature of the chalcopyrite reaction chemistry. The bacterial population was characterised using DNA techniques developed during the project. Qualitative speciation was carried out and compared between the columns, down the columns and over time in a column. Comparison of these populations enabled greater mechanistic understanding of the role of bacteria in the leaching of chalcopyrite. This work was the most comprehensive attempt to date made to delineate the complex microbiological/mineral actions using analysis of population dynamics from a mixed inoculum. It was found that the iron oxidiser Thiobacillus ferrooxidans dominated within the columns and leach solutions. The sulphur oxidiser Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans was also prevalent in the columns, particularly during the period of rapid chalcopyrite oxidation. The high temperature, ferric leaching of chalcopyrite was unexpectedly poor {{in the first round of}} large columns. The reason for the low extraction was attributed to an increase in pH down the column, resulting in excessive goethite precipitation. The solution flowrate (velocity) was increased by ten times in subsequent columns. There were no operational problems (e. g. break-up of ore agglomerates). The increase in flowrate resulted in a high yield of copper. The kinetics of extraction were faster than a corresponding bacterial leach, confirming the potential advantage of a high temperature leach. The small column studies highlighted that it was important to get an even distribution of silver down the stope to enable maximum catalytic effect. If the ore were agglomerated, silver would be added with acid at that point. However, it may not always be possible to agglomerate the ore. For example, the process may be used in-situ on a fractured ore body, or on an ore that has a low fines content, and hence does not require agglomeration. Various complexing agents were tested for their ability to distribute silver at the start of the leach and to recover silver at the end of the leach. For instance when silver was complexed with thiourea and then trickled through the ore, an even distribution of silver was achieved. After leaching was completed, a thiourea wash recovered a significant amount of the silver. These two techniques minimised the amount of silver required and thus significantly added to the economic viability of the process. The success of the technical work has led to an evaluation of the process in the field. A flowsheet was developed for the high temperature, in-stope ferric leach of chalcopyrite. An economic analysis was performed that illustrated the process would be viable in certain situations. An engineering study considered issues such as acid consumption, aeration, silver distribution, silver recovery and a heat balance of the stope...|$|R
