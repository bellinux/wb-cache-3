In this study commercially manufactured high density fiberboard (HDF) based laminated samples were exposed to a sequence of 2 hrs, 24 hrs and 15 days water soaking test. Internal bond (IB) strength from 2 in by 2 in by 0. 25 in samples was determined at each exposure level. All of the failures took place in the core layer of the specimens. Based on initial results of this work IB strength of the samples reduced from an average value of 340 psi to 300 psi as a result of 2 -hr water exposure. When the samples were kept in water for 24 hrs and 15 days their IB strength reduction was not substantial.

In this study, the substantial improvement of dirt repellence of HPLs with simultaneous enhancement of its abrasion resistance was achieved {{for the first time}} by incorporating nonafluorohexyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (FH-POSS) nanoparticles (up to 1 % w/w) into a melamine formaldehyde (MF) resin matrix used to impregnate decorative and <b>overlay</b> <b>papers</b> required for HPLs production. FH-POSS particles were synthesized and thoroughly characterized by C- 13 and Si- 29 solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. Fluoroalkyl moieties in FH-POSS afforded increased hydrophobicity to HPLs thus providing improved surface clean ability, whereas abrasion resistance was improved due to the robust silica core of the POSS particles. Hydrophobicity of HPLs doped with FH-POSS increased with time, after resin curing, and this was attributed to migration of FH-POSS nanoparticles to the composite surface. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Mass-customization is a {{megatrend}} {{that also}} affects the wood industry. To obtain individually designed laminates in batch size one efficient printing and processing technologies are required. Digital printing was envisaged {{as it does}} not depend on highly costly printing cylinders (as used in rotogravure printing) and allows rapid exchange of the printing designs. In the present work, two wellestablished digital printing approaches, the multi-pass and the single-pass technique, were investigated and evaluated for their applicability in decorating engineered wood and low-pressure melamine films. Three different possibilities of implementing digital printing in the decorative laminates manufacturing process were studied: (1) digital printing on coated chipboard and subsequently applying a lacquered top-coat or melamine overlay (designated as “direct printing”, since the LPM was the printing substrate), (2) digital printing on decorative paper which was subsequently impregnated before hot pressing (designated as “indirect printing, variant A”) and (3) digital printing on decorative paper with subsequent interlamination of the paper between impregnated under- and <b>overlay</b> <b>paper</b> layers during the pressing process (designated as “indirect printing, variant B”). Due to various advantages of the resulting cured melamine resin surfaces including a much better technological performance and flexibility in surface texture design, it was decided to industrially further pursue only the indirect digital printing process comprising interlamination and the direct printing process with a melamine overlay-finishing. Basis for the successful trials on production and laboratory scales were the identification of applicable inks (in terms of compatibility with melamine resin) and of appropriate printing paper quality (in terms of impregnation and imprinting ability). After selection and fine tuning of suitable materials, the next challenge to overcome was the initially insufficient bond strength between impregnated overlay and the ink layers which led to unsatisfactory quality of the print appearance and delamination effects. However, the optimization of the pressing program {{and the development of a}} modified impregnation procedure for the underlay and overlay papers allowed the successful implementation of digital printing in the production line of our industrial partner FunderMax...|$|E

This 'electric textbook' was placed above the teaching aid and the responder marked the answers by penetrating the page with a stylus (signalling probe) which contacted the backing member to complete an electrical circuit indicating the correctness of the answer selected; a light immediately showed the result - green for right, and red for the wrong answer. The backing member underlying the textbook page had an electronically conductive pattern which permitted wide latitude in {{the format of the}} page or sheet containing the questions without allowing the student to guess which answers were correct by virtue of their position on the page. It was the first corrector of its kind to combine questions on the <b>overlaying</b> <b>paper</b> with immediate responses and feedback, obviating the requirement for referral to corresponding separate reference sheets, and the construction of the circuit board was such that it permitted the format of the multiple question sheet to be randomised within large limits so as to avoid visual the repetition and monotony associated with previous correctors, not only from page to page or sheet to sheet, but within any individual sheet itself, thus allowing for a plurality of possible answers.
