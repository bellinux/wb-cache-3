5|$|With 10seconds {{left to go}} {{in round}} two, Tszyu landed a right hand clean on Judah's chin and he backed away from Tszyu with his hands down. Tszyu went after Judah, {{throwing}} another right hand that landed <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> and sent Judah crashing to the canvas. Judah jumped up instinctively and tried to signal that he was fine to referee Jay Nady, but was still dazed by the punch and fell down a second time. When Judah collapsed, Nady waved the fight over, resulting in a technical knockout victory for Tsyzu and Judah's first professional loss.|$|E
5|$|On April 23, 2003, in {{the lead}} up to the 2003 Indy 500, Andretti took to the track {{for the first time}} in ten years in a major open wheel car at the age of 63. He participated in a test session for son Michael's AGR IndyCar team. One of the team's regular drivers, Tony Kanaan, {{suffered}} a radial fracture of his arm a week earlier in an April 15 crash at Motegi. If Kanaan was not cleared to drive in enough time, tentative plans were being prepared for Andretti to qualify the car for him. He would turn the car over to Kanaan on race day, though no plans had been made for Andretti to actually drive in the race. During the test, Andretti ran at competitive speeds, but running over debris saw his car becoming airborne and the attempt ended with a spectacular crash. Andretti was able to walk away from the wreck with just a minor cut <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin.</b> This was Andretti's last significant on-track activity at Indianapolis.|$|E
25|$|On 7 April 2008, it was {{announced}} that Čech had undergone emergency surgery <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> and lips following an accidental collision with Tal Ben Haim during training. He had 50 stitches put on his mouth and chin and missed 22 games due to injuries. He returned to action on 14 April, in a home match against Wigan Athletic which Chelsea drew 1–1. He appeared in the Champions League final against Manchester United, where Chelsea lost in a penalty shootout.|$|E

60|$|Uncle Ben, who had {{hitherto}} always exercised {{a severe}} restraint--partly from respect and partly from caution--over his long limbs in the school-house, here slowly lifted one leg over another bench, and sat himself astride of it, leaning forward <b>on</b> <b>his</b> elbow, <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> resting between <b>his</b> hands.|$|R
60|$|Walters, at gaze in the doorway, {{listened to}} the bitter tirade. Wilding, on the settle, sat silent a moment, <b>his</b> elbows <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knees, <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> in <b>his</b> hands, his eyes set and grim as Trenchard's own. Then he {{mastered}} himself, and waved a hand towards the table where stood food and wine.|$|R
25|$|Acuff {{was born}} on September 15, 1903 in Maynardville, Tennessee to Ida (née Carr) and Simon E. Neill Acuff, the third of their five children. The Acuffs were a fairly {{prominent}} family in Union County. Roy's paternal grandfather, Coram Acuff, had been a Tennessee state senator, and Roy's maternal grandfather was a local physician. Roy's father was an accomplished fiddler and a Baptist preacher, his mother was proficient on the piano, and during Roy's early years the Acuff house was a popular place for local gatherings. At such gatherings, Roy would often amuse people by balancing farm tools <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin.</b> He also learned to play the harmonica and jaw harp at a young age.|$|E
25|$|On 1 March 2012, the {{advocate}} depute led evidence from Sgt Paul Grainger of Lothian and Borders Police. He {{spoke to the}} contents of an 11-hour interview which Mr Gilroy gave to police on 6 May 2010. Sgt Grainger told the court that during the interview he noticed a scar on Mr Gilroy's forehead under his hairline and {{that there had been}} some sort of scratch <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin.</b> The court also heard that Gilroy had told police, that on the evening of 2 May 2010 he and Suzanne Pilley had decided to split up and then took part in a Buddhist-style religious ceremony, writing their feelings down on pieces of paper and burning them.|$|E
25|$|Jeffreys {{was born}} into a middle-class family in Oxford, where he spent the first six years of his life until 1956, when the family moved to Luton, Bedfordshire. He {{attributes}} his curiosity and inventiveness to having been gained from his father, as well as his paternal grandfather, who held a number of patents. When he was eight, his father gave him a chemistry set, which he enhanced {{over the next few years}} with extra chemicals, even including a small bottle of sulfuric acid. He says he liked making small explosions, but an accidental splash of the sulfuric acid caused a burn, which left a permanent scar <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> (now under his beard). His father also bought him a Victorian-era brass microscope, which he used to examine biological specimens. At about 12, he made a small dissecting kit (including a scalpel, crafted from a flattened pin) which he used to dissect a bumblebee, but he got into trouble with his parents when he progressed to dissecting a larger specimen. One Sunday morning he found a dead cat on the road while doing his paper round and took it home in his bag. He relates that he started to dissect it on the dining room table before Sunday lunch, causing a foul smell throughout the house after he ruptured its intestines.|$|E
60|$|He {{came into}} the kitchen, and sat down with <b>his</b> hat <b>on,</b> and, taking <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> between <b>his</b> fingers, moved uneasily about <b>on</b> <b>his</b> chair.|$|R
60|$|He {{had spoken}} thus at great length, but with {{extraordinary}} restraint. Never once did he raise his voice or indulge in gesture. He spoke in even, monotonous tones, like {{one who is}} reciting a lesson; and he sat straight {{in front of the}} fire, <b>his</b> elbow <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knee, <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> resting in <b>his</b> hand and his eyes fixed upon the flames.|$|R
60|$|He lingered {{as long as}} he dared, {{longing to}} go forward to greet her, but he went slowly out at last, home to his {{boarding}} place and sat down in his habitual attitude when in deep thought, <b>his</b> elbow <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knee, <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> in <b>his</b> palm. He wanted to see her, he must see her and tell her how much she had done for him.|$|R
500|$|He {{was quite}} a sight when he {{returned}} to his comrades, as his uniform was covered in mud, he had blood running down his face, and had five days' stubble <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin.</b> He was also festooned [...] "like a Christmas tree" [...] with souvenired German binoculars and pistols. Full of nervous tension, he chattered to his mates about how he had [...] "put the wind up" [...] the Germans. During the Battle of Mont Saint-Quentin, the 43rd Battalion suffered 67 casualties. In the next week, the 11th Brigade was part of the pursuit of the Germans to the main Hindenburg Line. On 10 September, Weathers was promoted to temporary corporal. On 29 September, the 3rd Division was part of the Battle of St Quentin Canal, and the 43rd Battalion was sheltering in a trench when a shell burst among a small group of men, wounding Weathers in the head. He died soon after, without knowing he would receive the Victoria Cross, which was gazetted on 24 December 1918. The same shell killed his uncle, Lance Corporal J. J. Weathers. Lawrence Weathers was buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission Unicorn Cemetery, Vendhuile. He was survived by his wife and sons. , his Victoria Cross was {{in the hands of a}} private collector.|$|E
500|$|The 1953 {{season began}} with a 27–0 win over the Green Bay Packers in which Graham passed for 292yards and ran for two touchdowns. It {{was the first of}} 11 {{straight}} victories for the Browns, whose only loss came in the final game of the season to the Philadelphia Eagles. Near {{the end of the season}} in a game against the 49ers, Graham took a forearm to the face from Art Michalik that opened a gash <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> requiring 15 stitches. Graham's helmet was fitted with a clear plastic face mask, and he came back into the game; the injury helped inspire the development of the modern face mask. Despite an 11–1 record, Cleveland lost in the championship game for the third year in a row, falling to the Detroit Lions 17–16. Two of Graham's passes were intercepted. He said after the game that he wanted to [...] "jump off a building" [...] for letting his teammates down. [...] "I was the main factor in losing", he said. [...] "If I had played my usual game, we would have won." [...] Still, Graham finished the season as the NFL's leading passer and again won the Most Valuable Player award.|$|E
2500|$|The {{folk song}} {{mentioned}} above {{has a few}} particulars on his physical appearance; he was described as [...] "rather old," [...] two of his fingers were crooked, {{and he had a}} long scar <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin.</b>|$|E
60|$|Seated on a chair, with <b>his</b> elbows <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knees, <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> in <b>his</b> hands, and {{his nails}} between his teeth, {{he stared at}} {{a corner of the}} room, nibbled and meditated. There was nothing {{peculiar}} about {{the corner of the room}} at which he stared, save that there stood in it a portmanteau which Sam had bought the day before, and in which were locked his and Robin's bags of treasure.|$|R
60|$|There {{was silence}} after that, for many a {{heart was beating}} spasmodically with fear or with hope. My lord Hortensius Martius sat on a low stool, with <b>his</b> elbow <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knee, <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> buried in <b>his</b> hand. His eyes, glowing with dull and sullen hatred, searched the face of Dea Flavia, trying to read what went on behind the pure, {{straight}} brow and those liquid blue eyes, deep as the fathomless sea.|$|R

2500|$|On September 7, 2008, Romo led the Cowboys to a 28–10 {{win over}} the Cleveland Browns in their season opener. Romo {{completed}} 24 of his 32 passes {{for a total of}} 320 yards and one touchdown. [...] After the game, Romo required 13 stitches for a large gash <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> that occurred during the third quarter when linebacker Willie McGinest hit him in the chin with his helmet. The NFL fined McGinest $7,500 for the hit.|$|E
2500|$|The Tollund Man lay [...] {{away from}} firm ground, buried under {{approximately}} [...] of peat, his body {{arranged in a}} fetal position. He wore a pointed skin cap made of sheepskin and wool, fastened securely under his chin by a hide thong. There was a smooth hide belt around his waist. Additionally, the corpse had a noose made of plaited animal hide drawn tight around the neck and trailing down his back. Other than these, the body was naked. His hair was cropped so short as to be almost entirely hidden by his cap. There was short stubble (1mm length) <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> and upper lip, suggesting {{that he had not}} shaved on the day of his death.|$|E
2500|$|This is {{generally}} done {{by using a}} physical representation of a trader's intentions with his hands. [...] If a trader wants to buy ten contracts at a price of eight, for example, in the pit he would yell [...] "8 for 10", stating price before quantity, and turn his palm inward toward his face, putting his index finger to his forehead denoting ten; {{if he were to}} be buying one, he would place his index finger <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin.</b> [...] If the trader wants to sell five contracts at a price of eight, they would yell [...] "5 at 8", stating quantity before price, and show one hand with palm facing outward, showing 5 fingers. [...] The combination of hand-signals and vocal representation between the way a trader expresses bids and offers is a protection against misinterpretation by other market participants. For historical purposes, an illustrated project to record the hand signal language used in CBOT's trading pits has been compiled and published.|$|E
60|$|The {{man turned}} slowly his bloated and sodden face of many colours bristling with white hairs. His little red eyes glistened with moisture. His big lips had a violet tint. They {{remained}} closed. With the dirty {{back of his}} whip-hand he rubbed the stubble sprouting <b>on</b> <b>his</b> enormous <b>chin.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{opened the}} door for her with an old-world politeness which disuse had {{rendered}} a little rusty: then, with an air of getting back to business after a pleasant but frivolous interlude, he took up the paper-weights once more and placed the ruler with nice care <b>on</b> <b>his</b> upturned <b>chin.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The third film, 1989's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, set in 1938, {{returned}} to the formula of the original, reintroducing characters such as Sallah and Marcus Brody, a scene from Professor Jones's classroom (he now teaches at Barnett College), the globe trotting element of multiple locations, {{and the return of}} the infamous Nazi mystics, this time trying to find the Holy Grail. The film's introduction, set in 1912, provided some back story to the character, specifically the origin of his fear of snakes, his use of a bullwhip, the scar <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin,</b> and his hat; the film's epilogue also reveals that [...] "Indiana" [...] is not Jones's first name, but a nickname he took from the family dog. The film was a buddy movie of sorts, teaming Jones with his father, often to comical effect. Although Lucas intended to make five Indiana Jones films, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was the last for over eighteen years, as he could not think of a good plot element to drive the next installment.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs, Gilmour {{broke the}} team scoring record by scoring 35 points as Toronto reached the Campbell Conference Final. The sixth {{game of the}} series, against the Los Angeles Kings, ended in controversy. Toronto led the series three games to two and one {{additional}} victory would have put the Maple Leafs into the Stanley Cup Final {{for the first time}} since 1967. In the first minute of overtime with the score tied 4–4, Gilmour was cut <b>on</b> <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> for eight stitches after he was struck by Wayne Gretzky's stick. League rules of the time mandated that player who caused an injury via a high-sticking infraction be assessed a five-minute penalty, however referee Kerry Fraser made no call on the play, even after conferring with his linesmen. [...] Instead, Gretzky remained on the ice and scored the game-winning goal seconds later. Gretzky then led Los Angeles to a game seven victory that eliminated Toronto from the playoffs. Toronto fans remain bitter about the non-call two decades after the fact, while Fraser – who explained he did not have a clear view of the play – admitted it was the worst mistake he made in over 2,100 games as an NHL referee.|$|E

60|$|Here {{they faced}} Captain Carg, whom Patsy {{afterward}} declared was the tallest, thinnest, chilliest {{man she had}} ever encountered. His hair was grizzled and hung low <b>on</b> <b>his</b> neck; <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> was very long and ended in a point; his nose was broad, with sensitive nostrils that marked every breath he drew. As for his eyes, which instantly attracted attention, they were brown and gentle as a girl's but had that retrospective expression that suggests far-away thoughts or an utter {{lack of interest in}} one's surroundings. They never looked at but through one. The effect of Carg's eyes was distinctly disconcerting.|$|R
60|$|Recollections {{came across}} Arthur, {{and he turned}} away his head, self-convicted of having thought the women made a tedious history, {{and that he could}} not be bored by attending. Percy's way of listening, meanwhile, was with <b>his</b> foot <b>on</b> the fender, <b>his</b> elbow <b>on</b> <b>his</b> knee, <b>his</b> <b>chin</b> resting <b>on</b> <b>his</b> hand, his bright gray eyes fixed full on Violet, with a beaming look of gladness, and now and then a nod of assent, as if no heroism on Theodora's part could surpass his expectations, for he could have told it all beforehand. However, his turn came, when Violet {{described}} her last expedition after the chess-board, and the injury it had entailed.|$|R
