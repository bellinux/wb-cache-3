5|$|At one point, {{most of the}} Native Alaskans in {{the film}} went on strike. They were paid $5 per day for being extras, {{participating}} in hunts or tribal ceremonies, or for acting in minor roles. Although this was a large sum for Alaska at the time, many decided to strike for $10 or $15 a day. Van Dyke immediately hired strikebreakers from among the <b>other</b> <b>native</b> people as replacements, and the strike ended.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the Rare Breeds Survival Trust {{was set up in}} the 1970s, the Shetland had become rare, and it was listed by them as Category 2 (Endangered). Since then, the breed has become popular with smallholders, and it is now {{classified}} as Category 6 (<b>Other</b> <b>native</b> breeds), with a UK population of over 3000. On the mainland the breed is governed by the Shetland Sheep Society.|$|E

Unworked obsidian was carried by the Mono Paiutes over passes in the Sierra Nevada to trade with <b>other</b> <b>Native</b> American groups. Chips of Mono–Inyo obsidian can still be found at many ancient mountain campsites.|$|E

5|$|The fifty U.S. {{states have}} taken their names {{from a wide variety}} of languages. The names of 24 states derive from {{indigenous}} languages of the Americas and one from Hawaiian: eight come from Algonquian languages, seven from Siouan languages (one of those by way of Illinois, an Algonquian language), three from Iroquoian languages, one from a Uto-Aztecan language, and five from <b>other</b> <b>Native</b> American languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of bull trout and <b>other</b> <b>native</b> {{species of fish}} in Banff's lakes has also dwindled, {{with the introduction of}} non-native species including brook trout, and rainbow trout. Lake trout, westslope cutthroat trout, and Chiselmouth are rare native species, while chinook salmon, White sturgeon, Pacific lamprey, and Banff longnose dace are likely extirpated locally. The Banff longnose dace, once only found in Banff, is now an extinct species.|$|E

5000|$|In Malaysia, {{the early}} colonial censuses listed {{separate}} ethnic groups, such as [...] "Malays, Boyanese, Achinese, Javanese, Bugis, Manilamen (Filipino) and Siamese". The 1891 census merged these ethnic groups into the three racial categories used in modern Malaysia—Chinese, ‘Tamils and <b>other</b> <b>natives</b> of India’, and ‘Malays and <b>other</b> <b>Natives</b> of the Archipelago’. This {{was based upon}} the European view {{at the time that}} race was a biologically based scientific category. For the 1901 census, the government advised the word [...] "race" [...] should replace [...] "nationality" [...] wherever it occurs.|$|R
5|$|Before European {{settlement}} of North America, Minnesota was populated by a subculture of Sioux called the Dakota people. As Europeans settled the east coast, Native Americans {{moved away from}} them causing migration of the Anishinaabe (also known as Ojibwe) and <b>other</b> <b>Native</b> Americans into the Minnesota area. The first Europeans in the area were French voyageur fur traders who arrived in the 17th century and began using the Grand Portage to access trapping and trading areas further inland. Late that century, Anishinaabe migrated westward to Minnesota, causing tensions with the Dakota people. Explorers such as Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, Father Louis Hennepin, Jonathan Carver, Henry Schoolcraft, and Joseph Nicollet mapped out the state.|$|E

It was recorded as being cultivated {{in the garden}} of Karl von Hügel in Vienna, Austria in 1831, and in 1833 it was listed amongst the rare plants that had been introduced into Belgium. Along with several hundred <b>other</b> <b>native</b> Australian plants it was exhibited at plant shows held at Utrecht and Haarlem in the Netherlands in the 1840s and 1850s. By this time, however, English gardeners had already begun to lose interest in the Proteaceae, {{and by the end of}} the 19th century European interest in the cultivation of Proteaceae was virtually non-existent.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, the Sauk and Meskwaki (or Fox) Native American tribes lived {{along the}} Mississippi River {{in what is}} now the U.S. states of Illinois and Iowa. The two tribes had become closely {{connected}} after having been displaced from the Great Lakes region in conflicts with New France and <b>other</b> <b>Native</b> American tribes, particularly after the so-called Fox Wars ended in the 1730s. By the time of the Black Hawk War, the population of the two tribes was about 6,000 people.|$|E

5|$|Lewis Cass, the {{governor}} of Michigan Territory, and Thomas McKenney, the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, were hosting a treaty conference near Green Bay when they learned of the attacks. To discourage {{the spread of the}} uprising, Cass promptly invited Native Americans in the region to come to the treaty grounds to receive gifts and food; more than 2,000 people eventually arrived. McKenney warned the Ho-Chunk chiefs in attendance {{that the only way to}} avoid an American military invasion of their homeland was to surrender those responsible for the attacks. Other American officials met with <b>other</b> <b>Native</b> leaders, including Keokuk and Wabokieshiek, and urged them to stay out of the war.|$|E
5|$|Malawi's {{population}} {{is made up}} of the Chewa, Nyanja, Tumbuka, Yao, Lomwe, Sena, Tonga, Ngoni, and Ngonde native ethnic groups, as well as populations of Asians and Europeans. The official language is English. Major languages include Chichewa, a language spoken by over 57% of the population, Chinyanja (12.8%), Chiyao (10.1%), and Chitumbuka (9.5%). <b>Other</b> <b>native</b> languages are Malawian Lomwe, spoken by around 250,000 in the southeast of the country; Kokola, spoken by around 200,000 people also in the southeast; Lambya, spoken by around 45,000 in the northwestern tip; Ndali, spoken by around 70,000; Nyakyusa-Ngonde, spoken by around 300,000 in northern Malawi; Malawian Sena, spoken by around 270,000 in southern Malawi; and Tonga, spoken by around 170,000 in the north.|$|E

To the chagrin of local farmers, Missoula {{is also home to}} several noxious weeds, which multiple programs have set out to eliminate. Notable ones include Dalmatian toadflax, spotted knapweed, leafy spurge, St. John's wort, and sulfur cinquefoil. Controversially, the Norway maples that line many of Missoula's older streets have also been declared an invasive species.|$|E

5|$|Natives in the Middle Woodland period {{developed}} the Hopewell culture {{and may have}} been in Indiana as early as 200 BC. The Hopewells were the first culture to create permanent settlements in Indiana. About 1 AD, the Hopewells mastered agriculture and grew crops of sunflowers and squash. Around 200 AD, the Hopewells began to construct mounds used for ceremonies and burials. The Hopewells in Indiana were connected by trade to <b>other</b> <b>native</b> tribes as far away as Central America. For unknown reasons, the Hopewell culture went into decline around 400 and completely disappeared by 500.|$|E
5|$|Pitman was a hapa-haole, of part Hawaiian {{and part}} Caucasian descent. His father {{was white and}} his {{native-born}} mother was also part Caucasian from her own mother, who {{was the daughter of}} Captain Cox and a Hawaiian chiefess. Despite his mixed-race ancestry, Pitman avoided the racial segregation imposed on <b>other</b> <b>Native</b> Hawaiian volunteers in this period. Most Native Hawaiians who participated in the war were assigned to colored regiments, but Pitman's fair skin color meant he was able to serve in a white unit, indicating that unit assignment may have been influenced by how dark Hawaiians appeared. Historians Bob Dye, James L. Haley and others claimed Pitman was placed in the colored regiments because of his mixed race, but regiment records indicate otherwise.|$|E
