5|$|In non-Christian states, {{coronation}} rites {{evolved from}} a variety of sources, often related to the religious beliefs <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> nation. Buddhism, for instance, influenced the coronation rituals of Thailand, Cambodia and Bhutan, while Hindu elements {{played a significant role in}} Nepalese rites. The ceremonies used in modern Egypt, Malaysia, Brunei and Iran were shaped by Islam, while Tonga's ritual combines ancient Polynesian influences with more modern Anglican ones.|$|E
5|$|Official state {{horses are}} one of many state symbols officially {{designated}} by states. Each state has its own flag and state seal, and many states also designate other symbols, including animals, plants, and foods. Such items usually are designated because of their ties to the culture or history <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> state. In addition to being state symbols in their own right, horses have also appeared in state symbols; for example, a horse's head appears on the Seal of New Jersey.|$|E

Live and Dangerous also comes as a double CD set, with two bonus tracks which are both unused live recordings. Previous CD editions of Live and Dangerous were single discs.|$|E
5|$|The {{altering}} of the qibla {{was precisely}} the reason the Rashidun caliph Umar, despite identifying the mosque which Muhammad used to ascend to Heaven upon his arrival at the Noble Sanctuary in 638, neither prayed facing it nor built any structure upon it. This was because the significance <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> spot on the Noble Sanctuary was superseded in Islamic jurisprudence by the Kaaba in Mecca after the change of the qibla towards that site.|$|E
5|$|The three {{story lines}} are told nonlinearly, each {{separated}} by five centuries. The three periods are interwoven with match cuts and recurring visual motifs; Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz play {{the main characters}} in all three narratives. Even within a given narrative, the elements <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> story are not told in chronological order.|$|E

5|$|Many {{critics have}} {{challenged}} the second premise of this argument, {{by offering a}} biological and sociological account {{of the development of}} human morality which suggests that it is neither objective nor absolute. This account, supported by biologist E. O. Wilson and philosopher Michael Ruse, proposes that the human experience of morality is a by-product of natural selection, a theory philosopher Mark D. Linville calls evolutionary naturalism. According to the theory, the human experience of moral obligations was the result of evolutionary pressures, which attached a sense of morality to human psychology because it was useful for moral development; this entails that moral values do not exist independently of the human mind. Morality might be better understood as an evolutionary imperative in order to propagate genes and ultimately reproduce. No human society today advocates immorality, such as theft or murder, because it would undoubtedly lead to the end <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> society and any chance for future survival of offspring. Scottish empiricist David Hume made a similar argument, that belief in objective moral truths is unwarranted and to discuss them is meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} {{installment}} was released in 1995, the Tales series has grown to include the main entries and multiple spin-offs that derive multiple gameplay and narrative elements from the main entries. Except when indicated by naming, the main Tales entries are separate from each other apart from gameplay mechanics and themes. While Tales titles are often ported to new consoles after their original release, these remakes are rarely localized. The 2006 Nintendo DS game Tales of the Tempest was originally seen as a main entry in the series, but in 2007 was classified as a spin-off, possibly due to poor reception <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> title.|$|E
5|$|When any {{aircraft}} {{passes the}} critical mach <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>particular</b> airframe, {{the centre of}} pressure shifts rearwards. This causes a pitch down moment on the aircraft if the centre of gravity remains where it was. The engineers designed the wings in a specific manner to reduce this shift, {{but there was still}} a shift of about 2metres. This could have been countered by the use of trim controls, but at such high speeds this would have dramatically increased drag. Instead, the distribution of fuel along the aircraft was shifted during acceleration and deceleration to move the centre of gravity, effectively acting as an auxiliary trim control.|$|E
