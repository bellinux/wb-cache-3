30|$|The figure shows {{a declining}} {{trend of the}} rates <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> capital. In 2010, the {{last year when the}} {{estimate}} is available, the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> was as low as 5.1  %. Note that this is the average rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> capital <b>of</b> the whole country. For firms with some monopoly power, the marginal rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> capital is lower than the average rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> because the latter includes the monopoly profit, and therefore the average marginal rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> capital <b>of</b> the whole country is below 5.1  %. Furthermore, because the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> capital varies across investment projects, there must be many projects with marginal rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> even lower than 5.1  %. These results about the rates <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> capital suggest that one needs to be concerned about overinvestment, especially if the declining trend continues.|$|R

One advantage and interesting element {{in our analysis}} in this paper is that we explain three stylised facts on the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> education using new primary data in Sudan: first, positive but low rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> education and correlations between education, experience, its square and wages {{for men and women}} defined by gender, second, positive and significant rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> education and correlations between education, experience, its square and wages defined by firm size and industry at the micro level across industrial firms and third, an increase in skill levels and firm size leads to improved relationship between actual education, required education, experience, its square and wages at the micro level across industrial firms.

Estimating the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> education is a main topic of economic research. In this paper we analyzed the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> higher education in Romania using the well-known Mincer equation. Besides the educational level and the number of years of experience on the labor market we also used a series of socio-demographic variables such as gender, civil status, the area of residence. We were interested mainly in calculating the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> higher education, therefore we computed this rate for bachelor, master and doctoral degrees separately. We also investigated the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> higher education on technical, science, economics, law, medicine, and arts fields.

Typically, there could be increasing returns at relatively low output levels, decreasing returns at relatively high output levels, and constant returns at one output level between those ranges.|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} social rates <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> electricity {{generating capacity}} and paved roads {{by looking at}} their effect on aggregate output and comparing this to their costs of construction. Our results are driven by our finding that both types of infrastructure are highly complementary with physical and human capital, but have rapidly diminishing returns if increased in isolation. This produces an optimal mix of capital inputs and makes it very easy for a country to have too much, or too little, infrastructure. For policy purposes, we compare the rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> investing in infrastructure with our estimated rate <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> capital as a whole. The strong complementarity we find between physical and human capital, and lower prices of investment goods in developed countries, means that we calculate that rich countries have rates <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> capital just as high {{as those in the}} poorest countries, though the highest rates <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> capital are found in the class of middle income (per capita) countries. We find that the rates <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> both electricity generating capacity and paved roads are on a par with, or lower than, that on other forms of capital in most countries.

5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} vertical landing, {{in a similar}} fashion to the way that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable <b>of</b> <b>returning</b> <b>to</b> the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an arrestor wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.|$|E
