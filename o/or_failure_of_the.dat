5|$|The {{objective}} for the 11th as the attacking {{force was}} to capture Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield near Fort Bragg in North Carolina, {{after which the}} maneuver was named. The defending forces were to try to defend the airport {{and the surrounding area}} and repel the airborne assault. The entire operation would be observed by Lieutenant General McNair. His observations and reports to the U.S. War Department, and ultimately General Eisenhower, would do much to decide the success <b>or</b> <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exercise. The Knollwood Maneuver took place on the night of 7 December, with the troops of the 11th Airborne Division being delivered to thirteen separate objectives by 200 C-47 Dakota transport aircraft and 234 Waco CG-4A gliders, with eighty-five percent of the airborne troops being delivered to their target without navigational error. The transport aircraft were divided into four groups, each taking off from a different airfield in the Carolinas, with two groups dropping paratroopers and two towing gliders, and between them deployed 4,800 airborne troops in the first wave. These airborne troops then seized the Knollwood Army Auxiliary Airfield from the defending troops and secured the area in which the rest of the division landed, all before daylight. Having secured their initial objectives, the 11th Airborne Division then conducted a coordinated ground attack against a reinforced infantry regiment, as well as several aerial resupply and casualty evacuation missions in coordination with transport aircraft. The exercise was judged to be a great success by those who observed it. McNair reported that the success of the maneuver pleased him, and highlighted the great improvements in airborne training that had occurred in the months between the end of Operation Husky and the Knollwood Maneuver. Due {{to the success of the}} units of the 11th Airborne Division during the exercise, the divisional-sized airborne force was deemed to be effective and was allowed by Eisenhower to remain.|$|E

At the same time, Percy finds out that Grover, who has left on a quest to find the missing god Pan, has been captured by the cyclops Polyphemus and that the Fleece is on Polyphemus' island. Together with Annabeth and his half-brother Tyson, a cyclops, Percy sets out to rescue Grover. Meanwhile, Clarisse La Rue, daughter of Ares, is sent on an official quest by Camp Half-Blood to retrieve the Fleece. The trip to the Sea of Monsters is long and hazardous and along the way the heroes encounter several dangers including Scylla and Charybdis, the sorceress Circe, the Sirens and their former friend Luke Castellan.

500|$|The {{digestive}} {{system of the}} horse is somewhat delicate. [...] Horses are unable to regurgitate food, except from the esophagus. [...] Thus, if they overeat or eat something poisonous, vomiting is not an option.

[...] Because of these factors, they are very susceptible to colic, which is {{a leading cause of}} death in horses. [...] Therefore, horses require clean, high-quality feed, provided at regular intervals, and may become ill if subjected to abrupt changes in their diets. Horses are also sensitive to molds and toxins. [...] For this reason, they must never be fed contaminated fermentable materials such as lawn clippings.

[...] In his 1926 analysis, H. W. Garrod felt that the end of the poem did not match with the rest of the poem: [...] "Perhaps the fourth stanza is more beautiful than any of the others—and more true. The trouble is that it is a little too true. Truth to his main theme has taken Keats rather farther than he meant to go... This pure cold art makes, in fact, a less appeal to Keats than the Ode as a whole would pretend; and when, in the lines that follow these lines, he indulges the jarring apostrophe 'Cold Pastoral' [...] he has said more than he meant—or wished to mean." [...] In 1933, M. R. Ridley described the poem as a [...] "tense ethereal beauty" [...] with a [...] "touch of didacticism that weakens the urgency" [...] of the statements. Douglas Bush, following in 1937, emphasized the Greek aspects of the poem and stated, [...] "as in the Ode to Maia, the concrete details are suffused with a rich nostalgia. The hard edges of classical Greek writing are softened by the enveloping emotion and suggestion. In his classical moments Keats is a sculptor whose marble becomes flesh." ...|$|E

Approximately 98% of IGF-1 is always bound to one of 6 binding proteins (IGF-BP). IGFBP-3, the most abundant protein, accounts for 80% of all IGF binding. IGF-1 binds to IGFBP-3 in a 1:1 molar ratio.
