40|$|We report {{nanofabrication}} {{of protein}} dot and line patterns using a nanofountain {{atomic force microscopy}} probe (NFP). Biomolecules are continuously fed in solution through an integrated microfluidic system, and deposited directly onto a substrate. Deposition is controlled by application of an electric potential of appropriate sign and magnitude between the probe reservoir and substrate. Submicron dot and line molecular patterns were generated with resolution that depended on {{the magnitude of the}} applied voltage, dwell time, and writing speed. By using an energetic argument and a Kelvin condensation model, the quasi-equilibrium liquid–air interface at the probe tip was determined. The analysis revealed the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for electric fields in achieving protein transport to the substrate and confirmed experimental observations suggesting that pattern resolution is controlled by tip sharpness and not overall probe aperture. As such, the NFP combines the high-resolution of dip-pen nanolithography with the efficient continuous liquid feeding of micropipettes while allowing scalability to 1 - and 2 D probe arrays for high throughput...|$|E

40|$|It is {{proposed}} that the evolutionary <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to sleep is the removal of neurotransmitters (NTs) that escape reuptake and accumulate in brain interstitial fluid. Recent work suggests that the activity of ionotropic postsynaptic receptors, rapidly initiated by binding of NTs to extracellular sites, is modulated over longer times by adsorption of these NTs to the lipid bilayers in which the receptors are embedded. This bilayer-mediated mechanism is far less molecularly specific than binding, so bilayer adsorption of NTs that have diffused into synapses for other receptors would modulate their activity as well. Although NTs are recycled by membrane protein reuptake, the process is less than 100 % efficient; a fraction escapes the region in which these specific reuptake proteins are localized and eventually diffuses throughout the interstitial fluid. It is estimated that even if only 0. 1 % of NTs escape reuptake, they would accumulate and adsorb to bilayers in synapses of other receptors sufficiently to affect receptor activity, the harmful consequences of which are avoided by sleep: a period of efficient convective clearance of solutes together with greatly reduced synaptic activity...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to offer a {{straightforward}} manual to anyone who authors their own original work or who utilises the original work of other creators. As such, {{it is necessary to}} briefly and clearly explain the historical development and essential terms of authorship as a concept and the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for copyright protection. Furthermore, this thesis includes chapters on copyright protection development specifically in the Czech Republic and the current definition of related laws in particular. Consequently, {{some of the most important}} provisions of the copyright protection laws are discussed. This practical manual, which is based on the theoretical findings from the first section of the thesis, introduces the problematic issue of how to best proceed when attempting to protect an author's original work under current copyright laws. Additionally, this manual also deals with how to avoid infringing on copyright laws when utilising other authors' original work. The following chapter focuses on the collective management of copyrights, its development as an instrument of copyright protection and its effectiveness in the Czech Republic.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a Master Thesis {{studying}} the human need for Self-Fulfillment, presented as {{the equivalent of}} Self-Actualization, {{in the context of}} entrepreneurship. The problems identified in the field are the lack of literature on Self-Actualization in entrepreneurship although it is something observed in the world, the lack of empirical data in the field of motivation, and finally the fact Self-Actualization is a need leading an individual to contribute to his or her surrounding (unlike other needs), which makes understanding its consequences and origin all the more important. Two aspects were chosen to cover the topic: tracing the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> and understanding how entrepreneurs fulfill it (for those using their compa-ny for that purpose). To do so, interviews consisting of 4 themes were carried out with 12 individuals having started and running their company (both genders, various cultural backgrounds, with companies of various size, age and industry), and driven by the need to Self-Fulfill. The main findings are the fact the individual’s mindset and attitudes seem to be what enables him or her to reach Self-Actualization, and these human qualities and characteristic could be gathered under the terms “Personal Development”. Also some people felt the need to Self-Actualize before starting the venture and thus have an idea of how to contribute: the company be-comes only a step in the process. Others reached the need after starting the company and see it as a set of opportunities to Self-Actualize. In both case however, a holistic view over the firm seems to {{be the only way to}} truly actualize through it: every aspect of the business needs to be focused on helping and improvement (not just the business idea). Finally, by expanding the findings made in entrepreneurship, this paper suggests that in general, Personal Development may  lead to society’s improvement and provides some suggestions to continue the study...|$|E

40|$|In Mr. Britling Sees It Through, H. G. Wells’ {{incredibly}} successful 1916 book, {{one of the}} Wellsian alter egos {{that are}} so characteristic for his oeuvre is “passing along the road towards the Dower House. ” The scene comes at the end – {{although it is not}} the end – of a book that forms the conscious intervention of the public intellectual seeking to provide interpretation and guidance for an audience that was forced to react to the crisis of war. What is important in Mr. Britling however is that it is shaped by another crisis (although it is largely the same crisis according to the book) that is most strikingly evoked when Mr. Britling is passing along the road towards Dower House, “receding up the hill, atlas and papers in his hands behind his back”; or to put it better, it is most strikingly evoked by the fact that Mr. Britling walking with his atlas is a display for the other characters who are engaged in conversation on account of Teddy’s homecoming. As they look at “the knickerbockered figure” through the window, Letty stops her husband when he is about to go and tell Mr. Britling the good news, having “a vision of Mr. Britling suddenly called out of his dreams of God ruling the United States of the World, to rejoice at Teddy’s restoration [...] . ” and telling her husband to “‘[l]eave him to dream over his atlas [...] . He isn’t so desolate – if you knew [...] . [ [...] . ] Let him go [...] . He has God and his atlas there [...] . They’re more than you think. ’” My paper will attempt to read scenes such as these as moments that highlight the crisis of the public intellectual itself. Right when he or she is formulating political, social and personal redemption from the problems that are the <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> of the public intellectual in the first place, the mode itself that allows for the judgment call is exposed to an irony it itself has invited. The role of the public intellectual himself (in this case) as the purveyor of judgment is threatened not by the collapse, as Mr. Britling seems to suggest at times, that is caused by the message and its content, but by the ironic mode that is demanded from a scene where a grey old man is rummaging through atlases in an attempt to redraw the borders of nation states. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I explore whether blind trusts {{present a}} viable option for {{campaign}} finance reform. More specifically, would either permitting (voluntary) or requiring (mandatory) anonymous donations for political campaigns allow for fully funded, yet privately funded, campaigns while preventing problems, whether real or perceived, such as buying influence (quid pro quo) or buying access, which are traditionally associated with large campaign donations? To study this question, I have examined <b>the</b> constitutional <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to fund federal campaigns, Congress’ power to regulate campaigns under the Constitution’s Elections Clause, <b>the</b> constitutional protection <b>of</b> speech, and <b>the</b> concern <b>of</b> large donations corrupting the political system. Further, I have also reviewed and summarized <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> campaign finance law and salient court decisions regarding <b>the</b> history <b>of</b> campaign finance regulation. Finally, I have reviewed <b>the</b> current use <b>of</b> blind trusts by government officials as well as existing relevant literature suggesting blind trusts may be {{a viable option}} for campaign reform. Having reviewed the salient constitutional history, law, and discourse, voluntary blind trusts could offer {{a great deal of}} protection to candidates from <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> impropriety, while possibly working complementary to existing campaign finance restrictions. There are conflicting principles at play between making campaign finance trusts completely anonymous to avoid even <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> impropriety and republican principles <b>of</b> disclosure, <b>the</b> First Amendment, and the ability to police non-disclosure of donations. This analysis is important because there is a legitimate public interest in preventing not only the quid pro quo of trading campaign donations for votes or access to politicians, but protecting against even <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> impropriety. Voluntary blind trusts may prove part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solution <b>of</b> campaign finance reform while offering candidates additional protection from even <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> impropriety.

What these early studies had in common was, first, a basically sim-ilar methodological approach whereby statements about media func-tions were elicited from the respondents in an essentially open-ended way.

Greater understanding of immigrant cultures and histories to better enhance interaction. <b>The</b> <b>need</b> to make U. S. citizenship significant to naturalized citizens to keep them engaged here {{as much as they}} are with their countries <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> 5) <b>The</b> <b>need</b> to standardize <b>the</b> U.

40|$|The {{last two}} decades have been an era when {{computation}} is ahead of analysis and when very large scale practical computations are increasingly used in poorly understood multiscale complex nonlinear physical problems and non-traditional fields. Ensuring a higher level <b>of</b> confidence in <b>the</b> predictability and reliability (PAR) of these numerical simulations could {{play a major role}} in furthering the design, understanding, affordability and safety of our next generation air and space transportation systems, and systems for planetary and atmospheric sciences, and in understanding <b>the</b> evolution and <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> life. <b>The</b> <b>need</b> to guarantee PAR becomes acute when computations offer <b>the</b> ONLY way <b>of</b> solving these types of data limited problems. Employing theory from nonlinear dynamical systems, some building blocks to ensure a higher level of confidence in PAR of numerical simulations have been revealed by the author and world expert collaborators in relevant fields. Five building blocks with supporting numerical examples were discussed. The next step is to utilize knowledge gained by including nonlinear dynamics, bifurcation and chaos theories as an integral part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> numerical process. The third step is to design integrated criteria for reliable and accurate algorithms that cater to the different multiscale nonlinear physics. This includes but is not limited to <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> appropriate adaptive spatial and temporal discretizations that are suitable for the underlying governing equations. In addition, a multiresolution wavelets approach for adaptive numerical dissipation/filter controls for high speed turbulence, acoustics and combustion simulations will be sought. These steps are corner stones for guarding against spurious numerical solutions that are solutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> discretized counterparts but are not solutions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underlying governing equations...|$|R

Petrol. {{studies in the}} transitional zone established that: (1) the transition is prograde; (2) metamorphic temps. in the transitional areas were 700 - 800 Â°, pressures were 5 - 7 kilobars, and H 2 O pressures were 0. 1 - 0. 3 times total pressures; and (3) the incipient granulite-grade metamorphism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transitional areas was introduced by a wave of anatexis and K-metasomatism. Charnockites so formed are hybrids of anatectic granite and metabasite, of metabasite and immediately adjacent gneiss, or are virtually isochem. with pre-existing gneiss despite gross recrystn. to granulite mineralogy. These features show that partial melting and metasomatism are attendant, rather than causative, in charnockite development. Copious CO 2 from a deep-crustal or mantle source pushed ahead of it a wave of more aq. solns. which promoted anatexis. Granulite metamorphism of neosome and paleosome followed. The massif charnockites show many evidences of having gone undergone the same process.

40|$|It {{has been}} shown that the {{exposure}} to airborne particulate matter is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most significant environmental risks people face. Since indoor environment is where people spend <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> time, in order to protect against this risk, <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> particles <b>needs</b> to be understood: do they come from indoor, outdoor sources or both? Further, this question needs to be answered separately for each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> PM mass/number size fractions, as they originate from different sources. Numerous studies have been conducted for specific indoor environments or under specific setting. Here our aim was to go beyond <b>the</b> specifics <b>of</b> individual studies, and to explore, based on pooled data from the literature, whether there are generalizable trends in routes of exposure at homes, schools and day cares, offices and aged care facilities. To do this, we quantified the overall 24 h and occupancy weighted means of PM 10, PM 2. 5 and PN - particle number concentration. Based on this, we developed a summary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> indoor versus outdoor <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> indoor particles and compared the means to the WHO guidelines (for PM 10 and PM 2. 5) and to the typical levels reported for urban environments (PN). We showed that <b>the</b> main <b>origins</b> <b>of</b> particle metrics differ from one type of indoor environment to another. For homes, outdoor air is <b>the</b> main <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> PM 10 and PM 2. 5 but PN originate from indoor sources; for schools and day cares, outdoor air is <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> PN while PM 10 and PM 2. 5 have indoor sources; and for offices, outdoor air is <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> all three particle size fractions. While each individual building is different, leading to differences in exposure and ideally necessitating its own assessment (which is very rarely done), our findings point to <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> generalizable trends for <b>the</b> main types <b>of</b> indoor environments where people spend time, and therefore to <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> prevention measures which need to be considered in general for these environments...|$|R

We investigated <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> EMG coherence and autospectral analysis as discriminative tools to identify dystonic muscles in CD patients. We compared <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> 8 - 14 Hz autospectral peaks and 4 - 7 Hz intermuscular coherences between 10 CD patients and 10 healthy controls. Secondly, {{we compared the}} muscles with significant 4 - 7 Hz coherences with the muscles that were selected clinically for botulinum toxin treatment. Autospectral peaks between 8 and 14 Hz were significantly more often absent in the splenius capitis (SPL) muscles of CD patients compared to controls (p < 0. 01). Contrary to previous findings, {{there was no significant}} difference in <b>the</b> occurrence <b>of</b> 4 - 7 Hz intermuscular coherences between patients and controls and <b>the</b> diagnostic accuracy <b>of</b> coherence analysis to identify the clinically dystonic muscles was low. Intermuscular EMG coherence analysis cannot reliably discriminate patients from controls. Autospectral changes in the SPL muscles are a more discriminative feature of CD. In patients, coherence analysis does not seem to be a reliable method to identify dystonic muscles.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} <b>the</b> {{character}} <b>of</b> Eve in four Early Christian texts from the Nag Hammadi Codices, <b>the</b> Apocryphon <b>of</b> John, <b>the</b> Nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rulers, On <b>the</b> <b>Origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World and <b>the</b> Testimony <b>of</b> Truth. <b>The</b> study has two aims. First to study what traditions about Eve these texts use {{and how they}} use the traditons? Second, what purposes <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> these traditions serve? The study proceeds in a thematic way focusing on Eve’s creation, Eve’s rape, Eve’s children {{and the relationship between}} Eve and the serpent. Not all themes are present in every text. All texts are studied separately focusing on traditions behind the texts and reason for presenting Eve in a certain way. After this <b>the</b> images <b>of</b> Eve in every text are compared with each other. <b>The</b> creation <b>of</b> Eve separates <b>the</b> two characters <b>of</b> Eve, Heavenly and Earthly one. This dichotomy passes through the texts classified as Genesis interpretations and is used as a hermeneutical tool for studying Eve. Heavenly Eve escapes from <b>the</b> rape attempt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evil creator god, who is identified as <b>the</b> god <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Testament. Her escape produces Earthly Eve, material woman. <b>The</b> rape attempt <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creator god underlines the hostility and licentiousness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Testament god. Eve’s children derive from <b>the</b> rape <b>of</b> Earthly Eve and from Adam’s knowing his divine counterpart, whose name differs from the texts but it can be linked to <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> Heavenly Eve. Eve’s children stand for the division between different human classes. Eve's rape underlines <b>the</b> hostility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Testament god and explains <b>the</b> <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human <b>need</b> for <b>the</b> procreation. The serpent is either a teacher of sexual lust or when interpreted positively, is connected to Heavenly Eve or Christ and the correct instruction and enlightenment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> humans. The texts use Early Jewish, Christian and rabbinical material dealing with <b>the</b> events <b>of</b> Genesis. They rework these traditions in order to present <b>the</b> character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creator god negatively and to promote ascetic lifestyle. Through Earthly Eve <b>the</b> negativity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> creator god and <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> passions in human life are demonstrated. Heavenly Eve stands for virginity, spirituality and renunciation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bodily <b>needs</b> thus serving as a support for the ascetic lifestyle and <b>the</b> social conventions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> readers <b>of</b> texts...|$|R
40|$|Numerous ongoing {{experiments}} aim at detecting WIMP {{dark matter}} particles from the galactic halo directly through WIMP-nucleon interactions. Once such a detection is established a confirmation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galactic <b>origin</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> signal is <b>needed.</b> This requires a direction-sensitive detector. We show {{that such a}} detector can measure the velocity anisotropy beta <b>of</b> <b>the</b> galactic halo. Cosmological N-body simulations predict the dark matter anisotropy to be nonzero, beta~ 0. 2. Baryonic matter has beta= 0 and therefore a detection of a nonzero beta would be strong proof <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fundamental difference between dark and baryonic matter. We estimate the sensitivity for various detector configurations using Monte Carlo methods and we show that the strongest signal {{is found in the}} relatively few high recoil energy events. Measuring beta to <b>the</b> precision <b>of</b> ~ 0. 03 will require detecting more than 10 ^ 4 WIMP events with nuclear recoil energies greater than 100 keV for a WIMP mass of 100 GeV and a 32 S target. This number corresponds to ~ 10 ^ 6 events at all energies. We discuss variations with respect to input parameters and we show that our method is robust to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> backgrounds and discuss the possible improved sensitivity for an energy-sensitive detector.
