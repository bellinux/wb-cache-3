40|$|Microfacies {{analyses}} and X-ray fluorescence scanning (µ-XRF) at sub-mm resolution {{were conducted on}} the varved Mid- to Late Holocene interval of two sediment profiles from pre-alpine Lake Ammersee (southern Germany). The coring sites are located in a proximal (AS 10 prox) and distal (AS <b>10</b> <b>dist)</b> position towards the main tributary River Ammer, in 1. 8 km distance from each other. To shed light on sediment distribution within the lake, particular emphasis was (1) the detection of intercalated detrital layers and their micro-sedimentological features, and (2) intra-basin correlation of these event deposits. Detrital layers were dated by microscopic varve counting, verified by accelerator mass spectrometry 14 C dating of terrestrial plant macrofossils. Since ~ 5500 varve years (vyr) BP, in total 1573 detrital layers were detected in either {{one or both of}} the investigated sediment profiles. Based on their microfacies, geochemistry, and proximal-distal deposition pattern, detrital layers were interpreted as River Ammer flood deposits. Earlier studies on flood layer seasonality have proven that flood layer deposition occurs predominantly during spring and summer, the flood season at Lake Ammersee. Most prominent features of the record are the onset of regular flood layer deposition at ~ 5500 vyr BP in AS 10 prox and ~ 2800 vyr BP in AS <b>10</b> <b>dist</b> as well as three major increases in mean flood layer thickness at ~ 5500, 2800, and 400 vyr BP. Integrating information from both sediment profiles allowed to interpret these changes in terms of shifts towards higher mean flood intensity. Proposed triggering mechanisms are gradual reduction in Northern Hemisphere orbital summer forcing and superimposed centennial-scale solar activity minima. Likely responses to this forcing are enhanced equator-to-pole temperature gradients and changes in synoptic-scale atmospheric circulation. The consequences for the Ammersee region are more intense cyclones leading to extremer rainfall and flood events in spring and summer...|$|R
