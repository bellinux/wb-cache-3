40|$|The {{suppression}} of nematode egg output in faeces {{was measured in}} ewes treated just before lambing with either oxfendazole or ivermectin by <b>oral</b> <b>drench</b> or with ivermectin by subcutaneous injection. Ivermectin and oxfendazole given orally were similarly effective, whereas ivermectin given by subcutaneous injection extended the period of suppressed egg output by about one week. The more persistent anthelmintic effect of ivermectin given subcutaneously was probably due to its extended half-life in the plasma of treated sheep. Plasma pepsinogen activity was less in the sheep given anthelmintic than in the untreated controls. Ivermectin caused a significantly greater reduction in pepsinogen activity than oxfendazole and was more effective when given subcutaneously than when given orally...|$|E
40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the safety of {{moxidectin}} for goats were tested in six experiments, where two pharmaceutical forms (1 % injectable solution and 0. 1 % <b>oral</b> <b>drench)</b> of the drug were used. In experiments I and II, the drug was administered to adult goats or to kids in the following doses: 300, 600, 900 and 2 x 300 mug kg(- 1). In experiments III and IV, the drug was administered to goats before and during pregnancy in the dose of 300 mug kg(- 1). In experiments V and VI, the drug was administered to goats concurrently with an enterotoxaemia vaccine or with a flukicide in the dose of 300 mug kg(- 1). An increased (P < 0. 05) prevalence of animals with adverse reactions was recorded among adult goats, which received 900 mug kg(- 1) of moxidectin 1 % injectable solution and among kids which received 600 or 900 mug kg(- 1) of moxidectin 1 % injectable solution or 900 mug kg(- 1) moxidectin 0. 1 % <b>oral</b> <b>drench.</b> The salient reactions of the animals were: indifference to the environment, drowsiness, somnolence, salivation, ataxia and refusal of kids to suck their dams; they were observed 4 - 8 h after administration of the drug and regressed within 36 h after it. No other statistically significant adverse reactions were observed among experimental animals; no adverse reproductive effects were recorded; no effects were observed during simultaneous administration of the enterotoxaemia vaccine or the flukicide. It is concluded that although the drug appears to be safe for use to goats {{of all ages and}} reproductive stages, care should be taken to avoid inadverted overdosing. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|THERE {{has been}} {{considerable}} discussion regarding the procedure of <b>oral</b> <b>drench</b> administration to ruminants {{with the potential}} for oesophageal groove closure or rumen bypass to influence drug availability. Using a glucose marker techhique, Prichard and Hennessy (1981) demonstrated that approximately one-third of sheep drenched with oxfendazole (oFz) formulation at 22 - 65 g/litre (Systamex; Syntex Animal Health) exhibited reduced drug availability due to complete rumen bypass and approximately one-third of the treated sheep exhibited a partial rumen bypass. Because it is the duration of exposure that is a significant determi-nant of benzimidazole action (Lacey and others 1987), the reduced oFZ residence time in sheep which displayed rumen bypass was reflected in lower anthelmintic efficacy. Similar reduced benzimidazole availability, attributed to oesophageal groove closure, has been reported in cattle (McEwan and Oakle...|$|E

40|$|New Zealand {{agriculture}} utilises {{trace element}} supplements to protect livestock from fungal infection. For example Zinc (as zinc oxide) administered as an <b>oral</b> <b>drench</b> or intraruminal bolus, is used extensively to protect sheep and cattle from facial eczema.

In this paper we describe research into the efficacy of fodder with an elevated Zn concentration as a potential prophylaxis against facial eczema in sheep relative to a conventional drench. Our hypothesis is that Zn protection afforded by biofortified fodder may be realised at a relatively lower dose, thus limiting transfer of Zn into the pastoral environment. This may represent a more environmental sustainable mechanism to supplement livestock with trace elements than conventional options.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cumulative dose-dependent nonischemic {{cardiomyopathy}} (NICM) {{remains a}} significant risk {{with the use}} of some chemotherapeutic agents. In this context, omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been investigated for their cardioprotective potential in rodent and in vitro models of anthracycline toxicity, with conflicting results. This study evaluated prophylactic omega- 3 PUFA supplementation in a large-animal model of anthracycline-induced NICM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Merino sheep were randomized to <b>oral</b> <b>drenching</b> with omega- 3 PUFA (fish oil; n 5 8) or olive oil placebo (n 5 9) 3 weeks before commencing repeated intracoronary infusions of doxorubicin (DOX) to induce cardiac dysfunction. Cumulative DOX dose was 3. 6 mg/kg. Drenching was continued for 12 weeks after final DOX exposure. Despite significant increases in tissue omega- 3 PUFA levels (P <. 05 vs placebo), omega- 3 etreated sheep displayed greater signs of anthracycline cardiotoxicity than placebo animals, consisting of left ventricular dilatation and a greater decline in ejection fraction (P <. 05), although myocardial fibrosis burden was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intake of omega- 3 PUFA fails to prevent and may indeed exacerbate DOX-induced cardiotoxicity. Clinical use of omega- 3 supplementation during chemotherapy should be deferred until more information is available regarding the mechanisms of interaction between fatty acids and the myocardium during anthracycline exposure.

Four trials were undertaken, each using three lactating and three non-lactating Jersey cows. In Trial 1, the effect of drenching with 200 ml molasses was measured. Trial 2 measured the effect of a single treatment with 349 g calcium propionate in 200 ml molasses. In Trial 3, the effect of 60 g MgO in molasses alone and in combination with calcium propionate was measured. Trial 4 tested the effect of repeating treatments with 349 g calcium propionate in 200 ml molasses 24 h apart. Dosing with 349 g calcium propionate in molasses increased plasma total calcium (Catot) concentration by 10 % in lactating and non-lactating cows for periods less than 7 h, and this was not augmented by simultaneous administration of MgO or treatment 24 h earlier with 349 g calcium propionate in molasses. Treatment with 200 ml molasses alone resulted in increased plasma Catot of 7 %. Plasma glucose concentrations were elevated by 11 % for less than 3 h after treatment with calcium propionate. For the prevention of subclinical hypocalcaemia and ketosis in early lactation, drenching with calcium propionate solutions is unlikely to be of value due to the short duration of its effects, but the inclusion of calcium propionate in the postpartum ration deserves further investigation...|$|R

Forty-two crossbred steers were drenched prior to slaughter with one of three treatments: (1) Control, 1 L of distilled water, (2) 1 L of a calcium chloride solution that provided 150. 12 g of elemental calcium, and (3) 2. 5 L of a calcium propionate solution that provided 150. 60 g of elemental calcium. The longissimus, semitendinosus, and supraspinatus muscle were removed and fabricated into steaks for Warner-Bratzier shear evaluation. Calcium chloride-treated steers had higher (P 3 ̆c. 10) serum calcium levels compared to control and calcium-propionate drenched cattle. Numeric differences for muscle calcium were observed for the longissimus muscle with calcium propionate having the highest concentration. There were no differences in muscle calcium between treatments for the semitendinosus or supraspinatus muscle. Slight differences were noted among treatments for the shear force values of steaks. Longissimus tenderness from calcium prop ionate-drenched cattle tended to be lower (P =. 11) at 14 d postmortem compared to control. There were no differences among treatments at d 2, 5, 7 and 21 d. There was no benefit in tenderness due to treatment for the semitendinosus steaks nor the supraspinatus muscle. Sarcomere lengths did not differ among the treatment groups.

Experiment 1 evaluated effects of M. elsdenii on growth performance and cecal parameters in broiler chickens (n = 2520). Birds in treatment groups 1 and 2 were administered M. elsdenii culture as either an oral gavage (OG) or an aerosolized mist (AM), respectively. Treatment group 3 served as a negative control (C). Growth performance and feed efficiency (FE) were unaffected by treatment (P > 0. 10). Cecal pH was reduced in AM and OG birds compared to C (P 0. 10). Feed intake upon introduction to the nursery was greater in piglets that received M. elsdenii directly than those that did not (P < 0. 05). Large intestinal fermentation in both sows and piglets was affected by M. elsdenii administration. Fecal VFA concentrations tended to be greater in animals that received M. elsdenii either indirectly through the sow or directly via oral gavage (P < 0. 05). Direct supplementation of piglets with M. elsdenii is more effective in altering fermentation after d 21 than indirect administration, as VFA concentrations in piglets that received M. elsdenii indirectly {{are similar to the}} control by d 28. Butyrate concentrations were greater in piglets that received M. elsdenii; this VFA is important in prevention of intestinal atrophy and recovery from physiological stress of weaning. Experiment 3 examined effects of M. elsdenii administered as either an <b>oral</b> <b>drench</b> (OD) or a lyophilized powder (LP) on equine cecal fermentation compared to a negative control (NC). Cecally cannulated horses (n = 8) were transitioned to a 1 : 1 roughage to concentrate diet over a period of 5 d.

In Study 1 parasites from goats on a farm {{with a long history}} of problems with anthelmintic efficacy were used to infect sheep for a controlled slaughter study. Nineteen lambs were acquired, effectively drenched and housed. Each was infected with a mixture of larvae comprising Haemonchus contortus, Teladorsagia circumcincta, Trichostrongylus colubriformis and Oesophagostomum venulosum. After 28 days lambs were restrictively randomised into 3 groups based on faecal egg counts. Group 1 was left untreated (n= 6), Group 2 (n= 6) was given a single dose of abamectin (0. 2 mg/kg) + levamisole HCL (8 mg/kg) + oxfendazole (4. 5 mg/kg) (“Matrix <b>Oral</b> <b>Drench</b> for Sheep”®, Ancare, New Zealand) and Group 3 (n= 7) was treated at twice the dose rate of Group 2. Fourteen days after treatment all animals were killed for total worm counts. The mean burdens of T. circumcincta in Group 1 was 337, in Group 2 was 68 (efficacy 80 %) and in Group 3 was 10 (efficacy 97 %). The mean burdens of T. colubriformis in Group 1 was 375, in Group 2 was 220 (efficacy 41 %) and in Group 3 was 81 (efficacy 78 %). Although the worm burdens in these lambs were low, all animals were infected with each of these two species except for T. circumcincta in Group 3 where only 3 lambs were infected. Efficacy against other species was 100 %. These results clearly indicate that a single dose of a combination drench was ineffective against two species and even when a double dose was used the efficacy against T. colubriformis was only 78 %. In Study 2 a survey of drench efficacy was conducted on 17 goat farms using the DrenchRite® larval development assay. Evidence of concurrent resistance to benzimidazoles, levamisole and ivermectin was detected in T. colubriformis and T. circumcincta on 11 / 17 and 3 / 14 respectively.

40|$|Studies of {{the effects}} of "Mimosa bark extract" {{containing}} condensed tannins on milk production by grazing dairy cows and on ruminal protein metabolism in sheep. M. Agr. Sc. Thesis, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand. Tannins, particularly condensed tannins (CT), either added to the diet or occuring naturally in the forage are advantageous because they protect dietary protein from degradation in the rumen. The aim {{of this study was to}} measure the effect of Mimosa bark extract which contained approximately 70 % CT on grazing dairy cow performance and on ruminal protein metabolism in sheep. Two experiments were carried out over the spring season (September and October 1994). In experiment I, effects of CT in Mimosa bark extract upon blood urea concentration, milk yield and milk composition, liveweight and condition score of grazing dairy cows were evaluated. Thirty Friesian cows were allocated at random to 3 treatments :(1) Control : no Mimosa bark extract (no CT); (2) Low CT : 50 g/cow daily of Mimosa bark extract (2. 4 g CT/ kg DM eaten); (3) high CT : 100 g/cow daily of Mimosa bark extract (4. 8 g CT/kg DM eaten). Mimosa bark extract was given twice daily as a suspension by <b>oral</b> <b>drenching</b> during each milking. In experiment II, effects of CT in Mimosa bark extract on ruminal protein metabolism in sheep were evaluated. Six mature Romney sheep fitted with permanent ruminal cannulae were randomly assigned into 2 treatments in a cross-over design. The two treatments were (1) Control : no Mimosa bark extract (no CT); (2) High CT : 6. 66 g/sheep daily of Mimosa bark extract (4. 8 g CT/kg DM eaten). Mimosa bark extract was given twice daily as a suspension by <b>oral</b> <b>drenching</b> just after feeding. Dry matter intake, rates of DM disappearance by the in sacco method, rumen ammonia and blood urea concentration and apparent digestibility of dry matter and and nitrogen were measured. In experiment I, liveweight and condition score as well as milk yield and composition, were not influenced by CT. Lactose concentrations were higher in the low CT group than in the high CT group in all weeks of the experiment. Cows drenched with high CT had a lower (P< 0. 05) blood urea concentration than cows in the control group, and, in week I they were lower (P< 0. 05) than cows in the low CT group. In experiment II, rumen metabolism parameters, including dry matter intake, in sacco DM disappearance parameters (A, B, C and A+B) and apparent digestibility of DM and N were not influenced by Mimosa bark extract. However sheep drenched with high CT had lower rumen ammonia and blood urea concentrations (P< 0. 05) than the control in the whole period. These results indicate that Mimosa bark extract had no significant effect on milk production. However it did consistently and significantly reduce blood urea concentration in both cows (high CT group) and sheep and it reduced rumen ammonia concentration in sheep. This indicates that the CT did have some biological effect in the rumen namely, a reduced protein degradation in the rumen...|$|R
40|$|Adequate dietary intakes of trace {{minerals}} {{are thought}} necessary to maximize cow reproduction, calf health, and calf performance. Diets grazed by beef cattle are generally deficient to marginal in copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), selenium (Se), and zinc (Zn) concentrations; therefore, these trace minerals are usually {{added to the}} diet in supplement form. The most widely used means of trace-mineral supplementation for grazing cattle is selffed, salt-based, loose mineral supplements. Although cattle do not balance their mineral needs when consuming a self-fed mineral supplement, usually no other practical way of supplying mineral needs exists under grazing conditions. The greatest limitation to using self-fed mineral supplements is variation in animal intake. More direct methods of mineral supplementation include adding minerals to drinking water or feed, <b>oral</b> <b>drenching,</b> ruminal boluses, and injection. Variation in mineral intake is reduced relative to self-fed supplementation, and the additional labor requirement and expense are relatively small. Delivery of supplemental trace minerals using an injectable solution {{may be a more}} reliable means of achieving adequate trace-mineral status than using self-fed, salt-based, loose mineral supplements. Bolus injections of trace minerals have been associated with improved average daily gain, feed efficiency, feed intake, or health status of beef calves fed in confinement; however, trace mineral delivery methods of this type have not been fully evaluated with respect to performance of beef cows and suckling calves.

Experiment one was conducted to determine the Cu status of mature ewes fed two sources Of CU (CUS 04 VS CU proteinate) at one of three levels (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg). Ewes were fed a basal diet containing cottonseed hulls, cottonseed meal, and cracked corn at 2. 5 % BW to meet NRC requirements for protein, energy, macroninerals, and macrominerals excluding Cu. Ewes fed Cu proteinate had higher (P <. 05) ceruloplasmin (Cp) than those fed Cu sulfate (33. 2 VS 28. 2 []M/min/L). Feeding up to 30 mg/kg Cu from these sources did not cause an observable Cu toxicity during the 73 -d period. These data support the hypothesis that Cu from Cu proteinate and Cu sulfate have different biological availabilities. The primary goal of experiment two was to observe the effects of Cu deprivation in ewes during gestation on the thermogenic capabilities of neonate lambs. Twelve multiparous, twin bearing ewes were randomly assigned to low (7 ppm Cu) or high (26 ppm Cu) Cu treatment diets 3 mo prior to lambing. Ewes fed low-Cu diets received an <b>oral</b> <b>drench</b> containing ammonium tetrathiomolybdate beginning 2 mo prior to parturition. At the time of birth lambs were assigned to either a treatment (cc- methyl-DL-p-tyrosine, AMPT) or control (saline) injection group, {{in order to determine the}} effects of AMPT on the rectal temperatures of newborn lambs. Lambs were housed in environmental chambers (20 'C) until time of slaughter (12 h of age). Low-Cu fed ewes had lower (P <. 05) liver Cu concentrations than the high-Cu ewes (173 vs 802 ppm Cu, respectively). Lambs born to low-Cu fed ewes had lower (P <. 05) liver Cu concentrations than lambs born to high-Cu fed ewes (130 vs 287 ppm Cu, respectively). Lambs from low-Cu fed ewes had lower (P <. 05) rectal temperatures than lambs born to high-Cu fed ewes. The data showed that restricting Cu during gestation decreases the copper status of lambs, which in turn limits thermogenesis of newborn lambs...|$|E

Beginning 21 d before expected parturition, cows were fed either a control diet or a diet containing glycerol (5 % of DM). After parturition, cows were assigned to one of four treatments in a 2 (dietary glycerol; 3. 3 % of DM) X 2 (glycerol drench; 500 ml/d for 5 d beginning at parturition) factorial arrangement. From d 22 through 63 of lactation, cows were fed the same diet. Feeding glycerol during the prepartum period increased prepartum DMI, but feeding glycerol during the postpartum period tended to decrease postpartum DMI and drenching glycerol for the first 5 d of lactation decreased postpartum DMI. Milk yield was not affected by feeding glycerol during either the prepartum or postpartum periods or drenching glycerol during the first 5 d of lactation. Percentages and yields of milk fat and true protein were not affected by feeding glycerol during either the prepartum or postpartum periods; however, drenching glycerol tended to decrease milk protein content and decreased milk lactose content. Glycerol fed during the prepartum period resulted in no significant effects on plasma glucose, NEFA or BHBA concentrations during the prepartum period with no carry over effects on postpartum metabolites. Prepartum incorporation of glycerol in the diet resulted in no significant effects in liver triglycerides or glycogen content in liver samples collected d 1 after calving compared with control cows with no carry over effects on postpartum liver triglycerides or glycogen content. Postpartum incorporation of glycerol in the diet resulted in no significant effects on postpartum liver composition. Short term (5 -d) oral drenching of glycerol beginning at calving resulted in no significant effects on liver composition (d 10 and 21 postpartum) or on plasma glucose and NEFA. However, there was a trend for an increase in BHBA concentrations for cows drenched with glycerol. Intensive blood sampling performed on d 5 post calving demonstrated that a 500 ml oral bolus of crude glycerine significantly decreased plasma NEFA concentration with no overall significant effects on plasma glucose, BHBA, or insulin. Overall, incorporation of glycerol in to the diets of transition cows or the short-term <b>oral</b> <b>drench</b> of glycerol at calving resulted in few positive performance responses and only modest effects on metabolic variables studied.

Oral {{administration}} of cobalt acetate alters milk fatty acid composition, consistent with an inhibition of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase in lactating ewes. Journal of Dairy Science, 97 (2), 1036 - 1046 Previous investigations {{have shown that}} cobalt (Co) modifies milk fat composition in cattle, consistent with an inhibition of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity, but it remains unclear whether other ruminant species are also affected. The present study {{examined the effects of}} oral {{administration of}} Co acetate on intake, rumen function, and milk production and fatty acid (FA) composition in sheep. Twenty lactating Assaf ewes were allocated into 1 of 4 groups and used in a continuous randomized block design that involved a 15 -d adaptation, a 6 -d treatment, and a 10 -d posttreatment period. During the treatment period, animals received an <b>oral</b> <b>drench</b> supplying 0 (control), 3 (Co 3), 6 (Co 6), and 9 (Co 9) mg of Co/kg of BW per day, administered in 3 equal doses at 8 -h intervals. Cobalt acetate had no influence on intake or milk fat and protein concentrations, whereas treatments Co 6 and Co 9 tended to lower milk yield. Results on rumen parameters showed no effects on rumen fermentation, FA composition, or bacterial community structure. Administration of Co acetate decreased milk concentrations of FA containing a cis- 9 double bond and SCD product:substrate ratios, consistent with an inhibition of SCD activity in the ovine mammary gland. Temporal changes in milk fat composition indicated that the effects of treatments were evident within 3 d of dosing, with further changes being apparent after 6 d and reverting to pretreatment values by d 6 after administration. Effect on milk FA composition did not differ substantially in response to incremental doses of Co acetate. On average, Co decreased milk cis- 9 10 : 1 / 10 : 0, cis- 9 12 : 1 / 12 : 0, cis- 9 14 : 1 / 14 : 0, cis- 9 16 : 1 / 16 : 0, cis- 9 17 : 1 / 17 : 0, cis- 9 18 : 1 / 18 : 0, and cis- 9,trans- 11 18 : 2 /trans- 11 18 : 1 concentration ratios by 30, 32, 38, 33, 21, 24, and 25 %, respectively. Changes in milk fat cis- 9 10 : 1, cis- 9 12 : 1, and cis- 9 14 : 1 concentrations to Co treatment indicated that 51 % of cis- 9 18 : 1 and cis- 9,trans- 11 18 : 2 secreted in milk originated from Delta(9) -desaturation. In conclusion, results demonstrated the potential of oral Co administration for the estimation of endogenous synthesis of FA containing a cis- 9 double bond in the mammary gland of lactating ruminants. Indirect comparisons suggest that the effects of Co differ between sheep and cattle. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Anthelmintic {{resistance}} (AR) in ovine gastro-intestinal nematodes {{has been}} reported to affect the health and productivity of sheep globally. The objective {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of commonly used <b>oral</b> <b>drenches</b> in sheep in France, Greece and Italy. In each country, 10 farms were selected. On each farm, 50 animals were blocked based on the pre-treatment faecal egg count (FEC). Within each block, animals were randomly allocated to one of 5 treatment groups. In addition to an untreated control group, there were 4 groups treated per oral route: moxidectin (MOX) and ivermectin (IVM), both at 0. 2 mg/kg bodyweight, levamisole (LEV; at 7. 5 mg/kg bodyweight) and a benzimidazole (BZ; at 3. 75 - 5 mg/kg bodyweight). In France, animals were not treated with LEV, but with netobimin (NET; at 7. 5 mg/kg bodyweight). The FEC was monitored using a modified McMaster technique. Two weeks after treatment, individual faecal samples were taken from all animals and efficacy was calculated as the difference between arithmetic mean FEC of the control group versus each respective treatment group. The results of the present study indicate the high efficacy of treatment with oral formulations of MOX (99 - 100 %) and IVM (98 - 100 %) on all farms, except on 1 farm in Greece. On this farm, multi drug resistance (MDR) was identified involving 4 anthelmintics (efficacy MOX: 91 %; IVM: 0 %; BZ: 58 % and LEV: 87 %). In Greece and Italy, AR against LEV and BZ was observed on some farms, with MDR involving both anthelmintics on 3 farms in Greece and on 2 farms in Italy. In France, AR against BZ and NET was observed on all 10 farms included. In all countries, Teladorsagia sp. was the most common nematode larva identified after treatment, followed by Haemonchus sp. and Trichostrongylus sp., with differences among farms and treatments. The current study confirms the high efficacy of oral treatments with MOX and IVM, even on farms with worm populations resistant to BZ, LEV or NET.

40|$|Spirulina (Arthrospira platensis) is an edible {{cyanobacterium}} rich {{in protein}} and several essential fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins and minerals. This has raised its profile {{as a potential}} supplement in lamb production. Yet, the underpinning effects of Spirulina supplementation on lamb products – wool and meat – interrelations vital to its applicability in the sheep industry is presently largely unknown. Therefore, our experimental objective was to evaluate the correlations between changes in wool quality traits, body conformation and liveweight measurements in lambs supplemented with Spirulina, as affected by sex and supplementation level. Over two consecutive years (2011 - 12) at the University Farm Cambridge, Tasmania, Australia, a mating ratio of 1 terminal ram to 100 Merino ewes was applied to produce approximately 1600 crossbred progeny. At 12 weeks of age, all progeny were weaned onto ryegrass pasture. At 6 months old, a total of 48 lambs was randomly selected for each feeding trial (24 per year). These were then randomly allocated into Spirulina supplementation treatment levels – CONTROL (0 mL), LOW (100 mL) or HIGH (200 mL) – and balanced by sex – ewes and wethers. Each feeding trial continued for 9 -weeks including 3 -weeks of adjustment, during which Spirulina was directly supplemented daily to lambs via <b>oral</b> <b>drenching</b> as a water suspension with a 1 : 10 w/v ration of Spirulina (g) : Water (mL). All lambs received barley grain daily (150 g) and had ad libitum access to drinking water and a basal diet of ryegrass pasture throughout the trial. Individual lamb body conformation and liveweight measurements were taken at the start and end of each feeding trial on chest girth (CG), wither height (WH), body length (BL), body condition score (BCS), and liveweight (BWT). Midside wool samples were taken and analysed for clean fleece yield (YIELD), mean fibre diameter (FD), coefficient of fibre diameter variation (CV), fibre diameter standard deviation (SD), comfort factor (CF), fibre curvature (CURV) and spinning fineness (SF). All data were transformed to changes (Δ) in wool quality traits over the feeding trial by subtracting final from initial measurements. SAS analysis for significant (P 0. 05). However, in wethers, ΔBCS and ΔCURV were negatively correlated (- 0. 90). In the HIGH Spirulina supplementation group, ΔYIELD was significantly correlated with ΔBL (0. 86) and ΔBWT (- 0. 80) in wether and ewe lambs respectively. All other correlations were insignificant (P> 0. 05). In conclusion, this study does not only demonstrate Spirulina’s potential as a nutritious lamb supplement, but the relationships and strength of the correlations between wool, body conformation and liveweight will assist in product management {{and serve as a}} tool for achieving desired wool and growth goals in sheep flocks...|$|R

ThomsonA {{series of}} studies were {{conducted}} in order to develop, test, implement, and utilize an objective and comprehensive gross pathology scoring system for cattle at slaughter. Individual lung, liver, and rumen gross pathology data was collected from 19, 229 head of cattle and corresponding individual pre-harvest and carcass data for a subset of 13, 226 head [...] Across the entire population 22. 6 % and 9. 8 % of cattle displayed mild and severe lesions, respectively. Severe lung lesions {{at the time of}} slaughter were associated with a decreased ADG of 0. 07 kg/ day and a carcass weight 7. 1 kg less than that of their cohorts with no visible signs of pulmonary BRDC lesions (P < 0. 01). Overall, 68. 6 % of cattle observed had normal livers, free from abscesses and other abnormalities. Cattle with a severe liver abscess at the time of slaughter were associated with a 0. 10 kg/day during the feeding period (P < 0. 01). Of cattle severely affected by liver abscesses (A+, 4. 6 %), 14. 9 % also displayed severe BRDC lung lesions and 28. 3 % of cattle displayed mild BRDC lung lesions. Rumenitis lesions were observed in 24. 1 % of the overall study population. Severe rumenitis lesions were associated with a significant decrease in average daily gain and carcass weight (0. 03 kg/day and 2. 20 kg, respectively, P < 0. 01). The system was also implemented on a population of cull cows at a commercial abattoir in the Great Lakes region of the U. S. (n= 1, 461; 87 % Holstein, 13 % other cows). Severe liver abscesses, were observed in 18. 5 % of cull cows at slaughter. Severe rumenitis lesions or rumenitis scars were observed in 10 % and severe BRDC lesions were observed in 10. 3 % o of the population. A prospective study of a commercially available, direct fed microbial <b>oral</b> <b>drench</b> of Megasphaera elsdenii (NCIMB 41125) was conducted in 4, 863 head of yearling feeder cattle.

40|$|Anthracycline drugs, such as Doxorubicin (Adriamycin) (DOX), {{have been}} widely used since the 1960 s for {{treatment}} of various forms of cancer. Despite their excellent anti-tumour affects, their clinical use may be complicated by various forms of cardiotoxicity, most notably dose dependent, non-ischaemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NICM) leading to congestive heart failure (CHF). Increasingly, different strategies have been devised in recent years to mitigate the adverse cardiovascular effects of anthracycline administration. However these have had variable success and the burden of anthracycline induced NICM remains substantial. Marine derived omega- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) have been shown to have cardio-protective properties in a number of clinical settings. These include anti-arrhythmic, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties and which are predominantly mediated by the longer chain omega- 3 PUFA, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Previously, a limited number of basic and small animal studies have evaluated the protective actions of omega- 3 PUFA against anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity, with mixed findings. There-fore the current study set out to expand on these results by investigating omega- 3 PUFA supplementation in the translational setting of a large animal model of DOX-induced NICM. Initially, a pilot study was performed to assess fatty acid bio distribution in Merino wether sheep receiving marine fish oil (containing 300 mg/mL EPA+DHA), administered by <b>oral</b> <b>drenching</b> of 23 mL volumes three times weekly for up to 20 weeks. Plasma and erythrocyte fatty acids were monitored serially and myocardial membrane concentrations were determined at study end. Systemic and myocardial uptake of long-chain omega- 3 PUFA was demonstrated, with plasma, erythrocyte and myocardial concentrations increasing by two to three-fold from baseline levels (p< 0. 05). For the main study, 17 age and weight-matched Merino wethers received fortnightly dosing with intracoronary DOX (1. 2 mg/kg for three doses) to induce cardiotoxicity. Animals were randomised to oral supplementation with fish oil (n= 8) or olive oil placebo (n= 9) commencing two to three weeks before DOX dosing and continued until 12 weeks after final DOX dose. Comparisons between the fish oil and placebo groups were made for left ventricular remodelling and function by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR), transthoracic echocardiography and histomorphometric analysis of myocardial fibrosis burden. Surprisingly, by comparison to placebo animals, sheep in the fish oil group showed greater decline in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (p< 0. 05), and greater end-diastolic and end-systolic dilatation after DOX (p< 0. 05). However, both groups demonstrated similar levels of left ventricular fibrosis, suggesting that the accentuation of systolic dysfunction observed in the omega- 3 PUFA cohort was not mediated by excess myocardial collagen deposition. In summary, this is the first large animal study to evaluate omega- 3 PUFA supplementation in the setting of anthracycline cardiotoxicity. Despite augmenting circulating and tissue long-chain fatty acid levels, oral intake of fishoil exacerbated cardiac remodelling induced by intracoronary DOX. Given these new observational findings, we recommend deferring clinical investigation until further basic mechanistic studies can better define the interactions between fatty acids and cardiac biology in the presence of anthracycline exposure.

40|$|Three main {{preventive}} principles against {{milk fever}} were evaluated in this literature review, and {{the efficacy of}} each principle was estimated {{from the results of}} controlled investigations. <b>Oral</b> calcium <b>drenching</b> around calving apparently has a mean efficacy of 50 %– 60 % in terms of milk fever prevention as well as prevention of milk fever relapse after intravenous treatment with calcium solutions. However, some drenches have been shown to cause lesions in the forestomacs. When using the DCAD (dietary cation-anion difference) principle, feeding rations with a negative DCAD (measured as (Na + K) – (Cl + S)) significantly reduce the milk fever incidence. Calculating the relative risk (RR) of developing milk fever from controlled experiments results in a mean RR between 0. 19 and 0. 35 when rations with a negative versus positive DCAD are compared. The main drawback from the DCAD principle is a palatability problem. The principle of feeding rations low in calcium is highly efficient in milk fever prevention provided the calcium intake in the dry period is kept below 20 g per day. Calculating the relative risk (RR) of developing milk fever from controlled experiments results in a very low mean RR (between 0 and 0. 20) (daily calcium intake below versus above 20 g/d). The main problem in implementing the low-Ca principle is difficulties in formulating rations sufficiently low in calcium when using commonly available feeds. The use of large doses of vitamin D metabolites and analogues for milk fever prevention is controversial. Due to toxicity problems and an almost total lack of recent studies on the subject this principle is not described in detail. A few management related issues were discussed briefly, and the following conclusions were made: It is important to supply the periparturient cow with sufficient magnesium to fulfil its needs, and to prevent the dry cows from being too fat. Available information on the influence of carbohydrate intake, and on the effect of the length of the dry period and prepartum milking, is at present insufficient to include these factors in control programmes. </p...|$|R
40|$|Two {{indoor feeding}} {{experiments}} were {{conducted at the}} Animal Physiology Unit (APU) of Massey University, involving young sheep, to investigate the effect of feeding forage willow upon the death of established parasites and upon parasite fecundity, using chaffed lucerne as the control diet. Experiment 1 : Twenty-four (24) parasite-free weaned hoggets weighing 29. 9 ± 1. 2 kg (SD) were individually penned and fed chaffed lucerne ad libitum during a preexperimental adaption period of 5 weeks. They were then fed either lucerne chaff or chopped willow for a further 5 weeks (n = 12 /group) and intakes were adjusted such that the DMI {{of the two groups}} was similar during weeks 9 & 10. All lambs were infected with L 3 larvae parasites comprising 20, 650 Teladorsagia, 1, 320 Trichostrongylus and 330 Cooperia through <b>oral</b> <b>drenching</b> 12 days before willow feeding started. This was done after confirmation that the sheep were free of nematodes through FEC analysis. Total faeces were collected for 3 day periods towards the end of weeks 9 & 10, to measure diet digestibility and total faecal egg excretion. The sheep were slaughtered at the end of week 10. Voluntary feed intake (VFI), FEC and liveweight were measured weekly, whilst burdens of individual parasites and carcass characteristics were measured after slaughter. Duplicate samples of each feed offered and individual animal refusals were taken daily and pooled weekly per animal for chemical analysis. Female worm fecundity was calculated by two methods. Blood samples for immunological analysis were collected on days 20, 34, 51 and 70, and analysed for components of white blood cells (WBC) and for lymphocyte subsets. Experiment 2 : A 2 x 2 changeover experiment was conducted, involving two time periods (Period 1 and Period 2 each of 14 days) with the same diets as used in Experiment 1, fed to 9 individually penned parasite-free young sheep randomly allocated to experimental diets. The parameters investigated were FEC and larvae hatching. Initially, a period of 7 days was allowed for acclimatisation in which both groups were fed on half willow and half lucerne chaff. This was followed by Period 1 with 4 lambs fed lucerne and 5 fed willow, after which the diets were changed over for Period 2. Total faeces produced were collected from all animals {{on the last day of}} each period using bagged sheep. A known number of Teladorsagia eggs (500 epg) was then added to faecal samples from these sheep and faeces-egg mixtures were made from which FEC was determined, to see if egg recovery was affected by these diets. Faecal samples for Period 2 with added eggs were also incubated for 10 days to measure hatchability. The recovery of added Teladorsagia eggs in Experiment 2 was 85 % in lucerne-fed lambs and 53 % willow-fed lambs (P 0. 05) but declined with the introduction of willow in week 6 (P 0. 05). Calculated DM intake per head/day during the last two weeks of Experiment 1 was similar for the two groups (P> 0. 05); while the willow group had higher ME (P 0. 05), then declined for willow-fed lambs in week 6 (P 0. 1). It was concluded that feeding chopped willow to young sheep reduced nematode worm burdens in the abomasum, especially both male and female Haemonchus spp., and reduced female worm burdens of Teladorsagia spp. Female worm fecundity of both species was also reduced by willow feeding. These reductions have been associated with CT content in the willow feed and the reduced worm burdens have been attributed to the death of the established worms by CT, since there was no evidence of immune priming in willow-fed sheep. Compounds present in the faeces of willow-fed sheep have been found to mask some of the nematode eggs, making them invisible by microscopic examination while keeping their viability. It is postulated that this could be due to binding of nematode eggs to insoluble CT associated with indigestible fibre in the faeces of willow-fed sheep. Conventional methods of measuring FEC therefore underestimated nematode eggs present in the faeces of willow-fed sheep and this needs to be checked for other CT-containing forages...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Selenium (Se) is an {{essential}} micronutrient of sheep. Supplementation is especially important in young lambs {{in order to prevent}} Se-deficiency signs. In the United States, the FDA regulates Se supplementation to ruminant diets at a level of 0. 3 mg/kg Se (as fed basis). Questions still exist regarding what chemical form of Se is the most bioavailable supplement and what are the best supplementation rates for optimal productivity. Three interrelated experiments from the same study were conducted 1) to evaluate the effect of Se source and supplementation rate in ewes on Se status of their lambs at birth, 2) to examine the effect of Se source and supplementation rate on IgG concentrations in ewe colostrum and lamb serum, and 3) to evaluate the effects of Se source and supplementation rate on ewe reproductive performance and subsequent vitality and growth performance of their lambs. For these experiments, 240 ewes were divided into 8 treatment groups and drenched weekly (at an amount equal to their summed daily intake) for one year, including during gestation and early lactation, with no Se (deficient); at recommended levels (0. 3 mg/kg) with inorganic sodium selenite, sodium selenate, or organic Se-yeast (Se-Y); or at supranutritional levels (0. 9 and 1. 5 mg/kg) with sodium selenite or Se yeast. In the third experiment, 88 ewes continued the study into year two for an additional 28 weeks. Year two treatments included no Se (deficient) ewes (n = 25); ewes supplemented at recommended levels (0. 3 mg/kg) with organic Se-Y (n = 20); ewes supplemented at supranutritional levels (0. 9 and 1. 5 mg/kg) with organic Se-Y (n = 18 and 27, respectively). In the first experiment, which assessed the effects of Se source and supplementation rate in ewes on Se status of their offspring, we found that Se administered by weekly drenching of ewes during gestation and early lactation was effective at increasing Se concentrations in ewe colostrum and milk at 30 days in milk (DIM), and in improving the Se status of lambs (whole-blood and serum Se at birth, and skeletal-muscle Se at 14 days of age) (all P 0. 05). In summary, weekly <b>oral</b> <b>drenching</b> of ewes with Se yeast during gestation and early lactation was found to be an effective method for improving Se status of their newborn lambs. In the second experiment, which examined the effects of Se source and supplementation rate in ewes on colostral IgG and lamb serum-IgG concentrations, we measured colostral and lamb serum-IgG concentrations at parturition, and lamb serum-IgG concentration again at 48 hours postnatal. Although Se drenching of ewes was effective at increasing whole-blood Se concentrations in ewes and lambs (P 0. 05) irrespective of Se source, or supplementation rate. Therefore, we conclude that Se supplementation in ewes, and the Se status of newborn lambs, have little effect on IgG concentrations in colostrum and subsequent IgG concentrations in lamb serum at 48 hours postnatal. The purpose of the third experiment was to examine the effect of Se source and supplementation rate on ewe reproductive performance and subsequent vitality and growth performance of lambs, over two consecutive lambing seasons. In year one, lambing percent; number of lambs born per ewe; lamb birth weights; 90 - and 120 -day BW and ADG; and pounds of lamb weaned per ewe were measured. The purpose of the second year {{of this study was to}} continue our observations for the SeY treated ewes, adding additional parameters to monitor ewe reproductive performance (percentage of ewes exhibiting estrus; percentage of ewes exhibiting estrus that lambed; percentage of ewes lambing; and number of lambs born per ewe). Year two lamb performance measures included birth weights; neonatal vigor scores; 10 -, 20 -, and 60 -day BW and ADG; and percentage of lambs surviving to 60 days. In year one, Se supplementation, regardless of supplementation rate, did not affect lambing percent, number of lambs born per ewe, lamb birth weights, 90 -day BW and ADG, or pounds of lamb weaned per ewe. However, lambs from ewes in the 1. 5 mg/kg SeY group had greater 120 -day BW (P = 0. 10) and ADG (P = 0. 06) than lambs from ewes in the 0. 3 mg/kg group. This same trend was apparent in a subgroup of lambs from Suffolk ewes receiving Se at 1. 5 mg/kg that had greater 120 -day BW (P = 0. 07) and ADG (P = 0. 09) compared to lambs receiving SeY at 0. 3 mg/kg. Similarly, a subgroup of lambs reared as twins from ewes receiving Se at 1. 5 mg/kg had greater 120 -day BW (P = 0. 07) and ADG (P = 0. 08) than lambs reared as twins from ewes in the 0. 3 mg/kg group. In year two, there were two ewe reproductive performance measures that were negatively affected by Se supplementation. First, the percentage of ewes exhibiting estrus that lambed in the 0. 3 mg/kg SeY group (75...|$|R
