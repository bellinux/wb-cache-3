500|$|Raptor Red was favorably {{received}} by critics and the mainstream press. Much praise {{was given to}} Bakker's anthropomorphising of the dinosaurs; a reviewer for the Toronto Star said that [...] "Raptor Red does for dinosaurs what some nature writing does for creatures alive today: it turns data into stories. And stories are what all <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>need</b> to make these animals—even dinosaurs—come alive." [...] Mark Nichols of Maclean's said that Bakker's success lay in making the reader hope that the dinosaurs were indeed creatures as Bakker portrayed.|$|E
500|$|Several critics {{found the}} lack of an {{anthropomorphic}} point of view hurt the book's relevance. Robert Braile in The Boston Globe wrote that it has [...] "no real context ... no rationale for probing this fantasy other than [...] unsubstantiated premise that people find it fascinating". Michael Grunwald in The Washington Post also questioned the premise: [...] "Imagining the human footprint on a post-human planet might be fun for dormitory potheads who have already settled the questions of God's existence and Fergie's hotness, but it's not clear why the rest <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>need</b> this level of documentary evidence". On the other hand, Alanna Mitchell in the Globe and Mail review found relevance in the context of society's passiveness to resource depletion combined with an anthropomorphic vanity. She writes the [...] "book [...] designed to help us find the how of survival by shaking us out of our passive dance with death".|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} 1977 Aldeburgh Festival, Imogen became seriously ill {{with what she}} {{described}} as [...] "a coronary angina". Thereafter, angina was a recurrent problem, although she continued to work and fulfil engagements. By early 1984 the deterioration in her health was noticeable to her friends. She died at home of heart failure on 9 March 1984 and was buried in Aldeburgh churchyard five days later in a plot next to Britten's. An obituary tribute in the magazine Early Music emphasised her long association with music in the Aldeburgh church, where she [...] " [...] iridescently to life facets of that tradition to which her own life had been dedicated and which she presented as a continuing source of strength and wonder". [...] Ursula Vaughan Williams wrote: [...] "Imogen had something of the medieval scholar about her... content with few creature comforts if there was enough music, enough work, enough books to fill her days. Indeed, she always filled her days, making twenty-four hours contain what most <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>need</b> twice that time to do".|$|E

[...] (from her last column) ...|$|R
5000|$|Duff McKagan credits Arkeen with {{teaching}} him about alternate tuning on guitar. Slash stated that Arkeen was [...] "the {{only one that}} always came through when any <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>needed</b> anything; {{for a long time}} he literally was the only one we could trust" [...] The Guns N' Roses album Live Era: '87-'93 was dedicated, in part, to his memory.|$|R
5000|$|At {{her public}} {{memorial}} at Parliament's Old Assembly chamber, Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane remembered her with these words: 'Dene said {{that every one}} <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>needs</b> to be accountable to our conscience, to our country, to our Constitution and to our constituency. I would be brave {{enough to say that}} no one South African held up to these standards as much as she did.' ...|$|R

60|$|St. Severinus, again, whom I have {{mentioned}} to {{you more than}} once:--none of us can believe {{that he made a}} dead corpse (Silvinus the priest, by name) sit up and talk with him on its road to burial. None <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>need</b> believe that he stopped the plague at Vienna by his prayers. None <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>need</b> attribute to anything but his sagacity the Divine revelations whereby he predicted the destruction of a town for its wickedness, and escaped thence, like Lot, alone; or by which he discovered, during the famine of Vienna, that a certain rich widow had much corn hidden in her cellars: but there are facts enough, credible and undoubted, concerning St. Severinus, the apostle of Austria, to make us trust that in him, too, wisdom was justified of all her children.|$|E

'I {{wish you}} would {{remember}} it at all times,' said Eva, 'and then, perhaps, none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>need</b> have been here;' and then not waiting for his reply, she addressed herself to Baroni.

40|$|Relationship with one’s {{partner is}} one of the most {{important}} interpersonal relationships during a person’s lifetime. The majority of people are born into a relationship or live in one for at least a part of their lives, either as a partner or a child. People often have major expectations for a relationship. On the other hand, there are people who do not want to be in a relation-ship and consider their lives good without one. However, every one <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>needs</b> other people. Living alone is not a problem, but loneliness might be...|$|R

60|$|In the {{beginning}} of this dialogue, Clennam had expected some great harmless outburst from Mr Meagles, like that which had made him burst out of the Circumlocution Office, holding Doyce by the collar. But his good friend had a weakness which none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>need</b> go into the next street to find, and which no amount of Circumlocution experience could long subdue in him. Clennam looked at Doyce; but Doyce knew all about it beforehand, and looked at his plate, and made no sign, and said no word.|$|E

"Well, Pengarvan, {{whether you}} or I be right, we may congratulate ourselves; for {{we have made}} a near cast, indeed, seeing that it is eight weeks since we left England, and more than six since we sailed out of sight of Madeira; and that we traversed a sea {{altogether}} strange to us, and of whose currents we know nothing.

60|$|Your Webster {{is not my}} Webster; nor your Herrick my Herrick. On {{these matters}} we must fire a gun to leeward, show our colours, and go by. Argument is impossible. They are two of my {{favourite}} authors: Herrick above all: I suppose they are two of yours. Well, Janus-like, they do behold us two with diverse countenances, few features are common to these different avatars; and we can but agree to differ, but still with gratitude to our entertainers, like two guests at the same dinner, one of whom takes clear and one white soup. By my way of thinking, neither <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>need</b> be wrong.|$|E

50|$|This {{collection}} of three stories under a joint name The Black Pearl {{is based on}} author's notes from traveling around Italy. Each of the characters met by the author tells her a moving history {{of his or her}} life. When talking to the author they experience a particular catharsis: a spiritual and emotional cleanse, they release emotions, they seem to want to tame the sometimes pointless chaos of their lives. The need to confide stems from the internal need of sorting one’s thoughts. Each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>needs</b> understanding and affection. All of these stories are naturally brought to order by life which puts them into a coherent wholeness.|$|R

50|$|Thus for Marx, liberal {{rights and}} ideas of justice are {{premised on the}} idea that each <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>needs</b> {{protection}} from other human beings. Therefore, liberal rights are rights of separation, designed to protect us from such perceived threats. Freedom on such a view, is freedom from interference. What this view denies is the possibility — according to Marx, the fact — that real freedom is to be found positively in our relations with other people. It {{is to be found in}} human community, not in isolation. So insisting on a regime <b>of</b> rights encourages <b>us</b> to view each other in ways which undermine the possibility of the real freedom we may find in human emancipation.|$|R

Then, when you join me at dusk, one of you can walk a mile or two along the road; the other twice as far.

60|$|Poor Belle! Poor shamed, deserted woman! She was an evil-doer, and the {{fatality}} of {{love and}} the unbalanced vigour of her mind, which might, had she been more happily placed, have led her to all things that are pure, and true, and of good report, combined to drag her into shame and wretchedness. But the evil that she did was paid back to her in full measure, pressed down and running over. Few <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>need</b> {{to wait for a}} place of punishment to get the due of our follies and our sins. /Here/ we expiate them. They are with us day and night, about our path and about our bed, scourging us with the whips of memory, mocking us with empty longing and the hopelessness of despair. Who can escape the consequence of sin, or even of the misfortune which led to sin? Certainly Belle did not, nor Mr. Quest, nor even that fierce-hearted harpy who hunted him to his grave.|$|E
60|$|The {{days are}} over in England of that strange {{religion}} of king-worship, when priests flattered princes in the Temple of God; when servility was held to be ennobling duty; when beauty and youth tried eagerly for royal favour; and woman’s shame was held to be no dishonour. Mended morals and mended manners in Courts and people, are among the priceless consequences of the freedom which George I came to rescue and secure. He kept his compact with his English subjects; and if he escaped no more than other men and monarchs from the vices of his age, at least we may thank him for preserving and transmitting the liberties of ours. In our free air, royal and humble homes have alike been purified; and Truth, the birthright {{of high and low}} among us, which quite fearlessly judges our greatest personages, can only speak of them now in words of respect and regard. There are stains in the portrait of the first George, and traits in it which none <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>need</b> admire; but, among the nobler features are justice, courage, moderation—and these we may recognize ere we turn the picture to the wall.|$|E
