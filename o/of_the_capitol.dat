5|$|A {{more modest}} bicentennial rededication {{occurred}} on September 18, 1993, organized by Architect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> George White. (After his appointment as Architect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol,</b> White {{had been made}} a Mason-at-Sight, a rarely used mode of initiation in which a Grand Master instantly raises a non-Mason {{to the degree of}} Master Mason.) The 1993 ceremony was attended by the Grand Masters of each of the 50 grand lodges in the United States. At the time, White announced a tricentennial observance to occur on Friday, September 18, 2093.|$|E
5|$|After thirty-four {{hours of}} lying in state, the doors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> were {{closed to the}} public and Nancy Reagan was escorted in, where she had a moment alone with the casket. A {{military}} honor guard entered and carried it down the west steps <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> to a 21-gun salute where Nancy, holding her hand over her heart, met it. After it was placed in a hearse, the motorcade departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse made its way.|$|E
5|$|The {{ground was}} broken for the Huston Capitol on November 2, 1902, but the {{cornerstone}} was not laid until May 5, 1904. Ownership <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitol</b> was {{handed over to}} the state government on August 15, 1906, and the Capitol Building Commission was dissolved.|$|E

50|$|Due to <b>the</b> {{restoration}} process <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State <b>Capitol</b> {{taking place}} since 2014, the Senate held floor sessions in 2016 in the Minnesota Senate Building, {{an office building}} across <b>the</b> street north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State <b>Capitol.</b> It was <b>the</b> first time the Senate held a regular session outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> State <b>Capitol</b> since its opening in 1905.|$|R
50|$|He {{moved to}} Washington, D.C. in 1971, {{to work as}} a {{research}} fellow at what became <b>the</b> Smithsonian Museum <b>of</b> American Art. As curator <b>of</b> <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Capitol,</b> 1976-1980, he oversaw restoration <b>of</b> four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> massive paintings in the Rotunda, and conserved hundreds of architectural drawings by Thomas U. Walter, architect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol's</b> dome.|$|R
5|$|Workers began {{excavating}} {{the foundations}} of the United States Capitol in July 1793. During construction of the foundation, building commissioner David Stuart wrote to other members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitol</b> commission suggesting a cornerstone ceremony be held. At their September 2 meeting, the commission agreed with Stuart, setting a date for the ceremony {{a little more than two}} weeks later.|$|E
5|$|After the eulogies, {{the three}} {{speakers}} each laid a wreath at the casket, and the Senate Chaplain, the Reverend Barry Black, gave the benediction. Cheney escorted Nancy Reagan to the casket, where {{she said her}} goodbyes. The dignitaries in the room paid their respects during the next half-hour. In a rare instance, the doors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> were then opened to the public, who stood in lines stretching many blocks to view the casket.|$|E
5|$|Also {{attributable}} to Gasparo Cairano, and dated at this stage, is the singular St John the Baptist {{placed in the}} tympanum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitol</b> of the eponymous Abbey in Parma. The work, undocumented and traditionally attributed by critics to Antonio Ferrari d'Agrate, was assigned in 2010 to the catalog {{of the works of}} Cairano due to obvious correlation with the mature art of the artist. This spread of Gasparo's artistic reach is significant and demonstrates that he could prove a success even outside of Brescia.|$|E

50|$|Delays wracked <b>the</b> {{construction}} efforts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol's</b> builders, notably <b>the</b> interruption by <b>the</b> War <b>of</b> 1812, {{when all}} construction {{came to a}} halt. In August 1814, the British captured <b>the</b> city <b>of</b> Washington and set fire to <b>the</b> <b>Capitol,</b> nearly destroying <b>the</b> entire building. Thus, when construction recommenced {{after the war ended}} in 1815, it was initially to rebuild what had been lost to the fire.|$|R
5|$|Although Brunner died on February 14, 1925, {{elements}} of his plans were still completed, {{except for his}} People's Court, which became a parking lot. Brunner planned a bridge to cross the railroad tracks and connect the capitol with the highest point in the city at 13thStreet. Brunner had also originally planned to have another bridge span the Susquehanna River, {{on the west side}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitol.</b> After his death, parts of the bridge were redesigned and became the current State Street Bridge, which was completed in 1930. The Education Building, or Forum Building, was completed in 1931.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{creation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> Loop, M-143 and Michigan Avenue in Lansing was partially transferred back to local control. The section between Cedar and Larch streets was retained {{as part of the}} new Capitol Loop and the remainder inside the city of Lansing was removed from the state trunkline highway system on October 13, 1989. At the time, M-143 in the City of East Lansing was not transferred, and MDOT removed the signage, creating an unsigned trunkline.|$|E
5|$|Huston {{designed}} the large bronze {{doors at the}} capitol's main entrance. They were modeled by sculptor Otto Jahnsen and were both cast in one piece using the lost wax method of casting by the Henry Bonnard Bronze Company. The doors are decorated with scenes {{from the history of}} Pennsylvania, such as the arrival of William Penn and his peace treaty with the Lenape. Busts of people who were important in the construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitol,</b> like Governor Pennypacker, Boies Penrose, and Matthew Quay, decorate the edges of the doors. The bust of Huston hides the doors' keyhole.|$|E

On 14 April 2009, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce awarded Harrison a star on the Walk of Fame in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> Records Building. McCartney, Lynne and Petty were present when the star was unveiled. Harrison's widow Olivia, the actor Tom Hanks and Idle made speeches at the ceremony, and Harrison's son Dhani spoke the Hare Krishna mantra.|$|E
5|$|The 6th Massachusetts reached Washington D.C. on April 19, 1861, {{the first}} unit {{to arrive in}} {{response}} to Lincoln's call for troops. A large, cheering crowd welcomed them at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Station which once stood north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol.</b> Among the crowd was Clara Barton who became a famed nurse during the Civil War. At the time a clerk in the U.S. Patent Office, Barton gained her first experience in caring for wounded soldiers as she tended to injured men of the 6th Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|The National Archives houses {{thousands}} of documents important to American history including the Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. Located in three buildings on Capitol Hill, the Library of Congress {{is the largest}} library complex {{in the world with}} a collection of over 147million books, manuscripts, and other materials. The United States Supreme Court Building was completed in 1935; before then, the court held sessions in the Old Senate Chamber <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{the speeches}} Lieutenant-General Philip Sheridan led a procession, which {{included}} the dignitaries and the crowd, past the Executive Mansion, now the White House, then via Pennsylvania Avenue to the east main entrance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol,</b> where President Arthur received passing troops. Then, in the House Chamber, the president, his Cabinet, diplomats and others listened to Representative John Davis Long read a speech written {{a few months earlier}} by Robert C. Winthrop, formerly the Speaker of the House of Representatives when the cornerstone was laid 37 years earlier, but now too ill to personally deliver his speech. A final speech was given by John W. Daniel of Virginia. The festivities concluded that evening with fireworks, both aerial and ground displays.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1964, {{however, the}} Kingston Trio's {{dominance}} in record sales and concert bookings began to wane, due partly to imitators in the pop-folk world {{and also to}} the rise of other commercial folk groups like Peter, Paul and Mary. The British Invasion spearheaded by The Beatles, who were signed by EMI/Capitol just as the Trio's seven-year contract was running out, depressed sales of acoustic folk albums significantly, and Capitol did not make a serious effort to re-sign the group. Werber secured a generous signing bonus from Decca Records, and the last four albums of the Kingston Trio's first decade were released by that label. Without the production facilities of Capitol, however, and the expertise of Voyle Gilmore and engineer Pete Abbott, the Decca releases lacked the aural brilliance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> albums, and none of the four sold especially well.|$|E
5|$|From 1912 to 1917, {{the state}} {{acquired}} {{all of the}} 541separate properties that comprise the Eighth Ward east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>capitol.</b> The Eighth Ward was situated between the capitol {{and a set of}} railroad tracks, then owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Arnold Brunner was hired in 1916 to develop new accommodations for state government, which had already outgrown the capitol. He introduced his plan in 1920, which called, first, for the demolition of the Eighth Ward. Brunner planned two office buildings behind the capitol, the North and South Office Buildings, and these were separated by a courtyard he named the People's Court. The South Office Building was completed in 1921. The leveling of the Eighth Ward was finished in 1925.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s passenger-rail groups urged Amtrak {{to extend the}} Pennsylvanian to Cleveland, Ohio. Proposals {{included}} new stations in Sewickley and Beaver Falls. Pressure increased in 1989 when Amtrak announced the re-routing of the Broadway Limited and Capitol Limited over that same route {{as part of a}} restructuring of routes in Indiana. As part of this change, the Capitol Limited began serving the ClevelandPittsburgh route, albeit {{in the middle of the}} night. Amtrak and PennDOT considered two routes for an extended Pennsylvanian: one via Alliance, Ohio (following the route <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol</b> Limited) and one via Youngstown, Ohio (partially following the Broadway Limited) with a new stop in New Castle, Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|Judah Benjamin {{was sworn}} in as senator from Louisiana on March 4, 1853, at a brief meeting called just prior to President Pierce's inauguration. These new colleagues {{included}} Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia, and Sam Houston of Texas. The slavery issue was in a brief remission as much of the country wished to accept the Compromise of 1850 as a final settlement. When the Senate was not in session, Benjamin remained in Washington, D.C., conducting a lucrative practice including many cases before the Supreme Court, then conveniently located in a room <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Capitol.</b> His law partners in New Orleans took care of his firm's affairs there. About this time Benjamin sold his interest in Bellechasse, lacking the time to deal with plantation business.|$|E
