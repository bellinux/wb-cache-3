5|$|These flights covered {{performance}} tests {{such as we}} do <b>on</b> <b>planes</b> undergoing Navy tests. The very first flight exposed weaknesses of the Zero which our pilots could exploit with proper tactics... immediately apparent {{was the fact that}} the ailerons froze up at speeds above 200 knots so that rolling maneuvers at those speeds were slow and required much force on the control stick. It rolled to the left much easier than to the right. Also, its engine cut out under negative acceleration due to its float-type carburetor. We now had the answer for our pilots who were being outmaneuvered and unable to escape a pursuing Zero: Go into a vertical power dive, using negative acceleration if possible to open the range while the Zero's engine was stopped by the acceleration. At about 200 knots, roll hard right before the Zero pilot could get his sights lined up.|$|E

Mobile phone use during flights used to be prohibited and many airlines still claim in their in-plane announcements that this prohibition is due to possible interference with aircraft radio communications. Shut-off mobile phones do not interfere with aircraft avionics. The recommendation why phones should not be used during take-off and landing, even <b>on</b> <b>planes</b> that allow calls or messaging, is so that passengers pay attention to the crew for any possible accident situations, as most aircraft accidents happen on take-off and landing.|$|E
40|$|Abstract To {{assess the}} thermo-mechanical {{behavior}} of shape memory alloys and analyzing these special materials, a simple constitutive integrated model, named micro-plane, is proposed. The model deals with shear and normal <b>on</b> <b>plane</b> stress/strain components and also <b>on</b> <b>plane</b> shear orientation as well. The proposed simple model {{is capable of}} predicting three-dimensional behavior as the superposition of <b>on</b> <b>plane</b> elastic and inelastic deformations. In the case of static constraint, two <b>on</b> <b>plane</b> stress/strain components and corresponding orientations could be obtained by transferring the stress/strain tensor. Then to calculate the <b>on</b> <b>plane</b> deformations, a plane constitutive law is needed to assess unknown strains/stresses. To represent the capability of this model, the predicted different test data across time and temperature domains are compared with the experimental results. In these test results the shape memory alloys behavior as: super elasticity under various temperatures, loading rate effects, asymmetry in tension and pressure, various loops of loading and unloading, hydrostatic pressure effects, different proportional tension-shear biaxial loading and unloading and also deviation from normality due to non-proportional tension-shear biaxial loading and unloading, are investigated and presented. The interesting well accuracy of results proves the strength and capability of th...|$|R

[...] There is little opportunity to judge whether a passenger is violent. [...] As for the argument that the kirpan could encourage other students to bring weapons to school, as defence against the kirpan, the Court replied this was speculative. [...] Of relation to this concern was the worry that the school atmosphere would be negatively affected. [...] The Court replied it was untrue that the kirpan represented violence, and that it had religious meanings instead. [...] The Court also found this theory could be offensive to Sikhs and would thus contradict multiculturalism. [...] If some students feel it is unfair that the claimant can wear a kirpan to school while they cannot carry knives, the Court suggested schools should teach these students the importance of freedom of religion.|$|E
