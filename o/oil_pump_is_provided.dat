40|$|Abstract. The fluid {{noise of}} rotor <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> studied in this paper, and the {{turbulent}} and flow sound field model of rotor <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>are</b> built. Based on CFD software, three dimensional unsteady internal flow field numerical simulation of some type rotor <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> carried out. And, the velocity and pressure simulation results at different speeds are obtained. Based on acoustic finite element and infinite element method, CFD software and acoustic solver software {{are used to}} simulate the flow induced noise of rotor <b>oil</b> <b>pump.</b> And, the sound pressure level values of monitor points in the <b>pump</b> <b>are</b> obtained. This paper puts forward some methods to reduce noise which has been verified by the experiment result effectively...|$|R

50|$|Conventional {{wet sump}} engines have one <b>oil</b> <b>pump.</b> It <b>is</b> {{generally}} located inside {{the lower part}} of the engine, usually below and/or to one side of the crankshaft. On dry sump engines, at least two <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> required: one to pressurize and distribute the oil around the engine components, and at least one other 'scavenge pump' to evacuate the oil which has pooled at the bottom of the engine. This scavenge <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> sometimes (but not always) located in the 'sump' of the engine, and crucially, this scavenge pump's flow-rate capacity must exceed that of the pump which pressurizes and distributes oil throughout the engine.|$|R
25|$|Tarakan's oilfields were swiftly {{repaired}} {{and brought}} back into production. Engineers and technicians arrived shortly after the Allied landing and the first <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> restored on 27 June. By October the island's oilfields were producing 8,000 barrels per day and providing employment for many Tarakanese civilians.|$|R
50|$|The {{transformer}} oil was carried through cooling tubes located {{on both sides}} under the centre locomotive body. An <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> used to circulate the oil. Each cooling tube system was mounted inside a duct. A fan blew air from {{the interior of the}} body through this system.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine oil}} system {{is of the}} dry sump type, a {{combined}} pressure and scavenge <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> driven by the inlet camshaft gear, later versions of the T140 employed additional integral non-return valves to prevent oil draining into the sump. The frame of the T140 serves as the engine oil reservoir.|$|R

50|$|The DT200R shares similar engine {{cases with}} the ATV BLASTER - But the Blaster is not crank case {{induction}} like the DT200R. Both DT200R & Blaster crank shafts are compatible, the DT200R piston doesn't have port's like the Blaster, but the Blaster piston {{can be used}} with the DT200R. In the Blaster version & some of the DT200WR versions the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> not installed, blanking plug is fitted over the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> drive.|$|R
25|$|Commonly {{interlocks}} {{are added}} to a control circuit. Suppose that the motor in the example is powering machinery that has a critical need for lubrication. In this case an interlock could be added {{to insure that the}} <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> running before the motor starts. Timers, limit switches and electric eyes are other common elements in control circuits.|$|R
50|$|A {{wet sump}} offers the {{advantage}} of a simple design, using a single pump and no external reservoir. Since the sump is internal, {{there is no need for}} hoses or tubes connecting the engine to an external sump which may leak. An internal <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> generally more difficult to replace, but that is dependent on the engine design.|$|R

50|$|In 2-stroke {{crankcase}} scavenged engines, {{the interior}} of the crankcase, and therefore the crankshaft, connecting rod and bottom of the pistons are sprayed by the 2-stroke oil in the air-fuel-oil mixture which is then burned along with the fuel. The valve train may be contained in a compartment flooded with lubricant so that no <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> required.|$|R
50|$|To boost US sales the AMC {{marketing}} team rebranded the ageing export Model 16 {{with the}} new name The Sceptre with new metal tank badges and steel flywheels instead of the old cast iron ones. The compression ratio was also raised to 9:1 and the competition also Norton designed geared <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> also fitted as standard.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, another model known as Oil King was also {{launched}} which featured an <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> for the 2T mix with petrol but later production ceased. The prominent protrusion {{of the left}} hand side gearbox housing was the original location for the pump. Though the model was discontinued the engine casing {{found its way into}} the Road King and hence all Road Kings have this protrusion even though the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> not housed there anymore.|$|R
40|$|Â <b>Oil</b> {{viscosity}} <b>pumps</b> <b>are</b> {{typically used}} for reciprocating compressors in household refrigerators to lubricate the compression mechanism. The <b>oil</b> viscosity <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> a simple structure {{in which a}} spiral groove is on the shaft surface. The lubricating oil supplied by this pump has a large influence on the performance and reliability, but the <b>oil</b> viscosity <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> designed based on the experience. We investigated the flow characteristics of the <b>oil</b> viscosity <b>pump</b> from theoretical and experimental study. We performed the study {{based on the assumption}} that the oil flow inside spiral groove was steady with two-dimensional viscous flow. As a result, we found that the pressure-flow rate (P-Q) characteristics has a linear relationship when the length of the spiral grooves, the rotational speed of the shaft, and the depth of the spiral grooves are in the limited area...|$|R
500|$|... 24 {{compressor}} {{stations were}} constructed along the pipeline with centrifugal compressors, increasing {{the capacity of}} the system to [...] of gas a day, and the old <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> <b>were</b> retained for reuse in a future crisis. Steel valves replaced the older, less reliable cast iron designs. Demand continued to increase, requiring additional compressor capability, and by January 1949 the pipelines were moving [...] a day.|$|R
50|$|Although it {{appeared}} that the basic design was able to deliver its promised performance, at that point it was far from a complete design. Weight and fuel consumption were both above the design estimates, the various support systems like fuel and <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> <b>were</b> not self-contained, and it remained susceptible to compressor surging. Flader estimated that these problems would require another three years of development to fix.|$|R

5000|$|During 1963, Allis-Chalmers {{announced}} that ConEd {{had ordered the}} [...] "world’s first MILLION-KILOWATT unit...big enough to serve 3,000,000 people." [...] This sheer scale helped the plant become popularly known as [...] "Big Allis". During the 1965 black-out the bearings of the Allis-Chalmers Turbine were damaged. The lube <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> <b>were</b> {{hooked up to the}} electrical grid, thus shutting them down during the blackout and causing bearing damage.|$|R
50|$|Starting {{out with}} the {{production}} and distribution of die-casting products, Zama developed into the world’s largest manufacturer of diaphragm carburetors and sells further products nowadays. Zama's first carburetor was produced in 1975, {{and the production of}} <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> <b>was</b> initiated in 2003. Further milestones for Zama were the production of their first electronic carburetor in 2009 and the production of their first solenoid valve in 2016.|$|R
5000|$|The fuel {{consumption}} figure of [...] has {{been attributed to}} the low number of moving parts in the engine: The <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> driven by the balance shaft, while the camshaft also drives the water pump. [...] The design also resulted in water hoses that are 30% shorter. [...] The pistons are resin-coated and lightweight aluminum material is used for the friction-reducing roller rocker arm.|$|R

5000|$|During {{the morning}} of Friday 25 September 1998, a pump {{supplying}} heated lean oil to heat exchanger GP905 in Gas Plant No. 1 went offline for four hours, due {{to an increase in}} flow from the Marlin Gas Field which caused an overflow of condensate in the absorber. (The plant was complex and the hot <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> only one component involved in the accident process; why the <b>pump</b> shutdown <b>is</b> complicated and important.) ...|$|R
50|$|There is {{a common}} oiling problem with the pre-1992 R32 RB26 motors, as the surface where the {{crankshaft}} meets the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> machined too small, eventually leading to <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> failure at high rpm. This issue was resolved in later versions of the RB26 with a wider <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> drive. Aftermarket performance parts makers also make <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> extension drive collars to rectify this problem. More recently a spline drive solution has been developed by an aftermarket tuner Supertec Racing who {{moves away from the}} OEM flat drive system and uses splines to drive the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> gears {{in the same way as}} Toyota's 1JZ GTE engine as found in the Supra MKIII. This kit is available for most uprated RB26 <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> including Nissans own OEM, N1 and Nismo.|$|R
40|$|The engine {{lubrication}} {{system is a}} vital element for engine health but causes a parasitic load on the engine which increases the fuel consumption: this load can be reduced by matching the oil flow to lubricating requirements using a variable displacement <b>oil</b> <b>pump.</b> In a first stage, two variable displacement <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> <b>were</b> installed on a 2. 4 -L diesel engine; experiments over the New European Drive cycle showed reductions in fuel consumption of up to 3. 4 % and up to 5. 8 % over the urban phase of the cycle. A variable displacement <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> subsequently installed on an instrumented engine capturing over 100 metal and fluid temperatures within the engine structure. This showed that reducing oil flows resulted in lower oil temperature by up to 4 C during cold-start New European Drive cycle but hotter cylinder liner temperatures by up to 6 C. The higher cylinder wall temperatures caused an increase of 3 % in oxides of nitrogen emissions but a reduction of 3 %– 5 % in carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. Finally, an energy flow analysis showed that the variable displacement <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> can reduce <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> energy consumption by 160 kJ (32 %) but that {{this led to a}} 400 -kJ reduction in friction and accessory work. These findings highlight the need for a system-level rather than a component-level approach to engine lubrication design to capture key thermal interactions...|$|R
50|$|Class 11 {{vehicles}} {{typically have}} 60-80 horsepower. Single Carburated, dual or single port. Electronic ignitions are allowed. No dry sumps. Larger <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> may <b>be</b> installed, and external coolers as well.|$|R
5000|$|The oil {{pressure}} idiot light lights when engine {{oil pressure}} drops below a predetermined level. The light normally appears when the vehicle ignition is turned on, but the engine is not running, as it detects no oil pressure due to the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> not operating (the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> powered off the crankshaft, so only operates when the engine is running). It normally turns off a few seconds after engine start as the <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> starts working and building up oil pressure. This tell-tale can bear the legend [...] or a pictogram of an oil can. Some cars illuminate the light red or yellow, depending on the action needed to be taken.|$|R
25|$|The Griffon 61 series {{introduced}} a two-stage supercharger and other design changes: the pressure <b>oil</b> <b>pumps</b> <b>were</b> now housed internally within the sump and an {{effort was made}} to remove as many external pipes as possible. In addition, the drive for the supercharger was taken from the crankshaft {{at the back of the}} engine, via a short torsion shaft, rather than from the front of the engine, using a long drive shaft as used by earlier Griffon variants.|$|R
50|$|Coolant {{passages}} {{were located}} between the cylinders. The gerotor-type <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>was</b> {{located at the}} bottom rear of the engine, and provided oil to both the crankshaft main bearings and the cylinder heads (via the lifters and pushrods, {{as opposed to a}} drilled passage on LA engines). Chrysler's engineers also redesigned the oil seals on the crankshaft to improve anti-leak seal performance. The oil pan was also made from thicker steel, and was installed with a more leak-resistant silicone-rubber gasket.|$|R

50|$|The SOHC EJ Subaru boxer engines were non-interference engines through 1995, run by {{a single}} timing belt driving both cams (both sides of the engine) and the water <b>pump.</b> Because they <b>are</b> non-interference engines, if the timing belt fails, the engine of the models up to 1995 will not <b>be</b> damaged. The <b>oil</b> <b>pump</b> <b>is</b> driven {{directly}} from the crank shaft and the waterpump by the timing belt. All DOHC and 1998-up SOHC EJ engines are interference engines, if the timing belt fails the valves will likely be damaged.|$|R
