40|$|Abstract The {{past decade}} has seen a growing {{interest}} in ocean sensor networks because of their wide applications in marine re-search, oceanography, ocean monitoring, offshore exploration, and defense or homeland security. Ocean sensor networks are gener-ally formed with various ocean sensors, autonomous underwater vehicles, surface stations, and research vessels. To make ocean sen-sor network applications viable, efficient communication among all devices and components is crucial. Due to the unique character-istics of underwater acoustic channels and the complex deployment environment in three dimensional (3 D) <b>ocean</b> <b>spaces,</b> new effi-cient and reliable communication and networking protocols are needed in design of ocean sensor networks. In this paper, we aim to {{provide an overview of}} the most recent advances in network design principles for 3 D ocean sensor networks, with focuses on de-ployment, localization, topology design, and position-based routing in 3 D <b>ocean</b> <b>spaces.</b> Key words <b>ocean</b> sensor networks; underwater sensor networks; three-dimensional sensor networks; ocean applications; 3 D de-ployment; topology design; localization; position-based routing...|$|R

What was agreed was that the jurisdictional boundaries of individual states were to be enlarged to 200 nautical miles off a state’s coastline. Coastal states were given greater rights to control these areas for protective purposes and the exploitation of natural resources. In total 38 million square nautical miles of <b>ocean</b> <b>space</b> was put under jurisdiction under the Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ) and the legalities concerning the continental shelf and territorial sea were altered.|$|E

50|$|Only about 2% {{of known}} marine species inhabit the pelagic environment. This {{means that they}} live in the water column as opposed to the benthic organisms that live in or on the sea floor. Deep-sea organisms {{generally}} inhabit bathypelagic (1000-4000m deep) and abyssopelagic (4000-6000m deep) zones. However, characteristics of deep-sea organisms, such as bioluminescence {{can be seen in the}} mesopelagic (200-1000m deep) zone as well. The mesopelagic zone is the disphotic zone, meaning light there is minimal but still measurable. The oxygen minimum layer exists somewhere between a depth of 700m and 1000m deep depending on the place in the ocean. This area is also where nutrients are most abundant. The bathypelagic and abyssopelagic zones are aphotic, meaning that no light penetrates this area of the ocean. These zones make up about 75% of the inhabitable <b>ocean</b> <b>space.</b>|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Oregon's {{ocean waters}} are a {{potential}} source of wind, wave, and tidal energy; of interest to renewable energy entrepreneurs and to the U.

In order to install technology to capture this energy, however, {{it may be necessary}} to mitigate conflict with existing <b>ocean</b> <b>space</b> users. The objective of this research was to construct a conflict analysis model in a GIS to answer the following research questions: (1) Within the study area off the coast of Oregon, where are stakeholders currently using <b>ocean</b> <b>space</b> and how many uses overlap? (2) To what extent might existing <b>ocean</b> <b>space</b> use present potential for conflict with renewable energy development? (3) How do various types of uncertainty affect analysis results? (4) What are the implications of these findings for ecosystem based management of the ocean? All available spatial information on <b>ocean</b> <b>space</b> usage by commercial fishing, commercial non-fishing, recreational, Native American, and scientific communities was gathered. Stakeholder outreach with these communities was used to vet the collected data and allow each to contribute knowledge not previously available through GIS data clearinghouses maintained by government or interest groups.

Results showed extensive coverage and overlap of existing <b>ocean</b> <b>space</b> uses; specifically that 99. 7...|$|E

40|$|Indonesia has {{experienced}} four times paradigm {{shift in the}} implementation of {{the law of the sea}} since it declared its archipelagic state principle in 1957 through the 1957 Djuanda declaration up to now. The shifting of paradigms can be viewed as a progressive development on the implementation of the law of the sea in Indonesia. The first paradigm was <b>ocean</b> <b>space</b> paradigm which was clearly shown in the 1957 Djuanda declaration and along the way of the diplomacy efforts of Indonesia in the first (1958), the second (1960) and the third (1982) UNCLOS. The first paradigm showed how Indonesian people viewed <b>ocean</b> <b>space</b> of Indonesian archipelago as an integral part of national territory of Indonesia. The <b>ocean</b> <b>space</b> of Indonesian archipelago, however, should be filled with development activities as the implementation of the law of the sea. This has raised ocean development paradigm in 1985 as the second paradigm. Problems and constraints of ocean development faced by government of Indonesia which consists of central government, provincial government, regency government and municipal government have led to the maritime continent paradigm as the third paradigm in 1990 s. The third paradigm viewed the ocean and land space of Indonesian archipelago as a continent. By thinking so, maritime jurisdictional problems raised by the involvement of central, provincial, regency and municipal governments in Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s ocean development will be able to be solved. As a matter of fact, the appearance of the third paradigm has complicated efforts of government in socializing the implementation of the law of the sea to all government levels and to Indonesian people. For this reason, government of Indonesia in the year of 2000 formulated national ocean policy. This policy combined <b>ocean</b> <b>space,</b> ocean development and maritime continent paradigms which can be viewed as the fourth paradigm.
