5|$|A {{few years}} later, Laila {{gives birth to}} Zalmai, Rasheed's son. The Taliban has risen to power and imposed harsh rules on the Afghan population, prohibiting women from {{appearing}} in public without a male relative. There is a drought, and living conditions in Kabul become poor. Rasheed's workshop burns down, and he is forced to take jobs {{for which he is}} ill-suited. He sends Aziza to an orphanage. Laila endures a number of beatings from the Taliban when caught alone <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>in</b> attempts to visit her daughter.|$|E
5|$|Rehman {{was born}} on 14 October 1983 in Birmingham. His father is Khalid Rehman. As a child in Birmingham he played for his local Sunday league team, Kingshurst.

5|$|Al-Qassam {{concentrated}} {{his activities}} on the lower classes, setting up a night school for casual laborers and preaching to them as an imam, first in the Jerini Mosque, {{and later in the}} Istiqlal Mosque. He would seek them out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>in</b> brothels and hashish dens. His greatest following came from the landless ex-tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where purchases of agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labor policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods. Al-Qassam grew increasingly popular with northern Palestine's poorer Muslims and was frequently sought out to preach at Mawlid celebrations.|$|E

25|$|During the Victorian era, {{many of the}} old {{buildings}} were swept away and the estates broken up to form streets of terraced housing. The change from rural suburb to firmly urban, was marked by the arrival of the railway in 1850, with a great iron rail bridge crossing Mare Street. Trams began to make their appearance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>in</b> the 1870s, and a tram depot opened in 1882 on Bohemia Place.|$|E
25|$|Kvass was {{reported}} to be consumed in excess by peasants, low-class citizens, and monks; in fact, it is sometimes said that it was usual for them to drink more kvass than water. In the 19th century, the kvass industry was created and less natural versions of the drink became increasingly widespread. On the other hand, the popularity of kvass and the market competition led to the emergence of many varieties, which included herbs, fruits and berries. At that time kvass vendors called kvasnik (pl. kvasniki) were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>in</b> almost every city. They often specialized in particular kinds of kvass: strawberry kvass, apple kvass, etc.|$|E

25|$|Serbia: A small protest {{took place}} in the town of Zenta (Senta) on this day. The {{demonstration}} was organised by a local ethnic Hungarian political party. These people wanted to show their sympathy for the demonstrators in Hungary because, in their opinion, all people who peacefully demonstrate <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>in</b> Hungary had previously voted to give Hungarian citizenship to the ethnic Hungarians in the neighboring countries. Attila Juhász, the mayor of the town, said that he and his party (the Alliance of Vojvodina Hungarians), which is the most influential ethnic Hungarian party in Serbia, believe that Hungarians in Vojvodina have no business in the Hungarian events.|$|E
25|$|On 23 March 1973, the Federal Security Force, a {{paramilitary}} force {{under the}} alleged orders of Bhutto, attacked a public opposition rally at the Liaquat Bagh {{in the town}} of Rawalpindi and killed a dozen people; many more were wounded by their automatic gunfire. Wali Khan narrowly escaped a bullet during the attack. Public anger amongst ethnic Pashtuns ran high, as almost all the dead and most of the wounded were from the NWFP and were mostly members of the National Awami Party. The enraged party workers and followers wanted to parade the dead bodies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>in</b> Peshawar and other cities of the province, and provoke a full scale confrontation. Wali Khan rejected this notion and held back his infuriated party cadres, escorting the dead bodies to Peshawar; he had them buried quietly and solemnly with their bereaved families.|$|E
25|$|Emerging {{nationalism}} {{tended to}} see prostitution and venereal disease as legacies of colonialism {{that could be}} resolved through independence. This movement became linked to Catholic conservatism which demanded social purification of the pure Irish soul. Thus the 1920s saw the decline of Monto, as the Legion of Mary founded and led by Frank Duff successfully crusaded to close down the brothels of Monto and bring religion to the area. Prostitution continued {{to exist in the}} form of individual women selling sexual services <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>in</b> cities, but {{it was a long time}} before organised prostitution was seen again. However, street prostitution remained intrinsically linked to the Dublin Underworld. The 1920s and 1930s witnessed a new era Church-State morality and censorship. The Magdalene Asylums became more punitive, imprisoning young women who transgressed conventional sexual morality, some for the duration of their lives, the last asylum closing only in 1996.|$|E

25|$|The Paris {{police force}} was {{completely}} re-organized {{after the fall}} of Napoleon III and the Commune; the sergents de ville were replaced by the gardiens de la paix publique (Guardians of the Public Peace), which by June 1871 had 7,756 men under the authority of the Prefect of Police named by the national government. Following a series of anarchist bombings in 1892, the number was increased to 7,000 guardians, 80 brigadiers and 950 sous-brigadiers. In 1901, under the prefect Louis Lépine, in order {{to keep up with the}} technology of the time, a unit of policemen on bicycles (called the hirondelles after the brand of the bicycles) was formed. They numbered 18 per arrondissement and reached 600 by 1906 for the whole city. A unit of river police, the brigade fluviale, was organized in 1900 for the Universal Exposition, as well as a unit of traffic police who wore a symbol of a Roman chariot embroidered on the sleeve of their uniform. The first six motorcycle policemen appeared <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>in</b> 1906.|$|E
25|$|Her major investigative works include La noche de Tlatelolco (Massacre in Mexico) (1971), Fuerte es el silencio (Strong is Silence) (1975) and Nada nadie. Las voces del temblor (Nothing No one: The Voices of the Earthquake) (1988). The {{best known}} of these is La noche de Tlatelolco about the 1968 {{repression}} of student protests in Mexico City. She {{found out about the}} massacre on the evening of October 2, 1968, when her son was only four months old. Afterwards, Poniatowska went out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>in</b> the neighborhood and began interviewing people while there was still blood on the streets and shoes strewn about and women searching for the children who had not come home. The books contains interviews with informants, eyewitnesses, former prisoners which are interspersed with poems by Octavio Paz and Rosario Castellanos, excepts from pre Hispanic texts and newspaper as well as political slogans. Massacre in Mexico was the only book published on the subject for twenty years, contradicting the government's account of the events and the number dead. The government offered her the Xavier Villaurrutia Award in 1970 for the work but she refused it.|$|E
25|$|Among the {{principal}} causes for {{the dangers of}} the streets of London, Moreton lists the abuse of alcohol specifically geneva or gin. In the Gin Era of 1720–50 very cheap liquors were sold indiscriminately, often resulting in a debauch of spirit-drinking, whose effects were seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets,</b> <b>in</b> the workhouses, in the growing misery of the poor and in an increase of criminality and violent acts. Moreton argues that this wicked trade will be the doom of the English nation, and it represents a real threat to the entire community: suppose a man able to maintain himself and family by his trade, {{and at the same time}} to be a Geneva drinker. This fellow first makes himself incapable of working by being continually drunk; which runs him behindhand, so that he either pawns, or neglects his work, for which reason nobody will employ him. At last, fear of arrests, his own hunger, the cries of a family for bread, his natural desire to support an irregular life, and a propense hatred to labour, turn but too many an honest tradesman into an arrant desperate rogue. And these are commonly the means that furnish us with thieves and villains in general.|$|E

500|$|Those without {{firearms}} would arm {{themselves with}} rifles acquired from killed French soldiers. By January 1920, French supply convoys and communication lines were regularly coming {{under attack by}} the partisans and those Armenians who had been repatriated were being harassed and pressured {{to leave their homes}} once more. The French attempted to mollify the minority Muslim elements (Circassians, Alevis, Kurds) in Marash by creating gendarmerie units but this only emboldened the Turkish Nationalists to hoist the Turkish flag over Marash's abandoned citadel and to intimidate those Muslims who cooperated with the French. The French troops in Marash included many Algerians, and also Armenians who had been recently enlisted, and it was stated that the latter had supposedly [...] "annoyed the local population, by their arrogant attitude as they strolled <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>streets</b> <b>in</b> their French uniforms." ...|$|E
