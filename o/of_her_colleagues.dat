A joint official investigation by the United Kingdom and the United States later concluded that her fatal injuries were inflicted by a grenade thrown by one of her rescuers.

5|$|During this time, Stanton {{maintained}} a broad focus on women's rights in general rather than narrowing her focus only to female suffrage in particular. After {{passage of the}} Fifteenth Amendment in 1870 and its support by the Equal Rights Association and prominent suffragists such as Stone, Blackwell, and Howe, the gap between Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other leaders of the women's movement widened as Stanton took issue with the fundamental religious leanings of several movement leaders. Unlike many <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleagues,</b> Stanton believed organized Christianity relegated women to an unacceptable position in society. She explored this view in the 1890s in The Woman's Bible, which elucidated a feminist understanding of biblical scripture and sought to correct the fundamental sexism Stanton believed was inherent to organized Christianity. Likewise, Stanton supported divorce rights, employment rights, and property rights for women, issues in which the American Women's Suffrage Association (AWSA) preferred not to become involved.|$|E

Several Haarlem families, whether they were politically active in the NSB or not, suffered from random attacks, as the Haarlem writer Harry Mulisch described in his book De Aanslag. Haarlemmers survived during the Hunger Winter by eating tulip bulbs stored in sheds in the sandy fields around the city.|$|E
25|$|The {{morality}} arguments behind vegetarianism in Victorians England drew idealists {{from various}} causes together. Specifically, many vegetarian women identified as feminists. In her novel, Herland (1915), Charlotte Perkins Gilman desired {{to have a}} vegetarian society in her utopia. Margaret Fuller also advocated for vegetarianism in her work, Women of the Nineteenth Century (1845). She argued that when women are liberated from domestic life, they would help transform the violent male society, and vegetarianism would become the dominant diet. Frances Power Cobbe, a co-founder of the British Union for Abolition of Vivisection, identified as a vegetarian and was a well-known activist for feminism. Many <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> in the first-wave feminist movement also identified as vegetarians.|$|E

50|$|A {{good example}} of how hard it was as a woman artist on the market, is the fact, that even a revolutionary artist group like CoBrA, refused her as a member out of sexistic reasons.

25|$|On 12 June 1975, the Allahabad High Court {{declared}} Indira Gandhi's {{election to}} the Lok Sabha in 1971 void on grounds of electoral malpractice. In an election petition filed by her 1971 opponent, Raj Narain (who later on defeated her in 1977 parliamentary election from Raebareli), alleged several major as well as minor instances of using government resources for campaigning. The court ordered her stripped of her parliamentary seat and banned from running for any office for six years. According to constitution, the Prime Minister must {{be a member of}} either the Lok Sabha (the lower house in the Parliament of India) or a member of the Rajya Sabha (the upper house). Thus, this decision effectively removed her from office. Gandhi had asked one <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> in government, Mr. Ashoke Kumar Sen to defend her in court.|$|E

She fell headfirst onto a layer of ice on a frozen stream near a waterfall, landing on her back. A hole opened up in the ice and Bågenholm's head and torso were pulled in as meltwater filled her clothes. Her body became trapped under the ice, which was [...] thick. When Falkenberg and Næsheim found Bågenholm, only her feet and skis were above the ice.|$|E

In an interview published prior to the Court's decision, Ginsburg shared her view that some <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleagues</b> did not fully appreciate {{the effect of a}} strip search on a 13-year-old girl. As she pointed out, [...] "They have never been a 13-year-old girl." [...] In an 8–1 decision, the Court agreed that the school's search went too far and violated the Fourth Amendment and allowed the student's lawsuit against the school to go forward. Only Ginsburg and Justice Stevens would have allowed the student to sue individual school officials as well.|$|E

Lee disagreed with that position, but it took her almost a year {{to figure out how to}} convincingly articulate [...] "this is what Anna's journey is. No more than that. No less than that." [...] In the end, Lee successfully argued Anna's journey should be presented as a simple coming-of-age story, [...] "where she goes from having a naive view of life and love– because she's lonely– to the most sophisticated and mature view of love, where she's capable of the ultimate love, which is sacrifice." [...] Lee also had to let go of some ideas that she liked, such as a scene portraying Anna and Elsa's relationship as teenagers, which did not work because they needed to maintain the separation between Anna and Elsa.|$|E

500|$|Zinta {{has been}} the subject of several controversies. In 2003, as a witness in the Bharat Shah case, she testified against the Indian mafia.

Unlike several <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>colleagues,</b> Zinta repeated in court her earlier statement that she had received extortion threats from the mafia during the shooting of the film. After her testimony, she was given witness protection and was forced to stay out of the public eye for two months. Thirteen other witnesses before her, including celebrities Salman Khan and Shahrukh Khan, were witnesses in the case but later retracted their earlier statements. Zinta was the only witness who did not become hostile to the prosecution; the nation responded positively to her actions. Consequently, she was the first recipient of Godfrey's Mind of Steel Award at the annual Red and White Bravery Awards, given to her for the [...] "courageous act" [...] of standing against the Mumbai Underworld. On receiving the award, she said, [...] "To be brave is not to be fearless. It is when you fear and you get over it, then you can be called brave. I am human. It is not that I fear nothing. But getting over a fear is a continuous process and I have been successful so far." [...] Since 2006, Zinta {{has been the}} brand ambassador for the Godfrey Phillips Bravery awards.|$|E
