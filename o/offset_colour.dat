40|$|Colour {{vision and}} colour signals are {{important}} to aquatic animals, but light scattering and absorption by water distorts spectral stimuli. To investigate the performance of colour vision in water, and to suggest how photoreceptor spectral sensitivities and body colours might evolve for visual communication, we model the effects of changes in viewing distance and depth on the appearance of fish colours for three teleosts: a barracuda, Syphraena helleri, which is dichromatic, and two damselfishes, Chromis verater and C. hanui, which are trichromatic. We assume that photoreceptors light-adapt to the background, thereby implementing the von Kries transformation, which can largely account for colour constancy in humans and other animals, including fish. This transformation does not however compensate for light scattering over variable viewing distances, which {{in less than a}} metre seriously impairs dichromatic colour vision, and makes judgement of colour saturation unreliable for trichromats. The von Kries transformation does substantially <b>offset</b> <b>colour</b> shifts caused by changing depth, so that from depths of 0 to 30 m modelled colour changes (i. e. failures of colour constancy) are sometimes negligible. However, the magnitudes and directions of remaining changes are complex, depending upon the specific spectral sensitivities of the receptors and the reflectance spectra. This predicts that when judgement of colour is important, the spectra of signalling colours and photoreceptor spectral sensitivities should be evolutionarily linked, with the colours dependent on photoreceptor spectral sensitivities, and vice versa...|$|E

50|$|In 1968, Powell {{launched}} women's magazine POL under editor Richard Walsh, {{a founding}} co-editor of underground magazine Oz. POL was both {{the first major}} Australian women's magazine to use <b>colour</b> <b>offset</b> printing, {{and the first to}} have its issues printed overseas; this was done by the Hong Kong branch of Dai Nippon Printing before issues were air-freighted to Australia. With POL, Powell became the first client of John Singleton's Public Relations firm SPASM.|$|R
40|$|Despite their {{reputation}} as being ‘red and dead’, the unique environment inhabited by brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) can {{often lead to}} a self-regulated feedback cycle between radiatively cooling intracluster gas and star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in the BCG. However the prevalence of ‘active’ BCGs, and details of the feedback involved, are still uncertain. We have performed an optical, UV and mid-IR photometric analysis of the BCGs in 981 clusters at 0. 03 < z < 0. 5, selected from the ROSAT All Sky Survey. Using Pan-STARRS PS 1 3 π, GALEX and WISE survey data we look for BCGs with photometric colours which deviate {{from that of the}} bulk population of passive BCGs – indicative of AGN and/or star formation activity within the BCG. We find that whilst the majority of BCGs are consistent with being passive, at least 14 [*]per[*]cent of our BCGs show a significant <b>colour</b> <b>offset</b> from passivity in at least one colour index. And, where available, supplementary spectroscopy reveals the majority of these particular BCGs show strong optical emission lines. On comparing BCG ‘activity’ with the X-ray luminosity of the host cluster, we find that BCGs showing a <b>colour</b> <b>offset</b> are preferentially found in the more X-ray luminous clusters, indicative of the connection between BCG ‘activity’ and the intracluster medium...|$|R

50|$|The flag of Christmas Island {{consists}} of a green and blue background, split the top left corner to the bottom right. These colours are intended to represent the land and sea respectively. The Southern Cross constellation appears in the bottom left of the flag {{in the same manner}} as it appears on the flag of Australia. In the top right, the golden bosun bird (Phaethon lepturus fulvus, one of six races of the white-tailed tropicbird) appears. It is considered to be a symbol of the Island. The last motif appears in the centre of the flag on a golden disc is the map of the island in green. The disc itself was originally only included to <b>offset</b> the green <b>colour</b> of the map, but has become linked to the mining industry.|$|R

50|$|The journal was {{originally}} simply typed and printed by Sciences Nat {{on a small}} stencil duplicating machine which was rotated by hand with a crank. From 1974, it was produced by photocopying on a Rank Xerox machine. In 1977, a small Gestetner duplicator was obtained. During this time, pages were simply stapled together. From 1978 the typing was done on a Varityper which made it necessary to type the whole text twice. In 1979 a more advanced <b>offset</b> printer allowed <b>colours</b> printing for the first time. In 1980, 8 colour plates were produced which placed it {{at the head of}} entomological journals worldwide judged by quality of the illustrations. From 1984, the Bulletin was printed by a professional company. Each issue had from 8 (first issue) to 60 pages (double issue 75-76). Some errors also occurred: all pages of issue 80 are marked 79. Nearly all the articles were written in French, nearly all with figures, and (after 1980) most of them with colour photos.|$|R
40|$|Summary: For {{material}} to be offset printed, the masters {{need to be}} prepared as colour separations, one for each coloured ink. Production of the masters is a time consuming task, often performed by hand. A method is proposed to enable separations to be automatically prepared if the source material is available as a colour PostScript file. The method uses any black-and-white PostScript printer, and two header files, the first defining procedures to be used in preparing the separation, and the second selecting the colour of the separation desired. The method works with any colour Level 1 PostScript documents. Background <b>Offset</b> printing in <b>colour</b> is most frequently achieved by separately printing the chosen inks onto the final piece of paper. Separate plates are made up for each of the colours, and they must be carefully aligned or registered to reproduce the desired combination of colours. If you have an original illustration or manuscript in colour, the printer must manually separate the colours into the separate plates for reproduction. This is a slow and expensive process. Printers prefer to be given the originals already separated into the component colours. If you are producing the material on a computer for later reproduction by offset printing...|$|R
50|$|In 1992 Student, {{which had}} been selling for 20 pence, was dropped by the student union {{as part of a}} {{cost-cutting}} exercise. A grant of £5,000 from the University Development Fund allowed it to continue as a student society for a few years. By 1997 the newspaper was under severe financial pressure, selling only around a thousand copies a week at 20 pence each, the advertising was largely ineffective. During {{the course of the year}} the newspaper stopped publishing to avoid going into debt and a relaunch was scheduled for the start of the Autumn term with a shift towards a free distribution model. This shift resulted in a wholesale change in how the newspaper was produced. For the first time the newspaper was printed on a web <b>offset</b> press, full <b>colour</b> printing was available and the newspaper was fully produced on computers not old fashioned light boxes. The initial circulation after the relaunch was around 5,000 copies distributed through cardboard stands around the various university campuses. To ease the transition the newspaper was published on a fortnightly basis for a year. After a successful advertising funded first year the newspaper returned to being published weekly and within two years the circulation crept up to over 12,000 copies a week aided by initiatives such as a second edition catering to the other universities within Edinburgh and a seven-day TV guide.|$|R
50|$|The most {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} hornbills is the heavy bill, supported by powerful neck muscles {{as well as by}} the fused vertebrae. The large bill assists in fighting, preening, constructing the nest, and catching prey. A feature unique to the hornbills is the casque, a hollow structure that runs along the upper mandible. In some species it is barely perceptible and appears to serve no function beyond reinforcing the bill. In other species it is quite large, is reinforced with bone, and has openings between the hollow centre, allowing it to serve as a resonator for calls. In the helmeted hornbill the casque is not hollow but is filled with hornbill ivory and is used as a battering ram in dramatic aerial jousts. Aerial casque-butting has also been reported in the great hornbill.The plumage of hornbills is typically black, grey, white, or brown, and is frequently <b>offset</b> by bright <b>colours</b> on the bill, or by patches of bare coloured skin on the face or wattles. Some species exhibit sexual dichromatism; in the Abyssinian ground hornbill, for example, pure blue skin on the face and throat denotes an adult female, and red and blue skin denotes an adult male. The calls of hornbills are loud and vary distinctly between different species.Hornbills possess binocular vision, although unlike most birds with this type of vision, the bill intrudes on their visual field. This allows them to see their own bill tip and aids in precision handling of food objects with their bill. The eyes are also protected by large eyelashes which act as a sunshade.|$|R
