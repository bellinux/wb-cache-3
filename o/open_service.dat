25|$|The European Union and the European Space Agency {{agreed in}} March 2002 {{to fund the}} project, pending a review in 2003 (which was {{completed}} on 26 May 2003). The starting cost for the period ending in 2005 is estimated at €1.1billion. The required satellites (the planned number is 30) were to be launched between 2011 and 2014, with the system up and running and under civilian control from 2019. The final cost is estimated at €3billion, including the infrastructure on Earth, constructed in 2006 and 2007. The plan was for private companies and investors to invest at least two-thirds {{of the cost of}} implementation, with the EU and ESA dividing the remaining cost. The base <b>Open</b> <b>Service</b> is to be available without charge to anyone with a Galileo-compatible receiver, with an encrypted higher-bandwidth improved-precision Commercial Service available at a cost. By early 2011 costs for the project had run 50% over initial estimates.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1992 U.S. presidential {{election}} campaign, {{the civil rights}} of gays and lesbians, particularly their <b>open</b> <b>service</b> in the military, attracted some press attention, and all candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination supported ending the ban on military service by gays and lesbians, but the Republicans did not make a political issue of that position. In an August cover letter to all his senior officers, Gen. Carl Mundy, Jr., Commandant of the Marine Corps, praised a position paper authored by a Marine Corps chaplain that said that [...] "In the unique, intensely close environment of the military, homosexual conduct can threaten the lives, including the physical (e.g. AIDS) and psychological well-being of others". Mundy called it [...] "extremely insightful" [...] and said it offered [...] "a sound basis for discussion of the issue". The murder of gay U.S. Navy petty officer Allen R. Schindler, Jr. on October 27, 1992, brought calls from advocates of allowing <b>open</b> <b>service</b> by gays and lesbians for prompt action from the incoming Clinton administration.|$|E

In a June 1993 Washington Post opinion piece, Goldwater wrote: [...] "You don't have to be straight to shoot straight," [...] after Congressional phone lines were flooded by organized anti-gay opposition, indicating substantial public opposition to Clinton's <b>open</b> <b>service</b> proposal.|$|E
