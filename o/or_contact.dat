5|$|Most {{species have}} 12 ovules and 36 seeds, {{although}} some {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium have more, up {{to a maximum of}} 60. Seeds take five to six weeks to mature. The seeds of sections Jonquilla and Bulbocodium are wedge-shaped and matte black, while those of other sections are ovate and glossy black. A gust of wind <b>or</b> <b>contact</b> with a passing animal is sufficient to disperse the mature seeds.|$|E
5|$|Dental anatomy is a {{field of}} anatomy {{dedicated}} {{to the study of}} tooth structure. The development, appearance, and classification of teeth fall within its field of study, though dental occlusion, <b>or</b> <b>contact</b> between teeth, does not. Dental anatomy is also a taxonomic science as it is concerned with the naming of teeth and their structures. This information serves a practical purpose for dentists, enabling them to easily identify teeth and structures during treatment.|$|E
5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, <b>or</b> <b>contact</b> the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E

5|$|Wail al-Shehri and {{his younger}} brother Waleed were from Khamis Mushait in the Asir province, which is an impoverished area in southwestern Saudi Arabia, along the Yemeni border. Shehri was born in Annams, and grew up in the Um Saraar {{neighborhood}} in Khamis Mushait. He had ten brothers and one sister. Several of Shehri's brothers joined the Saudi military, while his uncle may have been a major in the army and director of logistics. Shehri's father, Mohammed Ali Asgley Al Shehri, worked as a car dealer. On weekends, the family often spent time together at the Red Sea. The family strictly adhered to the Wahabi school of Islam, which forbids many elements of modernity. As such, the Shehri family did not have satellite television or Internet, nor did his parents permit music <b>or</b> <b>contact</b> with girls. Some of Wail al-Shehri's elder brothers had visited the United States and could speak English; however, Wail knew little English.|$|E

25|$|Wisconsin law {{contains}} an unusual provision {{making it a}} Class F felony for a person responsible for a child {{under the age of}} 16 years such as a parent to not prevent their child from having sexual contact with another person if it was realistically possible for them to do so and they were aware that the other person intended to have sex with their child. (3) Failure to act. A person responsible for the welfare of a child who has not attained the age of 16 years is guilty of a Class F felony if that person has knowledge that another person intends to have, is having or has had sexual intercourse or sexual contact with the child, is physically and emotionally capable of taking action which will prevent the intercourse <b>or</b> <b>contact</b> from taking place or being repeated, fails to take that action and the failure to act exposes the child to an unreasonable risk that intercourse <b>or</b> <b>contact</b> may occur between the child and the other person or facilitates the intercourse <b>or</b> <b>contact</b> that does occur between the child and the other person.|$|E
40|$|Various {{examples}} are provided for organic tunnel field effect transistors (OTFET), and methods thereof. In one example, an OTFET includes a first intrinsic layer (i-layer) of organic semiconductor material disposed over a gate insulating layer; source (<b>or</b> drain) <b>contact</b> stacks disposed on {{portions of the}} first i-layer; a second i-layer of organic semiconductor material disposed on the first i-layer surrounding the source (<b>or</b> drain) <b>contact</b> stacks; an n-doped organic semiconductor layer disposed on the second i-layer; and a drain (<b>or</b> source) <b>contact</b> layer disposed on the n-doped organic semiconductor layer. The source (<b>or</b> drain) <b>contact</b> stacks can include a p-doped injection layer, a source (<b>or</b> drain) <b>contact</b> layer, and a contact insulating layer. In another example, a method includes disposing a first i-layer over a gate insulating layer; forming source <b>or</b> drain <b>contact</b> stacks; and disposing a second i-layer, an n-doped organic semiconductor layer, and a drain <b>or</b> source <b>contact...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{wires that}} make up the {{thermocouple}} must be insulated from each other everywhere, except at the sensing junction. Any additional electrical contact between the wires, <b>or</b> <b>contact</b> of a wire to other conductive objects, can modify the voltage and give a false reading of temperature.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxyzine {{can also}} be used for the {{treatment}} of allergic conditions, such as chronic urticaria, atopic <b>or</b> <b>contact</b> dermatoses, and histamine-mediated pruritus. These have also been confirmed in both recent and past studies to have no adverse effects on the liver, blood, nervous system or urinary tract.|$|E
25|$|The {{ignition}} firing sequence {{begins with}} the points (<b>or</b> <b>contact</b> breaker) closed. A steady current flows from the battery, through the current-limiting resistor, through the primary coil, through the closed breaker points and finally back to the battery. This current produces a magnetic field within the coil's core. This magnetic field forms the energy reservoir {{that will be used}} to drive the ignition spark.|$|E

Rainbows and mirages are examples of optical phenomena. Optical communication provides the backbone for both the Internet and modern telephony.|$|E

Allegations against the hospital were directed at the examining nurse who allegedly fabricated statements concerning the initial medical examination, her supervisor (who adopted those statements even though they were contrary to the examination), and the failure of the Hospital to supervise these employees.|$|E
40|$|During {{early stages}} of odontogenesis, {{differentiating}} ameloblasts form cytoplasmic processes which penetrate deeply into developing uncalcified dentine. Some of these cytoplasmic protrusions form close approximations <b>or</b> <b>contacts</b> with odontoblast processes. The contacts are {{of a variety of}} morphological types, but their membranes never fuse or form any known type of cell junction. The present results, together with those derived from other studies, suggest that the approximations <b>or</b> <b>contacts</b> {{may play a role in}} inductive mechanisms of the cytodifferentiation of odontogenic cells...|$|R

25|$|Currently {{available}} scanners typically use {{charge-coupled device}} (CCD) <b>or</b> <b>contact</b> image sensor (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas older drum scanners use a photomultiplier tube as the image sensor. Early color film scanners used a halogen lamp and a three-color filter wheel, so three exposures {{were needed to}} scan a single color image. Due to heating problems, the worst of them being the potential destruction of the scanned film, this technology was later replaced by non-heating light sources such as color LEDs.|$|E
25|$|Patch {{testing is}} a method used to {{determine}} if a specific substance causes allergic inflammation of the skin. It tests for delayed reactions. It is used to help ascertain the cause of skin contact allergy, <b>or</b> <b>contact</b> dermatitis. Adhesive patches, usually treated with a number of common allergic chemicals or skin sensitizers, are applied to the back. The skin is then examined for possible local reactions at least twice, usually at 48 hours after application of the patch, and again two or three days later.|$|E
25|$|Motor car {{licences}} {{issued in}} the United Kingdom distinguish between automatic and manual transmission vehicles, {{depending on whether}} or not a driving test was passed in a vehicle with manual transmission (unless a vehicle test was taken in the UK before such distinction was made). While a manual transmission vehicle licence permits the holder to drive a vehicle of either kind, an automatic transmission vehicle licence is solely for vehicles with automatic transmission. The licence also shows whether a driver requires glasses <b>or</b> <b>contact</b> lenses to meet the legal driving requirements, if known.|$|E
