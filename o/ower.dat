5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea is the morel that is {{cultivated}} commercially per US patents 4594809 and 4757640. This {{process was}} developed in 1982 by Ronald <b>Ower</b> with {{what he thought was}} Morchella esculenta; M.rufobrunnea had not yet been described. The cultivation protocol consists of preparing a spawn culture that is mixed with nutrient-poor soil. This mixture is laid on nutrient-rich soil and kept sufficiently moist until fruiting. In the nutrient-poor substrate, the fungus forms sclerotia—hardened masses of mycelia that serve as food reserves. Under appropriate environmental conditions, these sclerotia grow into morels.|$|E

25|$|Captain Charles Fielding assumed {{command in}} June 1803. On 16 November 1803, Circe was sailing {{to return to}} her station on the {{blockade}} of France after gales had driven her into the North Sea. At 3pm she struck the Lemon and <b>Ower</b> sandbank. Although she was able to get over the bank, she lost her rudder and her hull started to let in water. By 2am on 17 November she was able to anchor and daylight revealed that she was off the coast of Norfolk. Several fishing vessels came out of Yarmouth to help. She took the captains of two of them on board as pilots, and towing their boats, sailed for the port. However, the weather had not improved and, despite her crew's efforts at the pumps, the water in her kept rising. Fielding decided to abandon ship and at 7pm her crew transferred to the fishing vessels. The subsequent court martial blamed inaccuracies in Circes navigation charts for her loss.|$|E

40|$|Premise of the study: Numerous {{long-term}} {{studies in}} seasonal habitats have tracked interannual variation in fi rst fl <b>owering</b> date (FFD) {{in relation to}} climate, documenting the effect of warming on the FFD of many species. Despite these efforts, long-term phenological observations are still lacking for many species. If we could forecast responses based on taxonomic affi nity, however, then we could leverage existing data to predict the climate-related phenological shifts of many taxa not yet studied; Methods: We examined phenological time series of 1226 species occurrences (1031 unique species in 119 families) across seven sites in North America and England to determine whether family membership (or family mean FFD) predicts the sensitivity of FFD to standardized interannual changes in temperature and precipitation during seasonal periods before fl <b>owering</b> and whether families differ signifi cantly {{in the direction of}} their phenological shifts; Key results: Patterns observed among species within and across sites are mirrored among family means across sites; earlyfl <b>owering</b> families advance their FFD in response to warming more than late-fl <b>owering</b> families. By contrast, we found no consistent relationships among taxa between mean FFD and sensitivity to precipitation as measured here; Conclusions: Family membership can be used to identify taxa of high and low sensitivity to temperature within the seasonal, temperate zone plant communities analyzed here. The high sensitivity of early-fl <b>owering</b> families (and the absence of earlyfl <b>owering</b> families not sensitive to temperature) may refl ect plasticity in fl <b>owering</b> time, which may be adaptive in environments where early-season conditions are highly variable among years...|$|R
