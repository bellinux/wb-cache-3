5|$|Christian Science {{is a set}} <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> and {{practices}} belonging to the metaphysical family of new religious movements. It was developed in 19th-century New England by Mary Baker Eddy, who argued in her book Science and Health (1875) that sickness is an illusion that can be corrected by prayer alone. The book became Christian Science's central text, along with the Bible, and by 2001 had sold over nine million copies.|$|E
5|$|Considering mental {{states as}} three-place {{relations}} in this way, representative realism {{makes it possible}} to hold together all of the elements necessary to the solution of this problem. Further, mental representations are not only the objects <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> and desires, but are also the domain over which mental processes operate. They can be considered the ideal link between the syntactic notion of mental content and the computational notion of functional architecture. These notions are, according to Fodor, our best explanation of mental processes.|$|E

5|$|Before {{contact with}} Christian missionaries during both the Dutch and Qing periods, Taiwanese aborigines held a variety <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> in spirits, gods, sacred symbols and myths that helped their {{societies}} find meaning and order. Although {{there is no}} evidence of a unified belief system shared among the various indigenous groups, there is evidence that several groups held supernatural beliefs in certain birds and bird behavior.

The Paiwan and other southern groups worship the Formosan hundred pacer snake and use the diamond patterns on its back in many designs. In many Plains Aborigines societies, the power to communicate with the supernatural world was exclusively held by women called Inibs. During the period of Dutch colonization, the Inibs were removed from the villages to eliminate their influence and pave the way for Dutch missionary work...|$|E

5|$|Christian {{feminism}} is {{a branch of}} feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity {{in light of the}} equality of women and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the ordination of women, male dominance and the balance of parenting in Christian marriage, claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church. The Christian Bible refers to women in positions of authority in Judges 4:4 and Kings 22:14.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the many}} ethnic sub-groups in Madagascar adhere to their own set <b>of</b> <b>beliefs,</b> {{practices}} and ways of life that have historically contributed to their unique identities. However, {{there are a number}} of core cultural features that are common throughout the island, creating a strongly unified Malagasy cultural identity. In addition to a common language and shared traditional religious beliefs around a creator god and veneration of the ancestors, the traditional Malagasy worldview is shaped by values that emphasize fihavanana (solidarity), vintana (destiny), tody (karma), and hasina, a sacred life force that traditional communities believe imbues and thereby legitimates authority figures within the community or family. Other cultural elements commonly found throughout the island include the practice of male circumcision; strong kinship ties; a widespread belief in the power of magic, diviners, astrology and witch doctors; and a traditional division of social classes into nobles, commoners, and slaves.|$|E
5|$|Fodor {{starts with}} some criticisms of {{so-called}} standard realism. This view is characterized, according to Fodor, by two distinct assertions. One of these regards the internal structure of mental states and asserts that such states are non-relational. The other concerns the semantic theory of mental content and asserts {{that there is}} an isomorphism between the causal roles of such contents and the inferential web <b>of</b> <b>beliefs.</b> Among modern philosophers of mind, the majority view seems to be that the first of these two assertions is false, but that the second is true. Fodor departs from this view in accepting the truth of the first thesis but rejecting strongly the truth of the second.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} probabilistic belief change, {{in particular}} the type of change occurring when information is added {{which is consistent with}} the old beliefs. In the AGM theory <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> revision this type <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> change is known as an expansion, and is usually considered to be easy compared to revision and contraction, the two other main types <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> changes the AGM theory distinguishes. If logical theories are used to represent the belief states, then an explicit definition of expansion can be given, and, at first sight, probabilistic conditioning seems a natural generalization of this notion in the context <b>of</b> probabilistic <b>belief</b> states. However, we argue that it may be more correct to view conditioning and expansion as two different kinds <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> change, and we discuss {{the differences between the two}} kinds in the context <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> states represented by partially determined probability functions. 1 Introduction The AGM theory <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> revision [7, 8] has become an importan [...] ...|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the view that}} science rests on foundational assumptions, coherentism asserts that statements are justified by being a part of a coherent system. Or, rather, individual statements cannot be validated on their own: only coherent systems can be justified. A prediction of a transit of Venus is justified by its being coherent with broader beliefs about celestial mechanics and earlier observations. As explained above, observation is a cognitive act. That is, it relies on a pre-existing understanding, a systematic set <b>of</b> <b>beliefs.</b> An observation of a transit of Venus requires a huge range of auxiliary beliefs, such as those that describe the optics of telescopes, the mechanics of the telescope mount, and an understanding of celestial mechanics. If the prediction fails and a transit is not observed, that is likely to occasion an adjustment in the system, a change in some auxiliary assumption, rather than a rejection of the theoretical system.|$|E
5|$|Canada is religiously diverse, {{encompassing}} a {{wide range}} <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> and customs. Canada has no official church, {{and the government is}} officially committed to religious pluralism. Freedom of religion in Canada is a constitutionally protected right, allowing individuals to assemble and worship without limitation or interference. The practice of religion is now generally considered a private matter throughout society and the state. With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life, Canada has become a post-Christian, secular state. The majority of Canadians consider religion to be unimportant in their daily lives, but still believe in God. According to the 2011 census, 67.3% of Canadians identify as Christian; of these, Roman Catholics make up the largest group, accounting for 38.7% of the population. Much of the remainder is made up of Protestants, who accounted for approximately 27% in a 2011 survey. The largest Protestant denomination is the United Church of Canada (accounting for 6.1% of Canadians), followed by Anglicans (5.0%), and Baptists (1.9%). Secularization has been growing since the 1960s. In 2011, 23.9% declared no religious affiliation, compared to 16.5% in 2001. The remaining 8.8% are affiliated with non-Christian religions, the largest of which are Islam (3.2%) and Hinduism (1.5%).|$|E
5|$|Vermigli's Eucharistic {{views were}} {{accepted}} in Zürich, but {{he ran into}} controversy over his doctrine of double predestination. Similarly to John Calvin, Vermigli believed {{that in some way}} God wills the damnation of those not chosen for salvation. Vermigli attempted to avoid confrontation over the issue, but Bibliander began to openly attack him in 1557, at one point allegedly challenging him to a duel with a double-edged axe. Bibliander held the Erasmian view that God only predestines that those who believe in him will be saved, not the salvation of any individual. Reformed theologians during this time held a variety <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> about predestination, and Bullinger's position is ambiguous, but they agreed that God sovereignly and unconditionally chooses whom to save. They believed salvation is not based on any characteristic of a person, including their faith. Bullinger and the Zürich church did not necessarily agree with Vermigli's double predestinarian view, but Bibliander's view was deemed unallowable. He was dismissed in 1560, in part to assure other Reformed churches of the Zürich church's orthodoxy. Vermigli was involved in predestinarian controversy again when Zanchi, who had remained in Strasbourg when Vermigli left for Zürich, was accused of heretical teachings on the Eucharist and predestination by the Lutheran Johann Marbach. Vermigli was selected to write the official judgement of the Zürich church on the matter in a statement signed by Bullinger and other leaders December1561. His affirmation of a strong doctrine of predestination represented the opinion of the Zürich church as a whole.|$|E

I am interested in finding out how the cycle <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> is revealed and what effects of the cycle <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> toward the speaker are. In my thesis, I use literary approach. Furthermore, I use the elements of poetry as the tools to reveal the cycle <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> and its effects to the speaker. I also use the mythological background as the supporting concept. Through the analysis, I {{found out that the}} cycle <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> is revealed through Proserpine?s figure and through the elements of poetry. I found out that Proserpine is mentioned through paradoxes and symbols in the beginning, {{and the end of the}} poem to reveal the paradoxical role of Proserpine. The speaker uses Proserpine to represent the cycle <b>of</b> <b>belief.</b> The cycle <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> is also revealed through the elements of poetry. The use of metaphor of the sea describes the cycle <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> and in this sea paganism and Christianity rise and sink by turns.

I found that the transition from ancient Rome to Christianity has brought some effects to the speaker. He experiences loss and sadness. In his pain, he reproaches Christ and Mary and shows his refusal toward Christ. Through this analysis, I learn that a change is not always an improvement to all people in society...|$|R

40|$|A {{principal}} assumption in the epistemology {{of disagreement}} is that we, as rational subjects, assess evidence neutrally {{in order to}} justify our beliefs.

40|$|The study <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> {{change has}} been an active area in {{philosophy}} and AI. In recent years two special cases <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> change, belief revision and belief update, have been studied in detail. Belief revision and update are clearly not the only possible notions <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> change. In this paper we investigate properties of a range <b>of</b> possible <b>belief</b> change operations. We start with an abstract notion <b>of</b> a <b>belief</b> change system and provide a logical language that describes belief change in such systems. We then consider several reasonable properties one can impose on such systems and characterize them axiomatically. We show that both belief revision and update fit into our classification. As a consequence, we get both a semantic and an axiomatic (proof-theoretic) characterization <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> revision and update (as well as some belief change operations that generalize them), in one natural framework. 1 Introduction The study <b>of</b> <b>belief</b> {{change has been}} an active area in philosophy and in artifici [...] ...|$|R
