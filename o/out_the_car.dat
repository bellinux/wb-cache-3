The boy sets off to the railroad construction area, passing the dangerous terrain without incident. The father, Tony Prolo (Senior), greets his young son and happily takes his lunch. His young son begins tossing rocks {{across the street and}} runs out into the road and is knocked down by a passing vehicle. Tony rushes to his son's aid and the rich man, Mr. Sears gets <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> and attempts to comfort the father. The father rejects him and rushes home, carrying his son in his arms. At home, Tony Prolo and his wife attend to their son and pray for his health.|$|E

In a bid {{to protect him from}} himself, Gail and Nick lock him in the cellar of the Bistro. However he fakes his own death and manages to escape his makeshift prison cell. He runs to the garage, (where his car is being repaired) and drives off in it much to his family's horror. However, while driving the car, he sees his daughter Lily in the road and swerves the car and flips over in it. Gary Windass {{attempted to}} save Lily but they both ended up trapped under it. When the two are pulled <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> suddenly catches fire and left Anna Windass with severely injured legs after catching fire due to it spreading.|$|E
25|$|AC Cars also {{produced}} a Le Mans coupé. The {{car was a}} one-off and was nearly destroyed after a high-speed tire blow-out at the 1964 Le Mans race. The car was qualified conservatively second in GT. The race started well with the AC, chassis number A98, maintaining {{its position in the}} top two in GT and even leading the class for a time. This was not to last as an act of sabotage (newspaper in the fuel tank) began to block the fuel filter. The car lost time until this was diagnosed and cleaned <b>out.</b> <b>The</b> <b>car</b> proceeded on at the predetermined conservative lap time and for the next stint remained trouble free. The car was able to match the Shelby Daytona's speed despite running a higher differential ratio (2.88 instead of 3.07) and a lower state of engine tune for reliability (355hp instead of the Daytona's 385hp).|$|E

500|$|Sam is a laid-back but enthusiastic, brown-coated {{anthropomorphic}} [...] "canine shamus". He wears {{either a}} gray or blue {{suit with a}} matching fedora, to make people more cooperative when conversing with a six-foot talking dog. A warped sense of justice makes Sam the more passionate of the pair for their police work, only held back from taking his job seriously by Max. Nevertheless, he enjoys the mannerisms and dress that come with their line of work. Sam possesses near encyclopedic amounts of knowledge, particularly on obscure topics, and is prone to long-winded sentences filled with elaborate terminology. Although he is always keen to display this information—regardless of its accuracy—Sam can be capable of total ignorance towards more practical matters; for instance, despite his regard for his DeSoto Adventurer, he is severely negligent with the car's maintenance. Sam still retains various doglike qualities: he is excitable, enthusiastic but also susceptible to emotions of embarrassment and guilt. Nevertheless, Sam is [...] "not above sticking his head <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> window and letting his tongue flap in the breeze". Sam rarely loses his temper, {{and is able to}} react to panic-inducing situations with extreme calm. When he does get angry, Sam tends to react in a violent, uncharacteristically savage manner, in which case it is usually Max that calms him down and prevents him from acting upon his anger. Sam usually is armed with an oversized [...]44 revolver.|$|E

The angry Godzilla is calmed by eating a Snickers bar. Godzilla is portrayed as both human-sized and much larger. Another cross-promotion commercial was made, featuring Godzilla in a Fiat 500L car commercial. In it, Godzilla is rampaging through a city, devouring Fiat cars as he goes, with a soldier claiming that he was [...] "craving Italian." [...] He then approaches to devour a Fiat 500L, {{but because of the}} car's size being larger than a 500 model, Godzilla cannot swallow it. Nearly choking on it, he spits <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> as it drives away.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1912, NYPD detective Lieutenant Charles Becker and the [...] "Gambling Squad" [...] raided The Rosebud. In {{exchange}} for not closing down the resort, Rose agreed to pay Becker 25% of his weekly income, which ran as high as $10,000 a month. Rose would also become Becker's official collector {{for the rest of}} the gambling establishments from which Becker would extort money. His role in Becker's organization was outlined in an affidavit by Herman Rosenthal, a gambler who had fallen out with Becker, and published in the New York World. On July 16, 1912, after meeting with District Attorney Charles S. Whitman, the four members of the Lenox Avenue Gang gunned down Rosenthal in the doorway of the Hotel Metropole. The murder car was traced by police to a Lower East Side automobile rental service, where one of the owners identified Rose as having rented <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> on the night of the murder. With this information, a number of gamblers and underworld figures including Bridgie Webber, Harry Vallon, Sam Schepps, and Jack Sullivan were rounded up as suspects.|$|E
2500|$|Max Tackett, a 33-year-old Arkansas State Police officer rookie at the time, {{realized}} that a car had been stolen on the nights of the murders, and a previously stolen car was found abandoned. On Friday, June 28, 1946, Tackett found a car that had been reported stolen in a parking lot. He staked <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>car</b> until someone came back to it. He arrested a 21-year-old woman. She said she had just married her husband in Shreveport, but he was currently in Atlanta, Texas trying to sell another stolen car. Homer Carter, chief of police in Atlanta, told Tackett that a man had tried selling a stolen car {{to one of his}} citizens. Tackett asked the citizen if he would recognize the suspect, but the man said that he would not. Tackett noticed that the citizen had a distinct look, which included a cowboy hat and boots. Tackett told the citizen, [...] "You wouldn't recognize him, but he would recognize you." [...] Max then asked the citizen if {{he would be willing to}} walk with him into several public places. Tackett had the idea that the suspect would not want to see the citizen and would try to avoid him. On a Saturday in July, Tackett walked into the Arkansas Motor Coach bus station on Front Street, near Union Station, with the citizen. Tackett saw a man run out the back of the building. He chased after him and caught him on the fire escape. The man, Youell Swinney, would not talk, but his wife Peggy confessed in great detail that he was the Phantom Killer and that he killed Betty Jo Booker and Paul Martin.|$|E
