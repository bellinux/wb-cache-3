40|$|Two {{theories}} {{emerged as}} the cause of undesired oscillations at frequencies between 40 and 60 Hz in the Orbiter Vehicle inboard and <b>outboard</b> <b>elevon</b> actuation subsystems during hardware testing. Both the "hardover feedback" and "deadspace" theories were examined using continuous system modeling program simulation. Results did not support the "hardover feedback" theory but showed that deadspace in the torque feedback spring connections to the servospools must be considered to be a possible cause of the oscillations. Further investigation is recommended...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a wind tunnel test to {{determine}} the force, moment, and hinge-moment characteristics of the Configuration 2 A Space Shuttle Vehicle Orbiter at Mach numbers 5, 7 and 10 are presented. The model was an 0. 015 -scale representation of the Orbiter Configuration 2 A used in test 0 A 11 A and later tests. Six-component aerodynamic force and moment data were recorded from a 1. 50 -inch internal strain-gage balance, and base pressures were taken for axial and drag force corrections. Hinge-moment data were obtained for the rudder and the inboard and <b>outboard</b> <b>elevon</b> panels of the starboard wing...|$|E
40|$|In {{the event}} of a control surface failure, the purpose of a {{reconfigurable}} control system is to redistribute the control effort among the remaining working surfaces such that satisfactory stability and performance are retained. Four reconfigurable control design methods were investigated for the X- 33 vehicle: Redistributed Pseudo-Inverse, General Constrained Optimization, Automated Failure Dependent Gain Schedule, and an Off-line Nonlinear General Constrained Optimization. The Off-line Nonlinear General Constrained Optimization approach was chosen for implementation on the X- 33. Two example failures are shown, a right <b>outboard</b> <b>elevon</b> jam at 25 deg. at a Mach 3 entry condition, and a left rudder jam at 30 degrees. Note however, that reconfigurable control laws have been designed for the entire flight envelope. Comparisons between responses with the nominal controller and reconfigurable controllers show the benefits of reconfiguration. Single jam aerosurface failures were considered, and failure detection and identification is considered accomplished in the actuator controller. The X- 33 flight control system will incorporate reconfigurable flight control in the baseline system...|$|E
40|$|The {{potentials}} and {{capability for}} implementing a LAMS (load alleviation and mode suppression) {{system on the}} YF- 12 A {{for the purpose of}} flight research were evaluated. The nature of the research is to minimize the design risk in application of LAMS to future aircraft. The results of the study show that the YF- 12 A would be a suitable test bed for continuing development of LAMS technology. This was demonstrated by defining five candidate LAMS systems and analytically evaluating them with regard to performance and mechanization. Each of the five systems used a different combination of force producers. A small canard vane or a mass-reaction device mounted near the cockpit was considered as a possible LAMS force producer, together with the existing inboard and <b>outboard</b> <b>elevons.</b> It was concluded that a combination of canard vane and <b>outboard</b> <b>elevons</b> would provide the most effective system for the YF- 12 A...|$|R
50|$|In {{the initial}} design, elevon (combined {{elevator}} and aileron) control surfaces were {{set into the}} trailing edge of the aft wing section, on either side of a vertical rudder. On the second machine the elevons were moved outwards and additional elevons placed above them, with various arrangements being tried. The third machine retained the <b>outboard</b> <b>elevons</b> behind a modified wing and discarded the upper surfaces.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the inboard and <b>outboard</b> <b>elevons,</b> varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{documented}} of an analysis {{conducted to determine}} space shuttle vehicle (SSV) subsystem margins for the reference flight profile for the first orbital flight test (OFT- 1). In general, the results show increased margins for the OFT- 1 indicators when compared to Mission 3 A resutls. The inclusion of element and wing aerodynamic variations on OFT- 1, in combination with winds and systems dispersions, resulted in the forward Z (FTO 1) attach load indicator exceeding specified limits. The inboard and <b>outboard</b> <b>elevon</b> hinge moment margins (9 percent and 3 percent, respectively) on OFT- 1 reflect values consistent with the load relief requirements dictated by elevon hinge moment variations. All other structural load indicators for OFT- 1 had margins in excess of 10 percent. The SSV first stage stagnation heating indicators for OFT- 1 were about 45 percent less than for Mission 3 A. The hydraulic systems demands for both missions were essentially the same. The results also show OFT- 1 performance requirements from the consideration of winds and dispersions to be approximately 3, 300 lbs greater than Mission 3 A...|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnel {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} on an 0. 010 -scale representation of the VL 70 - 000140 C Integrated Space Shuttle Launch Vehicle. The primary test objective was to obtain Reynolds number effects on orbiter elevon hinge moments and wing bending/torsional moments. Launch vehicle aerodynamic force data were also recorded. The elevon hinge moments, wing bending/torsional moments, and vehicle force data were recorded over an angle of attack range of - 6 deg to + 6 deg, an angle of sideslip range of - 6 deg to + 6 deg, at Mach numbers of 0. 6, 0. 975, 1. 05 and 1. 25. The Reynolds number was varied from a minimum of 4. 5 million/foot {{to a maximum of}} 11. 5 million/foot. The complete integrated configuration was tested with the orbiter elevons set at 0 deg and deflected to 9 deg on the <b>outboard</b> <b>elevon</b> and 10 deg on the inboard elevon. Testing was conducted in the TWT 19. 7 % porous transonic test section with the model sting mounted through the orbiter base. All aerodynamic force data were obtained from internal strain gage balance located in the orbiter...|$|E
40|$|Wind tunnel {{tests were}} {{conducted}} to: (1) determine the static stability characteristics of the Shuttle Vehicle 5 configuration; (2) determine {{the effect on the}} Vehicle 5 aerodynamic characteristics of External Tank (ET) and Solid Rocket Booster (SRB) nose shape, SRB nozzle shroud flare angle, orbiter to tank fairing, and sting location; (3) provide flow visualization using thin film oil paint; and (4) determine rudder, body flap, and inboard and <b>outboard</b> <b>elevon</b> hinge moments. The mated vehicle model was mounted in three different ways: (1) the orbiter mounted on the balance with the SRB's attached to the tank and the tank in turn attached to the orbiter; (2) the tank mounted on the balance (with the sting protruding through the tank base) with the SRB's and orbiter attached to the tank, and (3) with the tank mounted on the balance and the balance in turn supported by a forked sting entering the nozzle of each SRB, extending forward into the SRB's then crossing over to the tank to provide a balance socket. Data were obtained for Mach numbers from 0. 6 through 4. 96 at angles-of-attack and -sideslip from - 10 to 10 degrees...|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Draken {{consisted of}} two sections, front and rear, joined by bolts. The forward section, which was integral with the intake ducts and neighbouring wing structure, accommodates the fire-control radar, cockpit, nose undercarriage, integral fuel tanks and various systems. The rear portion, which was manufactured as a single piece alongside {{the rest of the}} inner wing, contained the engine and afterburner, bag-type fuel tanks, armament, main landing gear, and other systems. The flight control surfaces consisted of a rudder, along with inboard and <b>outboard</b> <b>elevons,</b> the outer sections being fitted with mass-balance weights. Each surface was operated by a tandem hydraulic jack, which was connected to separate circuits. As a weight-saving measure, the hydraulic systems would operate at a line pressure of 2,9871b/sq, which would be greater than double the pressure used in the earlier Saab 29 Tunnan.|$|R
40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the results of}} a computational study done to compute the inviscid longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics of the Space Shuttle Orbiter for Mach numbers 10 and 15 at angles of attack of 40, 50, 55, and 60 degrees. These computations were done to provide limited aerodynamic data in support of the Orbiter contingency abort task. The Orbiter had all the control surfaces in the undeflected position. The unstructured grid software FELISA was used for these computations with the equilibrium air option. Normal and axial force coefficients and pitching moment coefficients were computed. The hinge moment coefficients of the body flap and the inboard and <b>outboard</b> <b>elevons</b> were also computed. These results were compared with Orbiter Air Data Book (OADB) data and those computed using GASP. The comparison with the GASP results showed very good agreement in Cm and Ca at all the points. The computed axial force coefficients were smaller than those computed by GASP. There were noticeable differences between the present results and those in the OADB at angles of attack greater than 50 degrees...|$|R
40|$|The phase-change paint {{technique}} {{was used to}} make heat-transfer measurements on five Space Shuttle Orbiter models with differentially-deflected <b>elevons.</b> The <b>outboard</b> <b>elevons</b> were deflected windward through an angle delta when the inboard elevons were deflected through an angle - 2 delta, where delta = 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 deg. The models were tested in air at Mach 6 and Mach 10 with two different flow conditions at each Mach number. Each test was run at three angles of attack; 20, 28, and 35 deg. This study was restricted to the windward side of the wing/elevons area. Multiple chord-wise streaks of high heating often occurred on the wings and sometimes extended to localized spots of high heating on the windward-deflected elevons. The extent of heating was a function of angle of attack and test conditions, but in general differential deflection of the elevons affected the wing heat-transfer coefficient {{on the order of}} 40 percent or less whereas the windward elevon heat-transfer coefficient was a function of the deflection angle and could be many times the value determined for the undeflected elevon...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the absence}} of a {{conventional}} rudder the Habicht had drag rudders. [...] These were leading edge flaps placed near the tips and formed by mounting the leading edge surfaces on a hinge so they could open upwards and downwards (those of the Horten H.I had extended downwards only). [...] Their differential operational controlled yaw and they served as conventional airbrakes when opened together. The whole trailing edge was occupied by control surfaces; the outer panels had <b>elevons</b> <b>outboard</b> and landing flaps inboard and there were further landing flaps on the centre section. Rear control surfaces were assisted by Flettner servo tabs and were ply covered.|$|R
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} analysis {{which includes the}} effect of mismatch and filler bar was developed to predict the strain isolator pad reuseable surface insulation through-the-thickness interface stresses. Parametric studies were conducted for simulated shock loading on square tiles. Expected loads on an actual tile were also studied. The results indicate that when no mismatch is present, linear solutions tend to give nonconservative maximum stresses relative to the nonlinear solutions. When mismatch is present, the linear maximum stresses are only conservative at low load levels and highly nonconservative at high load levels. Although the presence of filler bar reduces maximum tensile stresses in some cases, {{it does not appear}} that the nominal dimension filler bar can reduce the nonlinear stress to a level at which the linear solution becomes conservative relative to the nonlinear solution. Moreover, on an <b>outboard</b> trailing edge <b>elevon</b> tile at descent with + 20 deg flap, the linear analysis is 49 % nonconservative relative to the {{nonlinear analysis}} with filler bar...|$|R
40|$|Brian, Chris, Danny, Parul and Raghu {{arrived at}} the UMore Park Airfield around 9 : 00 am on Friday Jan 30 th, 2015 for the sixteenth flight of Fenrir. Fenrir flight 16 was to test a new flight control law with just the pitch-damper (pitch_gain = - 0. 2). The purpose of Fenerir flight 16 was to put {{excitations}} on elevator and aileron to gather response data in order to perform system identification and parameter estimation to support the Performance Adaptive Aeroelastic Wing (PAAW, www. paaw. net) program in designing and flight testing the mAEWing 1 vehicle. The control surfaces for this flight were also allocated differently from previous flights by allocating <b>outboard</b> surfaces as <b>elevons.</b> The flight plan was for the pilot to fly the aircraft straight and level (with the pitch-damper running), {{and to see the}} aircraft response for 3 - 2 - 1 - 1 excitations of increasing frequencies on the elevator and aileron. Takeoff was followed by a straight line run down a short section of our runway. Unfortunately, the aircraft's battery failed so the flight was cut short. Future flights will include a runup to full throttle to test the batteries...|$|R
