60|$|Apparently {{rendered}} savage by this event, the Russians let fly a volley {{from their}} four great-guns, but without serious result. They had been admirably pointed, however, {{for the two}} <b>outer</b> <b>shots</b> hit our turrets, deeply indented them, and glanced off, while the inner shots went slap through the flying structure {{as if it had}} been made of pasteboard, leaving clean-cut holes, which, of course, only made the place more airy.|$|E
50|$|Filming {{began in}} February 2005. The main filming {{location}} {{was in the}} village of St Michael Penkevil in Cornwall. Locations on the Isle of Man were used for all filming outside the village. The <b>outer</b> <b>shots</b> of the train is on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, the scene with the car going over a small bridge with the train going over another is just outside Goathland (Aidensfield in Heartbeat).|$|E
40|$|Stimulated Raman {{backscatter}} (SRS) {{is used as}} {{a remote}} sensor to quantify the instantaneous laser power after transfer from outer to inner cones that cross in a National Ignition Facility (NIF) gas-filled hohlraum plasma. By matching SRS between a <b>shot</b> reducing <b>outer</b> vs a <b>shot</b> reducing inner power we infer that ~half of the incident outer-cone power is transferred to inner cones, for the specific time and wavelength configuration studied. This is the first instantaneous non-disruptive measure of power transfer in an indirect drive NIF experiment using optical measurements. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
5000|$|The 759 CE text Tai bai yin jing (太白陰經) by Tang {{military}} official Li Quan (李筌) contains the oldest known extant depiction and {{description of the}} volley fire technique. The Tang crossbow volley fire formation was rectangular and the illustration shows each circle as one soldier. In the front is a line labeled [...] "shooting crossbows" [...] (發弩) and behind that line are shorter rows of crossbowmen, two facing right and two facing left, and they are labeled [...] "loading crossbows" [...] (張弩). The commander (大將軍) is situated {{in the middle of}} the formation and to his right and left are vertical rows of drummers (鼓) who coordinate the firing and reloading procedure in procession: who loaded their weapons, stepped forward to the <b>outer</b> ranks, <b>shot,</b> and then retired to reload. According to Li Quan, [...] "the classics say that the crossbow is fury. It is said that its noise is so powerful that it sounds like fury, and that's why they named it this way," [...] and by using the volley fire method there is no end to the sound and fury, and the enemy is unable to approach. Here he is referring to the word for [...] "crossbow" [...] nu which is also a homophone for the word for fury nu.|$|R
40|$|In medico-legal literature, only a {{small number}} of {{publications}} deal with lethal injuries caused by shots with modified guns. This might lead to the conclusion that such cases are extremely rare. However, there are cases again and yet again. During the investigation process, the modified gun is of particular importance since it can show an unusual ballistic behaviour. The present paper reports on a suicide of a 60 -year-old man, committed with a modified revolver and a lead bullet. The man had a single gunshot wound with entrance at the right temporal bone. Autopsy revealed that the bullet had fragmented into two major parts. The smaller one stood outside the cranial cavity and pushed its way alongside between the cranial bone and scalp to its end position in the left temporal area. The bigger part entered the cranial cavity and ended in the left parietal lobe. In shots on ballistic soap and on a head-model, the ballistics of the weapon and lead bullet were characterized. The angle necessary for bullet fragmentation was determined by shots on ballistic soap and turned out to be 55 °- 60 ° at a velocity of around 200  m/s. This knowledge was transferred to contact shots on a head-model consisting of a layered polyurethane sphere filled with 10  % ballistic gelatine and covered with a skin-like cap almost all around. The resulting injury pattern corresponded to the one of the suicide person. The bigger bullet part entered the skull while the smaller part pushed its way alongside between skin and skull causing an <b>outer</b> contour <b>shot.</b> Furthermore, the revolver was documented firing off two bullets by one trigger pull-a phenomenon of importance for forensic casework the authors have not found reported in forensic literature...|$|R
40|$|Fossil {{power plant}} {{efficiency}} is improved by increasing steam temperature and pressure. Current martensitic and ferritic steels {{do not have}} the required oxidation and spallation properties for boiler tube applications as service conditions increase. Spallation inside the tube can lead to blockage, overheating, creep rupture and turbine erosion. The current steels are limited to 620 oC, therefore austenitic stainless steels are proposed for boiler tube applications to enable higher operating conditions. This investigation compared the oxidation and spallation behaviour of the current martensitic steels (T 91, T 92) with the proposed austenitic stainless steels (super 304 H, shot peened super 304 H, 347 HFG), in air at 600 - 700 oC. Oxide morphology was characterised using SEM and EDX analysis and oxidation kinetics were recorded using specific mass gain and oxide thickness measurements over time. The martensitic steels formed non-protective Fe-rich oxides, which consistently spalled on cooling. The austenitic stainless steels showed little spallation and less mass gain compared to the T 92 steel. Double-layered oxides formed on the super 304 H and 347 H FG steels consisting of an inner protective Cr-rich spinel oxide and an <b>outer</b> Fe-rich oxide. <b>Shot</b> peening increased the oxidation resistance of the super 304 H steel forming significantly thinner, single-layer Cr-rich oxides with less mass gain...|$|R
2500|$|Grave Robbers from <b>Outer</b> Space was <b>shot</b> in November 1956, and had {{a private}} preview {{screening}} on March 15, 1957 at the Carlton Theatre in Los Angeles (the onscreen title at this time was Grave Robbers from Outer Space). Another year elapsed before Distributors Corporation of America (DCA) {{picked it up and}} copyrighted it, intending to distribute it during the spring of 1958, but the company folded and the film was not released until July 22, 1959 through Valiant Pictures, the receiver of DCA. By then the film had been re-titled Plan 9 from Outer Space. The original title gives the film the feel of a story from a pulp magazine. One story concerning the renaming is that the film's financiers, two local Baptist ministers, objected to the [...] "Grave Robbers" [...] part of the title. They reportedly considered the direct reference to grave robbery to be sacrilegious in nature, so Wood changed the title to [...] "Plan 9". The original title is mentioned at the end of Criswell's opening narration when he asks the audience, [...] "Can your heart stand the shocking facts about grave robbers from outer space?" [...] It is also possible Wood didn't want to notify his backers that the film was finally being distributed, since by 1959, the backers may have completely given up on their hopes of getting a return on their investment. The new title is less indicative of the content and might have itself contributed to distribution problems for the film. Like many independent films of the period, Plan 9 was distributed under a states' rights basis.|$|R
