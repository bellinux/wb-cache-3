50|$|Soil {{salination}} is {{the accumulation}} of free salts {{to such an extent}} that it leads to degradation of the agricultural value of soils and vegetation. Consequences include corrosion damage, reduced plant growth, erosion due to loss of plant cover and soil structure, and water quality problems due to sedimentation. Salination occurs due to a combination of natural and human-caused processes. Arid conditions favour salt accumulation. This is especially apparent when soil parent material is saline. Irrigation of arid lands is especially problematic. All irrigation water has some level of salinity. Irrigation, especially when it involves leakage from canals and <b>overirrigation</b> in the field, often raises the underlying water table. Rapid salination occurs when the land surface is within the capillary fringe of saline groundwater. Soil salinity control involves watertable control and flushing with higher levels of applied water in combination with tile drainage or another form of subsurface drainage.|$|E
40|$|In this study, seven citrus {{gardens in}} {{different}} parts of Darab were chosen to evaluate the drip irrigation systems. The evaluation process was based on the Merriam and Keller’s model (1978). Besides the evaluation of drip irrigation systems, the water requirement of citrus was estimated using four models including Blany-Criddle modified by FAO, Hargrive-Samani, Pan Evaporation and Solomon-Kodama model. On the basis of the results obtained by Hargrive-Samani with 1296 mm annual water requirements, a comparison was made between irrigation with existing systems and irrigation under favorable and desired conditions. The results from field measurements indicate a considerable reduction in the emitter discharges. The low pressure and emitter clogging could be two major reasons for the problem. Low pressure at head control, topography, head losses and also using no filter(s) or unefficient filters are the main reasons for the reduction. In some gardens, <b>overirrigation</b> even up to 2. 5 times of water requirement was practiced by using extra emitters and increased irrigation times. <b>Overirrigation</b> causes considerable water losses through deep percolation and in reased overwetting area. Field measurements indicated a good emission uniformity (EU) for the fields with <b>overirrigation.</b> EU in chosen fields varied from 40 to 91 %, AELQ varied from 31 to 82 % (poor to good) and PELQ varied from 36 to 82 %. This study showed that most farmers are not familiar with plant water requirements. The fields with efficient filtration due to using extra emitters per plant are mainly overirrigated. But fields without any filter of unefficient filters are not irrigated sufficiently. The very high manufacturing variation coefficient of IEM emitters (Cv= 0. 22), which are widely used in Darab, causes a design emission uniformity of 55 %...|$|E
40|$|The crop water {{production}} function (WPF), representing {{the relationship between}} crop yield and seasonal irrigation water, is {{a useful tool for}} irrigation planning purposes. The objective of the paper is to propose a methodology to evaluate the optimal seasonal irrigation depth based on the crop {{production function}}, the field distribution uniformity, and economic considerations. An extended unpublished database experimentally obtained on the onion crop on the island of Kula, Hawaii, was initially used to assess the crop WPF. The combination between the crop WPF and the model representing the field distribution uniformity allowed determining the area subjected to underirrigation and <b>overirrigation,</b> as well as the corresponding yield, that were finally averaged across the field. An economic comparison was also carried out in order to evaluate the optimal seasonal water depth aimed at maximizing the farmer's gross margin under different irrigation system distribution uniformities and water prices. According to the experimental data, it was observed that the onion crop is more sensitive to deficit than <b>overirrigation,</b> as well as that a quadratic model, valid for the entire range of the seasonal applied irrigation depths fitted better than a two-slope linear model, representing separately the conditions of deficit and over-irrigation. Moreover, the maximum yield, as well as maximum gross margin, can be obtained by applying average irrigation depths lower than those which correspond to the maximum yield, with percentages that declined at decreasing of water distribution coefficient and at increasing of water price. The proposed methodology can be applied even for other crops once the corresponding WPFs aree known, thus providing interesting evaluations that are useful for irrigation planning...|$|E

40|$|Background Freshwater {{comprises}} about a mere 2. 5 % {{of total}} global water, of which approximately two-thirds is locked into glaciers at the polar ice caps and on mountains. In conjunction with this, {{in many instances}} irrigation with freshwater causes an increase in soil salinity due to <b>overirrigation</b> of agricultural land, inefficient water use and poor drainage of unsuitable soils. The problem of salinity was recognized {{a long time ago}} and, due to the importance of irrigated agriculture, numerous efforts have been devoted towards improving crop species for better utilization of saline soils and water. Irrigating plants with saline water is a challenge for practitioners and researchers throughout the world. †Scope Recruiting wild halophytes with economic potential was suggested several decades ago as a way to reduce the damage caused by salinization of soil and water. A range of cultivation systems for the utilization of halophytes have been developed, for the production of biofuel, purification of saline effluent in constructed wetlands, landscap-ing, cultivation of gourmet vegetables, and more. This review critically analyses past and present halophyte-based production systems in the context of genetics, physiology, agrotechnical issues and product value. There are still dif-ficulties that need to be overcome, such as direct germination in saline conditions or genotype selection. However, more and more research is being directed not only towards determining salt tolerance of halophytes, but also t...|$|E
40|$|In this work, remote sensing-based {{assessments}} of actual evapotranspiration using METRIC integrated with a water balance model provided accurate estimates of irrigation performance. This new methodology was applied and {{tested in the}} Genil-Cabra Irrigation Scheme located in southern Spain during the 2004 - 2005 irrigation season. The performance indicators used, the annual relative irrigation supply (ARIS) and the irrigation water productivity (IWP), required ET input data which were calculated using either METRIC or standard FAO methodology. The new procedure that used METRIC detected <b>overirrigation</b> (ARIS of 1. 27) in situations where the ARIS calculated with the standard FAO methodology indicated near-optimal irrigation (ARIS of 0. 98). Additionally, the proposed methodology allows the estimation {{of the volume of}} applied water at the field scale. Comparisons between the ARIS and IWP values obtained from actual applied water records against those calculated with the new methodology resulted in good agreement. It is concluded that the integration of the METRIC method to calculate actual ET with a water balance model allowed the determination of performance indicators in an irrigation scheme in a reliable and accurate fashion, requiring only very limited information at the field level. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

40|$|In {{a number}} of {{deciduous}} tree crops a reliable pressure chamber measurement of water stress (midday stem water potential or SWP) has been recently developed and found to be closely related to both irrigation regime and tree physiological responses to stress. A standard pressure chamber {{is used for the}} measurement of SWP, but prior to sampling, the leaf is enclosed in a reflective plastic bag and allowed to equilibrate with the water potential in the stem at the point of leaf attachment. In this study, measurements were made on valley oak trees under a variety of landscape conditions in Napa and Sonoma Counties, CA. Measurements on leaves that were only allowed to equilibrate for relatively short times (10 to 15 minutes) were compared to the SWP as measured by adjacent leaves that were allowed to equilibrate for over 1 h. As found in other tree species, a 10 - to 15 -minute covering period appears sufficient in valley oaks for interior canopy shaded leaves to equilibrate with SWP. Using SWP in valley oaks that were nearby construction sites or agricultural land preparation, we confirmed that water stress was associated with root damage caused by these activities. SWP was also sensitive enough to follow the development of and the recovery from water stress over {{a number of}} irrigation cycles in an individual tree. We believe that SWP will be a valuable tool to determine the water needs of landscape valley oaks, particularly those with damaged root systems, while avoiding the potential for root disease development due to <b>overirrigation...</b>|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. Seepage may be {{prevented}} {{to some extent}} by employing proper methods of irrigation. <b>Overirrigation</b> may {{have a tendency to}} water-log the soil. A small head of water, properly used, will irrigate more land and do better work than a large head gone over the land hurriedly. The distance of irrigation ditches should be such that the water may travel between the ditches in about two hours. If land can be irrigated in the fall with the same care that crops are irrigated in the summer, there is an advantage to fall irrigation. If water cannot be properly cared for and this irrigation is uneven, it is a detriment rather than a benefit to the land. It is a disadvantage to ditch the potatoes as deep on the lighter soils as on the heavier soils. With the exception of the first crop it is best to irrigate alfalfa after the hay is cut. Irrigation of the stubble is more easily and more evenly done than the standing crop. The hay will cure more quickly on the dry soil than on previously irrigated soil. There is no material difference in the yields in sugar beets where the soil is plowed from 4 to 20 inches deep. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the soil is of a sandier nature. The plowing under of a second and third crop of alfalfa has not produced as large tonnage of sugar beets as the second and third crops that were plowed under...|$|E
40|$|Nitrate {{contamination}} of surface waters {{has been linked}} to irrigated agriculture across the world. We determined the NO 3 –N loads in the drainage waters of two sprinkler-irrigated watersheds located in the Ebro River basin (Spain) and their relationship to irrigation and N management. Crop water requirements, irrigation, N fertilization, and the volume and NO 3 –N concentration of drainage waters were measured or estimated during two-year (Watershed A; 494 irrigated ha) and one-year (Watershed B; 470 irrigated ha) study periods. Maize (Zea mays L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) were grown in 40 to 60 % and 15 to 33 % of the irrigated areas, respectively. The seasonal irrigation performance index (IPI) ranged from 92 to 100 %, indicating high-quality management of irrigation. However, the IPI varied among fields and <b>overirrigation</b> occurred in 17 to 44 % of the area. Soil and maize stalk nitrate contents measured at harvest indicated that N fertilizer rates could be decreased. Drainage flows were 68 mm yr- 1 in Watershed A and 194 mm yr- 1 in Watershed B. Drainage NO 3 –N concentrations were independent of drainage flows and similar in the irrigated and nonirrigated periods (average: 23 – 29 mg L- 1). Drainage flows determined the exported mass of NO 3 –N, which varied from 18 (Watershed A) to 49 (Watershed B) kg ha- 1 yr- 1, representing 8 (Watershed A) and 22 % (Watershed B) of the applied fertilizer plus manure N. High-quality irrigation management coupled to the split application of N through the sprinkler systems allowed a reasonable compromise between profitability and reduced N pollution in irrigation return flows.

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} water use of different plant types in urban landscapes, nitrogen (N) and water transport in turf, and potential N leaching from urban landscapes to ground water. In the first study, three landscape treatments integrating {{different types of}} plants—woody, herbaceous perennial, turf—and putative water use classifications—Mesic, Mixed, Xeric—were grown in large drainage lysimeters. Each landscape plot was divided into woody, turf, and herbaceous perennial plant hydrozones and irrigated for optimum water status over two years, with water use measured using a water balance approach. For woody plants and herbaceous perennials, canopy cover, rather than plant type or water use classification, was the key determinant of water use relative to reference evapotranspiration (ETo) under well-watered conditions. For turf, monthly evapotranspiration (ETa) followed a trend linearly related to ETo. In the second study, water transport parameters were calibrated using an inverse simulation with Kentucky bluegrass (KBG). Subsequently, those parameters were applied to simulate water use by tall fescue (TF) and buffalograss (BG) turfgrasses using numerical modeling (Hydrus- 1 D). By using the calibrated soil hydraulic parameters obtained from the water transport simulation, N transport and transformation was modeled with Hydrus- 1 D under different irrigation rates and different fertilization rates. Different soil texture scenarios were also simulated to demonstrate the influence of soil texture on N leaching. In the third study, the simulated N-leaching from different soil textures was integrated into a Geographic Information System (GIS) approach to estimate NO 3 -N leaching mass from urban turf areas. Nitrate-N leaching risks to ground water under <b>overirrigation</b> and overfertilization scenarios and efficient irrigation and fertilization scenarios were estimated. The results showed improvement of turf irrigation and fertilization management may decrease N-leaching significantly and greatly decrease the risk of ground water being contaminated by NO 3 -N leaching in the Salt Lake Valley...|$|E
40|$|Anomalous {{concentrations}} of silica in ground {{water of the}} eastern San Joaquin Valley originate from several diverse sources and are subsequently modified by recharge or diagenesis. Statistics, geochemical models, and column studies identified potential sources of silica in ground water and those parameters most important in influencing its distribution. Principal components analysis indicated inverse time and potassium as the parameters which best relate to silica. Inverse time relates to ground-water recharge while potassium relates to either the rhyolitic Friant Pumice, the hardpans of the eastern San Joaquin Valley, or diagenetic losses. A lumped parameter model suggests that recharge {{is responsible for the}} drop in silica concentrations beneath Fresno since 1971. The Madera County model indicates higher silica concentrations associated with the Friant Pumice, older geologic units with hardpans, finer grained sediments, and areas of ground-water discharge. Lower silica concentrations are associated with unweathered sediments, areas receiving recharge, and areas underlain by the Corcoran Clay. Column leaching studies produced silica concentrations from the Friant Pumice of up to 90 mg/ 1, Turlock Lake and Riverbank Formation hardpans from 40 - 50 mg/ 1, and younger Modesto Formation sediments from 10 - 40 mg/l. Spatially, volcanogenic sediments impart the highest silica concentrations to the ground water, 70 - 95 mg/ 1, and occur along the eastern margin of the valley, north of the San Joaquin River, or in San Joaquin River fluvial deposits. Iron-silica hardpans, found at various depths along {{the east side of the}} valley, are associated with silica {{concentrations of}} 40 - 70 mg/l. The typical arkosic sediments of the eastern valley have silica concentrations of 20 - 40 mg/l. Silica concentrations in ground water are modified by recharge and diagenetic processes. Either natural or artificial recharge having 4 - 16 mg/ 1 silica may lower ambient silica concentrations in ground water. Recharge occurs beneath some rivers and in transmissive paleochannel deposits; artificial sources include agricultural <b>overirrigation</b> and basin recharge. The down-gradient loss of silica to the sedimentary column, more prevalent at depth, apparently is by the sorption of silica on clays, the formation of clays, or deposition of amorphous silica...|$|E
40|$|Arizona {{is ranked}} {{third in the}} nation in fresh {{vegetable}} production, however, overfertilization and <b>overirrigation</b> have been common practices used to maintain adequate yields and crop quality. Concern for groundwater contamination, water availability and costs have made it necessary to increase water and nitrogen (N) use efficiency. The objectives of this research were: 1. optimize water and N inputs applied through a subsurface trickle irrigation system to leaf lettuce, spinach and collards. 2. evaluate water and N effects on midrib nitrate (NO₃-N) concentration as a tool for monitoring plant N status throughout the growing season. A field experiment was conducted during fall-winter 1992 - 93 at the University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center, Maricopa, AZ. A factorial design with three target soil water potentials and four N levels was used to determine response surfaces for yield, net return, and water and N use efficiency. Tensiometers were used as an aid to schedule irrigations, and midrib NO₃-N concentrations at critical growth stages were used to monitor N status. Spinach and collard midrib N 03 -N concentrations showed a high response to N rates throughout the growing season. Leaf lettuce midrib NO₃-N was responsive to treatments {{at the beginning and end}} of its growing season. Some yield and efficiency parameters were significantly affected by the irrigation treatments with an effect generally negative. Nitrogen had tremendous influence on them, perhaps due to the wet seasonal conditions which may have promoted nitrate leaching and denitrification. For leaf lettuce, maximum fresh weight was estimated to be 60861 kg ha⁻¹ at - 4. 3 kPa soil water potential and 367 kg N ha⁻¹. Maximum net return was estimated to be $ 18, 089 ha⁻¹ when average soil water potential was - 6. 0 kPa and applied N was 355 kg N ha⁻¹. Estimated maximum nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) was 0. 8 at - 10. 3 kPa soil water potential, and 2 kg N ha⁻¹. It was not possible to determine a maximum value for applied water use efficiency (A WUE). For spinach, maximum yield was estimated to be 33948 kg ha⁻¹ at - 8. 0 kPa soil water potential and 400 kg N ha⁻¹. Estimated net return was $ 18, 573 ha⁻¹ when soil water potential and applied N rate were - 8. 2 kPa and 398 kg N ha⁻¹ respectively.

40|$|The São Francisco River basin in Brazil {{is marked}} by {{socio-economic}} disparities and environrnental vulnerabilities. Water managers in the semi-arid region of the basin are faced with several challenges, such as competition among different water user groups, local over-exploitation of aquifers, c 1 imateand land use changes, non-source pollution, erosion, and sedimentation. Water policy makers {{have to work out}} strategies for integrated water management, which rely on a proper knowledge base of the physical conditions encountered in the basin. The intensification of horticulture in the semi-arid north-eastem region of Brazil replaces natural vegetation (i. e. caatinga) by irrigated fruit crops. A proper knowledge of the water balance from these different agro-ecosystems is an essential pre-requisite for sound water resources planning in the basin context. Because of the importance of agricultural water management practices on basin hydrology, daily and seasonal actualK. nowledge of spatially variable actual evapotranspiration can help to optimize the necessary reduction in irrigation supplies. evapotranspiration were measured in irrigated crops, along with experimental data collection over caatinga. Advanced radiation andenergy balance measurements were conducted using the Bowen ratio and eddy correlation energy balance methods. Remote sensing algorithms are potentially suitable for the extrapolation of these local fluxes on a regional scale, and the opportunities of these tools were investigated. The key crop water parameters identified from this data set inc 1 uded actual evapotranspiration, actual transpiration, actual soil evaporation, evaporative fractions, aerodynamic resistances, surface resistances, crop coefficients, percolation fluxes and water productivity. The energy balance measurements on the irrigated fields revealed high evaporative fractions, which pointed out that soils are very wet and that large majority of the net available energy is converted into latent heat fluxoThe average crop water consumption in wine grape were found to be 478 mm per growing season, while table grapes show 373 mm per growing season. The seasonal accumulated values for mango orchardswere typical 1 y 1419 mm. On average the caatinga natural ecosystem evapotranspirated only 533 mm yr-I. The irrigation induced an incremental evapotranspiration of 2. 2 mm d-I or 8, 030 m 3 ha-I yr-I. The water balances revealed that systematic over-irrigation is a common practice and that a continuous deep percolation flux occurs. The detailed results allowed expressing water consumption into specific bio-physical parameters, rather than only into more generic crop coefficients that lump together several individual crop water parameters. The stomata o irrigated crops seem to respond very tight 1 y to atmospheric vapour pressure deficit while natural vegetation responds to the rainfall regime. The field results have been used further to calibrate and validate an existing remote sensing algorithm for the estimation of spatially distributed energy balance fluxes: the Surface Energy Balance AIgoritlun for Land (SEBAL). It was shown that it is required to apply the hot and cold pixel calibration for every individual image. A generic solution for the internal calibration of the sensible heat flux through the linear relationship between surface radiation temperature and vertical air temperature differences adjacent to the land surface could not be found. For daily scale, the values of the instantaneous evaporative fraction needed to be adjusted. The difference between field measurements and SEBAL was 4. 4 % and 0. 6 % for natural vegetation and irrigated mango orchard, respectively, for annual scale. Further to the estimate of depleted water volumes in irrigated horticulture, it was investigated whether the incremental evapotranspiration values are productive. After calibration, the SEBAL algorithm was applied to determine regional scale evapotranspiration and biomass production. The remote sensing tools shows spatial variation of crop water productivity values and detects regions and farms where water can be saved. The net water withdrawal in the Low-Middle São Francisco River basin was also estimated. The biophysical water productivity based on actual evapotranspiration appeared to be around 0. 90 L m- 3, 2. 80 kg m- 3 and 3. 4 kg m- 3 for respectively wine grapes, table grapes, and mangos. The economic water productivities indicated that irrigated fruit crops have around 20 times more value per unit water consumed than irrigated arable crops. The area with fruit crops in the semi-arid region of the Low-Middle São Francisco River basin are expanding mainly with vineyards and mango orchards. The crop water consumption is high due to <b>overirrigation</b> together with high thermal availability. The water is, however, productively used and creates a boost for the rural economy. The drawback is that agricultural drainage can adversely affect the water quality, and this requires a lower irrigation supply in the near-future. K. nowledge of spatially variable actual evapotranspiration can help to optimize the necessary reduction in irrigation supplies. 2008 Tese (Doutorado em Socio-Economic and Natural Sciences of the Environment) - Wageningen University, Wageningen...|$|E
