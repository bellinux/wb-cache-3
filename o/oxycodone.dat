5|$|A {{report of}} her autopsy was {{released}} in December 2016. Laurer died on April 20 of an overdose of alcohol, combined with the anxiety drugs diazepam and nordazepam, painkillers <b>oxycodone</b> and oxymorphone, and sleeping aid temazepam.|$|E
5|$|During the trial, she {{was accused}} of using drugs, {{including}} <b>oxycodone,</b> diazepam and Vicodin (hydrocodone/APAP) without valid prescriptions. Ryder was convicted of grand theft, shoplifting and vandalism but was acquitted on the third felony charge, burglary. In December 2002, she was sentenced to three years' probation, 480 hours of community service, $3,700 in fines, and $6,355 in restitution to the Saks Fifth Avenue store and ordered to attend psychological and drug counseling. After reviewing Ryder's probation report, Superior Court Judge Elden Fox noted that Ryder served 480hours of community service and on June 18, 2004, the felonies were reduced to misdemeanors. Ryder remained on probation until December 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Todd {{returns to}} Llanview {{to check on}} Dani, who had {{previously}} phoned him several times. He witnesses Dani collapse from a drug overdose due to her abuse of <b>oxycodone.</b> While she is recovering at the hospital, an alive Victor arrives. A surprised Téa, Dani, and Jack welcome Victor back, while Todd tries to bond with his children. Todd remains concerned about Jack and Dani, attempting to buy their affections with money and deciding {{the best way to}} win them over is to call a truce with Victor. He also tries to win back Blair's affections. He eventually admits he only pretended to get along with Victor to lure him into a false sense of security. Victor admits that he poisoned Todd's scotch with arsenic and then tried to strangle him. Jack takes Todd to the hospital, where he recovers but is frustrated when his family continues to defend Victor. Victor realizes he must leave town and says goodbye to his family. Todd shows Blair a threatening note he received with the names of all his loved ones on it. The mysterious Tattoo Organization that held Victor demands that Todd find and kill Victor. Todd, Blair and Téa devise a scheme to fool this organization into believing Victor is dead. Feeling secure that their scheme has worked, they plan for a future. Todd receives another note by the Tattoo Organization, this time telling him that he failed them and that Victor has been recaptured. Todd is told that he must leave Llanview and go to the address given on the note. Todd and Blair are devastated. Todd says goodbye to Viki and his children, but does not tell them the real reason he is leaving is to protect their family. Before Todd leaves, he and Blair make love one last time, and it is revealed that they have remarried.|$|E
25|$|In humans, N-demethylation of <b>oxycodone</b> to noroxycodone by CYP3A4 is {{the major}} {{metabolic}} pathway, accounting for 45% ± 21% of a dose of <b>oxycodone,</b> while O-demethylation of <b>oxycodone</b> into oxymorphone by CYP2D6 and 6-ketoreduction of <b>oxycodone</b> into 6-oxycodols represent relatively minor metabolic pathways, accounting for 11% ± 6% and 8% ± 6% of a dose of <b>oxycodone,</b> respectively.|$|E
25|$|Opioid-related {{deaths in}} Ontario had {{increased}} by 242% from 1969 to 2014. By 2009 in Ontario {{there were more}} deaths from <b>oxycodone</b> overdose than from cocaine overdose. Deaths from opioid pain relievers had increased from 13.7 deaths per million residents in 1991 to 27.2 deaths per million residents in 2004. The abuse of <b>oxycodone</b> in Canada became a problem. Areas where <b>oxycodone</b> is most problematic are Atlantic Canada and Ontario, where its abuse is prevalent in rural towns, and in many smaller to medium-sized cities. <b>Oxycodone</b> is also widely available across Western Canada, but methamphetamine and heroin are more serious problems in the larger cities, while <b>oxycodone</b> {{is more common in}} rural towns. <b>Oxycodone</b> is diverted through doctor shopping, prescription forgery, pharmacy theft, and overprescribing.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxycodone</b> and/or {{its major}} {{metabolites}} may {{be measured in}} blood or urine to monitor for clearance, abuse, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Many commercial opiate screening tests cross-react appreciably with <b>oxycodone</b> and its metabolites, but chromatographic techniques can easily distinguish <b>oxycodone</b> from other opiates.|$|E
25|$|Taken orally, 20mg of {{immediate}} release <b>oxycodone</b> {{is equivalent to}} 30mg of morphine. Extended release <b>oxycodone</b> {{is considered to be}} twice as potent as oral morphine.|$|E
25|$|A {{few of the}} {{metabolites}} of <b>oxycodone</b> {{have also}} {{been found to be}} active as MOR agonists, some of which notably have much higher affinity for (as well as higher efficacy at) the MOR in comparison. Oxymorphone possesses 3- to 5-fold higher affinity for the MOR than does <b>oxycodone,</b> while noroxycodone and noroxymorphone possess one-third of and 3-fold higher affinity for the MOR, respectively, and MOR activation is 5- to 10-fold less with noroxycodone but 2-fold higher with noroxymorphone relative to <b>oxycodone.</b> Noroxycodone, noroxymorphone, and oxymorphone also have longer half-lives than <b>oxycodone.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxycodone</b> is {{available}} as controlled-release tablet, {{intended to be}} taken every 12 hours. A 2006 review found that controlled-release <b>oxycodone</b> is comparable to instant-release <b>oxycodone,</b> morphine, and hydromorphone in management of moderate to severe cancer pain, with fewer side effects than morphine. The author concluded that the controlled release form is a valid alternative to morphine and a first-line treatment for cancer pain. In 2014, the European Association for Palliative Care recommended oral <b>oxycodone</b> as a second-line alternative to oral morphine for cancer pain.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, <b>oxycodone</b> is only {{approved}} for oral use, available as tablets and oral solutions. In Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, <b>oxycodone</b> is also {{approved for}} intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) use. When first introduced in Germany during World War I, both IV and IM administrations of <b>oxycodone</b> {{were commonly used}} for postoperative pain management of Central Powers soldiers.|$|E
25|$|However, {{despite the}} greater in vitro {{activity}} {{of some of}} its metabolites, it has been determined that <b>oxycodone</b> itself is responsible for 83.0% and 94.8% of its analgesic effect following oral and intravenous administration, respectively. Oxymorphone plays only a minor role, being responsible for 15.8% and 4.5% of the analgesic effect of <b>oxycodone</b> after oral and intravenous administration, respectively. Although the CYP2D6 genotype and the route of administration result in differential rates of oxymorphone formation, the unchanged parent compound remains the major contributor to the overall analgesic effect of <b>oxycodone.</b> In contrast to <b>oxycodone</b> and oxymorphone, noroxycodone and noroxymorphone, while also potent MOR agonists, poorly cross the blood-brain-barrier into the central nervous system, and for this reason, are only minimally analgesic in comparison. In accordance, while higher CYP2D6 activity increases the effects of <b>oxycodone</b> (owing to increased conversion into oxymorphone), higher CYP3A4 activity has the opposite effect, and decreases the effects of <b>oxycodone</b> (owing to increased metabolism into noroxycodone and noroxymorphone).|$|E
25|$|Ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir greatly {{increase}} plasma concentrations of <b>oxycodone</b> in healthy human volunteers due to inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6. Rifampicin greatly reduces plasma concentrations of <b>oxycodone</b> due to strong induction of CYP3A4. There {{is also a}} case report of fosphenytoin, a CYP3A4 inducer, dramatically reducing the analgesic effects of <b>oxycodone</b> in a chronic pain patient. Dosage or medication adjustments may be necessary in each case.|$|E
25|$|After {{a dose of}} {{conventional}} (instant-release) oral <b>oxycodone,</b> the onset of action is 10–30 minutes, and peak plasma levels of the drug are attained within roughly 30–60 minutes; in contrast, after a dose of OxyContin (an oral controlled-release formulation), peak plasma levels of <b>oxycodone</b> occur in about three hours. The duration of instant-release <b>oxycodone</b> is 3 to 6 hours, although this can be variable depending on the individual.|$|E
25|$|The non-medical use of <b>oxycodone</b> existed {{from the}} early 1970s, but by 2015, 91% of a {{national}} sample of injecting drug users in Australia had reported using <b>oxycodone,</b> and 27% had injected it {{in the last six}} months.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxycodone</b> can be {{administered}} orally, intranasally, via intravenous, intramuscular, or subcutaneous injection, or rectally. The bioavailability of oral administration of <b>oxycodone</b> averages 60–87%, with rectal administration yielding the same results; intranasal varies between {{individuals with a}} mean of 46%.|$|E
25|$|Similarly to {{most other}} opioids, <b>oxycodone</b> {{increases}} prolactin secretion, but {{its influence on}} testosterone levels is unknown. Unlike morphine, <b>oxycodone</b> lacks immunosuppressive activity (measured by natural killer cell activity and interleukin 2 production in vitro); the clinical relevance of {{this has not been}} clarified.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{research}} by a Japanese group suggested {{the effect of}} <b>oxycodone</b> is mediated by different receptors in different situations. Specifically in diabetic mice, the κ-opioid receptor appears {{to be involved in}} the antinociceptive effects of <b>oxycodone,</b> while in nondiabetic mice, the μ1-opioid receptor seems to be primarily responsible for these effects.|$|E
25|$|In 1997, a {{group of}} Australian {{researchers}} proposed (based on a study in rats) that <b>oxycodone</b> acts on KORs, unlike morphine, which acts upon MORs. Further research by this group indicated the drug {{appears to be a}} κ2b-opioid agonist. However, this conclusion has been disputed, primarily on the basis that <b>oxycodone</b> produces effects that are typical of μ-opioid agonists.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxycodone</b> is {{a highly}} {{selective}} full agonist of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR), with low affinity for the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) and κ-opioid receptor (KOR). After <b>oxycodone</b> binds to the MOR, a G protein-complex is released, which inhibits the release of neurotransmitters by the cell by {{reducing the amount of}} cAMP produced, closing calcium channels, and opening potassium channels.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxycodone</b> is a {{restricted}} drug in Japan. Its import and export is strictly restricted to specially designated organizations having prior permit to import it. In a high-profile case an American {{who was a}} top Toyota executive living in Tokyo, {{who claimed to be}} unaware of the law, was arrested for importing <b>oxycodone</b> into Japan.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxycodone</b> is metabolized by the {{cytochrome}} P450 enzyme {{system in}} the liver, making it vulnerable to drug interactions. Some people are fast metabolizers, resulting in reduced analgesic effect, but increased adverse effects, while others are slow metabolisers, resulting in increased toxicity without improved analgesia. The dose of <b>oxycodone</b> must be reduced in patients with reduced hepatic function.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the United States {{government}} classified <b>oxycodone</b> as a schedule II drug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxycodone</b> is a {{controlled}} substance under Schedule I of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA).|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxycodone</b> is metabolized by the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6, and its {{clearance}} {{therefore can}} be altered by inhibitors and inducers of these enzymes. (For lists of CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 inhibitors and inducers, see here and here, respectively.) Natural genetic variation in these enzymes can also influence the clearance of <b>oxycodone,</b> which {{may be related to}} the wide inter-individual variability in its half-life and potency.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxycodone</b> is {{regulated}} under Part I of Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance.|$|E
25|$|Parenteral {{formulations}} of <b>oxycodone</b> (brand name OxyNorm) are also available, and {{are widely used}} in Europe.|$|E
25|$|As {{with other}} opioids, chronic use of <b>oxycodone</b> (particularly with higher doses) often causes {{concurrent}} hypogonadism or hormone imbalance.|$|E
25|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} {{have also}} been reported in newborns whose mothers had been either injecting or orally taking <b>oxycodone</b> during pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxycodone</b> and its {{metabolites}} {{are mainly}} excreted {{in the urine}} and sweat; therefore, it accumulates in patients with kidney impairment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxycodone</b> is a semisynthetic opioid {{synthesized}} from thebaine, an opioid alkaloid {{found in}} the Persian poppy, {{and one of the}} many alkaloids {{found in the}} opium poppy. It is a moderately potent opioid analgesic (orally roughly 1.5 to 3 times more potent than morphine), generally indicated for relief of moderate to severe pain. <b>Oxycodone</b> was developed in 1917 in Germany as one of several semi-synthetic opioids in an attempt to improve on the existing opioids.|$|E
25|$|<b>Oxycodone</b> is {{marketed as}} various salts, most {{commonly}} as the hydrochloride salt. The free base conversion ratios of different salts are: hydrochloride (0.896), bitartrate (0.667), tartrate (0.750), camphosulphonate (0.576), pectinate (0.588), phenylpriopionate (0.678), sulphate (0.887), phosphate (0.763), and terephthalate (0.792). The hydrochloride salt {{is the basis}} of most American <b>oxycodone</b> products whilst bitartrate, tartrate, pectinate, terephthalate and phosphate salts are also available in European products. Methyiodide and hydroiodide are mentioned in older European publications.|$|E
25|$|People on {{high-dose}} buprenorphine therapy may be {{unaffected by}} even large doses of opioids such as <b>oxycodone,</b> morphine, or hydromorphone.|$|E
25|$|Serious {{side effects}} of <b>oxycodone</b> include reduced {{sensitivity}} to pain (beyond the pain the drug is taken to reduce), euphoria, anxiolysis, feelings of relaxation, and respiratory depression. Common {{side effects of}} <b>oxycodone</b> include constipation (23%), nausea (23%), vomiting (12%), somnolence (23%), dizziness (13%), itching (13%), dry mouth (6%), and sweating (5%). Less common side effects (experienced by less than 5% of patients) include loss of appetite, nervousness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, urine retention, dyspnea, and hiccups.|$|E
25|$|Under the Controlled Substances Act, {{enacted in}} 1971 by President Richard Nixon, <b>oxycodone</b> is a Schedule II {{controlled}} substance whether by itself {{or part of}} a multi-ingredient medication. The DEA lists <b>oxycodone</b> both for sale and for use in manufacturing other opioids as ACSCN 9143 and in 2013 approved the following annual aggregate manufacturing quotas: 131.5 metric tons for sale, down from 153.75 in 2012, and 10.25 metric tons for conversion, unchanged from the previous year.|$|E
25|$|There {{are a few}} {{case reports}} that <b>oxycodone</b> may have {{antidepressant}} effects in some individuals with severe, treatment-resistant major depressive disorder.|$|E
25|$|The first {{clinical}} {{use of the}} drug was documented in 1917, the year after it was first developed. It was first introduced to the US market in May 1939. In early 1928, Merck introduced a combination product containing scopolamine, <b>oxycodone,</b> and ephedrine under the German initials for the ingredients SEE, which was later renamed Scophedal (SCOpolamine ePHEDrine and eukodAL). This combination is essentially an <b>oxycodone</b> analogue of the morphine-based ´twilight sleep´, with ephedrine added to reduce circulatory and respiratory effects.|$|E
