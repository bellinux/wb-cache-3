40|$|Purpose: The paper {{discusses}} {{the validity of}} the thesis according to which Polish <b>budgetary</b> <b>framework</b> in place in 2011 required only minor adjustments in order to be consistent with the principles set forth in the EU Council Directive on requirements for <b>budgetary</b> <b>frameworks</b> of Member States adopted in November 2011. Basic elements of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>framework</b> laid down in the Directive had already been provided for in Polish law. Methodology: A comparative analysis of the provisions of the Directive with relevant acts of Polish legislation, including the Public Finance Act, was carried out. The author outlines the Polish <b>budgetary</b> <b>framework</b> before 2011 and the most important adjustments introduced by the end of 2013 {{on the basis of the}} <b>budgetary</b> <b>framework</b> structure set forth in the Directive. Findings: The assessment of the convergence of provisions encompassed definitions, accounting, statistics, forecasts, numerical fiscal rules, medium-term <b>budgetary</b> <b>frameworks,</b> transparency and consistency. Its results demonstrate that Polish regulations complied with the provisions of the Directive. In order to confirm their correctness, an assessment of the practical application of recent adjustments, which entered into force in 2014, must be carried out. Constraints to research: The analysis addresses the main concepts and their most important characteristics, and therefore a synthetic approach to the subject required omitting a number of specific issues. Originality: The paper analyses the convergence of the Polish <b>budgetary</b> <b>framework</b> in 2011 and its subsequent adjustments to the provisions of the Directive of the EU Council requiring Member States to amend their legislation by the end of 2013. ...|$|R

This {{can be achieved by}} taking legislative and institutional measures, such as a new law on fiscal responsibility, developing a long-term fiscal strategy, moving to a multi-annual budget programming by implementing a medium-term <b>budgetary</b> <b>framework,</b> the introduction of strict fiscal rules and the establishment of an Independent Fiscal Council.

40|$|This study {{considers}} {{the potential for}} the implementation of performance budgeting within the Maltese public sector, exploring the pressures which support and inhibit this reform, proposing a possible implementation approach and identifying the issues surrounding the implementation of changes to the budgetary system. The study also seeks to identify the recent reforms of the <b>budgetary</b> <b>framework,</b> which have occurred since the change in government in March 2013. Change is inevitable as the government is committed to meet specific targets for fiscal deficit and debt reduction, in line with its EU obligations. The research follows a qualitative approach, using data gathered from documentary sources, corroborated with empirical evidence collected from in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Access has been obtained to discuss relevant issues with senior politicians from the government and the opposition, including former ministers and Prime Ministers. The findings indicate {{that there are a number}} of macro-level and institutional pressures acting as triggers for the implementation of budgetary reform; at the same time, there are elements constituting resistance to change which have to be tackled should government intend to change the <b>budgetary</b> <b>framework.</b> A combined approach, with more emphasis on the bottom-up perspective, is recommended for the implementation of performance budgeting. ...|$|R
