25|$|The BLM {{designated}} the Oregon Badlands a wilderness study area in 1980, and proposed federal wilderness designation for the Oregon Badlands in 1989.

25|$|Oceano Dunes State Vehicular Recreation Area {{is located}} south of Oceano. It {{consists}} {{of five and}} half miles of beach open for vehicle use and a large area of the sand dunes open for <b>off-highway</b> vehicle use, including quads, dirt-bikes, and four-wheel drive vehicles.

The park also offers guests the ability to camp on the beach itself. Other activities available at the park include horseback riding and bird watching.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) has {{a number}} of habitat {{conservation}} programs in effect which includes lands traditionally inhabited by the Mission blue butterfly. A recovery plan, drawn up by the USFWS in 1984, outlined the need to protect Mission blue habitat and to repair habitat damaged by urbanization, <b>off-highway</b> vehicle traffic, and invasion by exotic, non-native plants. An example of the type of work being done by governmental and citizen agencies {{can be found in the}} Marin Headlands at Golden Gate National Recreation Area. In addition, regular wildfires have opened new habitat conservation opportunities, as well as damaging existing ones.|$|E
25|$|The route {{recommended}} {{was similar}} to the 1985 proposal. The line would have traveled across the Kaingaroa Plains and followed the route more or less presently taken by the private forestry road, High Level Road. Stage one of the proposal would terminate at the junction between the two private forestry roads, High Level Road and the <b>Off-Highway</b> road leading from the Taupo Mill, near the State Highway 5 Napier-Taupo road. A recommendation was made that a log-processing yard be built at the junction of these two roads in conjunction with the rail line extension from Murupara.|$|E

500|$|The parkway {{begins at}} an {{incomplete}} interchange with I-215 in extreme northern Salt Lake County near the Jordan River <b>Off-Highway</b> Vehicle State Recreation Area. The interchange allows motorists from the Interstate to transfer onto Legacy Parkway and travelers to access I-215 southbound. After about , Legacy Parkway enters Davis County, and heads northerly with two lanes {{in each direction}} through semi-rural Woods Cross. The parkway then turns northeasterly and back north again, meeting 500South at a diamond interchange, which also provides a connection to Redwood Road (SR-68). The eastern border of the Legacy Nature Preserve is formed by the parkway as it travels north. In West Bountiful, the parkway curves to the northeast as it follows the contour of the wetlands which lie {{on the western side}} of the road. Before reverting to its original northerly direction, the route intersects Parrish Lane (SR-105) at another diamond interchange. Past the intersection, Union Pacific and Utah Transit Authority (FrontRunner) railroad tracks run between the parkway and I-15 to the east. For the remainder of the parkway's length, I-15 is located approximately [...] east. Upon entering Farmington, the parkway gains one lane in each direction and terminates at a triple-junction with I-15, SR-225 and U.S. Route89 west of Lagoon. This interchange {{is referred to as the}} Wasatch Weave.|$|E
2500|$|Following the eclipse, {{more than}} 500,000 {{vehicles}} traveled Wyoming roads, creating large traffic jams, particularly on southbound and eastbound highways. Drivers {{reported that it}} took up to 10 hours to travel [...] into northern Colorado. There was one traffic fatality, and another fatality related to an <b>off-highway</b> ATV accident, but in general there were far fewer incidents and traffic citations than authorities had anticipated.|$|E

2500|$|At this time, {{agricultural}} implement production declined, which led the earth moving and tractor equipment companies to skyrocket and make Peoria {{in this field}} the world leader. In 1925, Caterpillar Tractor Co. was formed from the Benjamin Holt Co. and the C.L. Best Tractor Co. Robert G. LeTourneau's earth moving company began its production of new scrapers and dozers in 1935 which evolved into Komatsu-Dresser, Haulpak Division.
