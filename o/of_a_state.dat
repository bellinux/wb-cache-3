5|$|A {{cellular}} automaton {{consists of an}} array of cells, each one of which has {{a finite number of}} possible states, together with a rule for updating all cells simultaneously based only on the states of neighboring cells. A configuration of a {{cellular automaton}} is an assignment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> to every cell of the automaton; the update rule of a cellular automaton forms a function from configurations to configurations, with the requirement that the updated value of any cell depends only on some finite neighborhood of the cell, and that the function is invariant under translations of the input array.|$|E
5|$|A {{constitutional}} {{convention was}} convened in Salt Lake City on March 8, 1849, {{to work on}} a proposal for federal recognition <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> or territory. The convention resulted in the provisional State of Deseret. Deseret claimed most of present-day Utah, Nevada and Arizona, with parts of California, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Oregon, and Wyoming. Brigham Young was elected governor on March 12, 1849, and the legislature first met on July 2, 1849. The state, having never been recognized by the federal government, was formally dissolved on April 5, 1851, several months after word of the creation of Utah Territory reached Salt Lake City.|$|E

5|$|After the {{convention}} many Conservative Democrats, though not happy at Tillman's victory, acknowledged him {{as head of}} the state party. Those who submitted to Tillman's rule included Hampton and Butler, the state's two U.S. senators. In his campaign, Tillman promoted support for Clemson, establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> women's college, reapportionment of the state legislature (then dominated by the lowcountry counties), and ending the influence of corporation lawyers in that body.|$|E
5|$|Also in the 1878 session, tax {{assessments}} for railroad property {{were raised}} to match {{those of other}} property. Agrarian interests were pleased that the legal interest rate was again lowered, now reaching the six percent they had proposed in the previous session. Non-economic reforms included the separation of Kentucky Agricultural and Mechanical College (later the University of Kentucky) from Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) and the establishment <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> board of health. Bills of local import again dominated the session, representing 90 percent of the acts and resolutions passed by the Assembly.|$|E

5|$|Beriah Magoffin (April 18, 1815 – February 28, 1885) was the 21st Governor of Kentucky, serving {{during the}} early part of the Civil War. Personally, Magoffin adhered to a states' rights position, {{including}} the right <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> to secede from the Union, and he sympathized with the Confederate cause. Nevertheless, when the Kentucky General Assembly adopted a position of neutrality in the war, Magoffin ardently held to it, refusing calls for aid from both the Union and Confederate governments.|$|E
5|$|Buckner {{proposed}} {{a number of}} progressive ideas, {{most of which were}} rejected by the legislature.

His failed proposals included creation of a department of justice, greater local support for education and better protection for forests.|$|E
5|$|Generally {{a friend}} of {{organized}} labor, Chandler supported miners' efforts to unionize, organized the state Department of Industrial Relations, and prohibited mine operators from being appointed as deputy sheriffs.

5|$|In 1817, Sharp {{was again}} {{elected to the}} Kentucky House of Representatives.

5|$|In 1819, {{the state}} seal was part <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> crisis.

5|$|In 1913, {{representative}} William J.

The campaign for a state flag, however, was opposed by patriotic groups like the Sons of the American Revolution and Sons of Veterans, finding the use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>state</b> flag to be detrimental to the national flag.|$|E

This group investigated the forty existing engineering experiment stations at universities around the country, and a report was compiled by Harold Bunger, Montgomery Knight, and Vaughan in December 1929.
