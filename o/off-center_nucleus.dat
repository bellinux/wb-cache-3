40|$|The {{center of}} M 83, a barred starburst galaxy {{with a double}} nucleus, has been {{observed}} in the CO(J= 2 – 1) and CO(J= 3 – 2) lines with the Submillimeter Array. The molecular gas shows a distribution and kinematics typical for barred galaxies at ∼kpc radii, but reveals unusual kinematics around the double nucleus in the central ∼ 300 pc. Our CO velocity data show that the visible nucleus in M 83 is at least 3 ′ ′ (65 pc) away from the galaxy’s dynamical center, which most likely coincides with the center of symmetry previously determined in K band and is suggested to host another nucleus. We discovered high-velocity molecular gas associated with the visible <b>off-center</b> <b>nucleus,</b> and also found a steep velocity gradient across it. We attribute these features to a gas disk rotating around the <b>off-center</b> <b>nucleus,</b> {{which may be the}} remnant of a small galaxy accreted by M 83. The dynamical mass of this component is estimated to be 3 × 10 8 M ⊙ within a radius of 40 pc. The dynamical perturbation from the <b>off-center</b> <b>nucleus</b> may have {{played a key role in}} shaping the lopsided starburst.

40|$|We have {{detected}} extremely wide (1100 km s− 1) CO(1 – 0) emission from NGC 1144, an interacting, luminous infrared galaxy {{that is the}} dominant component of the Arp 118 system. The observations show that NGC 1144 {{is one of the}} most CO luminous galaxies in the local universe, with a CO luminosity twice that of Arp 220. Maps with the IRAM interferometer show that the CO is not in or very near the Seyfert 2 nucleus, but in the 20 kpc diameter ring that extends halfway between NGC 1144 and the elliptical galaxy NGC 1143. The greatest gas concentration, with 40 % of the CO luminosity, is in the southern part of the ring, in NGC 1144. Another 15 % of the CO luminosity comes from the dominant 10 µm source, a giant extranuclear HII region. The ring of molecular gas, the <b>off-center</b> <b>nucleus,</b> the ring extending halfway to the intruder, and the velocity of the intruder nearly equal to the escape velocity all show that Arp 118 is a ring galaxy produced by a collision of a massive spiral with an elliptical. The most spectacular property is the velocity range, which in Arp 118 is 2 to 3 times higher than in a typical ring galaxy. Arp 118 is a rare example of a very luminous extended starburst with a scale of about 5 – 10 kpc, and a luminosit...|$|E
40|$|Aims. We {{report the}} first study of the {{peculiar}} ring-like galaxy HRG 2304 (NED 02),which was previously classified as a ring galaxy with an elliptical smooth ring. This object was selected {{to prove that it}} is a candidate for the Solitaire-type ring galaxies in an early stage of ring formation. The main goal of this work is to provide the spectral characteristics of the current object and its companion AM 1646 - 795 (NED 01). Methods. The study is based on spectroscopic observations in the optical band to highlight the characteristics of this interacting galaxy. To investigate the star formation history of HRG 2304 we used the stellar population synthesis code STARLIGHT. The direct V and B broad band images were used to enhance some fine structures. Results. Along the entire long-slit signal, the spectra of HRG 2304 and its companion resemble that of an early-type galaxy. We estimated a heliocentric systemic redshift of z = 0. 0415, corresponding to heliocentric velocities of 12449 km s- 1 for HRG 2304 (NED 02) and 12430 km s- 1 for AM 1646 - 795 (NED 01). The spatial variation in the contribution of the stellar population components for both objects are dominated by an old stellar population 2 x 10 ^ 9 < t < 13 x 10 ^ 9 yr. The observed radial-velocity distribution and the fine structures around HRG 2304 suggest an ongoing tidal interaction of both galaxies. Conclusions. The spectroscopic results and the morphological peculiarities of HRG 2304 can be adequately interpreted as an ongoing interaction with the companion galaxy. Both galaxies are early-type, the companion is elliptical, and the smooth distribution of the material around HRG 2304 and its <b>off-center</b> <b>nucleus</b> in the direction of AM 1646 - 795 (NED 01) characterize HRG 2304 as a Solitaire-type galaxy candidate in an early stage of ring formation.

40|$|The {{nucleus of}} a galaxy orbits around the mass centroid. Orbital motions appear overstable in {{numerical}} experiments {{started with a}} galaxy's nucleus at rest atop its mass centroid. The amplitude doubles in 6 - 10 orbital periods. Orbits precess, nutate, and change their amplitudes, but they keep fairly constant periods. Orbital periods are in resonance with local particle motions, and amplitudes reach a core radius. This resonance suggests that center motions are a local, rather than a global, phenomenon. The overstability implies that a galaxy cannot be formed in nature with its nucleus at rest atop its mass centroid, and that nuclei orbit the mass centroid in real galaxies. These center motions should show up observationally as a shift of the nucleus away from the center defined by nearby isophotes. <b>Off-center</b> <b>nuclei</b> {{have been reported in}} many galaxies (e. g., M 33, M 101, NGC 3379, NGC 3384). Other kinds of observations confirmed the picture of nonsteady galactic centers as well. Gas trapped in moving nuclear regions of a galaxy should show strange flow patterns with possible shocks. The nuclear regions of galaxies including Milky Way and of globular clusters {{are not likely to be}} in a static steady state...|$|R
40|$|A {{perturber}} may excite {{a coherent}} mode in a star cluster or galaxy. If the stellar system is stable, {{it is commonly}} assumed that such a mode will be strongly damped and therefore of little practical consequence other than redistributing momentum and energy deposited by the perturber. This paper demonstrates that this assumption is false; weakly damped modes exist and may persist {{long enough to have}} observable consequences. To do this, a method for investigating the dispersion relation for spherical stellar systems and for locating weakly damped modes in particular is developed and applied to King models of varying concentration. This leads to a following remarkable result: King models exhibit very weakly damped m = 1 modes over a wide range of concentration (0. 67 {{less than or equal to}} c less than or equal to 1. 5 have been examined). The predicted damping time is tens of hundreds of crossing times. This mode causes the peak density to shift from and slowly revolve about the initial center. The existence of the mode is supported by n-body simulation. Higher order modes and possible astronomical consequences are discussed. Weakly damped modes, for example, may provide a neutral explanation for observed discrepancies between density and kinematic centers in galaxies, <b>off-center</b> <b>nuclei,</b> the location of velocity cusps due to massive black holes, and both m = 1 and barlike disturbances of disks enbedded in massive halos or spheroids. Gravitational shocking may excite the m = 1 mode in globular clusters, which could modify their subsequent evolution and displace the positions of exotic remnants...|$|R
40|$|We present new {{multi-band}} imaging data in {{the optical}} (BV RI and Hα) and near infrared bands (JHK) of 15 candidate ring galaxies from the sample of Appleton & Struck-Marcell (1987). We use these data to obtain color composite images, global magnitudes and colors of both the ring galaxy and its companion(s), and radial profiles of intensity and colors. We find that only nine of the observed galaxies have multi-band morphologies expected for the classical collisional scenario of ring formation, indicating {{the high degree of}} contamination of the ring galaxy sample by galaxies without a clear ring morphology. The radial intensity profiles, obtained by masking the <b>off-centered</b> <b>nucleus,</b> peak at the position of the ring, with the profiles in the continuum bands broader than that in the Hα line. The images as well as the radial intensity and color profiles clearly demonstrate the existence of the pre-collisional stellar disk outside the star-forming ring, which is in general bluer than the disk internal to the ring. The stellar disk seems to have retained its size, with the disk outside the ring having a shorter exponential scale length as compared to the values expected in normal spiral galaxies of comparable masses. The rings in our sample of galaxies are found to be located preferentially at around half-way through the stellar disk. The most likely reason for this preference is bias against detecting rings when they are close to the center (they would be confused with the resonant rings), and {{at the edge of the}} disk the gas surface density may be below the critical density required for star formation. Most of the observed characteristics point to relatively recent collisions (< 80 Myr ago) according to the N-body simulations of Gerber et al. (1996).
