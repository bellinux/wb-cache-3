However, in 2006, he altered his political stance, stating [...] "I was a Republican until they lost their minds." [...] At a July 2006 meeting of the Southern Regional Conference of the National School Boards Association in Destin, Florida, Barkley lent credence {{to the idea of}} running for Governor of Alabama, stating: I'm serious. I've got to get people to realize that the government is full of it. Republicans and Democrats want to argue over stuff that's not important, like gay marriage or the war in Iraq or illegal immigration... When I run— if I run— we're going to talk about real issues like improving our schools, cleaning up <b>our</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> of drugs and crime and making Alabama a better place for all people.|$|E

2500|$|Believing that {{successful}} community {{and economic development}} is built on a foundation of safety and security, Roxanne developed the Zero Tolerance Initiative: A Campaign to Take Back <b>Our</b> <b>Neighborhoods,</b> a comprehensive effort to combat blight and neighborhood deterioration. It was recognized by the US Conference of Mayors as a, [...] "Best Practice" [...] in 1999. She initiated Cincinnati's suit against gun manufacturers for failing to incorporate safety features into guns and for facilitating the illegal distribution of guns. She supported the hiring of more police officers and the Community Oriented Policing (COP) program that took police officers out of cars {{and put them on}} the street in neighborhoods. Also, she proposed the Permitting Drug Abuse ordinance to hold property owners responsible for knowingly permitting drug trafficking on their property.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, {{the city}} began a Neighborhood Initiatives program to [...] "insure that <b>our</b> <b>neighborhoods</b> are vibrant, livable areas since {{these are the}} {{portions}} of the city {{where most of the}} residents spend their time living, playing, shopping and going to school." [...] The purpose of this initiative is to foster vibrancy and redevelopment in the neighborhoods, and to restore the sense of neighborhood communities that had been overlooked in the city for some time. [...] The city began the program with street-scape and infrastructure improvements in the Rimmon Heights neighborhood of the West Side, which has spurred growth and investment in and by the community. [...] Despite the success of the program in Rimmon Heights, it was unclear in recent years how the city planned to implement similar programs throughout the city. The city announced plans for extending the Neighborhood Initiatives program to the Hollow neighborhood in February 2012.|$|E

60|$|To {{a person}} who takes {{a view of the}} whole, the {{strength}} of Paris, thus formed, will appear a system of general weakness. It is boasted that the geometrical policy has been adopted, that all local ideas should be sunk, and that the people should be no longer Gascons, Picards, Bretons, Normans,--but Frenchmen, with one country, one heart, and one Assembly. But, instead of being all Frenchmen, the greater likelihood is that the inhabitants of that region will shortly have no country. No man ever was attached by a sense of pride, partiality, or real affection, to a description of square measurement. He never will glory in belonging to the chequer No. 71, or to any other badge-ticket. We begin our public affections in our families. No cold relation is a zealous citizen. We pass on to <b>our</b> <b>neighborhoods,</b> and our habitual provincial connections. These are inns and resting-places. Such divisions of our country as have been formed by habit, and not by a sudden jerk of authority, were so many little images of the great country, in which the heart found something which it could fill. The love to the whole is not extinguished by this subordinate partiality. Perhaps it is a sort of elemental training to those higher and more large regards by which alone men come to be affected, as with their own concern, in the prosperity of a kingdom so extensive as that of France. In that general territory itself, as in the old name of Provinces, the citizens are interested from old prejudices and unreasoned habits, and not on account of the geometric properties of its figure. The power and preëminence of Paris does certainly press down and hold these republics together as long as it lasts: but, for the reasons I have already given you, I think it can not last very long.|$|E

The village of <b>Our</b> <b>Neighborhood</b> is a place invaded by three-fold pollution: contamination of the natural environment; destruction of the balance in local economy by the infiltration of industrial capital; and a growing trend toward mutual distrust among the villagers themselves. In the process, Lee articulates a sharp critique of the network of forces contributing to the material and spiritual destitution of rural communities.|$|R
