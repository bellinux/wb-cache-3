40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to compare {{visibility}} of the mandibular canal on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) -based <b>orthoradial</b> and oblique slices at molar implant sites. CBCT images for 132 mandibular molar implant sites were selected for the study. After generating <b>orthoradial</b> and oblique slices, two observers evaluated the visibility of the mandibular canal using three-point scoring scale (1 – 3, good to excellent). Wilcoxon signed-rank test compared the visibility scores of the two slices. Both <b>orthoradial</b> and oblique slices obtained from CBCT had only very good to excellent mandibular canal visibility scores. At 114 mandibular molar implant sites, the visibility score was equal on both <b>orthoradial</b> and oblique slices. Although the visibility score was higher on <b>orthoradial</b> slices for 12 implant sites, the visibility score was higher for six implant sites on oblique slices and the difference was not significant. Therefore, the visibility of the mandibular canal was excellent and comparable on most of <b>orthoradial</b> and oblique slices obtained from CBCT images...|$|E
40|$|AIM:To assess which slice {{inclination}} {{would be}} more accurate in measuring sites for implant placement: the oblique or the <b>orthoradial</b> slice. METHODS: Five regions of eight edentulous mandibles were selected (incisor, canine, premolar, first molar and second molar). The mandibles were scanned with a Next Generation i-CAT CBCT unit. Two previously calibrated oral radiologists performed vertical measurements in all the selected regions using both the oblique and <b>orthoradial</b> slices. The mandibles were sectioned in all the evaluated regions {{in order to obtain}} the gold standard. The Wilcoxon signed rank test compared the measurements obtained in the oblique and <b>orthoradial</b> slices with the gold standard. RESULTS:The bone height measurements for the first and second molar regions using the <b>orthoradial</b> slices were statistically different from the gold standard. CONCLUSIONS: Using the <b>orthoradial</b> slices to obtain cross-sectional images may offer insufficient accuracy for implant placement in the posterior region...|$|E

We compute the relevant physical quantities and argue that axisymmetry induces a large scale organization in turbulent flows. We show that there exists a low energy, low temperature regime, for which the <b>orthoradial</b> velocity field is organized into vertical stripes, {{as well as a}} high energy, infinite temperature regime where the typical <b>orthoradial</b> vorticity field gets organized into either a single vertical jet or a large scale dipole, and exhibits infinite fluctuations. The mechanisms yielding the large scale organizations are argued to be different from the ones involved in two dimensional (2 D) turbulence. This shows that the 3 D axisymmetric case is truly an intermediate case between 2 D and 3 D turbulence. Contents...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{detecting}} a collision target in ground clutter, using a long integration time. A single reception channel being available, classical space time adaptive processing (STAP) cannot be used. After range processing, ground clutter can be modeled as a known interference subspace in the Doppler domain depending on its radial and <b>orthoradial</b> speeds. We exploit this a priori knowledge to perform an adpative detection of a collision target supposed to lie in a known and different subspace. A GLRT detector is first derived for known clutter covariance matrix. Then, the unknown covariance matrix is adaptively estimated from the projection of the data onto the modeled clutter subspace, and is plugged in the GLRT to form a suboptimal detector. The proposed scheme {{can be viewed as a}} synthetic STAP, for which the space domain is replaced by a clutter <b>orthoradial</b> information and longer integration time...|$|E

Surprisingly, magnetization in the domains is <b>orthoradial</b> (azimuthal, vortex-like), a situation not anticipated by theory for long nanotubes. The material is therefore technologically appealing for a dense 3 D magnetic device {{such as the}} racetrack memory (based on shifting magnetic walls), as flux-closure domains should efficiently prevent cross-talk related to internal dipolar fields.

Theoretical analysis shows that experimental results can be interpreted as the manifestation of parametric amplification when the rf current is small, and of parametric instability when the rf current is above a certain threshold. By taking into account the energy nonlinearities, we succeed to describe the amplitude saturation of vortex oscillations as well as the coexistence of stable regimes...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of local {{order on the}} disordering scenario of small Wigner islands is discussed. A first disordering step is put in evidence by the time correlation functions and is linked to individual excitations resulting in configuration transitions, which {{are very sensitive to}} the local symmetries. This is followed by two other transitions, corresponding to <b>orthoradial</b> and radial diffusion, for which both individual and collective excitations play a significant role. Finally, we show that, contrary to large systems, the focus that is commonly made on collective excitations for such small systems through the Lindemann criterion has to be made carefully in order to clearly identify the relative contributions in the whole disordering process.

Intravenous contrast material is mainly used in cases of suspected jaw infection or in neoplastic diseases to assess the intraosseous and extraosseous involvement. Although CBCT has gained increasing popularity over the past years, it does not allow evaluation of extraosseous structures; use of CBCT may therefore lead to underestimation of disease extent.|$|E

These results are in agreement with micromagnetic simulations of the time decay response of the local magnetization to excitations with different azimuthal symmetries, (ˆ x + i ˆ y) e −iiφ. This demonstrates that the azimuthal-index is the discriminating parameter for the selection rules, as only = 0 modes are excited by the RF magnetic field, whereas only = + 1 modes are excited by the RF current, owing to the <b>orthoradial</b> symmetry of the induced RF Oersted field...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} a pre-stressed annular thin film {{subjected to a}} uniform displacement field along its inner boundary. This loading scenario leads to a variable stress distribution characterized by an <b>orthoradial</b> component that may change sign along a concentric circle within the annular domain. When {{the intensity of the}} applied field is strong enough, elastic buckling occurs circumferentially, leading to a localized wrinkling pattern near the inner edge. Using a linear non-homogeneous pre-bifurcation state, the eigenvalue problem describing this instability is cast as a singularly-perturbed fourth-order linear differential equation with variable coefficients. The dependence of the lowest eigenvalue on various non-dimensional quantities is numerically investigated using the compound matrix method. These results are complemented by a WKB analysis which suggests that the qualitative and quantitative features of the full model can be described by a simplified second-order eigenvalue problem which takes into account the finite stiffness of the system...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{specific}} process {{devoted to the}} biorientation of PVC pipes is studied. It consists of the simultaneous blowing and stretching of an extruded pan: The tensile and impact properties of these pipes are analysed and compared to the performances of an usual extruded pipe and a blown pipe (no stretching). The blowing significantly increases {{the properties of the}} pipes in the <b>orthoradial</b> theta-direction. In the longitudinal z-direction, the tensile properties remain almost unchanged. Nevertheless, when impact properties are considered, the monooriented PVC exhibits very weak performances. The biorientation induced by an additional stretching makes the properties in the z-direction increase without decreasing the theta performance. Impact properties are significantly increased compared both to extruded pipes and blown pipes. This improvement in the properties is related to an important modification of the microstructure. The molecules of the PVC are oriented and the material behaves like a laminate composed of a great number of bioriented (theta-z) layers.

The typical application is the transfer of a satellite from an orbit around the Earth to another one, both orbits being elliptic. We recall the standard model to represent the system.

In both cases, a preliminary analysis of singular and regular extremals is also given, using the usual concept of order to classify the contacts. Moreover, the singularity of the multi-input model [...] -which is a particular case of a subriemannian system with drift [...] -is resolved, and the related nilpotent model is given. Finally, second order optimality conditions are recalled, for smooth regular and singular extremals.

40|$|Surface current mapping from HF/VHF coastal radars {{traditionally}} requires {{at least}} two distant sites. Vector velocities are estimated by combining the radial velocity components measured by the radars. In many circumstances (e. g., failures, interferences, logistics constraints), such a combination is not possible by lack of data from one station. Two methods are evaluated to get information on surface circulation from a single site radar: the Vectorial Reconstruction Method (VRM) for current vector mapping and the Vortex Identification Method (VIM) for detecting eddy-like structures. The VRM assumes a non-divergent horizontal surface current, and the VIM analyzes radial velocities and their radial and <b>orthoradial</b> gradients. These two methods are tested on modeled and measured data sets in the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea where both high-resolution ocean circulation model and radar campaigns are available. The VRM performance is strongly limited by the divergence-free hypothesis which was not satisfied in our real data.

Material and Methods: Four hundred teeth were analyzed for the in vivo study. Digital radiographs were taken in an <b>orthoradial</b> direction from the mandibular incisor and canine regions. The digital radiographs of the canine region allowed visualizing the incisors in a distoradial direction using 20 degrees deviation. All individuals agreed to participate by signing an informed consent form. The in vitro study was conducted on 200 mandibular incisors positioned on a model, simulating the mandibular dental arch. Digital radiographs were taken from the mandibular incisors in both buccolingual and mesiodistal directions.

In the buccolingual direction, 17. 5 % of teeth evaluated in vivo and 15 % evaluated in vitro presented bifurcation or characteristics indicating bifurcation.

40|$|Moving Target Indicators (MTI) are {{airborne}} radar systems designed {{to detect and}} track moving vehicles or aircrafts. In this paper, we {{address the problem of}} detecting hazardous collision targets to avoid them. One of the best known solutions to solve this problem is given by the so-called Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) algorithms which optimally filter the target signal from interference and noise exploiting the specific relationship between Direction Of Arrival (DOA) and Doppler for the ground clutter. However, these algorithms require an antenna array and multiple reception channels that increase cost and complexity. The authors propose an alternative solution using a single antenna only. In addition to the standard Doppler shift related to the radial speed, the <b>orthoradial</b> speed of any target can be estimated if using a long integration time. Dangerous targets and ground clutter have different signatures in the radial-orthoradial velocity plane. An optimal detector is then proposed based on the oblique projection onto the signal subspace orthogonal to the clutter subspace. The theoretical performances of this detector are derived and a realistic radar scene simulation shows the benefits of this new MTI detector...|$|E

The main goal is to quantify the uncertainty propagation by comparing the maximal values of outputs of interest (<b>orthoradial</b> stress and Mazars equivalent strain) with the ones obtained from a deterministic calculation. The Young modulus is supposed to be accurately represented by a weakly homogeneous random field and realizations are provided through its – troncated – Karhunen-Loève expansion.

40|$|International audienceThis paper aims at {{determining}} {{thermomechanical stress}} variations induced by annealed copper filled through-silicon via (TSV) in single crystalline silicon using metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) rosette sensors. These eight branches sensors were specifically designed and {{embedded in a}} 65 -nm CMOS technology test vehicle. An in-house four-point bending tool was employed to calibrate and to extract the six independent piezoresistive coefficients. Through the piezoresistive relations, the stress tensor was evaluated by carrying out electrical measurements on wafer splits. A finite-element approach was also adopted to evaluate numerically the stresses and the expected mobility variations induced by TSV. According to this paper, a large variation of stresses (up to 100 MPa) in the sensor area was estimated, suggesting possible sensor design improvements to better accuracy. A good agreement was obtained between numerical and experimental results, except for the <b>orthoradial</b> component, which was found slightly compressive experimentally. Based on a critical analysis of the experimental-numerical methodology and results detailed in this paper, guidelines are drawn to get better accuracy through the improvement of MOS size and positions as well as recommendations regarding test strategy to overcome process variability. In the longer term, such improvements should lead {{to the definition of}} a comprehensive strategy for mechanical stress probing with in situ structures in advanced semiconductor products...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLES is used {{to study}} {{self-excited}} transverse modes in an atmospheric, square combustor (p = 1 bar). Simulations over a range of different mass flow rates show that transverse modes are present for all cases and exhibit varying RMS pressure amplitudes up to 0. 4 bar. Analysis of LES results shows that transverse modes are due to a lock-in mechanism between an hydrodynamic unstable mode typical of swirling flows (the PVC mode or Processing Vortex Core) and the cavity modes. A control method using damping compliant walls (named DCWs) is applied to control the acoustic mode in the LES and to characterize the PVC {{in the absence of}} acoustic forcing. This method shows that the highest pressure oscillations appear when the PVC frequency is close to the frequency of the first transverse acoustic mode. A 3 D Helmholtz solver is then used to predict the stability limits obtained by 3 D LES. To capture transverse modes, a new flame transfer function (FTF) formulation is derived where local heat release perturbations are controlled by the <b>orthoradial</b> acoustic velocity fluctuations. The FTF is measured in the LES and when it is included in the Helmholtz solver, it allows to recover the stability zones observed in the LES...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{ultrasonic}} tomography method for pipeline flow field imaging, {{based on the}} Zernike polynomial series. Having intrusive multipath time-offlight ultrasonic measurements (difference in flight time and speed of ultrasound) at the input, we provide at the output tomograms of the fluid velocity components (axial, radial, and <b>orthoradial</b> velocity). Principally, by representing these velocities as Zernike polynomial series, we reduce the tomography problem to an ill-posed problem of finding the coefficients of the series, relying on the acquired ultrasonic measurements. Thereupon, this problem is treated by applying and comparing Tikhonov regularization and quadratically constrained l 1 minimization. To enhance the comparative analysis, we additionally introduce sparsity, by employing SVD-based filtering in selecting Zernike polynomials which are {{to be included in}} the series. The first approach - Tikhonov regularisation without filtering, is used because it is the most suitable method. The performances are quantitatively tested by considering a residual norm and by estimating the flow using the axial velocity tomogram. Finally, the obtained results show the relative residual norm and the error in flow estimation, respectively, ~ 0. 3 % and ~ 1. 6 % for the less turbulent flow and ~ 0. 5 % and ~ 1. 8 % for the turbulent flow. Additionally, a qualitative validation is performed by proximate matching of the derived tomograms with a flow physical model...|$|E

The main goal is to quantify the uncertainty propagation by comparing the maximal values of outputs of interest (<b>orthoradial</b> stress and Mazars equivalent strain) for each realisation of the considered random field with the ones obtained from a reference calculation taking into account uniform field (equal to the expected value of the random field). The Young modulus is supposed to be accurately represented by a weakly homogeneous random field and realisations are provided through its truncated Karhunen–Loève expansion. This study reveals that the expected value for the maximal equivalent strain in the structure is more important when considering the Young modulus spatial variability than the value obtained from a deterministic approach with a uniform Young modulus field.

Methods : Thirty-two selected teeth from human dentate mandibles were radiographed in <b>orthoradial,</b> mesioradial and distoradial aspect using conventional film (Insight Kodak F-speed; Eastman Kodak, Rochester, NY) and a digital sensor (Trophy RVG advanced imaging system) with 0. 7 mm and 1. 0 mm deep cavities prepared on their vestibular, mesial and distal surfaces at the cervical, middle and apical thirds. Three dental professionals, an endodontist, a radiologist and a general practitioner, evaluated the images twice with a one-week time interval. Results : No statistical significance {{was seen in the}} first observation for both conventional and digital radiographic methods in the detection of simulated external root resorptions and for small and medium cavities but statistical difference was noted in the second observation (P< 0. 001) for both the methods.

40|$|International audienceUnder high in situ stresses, the {{excavation}} of underground openings generally causes {{the creation of}} a disturbed (EdZ: Excavation disturbed Zone) and/or damaged (EDZ: Excavation Damaged Zone) zone, resulting from the initiation and growth of cracks and fractures and from the pre-existing stress redistribution. The EdZ or EDZ changes the mechanical and hydromechanical properties which in return, constitute a potential risk for the performance of the geologic and/or engineered structures in the context of waste underground storage. Ultrasonic experiments have been implemented to characterize the EDZ extension around drifts and its evolution in time according to the structural support type (soft or rigid) and the environmental conditions. Those studies consist of two experimental components: (1) the prior auscultation of the floor and sidewalls of the gallery by ultrasonic transmission tomography, (2) the monitoring of the time-dependant evolution of EDZ and the analysis of measurable changes in the propagation of ultrasonic waves in the medium term. A code for computing these continuous in situ velocity measurements into the elastic has been developed. Then, the five dynamic elastic constants for the assumed transverse isotropic character of the rock are derived as a function of time and the distance from the drift wall. Performed a few months after {{the excavation}} of the galleries, the tomography shows that ultrasonic velocities are higher in the <b>orthoradial</b> direction (both in the concrete support and rock).

Aim: The goal {{of this study was to}} compare two image acquisition methods, intraoral radiographs and cone beam computed tomography (CBCT), in the diagnosis of external resorption. Material and Methods: Thirty-four maxillary and mandibular bicuspids were divided into three groups. Perforations measuring 0. 3 and 0. 6 mm in diameter and 0. 15 and 0. 3 mm in depth, respectively, were made on the lingual root surfaces in thirty teeth, and four were used as controls. Next, teeth were mounted on an apparatus and radiographed at mesial, distal, and <b>orthoradial</b> angulations. CBCT images were also taken. The analysis of the intraoral radiographic and tomographic images was carried out by two experts using standardized scores. Data were then compared statistically. Results: A strong agreement between the examiners was observed in both diagnosis methods, the intraoral radiographic (r = 0. 93) and the tomographic analysis (r = 1. 0). Tomography had higher statistically significant detection values than intraoral radiography (P < 0. 05). In intraoral radiographs, the detection was significantly greater (P < 0. 05) in the mandibular bicuspids, compared with their maxillary counterparts. The ability to detect 0. 6 -mm perforations by intraoral radiography was significantly higher than that of 0. 3 -mm perforations (P < 0. 05).

The study was carried out with 200 periapical radiographs of the whole mouth, which totaled 800 teeth. This methodology was selected due to the possibility of analyzing radiographs of canines, premolars and lower molars using different ranges of horizontal angles, which enabled the identification of overlapped roots in the <b>orthoradial</b> incidence.

Concerning the eruption level, 61 % were at the medium, 38 % at the apical and 1 % at the cervical 1 / 3 of the root. The most frequently affected tooth was the 1 st premolar, which comprised 70 % of the cases in comparison to 30 % cases affecting the 2 nd premolars.

Materials and methods : CBCT images were obtained in Galileos CBCT device after placement of gutta percha markers, three to the facial and one to the lingual of the area of interest in the mandible. The CBCT <b>orthoradial</b> image showing perfect alignment of the lingual with a facial marker was selected as the plane of measurement. The distance between the most superior and most inferior point on the bone on the selected plane was measured electronically. The specimens were sectioned along this plane and physical measurements were obtained with digital calipers. Linear distance was measured between the most superior and most inferior point on the bone on the selected plane. This distance was measured in 6 specimens with calipers and compared to the distance measured on the corresponding CBCT images. Results: A paired-sample t-test was used to determine whether the mean difference measurement value of two measurements at right side was significantly equal to zero. The data revealed that overall there was no statistically significant difference between CBCT and Physical measurement on right side (p= 0. 2298), left side (p= 0. 3554) and overall between CBCT and Physical measuremnets (p= 0. 2684).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{timeframe}} between tooth extraction and radiographically detectable socket cortication in humans. METHODS: Two {{hundred and fifty}} patients with a CT scan ≤ 36 months after tooth extraction were included. First, three <b>orthoradial</b> multiplanar reconstruction slices, representing the {{major part of the}} extraction socket, were scored regarding the degree of bone healing as (i) healed, that is, complete/continuous cortication of the socket entrance, or (ii) non-healed. Thereafter, {{based on the results of}} all three slices, the stage of cortication of the extraction socket, as one unit, was classified as (i) non-corticated, that is, all three slices judged as non-healed, (ii) partially corticated, that is, 1 or 2 slices judged as non-healed, or (iii) completely corticated, that is, all three slices judged as healed. The possible effect of several independent parameters, that is, age, gender, timeframe between tooth extraction and CT scan, tooth type, extent of radiographic bone loss of the extracted tooth, tooth-gap type, smoking status, presence of any systemic disease, and medication intake, on cortication status was statistically evaluated. RESULTS: Three to 6 months after tooth extraction, 27 % of the sockets were judged as non-corticated and 53 % were judged as partially corticated. After 9 - 12 months, > 80 % of the sockets were corticated, while some incompletely corticated sockets were detected up to 15 months after extraction. Each additional month after tooth extraction contributed significantly to a higher likelihood of a more advanced stage of cortication, while radiographic bone loss ≥ 75 % significantly prolonged cortication time; no other independent variable had a significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate a considerably long timeframe until complete cortication of an extraction socket, that is, 3 - 6 months after tooth extraction 3 of 4 sockets were still not completely corticated, and only after 9 - 12 months, complete cortication was observed in about 80 % of the sockets...|$|E
40|$|General-relativistic {{deflection}} {{of light}} by mass, dipole, and quadrupole {{moments of the}} gravitational field of a moving massive planet {{in the solar system}} is derived in the approximation of the linearized Einstein equations. All terms of order 1 µas are taken into account, parametrized, and classified in accordance with their physical origin. The monopolar light-ray deflection, modulated by the radial Doppler effect, is associated with the total mass and radial velocity of the gravitating body. It displaces the apparent positions of stars in the sky plane radially away from the origin of the celestial coordinates associated with the planet. The dipolar deflection of light is due to a translational mismatch of the center of mass of the planet and the origin of the planetary coordinates caused by the inaccuracy of planetary ephemeris. It can also originate from the difference between the null cone for light and that for gravity that is not allowed in general relativity but can exist in some of the alternative theories of gravity. The dipolar gravity field pulls the apparent position of a star in the plane of the sky in both radial and <b>orthoradial</b> directions with respect to the origin of the coordinates. The quadrupolar deflection of light is caused by the physical oblateness, J 2, of the planet, but in any practical experiment it will have an admixture of the translation-dependent quadrupole due to inaccuracy of planetary ephemeris. This leads to a bias in the estimated value of J 2 that should be minimized by applying an iterative data reduction method designed to disentangle the different multipole moments and to fit out the translation-dependent dipolar and quadrupolar components of light deflection. The method of microarcsecond interferometric astrometry has the potential of greatly improving the planetary ephemerides, getting unbiased measurements of planetary quadrupoles, and of thoroughly testing the null-cone structure of the gravitational field and the speed of its propagation in the near-zone of the solar system. We calculate the instantaneous patterns of the light-ray deflections caused by the monopole, the dipole, and the quadrupole moments, and derive equations describing apparent motion of the deflected position of the star in the sky plane as the impact parameter of the light ray with respect to the planet changes due to its orbital motion. We discuss the observational capabilities of the near-future optical (SIM) and radio (SKA) interferometers for detecting the Doppler modulation of the radial deflection, and the dipolar and quadrupolar light-ray bendings by Jupiter and Saturn...|$|E

Recent reports have indicated increased primary implant stability and reduced bone strain after immediate implant loading {{in the presence of}} a (thick) cortical layer, thus, knowledge of the timeframe between tooth extraction and hard-tissue bridging of the extraction socket appears clinically relevant in some situations. Aim/Hypothesis To determine the timeframe between tooth extraction and radiographically detectable corticalization of the socket in humans and to evaluate the possible impact of various factors on this process, e. g., history of periodontitis, smoking status, systemic disease, medications, etc. Material and Methods Two-hundred-fifty patients with a CT scan μ 8804, 36 months after tooth extraction and without any manipulation at the extraction site were included. Three <b>orthoradial</b> multiplanar reconstruction slices per extraction socket were scored, by a single calibrated examiner, regarding the degree of corticalization as: (a) healed, i. e., complete/continuous corticalization of the socket entrance, or (b) non-healed. Thereafter, each extraction socket was classified as (1) non-corticalized, i. e., all 3 slices classified as non-healed, (2) partially corticalized, i. e., 1 or 2 slices classified as non-healed, or (3) corticalized, i. e., all 3 slices classified as healed (Figure 1). The possible effect of several independent parameters, i. e., age, gender, timeframe between tooth extraction and CT scan, tooth type, periodontal status, gap dimension, smoking status, presence of any systemic disease, and medication intake, on the corticalization status was statistically evaluated. Results Three to 6 months after tooth extraction, 27 % of the sockets were judged as non-corticalized, and 53 % were judged as partially corticalized. After 9 to 12 months, > 80 % of the sockets were corticalized, but some non-corticalized sockets were detected up to 15 months post-extraction (Figure 2). Each additional month after tooth extraction contributed significantly to higher likelihood of a corticalized socket (OR 1. 645, 95 % CIs 1. 471 – 1. 841, P < 0. 001). Periodontal attachment loss of μ 8805, 75 % significantly prolonged corticalization time, i. e., teeth with < 75 % attachment loss were judged more often as corticalized (OR 1. 984, 95 % CIs 1. 011 – 3. 896, P = 0. 047). No other independent variable had a significant effect on corticalization status. Conclusions and Clinical Implications Three to 6 months after tooth extraction one out of 4 sockets was still completely non corticalized, and only 9 to 12 months after tooth extraction complete corticalization was observed in about 80 % of the sockets. The results, indicating a considerably long timeframe until corticalization of extraction sockets, imply that in cases where immediate loading requiring high primary implant stability is considered, waiting μ 8805, 9 months post-extraction appears advisable...|$|E
40|$|Background Maxillary sinus floor {{augmentation}} (MSFA) with autologous bone and/or bone substitutes is {{a reliable}} procedure {{to develop an}} implant site. Loss of augmentation volume during the healing period seems {{to be dependent on}} the type of graft material and possibly on the sinus dimensions/morphology, e. g. a larger distance between the buccal and palatal sinus wall (i. e. “wide” sinus) might delay graft consolidation due to a longer distance angiogenic/osteogenic factors and cells need to cover to populate the graft. Aim/Hypothesis To assess the bucco-palatal width of the maxillary sinus in the premolar and molar region and any possible differences due to tooth region, gender, tooth-gap extent, and residual alveolar bone dimensions. Further, to attempt a rational, simple sinus classification based on its bucco-palatal width. Material and Methods CTs of the posterior maxilla were divided depending on tooth-gap extent into (a) edentulous, and (b) 1 - or 2 -tooth gap. Sites presenting on the CT > 5 mm of the maxillary sinus, no previous augmentation procedures and/or oro-antral communication were included. A central <b>orthoradial</b> multiplanar reconstruction slice from each edentulous tooth site was chosen by a calibrated examiner to record the following parameters: (i) alveolar bone height (ABH), (ii) alveolar bone area (ABA), (iii) alveolar bone width (ABW) 2 mm apical to the alveolar crest (ABW 2), (iv) ABW at the sinus floor (ABWS), (v) bucco-palatal sinus width (SW) and (vi) sinus area (SA) at a level 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 mm above the sinus floor (SW 2 /SA 2, SW 4 /SA 4, etc.) (Figure 1). Based on mean values (i. e. 75 th percentile and 67 th percentile) the sinus was classified as narrow, average, and wide, respectively, to attempt a simple sinus classification. Results Eighty-six partially dentate and 76 edentulous quadrants contributed with 383 tooth sites (58 first and 97 second premolars, 129 first and 99 second molars). Alveolar bone and sinus parameters did not differ depending on tooth-gap extent and gender, but differed significantly depending on tooth site, i. e. ABH and ABA was smallest at the first molar, and ABW, ABWS, SW, and SA were significantly larger at the molars. Further, ABW correlated significantly with SW and SA. High variability in SW among the various levels within the same tooth site, as well as high variability among tooth sites within the same person was observed, i. e. in > 50 % of the cases, sinus classification (i. e., narrow, average, or wide) varied depending on SW height level (Table 1) and among tooth sites within each patient. Conclusions and Clinical Implications Maxillary sinus bucco-palatal width varies significantly among the various height levels within the same tooth site and among tooth sites within the same person. A rational, simple classification of each sinus as narrow, average, or wide was not applicable...|$|E
40|$|The goal {{of atomic}} physics parity {{violation}} (PV) experiments is {{to test the}} "Standard Model" of particles and interactions. Weak interactions are known to violate parity and the exchange of Z° bosons between nucleons and electrons {{gives rise to a}} very small parity mixing between the S and P states of an isolated atom. For this reason, forbidden transitions have been chosen for atomic physics measurements of parity violation [1]. The electric dipole transition moment is measured by interference of the corresponding amplitude, either with the magnetic dipole amplitude, as in the measurements in Tl, Pb or Bi, or with a Stark induced electric dipole transition amplitude as in the Cs experiments in Paris [2], or in Boulder [3], both using a CW excitation of the 6 S- 7 S transition. Beyond an independent determination of the Cs 133 anapole moment, increasing the accuracy of the PV measurements is crucial in identifying possible additional vector bosons Z°', since they might escape high-energy experiments. Today Cs still represents the best compromise between the enhancement of the PV effects in heavy atoms (Z-cube law [1]), a calculable atomic structure, and feasibility of the experiments. While the previous experiments on the Cs 6 S- 7 S transition have been using fluorescence detection, the new scheme implemented at ENS uses a pump-probe detection method. A pulsed laser beam of linear polarisation excites the atoms on the 6 S- 7 S transition in a longitudinal electric field. The collinear probe beam, of linear polarisation, tuned to the transition 7 S- 6 P 3 / 2 is amplified. Parity violation results in a dependence of the probe gain on the handedness of the trihedron (E field, excitation polarization, probe polarization). The asymmetry is of the order of 10 ^- 6 for a typical E field of 1. 7 kV/cm and is odd in the E field reversal. The resulting change in the probe polarisation is detected by balanced mode polarimetry. In the ideal experiment where the probe and excitation polarization are parallel at cell entrance, the PV asymmetry is measured at each shot. Lineshape-independent calibration of the measured PV signals is obtained by a controlled rotation of the excitation polarisation. This calibration procedure remains valid even if the probe gain is high, in which case the PV asymmetry can be amplified. Due to the order of magnitude of the asymmetry (and the final goal of a 1 % precision on the PV measurement), a thorough study of all the error sources has to be conducted, even if one major source of systematics, the interference of the magnetic amplitude with the Stark induced amplitude, is absent due to the longitudinal field configuration. This contribution will detail the present status of this experiment, of the identification and reduction of the systematic errors, as well as reduction of the different noise sources. 1) Probe polarisation measurement. The use of two-channel (balanced-mode) polarimetry allows us to reject the fluctuations associated with pulsed lasers, and reach the shot noise limit on individual probe polarization measurements. The change in the polarisation signal associated with the 6 S- 7 S excitation pulse is extracted by subtracting the polarimeter imbalance measured without excitation pulse. Spurious signals related to the geometry of the (amplified) probe beam, or to electromagnetic interference, are rejected using a half-wave plate inserted and removed in front of the analyser. Under such conditions the zero of the rotation of the probe polarisation acquires a real physical meaning to better than 1 micro-radian. 2) Linear dichroism vs optical rotation. One has to discriminate the expected probe linear dichroism against the optical rotation due to stray birefringences or Faraday effect. For this we use a half-wave plate inserted/removed before the atomic medium, to switch the probe polarization by 90 °. Birefringences on the excitation and probe beam paths are compensated separately. 3) Rotational symmetry around the beam axis [...] Additional insertable half-wave plates have been implemented to rotate the polarisations by 45 ° steps. The behaviour of the data under these rotations helps to identify the presence of transverse E and B fields in the vapour. 4) Stray fields observed in the glass vapour cells. More generally, a study of the magnetooptical effects in the vapour has been completed and gives access to all the components of stray E and B fields, together with their odd and even parts. A major contribution to transverse E fields has been associated to the presence of Cs ions due to photoionisation of Cs dimers. Transverse magnetic fields have been shown to originate from conduction currents flowing along the cesiated inner wall of the glass vapour cells. 5) Improvements obtained with sapphire/alumina cells. The use of sapphire cells allowed us to overheat the cesium vapour and obtain a considerable reduction of the dimer content and of the stray fields associated with dimer photoionization. Sapphire has been chosen because a preliminary study showed a very small surface conduction in the presence of Cs vapour. This allowed us to operate with sapphire cells without internal electrodes, much easier to fabricate and handle than the previous glass cells, and to benefit from the corresponding drop in the surface conduction currents. Sapphire windows proved to be highly resistant, while those of the glass cells were rapidly damaged by the electronic/ionic bombardment. Highly parallel sapphire windows were used to prevent reflection at each window by choosing the temperature for which the interference is destructive. Thus the energy available in the vapour is maximum, and the problems linked to the beam reflected at the output window are avoided. Radial E fields and <b>orthoradial</b> B fields were detected in the sapphire cells, indicating the presence of an electron charge flowing along the axis of the cell. This can be understood as due to electron emission from the window at the negative potential, followed by amplification of the charge by secondary emission due to collisions at grazing incidence on the inner wall of the cell. To prevent the grazing incidence collisions, a cell was made with grooves on the inner wall of the cell body. This proved to be efficient in reducing the stray fields. The current sensitivity of the PV measurement and prospects of the experiment is presented. REFERENCES [1] M. -A. Bouchiat & C. Bouchiat, "Parity violation in atoms", Rep. Prog.
