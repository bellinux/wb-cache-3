A 2 KW Nd-YAG laser system was used to harden the surface of alloy steel with various process parameters (laser power, focal spot diameter and beam velocity). The results (microhardness, microstructure change and residual stress distribution) were measured and analyzed with Vickers microhardness tester, optical/electron microscope and hole-drilling residual stress equipment. Statistical analyses of the experimental data were used for explaining the relationships between process parameters, microhardness and microstructure. General thermal hardening was applied in the research to show the influence of heating temperature and cooling method on microstructure and mechanical properties. Also, the results were compared with laser {{surface hardening}} process from microhardness, microstructure and residual stress to show the advantage of laser surface hardening.

50|$|With the {{introduction}} of the blast furnace to Europe in the Middle Ages, pig iron was able to be produced in much higher volumes than wrought iron. Because pig iron could be melted, people began to develop processes of reducing the carbon in the liquid pig iron to create steel. Puddling was introduced during the 1700s, where molten pig iron was stirred while exposed to the air, to remove the carbon by oxidation. In 1858, Sir Henry Bessemer developed a process of steel-making by blowing hot air through liquid pig iron to reduce the carbon content. The Bessemer process was able to produce the first large scale manufacture of steel. Once the Bessemer process began to gain widespread use, <b>other</b> <b>alloys</b> of <b>steel</b> began to follow.

5|$|Iron metal {{has been}} used since ancient times, {{although}} copper alloys, which have lower melting temperatures, were used even earlier in human history. Pure iron is relatively soft, but is unobtainable by smelting because it is significantly hardened and strengthened by impurities, in particular carbon, from the smelting process. A certain proportion of carbon (between 0.002% and 2.1%) produces steel, which may be up to 1000times harder than pure iron. Crude iron metal is produced in blast furnaces, where ore is reduced by coke to pig iron, which has a high carbon content. Further refinement with oxygen reduces the carbon content to the correct proportion to make steel. <b>Steels</b> and iron <b>alloys</b> formed with <b>other</b> metals (<b>alloy</b> <b>steels)</b> {{are by far the}} most common industrial metals because they have a great range of desirable properties and iron-bearing rock is abundant.|$|R

40|$|It {{is common}} that energy {{absorbing}} structural elements {{are subjected to}} a number of loading cycles before a crash event. Several studies have shown that previous fatigue can significantly influence the tensile properties of some materials, and hence the behaviour of structural elements made of them.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the principal features of the recently developed model for the short and the long-term marine corrosion of steels. In marine environments such as immersion, tidal and coastal atmospheric, chlorides conventionally are considered {{to play a major role}} in causing corrosion loss. It is shown that the actual corrosion process is considerably more complex and that besides oxidation by dissolved or atmospheric oxygen there is an important influence from the metabolic products of sulphate-reducing bacteria. The model also deals with temperature, oxygen availability, pollution and various other influences. Although the fundamental corrosion processes are all electrochemical in nature, the model does not deal specifically with these. Instead the model is built around the governing corrosion-rate controlling processes. For engineering purposes the rate of loss of material is the critical issue. The main emphasis is on the behaviour of structural and <b>other</b> low <b>alloy</b> <b>steels.</b> The paper closes with some observations about the applicability of the model to stainless and weathering steels and its recent extension to reinforcement corrosion in concrete structures and about current research directions...|$|R

Furthermore, this multi-layer adhered allows initially the built-up edge (BUE) development close {{to the edge of the}} tool by a mechanical adhesion mechanism.
