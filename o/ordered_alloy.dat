40|$|Abstract: The small {{hysteresis}} in the martensitic {{transformations of}} shape memory alloys permits to determine experimentally differences in enthalpy and entropy {{to a high}} degree of precision. Due to the diffusionless nature of rhe martensitic transformation the configurarional entropy remains invariant and the entropy difference results mainly from differences in the phonon spectra, which are accessible to experiment, especially the soft branches. From measured enthalpy differences in the long range <b>ordered</b> <b>alloys,</b> those conesponding to the disordered state can be deduced which, together with the vibrational entropy differences, provide also valuable information on the equilibrium phases. Close packed martensites with different stacking sequences are commonly observed, and from the critical transformation stresses their relative stability can be assessed.

40|$|Using 100 keV H+ ions, medium energy ion {{scattering}} (MEIS) {{has been}} applied to a study of Sb overlayers on Cu(111). Upon deposition of 10 ML of Sb at room temperature, considerable intermixing of Sb and Cu occurs in thick (100 Å) overlayers, forming a partially <b>ordered</b> <b>alloy</b> phase, of composition Cu 3 Sb. Heating to 200 °C produces a second <b>ordered</b> <b>alloy</b> phase with reduced Sb content, whilst heating to 305 °C diffuses excess Sb into the bulk and produces an ordered Cu(111) R 30 °Sb surface phase with 0. 33 ML Sb.

40|$|Recently, high {{magnetic}} anisotropy materials have received {{much attention to}} meet the demands of applications in the field of information technologies (Magnetic Films: Anisotropy). For example, in magnetic recording, as the bit size is reduced to nano dimension, material with high Ku value is needed to stabilize spin state against thermal agitation. Other applications of such materials are permanent magnet or bias layer for spin electronic devices. Among various hard magnetic materials, the equiatomic FePt <b>ordered</b> <b>alloy</b> has merged as a potential candidate for hard-disk drives with ultrahigh recording density because it has extremely high-magnetic-anisotropy energy, Ku (108 erg/cc). This high {{magnetic anisotropy}} energy allows for thermally stable grain size down to 3 nm. Thus, the FePt <b>ordered</b> <b>alloy</b> may lead to the realization of a magnetic medium capable of recording densities beyond 1 Tb in− 2 (Weller et al. 2000). In addition, due to the high Pt content, FePt alloy exhibits a very good corrosive and wear resistance. Nevertheless, a disadvantage of this material for practical applications is the relative high cost of Pt. Moreover, high temperature treatment is needed to obtain FePt films with high magnetic anisotropy. Consequently, there is now a search for methods to reduce the required temperatures. This article will briefly describe different methods which have been proposed for controlling the growth of FePt thin films, reducing the temperatures of treatment as well as tailoring the properties of FePt thin films for a desired application...|$|E
