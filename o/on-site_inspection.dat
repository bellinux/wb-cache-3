25|$|Lieutenant General Leonard Wood, Military Governor of Cuba, {{asked for}} {{the wreck of the}} Maine to be removed on October 1900. Secretary of the Navy John Davis Long {{approved}} the plan. A call for proposals was made on November 19, and five bids were received. Chamberlain & Co., of Chicago, Illinois, agreed to remove the wreck using balloons, hydraulic jacks, and compressed air for nothing in return for 97 percent of the profits on all sales of relics from the wreck (the government would receive the remainder). After an <b>on-site</b> <b>inspection,</b> Chamberlain claimed the ship was in one piece. But by April, when the time period for work to begin expired, no construction bond had been posted and no work was done. Chamberlain & Co. defaulted on their contract in July.|$|E
500|$|In 1958, Kistiakowsky {{suggested}} to President Eisenhower that inspection of foreign military facilities {{was not sufficient}} to control their nuclear weapons. He cited the difficulty in monitoring missile submarines, and proposed that the arms control strategy focus on disarmament rather than inspections. In January 1960, as part of arms control planning and negotiation, he suggested the [...] "threshold concept". Under this proposal, all nuclear tests above the level of seismic detection technology would be forbidden. After such an agreement, the US and USSR would work jointly to improve detection technology, revising the permissible test yield downward as techniques improved. This example of the [...] "national means of technical verification", a euphemism for sensitive intelligence collection used in arms control, would provide safeguards, without raising the <b>on-site</b> <b>inspection</b> requirement to a level unacceptable to the Soviets. The US introduced the threshold concept to the Soviets at the Geneva arms control conference in January 1960 and the Soviets, in March, responded favorably, suggesting a threshold of a given seismic magnitude. Talks broke down {{as a result of}} the U-2 Crisis of 1960 in May.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{fewer than}} half of the overall {{citations}} against Sago Mine in 2005 were for [...] "significant and substantial" [...] violations—and all but eight of the overall citations have been corrected by the operator. The eight remaining issues were being abated by the operator in compliance with the abatement provisions of the Mine Act. [...] "Mining operations at the Sago Mine more than doubled between 2004 and 2005, and the injury rate was significantly above the national average. This prompted MSHA to dramatically increase—by 84%—its <b>on-site</b> <b>inspection</b> and enforcement presence. As a result, MSHA also took significantly more enforcement actions—208 in total—against Sago Mine in 2005, requiring the operator to quickly correct health and safety violations in accordance with federal Mine Act standards." [...] Davitt McAteer, MSHA chief during the Clinton administration told The Gazette, [...] "The numbers don’t sound good.... sufficiently high that it should tip off management that there is something amiss here. For a small operation, that is a significant number of violations." [...] McAteer said the roof fall frequency [...] "suggests that the roof is bad and that the support system is not meeting the needs of the roof." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{verification}} {{regime of}} the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) {{has now been}} in operation {{for more than five}} years. Its two principal components are the declarations to be made by States Parties and the <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections</b> carried out by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) inspectors to verify these declarations. Its implementation {{has proved to be a}} resounding success—more than 1200 <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections</b> have been carried out in over 50 of the Convention’s 145 States Parties and many practical lessons have been learned. To ensure the continued success of the verification regime, some problems—particularly in relation to industry declarations, the updating of the approved list of <b>inspection</b> equipment, <b>on-site</b> sampling and analysis, and off-site analysis—need to be resolved...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Dr. Ernest Codman of Massachusetts General Hospital {{suggested}} {{a measure that}} tracked each patient of the hospital to determine effectiveness of their treatment. His proposal of a system to track patient care to determine quality and standard of hospital care dubbed {{him one of the}} earliest advocates of healthcare quality. [...] Shortly after, influenced by the work of Dr. Codman, the American College of Surgeons (ACS) was founded. In 1918, the ACS developed the Minimum Standard for Hospitals, which was one page. As a result of the 1918 Minimum Standard for Hospitals, ACS began performing <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections</b> of hospitals to determine if they were up to par. During the first <b>on-site</b> <b>inspections</b> of 692 hospitals, only 13% met the minimum standard.|$|R
