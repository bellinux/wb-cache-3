25|$|Mayonnaise {{can be made}} by {{hand with}} a whisk, or fork, or with the aid of an {{electric}} mixer <b>or</b> <b>blender.</b> It is made by slowly adding oil to an egg yolk, while whisking vigorously to disperse the oil. The oil and the water in the yolk form a base of the emulsion, while lecithin and protein from the yolk is the emulsifier that stabilizes it. A combination of van der Waals interactions and electrostatic repulsion determine the bond strength among oil droplets. The high viscosity of mayonnaise is attributed to the total strength created by these two intermolecular forces. Addition of mustard contributes to the taste and further stabilizes the emulsion, as mustard contains small amounts of lecithin. If vinegar is added directly to the yolk, it can emulsify more oil, thus making more mayonnaise.|$|E

50|$|Garlic is crushed in {{a mortar}} and pestle and {{emulsified}} with egg yolks, salt, and olive oil. Today, aioli is often made in a food processor <b>or</b> <b>blender,</b> but traditionalists object that this does not give the same result.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, primitive-, script-based {{modeling}} {{is not always}} a practical method to create objects such as realistic characters or complex man-made artifacts like cars. Those objects have to be created in mesh-based modeling applications such as Wings 3D <b>or</b> <b>Blender</b> and then converted to POV-Ray's own mesh format.|$|E

Meshes can be {{selected from a}} set of primitives (cube, ellipsoid, cone, etc.) or imported from third party software such as Maya <b>or</b> <b>Blender.</b> Physics are simulated with the Vortex engine. Users can specify separate collision and graphical meshes for a rigid body, greatly reducing simulation time. In addition, material properties and the interaction between materials can be specified, allowing different restitution, coefficient of friction, etc. within the simulation.|$|E
50|$|Emulsified {{sausages}} {{are cooked}} sausages {{with a very}} fine texture, using the combination of pork, beef, or poultry with fat, salt, cure, flavorings, and water. These ingredients are emulsified at high speed {{in a food processor}} <b>or</b> <b>blender.</b> During this process, the salt dissolves the muscle proteins, which helps to suspend the fat molecules. Temperature {{is an important part of}} the process: if the temperature rises above 60°F (16°C) for pork or 70°F (21°C) for beef, the emulsion will not hold and fat will leak from the sausage during the cooking process.|$|E
50|$|LDraw is {{a system}} of free {{software}} tools for modeling Lego creations in 3D on a computer. The LDraw file format and original program were written by James Jessiman, although the file format has since evolved. He also modeled many of the original parts in the parts library, which is under continuous maintenance and extension by the LDraw community. Following Jessiman's death in 1997, a variety of programs have been written that use the LDraw parts library, and file format. LDraw models are frequently rendered in POV-Ray <b>or</b> <b>Blender,</b> free 3D ray tracers.|$|E
50|$|Preparation of heugimja-juk {{starts with}} washing, soaking, and {{draining}} black sesame and rice separately.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to or instead of fenugreek other spices {{may be used}} such as mustard seeds, chili peppers, cumin, coriander, ginger, etc. [...] Sugar may be added to make them sweet instead of savory. Idli may also be stuffed with a filling of potato, beans, carrot and masala. Leftover idlis can be cut-up or crushed and sautéed for a dish called idli upma. [...] You can even prepare dahi idli by combining curd and idli together and then tempering the dish. Rather than a stovetop steamer, microwave and automatic electric idli steamers are available with convenient non-stick coating. Batter preparation using a manual rocking rock grinder can be replaced by electric grinders <b>or</b> <b>blenders</b> (mixies). Many restaurants have also come up with fusion recipes of Idlis as idly manchurian, idly fry, chilly idly {{and a lot of}} different ideas.|$|R

50|$|A BZFlag server can be {{configured}} {{to create}} a basic, random map for play, or users can load custom map files. BZFlag uses a customized text based map format to define the placement of objects. While writing a map is fairly simple in this format, most map-makers use a 3d modeling program Wings 3D, <b>or</b> <b>blender.</b> Graphical map editors, BZEdit or iBZEdit have also been used. Note that BZEdit is not distributed with the game, {{and is no longer}} under active development (versions of it are available at the BZFlag SourceForge.net site). However, using blender in combination with a BZFlag map plug-in is currently the most popular mapping method.|$|E
50|$|Rendering {{converts}} a model into {{an image}} either by simulating light transport to get photo-realistic images, or by applying an art style as in non-photorealistic rendering. The two basic operations in realistic rendering are transport (how much light gets {{from one place}} to another) and scattering (how surfaces interact with light). This step is usually performed using 3D computer graphics software or a 3D graphics API. Altering the scene into a suitable form for rendering also involves 3D projection, which displays a three-dimensional image in two dimensions. Although 3D modeling and CAD software may perform 3D rendering as well (e.g. Autodesk 3ds Max <b>or</b> <b>Blender),</b> exclusive 3D rendering software also exists.|$|E
50|$|Kue satu or kue koya {{is one of}} the {{simplest}} and easiest kue kering (traditional cookie) in Indonesian cuisine. It employed only four ingredients; mung beans, powdered sugar, vanilla essence, and water. The mung beans are being sautéed without oil until its green skin are cracked. Peeled and remove the skin, and mashed or ground the mung beans manually using mortar and pestle, or using electrical food processor <b>or</b> <b>blender.</b> The powdered mung beans is then mixed with powdered sugar, vanilla essence, and small amount of water to create the dough. The dough then placed into small cookie molds and then bake them in the oven of 150 degree Celsius heat. Then the baked cookies are aired and sun-dried for several hours before place them in air-tight glass or plastic cookie jar.|$|E
5000|$|The Sperry & Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co. (S&H) {{was in the}} {{business}} of issuing and [...] "redeeming" [...] S&H trading stamps. As explained in the Court’s opinion, trading stamps are a form of “scrip.” They can be used to purchase goods but only at a designated “store.” S&H sold the stamps to merchants, such as supermarket chains, which then “gave” the stamps to their customers, typically at the rate of one stamp for each ten cents' worth of purchases. The customers were instructed to paste the S&H stamps into booklets, and when they had accumulated enough booklets full of S&H stamps they could “redeem” them at an S&H redemption center for “gifts”—merchandise, such as golf clubs <b>or</b> <b>blenders.</b> S&H accounted for 40% of the US trading stamp business and more than 60% of US consumers saved S&H stamps; the industry annually issued 400 billion stamps to more than 200,000 stores, and they were distributed to the public in connection with retail sales of $40 billion.|$|R

50|$|A polygon soup is a {{group of}} unorganized triangles, with {{generally}} no relationship whatsoever. Polygon soups are a geometry storage format in a 3D modeling package, such as Maya, Houdini, <b>or</b> <b>Blender.</b> Polygon soup can help save memory, load/write time, and disk space for large polygon meshes compared to the equivalent polygon mesh. The larger the polygon soup, the larger the savings. For instance, fluid simulations, particle simulations, rigid-body simulations, environments, and character models can reach into the millions of polygon for feature films, causing large disk space and read/write overhead. As soon as any kind of hierarchical sorting or clustering scheme is applied, the polygon soup mesh becomes something else (one example being an octree, a subdivided cube). Any kind of polygonal geometry that hasn't been grouped in any way can be considered polygon soup. Optimized meshes may contain grouped items to make drawing faster.|$|E
50|$|The use of 3-d models greatly {{assists in}} the {{construction}} of paper models, with video game models being the most prevalent source. The video game or source in question will have to be loaded into the computer. Various methods of extracting the model exist, including using a model viewer and exporting it into a workable file type, or capturing the model from the emulation directly. The methods of capturing the model is often unique to the subject and the tools available. Readability of file formats including propriety ones could mean that a model viewer and exporter is unavailable outside of the developer. Using other tools that capture rendered 3-d models and textures are often the only way to obtain them. In this case, the designer may have to arrange the textures and the wire frame model on a 3D program, such as 3DS MAX, Metasequoia, <b>or</b> <b>Blender</b> before exporting it to a papercraft creating program, such as Dunreeb Cutout or Pepakura Designer by Tama software. From there the model is typically refined to give a proper layout and construction tabs that will affect the overall appearance and difficulty in constructing the model.|$|E
