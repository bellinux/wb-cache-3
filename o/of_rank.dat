5|$|Aspects of Scouting {{practice}} {{have been}} criticized as too militaristic.

5|$|Further {{advancement}} <b>of</b> <b>rank</b> was facilitated with Conroy's {{marriage to}} Elizabeth Fisher on 26 December 1808 in Dublin, {{though not as}} far as Conroy felt he deserved. Elizabeth {{was the daughter of}} Colonel (later Major-General) Benjamin Fisher and Conroy served under him in Ireland and England while performing various administrative duties. Conroy was promoted to Second Captain on 13 March 1811 and appointed adjutant in the Corps of Artillery Drivers on 11 March 1817.|$|E
50|$|Peter's {{distrust}} of the elitist and anti-reformist Boyars culminated in 1722 {{with the creation of}} the Table <b>of</b> <b>Ranks</b> (Табель о рангах; Tabel' o rangakh), a formal list <b>of</b> <b>ranks</b> in the Russian military, government, and royal court. The Table <b>of</b> <b>Ranks</b> established a complex system of titles and honorifics, each classed with a number (I to XIV) denoting a specific level of service or loyalty to the Tsar. The origins of the Table <b>of</b> <b>Ranks</b> lie in Russia's military ranking system, which was also significantly modified and revised under Peter's rule.|$|R

This form <b>of</b> <b>ranking</b> problem arises naturally in a variety of applications and, formally, constitutes a generalization <b>of</b> the bipartite <b>ranking</b> problem that has recently been studied. We start by defining notions <b>of</b> <b>ranking</b> error suitable for measuring the quality <b>of</b> a <b>ranking</b> function in the k-partite setting.

5|$|The {{first of}} the Navy uniforms were made in dark blue, but with the Southern style <b>of</b> <b>rank</b> {{insignia}} for the officers. The 1862 Confederate regulations ordered the uniform to be steel gray and lined with a dark black silk serge. They were also made in medium gray and cadet gray. They were made of wool, and these uniforms were not fit for {{the heat of the}} lower decks of a ship. Non-commissioned officers wore a variety of uniforms, or even regular clothing.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1872, Rainilaiarivony {{worked to}} {{modernize}} the army {{with the assistance of}} a British military instructor, who was hired to recruit, train and manage its soldiers. Rainilaiarivony purchased new local and imported firearms, reintroduced regular exercises and reorganized the ranking system. He prohibited the purchasing <b>of</b> <b>rank</b> promotions or exemptions from military service and instituted free medical care for soldiers in 1876. The following year Rainilaiarivony introduced the mandatory conscription of 5,000 Malagasy from each of the island's six provinces to serve five years in the royal army, swelling its ranks to over 30,000 soldiers.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, we {{modify the}} {{standard}} definition <b>of</b> moments <b>of</b> <b>ranks</b> and cranks such that odd moments no longer trivially vanish. Denoting the new k-th rank (resp. crank) moments by N¯k(n) (resp. M¯k(n)), we prove the following inequality {{between the first}} rank and crank moments:M¯ 1 (n) >N¯ 1 (n). This inequality motivates us to study a new counting function, ospt(n), which is equal to M¯ 1 (n) −N¯ 1 (n). We also discuss higher order moments <b>of</b> <b>ranks</b> and cranks. Surprisingly, for every higher order moments <b>of</b> <b>ranks</b> and cranks, the following inequality holds:M¯k(n) >N¯k(n). This extends F. G.

5|$|Burnside {{was ordered}} to take the IX Corps back to the Eastern Theater, where he built {{it up to a}} {{strength}} of over 21,000 in Annapolis, Maryland. The IX Corps fought in the Overland Campaign of May 1864 as an independent command, reporting initially to Grant; his corps was not assigned to the Army of the Potomac because Burnside outranked its commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, who had been a division commander under Burnside at Fredericksburg. This cumbersome arrangement was rectified on May 24 just before the Battle of North Anna, when Burnside agreed to waive his precedence <b>of</b> <b>rank</b> and was placed under Meade's direct command.|$|E

According to Eusebius, the purge was broadly successful, but Eusebius is confused about the technicalities of the event and his characterization of the overall size of the apostasy is ambiguous. Eusebius also attributes the initiative for the purge to Galerius, rather than Diocletian.|$|E
5|$|In March 1275 {{the forces}} of Bayan faced the army of Chancellor Jia Sidao, which was 130,000 strong; the end result was a decisive victory for Bayan, and Jia was forced to retreat after many deserted him.

Jia was effectively stripped <b>of</b> <b>rank,</b> title, and office and banished to Fujian in exile from the court; while en route to Fujian, {{he was killed by}} the same commander that was appointed to accompany him. After his death many of his supporters and opposing ministers submitted to Bayan. By 1276 the Yuan army had conquered nearly all of the Southern Song's territory, including the capital at Hangzhou.|$|E

5|$|In Vijayanagara, Madhura was {{the court}} poet of King HariharaII and King Deva RayaI under the {{patronage}} {{of their respective}} prime ministers. He is famous for {{his account of the}} 15th tirthankar titled Dharmanatha Purana (1385), written in a style similar to that of Jain poets of earlier centuries. Madhura is also credited with a poem about Gomateshwara of Shravanabelagola. Ayata Varma, who is tentatively dated to 1400, translated from Sanskrit a champu (mixed prose-verse) titled Ratna Karandaka describing Jain ideologies. Manjarasa, a feudatory king of Kallahalli and a Vijayanagara general <b>of</b> <b>rank,</b> wrote two books.

5|$|Kannada {{literature}} {{during this}} period consisted of writings relating to the socio-religious developments of the Veerashaiva and Vaishnava faiths, {{and to a lesser}} extent to that of Jainism. Writing on secular topics was popular throughout this period. Authorship of these writings was not limited to poets and scholars alone. Significant literary contributions were made by members of the royal family, their ministers, army commanders <b>of</b> <b>rank,</b> nobility and the various subordinate rulers. In addition, a vast body of devotional folk literature was written by musical bards, mystics and saint-poets, influencing society in the empire. Writers of this period popularised use of the native metres: shatpadi (six-line verse), sangatya (compositions meant to be sung to the accompaniment of a musical instrument), and tripadi (three-line verse).|$|E
