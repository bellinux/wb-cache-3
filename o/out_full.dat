5|$|The {{system was}} {{the topic of}} intense inter-service rivalry {{throughout}} its lifetime. When the ABM role {{was given to the}} Army in 1958, the United States Air Force began a long series of critiques on Zeus, both within defense circles and in the press. The Army returned these attacks in kind, taking <b>out</b> <b>full</b> page advertisements in popular mass market news magazines to promote Zeus, as well as spreading development contracts across many states in order to garner the maximum political support. As deployment neared in the early 1960s, the debate became a major political issue. The question ultimately became whether or not a system with limited effectiveness would be better than nothing at all.|$|E

Activists, such as Phil Sokolof, who took <b>out</b> <b>full</b> page ads in major newspapers, attacked the use of beef tallow in McDonald's french fries and urged fast-food companies to switch to vegetable oils.

25|$|Construction of SkyTrain fare {{gates was}} {{completed}} in May 2014 but they remained unclosed until April 2016 owing to multiple system problems. While open for the nearly two-year period, holders of paper-based monthly passes, bus-issued transfers, and FareSaver tickets continued {{to pass through the}} gates into the stations' fare-paid zones unimpeded, although they were subject to having their fare inspected by transit security or transit police once inside the fare-paid zone. Starting in April 2016, they were initially fully closed only during peak hours, with one gate remaining open during off-peak times for people with accessibility issues who could not reach their Compass Cards to the fare gates to tap in or <b>out.</b> <b>Full</b> implementation of the fare gates was also delayed by problems with Compass Cards when riders were tapping out as they exited buses. The tapping-out process on buses was too slow and did not always record the tap which—because the system initially deducted a three-zone fare until a tap-out was recorded and a refund was issued to those having only travelled one or two zones—often resulted in customers being charged for travelling through three zones when in fact they had only travelled through one or two. This was a serious setback for TransLink as the entire system was supposed to be operational by 2013. A solution was finally implemented where the requirement to tap out of buses was removed and all bus travel was considered as within a single zone, creating significant savings for those travelling multiple zones using buses only and in some cases changing transit usage patterns. The last fare gates left open for users with accessibility issues were closed on July 25, 2016, and the system has been in full operation since.|$|E

500|$|Don't Starve was {{developed}} and published by indie studio Klei Entertainment. The game began development {{as part of a}} 48-hour game jam in 2010. The team liked the idea but shelved it until two years later, when they had the time to flesh it <b>out.</b> <b>Full</b> development commenced in 2012, while Klei was nearing the end of the development process of Mark of the Ninja. This was during the heat of an industry trend of creating games in which players are dropped into a world with few instructions and a goal of survival. The torch of this movement was held by the 2011 sandbox game Minecraft. Member Kevin Forbes stated in an interview that Minecraft was one of the team's biggest influences, particularly its exploration elements. However, as the game was conceived as a [...] "weird experiment", the team's main goal was to innovate in terms of gameplay and aesthetics, specifically by adding a layer of emphasis on characterization and themes. Another influence was the 2005 Nintendo DS title Lost in Blue, which contains similar supernatural elements and a day/night cycle.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the third}} week of the dispute, the union and HIT both engaged in war of words in the press. HIT took <b>out</b> <b>full</b> page {{advertisements}} in almost all local newspapers on 20 April, except the anti-government Apple Daily, not merely defending itself but making personal attacks on Lee Cheuk-yan claiming he is using the workers to further his own political ends. HIT's advertisement in the English-language press said union demands for a 20 percent raise would [...] "create an impact across other industries and cause irreparable damage to Hong Kong." [...] Canning Fok, managing director of the Hutchsion Whampoa group, publicly alleged that Lee Cheuk-yan was not genuinely interested in helping the workers and harboured ulterior motives. He criticised Lee for [...] "resort to every means ... hoping that as the strike drags on, he can negotiate with Mr Li so as to boost his own publicity." [...] Fok likened the style of the dispute to the Cultural Revolution, [...] "where people are vilified on banners and posters". The SCMP estimated the series of adverts would have cost around HK$1 million. [...] Workers took out advertising space in Ming Pao Daily with a headline suggesting that KS Li did not really understands their situation.|$|E
2500|$|Crews of 4 Squadron Royal Flying Corps (RFC) {{observed}} the {{attack of the}} 36th Division beyond the German front line, where {{it was out of}} view from the British lines. At [...] an observer reported that German artillery from Grandcourt to Courcelette, was retiring and at [...] that {{there was no sign of}} German troops massing against the redoubt. After an hour, the 36th Division was reported still to be holding The Crucifix, south-east of the redoubt. The rest of the counter-attack force was ordered not to wait and Oberstleutnant Bram reached Stuff Redoubt to command the attack during the afternoon, having had to move on foot via Courcelette through the British bombardments. Moving around the redoubt was difficult due to the number of shells that had been fired into the area, tearing up the ground, the maze of trenches and the constant British barrage. Bram found an intact observation post and from it saw British troops just in front of the second position and troops of the 5th Company, BRIR 8 and Machine-Gun Marksman Detachment 89 (M-GMD 89). Groups 1 and 2 were nearly ready to attack but Group 3 was still struggling forward, the 8th Company going astray into the 51st Brigade area. Bram set up headquarters on the steps of a dug <b>out</b> <b>full</b> of wounded but could see little from Stuff Redoubt because of smoke and dust. Bram set the counter-attack for [...] and managed to liaise with Major Bayerköhler the Group 2 commander and the local artillery commander.|$|E
