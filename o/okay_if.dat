Her tattoos, which she began getting at age 19 as a form of self-expression, helped popularize tattoo fashion.

A common question from an IME Vendor, to a claimant or their attorney, may be to sign a waiver form. If the claimant signs this and goes to the appointment, this is <b>okay.</b> However, <b>if</b> an attorney's office refuses to sign it and won't let their client sign it, then the exam will have to be rescheduled to a later date to allow more notice time for the claimant. If a claimant attends the exam and their attorney says they'll sign the waiver, but never provides the signed waiver to the IME Vendor, the report that is dictated by the IME doctor will be precluded (meaning it is not valid because the waiver was never actually signed and returned).|$|R
