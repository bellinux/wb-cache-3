He returned to his former home in Newark in August, 1877, and after lingering for two months, died in his <b>old</b> <b>room,</b> where he had laboured for so long, on October 3, 1877.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Vida" [...] was {{released}} on 15 November 2010. It was filmed in Mexico and directed by Argentinian filmmaker Joaquín Cambre.

500|$|In June 1941, LeHand {{collapsed}} at a White House {{dinner party}} {{and two weeks}} later suffered a major stroke that left her partially paralyzed with little speech function. Goodwin says a factor that {{may have led to}} her illness was stress stemming from fears that the exiled Princess Märtha of Sweden, a Washington-area resident during World War II, had replaced her as FDR's favorite companion, occupying the seat next to him that had long been LeHand's in automobile rides. Kathryn Smith cites the stress of the world crisis that spring, as Britain stood alone against the Nazis, and the ill health of FDR, who had expected her to be at his bedside for weeks on end. [...] She had also become critical of FDR's leadership {{for the first time that}} spring, sharing her disappointment with Interior Secretary Harold L. Ickes, a close friend. FDR paid LeHand's medical bills and later made provisions for her in his will, stating that half the income of his estate would go to Eleanor and half to [...] "my friend Marguerite A. LeHand...for medical attention, care and treatment during her lifetime." [...] He also sent her to Warm Springs, where he hoped she could recover with the help of the physical therapy staff there. She was very unhappy in Warm Springs and may have tried to kill herself by eating chicken bones during the 1941 Christmas season. In early 1942, she spent some weeks in her <b>old</b> <b>room</b> at the White House, but quickly deteriorated due to her frustrations at not being able to help. After an incident in which she set the bed on fire—probably while smoking—it was agreed that LeHand would return to her sister's home in Somerville, Massachusetts, and she departed from Washington on May 15, 1942.|$|E

2500|$|From Darwin's description, the Plinian [...] "consisted of {{students}} and met in an underground room in the university {{for the sake of}} reading papers on natural science and discussing them." [...] Activities also included excursions to the countryside around Edinburgh. Meetings appear to have been weekly, until at the society's request, Jameson put their case to the university for a room in his museum for their meetings and their own small [...] "museum", but the outcome was that the rent on their <b>old</b> <b>room</b> was raised and they eventually agreed to rent the Speculative Society's room for meetings on alternate Tuesdays. Papers presented by the students were often of high quality, inspired by their lecturers. Commonly, papers took the form of a critique of the work of established experts, together with the student's own thoughts. They covered a wide range of subjects including the circulation of ocean currents, identification of plants found in the nearby countryside, the anatomy of sea animals they had collected and principles of classification.|$|E
