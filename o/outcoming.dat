25|$|Nonconducting {{specimens}} may be imaged {{without coating}} using an environmental SEM (ESEM) or low-voltage mode of SEM operation. In ESEM instruments the specimen {{is placed in}} a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately low at the electron gun. The high-pressure region around the sample in the ESEM neutralizes charge and provides an amplification of the secondary electron signal. Low-voltage SEM is typically conducted in an FEG-SEM because field emission guns (FEG) are capable of producing high primary electron brightness and small spot size even at low accelerating potentials. To prevent charging of non-conductive specimens, operating conditions must be adjusted such that the incoming beam current is equal to sum of <b>outcoming</b> secondary and backscattered electrons currents a condition that is more often met at accelerating voltages of 0.3–4 kV.|$|E

But the ridiculousness of such an act, to say nothing of its ingratitude, as quickly presented itself to me. Johnson had offered me only food and shelter; I could have claimed no more from the inn I had asked him to direct me to. I did not re-enter the house, but, lighting my last cigar, began to walk gloomily up and down the trail. With the <b>outcoming</b> of the stars it had grown lighter; through a wind opening in the trees I could see the heavy bulk of the opposite mountain, and beyond it a superior crest defined by a red line of forest fire, which, however, cast no reflection on the surrounding earth or sky. Faint woodland currents of air, still warm from the afternoon sun, stirred the leaves around me with long-drawn aromatic breaths. But these in time gave way to the steady Sierran night wind sweeping down from the higher summits, and rocking the tops of the tallest pines, yet leaving the tranquillity of the dark lower aisles unshaken. It was very quiet; there was no cry nor call of beast or bird in the darkness; the long rustle of the tree-tops sounded as faint as the far-off wash of distant seas. Nor did the resemblance cease there; the close-set files of the pines and cedars, stretching in illimitable ranks to the horizon, were filled with the immeasurable loneliness of an ocean shore. In this vast silence I began to think I understood the taciturnity of the dwellers in the solitary cabin.|$|E

40|$|The ventriloquism-effect {{describes}} an attracting influence of visual objects on perceived auditory directions. In the ventriloquist example the spectators will perceive the sound as {{coming from the}} mouth of the puppet as it’s lips make synchronous movements to the speech, although the ventriloquist speaks. When simulating directions in auditory displays the question comes up how the auditory directional shift towards the visual object is affected by a reduction of auditory directional information, i. e. the omission of individualized auditory directional cues. Two opposite <b>outcomings</b> could occur: (1) the directional shift increases as the visual modality gains more weight against the less accurate and reliable, ”weaker ” auditory modality, or (2) the directional shift is reduced through a reduction of cognitive congruence between both objects. Auditory-visual interaction was therefore investigated in three different listening environments: (1) real, anechoic space, (2) virtual acoustics using individual head-related transfer functions (HRTFs), or (3) selected non-individual HRTFs. The subjects task was to fixate visual objects while listening to auditory targets. Localization responses were collected as trial-by-trial aftereffects. A new localization method utilizing a laser-pointer was developed which allows for a fast and accurate collection of localization responses. By using a trackball as an input device the interference of proprioceptive information could be decoupled from the auditory-visual interaction experiment. The study showed auditory directional shifts of up to 7 ◦ towards visual objects in the real and in the individualized virtual environment. Directional shifts were statistically similar for both environments. Using selected non-individual HRTFs smaller shifts were observed. As experimental conditions were similar in all environments except for the directional presentation the results suggest that auditory-visual interaction is dependent on the presentation of auditory directional cues. 1...|$|R

The necessity of investigation of such informative indicators of the fetus biophysical profile of the pregnant with rhesus-sensibilization as the high-water and placenta thickening along with the conventional parameters of the fetus biophisical profile. The significance and peculiarities of the fetus biophysical profile of the pregnant with rhesus-sensibilization have been revealed depending on the degree of heaviness of the hemolytic disease. The prognosing importance of the fetus biophysical profile of the pregnant with rhesus-sensibilization has been determined. The dependence of the degree of heaviness of the new-born hemolytic disease and antenatal evaluation of the fetus biophysical profile has been established. It has been shown, that as far as the expression of the total evaluation of the biophysical indicators of the fetus, the degree of its state disturbance with the hemolytic disease can be considered. The frequency of the unfavourable perinatal <b>outcomings</b> increases as the number of the fetus pathological parameters increases also.

40|$|PosterRecent {{studies show}} that {{rockfall}} activity has increased along the three past decades in high mountain areas, and permafrost degradation {{is regarded as the}} main triggering factor. 433 rockfalls affecting the steep rockwalls of the Mont Blanc massif have been inventoried and documented (time and precise location, topographical and geological settings, volume, conditions, etc.) from 2007 to 2011. With the aim of better understanding geomorphic processes, we address questions about the thermal state of the unstable rockwalls within this study area. A statistical model of the Mean Annual Rock Surface Temperature (MARST) for the 1961 - 1990 period has been implemented on a 4 -m-resolution DEM of the Mont Blanc massif. The model runs with Potential Incoming Solar radiation (PISR) calculated with GIS tools and air temperature parameters computed from Chamonix Météo France's records. 87 rockfalls are located at the geographical margins of the DEM, where the PISR calculation doesn't take account of the surrounding hillshading and biased MARST simulation. Thus, only 346 rockfalls were kept and linked to a MARST value after data sorting. Preliminary results show that rockfalls occurred over a modelled MARST range of - 6 °C to 5 °C. MARSTs ranging from - 2. 5 °C to 2. 5 °C encompass about 60 % of the rockfalls. The mean MARST value for the 346 rockfalls is of - 0. 9 °C. Simulated warm permafrost areas (> - 2 C) are therefore appearing as the most affected by instabilities. These first observations reinforce the hypothesis that permafrost degradation is likely the dominant triggering factor of these rockfalls. The 1961 - 1990 period is supposed to be representative of the conditions at depth that are not affected by the recent climate warming. This means that the here presented results are mainly valuable for rockfalls related to pluri-decadal signal. But they also suggest that MARST model is an interesting tool to explore the link between rockwall instability and permafrost state. Simulations at various time scales would allow more precise reconstruction of the bedrock temperature during each year of rockfalls.

The choice and relationship between them tell us what message we are trying to convey and, what is more, how we express it.

In my Master's thesis, I focus on the relationship between colour and typography on a poster as {{a means of}} art expression, and, although the power of a poster depends on many factors, I tackle the issue through theoretical and empirical research, from two points of view. In the theoretical part of the thesis, I research the definition of a poster, types of a poster and its history. I pay particular attention to seven colour contrasts based on Johannes Itten, to emotional and functional meaning of colours and their psychologically-symbolic effect. I define the typography, its meaning and history. I research the relationship between the outlook and text as well. The research approach used is a theoretical one, by using the method of literature study and overview of resources open to public on the internet. Moreover, I also make a formal art analysis of twentyone posters of different authors, crucial for the research, with the help of which I verify the <b>outcomings</b> of the theoretical research on the case of specific art forms of posters.
