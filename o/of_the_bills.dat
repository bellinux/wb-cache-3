5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> (in earlier times, the entire text <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills).</b> The Clerk of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.|$|E
5|$|On September 10, Delegate C. Harrison Mann {{introduced}} 16 bills {{aimed at}} curbing the NAACP in Virginia. Five <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> expanded the state's definitions of barratry, champerty, and maintenance. The eleven other bills collectively required the following groups {{to file a}} financial report and membership list annually with state: any group which promotes or opposes state legislation aimed at any race; any organization attempting to influence public opinion on behalf of any race; or any group raising funds to employ legal counsel in connection with racial litigation.|$|E

50|$|Each Bill {{consists}} of five main parts: the long title, the short title, the interpretation clause, <b>the</b> main body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> and <b>the</b> objects and reasons. The long title is a description <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> and covers <b>the</b> intent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill.</b> <b>The</b> Short title follows the long title and labels <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> for identification purposes. The short title sometimes also, contains the commencement clause, which states when <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> will have legal force. The short title {{in turn is}} followed by the interpretation clause, which defines certain words and phrases used in <b>the</b> <b>Bill.</b> <b>The</b> body <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> consists <b>of</b> all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other clauses, which contain <b>the</b> provisions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill,</b> that is, they contain all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> measures that <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> is enacting. <b>The</b> objects and reasons is <b>the</b> final part <b>of</b> a Bill and it seeks to explain in layman’s terms <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bill</b> and <b>the</b> reason why it is necessary.|$|R

5|$|Authoritarian rule {{under the}} Kuomintang ended {{gradually}} through {{a transition to}} democracy, which was marked by the lifting of martial law in 1987. Soon after, the KMT transitioned to being merely one party within a democratic system, though maintaining {{a high degree of}} power in aboriginal districts through an established system of patronage networks. The KMT continued to hold the reins of power for another decade under President Lee Teng-hui. However, they did so as an elected government rather than a dictatorial power. The elected KMT government supported many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> that had been promoted by aboriginal groups. The tenth amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China also stipulates that the government would protect and preserve aboriginal culture and languages and also encourage them to participate in politics.|$|E
5|$|Six <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> {{that had}} been the subject of the double {{dissolution}} were introduced in Parliament a third time and, as expected, were again rejected by the Senate. Section 57 of the Constitution provides that, after a double dissolution election, if bills {{that had been}} rejected twice by the Senate in the previous parliament were again passed by the House and again rejected by the Senate, they could then be put to a joint sitting of both houses. On 30 July, Whitlam gained Kerr's agreement for a joint sitting, which was set for 6–7 August 1974. The joint sitting, the only one in Australia's history under Section 57, passed all six bills, including the enabling legislation for Medibank.|$|E
5|$|The CCE's {{two bills}} were {{submitted}} to Parliament {{at the same}} time as a large number of other bills for underground railways in the capital. As it had done in 1892, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor to review the bills. By the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was almost over and the promoters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> were asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session. Bills No. 1 and No. 2 were resubmitted in November 1901 together with a new bill – bill No. 3. The new bill modified the route of the proposed extension to Golders Green and added a short extension running beneath Charing Cross main line station to the Victoria Embankment where it would provide an interchange with the existing MDR station (then called Charing Cross).|$|E

50|$|During <b>the</b> passage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> Churchill praised Butler in <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Commons (5 June 1935) but not Hoare. Baldwin {{replaced}} Ramsay MacDonald as Prime Minister (7 June 1935) during <b>the</b> Third reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> In <b>the</b> resulting reshuffle Hoare became Foreign Secretary and was succeeded as India Secretary by Lord Zetland, so Butler had {{to steer}} <b>the</b> final stages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> through <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Commons; Lord Dunglass attributed <b>the</b> success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> which became <b>the</b> Government <b>of</b> India Act 1935, to him.|$|R
5|$|The CLR {{bill was}} {{one of more than}} a dozen tube railway bills {{submitted}} to Parliament for the 1901 session, To review the bills on an equal basis, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor, but by the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was almost over and the promoters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> were asked to resubmit them for the following 1902 session. Among the committee's recommendations were the withdrawal of the CLR's City loop, and that a quick, tube route from Hammersmith to the City of London would benefit London's commuters.|$|E

He heads to the tiny country of Cagliostro, the rumoured source <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills,</b> and attempts to save the runaway Clarisse from the Count Cagliostro's men. Lupin enlists his associates, Jigen and Goemon, and sends his calling card to the Count to get Inspector Zenigata, his longtime nemesis, to the castle. After becoming trapped in the dungeon under the castle, Lupin and Zenigata form a pact to escape and foil the Count's counterfeit operation and save Clarisse from her forced marriage to the Count.|$|E
5|$|The Jets {{opened their}} 2012 season against the Buffalo Bills with Sanchez {{completing}} 19 of his 27 passes for 266 yards, 3 touchdowns and an interception in a 48–28 rout <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bills.</b> In the subsequent four games, Sanchez {{became the first}} quarterback since Stoney Case in 1999 to complete under 50% of his passes in four straight contests as the Jets fell to a 2–3 record. This prompted fierce criticism from {{the media and the}} fans in regards to Sanchez's continued accuracy issues and prompted calls for the promotion of Tim Tebow. Sanchez snapped this streak against the Indianapolis Colts on October 14, 2012 completing 11 of his 18 passes for 82 yards and throwing for 2 touchdowns in a 35–9 victory over Indianapolis.|$|E

5|$|Turmoil {{marked the}} {{legislative}} sessions of Brown's term; his supporters had been either {{unwilling or unable}} to influence the rest of the Democratic slate, and tensions over the currency issue soon split the administration. Attorney General William Jackson Hendricks, Treasurer Henry S. Hale, and Auditor Luke C. Norman were all free silver supporters and feuded with Brown and his (appointed) secretary of state, John W. Headley, throughout Brown's term. Over time, the rift deepened and spread to the entire Democratic party. Brown also frequently clashed with the legislature and vetoed several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> it passed; none of his vetoes were ever overridden.|$|E
5|$|Vice-President Millard Fillmore {{ascended to}} the {{presidency}} upon Taylor's death and offered Crittenden the post of Attorney General. Believing the rift in the Whig Party was now much improved, he accepted the offer and resigned the governorship in 1850. Fillmore, an opponent of slavery, requested an opinion from Crittenden on {{the constitutionality of the}} fugitive slave law, one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> involved in the Compromise of 1850. Specifically, he asked if the law suspended the writ of habeas corpus. Crittenden said that it did not, opining that it discharged a duty placed on Congress by the Constitution to return runaway slaves. Crittenden's opinion was probably motivated by a desire to see the Compromise pass and avert further sectional tension. Fillmore, his misgivings assuaged, signed the bill, keeping the Compromise intact.|$|E
5|$|Stanley {{called the}} General Assembly into special session in February 1917. At issue was reformation of the state's tax code, which Stanley felt {{unjustly}} burdened agricultural interests. The state was also incurring large deficits, ranging from $100,000 to $700,000 annually. Though Kentucky was {{in better shape}} financially than many of its peers, Stanley still sought to balance the budget. The session lasted sixty days, and the legislature passed of many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> he advocated. The most significant created a three-member state tax commission, chaired by M. M. Logan. Additional taxes were passed on distilled spirits, oil production, race tracks, and corporate licenses. Assessments {{on the value of}} property, which had typically been evaluated at one-third to one-half of fair market price, rose dramatically. To balance this increase, legislators reduced the tax rates on certain types of property. With the dramatic increase in funds yielded by the special session, the General Assembly approved funding increases in nearly every part of state government, including higher education. The State Board of Health was given expanded powers, and county boards of health were established.|$|E

50|$|In {{the second}} reading, which in theory is {{supposed}} to occur two weekends after the first reading, a debate on <b>the</b> general principles <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> {{is followed by a}} vote.

5|$|The Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR) is a non-elected {{government}} body in Singapore established in 1970, the main function {{of which is}} to scrutinize most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bills</b> passed by Parliament to ensure that they do not discriminate against any racial or religious community. If the Council feels that any provision in a bill amounts to a differentiating measure, it will report its findings to Parliament and refer the bill back to Parliament for reconsideration. The Council also examines subsidiary legislation and statutes in force on 9 January 1970. One member of the PCMR is nominated by the Chairman to the Presidential Elections Committee, which is empowered to ensure that candidates for the office of President have the qualifications required by the Constitution. The President also appoints and dismisses the chairman and members of the Presidential Council for Religious Harmony ("PCRH"), established by the , on the advice of the PCMR, and the PCMR is responsible for determining whether PCRH members who are not representatives of major religions in Singapore have distinguished themselves in public service or community relations in Singapore.|$|E
