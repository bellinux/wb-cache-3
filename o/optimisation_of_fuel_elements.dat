The measured results for <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> with decay periods of more than one year are in good agreement with the data from ORIGEN. In the case <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> with shorter decay periods (approx. 150 days) in part considerably lower values were measured which {{can be explained by the}} fact that the power gradient in time <b>of</b> the <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> in the reactor can vary considerably whereas mean are included in the ORIGEN computations assuming full-load operation.

40|$|Nuclear {{reactors}} {{for space}} research purposes should {{be equipped with}} incore <b>fuel</b> <b>elements.</b> In that connection the question was studied if incore <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> might also be applied for economic electricity generation, because they lead {{to increase the efficiency}} rate of the total power plant. The computation of a high-temperature reactor of 600 MW(e) showed that for the wanted thermal neutron spectrum at which radiation damalte <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> can be kept possibly low, the parasitic absorption in the structure materials tungsten and niobium will be too high. In order to achieve reactor criticality, a high fission inventory is required.

40|$|New {{semi-automatic}} search {{options for}} maximum keff of systems having a given number <b>of</b> fixed composition <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> were successfully developed for SMORES – a new prototypic analysis sequence of SCALE- 5. 0. They {{are useful for}} identifying that distance between the <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> {{that will result in}} maximum keff. The new optimization algorithms were tested by applying them to identify the maximum keff thermal systems could have when made of a given number <b>of</b> fixed composition <b>fuel</b> <b>elements,</b> a moderator and a reflector. It was found that the optimal systems generally feature non-uniform spacing <b>of</b> the <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> – the optimal spacing tends to increase from the center towards the reflector. The spacing non-uniformity depends on the combination of moderator and reflector materials, on the number <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> in the system and on the reflector thickness. The general trend is increasing spacing width with reduction in the number <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> slabs and with reduction in reflector thickness. Particularly large can be the spacing of the outermost to the next-to-outermost <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> when using very low absorbing moderator, such as graphite, along with a relatively absorbing reflector such as water. When using a thick low absorbing reflector, such as graphite, the spacing <b>of</b> the <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> is nearly uniform and only slightly larger than the optimal spacing in an infinite lattice. Otherwise the optimal spacing can be significantly larger than the optimal infinite lattice spacing. Key Words: Maximum keff; Optimization; SMORES; SCALE- 5. 0 1...|$|R

5000|$|A marine nuclear {{propulsion}} plant must {{be designed to}} be highly reliable and self-sufficient, requiring minimal maintenance and repairs, which {{might have to be}} undertaken many thousands of miles from its home port. One of the technical difficulties in designing <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> for a seagoing nuclear reactor is the creation <b>of</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> which will withstand a large amount <b>of</b> radiation damage. <b>Fuel</b> <b>elements</b> may crack over time and gas bubbles may form. The fuel used in marine reactors is a metal-zirconium alloy rather than the ceramic UO2 (uranium oxide) often used in land-based reactors. Marine reactors are designed for long core life, enabled by the relatively high enrichment of the uranium and by incorporating a [...] "burnable poison" [...] in the <b>fuel</b> <b>elements,</b> which is slowly depleted as the <b>fuel</b> <b>elements</b> age and become less reactive.
