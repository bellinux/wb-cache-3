40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{studies the}} physics of room-temperature optical nonlinearities in GaAs and their application to the <b>optical</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gates.</b> The microscopic origins of the room-temperature optical nonlinearities in GaAs are investigated experimentally and theoretically. The data of nonlinear absorption measurement are analyzed {{in the framework of}} a semiconductor plasma theory in combination with excitation-dependent line broadening. The importance of the plasma screening of the continuum-state Coulomb enhancement and band filling are emphasized for GaAs at room temperature. Optical bistability and <b>optical</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gating</b> are direct consequences of the nonlinear refractive index changes in etalons. The nonlinear index changes are directly measured by a new technique of observing the Fabry-Perot transmission peak shift using the self-photoluminescence as a broad-band source. The validity of a Kramers-Kronig technique under quasi-steady state conditions is crosschecked by an independent measurement of Δn under identical pumping conditions. Thermal index changes are also directly measured to establish the criteria on the temperature stability condition that is needed for reliable operation of devices based on dispersive nonlinearities. <b>Optical</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gates</b> based on dispersive optical nonlinearities may be the critical components of an all-optical computer in the future. Five <b>optical</b> <b>logic</b> functions are demonstrated in a nonlinear GaAs/AlGaAs MQW etalon. Specially designed dielectric mirrors are used to observe low-energy (3 -pJ) operation of <b>optical</b> <b>logic</b> <b>gates.</b> Parallel operation using as many as eight <b>optical</b> <b>logic</b> devices is achieved with Wollaston prisms.

A multi-input, logically complete NOR gate also can be implemented in a cascaded system. Spatial solitons result from a balance between linear diffraction and nonlinear self-focusing, and their interactions may one day provide a means for ultrafast optical switching and computing.
