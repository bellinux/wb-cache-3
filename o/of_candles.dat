5|$|Despite the {{perceived}} improbability of landfall {{in the days}} preceding the storm's passage, the West Palm Beach chapter of the American Red Cross began preparing for the storm. Dr. William J. Buck, likely the only doctor between Pahokee and Moore Haven and also president of the Belle Glade town council {{and the founder of}} the town's American Legion post, was skeptical of the Weather Bureau's predictions of the storm missing South Florida. He and his legionnaires warned residents in the Lake Okeechobee region of the approaching cyclone. At South Bay, Frank Schuster made several car trips to save 211 people by transporting them to higher ground. The Seminoles at the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation in Glades County evacuated to higher ground after observing retreating wildlife. Hours before the storm made landfall, many in the communities surrounding Lake Okeechobee either crowded into a house or evacuated to the building they believed was securest, such as the Belle Glade Hotel, the Glades Hotel, and Henry Martin's store in Belle Glade, with the Glades Hotel sheltering 20 people and the Belle Glade Hotel having nearly 150 refugees. About 500 people in Lake Worth were sheltered inside the Gulf Stream Hotel during the storm. In West Palm Beach, food and thousands <b>of</b> <b>candles,</b> kerosene lamps, and boards were sold on September 16. A number of residents boarded up their homes and then secured their ornamental trees and plants. At the building then being used as the Palm Beach County Courthouse, approximately 500 people sought shelter inside. In Jupiter, 20 people sought refuge in a grocery store, while 25 others stayed at a newly constructed elementary school. A number of African Americans took shelter in a school building in West Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Oliver Evans {{was born}} in Newport, Delaware on September 13, 1755 to Charles and Ann Stalcop Evans. His father was a cordwainer by trade, though he {{purchased}} a large farm {{to the north of}} Newport on the Red Clay Creek and moved his family there when Oliver was still in his infancy. Oliver was the fifth of twelve children; he had four sisters and seven brothers. Little else is known of Evans's early life, and surviving records provide few details as to his formative years. The nature and location of his early education has not been preserved, however his literacy was demonstrably strong from a young age, both as a writer and an avid reader on technical subjects. Aged 17, Evans was apprenticed to a wheelwright and wagon-maker in Newport. An anecdote from the period recalls that his master, an illiterate and extremely frugal man, forbade Evans the use <b>of</b> <b>candles</b> to illuminate his reading in the evenings. Evans found another way by collecting scraps and shavings of wood from his work during the day to serve as fuel for small fires. The Revolutionary War began when Evans was 19. He enlisted in a Delaware militia company, but saw no active service during the war.|$|E

Such views were often expressed by individual church leaders, such as the famous example of Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, although many others leant the other way, and encouraged and commissioned art for their churches. Bernard was in fact only opposed to decorative imagery in monasteries that was not specifically religious, and popular preachers like Saint Bernardino of Siena and Savonarola regularly targeted secular images owned by the laiety.|$|E

The transitions are often apparent in fires, in which the color emitted closest to the fuel is white, with an orange section above it, and reddish flames the highest of all.

Throughout the past time the contests have promoted creation <b>of</b> <b>candle</b> with different styles contests and stories which are valuable for studying and dissemination in the future. The purposes of this research were to examine the background of the Buddhist Lent <b>candle</b> trees, elements <b>of</b> contests and evaluation <b>of</b> <b>candle</b> trees awarded on Lent candle contests in Ubon Ratchathani province from 2003 - 2007. The research area covered Ubon Ratchathani provinces where Buddhist Lent candle were created for contests which were the most famous in Thailand. The research procedure used the qualitative research methodology. Data were collected from related literature and field studies using survey, observations, interviews and focus group discussion from a group of totally 35 informants. The findings were presented by means of a descriptive analysis. The results reviewed that candle trees had been made for neatness contests since 1927. In 1977 the tradition <b>of</b> Lent <b>candle</b> procession week was held to be a grand annual festival <b>of</b> the province. <b>Candle</b> trees were contested in 3 types. Later two elements of contest consisted <b>of</b> large-sized <b>candle</b> tree and small-sized <b>candle</b> tree. Concepts <b>of</b> <b>candle</b> tree creation were from the criteria determined by Ubon Ratchathani province. The criteria were different from year to year. The stories to created as candle trees were about Buddhism local culture and identities of Ubon Ratchathani. The same criteria were use for decision making in every type by considering from candle tree base and all elements, The evaluation <b>of</b> <b>candle</b> trees awarded in contests could be divided into 3 aspects: contests the stories appearing the most involved the Lord Buddha stories. The shape of the Buddha images used was in sitting style. There were 4 forms using structural line to determine the front part, middle part and the end part at different heights. The Buddhist Lent candle trees creation was originate from belief in Buddhism presented by Buddhists to Buddhism monks who stayed at their monasteries. Ubon Ratchathani province has adhered to this tradition from ancient time up to present. The tradition has been promoted by the state and private sectors. It is a grand traditional festival. There are candle trees contest every year. Most of the contents appearing at the candle trees in contests are stories in Buddhism. However, some year there are contents concerning His Majesty the King in different auspicious occasion.
