5|$|ACLU {{leadership}} was divided {{on how to}} challenge the civil rights violations. One faction, including Baldwin, Arthur Garfield Hays and Norman Thomas, believed that direct, militant action was the best path. Hays {{was the first of}} many successful attorneys that relinquished their private practices to work for the ACLU. Another group, including Walter Nelles and Walter Pollak felt that lawsuits taken to the Supreme Court were the best way to achieve change. Both groups worked in tandem, but equally revered the Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>and</b> the US Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{approach}} to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, {{which is based}} on selective immigration, social integration, and suppression of far-right politics, has wide public support. Government policies such as publicly funded health care, higher taxation to redistribute wealth, the outlawing of capital punishment, strong efforts to eliminate poverty, strict gun control, and the legalization of same-sex marriage are further social indicators of Canada's political and cultural values. Canadians also identify with the country's health care institutions, peacekeeping, the National park system and the Canadian Charter <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>and</b> Freedoms.|$|E

5|$|Multiculturalism in Canada {{was adopted}} as the {{official}} policy of the government during the premiership of Pierre Trudeau in the 1970s and 1980s. The Canadian government has often {{been described as the}} instigator of multicultural ideology, because of its public emphasis on the social importance of immigration. Multiculturalism is administered by the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and reflected in the law through the Canadian Multiculturalism Act and section 27 of the Canadian Charter <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>and</b> Freedoms.|$|E

5|$|On a rainy Sunday of 1951, {{the crowd}} left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot, refusing to catch any trams, and {{surprising}} the Francoist authorities.

5|$|The Second Amendment {{protects the}} {{individual}} {{right to keep}} and bear arms. The concept of such a right existed within English common law long before the enactment of the Bill of Rights. First codified in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>and</b> the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E
5|$|A {{multitude}} of languages {{are used by}} Canadians, with English and French (the official languages) being the mother tongues of approximately 60% and 20% of Canadians, respectively. Nearly 6.8million Canadians listed a non-official language as their mother tongue. Some {{of the most common}} non-official first languages include Chinese (mainly Cantonese; 1,072,555 first-language speakers), Punjabi (430,705), Spanish (410,670), German (409,200), and Italian (407,490). Canada's federal government practices official bilingualism, which is applied by the Commissioner of Official Languages in consonance with Section 16 of the Canadian Charter <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>and</b> Freedoms and the Federal Official Languages Act English and French have equal status in federal courts, parliament, and in all federal institutions. Citizens have the right, where there is sufficient demand, to receive federal government services in either English or French and official-language minorities are guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.|$|E

5|$|At this point, Cochrane has {{completed}} {{the first two}} steps introducing his interest-based rights approach; the third is outlining the approach itself as the appropriate means of understanding obligations to animals in political communities. Utilitarianism, as advocated by Peter Singer, is rejected because of its failure to take individuals seriously enough; Cochrane desires an account which takes well-being seriously but is not purely aggregative. This, he suggests, is one based on interest rights. After explicating {{the details of his}} interest-based rights approach, Cochrane defends it against the charge that it would result in an unworkably large number <b>of</b> <b>rights,</b> <b>and</b> that rights approaches are too rationalistic.|$|E
5|$|But several {{defining}} {{features of}} modern Canada {{can be traced}} back to Diefenbaker. Diefenbaker's Bill of Rights remains in effect, and signalled the change in Canadian political culture that would eventually bring about the Canadian Charter <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>and</b> Freedoms, which came into force after his death. Diefenbaker was the first to appoint women and ethnic minorities to Cabinet. It was under Diefenbaker that Canada finally achieved universal adult suffrage, with the granting of the vote to Native Canadians in 1960. The removal of explicit racial discrimination from the criteria for admission to Canada under the Immigration Act of 1961 was a factor in the creation of today's multi-cultural and multi-ethnic Canada.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker was {{repeatedly}} {{a candidate for}} the PC leadership. He gained that party position in 1956, on his third attempt. In 1957, he led the Tories to their first electoral victory in 27 years; a year later he called a snap election and spearheaded them to one of their greatest triumphs. Diefenbaker appointed the first female minister in Canadian history to his Cabinet, as well as the first aboriginal member of the Senate. During his six years as Prime Minister, his government obtained passage of the Canadian Bill <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>and</b> granted the vote to the First Nations and Inuit peoples. In foreign policy, his stance against apartheid helped secure the departure of South Africa from the Commonwealth of Nations, but his indecision on whether to accept Bomarc nuclear missiles from the United States led to his government's downfall. Diefenbaker is also remembered {{for his role in the}} 1959 cancellation of the Avro Arrow project.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, the Supreme Court of Canada made {{a ruling}} in R.v. Butler which {{incorporated}} {{some elements of}} Dworkin and MacKinnon's legal work on pornography into the existing Canadian obscenity law. In Butler, the Court held that Canadian obscenity law violated Canadian citizens' rights to free speech under the Canadian Charter <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>and</b> Freedoms if enforced on grounds of morality or community standards of decency; but that obscenity law could be enforced constitutionally against some pornography {{on the basis of}} the Charter's guarantees of sex equality. The Court's decision cited extensively from briefs prepared by the Women's Legal Education and Action Fund (LEAF), with the support and participation of Catharine MacKinnon.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court held in Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer) (2002), that a {{statutory}} provision prohibiting prisoners serving {{a sentence of}} two years or more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by section 3 of the Canadian Charter <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>and</b> Freedoms. The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on inclusiveness, democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be {{denied the right to}} vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.|$|E
5|$|In {{an effort}} to remedy the {{perceived}} defects of the Articles of Confederation, delegates were first sent to the Annapolis Convention in 1786 {{and then to the}} Philadelphia Convention in 1787, where they drafted the United States Constitution, which was then sent to the states for ratification or rejection. Hancock, who was not present at the Philadelphia Convention, had misgivings about the new Constitution's lack of a bill <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> its shift of power to a central government. In January 1788, Hancock was elected president of the Massachusetts ratifying convention, although he was ill and not present when the convention began. Hancock mostly remained silent during the contentious debates, but as the convention was drawing to close, he gave a speech in favor of ratification. For the first time in years, Samuel Adams supported Hancock's position. Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168. Hancock's support was probably a deciding factor in the ratification.|$|E

5|$|In the 1980s, Franklin {{participated in}} an {{organized}} campaign to win the right for conscientious objectors to redirect part of their income taxes from military uses to peaceful purposes. Her 1987 paper, written to support the campaign, argued that the well-recognized right to refuse military service on grounds of conscience should be extended to include the right to refuse to pay taxes for war preparations. Franklin asserted that the freedom of conscience provision of the Canadian Charter <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>and</b> Freedoms guaranteed this form of conscientious objection. Her paper was {{to be part of}} an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The lower courts had convicted those withholding part of their taxes of violating the Income Tax Act. In 1990 however, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.|$|E
5|$|In the 1st United States Congress, {{following}} the state legislatures' request, James Madison proposed twenty constitutional amendments based on state bills <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> <b>and</b> English {{sources such as}} the Bill of Rights 1689; one of these was a prohibition against quartering troops in private homes. Several revisions to the future Third Amendment were proposed in Congress, which chiefly differed {{in the way in}} which peace and war were distinguished (including the possibility of a situation, such as unrest, which was neither peace nor war), and whether the executive or the legislature would have the authority to authorize quartering. However, the amendment ultimately passed Congress almost unchanged and by unanimous vote. Congress reduced Madison's proposed twenty amendments to twelve, and these were submitted to the states for ratification on September 25, 1789.|$|E
5|$|Other {{significant}} parties {{formed in}} the era were the Serb People's Independent Party, which later formed the Croat-Serb Coalition with the Party <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>and</b> other Croat and Serb parties. The Coalition ruled Croatia between 1903 and 1918. The leaders of the Coalition were Frano Supilo and Svetozar Pribićević. The Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), established in 1904 and led by Stjepan Radić, advocated Croatian autonomy but achieved only moderate gains by 1918. In Dalmatia, {{the two major parties}} were the People's Party – a branch of the People's Party active in Croatia-Slavonia – and the Autonomist Party, advocating maintaining autonomy of Dalmatia, opposite to the People's Party demands for unification of Croatia-Slavonia and Dalmatia. The Autonomist Party, most notably led by Antonio Bajamonti, was also linked to Italian irredentism. By 1900, the Party of Rights had made considerable gains in Dalmatia. The Autonomists won the first three elections, but all elections since 1870 were won by the People's Party. In the period 18611918 there were seventeen elections in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia and ten in the Kingdom of Dalmatia.|$|E
