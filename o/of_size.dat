40|$|Using {{orthogonal}} array {{method and}} analysis <b>of</b> variance, the <b>sizing</b> process for Water-jet Looms is fully investigated {{and the effects}} of four main factors and their interactions on the properties <b>of</b> <b>sized</b> filaments in wet are also analyzed. Among mechanical parameters, the abrasion-proof decreases very much, and the strength goes down slightly, but the elongation hardly changes in wet condition comparing with that in dry one. The type <b>of</b> <b>sizing</b> agents affects the properties <b>of</b> <b>sized</b> filaments most significantly. The properties <b>of</b> filaments <b>sized</b> by various sizing agents are quite different. Sizing agent No. 1 is the best one. The interactions between factors in sizing process also affected the properties <b>of</b> <b>sized</b> filaments. However, changing the single factor hardly causes the influence for the properties <b>of</b> <b>sized</b> filaments significantly. The optimum sizing conditions are suggested. © 2008 The Textile Machinery Society of Japan...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} <b>of</b> <b>sizing</b> constituent distribution on {{the properties}} <b>of</b> <b>sized</b> glass fibres (GFs) and corresponding polypropylene (PP) composites was studied by two-stage sizing application, i. e. applying silane coupling agent and polymeric film former at separate stages and with different sequences, {{in comparison with}} one-stage sizing application usually used. Surface properties <b>of</b> <b>sized</b> GFs and transverse tensile strength of unidirectional GF reinforced composites were studied using various surface and interface analysis methods and tensile testing, respectively. Two-stage technology achieved sized GFs with lower loss-on-ignition (LOI) and resulted in poor fibre-matrix adhesion strength. However, applying silane coupling agent at the first sizing stage with an increased roller speed achieved sized GFs with lower LOI but composites with mechanical properties quite close to those of composites based on one-stage technology. Moreover, the difference in surface properties <b>of</b> <b>sized</b> GFs is {{discussed in terms of}} the wetting ability difference <b>of</b> <b>sizing</b> constituents and the interactions between sizing components...|$|R

5|$|Meat ants {{engage in}} ritualised fights to {{maintain}} and resolve boundary disputes with neighbouring colonies. When individuals from separate colonies meet, they will engage each other until appeasement occurs. A meat ant detects a foreign worker by intense antennation and gaping of the mandibles, and will also stretch themselves upward to appear taller and larger, suggesting that meat ants {{do this in a}} display <b>of</b> <b>size</b> matching. Once the ants have finished fighting, they will groom themselves and search for another ant. Such disputes between colonies may continue for months or even years in the same area, and escalated fights that result in serious injury or death are rare.|$|E

5|$|The {{lineages}} of rorquals {{and right}} whales split almost 20mya. It is unknown where this occurred, {{but it is}} generally believed that they, like their descendants, followed plankton migrations. These primitive mysticetes had lost their heterodont dentition in favor of baleen, and {{are believed to have}} lived on a specialized benthic, plankton, or copepod diet like modern mysticetes. Mysticetes experienced their first radiation in the mid-Miocene. Balaenopterids grew bigger during this time, with species like Balaenoptera sibbaldina rivaling the blue whale in terms <b>of</b> <b>size.</b> It is thought this radiation was caused by global climate change and major tectonic activity when Antarctica and Australia separated from each other, creating the Antarctic Circumpolar Current.|$|E
