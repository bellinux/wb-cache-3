5000|$|The Garretson Outlet Bridge is a {{historic}} structure located north of Whiting, Iowa, United States. It carries 100th Street, a gravel road, over Garretson <b>Outlet</b> <b>Ditch</b> for 168 ft. [...] The Iowa Bridge Company of Des Moines held the bridge contract for Monona County when this bridge was built. They fabricated and erected the Warren pony truss with polygonal upper chords in 1913. Around {{the same time they}} had constructed other several small- and medium-scale bridges over a system of channelized streams and drainage ditches that had recently been completed across the county. This bridge was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.|$|E
5000|$|Dewart Lake, (formerly Lake Wawasee before Turkey Lake became Lake Wawasee), is {{a natural}} lake {{southwest}} of Syracuse in Kosciusko County, Indiana, United States. It was formed during the most recent glacial retreat of the Pleistocene era. Dewart Lake is a 551-acre (223 ha) natural lake, located three miles (4.8 km) south of Syracuse and three miles (4.8 km) east of Indiana State Road 15. 41 degrees 22' 03.31" [...] North Latitude x 85 degrees 46' 18.22" [...] West Longitude, 867.70 ft above Sea Level. 82 ft is the maximum depth with an average depth of 16.3 ft. It lies within the Elkhart River watershed and drains 5152 acre. Two small inlets enter {{on the east side}} and the <b>outlet,</b> Hammond <b>Ditch,</b> leaves the west side and flows to Waubee Lake. Large areas on the north and south sides of the lake are less than 5 ft deep. Hydraulic retention time is 601 days. Farming is the main watershed use, although woodlots and wetlands are present. Nearly all of the shoreline is residentially developed. Areas of natural shoreline and wetlands are present along the south shore and in the northeast corner adjacent to a private camp. A state-owned boat ramp is available in the northwest corner on CR 300E. Dewart Lake is moderately fertile. Its trophic index is 36. Enough oxygen is present for fish 20 deep but levels drop too low below 20 feet (less than 4 ppm.). Water clarity varies from 6 through 13 1/2 feet. The bottom is mostly sand and muck, but boulders and gravel are also present. Eurasian Water Millfol is the dominant submerged aquatic plant. (The lake was treated for this non-indeginoous plant in 2006.) Cattails, spatterdock and water lilies are the major emergent plants. In recent years, an extensive cattail stand along the south shore has been replaced with lilies. Some past management at Dewart Lake has been directed at maintaining the native fishery and creating walleye fishing opportunities.|$|R
40|$|Summary: Orifice-weir {{structures}} at <b>ditch</b> <b>outlets</b> {{are being}} used to reduce peak drainage rates and to store water during the growing season in poorly drained managed pine plantations. Earlier studies have shown their effectiveness on reducing drainage outflows while conserving water during the growing season. This study reports on criteria and preliminary guidelines for designing such outlets. The guidelines were developed using both observed data and DRAINLOB (a forestry version of DRAINMOD) simulations for multiple combinations of outlet sizes and four different poorly drained organic and mineral soils. Main objective functions chosen were reducing frequency of peak drainage rates and wet days with water table within 30 cm from the surface, and maximizing the days water table were within desired range of 45 to 120 cm depth during the growing season. Results show that the size and the depths of the orifice and the weir at the outlet primarily depend upon the main objective function chosen followed by the soil type and drainage area of the watershed. Wet days increased with smaller orifice sizes and shallower weir depths, Analyses showed that for the same drainage density and area, a larger orifice may be required in the organic soil to achieve the same reduction in wet days as in the mineral soil.

40|$|Runoff {{formation}} processes at {{the experimental}} plot (1600 m 2 ), the field (0. 06 km 2 ), {{and the small}} catchment (1. 36 km 2 ) with shallow groundwater table and dense drainage system in North Huaihe River Plain (the {{northern part of the}} Huaihe River Basin, China) were analyzed based on observed rainfall, runoff and groundwater table depth data of 30 storm events during the flood seasons from 1997 to 2008. At the outlet of the furrow of the experimental plot, only the surface runoff was collected and measured, whereas both the surface and subsurface runoffs were collected at the drainage <b>ditches</b> <b>outlets</b> of the field and the small catchment. The present study showed that the relatively narrow range of rainfall amounts resulted in significantly different runoff amounts at all the three scales. When the ground water is close to surface, the runoff amount is a great percentage of rainfall amount. Significant linear relationships between the difference of rainfall and runoff amounts and the changes in water table or the initial water table depth were found. When the 30 events were divided into three groups with initial water table (as a parameter indicating the antecedent moisture condition) shallower than 0. 5 m, deeper than 2. 3 m or between 0. 5 m and 2. 3 m, significant rainfall-runoff relationships existed for each group. These imply that saturation-excess surface flow dominated the runoff response, especially when water table is shallow. For almost all the events, the water table rose above the bottom of drainage ditch during the event, and the total runoff amounts were larger at the field and the catchment than that at the plot with only surface flow measured, showing a great contribution of subsurface flow. Groundwater table depth, not only reflecting the antecedent moisture conditions, but also influencing the lateral sub-surface flow to the drainage ditches, would be an important parameter dominating runoff formation process in catchment like the study area with shallow water table and dense drainage system...|$|R
