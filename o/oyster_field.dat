40|$|A closure {{plan for}} the South Oyster Focus Area (SOFA) is being {{implemented}} to assess the impacts {{of a series of}} experimental injections of microorganisms, tracers and chemical amendments on the chemical and physical properties of the aquifer. The proposed research addresses environmental monitoring of humic substances injected into the aquifer, as described in the Site Closure Plan for the South <b>Oyster</b> <b>Field</b> Research Site. The goal of the research is to demonstrate that the dissolved organic matter (DOM) in the groundwater at and downgradient from the injection site has returned to a pre-injection ï¿½baselineï¿½ conditions with respect to either the concentration or chemical composition of the DOM. For clarity, the humic solution injected during the experiment will be referred to as ï¿½humic injectate. ï¿½ The term ï¿½DOMï¿½ will refer to the organic material recovered in the groundwater, which includes the autochthonous groundwater DOM as well as any of the humic injectate remaining in the groundwater. Specific objectives include: ï¿½ Estimate the amount of humic material remaining in the aquifer at the completion of the push-pull experiment and the potential for environmental impacts due to release of humics retained on the sediments. ï¿½ Monitor the DOM concentrations in groundwater over time at the injection well and at sampling locations within the potential downgradient plume of the injected tracers. ï¿½ Evaluate the chemical composition of the DOM to determine whether the injection experiment had an impact of the chemical properties of the aquifer. The product of this research will be a contribution to the Site Closure Report documenting the impact of the humic experiments on the aquifer. Return of the aquifer to a ï¿½baselineï¿½ conditions will be achieved if the DOM concentrations in the groundwater are determined {{over the course of the}} research to have decreased to the pre-injection level, or if the chemical properties of the DOM are similar to that of the autochthonous DOM...|$|E

A strategy is proposed to apply these models in a supervised classification framework. This strategy includes a Content-Based Image Retrieval analysis applied on a texture database prior to the classification {{in order to identify}} which multivariate model performs the best in the context of application. Once identified, the best models are further applied in a supervised classification procedure by extracting texture features from a learning database as well as from regions obtained by a pre-segmentation of the image to classify.

Status of the Sydney {{rock oyster}} in a disease-afflicted estuary: {{persistence}} of wild populations despite severe impacts on culture counterparts [...] 3. Are native Saccostrea glomerata and invasive Crassostrea gigas oysters habitat equivalents for epibenthic communities in south-eastern Australia? [...] 4. Substrate or sink? Differences in settlement of Saccostrea glomerata larvae on non-native Crassostrea gigas and conspecifics {{is determined by}} spatial arrangement [...] 5. Differences in the shell strength of native and non-native oysters do not influence their susceptibility to a generalist predator [...] 6. General conclusions. As a consequence of rising global consumption of seafood and over-extraction of wild finand shell-fisheries, aquaculture is the fastest growing food production method in the world. Although in some instances aquaculture may benefit wild populations by deflecting harvest pressure away from these, in others it may have negative impacts {{as a consequence of}} facilitation of disease or biological invasion or where it results in genetic pollution of wild populations with selectively-bred genotypes. The oyster industry of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, is presently entirely dependent on aquaculture. Although the NSW industry historically cultured wild-caught native Sydney rock oysters (Saccostrea glomerata), in recent years high mortality of cultured oysters from QX disease has led to a shift towards culture of Sydney rock oysters selectively bred for disease resistance and non-native Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) that are unaffected by the disease. It is unknown how QX disease or the resulting strategies of management that have been applied to the aquaculture industry (culture of disease resistant Sydney rock or Pacific oysters) may impact wild populations of Sydney rock oysters, and their important ecosystem services, which include provision of habitat and food for associated communities of fish and invertebrates. This thesis determined: (1) how QX disease has impacted wild populations of Sydney rock oysters, both directly and indirectly as a result of any facilitation of Pacific oysters, and (2) whether wild-stock Sydney rock oysters, disease resistant Sydney rock oysters, and Pacific oysters are functionally equivalent in their provision of habitat and food to associated communities of invertebrates. [...] Sampling in the Hawkesbury River, NSW, where QX disease has produced aquaculture mortality of Sydney rock oysters of up to 90 %, revealed only a low (< 14 %) prevalence of the disease-causing parasite among wild Sydney rock oysters on rocky shores. Consequently, mortality rates of wild Sydney rock oysters remained low and {{there was no evidence of}} replacement of populations of Sydney rock oysters with disease-resistant Pacific <b>oysters.</b> <b>Field</b> and laboratory experiments showed that even under the scenario that aquaculture facilitates invasion of Pacific oysters or causes genetic modification of wild Sydney rock oyster populations, little change in the ecosystem services provided by oysters would be expected. Despite the more rapid growth and mortality rates of Pacific than Sydney rock oysters, the two produced habitat of similar complexity and supported similar communities of invertebrates, irrespective of genotype. Settlement of Sydney rock oyster larvae did not differ between Pacific and Sydney rock oysters in mixed species beds and when in mono-specific patches, the nonnative oyster enhanced larval settlement of Sydney rock oysters in high-flow environments, but decreased its settlement under low-flow, high-density conditions. The rapid growth of Pacific oysters had little impact on investment in anti-predator defences, such as shell strength and thickness, relative to Sydney rock oysters. Consequently, native oyster-boring whelks were capable of consuming Pacific oysters, although they consumed more of the Sydney rock oyster when both species were available. These results suggest that changes to the oyster aquaculture industry of NSW Australia are at present having little impact on wild oyster populations and their ecosystem services. The findings are consistent with other studies done elsewhere, which suggest there is often a high degree of redundancy in the services provided by native and nonnative oyster.

40|$|A {{model for}} bivalve growth was {{developed}} {{and the results were}} tested against field observations. The model is based on the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory and includes an extension of the standard DEB model to cope with changing food quantity and quality. At 4 different locations in the North Sea (Wadden Sea, Sean Gas <b>Field,</b> <b>Oyster</b> Grounds and Dogger Bank), labelled blue mussels Mytilus edulis were kept under natural conditions. Shell length was repeatedly measured for each mussel during the experiment, and dry weight was determined {{at the end of the}} experiment for some of the mussels. Temperature, salinity, chlorophyll concentration and Secchi depth (at the Wadden Sea location) were measured next to the experimental sites. Model performance was evaluated by comparing predicted and measured shell length, dry weight and growth at each location for each individual, without changing parameter values that were previously obtained from independent studies. The results show that the model was able to reproduce the main patterns of the observations, implying that the main metabolic processes at the individual level are well described. © Inter-Research 2012 · www. int-res. com...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} agreed that {{biological}} introductions can affect invaded habitats. The global extent of these impacts is, however, {{a matter of}} continuous discussion. The invasive isopod Cirolana harfordi is found in great abundances in oyster-beds in Australia. This species {{is reported to be}} a detritus feeder, a scavenger and a predator in its native range. Therefore, a major concern for managers {{is the extent to which}} this species impacts local habitats and the identification of the mechanisms driving its invasion. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of C. harfordi on the invaded habitat and the characteristics of the invaded habitat that affect its colonisation. As a predator, C. harfordi may affect resident assemblages. Observational and manipulative studies showed no evidence of impacts of C. harfordi on the assemblage. In addition, as a scavenger and a detritus feeder, C. harfordi may affect the amounts of organic matter. Observational studies showed no significant relationships between densities of C. harfordi and accumulated organic matter. Colonisation of oyster-beds by C. harfordi can be affected by the habitat provider and/or the receiving assemblage. To examine the effects of architectural vs. biological characteristics of <b>oysters,</b> a <b>field</b> experiment examining colonisation of different types of experimental oyster-beds by C. harfordi was done. Colonisation by C. harfordi showed no significant differences between treatments, but a trend suggesting facilitation by the chemical composition of the oysters was observed. A mesocosm experiment evaluating the effect of the receiving assemblage on colonisation by C. harfordi suggested that organisms in the receiving assemblage are facilitating and resisting the colonisation by C. harfordi at the same time. The results of this study provide information on the ecological processes affecting community assembly and are crucial to design efficient management strategies for C. harfordi.

40|$|Understanding how {{the density}} and spatial {{arrangement}} of invaders {{is critical to}} developing management strategies of pest species. The Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas, has been translocated {{around the world for}} aquaculture and in many instances has established wild populations. Relative to other species of bivalve, it displays rapid suspension feeding, which may cause mortality of pelagic invertebrate larvae. We compared the effect on settlement of Sydney rock oyster, Saccostrea glomerata, larvae of manipulating the spatial arrangement and density of native S. glomerata, and non-native C. gigas. We hypothesized that while manipulations of dead oysters would reveal the same positive relationship between attachment surface area and S. glomerata settlement between the two species, manipulations of live oysters would reveal differing density-dependent effects between the native and non-native <b>oyster.</b> In the <b>field,</b> whether <b>oysters</b> were live or dead, more larvae settled on C. gigas than S. glomerata when substrate was arranged in monospecific clumps. When, however, the two species were interspersed, there were no differences in larval settlement between them. By contrast, in aquaria simulating a higher effective oyster density, more larvae settled on live S. glomerata than C. gigas. When C. gigas was prevented from suspension feeding, settlement of larvae on C. gigas was enhanced. By contrast, settlement was similar between the two species when dead. While the presently low densities of the invasive oyster C. gigas may enhance S. glomerata larval settlement in east Australian estuaries, future increases in densities could produce negative impacts on native oyster settlement. Synthesis and applications: Our study has shown that both the spatial arrangement and density of invaders can influence their impact. Hence, management strategies aimed at preventing invasive populations reaching damaging sizes should not only consider the threshold density at which impacts exceed some acceptable limit, but also how patch formation modifies this. © 2013 The Authors...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of waste products into rivers and estuaries in industrial and urbanised areas since {{the industrial revolution}} has led to significant increases in chemical contamination. As such, it is now imperative to develop effective monitoring methods to protect biota and the environment. Biomarkers provide information on the cause and effect paradigm of contamination by linking contaminants directly to their effects on biota. However, traditional single parameter biomarker analyses can be insensitive, especially at low contaminant levels. Proteomics provides a new method for identifying potentially hundreds of species specific biomarkers simultaneously at extremely low levels of contamination and over short time periods, allowing early detection of environmental damage. The current study uses proteomics to assess the effects of metal contamination on Sydney Rock oysters. Saccostrea glomerata were exposed for four days to three environmentally relevant concentrations (100 µg/l, 50 µg/l and 5 µg/l) of copper, lead and zinc. Oyster haemolymph from metal-exposed oysters was compared to haemolymph from non-exposed controls by 2 -dimensional electrophoresis to identify differentially expressed proteins. Differential proteins were subsequently characterised using tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) so that their putative biological functions could be assigned. The data {{suggest that there are}} unique protein expression profiles not only for each metal, but at each concentration of metal. Exposure to 100 µg/l of copper, lead and zinc yielded a total of 21 differentially expressed proteins. Only one of these proteins was common to all three metals. Differentially expressed proteins were putatively assigned 11 different biological functions, of which cytoskeletal activity accounted for 25 %. Ongoing work includes testing the efficacy of these potential protein biomarkers in the natural environment using <b>oyster</b> samples from <b>field</b> studies conducted in Lake Macquarie, NSW, Australia. 2 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2011 This {{dissertation}} develops mixed {{family selection}} for Pacific oysters using marker-based pedigree reconstruction. It focuses on improving {{the efficiency of}} parentage assignment, determining the optimum life stage to mix oyster families for rearing and selection, comparing mixed-family and separate-family selective breeding in the field, and applying the mixed method to estimate the heritability of shell shape. We developed novel computer software, P-LOCI (available at [URL] which identifies the most efficient set of codominant markers for assigning parentage, accounting for marker linkage, mating design, null alleles and genotyping error, {{and found that the}} most efficient group of loci for assignment is not necessarily comprised of the top individually ranked loci, or best for all populations. We determined the optimum time to mix oyster families for rearing and selection in the field; overall, planting size is the most prudent time to mix families for MFS, due to high variability in family representation produced during larval and nursery stages. Mixing families at stages earlier than this for selection on field traits would require pre-planting genotyping of large samples for estimation of initial family representation, which would add substantial cost, or other special considerations. Rearing mixed family groups of <b>oysters</b> in the <b>field</b> yielded very similar results to rearing the same families separately, (r = 0. 817 for two-site average individual weight at harvest), demonstrating it is unlikely associative effects are of great importance in the Pacific oyster. Our results show that the mixed method was well-suited for individual traits and walk-back selection, but would incur higher costs than the separate method to estimate survival with lower precision. Finally, we utilized the mixed method to estimate the heritability of shell shape using midparent-offspring regression; we estimated shell depth heritability as 0. 404 ± 0. 14 and shell width as 0. 287 ± 0. 11, nearly equal to the only other study for the Pacific oyster, demonstrating potential for selective breeding on these traits in this U. S. population, and similar results between methods. Overall, we found that mixed-family rearing is viable for Pacific oyster breeding, given some important restrictions...|$|R
40|$|Estuarine acidification, {{caused by}} {{disturbance}} of acid sulfate soils (ASS), is a recurrent problem in eastern Australia. Affected waters are characterised by low pH and elevated concentrations of metals, principally aluminium and iron. The effects of acid and elevated metal concentrations associated with ASS, on adult Sydney rock oysters, {{have not been}} previously investigated. This study tested links between ASS-affected drainage, subsequent estuarine acidification and Sydney rock oyster production problems on the Hastings and Manning Rivers, mid north coast New South Wales. The primary objective of this thesis was to establish if estuarine acidification causes mortality and slow growth in individual Sydney rock oysters by exposing oysters to low pH, iron and aluminium using field and laboratory experiments. Water quality data showed that estuarine acidification was spatially extensive in the Hastings and Manning Rivers following heavy rainfall and was due to mineral acids originating from drained or excavated ASS. Estuarine acidification regularly affected areas used for Sydney rock oyster production following heavy rainfall. Field experiments showed that Sydney rock oyster mortality rates were significantly higher at sites exposed to ASS-affected waters compared to locations that were isolated from ASS-affected waters. Oyster mortality increased with the time of exposure and smaller oysters (mean weight = 5 g) experienced significantly higher mortality relative to larger oysters (mean weight = 29 g). This was caused by acid-induced shell degradation resulting in perforation of the smaller oysters under-developed shells. Additionally, Sydney rock oyster growth rates were dramatically reduced at sites exposed to ASS-affected waters and the overall mean condition index of <b>oysters</b> at ASS-affected <b>field</b> sites was {{significantly lower than the}} overall mean condition index of oysters at non-impacted sites. Findings from laboratory experiments showed that ASS-affected water alters oyster valve movements and significantly reduces oyster feeding rates at pH 5. 5. Acidic treatments (pH 5. 1) containing 7. 64 mg L- 1 of aluminium or ASS-affected water caused changes in the mantle and gill soft tissues following short-term exposure. Degenerative effects described in oysters in this study were also due to iron contained in ASS-affected waters. Iron precipitates accumulated on the shell, gills and mantle and were observed in the stomach, intestine, digestive tubules and rectum. This study concluded that Sydney rock oysters are unable to tolerate acidic conditions caused by ASS outflows and cannot be viably cultivated in acid-prone areas of the estuary...|$|R

Pearl oyster farming is a significant component of the Australian mariculture industry. However, disease often threatens its productivity. Previous work has identified a strong relationship between environmental stress and altered immunological activity in many molluscs, often resulting in the spread of opportunistic pathogens. My studies investigate this relationship, focusing on the effect of stress induced neuroendocrine secretions. [...] The First Chapter provides a general introduction to the history and existing knowledge of Akoya pearl oyster aquaculture. This Chapter examines subjects that are to be further investigated by this thesis, namely; the relationship between farmed marine invertebrates and the influence of husbandry and handling on their immune and endocrine systems. [...] The Second Chapter provides a detailed introduction of the morphology and cytochemistry of P. imbricata haemocytes; granulocytes, hyalinocytes, and serous cells. Granulocytes represent the most abundant cells type (62 %), and are shown to have the highest capacity to phagocytose Congo red-stained yeast cells. Granules contained within granulocytes were also found to stain positively for a number of immuno-reactive enzymes or products including; phenoloxidase (PO), peroxidase, superoxide, and melanin. Hyalinocytes were the second most abundant cell type (36 %), and also engulfed Congo red-stained yeast cells. Serous cells represented the smallest component of the haemocyte population (2 %) and were not involved in clearance activities. [...] Chapter Three investigates the effects of common environmental stressors (low salinity, mechanical agitation (MA), and exposure to air) on the immunological activity in P. imbricata haemocytes. Both phagocytosis and PO activity decreased significantly when oysters were exposed to all three stressors. The responses to other parameters tested (granulocyte to hyalinocyte ratio, total haemocyte counts, acid phosphatase activity, and total protein content) were found to vary, and the different immunological parameters tested were influenced uniquely according to the type of stressor. [...] Chapter Four addresses the relationship between stress and hormone-induced apoptosis in defensive haemocytes from P. imbricata. Haemocytes were exposed to 0. 0, 2. 5, 5. 0 and 10. 0 ng noradrenaline (NA) per μg of protein. Both DNA fragmentation and Annexin V-FITC staining was greatest in haemocytes exposed to 10 ng NA/ μg protein. The ability of haemocytes to adhere to glass slides was also negatively affected by NA exposure. Cytoskeletal re-arrangement was evident in NA- treated haemocytes stained with the F-actin selective stain, Phalloidin Alexa Fluor 488. Morphological and ultrastructural changes in NA-exposed haemocytes identified by transmission and scanning electron microscopy included; chromatin and cytoplasmic condensation, the formation of apoptotic bodies, vacuolization and blebbing. Husbandry and handling are often the cause of, or exacerbate, stress in farmed marine species. Chapter Five explores this relationship by investigating the effects of antifouling practices (treatment with high pressure water jets, being struck with a chisel, a combination of the high pressure water jets and being struck with a chisel and exposure to air) on mature pearl <b>oysters</b> in the <b>field</b> (P. maxima). We also investigated the effects of air exposure on juvenile oysters. Phenoloxidase activity declined by >/= 40 % after 48 h exposure in all mature treated oysters. After 96 h, PO activity recovered to greater than control values. Comparatively, PO activity increased significantly in juvenile oysters exposed to air at both 24 and 96 h. [...] The Sixth Chapter investigates the effects of MA and exposure to air on the expression of antioxidant genes in P. imbricata. Significant declines in the expression of glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and peroxiredoxin (PRx) were recorded after 60 min exposure to both MA and exposure to air. Similarly, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) expression declined significantly after 60 min exposure to MA. Hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling indicated that the suppression of antioxidant expression was transient and had begun to return to control (unperturbed) levels within 6 hours. The MDS analysis also showed there to be no difference between the MA and air treatments, suggesting that air (the common component of both treatments) was the causative agent of stress. Given that the expression of HSP- 70, a common marker of 'stress', was not significantly affected when oysters were exposed to MA and air, monitoring antioxidant genes in pearl oysters may represent a more informative suit of biomarkers in response to husbandry and handling stressors. [...] Chapter Seven reviews the effects of environmental stress and the spread of disease in P. fucata (also known as P. imbricata throughout Australia), referring to experiences with related species. It provides a comprehensive and detailed summary of factors implicated with disease genesis and on-going outbreaks. [...] Overall, the data presented in this thesis demonstrates a strong association between environmental stress and immunological suppression.
