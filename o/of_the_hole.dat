5|$|Attempts by law {{enforcement}} to investigate conditions at Gold Base have been blocked by legal difficulties and the unwillingness {{of those on the}} base to talk to the police. According to Lawrence Wright, who wrote an account <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hole</b> in his 2013 book , the Riverside County sheriff's office has never received a complaint from someone at the base about their treatment there, despite the many accounts of mistreatment. Wright attributes this to the fear that many Scientologists have of bringing shame upon Scientology and of being forced to break off contact with their families and friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{treatment}} of choice for this condition is the surgical application of epidural blood patches, which has a higher success rate than conservative treatments of bed rest and hydration. Through the injection of a person's own blood into the area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> in the dura, an epidural blood patch uses blood's clotting factors to clot the sites of holes. The volume of autologous blood and number of patch attempts for patients is highly variable. One-quarter to one-third of SCSFLS patients do not have relief of symptoms from epidural blood patching.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{spiraling}} of {{the tool}} as it cuts, so the form {{at the bottom of}} the workpiece may be rotated with respect to the form at the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> or profile. Spiraling may be undesirable because it binds the body {{of the tool}} and prevents it from cutting sharply. One solution to this is to reverse the rotation in mid cut, causing the tool to spiral in the opposite direction. If reversing the machine is not practical, then interrupting the cut is another possible solution.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> goal <b>of</b> {{this paper}} was to {{describe}} bonding processes between steel and concrete specimens experimentally and by applying analytical and FE methods. <b>The</b> results <b>of</b> investigations on <b>the</b> bonding behavior between lightweight concrete and steel strips enable a better understanding on <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> lightweight concrete in wall panels. The {{results show that the}} experimental, theoretical, and FE simulation results match very well. Three geometrical parameters affecting the pull-out force were also investigated in this paper, namely <b>the</b> total area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes,</b> <b>the</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes,</b> and <b>the</b> circumference area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b> <b>The</b> diameter <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> or circumference area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> was found to give stronger correlation with the pull-out forces; however, weaker correlations exist between the pull-out forces and <b>the</b> total area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>holes.</b> <b>The</b> strips with <b>the</b> greatest <b>hole</b> area, hole diameter, and circumference areas had higher pull-out forces, and the increase is nearly linear.|$|R

5|$|Groups {{are also}} applied {{in many other}} {{mathematical}} areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying {{the properties of the}} corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups. For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point. The fundamental group of the plane with a point deleted turns out to be infinite cyclic, generated by the orange loop (or any other loop winding once around the hole). This way, the fundamental group detects the hole.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} {{the debut of}} the TerrorDome and {{involved}} Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Kaz, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt. Before the match, Management Director Jim Cornette announced that the winner would take Kurt Angle's place in the main event, {{in addition to being}} the TNA X Division Championship number one contender. In this match, the ring was surrounded by a giant red steel barred cage with a domed roof. The wrestlers were to compete as they climbed up the side to a hole {{in the center of the}} ceiling; the first to escape the cage would win. While Devine was attempting to escape, Kaz intervened and caused Devine to fall from the ceiling into a group of wrestlers huddled in the center of the ring. Kaz then climbed out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> to win the contest at ten minutes and forty five seconds.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} larval {{development}} inside the seeds which {{are protected by}} the pods, most inventorying methods are based on population of B. rufimanus adult in the field or at emergence. Adult population density can be estimated by counts on plants at field colonization. The development semiochemical attractants trapping systems for both monitoring and pest control has received particular interest in ongoing research on the weevil. Egg density can be estimated on young developing pods (>2 cm) during the oviposition period. Eggs are however small (<1mm length), green-yellowish, therefore difficult to observe. In addition, population estimate are difficult to obtain as egg laying is spread over time until 5–10 days {{after the end of}} flowering (BBCH 77). After harvest, seed quality can be observed manually at harvest and characterized according to pest damage (healthy, with no trace of damage/containing developing larvae/trace of emerged B. rufimanus adult (a hole in the seed). Alternative methods exist to sort the seeds: sorting can be done using differences in seed density due to the presence of the developing larva or <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> left by the emerged adult, estimation of damages seeds can be done by tomography analysis. Additionally, the end of larval and pupal diapause and therefore the emergence of B. rufimanus can be induced via a solution of NaOCl and chinosol in 7 days at 30 °C, allowing the estimation of an overall infestation rate can be assessed.|$|E

25|$|The {{tip of the}} gimlet bit acts as a tapered screw, to {{draw the}} bit into the wood and to begin forcing aside the wood fibers, without {{necessarily}} cutting them.
