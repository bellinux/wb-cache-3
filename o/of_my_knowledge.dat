500|$|Randy Blythe {{was called}} {{again to the}} stand that day. The judge first alerted {{him that he had}} the right to remain silent and can deny {{answering}} his questions. The judge went again through the Blythe's testimony and, with a view to the previous witness statements, asked Blythe whether he insists that it was Milan Pořádek whom Blythe threw off the stage. Blythe responded by saying: [...] "To the best <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge,</b> it was Milan Pořádek who was coming up [...] every time." ...|$|E
500|$|Not {{long after}} the mural's completion, New Seasons Market {{announced}} {{plans to build a}} new store immediately adjacent to the mural. In January 2014, the co-owner of Red Fox Vintage, said, [...] "We're going to have a sit-down with New Seasons about the mural. To the best <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge,</b> New Seasons will make it right." [...] She shared three options to discuss with the company: repainting the mural on Red Fox's east wall, transferring it to the new store's exterior wall, or keeping the original mural in place and making it visible from the grocery store's interior.|$|E

2500|$|Under the new {{whistleblower}} program, the SEC {{is authorized}} to make monetary awards to whistleblower who voluntarily provide original information {{that leads to}} successful enforcement actions resulting in monetary sanctions over $1,000,000. Under the program, a whistleblower may receive an award of between 10 to 30 percent of the monetary sanctions collected. The SEC's new whistleblower program also allows whistleblower to submit anonymous complaints if represented by an attorney. This represents a major benefit over other whistleblower reward programs that do not allow anonymous submissions, such as the IRS whistleblower program. Anonymous whistleblowers must sign a declaration in their complaint under the penalty of perjury [...] "that the information contained herein is true, correct and complete to the best <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge,</b> information and belief." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Haigh, a {{historian}} {{of information technology}} at the University of Wisconsin, wrote that [...] "Ayyadurai is, to the best <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge,</b> {{the only person to}} have claimed for him or herself the title 'inventor of email'." [...] Haigh argued that while EMAIL was impressive for a teenager's work, it contained no features that were not present on previous electronic mail systems and had no obvious influence on later systems. [...] "The most striking thing about Ayyadurai's claim to have invented electronic mail is how late it comes. Somehow it took him thirty years to alert the world to [...] greatest achievement". Haigh wrote that by 1980, [...] "electronic mail had been in use at MIT for 15 years, Xerox had built a modern, mouse-driven graphical email system for office communication, Compuserve was selling email access to the public, and email had for many years been the most popular application on what was soon to become the Internet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before the {{purchase}} by the Northern Pacific of the stock, the Lake Shore, finding {{it impossible to}} provide adequate terminal facilities at Spokane from the proceeds of [...] main line bonds, organized a company under {{the title of the}} Spokane Union Depot Company, to which the Washington and Idaho Railroad (a branch of the Union Pacific System), were admitted to half ownership. Bonds were issued amounting to a little over $400,000. The stock issue of $500,000 was divided equally between the two companies. The Lake Shore was reimbursed for the work on that portion of their main line within the limits of the depot grounds from the proceeds of the depot bonds, but to the best <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>knowledge</b> and belief, the railway bonds were never cancelled. This property I have nominally estimated at $600,000 ... but its real value is probably at least $1,000,000. It is used by the Oregon Railway and Navigation [...] and the Great Northern systems, and these companies would have to expend at least $1,000,000 to provide equivalent facilities of less actual value. I have made repeated efforts for several years past to have this matter investigated, but owing to the circumstances have thus far been unsuccessful. If this depot stock does not come under the line of the Lake Shore bonds, it could doubtless be attached to satisfy some claims of the Northern Pacific against the Lake Shore.|$|E
