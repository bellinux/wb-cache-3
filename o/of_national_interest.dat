Since 1998, the general and bulk cargo operations of the port have been operated by Luka Ploče d.d. and development has resumed. In 2009, after negotiations with the Port of Ploče Authority, Luka Ploče was granted a 32-year extension of the concession contract for the cargo handling operations of the port. The contract requires the port authority to improve port infrastructure and Luka Ploče to invest in new cargo handling equipment. The Croatian government considers the Port of Ploče {{to be one of}} six seaports <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>interest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Along with {{intellectual}} pursuits, the gentry exhibited {{habits and}} cultured hobbies which marked their social status and refinement. The erudite term of enjoying {{the company of}} the 'nine guests' (九客, jiuke)—an extension of the Four Arts of the Chinese Scholar—was a metaphor for accepted gentry pastimes of playing the Chinese zither, playing Chinese chess, Zen Buddhist meditation, ink (calligraphy and painting), tea drinking, alchemy, chanting poetry, conversation, and drinking wine. The painted artwork of the gentry shifted dramatically in style from Northern to Southern Song, due to underlying political, demographic, and social circumstance. Northern Song gentry and officials, who were concerned largely with tackling issues <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> and not much for local affairs, preferred painting huge landscape scenes where any individuals were but tiny figures immersed within a larger context. During the Southern Song, political, familial, and social concerns became heavily embedded with localized interests; these changes correlate with the chief style of Southern Song paintings, where small, intimate scenes with a primary focus on individuals was emphasized.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} legal instruments {{for the promotion}} of renewable energy are Law 25,019 from 1998 and Law 26,190 from 2007. The 1998 law, known as the “National Wind and Solar Energy Rules”, declared wind and solar generation <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> and introduced a mechanism that established an additional payment per generated kWh which, in 1998, meant a 40% premium over market price. It also granted certain tax exemptions for a period of 15 years from the law's promulgation. The 2007 Law complemented the previous one, declaring <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> the generation of electricity from any renewable source intended to deliver a public service. This law also set an 8% target for renewable energy consumption in the period of 10 years and mandated the creation of a trust fund whose resources will be allocated to pay a premium for electricity produced from renewable sources.|$|E

25|$|After {{more than}} a decade of steady losses, the magazine's {{fortunes}} finally turned around in the 1960s when Andre Laguerre became its managing editor. A European correspondent for Time, Inc., who later became chief of the Time-Life news bureaus in Paris and London (for a time he ran both simultaneously), Laguerre attracted Henry Luce's attention in 1956 with his singular coverage of the Winter Olympic Games in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, which became the core of SIs coverage of those games. In May 1956, Luce brought Laguerre to New York to become assistant managing editor of the magazine. He was named managing editor in 1960, and he more than doubled the circulation by instituting a system of departmental editors, redesigning the internal format, and inaugurating the unprecedented use in a news magazine of full-color photographic coverage of the week's sports events. He was also one of the first to sense the rise <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> in professional football.|$|E
25|$|When {{conscription}} {{was introduced}} in Britain on 2 March 1916, Eddington intended to apply for an exemption as a conscientious objector. Cambridge University authorities instead requested and were granted an exemption on the ground of Eddington's work being <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>interest.</b> In 1918, this was appealed against by the Ministry of National Service. Before the appeal tribunal in June, Eddington claimed conscientious objector status, which was not recognized and would have ended his exemption in August 1918. A further two hearings took place in June and July, respectively. Eddington's personal statement at the June hearing about his objection to war based on religious grounds is on record. Astronomer Royal, Sir Frank Dyson, supported Eddington at the July hearing with a written statement, emphasising Eddington's essential role in the solar eclipse expedition to Principe in May 1919. Eddington made clear his willingness {{to serve in the}} Friends' Ambulance Unit, the Red Cross, or as a harvest labourer. However, the tribunal's decision to grant a further twelve months exemption from military service was on condition of Eddington continuing his astronomy work, in particular in preparation for the Principe expedition. The war ended before the end of his exemption.|$|E

25|$|Melbourne Victory– The long-standing {{historical}} contempt held by many Western Australians {{toward their}} eastern state neighbours, {{as well as}} a scorn for anything Victorian has culminated in an especial rivalry with the Melbourne Victory Football Club. The distaste felt by many Glory fans toward the Victorians can largely be put down to the greater bitterness felt by Western Australians toward the Eastern states in regard to matters of politics, culture and indeed other sports, especially Australian Rules Football. Western Australian's often perceive their state to be 'forgotten' in matters <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>interest,</b> {{largely as a result of}} the state being such a distance from the main population and political centres of the country; a factor which can also be said to result in Western Australians being some of the more parochial people in Australia. This hatred of the eastern states can be said to focus upon Melbourne Victory in the A League as Victory are the biggest and most successful club on the Eastern seaboard. Another reason for the hate towards Melbourne Victory is due to Besart Berisha, who was awarded a controversial penalty in the dying minutes of the 2012 Grand Final.|$|E
25|$|Upon a great {{inventory}} of {{the environment of the}} county {{in the middle of the}} 1960s, Skuleskogen was noticed for its great natural value. So, in 1968, it was decided to protect a part of the massif. In 1971, the management plan for the territories of Sweden resulted in the High Coast being classified as a zone <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>interest,</b> and next in 1974, a part of the zone was classified as a temporary nature reserve. However, conflict arose between the land owners and the authorities of nature protection, the latter maintaining that no exploitation of the forest could occur and that the zone ought to be classified as a national park. To accomplish this the terrain would have had to be purchased by the state, but the land owners did not accept the deal that they would be given equivalent areas of forest nearby. However, the NCB company, which owned about 70% of the land, was in great financial difficulty and had to sell its land; the state was therefore able to buy the lands inside the proposed park, as well as some surrounding land, to compensate the other land owners. The county therefore proposed in 1978 the creation of a natural park to Naturvårdsverket which transmitted the proposal the following year to the government. The decision was not, however, made, because some parts of the proposed park were still privately owned. The zone was classified as a result only as a nature reserve in 1979.|$|E
25|$|The decades between 1780 and 1830 feature several {{characteristics}} at Râmnic. The {{traditions of}} spiritual, cultural and artistic life were continued, with war-damaged churches repaired and new ones {{built in a}} manner that balanced a post-Brâncovenesc style with folk art innovations. The monasteries and the diocesan center continued to educate calligraphers, copyists, miniaturists, painters and musicians. The diocesan printing press was continued, albeit with difficulties and interruptions. Bishop Filaret, after being elected metropolitan, took the printing instruments with him to use at Bucharest. His successor Nectarie rebuilt the press, turning out twenty books, including a collection of sermons in Bulgarian for that country's believers; he followed as metropolitan in 1812. Galaction (1812-1824) published few books, but these were important, including a re-edited alphabet book in 1814 and a book on the miracles of the Virgin Mary in 1820. Neofit, who took over in 1824, sold the press to a group of laymen. (The current press dates to the time of Bishop Vartolomeu (1920-1938).) Bishop Calinic (1850-1868), whose reign coincided with the formation of the modern Romanian state, was the diocese's pre-eminent leader during the 19th century; his successors did not rise to the same spiritual level and were privy to the definitive imposition of government authority upon the church. Calinic set up his own press and published a number of liturgical and spiritual books, including a lamentation in verse, a collection of advice for monks and a chronicle on the Wallachian uprising of 1821. He also disseminated word of the government order replacing Greek with Romanian for liturgical use. Finally, local writers began to look beyond the confines of the diocese, dealing with themes <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>interest</b> and making themselves known in the Romanian cultural and literary scene of the day.|$|E
40|$|Within {{the debate}} on {{international}} relations an increasing amount of scholars have acknowledged that the debate is unnecessarily entrenched in old paradigms and that the dividing lines are in many cases arbitrary. This theory-developing paper is {{an answer to the}} call for cross-fertilization specifically between realism and constructivism. Here the concept <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>interests,</b> and its role in the realist tradition of international relations, is re-examined. The argument is made that, classical- and neo-classical-, realist theories should take identity into account when explaining states pursuit <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>interests.</b> This is done not only by identifying and explaining the constructivist theories that is useful to realism but also by illuminating an, so far, unexplored potential within realism to directly include identity into its theories.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research <b>of</b> connection between <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> and the security policy of the European Union is to perceive the possibilities of the Balkan states to preserve their identity and achieve their vital and permanent <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> by their membership in the European Union. According to the author, {{the implementation of the}} security policy of European Union is often opposite to one’s own <b>national</b> <b>interests.</b> However, a pragmatic question for political leaders is how to resolve the following dilemma: „is the created european security identity more important at the moment than the preservation of immediate or some permanent national interests“? The author points {{to the fact that the}} notion <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> is a variable both historically and theoretically. Political, economic, security and other objectives determine vital <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> in some historical periods. At the same time, not rarely, some states alter their strategies and objectives for their own interests assessing whether the conditions prevailing in the internal and external surroundings have changed. The author devotes special attention to a comparative analysis of defining, determining and conceptual determination <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> from the aspect <b>of</b> <b>national</b> security policies <b>of</b> some important states and the European Union. The second part of the article contains an analysis of the response of a group of Macedonian experts to the questions pertaining to the possibility of preserving and achieving <b>of</b> <b>national</b> <b>interests</b> <b>of</b> the Republic of Macedonia through its membership in the European Union...|$|R

The stated reason for this was that it was only after the purchase had been made that Kraft realised how advanced Cadbury's plans were, but industry experts questioned this, arguing that Kraft invested so much in researching their bid for Cadbury that they should have been aware {{of the extent to which}} plans had been advanced.|$|E
