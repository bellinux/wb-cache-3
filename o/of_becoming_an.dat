40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine what effect social {{background}} may have on the timing <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> parent in Sweden. By applying event-history techniques to data from the Swedish level of living survey (LNU) we try to separate the direct from the indirect effect of social background on timing of first childbearing. Few previous studies have focused on characteristics of social background and analysis of intergenerational effects on the age <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> parent. In this study, we show that the risk <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> parent is different for those who are mobile than for the socially non-mobile. The effect of social background on the propensity <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> parent is not just indirect via persons own educational careers. When we control for own educational level much of the impact of social background on the propensity <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>a</b> parent remains. We clearly show the existence of a significant direct effect of social background on the propensity to become a parent...|$|R

5|$|West Virginia {{has often}} been called Maryland's biggest rival, and the teams have met 51 times since their first game in 1919. The Maryland-West Virginia rivalry had a chance <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>an</b> annual game with West Virginia {{potentially}} joining the ACC in 2012, but the Mountaineers wound up joining the Big 12 Conference. In 2001, both programs hired new head coaches, with West Virginia being taken over by Rich Rodriguez. Due to their proximity, the schools regularly raid their opponent's recruiting areas. The long-running series was put on hiatus for the 2008 and 2009 seasons, but resumed in 2010.|$|E
5|$|A report {{had been}} {{prepared}} for the parish council in 1903 which noted the population in Northwood – 2,700 by that time, with 530 houses – compared with the largely rural character {{of the rest of}} Ruislip parish. At a meeting of the Ruislip parish council on 28 October 1903, the forthcoming extension of the Metropolitan Railway from Harrow on the Hill to Uxbridge was also discussed as it was known that a station would be opened in Ruislip on the new line. Councillors were also aware that King's College, Cambridge, owners of much of the land in the parish and lords of the manor, were planning to sell some for development. With this in mind, a vote was cast which went in favour <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>an</b> urban district. The new district was designed to better reflect to increase in development, as councillors felt a parish council would work slower than an urban district.|$|E

Time conflicts with bishopric meetings would have made Navy service impossible. After discussion with church apostle Harold B. Lee (his former stake president), Monson declined the commission and applied for a discharge. The Navy granted his discharge in the last group processed before the Korean War. Lee set him apart six months later as a bishop—mentioning in the blessing that he likely would not have been called if he had accepted the commission.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Liverpool, {{he was put}} in charge of the Clarendon Furnishing shop in Hoylake and was made a director of NEMS in 1955. In September 1956, he took a trip to London to meet a friend but after being there for only one day, was robbed of his passport, birth certificate, chequebook, wristwatch, and all the money he had on him. He did not want his parents to find out, so he worked as a department store clerk until he had earned enough money to buy a train ticket back to Liverpool. Back in Liverpool, he confessed his homosexuality to a psychiatrist—a friend of the Epstein family—who suggested to Harry Epstein that his son should leave Liverpool as soon as possible. During the sessions, Epstein revealed his ambition <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> <b>an</b> actor, so his parents allowed him go to London to study.|$|E
5|$|An urban {{district}} council {{had been considered}} a year previously, {{in light of the}} expansion of areas within the parish, particularly Northwood.
