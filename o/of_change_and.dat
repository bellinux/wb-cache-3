5|$|Paleoclimatology is {{the study}} of past climate over a great period of the Earth's history. It uses {{evidence}} from ice sheets, tree rings, sediments, coral, and rocks to determine the past state of the climate. It demonstrates periods of stability and periods <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>and</b> can indicate whether changes follow patterns such as regular cycles.|$|E
5|$|On October 16, 1978, the Bishop of Kraków, Karol Wojtyła, {{was elected}} Pope John Paul II. A year later, {{during his first}} pilgrimage to Poland, his masses were {{attended}} by {{hundreds of thousands of}} his countrymen. The Pope called for the respecting of national and religious traditions and advocated for freedom and human rights, while denouncing violence. To many Poles, he represented a spiritual and moral force that could be set against brute material forces, he was a bellwether <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> <b>and</b> became an important symbol—and supporter—of changes to come.|$|E

5|$|Models are {{initialized}} {{using this}} observed data. The irregularly spaced observations are processed by data assimilation and objective analysis methods, which perform quality control and obtain values at locations usable by the model's mathematical algorithms (usually an evenly spaced grid). The data are then {{used in the}} model {{as the starting point}} for a forecast. Commonly, the set of equations used to predict the known as the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere are called primitive equations. These equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined. The rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future. The equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> <b>and</b> these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future. This time stepping procedure is continually repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time. The length of the time step is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid.|$|E
5|$|The {{early part}} of the story {{provides}} an anthropological view of the culture of the Tombs, and through them, of the Kargish lands as a whole. The reader is shown that the true names of people have no particular significance in the Kargish lands, whereas in the Archipelago they grant power over the thing being named; nonetheless, the critical moment in which Tenar recalls her true name has been described as influencing other works such as Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film Spirited Away. Scholars have described Le Guin's depiction of Kargish culture as a subtle critique, particularly of the powers of the Tombs, which give nothing in return for their worship. Much of the {{early part of}} the novel describes the life that Tenar leads in the stable world of the Tombs. Ged's arrival acts as a turning point, and the rest of the book explores the possibility <b>of</b> <b>change,</b> <b>and</b> introduces different perspectives on the internal world of the novel.|$|E

25|$|A {{differential}} equation is a mathematical equation that relates some function with its derivatives.

25|$|The {{length of}} each period is {{determined}} by the rate <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>and</b> the required change in gain. For more intuitive operation, a compressor's attack and release controls are labeled as a unit of time (often milliseconds). This is the amount of time it takes for the gain to change a set amount of dB, decided by the manufacturer—often 10dB. For example, if the compressor's time constants are referenced to 10dB, and the attack time is set to 1ms, it takes 1ms for the gain to decrease by 10dB, and 2ms to decrease by 20dB.|$|E
25|$|In the main, {{experience}} in the introduction of wholesale and retail competition has been mixed.

However, in 2000/2001 major failures such as the California electricity crisis and the Enron debacle caused a slow down in the pace <b>of</b> <b>change</b> <b>and</b> in some regions an increase in market regulation and reduction in competition. However, this trend {{is widely regarded as}} a temporary one against the longer term trend towards more open and competitive markets.|$|E
