25|$|The group's surf {{music was}} not entirely of their own invention, being preceded by artists such as Dick Dale. However, {{previous}} surf musicians did not project a world view as the Beach Boys did. Their early hits helped raise the profile <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>California,</b> creating its first major regional style with national significance, and establishing a musical identity for Southern California, as opposed to Hollywood. This also associated the band with surfing, hot-rod racing, and a contemporaneous teenage lifestyle and fantasy. The California Sound gradually evolved to reflect a more musically ambitious and mature world view, becoming {{less to do with}} surfing and cars and more about social consciousness and political awareness. Between 1964 and 1969, it fueled innovation and transition, inspiring artists to tackle largely unmentioned themes such as sexual freedom, black pride, drugs, oppositional politics, other countercultural motifs, and war.|$|E

The news stories also reported that Genie's mother died of unspecified natural causes at the age of 87 and featured an interview with Genie's brother, who was living in Ohio, which was the only time he publicly spoke about his or Genie's lives; he told reporters that since leaving the Los Angeles area he had visited Genie and their mother only once, in 1982, and had refused to watch or read anything about Genie's life until just prior to the interview, but said he had recently heard Genie was doing well. A story by journalist Rory Carroll in The Guardian, published in July 2016, stated that Genie still lived in state care and that her brother died in 2011, and said that despite repeated efforts Susan Curtiss had been unable to renew contact with Genie.|$|E
