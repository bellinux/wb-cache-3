5|$|Aberdeen {{joint station}} was congested, {{resulting}} in delayed trains, and the low, open platforms were frequently covered in <b>oily</b> <b>slime</b> {{due to the}} large quantities of fish that passed through. Agreement with the Caledonian Railway over rebuilding the station had been reached in 1899, but the companies fell out over widening the line to the south. Moving the goods station to the east was similarly complex, with conflicts with the harbour commissioners and the town council. In 1908 new platforms {{on the western side}} opened and the adjoining station hotel was bought in 1910. Foundations for the new building were laid in 1913 and the station was largely complete by July 1914, although outbreak of war delayed further progress and the station was finally completed in 1920.|$|E

Then, still {{some distance from the}} river, he fell upon his face, and did not rise again. I saw his arms beating feebler and feebler as he sank till at last the <b>oily</b> <b>slime</b> closed over him, and I could detect nothing but a faint heaving underneath the mud. And after a time even that ceased.|$|E
