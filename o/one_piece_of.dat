5|$|The East Midwood Jewish Center building's {{architect}} is uncertain. The {{design is}} officially credited to the Building Committee and Irving Warshaw, the construction superintendent. The architect's {{name is not}} recorded in synagogue records, nor on the building's dedicatory plaque. The Center's National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nomination form, however, argues that the architect was Louis Abramson, based on visual evidence and <b>one</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> written evidence.|$|E

5|$|After {{hearing the}} news that the United States had {{informed}} Britain it would be ending its obligations under the Treaty of 1818 and looking for a division of the Oregon Country, the legislature scaled back its agenda. <b>One</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> legislation passed was a pilotage law that set standards and licensed boat pilots {{at the mouth of the}} Columbia River. The 1846 legislature met in the home of Henry Montgomery Knighton in Oregon City from December 1 through 19, with Asa Lovejoy serving as the speaker and leader. Noah Huber served as a clerk and Knighton as sergeant at arms.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano {{headed north}} with nearly two hundred men, expecting to gather more {{people by the}} end of the Paraná River. Soldiers from the Blandengues regiments of San Nicolás and Santa Fe joined them en route, and later the Junta sent {{reinforcements}} of another two hundred soldiers. The army was welcomed by most of the population along the way, receiving donations and new recruits. Ultimately the army was composed of nearly 950 men, consisting of infantry and cavalry divided in four divisions with <b>one</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> artillery each.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{regional}} seismic risk, the nuclear portion of the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant was shut down in the 1970s. No substantial damage occurred to the two fossil-fuel units that were still operational at the facility. Several types of sensors were installed at the site to capture strong motion data in this seismically-active area, {{but the majority of}} records from the event were considered unreliable due to faulty equipment or inadequate maintenance. Only <b>one</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> equipment at the facility provided data by which an estimate of the peak ground acceleration could be made.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with <b>one</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> evidence uncovered by the Inquiry during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise the morning after the crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E

The largest Uranian moons may be internally differentiated, with rocky cores at their centers surrounded by ice mantles. Titania and Oberon may harbor liquid water oceans at the core/mantle boundary. The major moons of Uranus are airless bodies. For instance, Titania was shown to possess no atmosphere at a pressure larger than 10–20nanobar.|$|E

5|$|Any time deep {{focus was}} impossible—as {{in the scene}} in which Kane {{finishes}} a negative review of Susan's opera {{while at the same}} time firing the person who began writing the review—an optical printer was used to make the whole screen appear in focus, visually layering <b>one</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> film onto another. However, some apparently deep-focus shots were the result of in-camera effects, as in the famous scene in which Kane breaks into Susan's room after her suicide attempt. In the background, Kane and another man break into the room, while simultaneously the medicine bottle and a glass with a spoon in it are in closeup in the foreground. The shot was an in-camera matte shot. The foreground was shot first, with the background dark. Then the background was lit, the foreground darkened, the film rewound, and the scene re-shot with the background action.|$|E

5|$|In 2016 Natalee’s father, Dave Holloway, hired {{a private}} investigator, T.J. Ward, {{to go through}} all {{evidence}} and information related to the disappearance once more. This led to an informant named Gabriel, who claims to have been a roommate of one of Van der Sloot's closest friends named John back in 2005. Gabriel claims that John was told what happened to Natalee. Gabriel gave a detailed description of what happened on the night of Natalee’s disappearance {{in an interview with the}} Oxygen television channel, which created a new documentary series on Natalee's disappearance. The interview aired on Saturday, August 19, 2017. Using Gabriel's information, the investigator had found what appeared to be human bones. On October 3, 2017, DNA testing concluded that <b>one</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> bone was human but it did not belong to Natalee.|$|E
5|$|Many {{executives}} at Enron were indicted {{for a variety}} of charges and some were later sentenced to prison. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, was found guilty in a United States District Court of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation which voided its license to audit public companies, effectively closing the business. By the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, the company had lost the majority of its customers and had ceased operating. Enron employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices. As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies. <b>One</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders. The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients.|$|E
5|$|The game's setting {{stemmed from}} the idea of players being able to create and control a group of obedient creatures. The Shapers and the world of Geneforge were the result of Vogel imagining how would a being possess such power and how would they use it. The game's setting, a mixture of science fiction and fantasy, differs from the pure science fiction setting the game had been envisioned as. Vogel had {{difficulties}} balancing gameplay with the powerful directed-energy weapons players would expect to use in a science fiction game. Sales exceeded the developer's expectations, despite fears that the departure from Spiderweb's Avernum series would deter players. Geneforge received a positive reception from reviewers, despite the quality of the graphics being rated as poor and the game containing <b>one</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> music, the title theme. The plot and setting were praised by reviewers for uniqueness and detail.|$|E

When Gao discovers that Wei {{does not have a}} high school education and has no special talents, he instructs her to teach by copying his texts onto the board and then making the students copy them into their notebooks; he also tells her not to use more than <b>one</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> chalk per day, because the village is too poor to afford more. Before leaving, he explains to her that many students have recently left school to find work in the cities, and he offers her a 10 yuan bonus if all the students are still there when he returns.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Commonwealth Military Forces {{came into}} being on 1 March 1901 and all the colonial forces—{{including}} those still in South Africa—became {{part of the new}} force. 28,923 colonial soldiers, including 1,457 professional soldiers, 18,603 paid militia and 8,863 unpaid volunteers, were subsequently transferred. The individual units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts until the Defence Act 1903 brought all the units under <b>one</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> legislation. This Act also prevented the raising of standing infantry units and specified that militia forces could not be used in industrial disputes or serve outside Australia. However, the majority of soldiers remained in militia units, known as the Citizen Military Forces (CMF). Major General Sir Edward Hutton—a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces—subsequently became the first commander of the Commonwealth Military Forces on 26 December and set to work devising an integrated structure for the new army. In 1911, following a report by Lord Kitchener the Royal Military College, Duntroon was established, as was a system of universal National Service.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth of Australia {{was founded}} on 1 January 1901. On 1 March, 29,010 colonial soldiers, {{consisting}} of 1,544 professional soldiers, 16,105 paid militia and 11,361 unpaid volunteers, were transferred to the new Australian Army. However, the units continued to be administered under the various colonial Acts. Major General Sir Edward Hutton, a former commander of the New South Wales Military Forces, was appointed as the first commander of the Commonwealth Forces, assuming command in early 1902 with Army Headquarters subsequently formed at Victoria Barracks in Melbourne. The Defence Act 1903 brought all of the state units under <b>one</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> legislation; although more significantly, it prevented the raising of standing infantry units, only allowing the establishment of permanent administrative and instructional staff for headquarters, garrison artillery, fortress engineers, submarine mining engineers, and service, medical and ordnance units. It also stipulated that the force could only be maintained by voluntary enlistment {{and that it could}} not serve outside Australia. In this it effectively established the pre-eminence of the Citizen Forces, ensuring that the Australian Army would primarily consist of part-time militia and volunteer forces, which would be supported by a small permanent force limited to filling staff, training and garrison roles. It equally ensured that any force sent overseas could only be done so on a voluntary basis.|$|E
