5|$|Falco is {{summoned to}} Hunsecker's {{penthouse}} apartment, {{only to find}} Susan there by herself and about to attempt suicide. He grabs her just as her brother walks in, but Hunsecker, encouraged by Susan's silence, accuses Falco of trying to assault Susan and begins beating the physically weaker Falco. Falco pleads that he only came to the apartment at Hunsecker's request, prompting Hunsecker to tell Falco that he never called him. As Susan stops Hunsecker from further harming him, Falco realizes that Susan placed the call in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the men to blows.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 2015, it was {{announced}} by Grimsby Town director John Fenty that a financial backer had offered the club to pay his full wages in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> Evans to the Conference Premier club. Having held a board meeting along with team manager Paul Hurst {{it was decided that}} the move would be of too high risk for the club. Grimsby had previously employed Clayton McDonald, the fellow footballer and friend of Evans who was acquitted in the same case, during the 2013–14 season.|$|E
5|$|The Moat Studios in London {{recorded}} Nebulous in stereo, {{with each}} half-hour episode typically taking {{one day to}} record, including read-through and rehearsal. Nicholas Briggs produced the sound, {{using a combination of}} synthesised effects from a Roland SH-101 and foley sound effects. Briggs also carried out the studio editing in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the 30-minute episodes down to the 28 minutes mandated by the BBC to allow time for radio trailers between programmes.|$|E

At the same time, he patronized a number of Shia scholars such as al-Mufid, and sponsored the renovation {{of a number of}} important Shia shrines.|$|E

Four young orphans under the care of Topapa, the village elder, explore the earthquake's impact and come across a crystal of light. The crystal grants them a portion of its power, and instructs them to go forth and restore balance to the world. Not knowing what to make of the crystal's pronouncements, but nonetheless recognizing the importance of its words, the four inform their adoptive family of their mission and set out to explore an overworld outside the area in which they were brought up, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> balance back to the world.|$|E

5|$|In January 1941, {{with the}} threat of {{invasion}} of England reduced, it was decided to send the 2nd AIF units there to the Middle East and the battalion arrived in Egypt in March 1941. Following this the battalion moved to Palestine where it undertook further training and received a draft of reinforcements which enabled it to raise a fourth company in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> it up to establishment. Having been transferred to the 7th Division, the battalion took up defensive positions around Mersa Matruh before taking part in the Syria-Lebanon campaign, during which it took part in several battles.|$|E
5|$|Knox's {{death was}} barely noticed at the time. Although his funeral was {{attended}} by the nobles of Scotland, no major politician or diplomat mentioned his death in their letters that survive. Mary, Queen of Scots made only two brief references to him in her letters. However, what the rulers feared were Knox's ideas more than Knox himself. He was a ruthless and successful revolutionary {{and it was this}} revolutionary philosophy that had a great impact on the English Puritans. Despite his strictness and dogmatism, he has also been described by partisans as contributing to the struggle for genuine human freedom, by teaching a duty to oppose unjust government in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about moral and spiritual change.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August 1917, Downes became Deputy Director of Medical Services (DDMS) of the Desert Mounted Corps, {{while still}} {{retaining}} {{the post of}} ADMS AIF Egypt. He was therefore answerable to three superiors—to Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel, {{the commander of the}} Desert Mounted Corps and AIF Egypt; to Major General Neville Howse, the DMS AIF in London; and to the new British DMS EEF, Major General William Travers Swan. As the EEF advanced into Palestine, the major medical problem remained transportation. During the operations in the Es Salt area, Downes experimented with the delivery of drugs and medical supplies by air. In the Jordan valley in 1918, however, Downes was confronted with an epidemic of malaria and vigorous preventative and prophylactic efforts were required in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> it under control.|$|E

5|$|These {{and other}} major changes brought about major defections among ministers and members, which in turn contributed to a further drop in church revenue. In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the {{finances}} in order, {{major changes in the}} church infrastructure were implemented. The World Tomorrow, which had seen record numbers of viewers {{in the early years of}} the Tkach administration, was stopped. The Plain Truth publication runs were reduced. Staff at the church headquarters were laid off. The famous, church-subsidized Ambassador Auditorium concert series was canceled and offers were sought for the purchase of the Ambassador College Pasadena campus.|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was challenged}} by David Carpenter two years later, in 1985. Montfort {{had no intention}} to compromise with the royalists at all, according to Carpenter. In Carpenter's version of events, the Mise of Lewes was written while the battle was still ongoing, not after the battle was over, as previously assumed. This put Montfort {{in a situation where}} concessions were necessary, in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> hostilities to a halt as soon as possible. Once the battle was over and government in Montfort's hands, he had no longer any interest in reaching a compromise with the royalists, and that was why hostilities continued. This dating of the document, however, has later been disputed by D. W. Burton, who maintains that the document was in fact signed after the battle was concluded.|$|E
5|$|When questioned, Patrick Darby {{testified that}} in 1824, Beauchamp had {{solicited}} his services in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> suit against Sharp for unspecified charges. During their ensuing conversations, Beauchamp had related {{the story of}} Sharp's abandonment of Anna Cooke and her child, swearing that he would kill him one day, {{even if he had}} to come to Frankfort and shoot him down in the street. The combined testimonies of Eliza Sharp and Patrick Darby were sufficient to persuade the city magistrates to hold Beauchamp for trial during the circuit court's next term, which began in March 1826.|$|E

5|$|Before {{the seventh}} season aired, Duchovny {{filed a lawsuit}} against 20th Century Fox. He was upset because, he claimed, Fox had undersold the rights to its own affiliates, thereby costing him huge sums of money. Eventually, the lawsuit was settled, and Duchovny was awarded a {{settlement}} of about $20 million. The lawsuit put strain on Duchovny's professional relationships. Neither Carter nor Duchovny was contracted to work on the series beyond the seventh season; however, Fox entered into negotiations near the end of that season in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the two on board for an eighth season. After settling his contract dispute, Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the seventh season. This contributed to uncertainties over the likelihood of an eighth season. Carter and most fans felt the show was at its natural endpoint with Duchovny's departure, but it was decided that Mulder would be abducted {{at the end of the}} seventh seasons and would return in 12 episodes the following year. The producers then announced that a new character, John Doggett, would fill Mulder's role.|$|E
5|$|Compton and Evans {{continued}} {{to resist the}} Australians on the final morning, the latter being the more aggressive, and proceedings were briefly interrupted by rain less than 30 minutes {{after the start of}} play. At the time, it appeared the downpour might cause the match to end in a draw. After half an hour of stoppages, play resumed and Evans attacked, hitting two fours in quick succession. England's wicket-keeper played Johnston and Johnson confidently, but Bradman nevertheless persisted in giving Compton easy singles in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> Evans on strike so he could be targeted. For his part, Compton thought his partner could be relied upon and accepted the runs gifted to him by the Australian captain, while Evans {{continued to}} attack the bowling. The batsmen appealed against the light after the first stoppage of the day, but were turned down. Australia took the new ball, but the home team's batsmen continued to proceed steadily, Evans being particularly aggressive. After a second interruption for poor light, this time for ten minutes, play resumed, and England had added a further 60 runs to their overnight total to reach 405/6.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the landing}} at Nadzab, General Sir Thomas Blamey, the Allied Land Forces commander, {{intended}} to exploit his success with an advance {{into the upper}} Markham Valley, which would protect Nadzab from Japanese ground attack, {{and serve as a}} jumping off point for an overland advance into the Ramu Valley to capture airfield sites there. On 16 September 1943—the same day that Lae fell—Lieutenant General Sir Edmund Herring, commander of I Corps, Major General George Alan Vasey, commander of the 7th Division, and Major General Ennis Whitehead, commander of the Advanced Echelon, Fifth Air Force, met at Whitehead's headquarters. Whitehead wanted fighter airstrips established in the Kaiapit area by 1 November 1943 in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> short-range fighters within range of the major Japanese base at Wewak. The 7th Division's mission was to prevent the Japanese at Madang from using the Markham and Ramu valleys to threaten Lae or Nadzab. Vasey and Herring considered both an overland operation to capture Dumpu, and an airborne operation using paratroops of the US Army's 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment. Blamey did not agree with their idea of capturing Dumpu first, insisting that Kaiapit be taken beforehand.|$|E

5|$|Glasgow pursued Leipzig, {{and quickly}} caught up, opening fire by 14:40. After {{about twenty minutes}} of firing, Leipzig was hit; she turned to port to open the range, before turning to {{starboard}} in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> her full broadside into action. In the ensuing action, both ships were hit several times, forcing Glasgow to break off and fall behind the more powerful armored cruisers. Leipzig was battered severely by Cornwall and Kent and set on fire; she nevertheless remained in action and continued to fight. In {{the course of the}} engagement, Leipzig hit Cornwall eighteen times, causing a significant list to port. She fired three torpedoes at the British ships, but failed to score any hits with them. At 19:20, Haun issued the order to scuttle his wrecked ship; the British approached and opened fire on the stricken cruiser at close range, killing large numbers of the crew. The British also destroyed a cutter filled with survivors, killing all of them. Leipzig finally capsized and sank at 21:05, with Haun going down with his ship. Only eighteen men were pulled from the freezing water.|$|E
5|$|Historians are {{now turning}} to local gazetteers of Ming China for clues {{that would show}} {{consistent}} growth in population. Using the gazetteers, Brook estimates that the overall population under the Chenghua Emperor (r. 1464–1487) was roughly 75 million, despite mid-Ming census figures hovering around 62 million. While prefectures across the empire in the mid-Ming period were reporting either a drop in or stagnant population size, local gazetteers reported massive amounts of incoming vagrant workers with not enough good cultivated land for them to till, so that many would become drifters, conmen, or wood-cutters that contributed to deforestation. The Hongzhi and Zhengde emperors lessened the penalties against those who had fled their home region, while the Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) finally had officials register migrants wherever they had moved or fled in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> in more revenues.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Scottish & Newcastle {{claimed that}} John Smith's was {{available}} in 40,000 outlets across the United Kingdom. In 2007, Scottish & Newcastle moved production of John Smith's Cask from Tadcaster to Burtonwood near Warrington, and production of John Smith's Magnet to Camerons Brewery of Hartlepool. In 2008 three limited edition beers were released to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the brewery. In 2010 Heineken discontinued production of cask conditioned John Smith's Magnet, although it remains available in kegs. By 2011, production of John Smith's Cask had moved to Cameron's. As of 2012, John Smith's is the sixth highest selling beer brand in the United Kingdom and the highest selling bitter in the world. From February 2013, John Smith's Extra Smooth and Original were reduced from 3.8 to 3.6% ABV. According to Heineken, the decision was taken in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the product {{in line with the}} strength of its major competitors such as Tetley, Boddingtons and Worthington.|$|E
