5|$|Sources differ about Morgan's {{activities}} in 1666. H. R. Allen, in his biography <b>of</b> <b>Morgan,</b> considers the privateer was the second-in-command to Captain Edward Mansvelt. Mansvelt had been issued {{a letter of}} marque for the invasion of Curaçao, {{although he did not}} attack Willemstad, the main city, either after he decided that it was too well-defended or that there was insufficient plunder. Alternatively, Jan Rogoziński and Stephan Talty, in their histories <b>of</b> <b>Morgan</b> and piracy, record that during the year, Morgan oversaw the Port Royal militia and the defence of Jamaica; Fort Charles at Port Royal was partly constructed under his leadership. It was around this time that Morgan purchased his first plantation on Jamaica.|$|E

5|$|At 9:00am Central Daylight Time (CDT) on September25, the National Hurricane Center {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch for coastal regions of Louisiana east <b>of</b> <b>Morgan</b> City. The following day, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning {{when the storm}} neared landfall. A hurricane watch was also issued for areas between Morgan City and Intracoastal City. When forecasts indicated a landfall east of the state, the hurricane watch was canceled and the hurricane warning amended to a tropical storm warning. By September29, all tropical cyclone warnings and watches were discontinued.|$|E
5|$|Daniel C. Lindley, {{a native}} of Middlebury, Vermont, {{compiled}} a book <b>of</b> <b>Morgan</b> breeding stallions, published in 1857. Colonel Joseph Battell, also a Middlebury, Vermont native, published {{the first volume of}} the Morgan Horse Register in 1894, marking the beginning of a formal breed registry. In 1907, the US Department of Agriculture established the US Morgan Horse Farm in Weybridge, Vermont on land donated by Battell for the purpose of perpetuating and improving the Morgan breed. The breeding program aimed to produce horses that were sound, sturdy, well-mannered, and capable of performing well either under saddle or in harness. In 1951, the Morgan Horse Farm was transferred from the USDA to the Vermont Agricultural College (now the University of Vermont).|$|E
5|$|In 1944 the Seagram Company started {{manufacturing}} the Captain Morgan {{brand of}} rum, {{named after the}} privateer. In 2001 the Captain Morgan brand was sold to Diageo, the multinational drinks company based in London. The name <b>of</b> <b>Morgan</b> has been attached to local sites in the Caribbean, such as Morgan's Bridge, Morgan's Pass and Morgan's Valley in Clarendon, Morgan's Harbour Hotel and Beach Club in Kingston, the Hotel Henry Morgan, located in Roatán, Honduras, the Port Morgan resort located in Haiti and Captain Morgan's Retreat and Vacation Club on Ambergris Caye, Belize.|$|E

5|$|Morgan was {{appointed}} a Knight Bachelor in November 1674 {{and returned to}} Jamaica shortly afterward {{to serve as the}} territory's Lieutenant Governor. He served on the Assembly of Jamaica until 1683 and on three occasions he acted as Governor of Jamaica {{in the absence of the}} post-holder. A memoir published by Alexandre Exquemelin, a former shipmate of Morgan's, accused the privateer of widespread torture and other offences; Morgan brought a libel suit against the book's English publishers and won, although the black picture Exquemelin portrayed <b>of</b> <b>Morgan</b> has affected history's view of the Welshman. He died in Jamaica on 25 August 1688. His life was romanticised after his death and he became the inspiration for pirate-themed works of fiction across a range of genres.|$|E

5|$|On September3, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued gale {{warnings}} and hurricane watches for areas between Lake Charles, Louisiana and {{the mouth of}} the Mississippi. Later that day, they were extended westward to Palacios, Texas and eventually, warnings for areas east <b>of</b> <b>Morgan</b> City, Louisiana were canceled. Due to the unexpected loop taken by Delia, gale warnings were extended as far south as Baffin Bay, Texas. By September6, the NHC discontinued all watches and warnings associated with the storm. Around this time, the National Weather Service issued flood warnings, and warned residents about the possibility of tornadoes forming with the weakening tropical cyclone. In Cameron, Louisiana, an estimated 6,000 residents were evacuated with memories of Hurricane Audrey, a storm that killed 575 in the city, still fresh.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{key points}} {{stressed}} in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. Gawain was written {{around the time of}} the Black Death and Peasants' Revolt, events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture. However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control <b>of</b> <b>Morgan</b> le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.|$|E
5|$|Since its inception, {{the award}} {{has been given}} to 25 actors. Guiding Light has the most {{recipients}} of this award, with a total of seven wins. Chandler Massey and Jonathan Jackson are the actors with the most awards, with a total of three each. In 2000, Jackson also became the actor to have received the most nominations, surpassing Bryan Buffington's previous record of five. Scott Clifton, Bryton James, David Lago and Joshua Morrow have also received five nominations each. As of the 2017 ceremony, Bryan Craig is the most recent winner in this category for his portrayal <b>of</b> <b>Morgan</b> Corinthos, on General Hospital.|$|E
5|$|Stevens's first {{political}} {{cause was}} Anti-Masonry, which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance {{and death of}} William Morgan, a Mason in Upstate New York; fellow Masons were presumed to be the killers <b>of</b> <b>Morgan</b> because they disapproved of his publishing a book revealing the order's secret rites. Since the leading candidate in opposition to President John Quincy Adams was General Andrew Jackson, a Mason who mocked opponents of the order, Anti-Masonry became closely associated with opposition to Jackson, and to his policies once he was elected president in 1828.|$|E

5|$|The low-lying damp ground {{can produce}} a visual effect known as a Fata Morgana.

5|$|Upon {{the system}} being {{classified}} as a tropical depression, {{a high risk of}} landfall near Port Arthur, Texas was noted, giving federal officials sufficient lead time to warn local residents about a possible approaching hurricane. As the system neared landfall, tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for the Gulf Coast of the United States. At 1200UTC on June25, the National Hurricane Center issued a gale warning and a hurricane watch, stretching from Port O'Connor, Texas to the mouth of the Mississippi River. A few hours later, a hurricane warning was issued for area west <b>of</b> <b>Morgan</b> City, Louisiana to Freeport, Texas. In advance of the approaching storm, roughly 22,000residents were evacuated, with 10,000from Galveston County, Texas alone.|$|E
