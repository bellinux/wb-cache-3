40|$|This paper {{examines}} the fickle nature <b>of</b> <b>Ghana’s</b> school system since colonialism. The school system has undergone several metamorphoses both in {{structure and content}} from the colonial epoch to post-independence. The management and reform <b>of</b> education in <b>Ghana</b> seem to have become synonymous with a change in political power. This paper argues that the management <b>of</b> <b>Ghana’s</b> educational system after fifty-five (55) years of independence is still undergoing turbulent experimentation to fine-tune to an efficient and effective school system. This instability in the structure and content <b>of</b> <b>Ghana’s</b> educational system looks more of a political jingle as well as military musical chairs rather than based on national consensus aimed at mitigating the many challenges facing the school system...|$|R

Sunderland started their first season under Bruce strongly, including victories against Arsenal and Liverpool, but then went 14 matches without a win over the winter, eventually finishing the 2009–10 season 13th. Sunderland completed the signing <b>of</b> <b>Ghana</b> international Asamoah Gyan in August 2010 for a fee around £13million, becoming their new record transfer fee. Sunderland started the next season strongly, {{this time with a}} seven match unbeaten run against teams including Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United. However, the run was ended with a 5–1 defeat to local rivals Newcastle United on 31 October 2010. Sunderland bounced back with another good run, the highlight being a 3–0 victory against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. This run left Sunderland challenging for a European qualification place by the end of 2010. However, striker Darren Bent left Sunderland for Aston Villa in January 2011 in a deal potentially worth £24 million (a record transfer fee received for the club). Following Bent's departure Sunderland suffered a mid-season slump and finished 10th— their highest top-flight finish for 10 years.|$|E

5|$|While visiting Ghana in 1960, Du Bois {{spoke with}} its {{president}} about {{the creation of}} a new encyclopedia of the African diaspora, the Encyclopedia Africana. In early 1961, Ghana notified Du Bois that they had appropriated funds to support the encyclopedia project, and they invited Du Bois to come to Ghana and manage the project there. In October 1961, at the age of 93, Du Bois and his wife traveled to Ghana to take up residence and commence work on the encyclopedia. In early 1963, the United States refused to renew his passport, so he made the symbolic gesture of becoming a citizen <b>of</b> <b>Ghana.</b> While it is sometimes stated that he renounced his U.S. citizenship at that time, and he did state his intention to do so, Du Bois never actually did. His health declined during the two years he was in Ghana, and he died on August 27, 1963, in the capital of Accra at the age of 95. Du Bois was buried in Accra near his home, which is now the Du Bois Memorial Centre. A day after his death, at the March on Washington, speaker Roy Wilkins asked the hundreds of thousands of marchers to honor Du Bois with a moment of silence. The Civil Rights Act of 1964, embodying many of the reforms Du Bois had campaigned for his entire life, was enacted almost a year after his death.|$|E
