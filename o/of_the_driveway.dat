5|$|Meanwhile, Chris sneaks into Meg's {{bedroom and}} reads her diary. Discovering him, Meg chases after Chris while Stewie walks by the staircase. Accidentally bumped by them, Stewie tumbles {{down the stairs}} and becomes unconscious, {{suffering}} a severe head wound. Chris and Meg hide the wound with a hat. Continuing the charade, they are approached by Peter, who asks how long Stewie has been unconscious. Peter reveals that he has knocked both of them out plenty of times, and wants to continue hiding Stewie's injury from Lois until he can frame her for it. The next day, noticing Lois pulling out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway,</b> Peter throws Stewie behind her car, making it appear as if Lois has run him over. Lois suggests they frame someone else, but Peter professes his love for her and suggests they take Stewie to the hospital. At the end of the show, Stewie walks in on the family with his head wrapped in bandages, revealing that many months have passed since his accident, he asks what happened to him.|$|E

500|$|A [...] two-storey {{detached}} house – often called a bungalow in Singapore – with European and Asian features, Sri Temasek has a symmetrical layout consisting of deep verandahs surrounding central living spaces. Notable architectural features include arches on its upper level, an intricate timber arcade {{with a mixture}} of eastern and western decorative motifs, and a Chinese moon gate (a circular gateway) on the building's second floor. Although few records exist concerning the moon gate's construction and usage, it is known to have made its appearance in the house in the 1960s and to have been designed and built by William Swaffield, a pre-World War II Comptroller of Government House and a professional furniture designer. It is constructed of chengal, teak and meranti wood. In the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> in front of the house, there is a brick pit that was originally used by horse-drawn carriages. The house was gazetted together with the Istana as a national monument on 14 February 1992.|$|E

2500|$|That same day, a {{dynamite}} {{bomb was}} discovered at the Tarrytown estate of John D. Archbold, President of the Standard Oil Company. [...] Police theorized {{the bomb was}} planted by anarchists and IWW radicals as a protest against Hill's execution. The bomb was discovered by a gardener, who found four sticks of dynamite, weighing a pound each, half hidden in a rut in a driveway fifty feet from the front entrance of the residence. The dynamite sticks were bound together by a length of wire, fitted with percussion caps, and wrapped {{with a piece of}} paper matching the color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway,</b> a path used by Archbold in going to or from his home by automobile. [...] The bomb was later defused by police.|$|E
2500|$|In 1828, Alexander Ferguson Reid {{inherited}} the estate, {{he was known}} as the [...] "Ayrshire Genius" [...] and was an inventor and collector of antiquities, as well as geological and natural history specimens. Reid dug into this Druidical Mound or Moot Hill several times and found nothing to help explain its age or purpose. Most maps do not show the ice house which lies to the east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> and some confusion in the descriptions may have arisen from misidentification of the ice house, limekiln and the Hutt Knowe. In the grounds of the present farm are curved ditches which are shown to have held water, either as ornamental ponds or for some practical purpose now unknown. The site had an apple orchard within the last 50 years or so, for John Hastings remembers raiding it.|$|E

2500|$|GSA's design {{specifications}} required that extensive underground parking {{be incorporated into}} the building. Breuer designed a lightweight, six-acre (2.4 hectares) plaza to fit as a sort of roof over the underground parking garage. The plaza surface would be covered in masonry [...] "stones", with a curving driveway (mimicking the building facade) to lead vehicular traffic into the garage entrance and exit (which were situated {{in the center of the}} plaza). An offshoot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> (set off by bollards) came up to the front doors to allow the limousines of high-ranking visitors to pull up directly to the building's front doors. Because the weight of the plaza/roof had to be kept light, no plantings (lawns, trees, shrubs, etc.) were envisioned for the plaza. Although the plaza was devoid of plants, its shape and vast expanse were designed to relate aesthetically to the nearby National Mall.|$|E
2500|$|Entering the 1973 season, Stewart {{had decided}} to retire. He {{nevertheless}} won at South Africa, Belgium, Monaco, the Netherlands, and Austria. His last and then record-setting 27th victory came at the Nürburgring with a 1–2 for Tyrrell. [...] "Nothing gave me more satisfaction than to win at the Nürburgring and yet, I was always afraid." [...] Stewart later said. [...] "When I left home for the German Grand Prix I always used to pause at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> and take a long look back.

[...] After the fatal crash of his teammate François Cevert in practice for the 1973 United States Grand Prix at Watkins Glen, Stewart retired one race earlier than intended and missed {{what would have been}} his 100th Grand Prix. Stewart had already won the Drivers' Championship at the Italian Grand Prix two races previously; this was a race where Stewart had to come into the pits to change a flat tyre, and he drove from 20th to finish 4th.|$|E
2500|$|Zoe Nelson was a seventeen-year-old {{motor vehicle}} repair student at Motherwell College, {{who lived with}} her mother, {{stepfather}} and younger sister at Crindledyke Crescent, Newmains, on {{the eastern edge of}} Wishaw.

Marieann Nelson, the girls' mother, described how the sisters had argued about Bayne outside the family home at around 5pm on 22 May. She said: [...] "Laura Anne ran out and flicked Zoe's hair and tried to slap her face {{and the two of them}} ended up having a fight at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> I split it up. I said 'Go away you cow and don't come back'. She said she wouldn't come back." [...] Isobel Park, Nelson's stepsister, said Zoe and Bayne seemed [...] "a bit intoxicated" [...] and that Laura Anne had been upset as [...] "she was supposed to be seeing Rab as well." [...] Zoe walked off with Bayne, who was drinking from a bottle of tequila, and was not seen alive by her family again.
