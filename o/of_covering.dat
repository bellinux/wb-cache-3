40|$|We obtain several results about {{stability}} of the Bergman kernel on a tower <b>of</b> <b>coverings</b> on complex manifolds. An effective version of Rhodes' result is given for a tower <b>of</b> <b>coverings</b> on a compact Riemann surface of genus {{greater than or equal}} to 2. Stability of the Bergman kernel is established for towers <b>of</b> <b>coverings</b> on hyperbolic Riemann surfaces and on complete Kaehler manifolds satisfying certain potential conditions. As a consequence, {{stability of}} the Bergman kernel is established for any tower <b>of</b> <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> Riemann surfaces when the top manifold is simply-connected.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop the theory <b>of</b> <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> a small {{connected}} category B. We {{show that the}} category <b>of</b> Galois <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> B {{is equivalent to the}} category <b>of</b> Galois <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> its fundamental groupoid. Making use of effective gradings of B we explicitly construct Galois coverings through a smash product analogous to the one considered in the linear case. In particular, the universal cover of B can be obtained from its fundamental groupoid. Comment: 19 page...|$|R

40|$|We {{develop a}} theory of group actions and {{coverings}} on Brauer graphs that parallels the theory of group actions and <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> algebras. In particular, we show that any Brauer graph can be covered by a tower <b>of</b> <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> Brauer graphs such that the topmost covering has multiplicity function identically one, no loops, and no multiple edges. Furthermore, we classify the <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> Brauer graph algebras that are again Brauer graph algebras.

40|$|We {{investigate}} topological realizations of higher-rank graphs. We {{show that}} the fundamental group of a higher-rank graph coincides with the fundamental group of its topological realization. We also show that topological realization of higher-rank graphs is a functor and that for each higher-rank graph Λ, this functor determines a category equivalence between the category <b>of</b> <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> Λ and the category <b>of</b> <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> its topological realization. We discuss how topological realization relates to two standard constructions for k-graphs: projective limits and crossed products by finitely generated free abelian groups...|$|R

5|$|In the {{long-range}} reconnaissance role, the SASR typically operates in small patrols of {{between five and}} six operators {{with the task of}} infiltrating enemy-held territory and providing intelligence on enemy activities and capabilities. During such tasks the SASR seeks to evade rather than confront the enemy. SASR soldiers also direct fire support including air strikes to destroy enemy installations and disrupt or kill enemy forces whenever possible. SASR reconnaissance patrols can be inserted by air (either by helicopter, parachute or high altitude parachute), land (on foot or by vehicle) or water (including by submarine, small boats, kayaks or diving) and have proved capable <b>of</b> <b>covering</b> long distances and staying concealed in jungle, desert and mountain terrain. SASR patrols may also conduct sabotage and short-duration raids on high-value targets, including headquarters, airfields and communications nodes.|$|E

We present the genus expansion of this generating function and prove, that the generating function <b>of</b> <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> genus 0 satisfies some system of differential equations.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the Prym variety of an étale cyclic <b>covering</b> <b>of</b> a hyperelliptic curve is isogenous to the product of two Jacobians. Moreover, if the degree <b>of</b> the <b>covering</b> is odd or {{congruent}} to 2 mod 4, then the canonical isogeny is an isomorphism.

5|$|Just as the Germans {{had made}} the halt decision, the Soviet Kalinin, Western and Southwestern Fronts {{launched}} a massive counteroffensive, aimed at driving Army Group Centre back from Moscow. The attacks were especially strong against Third Panzer Group, which had made some of the closest penetrations to the city. In three weeks of confused, savage fighting, Reinhardt extricated his troops from potential encirclement and fell back to the Lama River line. Placed in charge <b>of</b> <b>covering</b> the retreat, Model's harsh, almost brutal, style of leadership now paid dividends as panic threatened to infect the German columns. On several occasions, he restored order at a congested crossroads with a drawn pistol, but the retreat never became a rout.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Street scandal {{occurred}} in 1889, when a homosexual male brothel in Cleveland Street, Fitzrovia, London, {{was discovered by}} police. The government was accused <b>of</b> <b>covering</b> up the scandal to protect the names of aristocratic and other prominent patrons. At the time, sexual acts between men were illegal in Britain, and the brothel's clients faced possible prosecution and certain social ostracism if discovered. It was rumoured that Prince Albert Victor, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and second-in-line to the British throne had visited, though this has never been substantiated. Unlike overseas newspapers, the English press never named the Prince, but the allegation influenced {{the handling of the}} case by the authorities, and has coloured biographers' perceptions of him since.|$|E

5|$|In late 2008, Aamer Ahmed Khan of the BBC Urdu {{website and}} his colleagues {{came up with a}} novel way <b>of</b> <b>covering</b> the Taliban's growing {{influence}} in Swat. They decided to ask a schoolgirl to blog anonymously about her life there. Their correspondent in Peshawar, Abdul Hai Kakar, had been in touch with a local school teacher, Ziauddin Yousafzai, but could not find any students willing to do so, as it was considered too dangerous by their families. Finally, Yousafzai suggested his own daughter, 11-year-old Malala. At the time, Taliban militants led by Maulana Fazlullah were taking over the Swat Valley, banning television, music, girls' education, and women from going shopping. Bodies of beheaded policemen were being displayed in town squares. At first, a girl named Aisha from her father's school agreed to write a diary, but then the girl's parents stopped her from doing it because they feared Taliban reprisals. The only alternative was Yousafzai, four years younger than the original volunteer, and in seventh grade at the time. Editors at the BBC unanimously agreed.|$|E
5|$|The 17th Infantry Brigade was {{the last}} to land in Greece, {{arriving}} at Piraeus on 12April. Savige was placed in charge of Savige Force, consisting of the 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th and 2/11thInfantry Battalions, with armour, artillery, engineer and other support. He was given the mission <b>of</b> <b>covering</b> the Allied flank around Kalabaka. On 17April, Savige received orders to withdraw from Kalabaka, leaving only a rearguard behind. The road behind him, however, was packed with vehicles, and a crucial bridge on the only reasonably good road back had accidentally been demolished. Savige elected to disregard his orders and hold his position until the road was clear. He then managed to withdraw, although his driver's foot was broken in an air raid. Savige arrived back in Palestine on 1May 1941 and began the task of rebuilding his brigade. For the campaign in Greece, he received his fourth mention in despatches.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{isomorphism}} {{classes of}} several types <b>of</b> graph <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> a graph have been enumerated by many authors. Kwak and Lee (Canad. J. Math.

(Discrete Math. 214 (2000) 51) characterized a bipartite <b>covering</b> <b>of</b> G and enumerated the isomorphism classes of regular 2 p-fold bipartite <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> a non-bipartite graph. As a continuation of their study, we enumerate the isomorphism classes <b>of</b> regular balanced <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> a signed graph and those <b>of</b> regular bipartite <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> a graph. Jones (Math. Scand. 84 (1999) 23) enumerated the equivalence classes of the regular branched <b>coverings</b> <b>of</b> any given surface according to the degrees of branch points.
