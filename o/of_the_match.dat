30|$|Our {{experimental}} results {{have revealed that}} using <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matches</b> <b>of</b> all fingertip models gives the better result than other combinations (such as using maximum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matches).</b> A possible reason is that every model is weighted so that <b>the</b> information <b>of</b> all <b>matches</b> is used. In the case that if any matches of all fingertip models are not close to the answer (but <b>the</b> mean <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matches</b> {{is close to the}} answer), this can still produce the promising result. However, using <b>the</b> maximum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matches</b> would give <b>the</b> good result if <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>matches</b> are very scattered, but from our experiments, this case rarely happens when <b>matching</b> <b>the</b> models for tracking the fingertips.|$|R
