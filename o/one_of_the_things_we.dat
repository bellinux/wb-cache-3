500|$|In 1988, Namath and Madden, by {{then both}} {{television}} analysts, were interviewed for the 20th {{anniversary of the}} Heidi Game. According to Madden, the Oakland victory in the Heidi Game [...] "was kind of {{the start of the}} Raiders being a great team. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> were doing was getting these fantastic come-from-behind things...We didn't even know about the Heidi thing until we read about it the next day." [...] Namath noted, [...] "When I remember that game, it brings to mind the revenge factor we had against them going into the championship game. We paid them back then", to which Madden chuckled, [...] "He's full of crap." ...|$|E
500|$|On the game's community, Adams said, [...] "They are {{the reason}} I've {{been able to make}} the step from {{hobbyist}} to full-time developer. I'm lucky to be able to run with whatever ideas we have and try new things." [...] On players sending him forum posts or emails detailing their stories or events that happened during the game, Adams said, [...] "It's really gratifying, because it's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> set out to do is to get people to write these narratives about their game." [...] Adams has admitted that some feats of the community surprised even him. Adams stated that the most impressive thing he had ever seen done with the game was when a player managed to create a Turing-complete 8-bit computer powered by dwarves.|$|E

5000|$|Friedrich Hayek {{is quoted}} as saying that, [...] "You know, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I often have {{publicly}} said is that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> I most regret is not having returned to a criticism of Keynes's treatise, but it is as much true of not having criticized Milton's in Positive Economics, which in a way is quite as dangerous a book.'." ...|$|R

2500|$|... "Obviously, {{some of my}} {{personal}} drama was about feeling alone, and feeling like I was searching {{the world for the}} right person". [...] "And <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> want for this song and this record – even though it has personal stuff in it – is to be something everyone can relate to, and I think that the concept of people trying to find the right person is something that's universal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll feel {{differently}} about {{a good many}} things {{when you get to}} be my age," [...] said Janet tolerantly. [...] "That's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> learn as we grow older--how to forgive. It comes easier at forty than it did at twenty." ...|$|E

[...] "A day's shooting is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> take seriously, and manners are not at a higher premium here than I suppose {{they are in the}} wilds." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You won't," [...] Margaret rejoined. [...] "You know {{perfectly}} well that that is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> can never do. You've got to marry first. Then you can branch out in life in any direction you choose--art, travel, amours, or millinery. You can help yourself with both hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|His companion's red {{face flushed}} a trifle, but he laughed. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "that's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> needn't talk about, and I'm {{not sure that}} {{everybody}} would be so ready to mention it." [...] Then he drew back a trifle. [...] "Tom, you're greatly changed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and there}} is {{something}} else," [...] said MacIan, with slight hesitation. [...] "You see, we are on an almost unknown rock, lost in the Atlantic. The police will never catch us; but then neither may the public ever hear of us; and that was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> wanted." [...] Then, after a pause, he said, drawing in the sand with his sword-point: [...] "She may never hear of it at all." ...|$|E

6000|$|Also {{his opinion}} was that 'the best thing {{possible}} {{for this country}} is wholesale emigration,' of course of those whom the Colonies will accept. He said, 'People here are dissatisfied with their present condition and want a change. If we had money to assist them, there is practically no limit to the number who want to go. There {{are tens of thousands}} who would conform to the Canadian regulations. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> advise the man who has been forced out of the country is that rather than come into the town he should go to the Colonies.' ...|$|E
60|$|Now, it's {{all very}} well that these big people should be frightened out of their wits by an old wife talking with her mouth shut; that is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> happen to know about. All the old {{women in the world}} might talk with their mouths shut, and not frighten you or me, {{but there are plenty of}} other things that frighten us badly. And if we only knew about them, perhaps we should find them no more worthy to be feared than an old woman talking with her mouth shut. And the names of some of these things are Death, and Pain, and Sorrow.|$|E
60|$|Before I went to Russia I {{imagined}} that I {{was going to}} see an interesting experiment in a new form of representative government. I did see an interesting experiment, but not in representative government. Every one who is interested in Bolshevism knows the series of elections, from the village meeting to the All-Russian Soviet, by which the people's commissaries are supposed to derive their power. We were told that, by the recall, the occupational constituencies, and so on, a new and far more perfect machinery had been devised for ascertaining and registering the popular will. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> hoped to study was the question whether the Soviet system is really superior to Parliamentarism in this respect.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{brought the}} keg of whiskey and brandy from Red Gulch to-day that Doctor Duchesne spoke of," [...] he resumed presently. [...] "You know {{he said we}} ought to have some in common stock that he could always rely upon in emergencies, and for use after the tule fever. I didn't agree with him, and told him how I had brought Sam Denver through an attack with quinine and arrowroot, but he laughed and wanted to know if we'd 'resolved' that {{everybody}} should hereafter have the Denver constitution. That's the trouble with those old army surgeons,--they never can get over the 'heroics' of their past. Why he told Parson Jennings that he'd rather treat a man for jim-jams than one that was dying for want of stimulants. However, the liquor is here, and <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>we</b> must settle tomorrow is the question if it ought not to be issued only on Duchesne's prescription. When I made that point to him squarely, he grinned again, and wanted to know if I calculated to put the same restriction on the sale of patent medicines and drugs generally." ...|$|E
