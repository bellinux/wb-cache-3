40|$|Abstract. Wireless {{distributed}} sensor {{networks have}} gained a new importance {{in a wide}} spectrum of ubiquitous computing applications. This is largely due to the recent advancement in sensor nodes with low-cost RF communication capa-bility. Although the <b>operating</b> <b>pattern</b> of sensor network applications resembles a traditional distributed computing platform, they present very unique technical challenges and constraints that are ineluctable to developers. Considering the operating environment is constrained by extremely limited hardware resources, we present a finite state machine based operating system for sensor nodes that can meet the seemingly contradictory design requirements of high concur-rency and reconfigurability in spite of their limited resources. In this paper, we explore the sensor network management protocol, which is a largely untouched region in sensor network research. For this, we make use of the simple but powerful SenOS operating system. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In the {{electricity}} market, market clearing price (MCP) changes {{depending upon the}} demand profile. The MCP is high in high-demand time periods and lower during off-peak periods. Due to this volatility of MCP, Load service entities (LSEs) and their customers face a risk of higher cost. Demand-side management (DSM) is an efficient method to reduce MCP at peak periods and is helpful in load leveling. One of the DSM techniques is to use energy storage (ES) systems on demand-side in order to change demand profile. This paper evaluates the influence of demand-side energy storage on MCP when the <b>operating</b> <b>pattern</b> of ES system is governed by LSE with consideration of MCP variations. The market dispatch problem in the pool-based day-ahead electricity market is formulated so as to maximize the social welfare of market participants subject to operational and security constraints.

Therefore, we report the optimum operation scheduling method such that the total fuel consumption {{is less than the}} fuel supply, the total NO_ 2 emission is less than the constrained emission, and that operation becomes economically. In our method, for easy calculation, we introduce two assumptions and approximate calculations. The first approximation is that the optimum start-up and shut-down pattern of thermal units is determined in disregard for lower and upper power limits of each unit. The second approximation is that Lagrange 2 ̆ 7 s multipliers are little change when one unit shuts-down for a single time interval from any <b>operating</b> <b>pattern.</b> We show the appropriateness of our method by applying it to a model system.

Furthermore, regional disparities in economic development in the past years have grown, and financial difficulties in poor areas have worsened.

40|$|Abstract. The {{emergence}} of data-intensive applications in mobile en-vironments {{has resulted in}} portable electronic systems with increasingly large dynamic memories. The typical <b>operating</b> <b>pattern</b> exhibited by these applications is a relatively short burst of operations followed by longer periods of standby. Due to their periodic refresh requirements, dynamic memories consume substantial power even during standby and thus {{have a significant impact}} on battery lifetime. In this paper we investigate a methodology for designing dynamic mem-ory with low data-retention power. Our approach relies on the fact that the refresh period of a memory array is dictated by only a few, worst-case leaky cells. In our scheme, multiple refresh periods are used to reduce energy dissipation by selectively refreshing only the cells that are about to lose their stored values. Additional energy savings are achieved by using error-correction to restore corrupted cell values and thus allow for extended refresh periods. We describe an exact O(nk− 1) -time algorithm that, given a memory array with n refresh blocks and two positive in-tegers k and l, computes k refresh periods that maximize the average refresh period of a memory array when refreshing occurs in blocks of l cells. In simulations with 16 Mb memory arrays and a (72, 64) modified Hamming single-error correction code, our scheme results in an average refresh period of up to 11 times longer than the original refresh period. ...|$|E

The collected data included a survey of mechanical and manual operations, house dimensions, operations and machines used, and machinery operating patterns inside the houses. The measurements included working width and operating and non-operating times.

The average operating speeds was 3. 28, 2. 65, 1. 97, 4. 1 and 0. 83 km/hr for plowing, cultivating, ridging, line opening, and spraying respectively.

An aircraft performance analysis showed similarities between the predicted performance and capability of Very Light Jets and the performance of existing Light Jets. Based on this an analysis of <b>operating</b> <b>patterns</b> of existing Light Jets was used to predict how Very Light Jets will be operated. Using 396 days of traffic data from the FAA Enhanced Traffic Management System (ETMS), the <b>operating</b> <b>patterns</b> of existing Light Jets were analyzed. It was found that 64 % of all the flights flown by Light Jets had their origin, destination or both within the top 23 regional airport systems in the continental United States. This concentration of LJ traffic was found in areas of the air transportation system that are currently exhibiting dense traffic and capacity constraints. The structure of the network of routes flown by existing Light Jets was also studied and a model of network growth was developed. It is anticipated that this concentration will persist with emerging Very Light Jet traffic. This concentration of traffic at key areas in the system will have implications for air traffic control management and airport activity. For regional airport systems, core airports are expected to saturate and, reliever airports will become critical for accommodating traffic demand. The entry of Very Light Jets will significantly increase the traffic load at the terminal airspace; Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON).
