5|$|Another {{earthquake}} {{struck in}} 1202, {{and it may}} have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th-century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and 1170; the earlier structure became the castle's inner court or ward. If there was a circuit of walls surrounding the inner court that pre-dated the current outer walls, no trace <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been discovered.|$|E

Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers will attack if they feel threatened or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed to be responsible for an attack on a twelve-year-old boy.|$|E

5|$|Nerva was succeeded without {{incident}} by his adopted son Trajan, who {{was greeted by}} the Roman populace with much enthusiasm. According to Pliny the Younger, Trajan dedicated a temple in honour of Nerva, yet no trace <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> ever been found; nor was a commemorative series of coins for the Deified Nerva issued until ten years after his death. According to Cassius Dio, however, the Guard prefect responsible for the mutiny against Nerva, Casperius Aelianus, was 'dismissed' upon Trajan's accession.|$|E

5|$|The {{currency}} {{of the islands}} during Venetian rule was the Venetian lira, as in Venice. There was a special issue for the Islands; the observe side <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> the complete or shertened inscription CORFU/CEFALONIA/ZANTE in three lines. The reserve depicts the winged and haloed lion of Saint Marc in a front view, holding {{the book of the}} Gospel in his fore-paws.

5|$|The hardnose shark (Carcharhinus macloti) is {{a species}} of requiem shark, in the family Carcharhinidae, so named because of the heavily calcified cartilages in its snout. A small bronze-coloured shark {{reaching}} a length <b>of</b> , <b>it</b> <b>has</b> a slender body and a long, pointed snout. Its two modestly sized dorsal fins have distinctively elongated rear tips. The hardnose shark is widely distributed in the western Indo-Pacific, from Kenya to southern China and northern Australia. It inhabits warm, shallow waters close to shore.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1130s England began to descend into {{a period of}} civil war known as the Anarchy, during which the {{supporters}} of King Stephen fought {{with those of the}} Empress Matilda for control of the kingdom. William de Mohun's eldest son, also called William, was a noted supporter of Matilda, and Dunster was considered one of her faction's strongest castles in the south-west. In 1138 forces loyal to Stephen besieged the castle; a siege castle was built nearby, but all trace <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> been lost. William successfully held the castle and was made the Earl of Somerset by the grateful Empress. Chroniclers subsequently complained {{of the way in which}} he subsequently raided and controlled the region by force during the war, causing much destruction. In the aftermath of the conflict, William's son, another William, inherited the castle after a short period of royal ownership under Henry II. William appears to have insisted that his tenants agree to help repair and maintain the castle walls as part of their feudal service.|$|E
5|$|Megalosaurus was, in 1824, {{the first}} genus of non-avian dinosaur to be validly named. The type species is Megalosaurus bucklandii, named in 1827. In 1842, Megalosaurus {{was one of}} three genera on which Richard Owen based his Dinosauria. On Owen's {{directions}} a model was made as one of the Crystal Palace Dinosaurs, which greatly increased the public interest for prehistoric reptiles. Subsequently, over fifty other species would be classified under the genus, originally because dinosaurs were not well known, but even during the 20th century after many dinosaurs had been discovered. Today it is understood these additional species were not directly related to M. bucklandii, which is the only true Megalosaurus species. Because a complete skeleton <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> never been found, much is still unclear about its build.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the college were built using rubble from Oxfordshire dressed with local stone. The {{remaining}} parts of the 17th-century walls are dressed with Headington stone, which was a common building material in Oxford at that time: the geologist W. J. Arkell wrote that it was used for every building in Oxford constructed during this century for which records exist. Areas of Headington stone {{can be seen in}} the first quadrangle on the wall of the hall. It was only discovered towards the end of the 18th century that it did not weather well: the surface of the stone develops a hard crust, which blisters, bursts and comes off. Much <b>of</b> <b>it</b> <b>has</b> subsequently been replaced with other materials as a result.|$|E
