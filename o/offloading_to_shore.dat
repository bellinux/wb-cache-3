On 27 June, she sailed from Pearl Harbor with a cargo of ammunition, which she <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore</b> facilities and combatant ships after her arrival at Eniwetok on 8 July. She then shuttled between Eniwetok, Kwajalein, Makin, Majuro, Saipan, and Tinian, helping to carry ammunition to forward areas for issue to the fleet. At Tinian on 4 October, her stern touched bottom in heavy swells, damaging both screws, and [...] and an Army tug towed her back to Pearl Harbor. After arrival on 5 November, she underwent repairs and temporary conversion into a net cargo ship.|$|R

40|$|Data traffic over {{cellular}} networks is exhibiting {{an ongoing}} exponential growth, increasing by {{an order of}} magnitude every year and has already surpassed voice traffic. This increase in data traffic demand has led to a need for solutions to enhance capacity provision, whereby traffic <b>offloading</b> <b>to</b> Wi-Fi is one means that can enhance realised capacity. Though <b>offloading</b> <b>to</b> Wi-Fi networks has matured over the years, a number of challenges are still being faced by operators to its realization. In this article, we carry out a survey of the practical challenges faced by operators in data traffic <b>offloading</b> <b>to</b> Wi-Fi networks.

50|$|To {{ease the}} {{load on the}} central server, many {{auxiliary}} services are <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> specialized servers which can run on separate machines. For example, the user name and password authentication at login is <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> a server which works with a SQL database. The conversations of logged in chatters are not slowed while new chatters are authenticated. Also, management of presence - who is in which room - is maintained in a separate server, and searching for a user by name is <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> another server. There are also separate servers for managing buddy lists, game and tournament scoring, managing the chat auditoriums, and for miscellaneous statistics gathering.|$|R

40|$|To {{reduce the}} load on {{cellular}} networks, <b>offloading</b> <b>to</b> Wi-Fi {{has long been}} discussed as a technological solution. Despite advances in scheduling algorithms and incentive schemes, most mobile operators do not actively promote Wi-Fi offloading and most Wi-Fi usage is limited to stationary in-home contexts of use. This study assesses the proportion of users on the street that can be <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> Wi-Fi access points, taking into account different city topologies, speed of movement and technical characteristics of Wi-Fi access points. We show {{that the proportion of}} users on the street that can be <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> Wi-Fi heavily depends on their speed of moving around, the reach of access points and the delay in logging on to access points. However, even when using standard configurations for access points, base stations and smartphones, half the outdoor users can be <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> Wi-Fi. These results are consistent for any type of realistic topology of roads in the city. Based on the results, operators are recommended <b>to</b> promote Wi-Fi <b>offloading</b> as it massively reduces the load on cellular networks...|$|R

30|$|Consider {{the case}} when the inter-cell user {{association}} is employed in a N-tier cellular network which consists of N spatially and spectrally coexisting tiers, and each tier is distinguished by its transmit power, cell density, and data rate [29]. In this case, the information required to perform the inter-cell user association might exchange among the cells in only some tiers. For example, it is not allowed that a user is <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> a cell for a closed subscriber group (CSG) {{if it is not}} a member of the corresponding CSG [30]. It means that a given user in a cell might not be <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> some neighboring cells. This limits the performance improvement compared to {{the case when}} the information exchanges among all cells in all tiers.|$|R
30|$|Recent {{researches}} on computation offloading mainly {{focus on}} the code partitioning and offloading techniques, assuming that mobile codes are <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> a prepared server or a predefined Cloud [14 – 18]. But, in practice, it needs <b>to</b> <b>offload</b> computation in a dynamic manner. On one hand, applications are different in computation complexity and coupling degree. So mobile codes need to be executed on different places even if the device contexts are the same. For instance, when the mobile device uses a remote cloud with a poor network connection, some computation-intensive codes need <b>to</b> be <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> the server, but others are better executed locally. On the other hand, {{the context of a}} mobile device, such as locations, networks and available computing resources, changes continuously as it moves throughout the day. So it needs to select an appropriate cloud resource for <b>offloading</b> according <b>to</b> the device context. For instance, when a mobile device has a good network connection, it can use a remote cloud to outsource the computation-intensive tasks, in order to improve application performance and user experience. When the mobile device suffers from a poor network connection, it can use a nearby cloudlet [19] instead.|$|R
30|$|In addition, traffic <b>offloading,</b> e.g., <b>to</b> Wi-Fi {{access points}} (APs), {{has proven to}} be a {{valuable}} complementary approach. According to [2, 3], an acceptable portion of traffic can be <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> APs, just by deferring delay-tolerant services for a pre-specified maximum interval until reaching an AP. Offloading approaches are generally based on using other connectivity capabilities of mobile terminals, whenever it is possible, instead of using further expensive cellular bands. The authors in [4] discuss the economics of traffic offloading, and in [5] address an energy-saving analysis.|$|R
30|$|Two-tier {{cellular}} {{networks in}} which small cells are overlaid with macro-cells have attracted considerable attention because these networks {{are expected to}} accommodate the rapidly increasing mobile traffic. Enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC) has also been proposed to further enhance the overall system performance by offloading more macro-cell users to small cells. Even with this approach, {{it is likely that}} macro-cell users are effectively <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> the small cells in the network because of the following reasons: i) some macro-cell users are <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> small cells by simply comparing their received signal strengths, and ii) the almost blank subframe (ABS) in the small cell is strictly assigned to users who experience strong interference from its nearby macro-cells. In this paper, we propose a load balance scheme for improving the downlink network-wide proportional fairness (PF) for two-tier cellular networks using eICIC. In particular, employing a cumulative distribution function-based scheduling scheme that supports sharing ABS across all users in each small cell, the proposed scheme recursively combines i) the user association between the cells and ii) ABS rate adaptation to improve the network PF. Through system-level simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme noticeably improves the network PF compared to the eICIC scheme regardless of the number of macro-cell users <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> small cells.|$|R

50|$|In {{previous}} {{versions of}} Windows, all processing needed to receive or transfer data over one network interface {{was done by}} a single processor, even in a multi processor system. With supported network interface adapters, Windows Vista can distribute the job of traffic processing in network communication among multiple processors. This feature is called Receive Side Scaling. Windows Vista also supports network cards with TCP Offload Engine, that have certain hardware-accelerated TCP/IP-related functionality. Windows Vista uses its TCP Chimney <b>Offload</b> system <b>to</b> <b>offload</b> <b>to</b> such cards framing, routing, error-correction and acknowledgement and retransmission jobs required in TCP. However, for application compatibility, only TCP data transfer functionality is <b>offloaded</b> <b>to</b> the NIC, not TCP connection setup. This will remove some load from the CPU. Traffic processing in both IPv4 and IPv6 can be offloaded. Windows Vista also supports NetDMA, which uses the DMA engine to allow processors to be freed from the hassles of moving data between network card data buffers and application buffers. It requires specific hardware DMA architectures, such as Intel I/O Acceleration to be enabled.|$|R
30|$|Computation offloading. Another major {{application}} is computation offloading through which energy or computation-constrained devices can scalably handle complex tasks by <b>offloading</b> their computation <b>to</b> the cloud. The cloudlet approach[210] is to provision a trusted well-connected and resource-rich cluster of computers {{which is available}} for use by mobile devices that are close. When computation <b>offload</b> <b>to</b> the cloud is undesirable due to any reason (such as cost, delay, etc.), then mobile users can connect to a nearby cloudlet.|$|R
40|$|<b>Offloading</b> <b>to</b> {{hardware}} {{components that}} support the primary task of a system enables sea-paration of concerns and allows both the primary and offloaded components of a system {{to be easy to}} understand, manage, and evolve independent of other components. In this dissertation, we explore the software mechanisms required <b>to</b> effectively <b>offload</b> functionality <b>to</b> idle processing elements. We present the design, implementation, and evalua-tion of three system architectures – TCPServers, Orion, and FileWall, which offload functional-ity for improving performance (TCPServers), improving availability (Orion), and for extending functionality (FileWall). We explore software mechanisms <b>to</b> <b>offload</b> functionality <b>to</b> a subset of processors in an Symmetric Multiprocessor (SMP) system, a programmable network inter-face, and an interposing network middlebox to realize the three system architectures. TCPServers is a system architecture that <b>offloads</b> network processing <b>to</b> a subset of proces-sors in an SMP system. Network processing imposes direct and indirect overheads on server systems. It directly affects system performance since it executes at a higher priority than ap-plication tasks and prevents other components of the system from executing simultaneously on the processors.

30|$|The second <b>offloading</b> {{mechanism}} is <b>to</b> send the whole application to a VM instance identified {{in a remote}} server. No smart decision is required for this method.
