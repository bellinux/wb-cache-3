5|$|Gilbert Charles Stuart (born Stewart; December 3, 1755– July 9, 1828) was an American painter from Rhode Island who {{is widely}} {{considered}} one of America's foremost portraitists. His best known work is the unfinished portrait <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> that is {{sometimes referred to as}} The Athenaeum, begun in 1796 and never finished. Stuart retained the portrait and used it to paint 130 copies which he sold for $100 each. The image <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> featured in the painting has appeared on the United States one-dollar bill {{for more than a century}} and on various U.S. postage stamps of the 19th century and early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|Peanut, or {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea), {{originally from}} South America, {{has grown from}} a relatively minor crop {{to one of the most}} important commercial nut crops, in part due to the work <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> Carver at the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The serious {{collection}} and publication of Washington's documentary record {{began with the}} pioneer work of Jared Sparks in the 1830s in Life and Writings <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> (12 vols., 1834–1837). The Writings <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> from the Original Manuscript Sources, 1745–1799 (1931–44) is a 37 volume set edited by John C. Fitzpatrick. It contains over 17,000 letters and documents and is available online from the University of Virginia. The definitive letterpress edition of his writings was begun by the University of Virginia in 1968, and today comprises 52 published volumes, with more to come. It contains everything written by Washington or signed by him, together with most of his incoming letters. Part of the collection is available online from the University of Virginia.|$|E

5|$|A famous story, {{possibly}} apocryphal, {{states that}} during the Battle of Princeton, when Alexander Hamilton, then the commander of an artillery battery, ordered his cannons to fire upon the British soldiers taking refuge in Nassau Hall, one of the cannonballs was shot through {{the head of the}} portrait of King George II that hung in the chapel, which was subsequently replaced with a portrait <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{made his}} {{literary}} debut in 1802 {{with a series}} of observational letters to the Morning Chronicle, written under the pseudonym Jonathan Oldstyle. After moving to England for the family business in 1815, he achieved international fame with the publication of The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon, Gent., serialized from 1819–20. He continued to publish regularly—and almost always successfully—throughout his life, and just eight months before his death (at age 76, in Tarrytown, New York), completed a five-volume biography <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Secretary of State regulates flag {{protocol}} {{as well as}} {{the distribution}} and sale of the state flag. Replica flags made for commercial sale are required to be approved by the Secretary of State. The state seal on the flag must be stitched on both sides with the profile <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> facing the same direction, making the Washington state flag among the most expensive U.S. state flags to manufacture.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Secretary of State issued {{standardized}} {{colors for}} the state flag in 1955, including the modern colors used in the state seal. The state seal itself was redesigned by Dick Nelms {{at the request of}} the Secretary of State in 1967, using Gilbert Stuart's famous portrait painting <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington.</b> The new state seal was approved by the state legislature in April 1967, placing it on the updated state flag with immediate effect.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{was born}} in 1838 near Charles Town, Virginia, in present-day West Virginia. She was the {{daughter}} of William Temple Washington, through whom she was a great-grandniece <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington,</b> first President of the United States, and a grandniece of Dolley Payne Todd Madison. Following her family's relocation to Stafford County, she and her family witnessed the Battle of Fredericksburg first hand during the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|After his maiden speech, Breckinridge took a {{more active}} role in the House. In debate with Ohio's Joshua Reed Giddings, he defended the Fugitive Slave Law's {{constitutionality}} and criticized Giddings for hindering the return of fugitive slaves. He opposed Tennessee Congressman Andrew Johnson's Homestead Bill, fearing it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Although generally opposed to funding local improvements, he supported the repair of two Potomac River bridges to avoid higher costs later. Other minor stands included supporting measures to benefit his district's hemp farmers, voting against giving the president ten more appointments to the U.S. Naval Academy, and opposing funds for a sculpture <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> because the sculptor proposed depicting Washington in a toga.|$|E

5|$|Finally {{the protests}} became an armed {{rebellion}}. The first {{shots were fired}} at the Oliver Miller Homestead in present-day South Park Township, Pennsylvania, about ten miles south of Pittsburgh. As word of the rebellion spread across the frontier, {{a whole series of}} loosely organized resistance measures were taken, including robbing the mail, stopping court proceedings, and the threat of an assault on Pittsburgh. One group disguised as women assaulted a tax collector, cropped his hair, coated him with tar and feathers, and stole his horse. Another group bombarded the estate of the tax collector John Neville, a friend <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1968 Brown {{served as}} a Fulbright {{lecturer}} at Australian National University and Monash University in Australia. Brown travelled to every part of southern Asia and southern Europe including Singapore, Jaipur, Istanbul, France and Italy before returning to America. On her return to the U.S. in 1971 she became a professor at George Washington University in the American Studies Department. Brown was the only black faculty member to serve full-time. She remained a member <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> University until her death in 1976.

5|$|James Abbott McNeill Whistler {{was born}} in the United States in 1834, the son <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> Whistler, a railway engineer. In 1843, his father {{relocated}} the family to Saint Petersburg, Russia, where James received training in painting. After a stay in England, he returned to America to attend the US Military Academy at West Point in 1851. In 1855, he made his way back to Europe, determined to dedicate himself to painting. He settled in Paris at first, but in 1859 moved to London, where he would spend most of the remainder of his life. There he met Dante Gabriel Rossetti {{and other members of the}} Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who would have a profound influence on Whistler.|$|E

5|$|Longfellow {{returned}} to the United States in 1836 and took up the professorship at Harvard. He was required to live in Cambridge {{to be close to}} the campus and, therefore, rented rooms at the Craigie House in the spring of 1837. The home was built in 1759 and was the headquarters <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> during the Siege of Boston beginning in July 1775. Elizabeth Craigie owned the home, the widow of Andrew Craigie, and she rented rooms on the second floor. Previous boarders included Jared Sparks, Edward Everett, and Joseph Emerson Worcester. It is preserved today as the Longfellow House–Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site.|$|E
5|$|Nuts have a {{rich history}} as food. For many {{indigenous}} {{peoples of the}} Americas, {{a wide variety of}} nuts, including acorns, American beech, and others, served as a major source of starch and fat over thousands of years. Similarly, a wide variety of nuts have served as food for Indigenous Australians for many centuries. Other culinary nuts, though known from ancient times, have seen dramatic increases in use in modern times. The most striking such example is the peanut. Its usage was popularized by the work <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> Carver, who discovered and popularized many applications of the peanut after employing peanut plants for soil amelioration in fields used to grow cotton.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Coonley's son-in-law Waldron Faulkner, who, with his son (also an architect) Avery Coonley Faulkner, later became significant contributors to the design <b>of</b> <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> University and American University in Washington, D.C. The design ties the building to the land {{in the style of}} the Prairie School, at the same time employing the handcrafted features and human scale typical of the American Arts and Crafts (or American Craftsman) style. The easy access to the outdoors, ground floor classrooms, separate science laboratories, and planned outdoor play area are among the features of the design that would later be adopted by schools throughout the US after World War II.|$|E
