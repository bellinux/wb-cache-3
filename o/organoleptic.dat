25|$|After obtaining {{an alcohol}} content {{of at least}} 12 percent by volume, the mead {{undergoes}} racking prior to ageing. Leaving the pitched wort on the lees beyond the still fermentation period would adversely affect the mead's <b>organoleptic</b> properties because of yeast autolysis. Ageing (maturing) and siphoning (decantation) is repeated as necessary to prevent unwanted processes from {{taking place in the}} lees. During ageing, it is possible to carry out pasteurisation and filtration. This stage is essential for ensuring that the product has the right <b>organoleptic</b> properties.|$|E
25|$|The {{first is}} to cool the wine to a {{negative}} temperature near freezing for several weeks. The potassium bitartrate crystals precipitate and can be removed by filtration prior to packaging in bottles or bag-in-boxes. This solution is costly in refrigeration energy and can negatively affect the <b>organoleptic</b> qualities of the wine.|$|E
25|$|A {{weakness}} of the Scoville <b>Organoleptic</b> Test is its imprecision due to human subjectivity, depending on the taster's palate and their number of mouth heat receptors, which varies greatly among people. Another weakness is sensory fatigue; the palate is quickly desensitized to capsaicinoids after tasting a few samples {{within a short time}} period. Results vary widely (up to ± 50%) between laboratories.|$|E
25|$|In the Scoville <b>organoleptic</b> test, {{an exact}} weight of dried pepper is {{dissolved}} in alcohol {{to extract the}} heat components (capsaicinoids), then diluted in a solution of sugar water. Decreasing concentrations of the extracted capsaicinoids are given to a panel of five trained tasters, until a majority (at least three) can no longer detect the heat in a dilution. The heat level is based on this dilution, rated in multiples of 100 SHU.|$|E
25|$|Oxidation {{can occur}} {{throughout}} the winemaking process, {{and even after}} the wine has been bottled. Anthocyanins, catechins, epicatechins and other phenols present in wine are those most easily oxidised, {{which leads to a}} loss of colour, flavour and aroma - sometimes referred to as flattening. In most cases compounds such as sulfur dioxide or erythorbic acid are added to wine by winemakers, which protect the wine from oxidation and also bind with some of the oxidation products to reduce their <b>organoleptic</b> effect. Apart from phenolic oxidation, the ethanol present within wine can also be oxidised into other compounds responsible for flavour and aroma taints.|$|E
25|$|Tasting {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the sensory analysis (also referred to as <b>organoleptic</b> analysis) of wine. Employing a trained or consumer panel, oenologists may perform a variety of tests on the taste, aroma, mouthfeel and appeal of wines. Difference tests are important in determining whether different fermentation conditions or new vineyard treatments alter the character of a wine, something particularly important to producers who aim for consistency. Preference testing establishes consumer preference, while descriptive analysis determines the most prominent traits of the wine, some of which grace back labels. Blind tasting and other laboratory controls help mitigate bias and assure statistically significant results. Many large wine companies now boast their own sensory team, optimally consisting of a Ph.D. sensory scientist, a flavor chemist and a trained panel.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though it}} is a very old industry, meat {{production}} continues to be shaped strongly by the evolving demands of customers. The trend towards selling meat in pre-packaged cuts has increased the demand for larger breeds of cattle, which are better suited to producing such cuts. Even more animals not previously exploited for their meat are now being farmed, especially the more agile and mobile species, whose muscles tend to be developed better than those of cattle, sheep or pigs. Examples are the various antelope species, the zebra, water buffalo and camel, as well as non-mammals, such as the crocodile, emu and ostrich. Another important trend in contemporary meat production is organic farming which, while providing no <b>organoleptic</b> benefit to meat so produced, meets an increasing demand for organic meat.|$|E
25|$|A {{third way}} is electrodialysis: an {{electric}} current between two plates attracts the wine ions and eliminates them. However, this solution not only acts on tartaric acid but also other compounds especially potassium {{which is responsible}} for the formation of insoluble bitartrate and also modifies the <b>organoleptic</b> qualities. However, it does allow a definitive stabilization. Reports of high tartaric stability in white wines matured on lees has led to research in this area. A protein from the hydrolyzate of the yeast (mannoproteins) allows salts of tartar to keep their solubility. The addition of this compound industrially permits a good quality stabilization. This solution is the least expensive for energy and refrigeration equipment and does not alter the aromatic perception of wine. Nevertheless, tests conducted by the Cooperative Institute for Wine of Languedoc-Roussillon did not show conclusive effectiveness.|$|E

2500|$|Pasteurization is {{credited}} with dramatically reducing pathogens found in milk. This improves the shelf-life and safety of the processed milk. Advocates of drinking raw milk claim various health benefits they attribute to raw milk that are lost in the pasteurization process, and claim that raw milk can be produced as hygienically as pasteurized milk. Raw milk advocates may {{go as far as}} to claim that untreated milk is a [...] "miracle cure" [...] for [...] illnesses such as asthma or gastrointestinal disorders. A 2006 systematic review of infections associated with raw milk contends that pasteurized milk is substantially safer than raw milk, and comparably nutritious to raw milk, therefore there is no scientific reason for choosing raw milk products. Similarly, a recent review authored by the Belgian Federal Agency for the Safety of the Food Chain and experts from Belgian universities and institutions concluded that [...] "raw milk poses a realistic health threat due to a possible contamination with human pathogens. It is therefore strongly recommended that milk should be heated before consumption. With the exception of an altered <b>organoleptic</b> [...] profile, heating (in particularly ultra high temperature and similar treatments) will not substantially change the nutritional value of raw milk or other benefits associated with raw milk consumption." ...|$|E
