40|$|In {{addressing}} {{issues related}} to problems of democratisation in Africa, this paper attempts to relate the issue {{to the need for}} citizenship education and the role that can play in social development. Citizenship should be central to the formation of viable civil societies that claim a tangible stake in national public spaces in post-Cold War Africa. These and related topics are discussed relative to new possibilities that could lead to the full realisation of the concept as well as the practice of enfranchised citizenship and inclusive social development in aspiring democracies in the Sub Saharan African context. The complexity of the development ‘problematique’ that Sub-Saharan Africa is facing is unique in that it is multi-dimensional, but above all else, politically located. It is, therefore, central to <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>here</b> that to correct the continent’s current schemes of underdevelopment, pragmatic schemes of governance must be achieved. To do that, we are suggesting, new possibilities of citizenship education should be formulated for the general African scene in general, and for democratising but still both institutionally and economically weakened Zambia...|$|R

(M108) “The {{war is a}} grievous affair,” Mr. Gladstone said to Brand, “and adds much to our cares, for to {{maintain}} our neutrality {{in such a case}} as this, will be a most arduous task. On the face of the facts France is wrong, but as to personal trustworthiness the two moving spirits on the respective sides, Napoleon and Bismarck, are nearly on a par.” His individual activity was unsparing. He held almost daily conferences with Lord Granville at the foreign office; criticised and minuted despatches; contributed freely to the drafts. “There has not, I think,” he wrote to Bright (Sept. 12), “been a single day on which Granville and I have not been in anxious communication {{on the subject of the}} war.” When Lord Granville went to Walmer he wrote to Mr. Gladstone, “I miss <b>our</b> <b>discussions</b> <b>here</b> over the despatches as they come in very much.” “I hope I need not say that while you are laid up with gout at Walmer,” Mr. Gladstone wrote in October, “I am most ready to start at a few hours’ notice at any time of day or night, to join you upon any matter which you may find to require it. Indeed I could not properly or with comfort remain here upon any other terms.” Details of this agitating time, with all its convulsions and readjustments, belong to the history of Europe. The part taken by Mr. Gladstone and his cabinet was for several months in pretty close harmony with the humour of the country. It will be enough for us to mark their action at decisive moments.|$|R
40|$|We used cold target recoil ion {{momentum}} spectroscopy (COLTRIMS) {{to investigate}} the decay of Ne 2 after K-shell photoionization. The breakup into Ne 1 +/Ne 2 + shows interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD) occurring after a preceding atomic Auger decay. The molecular frame angular distributions of the photoelectron and the ICD electron show distinct, asymmetric features, which imply localization of the K-vacancy created {{at one of the}} two atomic sites of the Ne 2 and an emission of the ICD electron from a localized site. The experimental results are supported by calculations in the frozen core Hartree–Fock approach. (Some figures in this article are in colour only in the electronic version) Are inner-shell holes in homonuclear diatomic molecules localized at one of the atoms or delocalized over the two equivalent sites?

30|$|It {{should be}} noted, however, that <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>here</b> applies to {{recurrent}} excitation and inhibition. Tuned excitation and inhibition, when {{measured in terms}} of the total excitatory and inhibitory conductances in intracellular recordings, are the total excitatory and inhibitory input that a neuron observes. It is therefore possible that the tuning of the feedforward input is dominant in the tuning. Likewise, feedforward inhibition, mediated by disynaptic inhibition, can have the same tuning as the feedforward excitatory input, as the former is mediating it. The mechanisms discussed here, however, apply to recurrent excitation and inhibition, since they are a consequence of the dynamics of a network of synaptically connected neurons and, in particular, recruitment of feedback inhibition within the network.|$|E

Based on the results for a single population model, we derive sufficient conditions for the permanence of two interacting competitive and predator-prey dispersing systems. 1...|$|E
30|$|Findings on {{the impact}} of PPPs on {{education}} quality indicates that the implementation of PPPs in Tanzania higher education has {{had an impact on the}} quality of education provided by the private sub sector. Scholars agree at some point that the quality dimension of education is better seen when the education system is viewed as a complex manufacturing industry with inputs, process and outputs (Scheerens 2011). Based on this conception of education, input and the quality of the process are what determine the quality of outputs or graduates. As we could not get data about the output indicator of quality because of our research design, <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>here</b> focuses on inputs (number and qualifications of academic staff) and partly on the process indicator (teaching and learning).|$|E
30|$|In this section, we {{investigate}} the convergence {{properties of the}} SO-DCTS algorithm in undirected networks when there is both deterministic and random (Gaussian) delay between network nodes during local time information exchange. In [19], we motivate why the Gaussian assumption is appropriate to model the undeterministic timing differences between nodes exchanging either MAC layer or physical layer timing information. We do not reiterate those arguments here but rather present convergence results for the SO-DCTS algorithm when such timing differences exist. We have separately examined {{the performance of the}} SO-DCTS algorithm considering alternate delay distributions, for example, exponential delay distribution [20]. Results show similar performance bounds as those presented in this paper for the Gaussian assumption. For this reason, we constrain <b>our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>here</b> to the more common Gaussian delay model.|$|E

The alignment was measured by polarized confocal Raman spectroscopy over diffraction-limit circular spots with ∼ 0. 3 μm diameter. <b>Our</b> <b>discussion</b> <b>here</b> focuses on the intense symmetric methyl-group vibration centered at 2907 cm- 1, whose Raman scattering intensity is found to depend on whether incident light is polarized in the x or y direction of the surface, the x direction being parallel to one of the mica optical axes. Furthermore, the Raman peak broadens significantly relative to that of bulk PDMS while remaining Lorentzian in shape, implying slower but homogeneous vibrational dephasing. However, the preferred orientation differs, apparently stochastically, from spot to spot on the surface. Possible origins of this heterogeneous surface-induced structure are discussed. close 6...|$|E
