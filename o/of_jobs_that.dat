5|$|George Herman Ruth Jr. {{was born}} in 1895 at 216 Emory Street in the Pigtown section of Baltimore, Maryland. Ruth's parents, George Herman Ruth Sr. (1871–1918) and Katherine Schamberger, were both of German American ancestry. According to the 1880 census, his parents were born in Maryland. His {{paternal}} grandparents were from Prussia and Hanover. Ruth Sr. worked a series <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> included lightning rod salesman and streetcar operator. The elder Ruth then became a counterman in a family-owned combination grocery and saloon business on Frederick Street. George Ruth Jr. {{was born in}} the house of his maternal grandfather, Pius Schamberger, a German immigrant and trade unionist. Only one of young George's seven siblings, his younger sister Mamie, survived infancy.|$|E

Still planning to pursue careers in entertainment, however, the twins —along with their older brother— co-founded Dividian Production Group in 2002, an independent film production company.|$|E
25|$|By 1840, New Orleans was {{the wealthiest}} {{city in the}} country and the third largest in population. The success of the city was based on the growth of {{international}} trade associated with products being shipped to and from the interior of the country down the Mississippi River. New Orleans also had the largest slave market in the country, as traders brought slaves by ship and overland to sell to planters across the Deep South. The city was a cosmopolitan port with a variety <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> attracted more immigrants than other areas of the South. Because of lack of investment, however, construction of railroads to span the region lagged behind the North. People relied most heavily on river traffic for getting their crops to market and for transportation.|$|E

30|$|A {{closely related}} problem is {{considered}} by Zheng et al. in [10] which study the problem <b>of</b> scheduling interactive <b>jobs</b> at a data center {{with the goal of}} maximizing the total utility <b>of</b> all the <b>jobs.</b> In their problem, the utility <b>of</b> a <b>job</b> {{is a function of the}} completed workload <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>job.</b> <b>That</b> is, the utility <b>of</b> a <b>job</b> varies when the completed workload <b>of</b> <b>that</b> <b>job</b> increases. The presented function in their work is nonlinear and concave. If the scheduling can be preemptive, then the authors can provide an optimal solution to solve the problem.|$|R
2500|$|The Humanistic Approach to {{job design}} was a {{reaction}} to [...] "worker dissatisfaction over Scientific Management" [...] and focused on providing employees with more input {{and an opportunity to}} maximize their personal achievement as referenced by Jex and Britt. Jobs should also provide intellectual stimulation, opportunities for creativity, and greater discretion over work-related activities. Two approaches used in the Humanistic Approach to job design are job rotation and job enrichment. Job rotation allows employees to switch to different jobs which allows them to learn new skills and provides them with greater variety. According to Jex and Britt, this would be most effective for simple jobs that can become mundane and boring over time. Job enrichment is focused on leveraging those aspects <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> are labeled motivators, such as control, intellectual challenge, and creativity. The most common form of job enrichment is vertical loading where additional tasks or discretion enhances the initial job design. While there is some evidence to support that job enrichment improves motivation, {{it is important to note}} that it is not effective for all people. Some employees are not more motivated by enriched jobs.|$|E
2500|$|In early January 2009, Romney {{supported}} the $750 billion federal {{economic stimulus package}} proposed by the incoming president, Barack Obama, {{who had not yet}} taken office. Romney said at the time: [...] "I frankly wish that the last Congress would have dealt with the stimulus issue and that the president [...] could assign that before leaving office. I think there is need for economic stimulus. Americans have lost about $11 trillion in net worth. That translates into about $400 billion a year less spending that they'll be doing, and that's net of additional government programs like Medicaid and unemployment insurance. And government can help make that up in a very difficult time.... I'd move quickly. These are unusual times. But it has to be something which relieves pressure on middle-income families. I think a tax cut is necessary for them as well as for businesses that are growing. We'll be investing in infrastructure and in energy technologies." [...] However, as a candidate for president in May 2012, Romney said that the economic stimulus package that had been enacted in February 2009 (the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) had been a waste of money that did little to jump-start the economy, and that the federal government had inflated the numbers <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> <b>that</b> had been created or preserved by the various projects funded through the stimulus program.|$|E
