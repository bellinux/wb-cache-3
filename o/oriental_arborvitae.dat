50|$|Platycladus is a {{distinct}} genus of evergreen coniferous tree in the cypress family Cupressaceae, containing only one species, Platycladus orientalis, also known as Chinese thuja, <b>Oriental</b> <b>arborvitae,</b> Chinese arborvitae, biota or oriental thuja. It is native to northwestern China, Korea, and the Russian Far East (Amur + Khabarovsk). It is also now naturalised as an introduced species elsewhere in Asia: eastward to Japan; southward to northern India; and westward to northern Iran.|$|E

40|$|In the {{semi-arid}} {{region of}} the Loess Plateau in China, a portable photosynthesis system (Li- 6400) and a portable steady porometer (Li- 1600) were used to study the quantitative relation between the soil water content (SWC) and trees' physiological parameters including net photosynthesis rate (Pn), carboxylation efficiency (CE), transpiration rate (Tr), water use efficiency of leaf (WUEL), stomatic conductivity (Gs), stomatal resistance (Rs), intercellular CO 2 (Ci), and stomatal limitation (Ls). These are criteria for grading and evaluating soil water productivity and availability in forests of Black Locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) and <b>Oriental</b> <b>Arborvitae</b> (Platycladus orientalis). The results indicated: To the photosynthesis of Locust and Arborvitae, the SWC of less than 4. 5 and 4. 0 % (relative water content (RWC) 21. 5 and 19. 0 %) belong to non-productivity and non-efficiency water; the SWC of 4. 510. 0 % (RWC 21. 547. 5 %) and 4. 08. 5 % (RWC 19. 040. 5 %) belong to low productivity and low efficiency water; the SWC of 10. 013. 5 % (RWC 47. 564. 0 %) and 8. 511. 0 % (RWC 40. 552. 0 %) belong to middle productivity and high efficiency water; the SWC of 13. 517. 0 % (RWC 64. 081. 0 %) and 11. 016. 0 % (RWC 52. 076. 0 %) belong to high productivity and middle efficiency water; the SWC of 17. 019. 0 % (RWC 81. 090. 5 %) and 16. 019. 0 % (RWC 76. 090. 5 %) belong to middle productivity and low efficiency water; the SWC of more than 19. 0 % (RWC 90. 5 %) belongs to low productivity and low efficiency water. The SWC of about 13. 5 and 11. 0 % (RWC 64. 0 and 52. 0 %) are called high productivity and high efficiency water, which provides the further evidence for Locust and Arborvitae to get both higher productivity (Pn and CE) and the highest WUEL and adaptation to the local environment, respectively.

Effects of three levels of irrigation frequency; five levels of increasing NaCl (max 8000 ppm) in the irrigation water; and, two different soil types on the growth and survival of Italian Cypress Cupressus sempervirens, <b>Oriental</b> <b>Arborvitae</b> Thuja orientalis, and She-Oak Casuarina equisetifolia tree seedings were studied under greenhouse conditions. There were {{significant differences between the}} species throughout the stress period with regard to the evaluated parameters. Height, diameter growth, and leaf water potential in all species were reduced by increasing water and salt stress throughout the stress period. Reductions in total, shoot and root dry weight by water and salt stress were significant. Higher reductions were associated with higher water or salinity stress level. However, the species differed in their response to the stress treatments. Thuja had the lowest reductions in all measured growth parameters, followed by Casuarina and Cupressus. Water and salt stress treatments affected foliage tissue ion concentrations in all seedlings. N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Na, and Cl decreased as water stress level increased (except for, Na and Cl in Brazito soil). However, Ca, Mg, Na and Cl ion concentrations increased as the salinity level in the irrigation water increased. N and P decreased with increasing salinity and K was selectively accumulated. The seedlings' health declined with increasing stress treatment level. NaCl treatments caused foliar injury, which increased as the concentration of NaCl in the irrigation water increased. Thuja showed the least injury followed by Casuarina. Mortality was limited to Cupressus seedlings on both soil types. More mortality was noted with the increase in irrigation frequency and salinity level of the irrigation water. Thuja and Casuarina seedlings survived to the highest salinity level (8000 ppm NaCl), but with visible injury. Soil types affected all seedlings morphological parameters, total water potential, and foliage ion concentrations, except for P and Ca. All seedlings (except for Casuarina root dry weight) planted in Pima soil maintained higher growth and better overall health condition than on Brazito soil. Also, total water potential reached lower values in all species planted in Brazito soil rather than on Pima soil. Foliage Na and Cl concentrations on Brazito soil exceeded those on Pima soil. Survival of Cupressus seedlings was less on Brazito soil than on Pima soil. Overall, Cupressus growth was reduced the most on Brazito soil as compared with Pima soil. Growth of Casuarina was the least adversely affected on Brazito soil...|$|E
