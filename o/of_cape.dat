5|$|A {{cold front}} moved off the East Coast of the United States on July 16 and stalled {{off the coast}} of North Carolina. It {{gradually}} decayed into a surface low pressure trough, and developed into two disturbances; one was centered 290miles (490km) south-southeast <b>of</b> <b>Cape</b> Cod and another was located 200miles (320km) south <b>of</b> <b>Cape</b> Hatteras, North Carolina. The first low quickly organized into an unnamed tropical storm, and the other area initially remained broad and ill-defined. However, by July 18, the system became much better organized with improved banding features, and the area developed into Tropical Depression Two while located 220miles (355km) south-southeast <b>of</b> <b>Cape</b> Hatteras.|$|E

5|$|A large {{tropical}} wave {{emerged into}} the Atlantic Ocean {{from the west}} coast of Africa, on September7. The system passed south <b>of</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde on September8, with disorganized showers and thunderstorms. Around that time, the National Hurricane Center gave the system a medium chance of tropical cyclogenesis within 48hours. A low pressure area developed along the axis of the tropical wave on September9, which caused convective activity to increase further. The system was assessed with a high chance for tropical cyclone formation on September10. Based on satellite intensity estimates, the National Hurricane Center declared the disturbance as Tropical Depression Fourteen at 1200UTC on September10, while located about 885miles (1,425km) west <b>of</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde.|$|E

5|$|During mid-May, {{a frontal}} {{boundary}} stalled near The Bahamas and slowly degenerated. On May25, a shortwave trough caused the northern {{portion of the}} system to move north of the Bahamas. The following day, an {{area of low pressure}} developed along the boundary about 290miles (465km) south-southwest of Wilmington, North Carolina. Tracking towards the north, the system became increasingly organized. On May27, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) began issuing Tropical Weather Outlooks for the low while it was located about 120miles (195km) south <b>of</b> <b>Cape</b> Hatteras, North Carolina. An upper-level ridge situated to the southeast of the system was steering it towards the northeast. The NHC issued their final outlook on the low around 0000UTC on May28 while the system was located about 90mi (150km) east <b>of</b> <b>Cape</b> Hatteras, North Carolina, as development of the low was not expected.|$|E

5|$|On October10, 1984, the Government <b>of</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde {{appealed for}} {{international}} assistance. Emergency relief aid requested included: two-month {{supply of food}} for 1,124families, 1,064mattresses, 532kerosene stoves, 2,128sets of dinner ware, 2,128mugs, 1,064cooking pots and pans, 532water buckets, 2,128sheets, 1,064blankets, 2,660articles of clothing, and building materials for repair of the 1,094houses. In January1985, the government <b>of</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde announced that they had made significant progress with relief assistance. However, repairs to roads, infrastructure, and crops were still required. Five organizations contributed cash, including the National Solidarity Movement, the Cape Verde Red Cross, Chinese Red Cross, Oxfam Novib, and Oxfam of the United Kingdom; donations collectively totaled to $172,221 (1984USD). France, Finland, the Soviet Union, and the United States supplied 4000tons of cereals, $79,000 (1984USD) to the Red Cross, $250,000 (1984USD) for home repairs, 32packages of medicines, and 17packages of blankets.|$|E
5|$|While passing {{southeast}} <b>of</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde, {{the storm}} produced torrential rainfall. At least 1,094houses were severely damaged due to flooding, which left at least 2,100people homeless. Significant damage also occurred to {{roads in the}} country, which was still in need of repairs as late as January1985. The hydraulic infrastructure was destroyed on six islands, requiring $1million (1984USD) in repairs. In addition, agriculture was extensively damaged, resulting in $1.84million (1984USD) in losses to crops. The storm caused no impact outside <b>of</b> <b>Cape</b> Verde. Overall, the storm caused about $2.84million (1984USD) in damage and between 29 and 32fatalities. Several organizations and countries donated to disaster relief funds, which cash amounts alone reaching slightly more than $501,000 (1984USD).|$|E
5|$|A {{cold-core low}} which {{affected}} the latter stages of Josephine {{developed at the}} surface and became a subtropical storm on October 6, about 875mi (1,408.1km) southeast <b>of</b> <b>Cape</b> Race, Newfoundland. The subtropical storm moved southwest and slowly curved westward, nearly intensifying into a hurricane. On October 11, the subtropical storm finally acquired tropical characteristics. Simultaneously, the now-tropical cyclone intensified into a hurricane, and was re-classified as Hurricane Lili. After becoming a hurricane, Lili headed rapidly west-southwestward, and did not intensify past maximum sustained winds of 75mph (120km/h). After passing 140mi (230km) south of Bermuda later that day, Lili began to curve slowly northward, thereby avoiding landfall in the United States. While about 200mi (321.9km) east-southeast <b>of</b> <b>Cape</b> Hatteras, Lili weakened back to tropical storm intensity. Weakening to a tropical storm, Lili curved northeastward and accelerated toward Atlantic Canada. However, Lili transitioned into an extratropical storm on October 14, just offshore of Nova Scotia. The post-tropical cyclone made landfall on Newfoundland soon afterwards.|$|E

5|$|A {{moderately}} strong hurricane with {{winds of}} 105mph (165km/h) was first spotted on October 6 east of Jamaica. Passing {{a short distance}} south of the island, the hurricane tracked northwestward and brushed the Yucatán Peninsula before turning north-northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on October 9, it made landfall a short distance east of Apalachicola, Florida at peak winds with an estimated pressure of 969mbar. Rapidly weakening to tropical storm status, the cyclone continued northeastward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina on October 11. Later that day, it was last observed about 250mi (400km) southeast <b>of</b> <b>Cape</b> Cod.|$|E
5|$|A surface trough of low {{pressure}} with {{an area of}} convection persisted off the southeast coast of the United States on September 18.

Barbara moved over the Outer Banks, passing between Morehead City and Ocracoke, and it turned and accelerated to the northeast. Steadily weakening and losing tropical characteristics, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on August15. It turned northward, crossing eastern Nova Scotia and dissipating over Labrador on August16.|$|E
