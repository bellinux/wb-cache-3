40|$|This {{research}} explores {{methods to}} improve code <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> effectiveness. Misconduct {{is a common}} phenomenon in the business environment, {{even in the face}} of increased regulation, and the adoption <b>of</b> codes <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> by organisations. This impacts negatively on organisations’ reputations, results in financial loss, and has a negative impact on the sustainability of businesses. While researchers suggest that codes <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> should reduce misconduct and improve the ethical culture of organisations, mixed research results suggest codes <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> are not always effective. While research into code <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> effectiveness proliferates, seldom does such research take a holistic approach to understanding effectiveness <b>of</b> codes <b>of</b> <b>conduct.</b> Models proposed to better research code <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> effectiveness, such as Kaptein and Schwartz’ (2008) integrated research model, do not present guidelines for better developing and implementing codes <b>of</b> <b>conduct.</b> Therefore the primary research objective was to develop a benchmarking framework which could provide insight into factors that could influence code <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> effectiveness, and provide guidelines on how these factors should be influenced and accounted for to improve code <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> effectiveness. Content <b>of</b> codes <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> can play an important part in code <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> effectiveness, yet they vary enormously in terms of provisions, language, tone, style, design. Some are directional or rules based, others aspirational, or values based. Bettcher, Deshpandé, Margolis and Paine (2005) developed the Global Business Standards Codex that depicted the most commonly found provisions in organisations they surveyed. A secondary research objective was therefore to apply this codex to the evaluation of participating organisations codes <b>of</b> <b>conduct,</b> and in so doing, evaluate the suitability of the codex as a benchmarking framework for the content of the code <b>of</b> <b>conduct.</b> Adopting a grounded theory methodological approach and code <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> content analysis, the researcher investigated nine of South Africa’s largest multinational organisations in order to understand the factors influencing their code <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> effectiveness better. The research makes a significant contribution to the understanding <b>of</b> codes <b>of</b> <b>conduct,</b> their effectiveness, and provides practical guidelines on improving their effectiveness. This is achieved by 1) presenting nine formulae for an effective code of conduct; 2) detailing a multi-dimensional model that can facilitate the effectiveness of codes of conduct; and 3) improving the codex developed by Bettcher et al. (2005) on the content <b>of</b> codes <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> with the proposed code <b>of</b> <b>conduct</b> architecture criterion...|$|R

40|$|The EAAB (Estate Agency Affairs Board), a {{statutory}} {{body for}} the South African real estate industry, introduced an extensive Code <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> in 1992. The research conducted will serve to determine whether this Code <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> is effective in ensuring ethical behaviour by real estate agents. Both qualitative and quantitative research was undertaken, whereby {{it was determined that}} there is indeed a level of unethical behaviour amongst real estate agents, that a majority of such agents were unable to interpret specific clauses in the Code <b>of</b> <b>Conduct,</b> {{and that there was no}} clear correlation between support for the Code <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> and moral intent. Qualitative interviews highlighted the various roles that stakeholders do and should play in training and enforcement of the Code <b>of</b> <b>Conduct,</b> and their insights helped provide the basis for recommendations to the Estate Agency Affairs Board on improving the effectiveness of the EAAB Code <b>of</b> <b>Conduct.</b> Key recommendations to the EAAB were that a revision of the Code <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> was needed, entry requirements into the industry should be more stringent, a professional image for the industry should be promoted, and improved communication between the EAAB and stakeholders, improved enforcement and higher penalties, and an extensive training and education programme on Ethics and the Code <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> were needed. A Ten Element Model for an Effective Code <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> was proposed that detailed ten key themes arising from the research which could also be applicable in other industries. The forces and importance of communication, debate and consultation between society and industry, through regulatory bodies and/or professional associations provided the foundation for the development and revision of the Code <b>of</b> <b>Conduct.</b> To ensure effectiveness, the Code <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> needed to be supported by an ethical culture, professionalisation of the industry, support and understanding of the Code <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> by stakeholders, exposure, education and training on the Code <b>of</b> <b>Conduct</b> and Ethics, enforcement, penalties and consumer education...|$|R

5|$|A {{magnetostrictive}} material is one which changes shape when {{a magnetic field}} is applied. In reverse, it produces a magnetic field when distorted. The magnetostrictive transducer requires a coil <b>of</b> <b>conducting</b> wire around the {{magnetostrictive material}}. The coil either induces a magnetic field in the transducer and sets it in motion or else picks up an induced current from {{the motion of the}} transducer at the filter output. It is also usually necessary to have a small magnet to bias the magnetostrictive material into its operating range. It is possible to dispense with the magnets if the biasing is taken care of on the electronic side by providing a d.c. current superimposed on the signal, but this approach would detract from the generality of the filter design.|$|E

5|$|After the {{demotion}} of Malenkov, Khrushchev and Molotov initially {{worked together}} well, and the longtime foreign minister even proposed that Khrushchev, not Bulganin, replace Malenkov as premier. However, Khrushchev and Molotov increasingly differed on policy. Molotov opposed the Virgin Lands policy, instead proposing heavy investment to increase yields in developed agricultural areas, which Khrushchev felt was not feasible {{due to a}} lack of resources and a lack of a sophisticated farm labor force. The two differed on foreign policy as well; soon after Khrushchev took power, he sought a peace treaty with Austria, which would allow Soviet troops then in occupation of part of the country to leave. Molotov was resistant, but Khrushchev arranged for an Austrian delegation to come to Moscow and negotiate the treaty. Although Khrushchev and other Presidium members attacked Molotov at a Central Committee meeting in mid-1955, accusing him <b>of</b> <b>conducting</b> a foreign policy which turned the world against the USSR, Molotov remained in his position.|$|E
