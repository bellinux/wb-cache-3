Deoiled Laminaria japonica was collected by supercritical carbon dioxide (SCO 2) extraction process. Experiments were performed in a batch-type reactor with stirring.

The present investigation was undertaken to determine the availability of carbohydrates in hydrolysates derived from different substrates Acacia arabica, Delbergia sisso, Peltophorum Pterocarpur and Perkia biglobosa pods, {{in the production of}} ethanol. The enzymatic hydrolysis of the substrates has yielded the significant amount <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> sugar from the substrates by comparing the effect of enzymes on hydrolysis. The Acacia arabica pods has showed the higher production <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> sugars when treated with 4 % a-amylase whereas Peltophorum pterocarpum has produced lowest yield <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> sugar at 4 % a-amylase enzyme. The optimum temperature required for the activity of a-amylase enzyme in the production <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> sugars using different substrates were revealed that at 30 oC the Acacia arabica has yielded maximum sugars whereas the Perkia biglobosa has showed the minimum yield <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> sugar. The optimum period of enzyme activity in the production <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> sugars using different substrates was indicted that the Acacia arabica has showed the maximum yield <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> sugars during the incubation period of 24 hours whereas minimum yield was observed in Perkia biglobosa.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the acid and enzymatic hydrolysis of cassava bagasse for the recovery <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> sugars and to establish the operational costs. A statistical program "Statistica", based on the surface response was used to optimize the recovery <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> sugars in both the processes. The process economics was determined considering the values <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> sugars obtained at laboratory scale, and the operations costs of a cylindrical reactor of 1500 L, with flat walls {{at the top and}} bottom. The reactor was operated with 150 kg of cassava bagasse and 1350 kg of water. The yield of the acid hydrolysis was 62. 4 g <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> sugars from 100 g of cassava bagasse containing 66 % starch. It represented 94. 5 % <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> sugar recovery. The yield of the enzymatic hydrolysis was 77. 1 g <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> sugars from 120 g of cassava bagasse, which represented 97. 3 % <b>of</b> <b>reducing</b> sugars recovery. Concerning to the time, a batch of acid hydrolysis required 10 minutes, plus the time to heat and cool the reactor, and a batch of the enzymatic hydrolysis needed 25 hours and 20 minutes, plus the time to heat and to cool the reactor. Thus, the acid hydrolysis of 150 kg of cassava bagasse required US$ 34. 27, and the enzymatic hydrolysis of the same amount of cassava bagasse required US$ 2470. 99...|$|R

5|$|During {{and after}} World War II, the Yehudi lights project {{developed}} counter-illumination camouflage using lamps {{to increase the}} brightness of the aircraft to match {{the brightness of the}} sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colors, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage at the price <b>of</b> <b>reduced</b> flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapor contrails.|$|E
