5|$|During {{the rule}} of the Aryacakravarti rulers, the laws {{governing}} the society was based on a compromise between a matriarchal system <b>of</b> <b>society</b> <b>that</b> seemed to have had deeper roots overlaid with a patriarchal system of governance. These laws seemed to have existed side by side as customary laws to be interpreted by the local Mudaliars. In some aspects such as in inheritance the similarity to Marumakattayam law of present-day Kerala and Aliyasanatana of modern Tulunadu was noted by later scholars. Further Islamic jurisprudence and Hindu laws of neighboring India also seemed to have affected the customary laws. These customary laws were later codified and put to print during the Dutch colonial rule as Thesavalamai in 1707. The rule under earlier customs seemed to have been females succeeded females. But when the structure of the society came to be based on patriarchal system, a corresponding rule was recognized, that males succeeded males. Thus, we see the devolution of muthusam (paternal inheritance) was on the sons, and the devolution of the chidenam (dowry or maternal inheritance) was on the females. Just as one dowried sister succeeded another, we had the corresponding rule that if one’s brother died instate, his properties devolved upon his brothers to the exclusion of his sisters. The reason being that in a patriarchal family each brother formed a family unit, but all the brothers being agnates, when one of them died his property devolved upon his agnates.|$|E

Major {{difficulties with}} the stabilization and reform programs were caused {{in part by the}} superficial nature of many of the administration's actions and by its inability to secure political support. Moreover, the stabilization plan failed because of management errors coupled with defensive actions by segments <b>of</b> <b>society</b> <b>that</b> would be most directly hurt by the plan. Confidence in the government was also eroded {{as a result of the}} liquidity freeze combined with an alienated industrial sector who had not been consulted in the plan.|$|E
25|$|The Red Flag riots were {{a series}} of violent demonstrations and attacks that {{occurred}} in Brisbane, Australia {{over the course of}} 1918–19. The attacks were largely undertaken by returned soldiers from the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF) and were focused upon socialists and other elements <b>of</b> <b>society</b> <b>that</b> the ex-servicemen considered to be disloyal. The name was coined because of the flags that a number of the demonstrators carried, which were associated with the trade union movement and which were banned under the War Precautions Act. The most notable incident occurred on 24 March 1919, when a crowd of about 8,000 ex-servicemen clashed with police who were preventing them from attacking the Russian Hall in Merivale Street, South Brisbane.|$|E

25|$|In 1888, a young Massachusetts writer named Edward Bellamy {{published}} {{a work of}} utopian fiction entitled , telling the Rip Van Winkle-like tale of a 19th-century New England capitalist who awoke from a deep slumber to find a completely changed society in the far-distant year of 2000. In Bellamy's tale, a non-violent revolution had transformed the American economy and thereby society; private property had been abolished in favor of state ownership of capital {{and the elimination of}} social classes and the ills <b>of</b> <b>society</b> <b>that</b> he thought inevitably followed from them. In the new world of the year 2000, there was no longer war, poverty, crime, prostitution, corruption, money, or taxes.

25|$|Mehmet Osman was conceptualised by {{the creators}} of EastEnders, Tony Holland and Julia Smith. Mehmet, the brother of {{original}} character Ali Osman (Nejdet Salih), {{was part of a}} well-intentioned attempt to represent the proportion of Turkish Cypriots who had immigrated to England and settled in the East End of London. Holland and Smith knew that for the soap to succeed there needed to be a varied group of characters, so that several different sections of the audience had someone to identify with. Additionally, if the programme was to be realistic, it had to reflect the cross-section <b>of</b> <b>society</b> <b>that</b> actually existed in the real location. For these reasons, different sexes, ages, classes, religions and races were all included in the original character line-up. Both Holland and Smith had {{been at the forefront of}} the move towards 'integrated casting' in television and had encountered an array of ethnic diversities in the process. Even though the ethnic minority groups were deemed the hardest to research, Holland and Smith called upon their social contacts to relay information about their own origins and lifestyles, which they say allowed them to portray Walford's most recent immigrants more realistically.|$|E

500|$|The {{secularization}} <b>of</b> <b>society</b> <b>that</b> began during The Enlightenment questioned {{traditional religious}} attitudes toward suicide {{and brought a}} more modern perspective to the issue. David Hume denied that suicide was a crime as it affected no one and was potentially {{to the advantage of}} the individual. In his 1777 Essays on Suicide and the Immortality of the Soul he rhetorically asked, [...] "Why should I prolong a miserable existence, because of some frivolous advantage which the public may perhaps receive from me?" [...] A shift in public opinion at large can also be discerned; The Times in 1786 initiated a spirited debate on the motion [...] "Is suicide an act of courage?".|$|E

By this time Lang's identification with the poor had largely vanished, as had his interest in social reform. In the Church Assembly his closest ally was the aristocratic Lord Hugh Cecil; Hastings maintains that the Church of England in the 1930s was controlled [...] "less by Lang and Temple in tandem than by Lang and Hugh Cecil". [...] Lang got on well with Hewlett Johnson, the pro-communist priest who was appointed Dean of Canterbury in 1931.|$|E

500|$|In Kohlberg's {{empirical}} studies of individuals throughout their life Kohlberg observed that some had apparently undergone moral stage regression. [...] This could be resolved either by allowing for moral regression or by extending the theory. Kohlberg chose the latter, postulating {{the existence of}} sub-stages in which the emerging stage {{has not yet been}} fully integrated into the personality. In particular Kohlberg noted a stage 4½ or 4+, a transition from stage four to stage five, that shared characteristics of both. In this stage the individual is disaffected with the arbitrary nature of law and order reasoning; culpability is frequently turned from being defined by society to viewing society itself as culpable. This stage is often mistaken for the moral relativism of stage two, as the individual views those interests <b>of</b> <b>society</b> <b>that</b> conflict with their own as being relatively and morally wrong. Kohlberg noted that this was often observed in students entering college.|$|E
500|$|As German film {{professor}} Anton Kaes wrote, [...] "The {{style of}} German Expressionism allowed the filmmakers {{to experiment with}} filmic technology and special effects and to explore the twisted realm of repressed desires, unconscious fears, and deranged fixations". The visual style of Caligari conveys a sense of anxiety and terror to the viewer, giving {{the impression of a}} nightmare or deranged sensibility, or a place transformed by evil, in a more effective way than realistic locations or conventional design concepts could. Siegfried Kracauer wrote that the settings [...] "amounted to a perfect transformation of material objects into emotional ornaments". The majority of the film's story and scenes are memories recalled by an insane narrator, and as a result the distorted visual style takes on the quality of his mental breakdown, giving the viewers the impression that they are inside the mind of a madman. As with German Expressionist paintings, the visual style of Caligari reflects an emotional reaction to world, {{and in the case of}} the film's characters represents an emotional response to the terror <b>of</b> <b>society</b> <b>that</b> Dr. Caligari and Cesare represent. Often in the film, set pieces are emblematic of the emotional state of the characters in the scene. For example, the courtyard of the insane asylum during the frame story is vastly out of proportion. The characters seem too big for the small building, and the courtyard floor features a bizarre pattern, all of which represent the patients' damaged frames of mind. Likewise, the scene with the criminal in a prison cell features a set with long vertical painted shadows resembling arrowheads, pointing down at the squatting prisoner in an oppressive effect that symbolizes his broken-down state.|$|E
