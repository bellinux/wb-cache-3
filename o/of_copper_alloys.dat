25|$|As an {{alternative}} to organotin toxins, there has been renewed interest in copper as the active agent in ablative or self polishing paints, with reported service lives up to 5 years. Modern adhesives permit application <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> to steel hulls without creating galvanic corrosion. However, copper alone is not impervious to diatom and algae fouling. Some studies indicate that copper may also present an unacceptable environmental impact.|$|E
25|$|Copper–zinc brass alloys are {{currently}} (2011) being deployed in commercial-scale aquaculture operations in Asia, South America and the US (Hawaii). Extensive research, including demonstrations and trials, {{are currently}} being implemented on two other copper alloys: copper-nickel and copper-silicon. Each of these alloy types has an inherent ability to reduce biofouling, pen waste, disease, {{and the need for}} antibiotics while simultaneously maintaining water circulation and oxygen requirements. Other types <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> are also being considered for research and development in aquaculture operations.|$|E
25|$|In {{the marine}} environment, the antimicrobial/algaecidal {{properties}} <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> prevent biofouling, which can briefly {{be described as}} the undesirable accumulation, adhesion, and growth of microorganisms, plants, algae, tube worms, barnacles, mollusks, and other organisms on man-made marine structures. By inhibiting microbial growth, copper alloy aquaculture pens avoid the need for costly net changes that are necessary with other materials. The resistance of organism growth on copper alloy nets also provides a cleaner and healthier environment for farmed fish to grow and thrive.|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{corrosion}} property <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> {{tubes in}} seawater has been investigated. Three <b>copper</b> <b>alloys</b> <b>of</b> nominal composition Cu- 20 Zn- 2 Al(Al-Brass), Cu- 30 Ni(CN 70 / 30) and Cu- 10 Ni(CN 90 / 10) were con-sidered.

Corrosion rate <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> tubes in 3 %NaCl flowing solution was investigated by weight-loss measurements and electrochemical test. The CN 70 / 30 showed lowest corrosion rate among three <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> tubes.

CN 70 / 30 showed partly pitting problem on the surface owing to high Fe content, even though having high resistant against corrosion.

40|$|Abstract. Cu-matrix bearing {{materials}} were prepared by powder metallurgy method and their mechanical properties were studied in present work. The continuity <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> matrix was destroyed {{with the increase}} of Bi element. Because Bi is brittle phase and distributed in the <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> matrix grain boundaries as thin ribbon network. The hardness, crushing strength and impact toughness of copper-{{bearing materials}} were reduced with increase of the content of Bi. The mainly of Copper-bearing materials containing bismuth fracture are brittle intergranular fracture. When the Bi content is over 4 wt%, the Bi has a relatively full distribution in the rich Bi phase <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> <b>alloy</b> matrix grain boundary like a chip mesh belt. As the further increase of Bi, the reduced trends of the mechanical properties of Cu-matrix bearing materials containing bismuth are slow down. because the role <b>of</b> fragmented <b>Copper</b> <b>alloy</b> matrix will not significantly increase with further increase of Bi...|$|R

25|$|It is the {{combination}} {{of all of these}} properties – antifouling, high strength, and corrosion resistance – that has made copper alloys a desirable material for such marine applications as condenser tubing, water intake screens, ship hulls, offshore structure, and sheathing.

2500|$|The {{antimicrobial}} properties <b>of</b> <b>copper</b> {{are still}} under active investigation.

25|$|Antimicrobial {{copper alloy}} touch {{surfaces}} are surfaces {{that are made}} from the metal copper or alloys of copper, such as brass and bronze. Copper and copper alloys have a natural ability to kill harmful microbes relatively rapidly - often within two hours or less (i.e. copper alloy surfaces are antimicrobial). Much of the antimicrobial efficacy work pertaining to copper has been or is currently being conducted at the University of Southampton and Northumbria University (United Kingdom), University of Stellenbosch (South Africa), Panjab University (India), University of Chile (Chile), Kitasato University (Japan), the Instituto do Mar and University of Coimbra (Portugal), and the University of Nebraska and Arizona State University (U.S.).
