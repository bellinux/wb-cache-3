50|$|AC {{amplifiers}} can use bootstrapping {{to increase}} <b>output</b> <b>swing.</b> A capacitor (usually referred as bootstrap capacitor) is connected from {{the output of}} the amplifier to the bias circuit, providing bias voltages that exceed the power supply voltage. Emitter followers can provide rail-to-rail output in this way, which is a common technique in class AB audio amplifiers.|$|E
5000|$|An {{amplifier}} {{may have}} an asymmetrical <b>output</b> <b>swing,</b> perhaps because a transistor is biased so its collector voltage is not half the supply voltage (or the [...] "balanced" [...] power supply rails aren't perfectly balanced); clipping may begin earlier on {{one half of the}} output waveform. Bootstrapping or a redesign of the circuit may alleviate this when it is caused by difficulties in driving emitter follower output stages.|$|E
50|$|As a {{consequence}} of this relation, the voltage drop across the resistor {{is tied to the}} current at the Q-point. If the bias current is fixed for some performance reason, any increase in load resistance automatically leads to a lower voltage for Vout. which in turn lowers the voltage drop VCB between collector and base, limiting the signal swing at the amplifier output (if the <b>output</b> <b>swing</b> is larger than VCB, the transistor is driven out of active mode during part of the signal cycle).|$|E

The device is especially useful in Digital Video Broadcasting applications; for this application, since the system is polarity free, each output {{can be used as}} an independent driver. The driver boasts a gain of approximately 40 and produces <b>output</b> <b>swings</b> twice as large as a standard ECL output. When driving a coaxial cable, proper termination is required {{at both ends of the}} line to minimize signal loss. The 1. 6 V <b>output</b> <b>swings</b> allow for termination at both ends of the cable, while maintaining the required 800 mV swing at the receiving end of the cable.

5000|$|The SVT amps with 6146B tubes tend {{to put out}} a {{bit more}} watts of power as well as have a more {{pronounced}} grind in low mids that makes these amps desirable for some bass players. The 6550A version of SVT amps tends to have a more rounder deeper bass sound.. Mainly due to the output transformer primary inductance with respect to plate resistance..The 6146 is much lower in transconductance and is less sensitive to drive signal, thus needs a bigger voltage swing to drive than a 6550... another reason the 6146 amps have more growl than its 6550 counterpart is because the pre-amp is turned up a bit higher to achieve the equivalent power <b>output</b> <b>swing,</b> thus more [...] "grind" [...] (fuzz bass) can be obtained from the preamp.|$|E
50|$|For voltage amplification, {{the range}} of allowed output voltage swing in this {{amplifier}} is tied to voltage gain when a resistor load RC is employed, as in Figure 1. That is, large voltage gain requires large RC, and that in turn implies a large DC voltage drop across RC. For a given supply voltage, the larger this drop, the smaller the transistor VCB and the less <b>output</b> <b>swing</b> is allowed before saturation of the transistor occurs, with resultant distortion of the output signal. To avoid this situation, an active load can be used, for example, a current mirror. If this choice is made, the value of RC in the table above is replaced by the small-signal output resistance of the active load, which is generally at least {{as large as the}} rO of the active transistor in Figure 1. On the other hand, the DC voltage drop across the active load has a fixed low value (the compliance voltage of the active load), much less than the DC voltage drop incurred for comparable gain using a resistor RC. That is, an active load imposes less restriction on the output voltage swing. Notice that active load or not, large AC gain still is coupled to large AC output resistance, which leads to poor voltage division at the output except for large loads RL ≫ Rout.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, we {{describe}} a novel low-voltage class-AB operational amplifier (opamp) based on dynamic threshold voltage MOS transistors (DTMOS). A DTMOS tran-sistor is a device whose gate {{is tied to}} its bulk. DTMOS tran-sistor pseudo-pMOS differential input pairs are used for input common-mode range enhancement, followed by a single ended class-AB output. Two versions of the proposed opamp (opamp-A and opamp-B) were fabricated in a standard 0. 18 - m CMOS process technology. Measurements under 5 pF and 10 k load conditions gave, for opamp-A, a DC open-loop gain of 50. 1 dB, and a unity gain bandwidth (GBW) of 26. 2 MHz. A common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 78 dB, and input and <b>output</b> <b>swings</b> of 0. 7 V and 0. 9 V, respectively, were achieved. Opamp-B has been optimized for biomedical applications, and is implemented to build the analog front-end part of a near-infrared spectroreflectometry (NIRS) receiver of a multi-wavelength wireless brain oxymeter apparatus. A DC open-loop gain of 53 dB, a GBW of 1. 3 MHz, and input and <b>output</b> <b>swings</b> of 0. 6 V and 0. 8 V, respectively, were measured.
