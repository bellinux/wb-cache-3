In June 2005, Whibley {{proposed}} to her. The couple married on 15 July 2006 in Montecito, California. On 9 October 2009, Lavigne filed for divorce, releasing the statement, [...] "I am grateful for <b>our</b> <b>time</b> <b>together,</b> and I am grateful and blessed for our remaining friendship."

500|$|On September 26, 2016, {{the band}} {{revealed}} that the latest album {{that had previously been}} promised to fans would not be released in 2016. The band felt that the songs on the album were incomplete and needed more time to be deemed finalized. The band also announced that it would be celebrating the 10-year anniversary of The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me by playing it in its entirety the remainder of the tour. There also were more statements alluding to the band's end: [...] "What’s left should be a strange demise, but hopefully one as loud and as fun as the rest of <b>our</b> <b>time</b> <b>together</b> has been. All are invited. Please send flowers." ...|$|E
500|$|Manson {{stated that}} {{eliminating}} the corporate pressure and indifference, {{as well as}} the band having a relaxed approach to the making of the record was pivotal for a healthy regroup, writing and recording process. [...] "We didn't put any pressure on ourselves to finish an album... We just took our time and got together in two-week blocks of time - any longer than that I'm sure we would have started getting on each others' nerves. So we did two weeks and then we'd take some time off and then when everybody felt ready we'd get back in [...] again. As a result, I think everybody really enjoyed <b>our</b> <b>time</b> <b>together</b> and really plugged in", she remarked. Never much enjoying being in a studio, Manson relished the record-making process this time around.|$|E

Betty Buckley, Van Patten's co-star on the series, recalled, [...] "Every day on the set he was a happy, jovial person, always generous and ready to play, tease, and always keep us all laughing.

I am fully six years older,--I have lived through another life since I knew you at Cossethay. I wonder if you would care to see me. I shall come up to Derby next week, and I would call in Nottingham, and we might have tea together. Will you let me know? I shall look for your answer.|$|R

[...] He developed a very close relationship with painter Salvador Dalí and poet Federico García Lorca, among other important Spanish creative artists living in the Residencia de Estudiantes, with the three friends forming {{the nucleus of the}} Spanish Surrealist avant-garde, [...] and becoming known as members of [...] "La Generación del 27". Buñuel was especially taken with Lorca, later writing in his autobiography: [...] "We liked each other instantly. [...] Although we seemed to have little in common—I was a redneck from Aragon, and he an elegant Andalusian—we spent most of <b>our</b> <b>time</b> <b>together...</b> We used to sit on the grass in the evenings behind the Residencia (at that time, there were vast open spaces reaching to the horizon), and he would read me his poems. He read slowly and beautifully, and through him I began to discover a wholly new world." [...] Buñuel's relationship with Dalí was somewhat more troubled, being tinged with jealousy over the growing intimacy between Dalí and Lorca and resentment over Dalí's early success as an artist.|$|E

40|$|Thinking about Martin Stokhof as a friend, I am {{reminded}} of our pleasant get-togethers to discuss the meaning of life, {{and the art of}} living it, of our fruitful collaboration in writing a overview of dynamic logic, and of <b>our</b> <b>times</b> <b>together</b> at the Aikido club of Eric Louw. Thinking about Martin Stokhof as a philosopher and colleague, his formal analysis (together with Jeroen Groenendijk) of questions and question answering is the first thing that comes to mind. This work is part of a fruitful tradition that has recently spawned inquisitive semantics, and the focus on question answering in dynamic epistemic logic. The theme is still very much alive at ILLC today. Next, I {{am reminded}} of the dynamic turn in natural language semantics, of the way he and Jeroen Groenendijk criticized Hans Kamp’s ideas about discourse representation, and how this led to the invention of dynamic predicate logic. Later it became clear that dynamic predicate logic can be viewed as the action part of quantified dynamic logic, invented much earlier by David Harel. This led to a connection, a semanti...|$|R
60|$|Janie {{played the}} Fairy Godmamma {{in a white}} wig and panniers. She will make a {{beautiful}} old lady. The white hair gives her {{the one thing that}} she lacks: distinction. I found myself glancing apprehensively round the room, wishing we had not invited so many eligible bachelors. Dick is making me anxious. The sense of his own unworthiness, which has come to him quite suddenly, and apparently with all the shock of a new discovery, has completely unnerved him. It is a healthy sentiment, and does him good. But I do not want it carried to the length of losing her. The thought of what he might one day bring home has been a nightmare to me ever since he left school. I suppose it is to most fathers. Especially if one thinks of the women one loved oneself when in the early twenties. A large pale-faced girl, who served in a bun-shop in the Strand, is the first I can recollect. How I trembled when by chance her hand touched mine! I cannot recall a single attraction about her except her size, yet for nearly six months I lunched off pastry and mineral waters merely to be near her. To this very day an attack of indigestion will always recreate her image in my mind. Another was a thin, sallow girl, but with magnificent eyes, I met one afternoon in the South Kensington Museum. She was a brainless, vixenish girl, but the memory of her eyes would always draw me back to her. More than two- thirds of <b>our</b> <b>time</b> <b>together</b> we spent in violent quarrels; and all my hopes of eternity I would have given to make her my companion for life. But for Luck, {{in the shape of a}} well-to-do cab proprietor, as great an idiot as myself I might have done it. The third was a chorus girl: on the whole, the best of the bunch. Her father was a coachman, and she had ten brothers and sisters, most of them doing well in service. And she was succeeded--if I have the order correct- -by the ex-wife of a solicitor, a sprightly lady; according to her own account the victim of complicated injustice. I daresay there were others, if I took the time to think; but not one of them can I remember without returning thanks to Providence for having lost her. What is one to do? There are days in springtime when a young man ought not to be allowed outside the house. Thank Heaven and Convention it is not the girls who propose! Few women, who would choose the right moment to put their hands upon a young man's shoulders, and, looking into his eyes, ask him to marry them next week, would receive No for an answer. It is only our shyness that saves us. A wise friend of mine, who has observed much, would have all those marrying under five-and-twenty divorced by automatic effluxion of time at forty, leaving the few who had chosen satisfactorily to be reunited if they wished: his argument being that to condemn grown men and women to abide by the choice of inexperienced boys and girls is unjust and absurd. There were nice girls I could have fallen in love with. They never occurred to me. It would seem as if a man had to learn taste in women as in all other things, namely, by education. Here and there may exist the born connoisseur. But with most of us our first instincts are towards vulgarity. It is Barrie, I think, who says that if only there were silly women enough to go round, good women would never get a look in. It is certainly remarkable, the number of sweet old maids one meets. Almost as remarkable as the number of stupid, cross-grained wives. As I tell Dick, I have no desire for a daughter-in-law of whom he feels himself worthy. If he can't do better than that he had best remain single. Janie and he, if I know anything of life, are just suited for one another. Helpful people take their happiness in helping. I knew just such another, once: a sweet, industrious, sensible girl. She made the mistake of marrying a thoroughly good man. There was nothing for her to do. She ended by losing all interest in him, devoting herself to a Home in the East End for the reformation of newsboys. It was a pitiful waste: so many women would have been glad of him; while to the ordinary sinful man she would have been a life-long comfort. I must have a serious talk to Dick. I shall point out what a good thing it will be for her. I can see Dick keeping her busy and contented for the rest of her days.|$|E

Our 2003 - 16 optical photometry of the object during X-ray quiescence, obtained by 50 - 250 cm telescopes in Crimea, Caucasus Mountains and Slovakia, consists of ~ 7660 CCD frames in Johnson-Cousins $V,R,R_C,I$ bands and the integral light.
