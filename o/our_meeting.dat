[...] Matt Miller from Game Informer was impressed with the game, praising its Mass Effect-like speech and combat systems. He commented that [...] "we didn't go into <b>our</b> <b>meeting</b> for Pirates with great expectations, but came out pleasantly amazed at the potential of the game." [...] Joystiq's Mike Schramm compared the game to Fable, noting that [...] "what is there looks good– the combat was solid, if a little shallow, and the graphics and polish are well on their way." ...|$|E
500|$|The NBPA {{scheduled}} {{a meeting in}} New York City on January 6, where players would vote on the proposal by the owners, which the committee had recommended opposing. Several players, including Shaquille O'Neal and Hakeem Olajuwon, wanted the vote to be conducted by secret ballot, while others indicated a desire to return to competition regardless of how the vote went. Kevin Johnson stated that most players [...] "were just ready to [...] Wednesday at <b>our</b> <b>meeting</b> if an agreement hadn't been reached." [...] Faced with a splintering union, Hunter moved to resume talks with Stern. On January 6, the day before Stern's deadline, he and Hunter reached an agreement, which was ratified by the NBPA later that day and by the NBA Board of Governors on January 7.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the word}} used {{in all these}} writings, in {{particular}} the New Testament Greek word [...] (ouranos), applies primarily to the sky, it is also used metaphorically of the dwelling place of God and the blessed. Similarly, though the English word [...] "heaven" [...] still keeps its original physical meaning when used, for instance, in allusions to the stars as [...] "lights shining through from Heaven", and in phrases such as heavenly body to mean an astronomical object, the Heaven or happiness that Christianity looks forward to is, according to Pope John Paul II, [...] "neither an abstraction nor a physical place in the clouds, but a living, personal relationship with the Holy Trinity. It is <b>our</b> <b>meeting</b> with the Father which {{takes place in the}} risen Christ through the communion of the Holy Spirit." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1964, {{director}} Yuri Lyubimov invited Vysotsky to {{join the}} newly created Taganka Theatre. [...] "'I've written some songs of my own. Won't you listen?' – he asked. I agreed to listen to just one of them, expecting <b>our</b> <b>meeting</b> to last {{for no more than}} five minutes. Instead I ended up listening to him for an entire 1.5 hours," [...] Lyubimov remembered years later of this first audition. On 19 September 1964, Vysotsky debuted in Bertholt Brecht's The Good Person of Szechwan as the Second God (not to count two minor roles). A month later he came on stage as a dragoon captain (Bela's father) in Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time. It was in Taganka that Vysotsky started to sing on stage; the War theme becoming prominent in his musical repertoire. In 1965 Vysotsky appeared in the experimental Poet and Theater (Поэт и Театр, February) show, based on Andrey Voznesensky's work and then Ten Days that Shook the World (after John Reed's book, April) and was commissioned by Lyubimov to write songs exclusively for Taganka's new World War II play. The Dead and the Living (Павшие и Живые), premiered in October 1965, featured Vysotsky's [...] "Stars" [...] (Звёзды), [...] "The Soldiers of Heeresgruppe Mitte" [...] (Солдаты группы [...] "Центр") and [...] "Penal Battalions" [...] (Штрафные батальоны), the striking examples of a completely new kind of a war song, never heard in his country before. As veteran screenwriter Nikolay Erdman put it (in conversation with Lyubimov), [...] "Professionally, I can well understand how Mayakovsky or Seryozha Yesenin were doing it. How Volodya Vysotsky does it is totally beyond me." [...] With his songs – in effect, miniature theatrical dramatizations (usually with a protagonist and full of dialogues), Vysotsky instantly achieved such level of credibility that real life former prisoners, war veterans, boxers, footballers refused to believe that the author himself had never served his time in prisons and labor camps, or fought in the War, or been a boxing/football professional. After the second of the two concerts at the Leningrad Molecular Physics institute (that was his actual debut as a solo musical performer) Vysotsky left a note for his fans in a journal which ended with words: [...] "Now that you've heard all these songs, please, don't you make a mistake of mixing me with my characters, I am not like them at all. With love, Vysotsky, 20 April 1965, XX c." [...] Excuses of this kind he had to make throughout his performing career. At least one of Vysotsky's song themes – that of alcoholic abuse – was worryingly autobiographical, though. By the time his breakthrough came in 1967, he'd suffered several physical breakdowns and once was sent (by Taganka's boss) to a rehabilitation clinic, a visit he on several occasions repeated since.|$|E
