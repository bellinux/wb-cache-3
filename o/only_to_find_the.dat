Jones demanded to know why and was briefed by Lieutenant Eggleston that powder was low and precious and given Monitors resistance to shot after two hours of battle, maintained that continued firing at that point would only be a waste of ammunition. Virginia soon managed to break away and headed back towards Norfolk, believing that Monitor had withdrawn from battle. Greene, now in command, did not pursue Virginia and, like Worden, was under orders to stay with and protect Minnesota, an action for which he was later criticized.|$|E

5|$|Sing's {{reputation}} {{resulted in}} a champion Turkish sniper, nicknamed 'Abdul the Terrible' by the Allied side, being assigned to deal with him. Tate alleges that the Turks were largely able to distinguish Sing's sniping from that of other ANZAC soldiers, and that only the reports of incidents believed to be Sing's work were passed on to Abdul. Through analysis of the victims' actions and wounds, Abdul concluded that Sing's position was at Chatham's Post. After several days, Sing's spotter alerted him to a potential target, and he took aim, <b>only</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>the</b> target—Abdul—looking in his direction. Sing prepared to fire, trying not to reveal his position, but the Turkish sniper noticed him and began his own firing sequence. Sing fired first and killed Abdul.

Sharon, refusing to believe Derek, kicks him out of their house, and he moves into a separate apartment. Months later, Derek and Sharon meet up for dinner and finally reconcile.

Harry figures out from hints Aragog dropped that a student who died during the previous attacks is Myrtle, and when Ginny is apparently taken by the monster into the Chamber, they discover that the entrance is in the bathroom they’ve been using to make Polyjuice Potion. Harry, Ron, and Lockhart enter the Chamber, but the dunderheaded professor (who reveals that he’s a fraud) causes a rockfall upon attempt to modify the boys’ memories with Ron’s damaged wand, and Harry must enter alone. He arrives to find Ginny in a weakened state being watched over by a shadowy, ghostly Riddle, who explains {{that he is not}} only the heir of Slytherin, but also grew up to become Voldemort himself, before setting the basilisk upon Harry; Harry defeats the monster, with the help of Dumbledore's Phoenix, and the Sword of Gryffindor drawn from the Sorting Hat, and destroys the diary, which makes Riddle disappear.|$|E
