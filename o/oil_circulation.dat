50|$|Refrigerant {{may also}} explain flash-gas occurrence. When a system lacks refrigerant, {{or has a}} leakage, it may exhibit flash-gas as the volume in the piping exceeds the {{capacity}} of the refrigerant to fill it as liquid. This may force the refrigerant into a phase change. On the other hand, lack of refrigerant can sometimes also produce the opposite effect: an overall increase on the subcooling (and superheating) which will depend on the size and design of the system and its piping. If the system’s refrigerant is degenerate, flash-gas may also be produced, as physical properties of the fluid change. This happens because the piping is designed for a specific refrigerant mixture that allows liquid in the liquid line, given certain thermodynamic conditions. If the refrigerant mixture changes its composition considerably, the original designs will not be adequate. Degenerated refrigerant produced by leakage, chemical decomposition or loading with gas when using a glided refrigerant; will most likely make the system perform very poorly, alter <b>oil’s</b> <b>circulation</b> or composition, and may eventually render gear inoperative.|$|R
40|$|The Internal Heat Exchanger (IHX) {{is widely}} {{known for its}} {{potential}} to improve the performance of air conditioning systems. Â The adoption of alternative, more environmentally friendly, refrigerants such as R 744 has brought elevated attention to IHX development due to relatively large performance increases from IHX usage compared to conventional refrigerants. Â In addition, the increasing need for even small incremental improvements in systems using conventional refrigerants has driven the expanded {{development and implementation of}} IHXs. Â The focus of this study is the quantification and comparison of the performance of internal heat exchangers and the effects of location of measurements and <b>oil</b> in <b>circulation</b> rates on the measurement accuracy and actual IHX performance. Â Typical IHX performance measurements yield the heat exchanger capacity, effectiveness, and the refrigerant pressure drop across each side of the heat exchanger. Â Existing test standards vary widely on the required test conditions, allowable <b>oil</b> in <b>circulation</b> rates, and instrument locations. Â The goal of comparison testing is of course to accurately quantify performance while also achieving repeatable results which allow for a fair and useful comparison between IHXs. Â Test conditions and temperature measurement location can have a large effect on both the accuracy and repeatability of measurements. Â Conditions close to the saturation dome, i. e. low subcooling or superheat, can make it difficult to accurately determine and control the state point. Â Thermal stratification across the cross section of the IHX tubes can also lead to measurement difficulty depending on the temperature probe placement. Â <b>Oil</b> in <b>circulation</b> rates directly factor into the heat exchanger capacity calculations but also can affect the actual heat exchanged as well as the measurements themselves.

The {{vast majority of}} compressors used in the residential, automotive and light commercial air conditioning and refrigeration use pressure actuated reeds as the discharge valves.

In this work, a residential AC scroll compressor was equipped with sight windows on the discharge plenum and visualization studies were carried out using high speed imaging and processing techniques to identify the moment of oil mist generation, and also provide quantification of the droplet size and velocity distributions inside the discharge plenums. The compressor was run in a full system setup with measuring devices for mass flow rate, pressure, temperature and OCR (by sampling according to ASHRAE Standard 41. 4). Oil viscosity was varied from 9 cSt to 68 cSt along with OCR(0. 5 %- 3 %) and compressor volumetric flow rate, all while using R 134 a as the refrigerant. It was found that a very fine mist (drops with diameters below 88 micrometers) is generated right at the start of the opening process of the valve followed by interaction between the vapor flow and liquid (oil-refrigerant mixture) flow with the internal geometric features of the discharge plenum to generate larger droplets. It was observed that at higher volumetric flow rates, smaller droplets are produced and that the more viscous the oil, the larger the droplets generated.

This work is focused on the breakup process of the film that is formed between a reed valve and its seat. Emphasis is given on visualization of the breakup pattern and determination of the critical valve lift and velocity at which the film breaks during typical compressor operation. Preliminary experiments were carried out outside of the compressor environment, using a typical valve plate from a reciprocating compressor for household refrigerators. Observations of the breakup pattern show that the liquid film does not remain continuous until breakup into ligaments and droplets. In fact the stretched liquid film is first broken up into equally spaced liquid columns and then by means of the drag force promoted by the vapor flow due to the pressure difference it is blown away from the valve edge and starts the atomization process into a fine mist. Additional experiments were also carried out with two different oil viscosities (32 cSt 2 ̆ 6 120 cSt), and four different operating frequencies ranging from 30 Hz- 60 Hz in a scroll type compressor operating under typical residential air conditioning conditions.

40|$|A {{traditional}} {{method of}} controlling evaporator superheat in a vapor compression {{air conditioning system}} is the thermostatic expansion valve (TXV). Such systems are often used in automotive applications. The TXV depends on superheat to adjust the valve opening. Unfortunately, any amount of superheat causes that evaporator to operate at reduced capacity due to dramatically lower heat transfer coefficients in the superheated region. In addition, <b>oil</b> <b>circulation</b> back to the compressor is impeded. The cold lubricant almost devoid of dissolved refrigerant is quite viscous and clings to the evaporator walls.

40|$|As {{microchannel}} {{heat exchangers}} {{have become more}} sophisticated in their design, more exact understanding of the flow inside them is necessary. A decrease in diameter enhances the heat transfer (which {{takes place at the}} inner walls of the tubes), but also increases the pressure drop (as the diameter decreases, it becomes like drinking a milkshake through a coffee stirrer). The inclusion of even small amounts of <b>oil</b> in <b>circulation</b> can have a significant effect as well. Historical correlations and studies of two-phase flow {{have been shown to be}} insufficient for predicting pressure drops in the smaller channels, due to the different fluid physics that are relevant in flows of small diameter. This study is aimed at understanding the fluid property effects that contribute to pressure drop and flow regime. Two-phase pressure drop data for four refrigerants (R 134 a, R 410 A, R 290 and R 717) were measured in a channel with hydraulic diameter of 148 ??m. These data were combined with previous two-phase data of R 134 a in small channels (hydraulic diameters ranging from 70 to 300 ??m) to generate a separated flow model that spans a wide variety of fluid properties. Refrigerant was then mixed with two different viscosities of oil at concentrations ranging from 0. 5 to 5 % oil, and two- phase pressure drop measurements were taken of those mixtures. Flow visualizations of three of these refrigerants (R 134 a, R 290 and R 717) and several concentrations of a R 134 a-oil mixture were made in a channel with 500 ??m hydraulic diameter, and flow regime classifications and comparisons with previous flow maps were made.

40|$|Since the Montreal and Kyoto {{protocols}} mandated the phase-out of refrigerants which deplete {{the ozone}} layer and have high global warming potential, respectively, {{there has been an}} extensive global initiative to identify suitable environmentally sustainable alternatives. Replacement of CFCs and HCFCs with HFCs has successfully addressed the objectives of the Montreal protocol. However, most HFCs used today are not acceptable for the long term because they have GWPs greater than 1, 000. Low GWP refrigerants that are, or will be, considered as replacements for HFCs include R 32, hydrocarbons such as R 290, carbon dioxide (R 744), and hydroflouro olefins such as HFO 1234 yf and HFO 1234 ze(E). It has already been determined that in many cases new lubricants will be required for these refrigerants to ensure long term compressor reliability and the best possible system performance. The primary issue that must be addressed is the unacceptable high mutual solubility of the refrigerant and lubricant at high lubricant concentrations. The first consequence of this high solubility is the excessive reduction of viscosity that affects proper lubrication of the compressor and components, sealing of clearances between low and high pressure sides of the compressor. The second is a significant change in the steady state amount of <b>oil</b> in the <b>circulation</b> stream in the system, which can impact the heat transfer performance in both the evaporator and condenser. Another potential minor issue is refrigerant flash evaporation at discharge creating excessive foaming and noise. This paper describes details of a method used to measure the thermophysical properties of refrigerant lubricant mixtures. The general methods for data acquisition and processing, along with creation of Daniel charts were in accord with those developed by Chris Seeton. The results of measurements involving mixtures of traditional POEs with R- 32 or R- 410 A shows that lubricant viscosities in the compressor at various conditions within the normal operating envelope decrease by as much as 25 - 54 %. This illustrates the excessive lubricant viscosity dilution of R- 32 relative to R- 410 A with traditional POs used today with HFCs refrigerants. The solution property measurement technique was also used to develop a class of advanced ester POE lubricants optimized for R- 32 to eliminates the viscosity dilution problem. Significant energy savings can be achieved through proper optimization of lubricant/refrigerant solution properties to provide the best balance of lubrication in the compressor while maintaining excellent heat transfer in the refrigeration cycle...|$|R
