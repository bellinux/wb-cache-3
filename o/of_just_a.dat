5|$|Early {{suggestions}} were to show cutaways <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> {{small portion}} of the audience, but the full effect was achieved by only showing the back of the audience. To save time, most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, Ratatouille. Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is Skinner's lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.|$|E

5|$|Shaughnessy mentored {{middle linebacker}} Bill George as the {{defensive}} play-caller. Bears coach Abe Gibron likened George to having Shaughnessy {{himself on the}} field. Shaughnessy worked to counter {{the increasing use of}} the forward pass. He emphasized man-to-man coverage, dropped linebackers or defensive ends into pass coverage, and utilized blitzes from multiple directions—which had previously consisted mostly <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> middle linebacker.|$|E
50|$|The Java {{implementation}} initially consisted <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> interpreter, but a compiler to Java bytecode {{was later}} added. This compiler only worked on certain procedures. The Java version of Factor {{was replaced by}} a version written in C and Factor. Initially, this consisted <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>an</b> interpreter, but the interpreter was replaced by two compilers, used in different situations. Over time, the Factor implementation has grown significantly faster.|$|R

5|$|Understanding data {{dependencies}} {{is fundamental}} in implementing parallel algorithms. No program can run {{more quickly than}} the longest chain of dependent calculations (known as the critical path), since calculations that depend upon prior calculations in the chain must be executed in order. However, most algorithms do not consist <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> long chain of dependent calculations; there are usually opportunities to execute independent calculations in parallel.|$|E

While there, it received a number of drafts of recruits and was brought up to strength. With an authorised strength of around 900 personnel, like other Australian infantry battalions of the time, the battalion was formed around a nucleus of four rifle companies– designated 'A' through to 'D'– each consisting of three platoons.|$|E
5|$|The United States is {{the only}} {{advanced}} economy that does not guarantee its workers paid vacation and is one <b>of</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few {{countries in the world}} without paid family leave as a legal right, with the others being Papua New Guinea, Suriname and Liberia. While federal law currently does not require sick leave, it is a common benefit for government workers and full-time employees at corporations. 74% of full-time American workers get paid sick leave, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although only 24% of part-time workers get the same benefits. In 2009, the United States had the third-highest workforce productivity per person in the world, behind Luxembourg and Norway. It was fourth in productivity per hour, behind those two countries and the Netherlands.|$|E

The anime's structure {{has been compared to}} Azumanga Daioh, with thematic influences from Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu.
