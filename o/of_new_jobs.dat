Between 2000 and 2008, the majority <b>of</b> <b>new</b> <b>jobs</b> created in Northern England were {{for the government and}} its suppliers and contractors.

The austerity programme under the government of David Cameron saw significant cuts to public services, and the reduction in public sector employment resulted in job losses for around 3% of the Northern England workforce with significant impact on the regional economy.|$|E

25|$|Consequently, {{from the}} later 1970s, Telford began to attract {{high-technology}} firms and to diversify its industry, {{and the promotion}} of the Service industry also began to prosper, in the Telford Town Centre area.

Unemployment grew from 3.4 per cent in 1969 to over 8 per cent in 1972 and 22.3 per cent (almost double the national average) in 1983; long-term unemployment rose even faster. Nevertheless, the rate of increase in unemployment was slowing down by 1983 and was making some progress against national and regional trends.|$|E
