5|$|The size of {{the brain}} and a person's {{intelligence}} are not strongly related. Studies tend to indicate small to moderate correlations (averaging around 0.3 to 0.4) between brain volume and IQ. The most consistent associations are observed within the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, the hippocampi, and the cerebellum, but these only account for a relatively small amount of variance in IQ, which itself has <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>partial</b> relationship to general intelligence and real-world performance.|$|E
5|$|When a tooth is lost, dentures, bridges, or {{implants}} {{may be used}} as replacements. Dentures {{are usually}} the least costly whereas implants are usually the most expensive. Dentures may replace complete arches of the mouth or <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>partial</b> number of teeth. Bridges replace smaller spaces of missing teeth and use adjacent teeth to support the restoration. Dental implants may be used to replace a single tooth or a series of teeth. Though implants are the most expensive treatment option, they are often the most desirable restoration because of their aesthetics and function. To improve the function of dentures, implants {{may be used as}} support.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the modern}} county of Greater Manchester was not created until 1974, {{the history of}} its {{constituent}} settlements goes back centuries. There is evidence of Iron Age habitation, particularly at Mellor, and Celtic activity in a settlement named Chochion, {{believed to have been}} an area of Wigan settled by the Brigantes. Stretford was also part of the land believed to have been occupied by the Celtic Brigantes tribe, and lay on their border with the Cornovii on the southern side of the River Mersey. The remains of 1st-century forts at Castlefield in Manchester, and Castleshaw Roman fort in Saddleworth, are evidence of Roman occupation. Much of the region was omitted from the Domesday Book of 1086; Redhead states that this was because <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>partial</b> survey was taken, rather than sparsity of population.|$|E

5|$|Juvenile terns {{typically}} have brown- or yellow-tinged upperparts, and the feathers have dark edges {{that give the}} plumage a scaly appearance. They have dark bands on the wings and short tails. In most species, the subsequent moult does not start until after migration, the plumage then becoming more like the adult, but with some retained juvenile feathers and a white forehead with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>partial</b> dark cap. By the second summer, the appearance is very like the adult, and full mature plumage is usually attained by the third year. After breeding, terns moult into a winter plumage, typically showing a white forehead. Heavily worn or aberrant plumages such as melanism and albinism are much rarer in terns than in gulls.|$|E
5|$|Katia tracked west-northwestward {{for several}} days, steered by an {{expansive}} mid-level ridge to the cyclone's north. The strong upper-level winds that were affecting the cyclone gradually slackened, {{allowing for the}} expansion of a central dense overcast, the formation of a large curved band in the southern semicircle, and development of a banding eye on microwave imagery. Satellite intensity estimates increased accordingly, prompting the NHC to upgrade Katia to hurricane intensity at 00:00UTC on September1, while the storm was situated about 1,350miles (2,175km) east of the Leeward Islands. Although conditions were forecast to remain conducive for further intensification, water vapor satellite and microwave imagery indicated that mid-level dry air began eroding eyewall convection immediately after the storm's upgrade, and upper-level winds eventually became less favorable as Katia approached a sharp upper-level trough. As a result, the storm maintained its status as a minimal hurricane for almost three days, with <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>partial</b> eyewall or banding-eye feature appearing on satellite.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the U.S. Naval Academy in 1867, Sebree was posted {{to a number of}} vessels before being {{assigned}} to a rescue mission to find the remaining crew of the missing Polaris in the Navy's first mission to the Arctic. This attempt was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>partial</b> success—the Polaris crew was rescued by a British ship rather than the US Navy—but this led to Sebree's selection eleven years later for a second expedition to the Arctic. That mission to rescue Adolphus Greely and the survivors of the Lady Franklin Bay expedition was a success. Sebree was subsequently appointed as the second acting governor of American Samoa. He served in this position for only a year before returning to the United States. In 1907, he was promoted to rear admiral and given command of the Pathfinder Expedition around the South American coast before being appointed commander of the 2nd Division of the Pacific Fleet and then commander-in-chief of the entire fleet. He retired in 1910 and died in Coronado, California, in 1922. Two geographical features in Alaska—Sebree Peak and Sebree Island—are named for Admiral Sebree.|$|E

5|$|In 1987, Jones {{announced}} his candidacy for lieutenant governor, admitting {{that he considered}} the office a stepping stone to some day becoming governor. He was elected, but experienced a poor relationship with Governor Wallace Wilkinson throughout their four-year terms. Jones was elected governor in 1991, turning back a challenge from Governor Wilkinson's wife Martha in the Democratic primary. (Wilkinson was ineligible to succeed himself in office.) Although Jones maintained a strained relationship with the Kentucky General Assembly following comments he made {{in the wake of}} the federal Operation Boptrot investigation, he was still able to pass much of his agenda, including an amendment that would allow state officials to succeed themselves in office once. (Jones was able to secure passage of the amendment by exempting the state's sitting officials, including himself.) However, he achieved <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>partial</b> victory on his top priority– health care reform. While the legislature acceded to many of Jones' proposals, such as eliminating the practice of denying insurance coverage to those with pre-existing conditions, they did not approve his mandate for universal health care for all Kentuckians. Following his term in office, Jones founded the Kentucky Equine Education Project. He considered running for governor again in 2003, but never formally became a candidate.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes Venus only grazes the Sun {{during a}} transit. In {{this case it}} is {{possible}} that in some areas of the Earth a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>partial</b> transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 6 December 1631, and the next such transit will occur on 13 December 2611. It is also possible that a transit of Venus can be seen {{in some parts of the}} world as a partial transit, while in others Venus misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 19 November 541 BC, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 2854. These effects occur due to parallax, since the size of the Earth affords different points of view with slightly different lines of sight to Venus and the Sun. It can be demonstrated by closing an eye and holding a finger in front of a smaller more distant object; when you open the other eye and close the first, the finger will no longer be in front of the object.|$|E

25|$|Both {{buprenorphine}} and methadone are medications {{used for}} detoxification, short- and long-term opioid replacement therapy. Buprenorphine {{has the advantage}} of being <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>partial</b> agonist; hence negating the potential for life-threatening respiratory depression in cases of abuse. Studies show the effectiveness of buprenorphine and methadone are almost identical, and largely share adverse-effect profiles apart from more sedation among methadone users. At low flexible doses from 2 to 6mg, however, buprenorphine has a lower retention rate than from low doses 40mg or less of methadone.|$|E
25|$|The median ends {{just east}} of the {{interchange}} with the Palisades Interstate Parkway (exit 16 of the Palisades).

This is followed by ramps to the Palisades southbound and from the Palisades northbound, where Lake Welch Parkway ends. It is <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>partial</b> interchange, lacking a connection between Lake Welch Parkway northbound and Palisades Interstate Parkway northbound.

25|$|Although <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>partial</b> victory {{which did}} not remove Sheridan from the field, the Battle of Dinwiddie Court House {{temporarily}} gave the initiative to the Confederates. Union cavalry, most armed with seven shot repeating carbines or rifles, fought both Confederate cavalry and infantry and slowed the spirited Confederate progress throughout the day. Sheridan's delaying actions were effective at several points but the Union cavalry was pushed back almost to Dinwiddie Court House {{by the end of}} the day. Nonetheless, the Confederates had suffered additional losses and could not hold their advanced position.|$|E

25|$|The second {{engagement}} around Eora Creek–Templeton's Crossing was {{the first}} victory of the Kokoda Campaign for the Australians, but as Williams argues it was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>partial</b> victory in so much as while the Australians had secured an exit from the mountainous Owen Stanleys, the Japanese force had not been destroyed and was therefore able to withdraw further north and continue to delay the Australian pursuit. In {{the aftermath of the}} fighting, the Australian high command relieved the 7th Division commander, Allen, of his command, citing the slow progress of his troops against a Japanese force half their size.|$|E
25|$|Argento invited his mentor, Mario Bava, {{to provide}} some of the optical effects, matte {{paintings}} and trick shots for the film.
