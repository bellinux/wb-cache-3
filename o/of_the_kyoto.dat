5|$|Japan ranks 39th in the 2016 Environmental Performance Index, which {{measures}} a nation's commitment to environmental sustainability. As a signatory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol {{and host of}} the 1997 conference that created it, Japan is under treaty obligation to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions and to take other steps to curb climate change.|$|E
5|$|On 6 December 2007, the New Zealand Emission Unit Register (NZEUR) was established. The NZEUR has {{the role}} of issuing, holding, {{transferring}} and retiring emission units in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol. The initial use of the NZEUR was to record Kyoto emission units allocated to firms enrolled in the Ministry for the Environment’s Projects to Reduce Emissions and Negotiated Greenhouse Agreements programmes, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry’s Permanent Forest Sink Initiative.|$|E
5|$|The NZ ETS {{contains}} special {{transitional provisions}} from 1 July 2010 (when fossil emissions enter the scheme) until 31 December 2012 (transition period). This end date {{coincides with the}} end date <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol. Although transitional measures are legislated to end after 2012, the Government has suggested {{that they will be}} extended in the event that major trading partners such as the USA and Australia do not implement emissions trading schemes of their own before then.|$|E

25|$|As {{noted earlier}} on, <b>the</b> first-round <b>Kyoto</b> {{emissions}} limitation commitments {{are not sufficient}} to stabilize <b>the</b> atmospheric concentration <b>of</b> GHGs.

30|$|Although {{there is}} a {{community}} system <b>of</b> quotas, <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> goals differ {{from one country to}} another. France, for example, is committed to achieving 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012 while Sweden hopes to achieve a four percentage point reduction.|$|R

40|$|<b>The</b> {{signature}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto’s</b> Protocol has <b>the</b> aim {{to reduce}} greenhouse gas emissions, through several instruments as <b>the</b> market <b>of</b> emission rights.

In <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> Spain, this is published in the “Plan Nacional de Asignación (PNA) de Derechos de Emisión”. <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> this work is to review the "Emission trading system" as an instrument in order to fulfil <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol and its influence on <b>the</b> offer <b>of</b> electricity.

25|$|In the Clean Development Mechanism, only {{afforestation}} and reforestation {{are eligible}} to produce certified emission reductions (CERs) in the first commitment period <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kyoto</b> Protocol (2008–2012).

Also, agricultural carbon sequestration is not possible yet.|$|E
25|$|Accounting systems {{differ on}} {{precisely}} {{what constitutes a}} valid offset for voluntary reduction systems and for mandatory reduction systems.
