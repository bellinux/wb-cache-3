500|$|The Ramones' {{debut album}} had an outsized effect {{relative}} to its modest sales. According to Generation X bassist Tony James, [...] "Everybody went up three gears {{the day they}} got that first Ramones album. Punk rock—that rama-lama super fast stuff—is totally down to the Ramones. Bands were just playing in an MC5 groove until then." [...] The Ramones' two July 1976 shows, like their debut album, are seen as having {{a significant impact on}} the style of many of the newly formed British punk acts—as one observer put it, [...] "instantly nearly every band speeded up". The Ramones' first British concert, at London's Roundhouse concert hall, was held on July 4, 1976, the United States Bicentennial. The Sex Pistols were playing in Sheffield that evening, supported by the Clash, making their public debut. The next night, members of both bands attended the Ramones' gig at the Dingwall's club. Ramones manager Danny Fields recalls a conversation between Johnny Ramone and Clash bassist Paul Simonon (which he mislocates at the Roundhouse): [...] "Johnny asked him, 'What do you do? Are you in a band?' Paul said, 'Well, we just rehearse. We call ourselves the Clash but we're not good enough.' Johnny said, 'Wait till you see us—we stink, we're lousy, we can't play. Just get <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it.'" [...] Another band whose members saw the Ramones perform, the Damned, played their first show two days later. The central fanzine of the early UK punk scene, Sniffin' Glue, was named after the song [...] "Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue", which appeared on the debut LP.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked if}} she would return in 2004, Benjamin said, [...] "I loved Lisa. She was a great {{character}} and I loved playing all those story lines. It was a wonderful opportunity for me but all that angst and that drama can sometimes get to you. She hasn't been killed off. Loads of characters are revived and brought back but I don't know if it's something I'd want to do again at the moment. It still feels like only yesterday I was there and it's good to kind of recharge your batteries and get <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> other things. But I love the show and I’d never say never! And I liked playing Lisa. I {{thought she was a}} great character so you just don’t know." ...|$|E
2500|$|A key {{moment in}} that race took place at an all-candidates debate in Montreal on June 2, 1990, where the {{discussion}} quickly turned to the Meech Lake Accord, which had emerged as the major policy issue that divided Martin and Chrétien. At the debate on June 2, 1990, Martin attempted to force Chrétien to abandon the latter's nuanced position on Meech Lake and speak out for or against it, arguing that his position of opposing Meech Lake as it is, but with willing to support with amendments was attempting {{to have it both}} ways. When Chrétien refused to endorse Meech as it was, young Liberal delegates crowding the hall began to chant [...] "vendu" [...] ("sellout" [...] in French), [...] "you're selling out to the Anglos" [...] and [...] "Judas" [...] at Chrétien. One of Chrétien's aides frenetically asked that Martin [...] "get the fuck <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> something" [...] as the Young Liberals continue shouting abuse at Chrétien-to his clear discomfort-only to be told that Quebec youth were [...] "hotheads" [...] whom nobody could control. In private, Chrétien was deeply enraged by the incident, and claimed that the delegates shouting vendu at him were actually Martin supporters from Toronto, charging that their poor French had betrayed that they were not from Quebec. Martin denied involvement in 'coordinating' any response from the floor, or a similar outburst by his supporters at the convention.|$|E

5000|$|On his {{decision}} to continue playing professional golf on the Senior Tour, Floyd spoke with Golf Digest and mused aloud: [...] "Why do I enjoy golf after 31 years, going <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> things {{that are necessary to}} be competitive—having practice, having to work, having to dedicate yourself? I guess {{it comes down to the}} competition. My personality...I'm not going to play if I'm not competitive." ...|$|R
5000|$|While Maurice Gibb, on {{the other}} hand, cites their manager Robert Stigwood as the first to suggest Miami as {{the best place to}} record new songs. [...] "He Robert showed us the picture on the cover 461 Ocean Boulevard and said, 'You can rent that place <b>and</b> live <b>there</b> <b>and</b> record and get a sun tan.'

She could take the work <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it as well as here, and she could come in now and then, when a chance offered, and ask me about the hard words, for which she could leave blanks. Or, if I happen to be in the neighborhood, I could stop in there and see how she was getting on. I would much rather arrange the business in that way, than have her pop into my office at any moment to ask me about my illegible words." ...|$|E

They were playing music around their jobs, not as their jobs. It was like, if we're gonna be a band, let's be a band. This isn't going to happen by itself." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{brainchild of}} {{original}} director, Brenda Chapman, Merida is Pixar's first female lead. Overall Merida has received good reports from critics, some saying she is [...] "a {{breath of fresh}} air among the princesses, and from a culture Disney has not yet explored. She is a good role model for girls who want to get <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> it. Merida is certainly no damsel in distress and isn't haughty; she is torn between doing what's expected of her and following her heart. The people of Scotland have to accept Merida." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Time {{magazine}} {{asked about}} The Harry Potter Alliance, Rowling said, [...] "It's incredible, it's humbling, and it's uplifting {{to see people}} going <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> that {{in the name of}} your character. What did my books preach against throughout? Bigotry, violence, struggles for power, no matter what. All of these things are happening in Darfur. So they really couldn't have chosen a better cause." [...] Rowling awarded The Harry Potter Alliance a Fan Site Award in December 2007.|$|R
5000|$|Looking {{back on the}} season, Nagasu said, [...] "Getting my {{body back}} into shape the injury was tough. I really did not get back into shape until Four Continents, where I did the best I could."

5000|$|Michelle Giroux {{has shown}} a {{particular}} aptitude for willful, witty, and elegant young women in her portrayals of Lady Teazle in The School for Scandal, Gwendolyn in The Importance of Being Earnest, and Olivia in Twelfth Night.

[...] "You absorb so much and at the same time you're <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> on that incredible stage. It's work and it's a dream and it's a whole life.|$|R
5000|$|Aaron Johnson, {{who plays}} the character, says that Kick-Ass is a [...] "sensitive guy" [...] who lost his mother and is a [...] "nobody" [...] at school, so he creates his superhero {{identity}} [...] "as this whole different persona." [...] Johnson said that Dave is [...] "a kid who’s got the guts to go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> something different."

He also requires a dialect coach for the American accent to suit the character.|$|E

In addition to Perry (lead guitar, vocals), the album features German vocalist Hagen Grohe, Joe Perry Project bassist David Hull, pianist Willie Alexander, organ player Paul Santo, and drummers Marty Richards, Ben Tileston and Scott Meeder. According to Perry, {{one of the reasons}} for releasing another solo album is [...] "because you can get <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> whatever you want and you don't have to answer to anybody." [...] The album's first single was [...] "We've Got a Long Way to Go." ...|$|E

5000|$|The actor Dewi Rhys is a Cofi. He {{has written}} a book on Cofi humour called ‘Hiwmor Y Cofi.’ He comments:‘I don’t think we as Cofis try and be individual, but we just are. We like to think that we’re life’s losers, but we look forward to getting <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> {{different}} things. When you first meet a Cofi, you’re usually greeted with this deadpan sort of look, you can never tell what’s going through their minds. That’s probably down to shyness or a desire to be left alone. I think it’s fair to say that you don’t get much small talk with a Cofi’ ...|$|R
5000|$|Of the {{occasion}} he said: [...] "found I was {{playing on the}} afternoon of the game. We had lunch and then we had a team meeting. Harry Catterick said there would be only one change. He said “Denis Stevens - you move to number 4 and Colin Harvey goes to number 8” This was all because Gabby was injured at the time. It was as simple as that! I just gasped, I didn’t have a clue that I was going to play - it was a great way of doing it, he didn’t {{give me a chance to}} think about it, I just had to go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> play!

5000|$|When a Frontline {{interviewer}} later asked Henkle if he {{saw himself}} as an activist he replied: [...] "I've been preparing for it my whole life. I got an immense education in ignorance through my high schools. That definitely prepared me for a long, hard struggle in life. It's great today, because I can be safe in my household. I can be safe in life. I can be safe in my job even, because I work {{for a company that}} is very accepting. I do a lot of non-profit work, which allows me to be very free and very liberated to go <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> that. Not everybody has that benefit." ...|$|E
5000|$|According to McNamara, Team Bondi {{closed down}} {{because they had}} not signed another project in the time they needed to. McNamara stated [...] "we {{got a lot of}} bad press {{about what it was like}} to work with us and our conditions. That, obviously, didn't come at the right time. To do a deal for a major video game {{probably}} takes about a year. We didn't start running around doing that stuff until well after the game was finished. That's the problem when a game is all-consuming and you need to get <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>do</b> whatever you need to do to get people to know it and interested. They would probably be the two main things, I'd say." ...|$|E

Cumani commented [...] "He did it very, very well. I was very pleased as I thought he would need the race. I’ve not been able to do everything I wanted with him, but he probably knows best now.

5000|$|Fletcher recalls {{presenting}} GamesMaster was 'very unforgiving' and 'quite intimidating'. He {{claimed the}} most difficult part was 'just getting up, taking a deep breath, <b>and</b> going <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>doing</b> it'. His style of presenting was heavily criticised by viewers who said his 'in your face' method was too 'OTT' <b>and</b> <b>did</b> not suit the show. Some viewers suspected his genuine Cockney accent was put on for effect. The series finished in 1994 and Dominik Diamond returned for the last four series until the show ended in February 1998. The show's creator Jane Hewland later said in a restrospective interview, that she sees the third series as a [...] "lost" [...] one, due to admitting to a series of poor decisions and mistakes, including hiring Fletcher as main presenter.|$|R
5000|$|Gaghan met Baer {{for lunch}} and then, for six weeks in 2002, the two men {{traveled}} from Washington to Geneva to the French Riviera to Lebanon, Syria and Dubai, meeting with lobbyists, arms dealers, oil traders, Arab officials and the spiritual leader of Hezbollah. Meeting Baer, Gaghan realized {{that the man had}} [...] "gone <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>done</b> <b>and</b> seen things that he was not allowed to talk about, and wouldn't, but he was angry about and also trying to make amends for." [...] Before any filming took place, Gaghan convinced Warner Bros. to give him an unlimited research budget and no deadline. He did his own legwork, meeting with oil traders in London and lawyers in Washington, D.C. Moments after arriving in Beirut in 2002, Gaghan was taken from the airport in a blindfold and hood where he met with Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, who was interested in films. He decided to grant the writer an audience even though he had not requested one. In addition, Gaghan dined with men suspected of killing former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri and met with former Defense Policy Board chairman Richard Perle.|$|R

Speaking to the Evening News in October 1979, Harley admitted: [...] "I spent almost a full year <b>out</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> <b>did</b> nothing except swim and sunbathe and head for some party or other at night.

In a situation like this a lot of bands jump to conclusions and decide to break up, but we never had any intentions of breaking up.
