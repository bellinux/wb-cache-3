50|$|Dra Bol - {{when the}} first string is stroked from inward and then {{immediately}} outward very fast, giving the <b>outward</b> <b>stroke</b> more power/emphasis than inward stroke.|$|E
5000|$|When used as {{a variant}} of the missionary position, the male lies above the female but moves upward along the woman's body, until his erection, which would {{otherwise}} point [...] "up," [...] is pointing [...] "down", the dorsal side of the penis now pressing against the clitoris; and as opposed to the missionary position, the maleâ€™s body moves downward (relative to the female's) during the inward stroke, and upward for the <b>outward</b> <b>stroke.</b> She may also wrap her legs around his. Sexual movement is focused in the pelvises, without leverage from the arms or legs. The rocking upward stroke (where the female leads) and downward stroke (where the male leads) of sexual movement builds arousal that partners let develop and peak naturally. The woman on top variant is known as the reverse coital alignment technique.|$|E
5000|$|Measured in millihenries (mH), {{this is the}} {{inductance}} of {{the voice}} coil. The coil is a lossy inductor, {{in part due to}} losses in the pole piece, so the apparent inductance changes with frequency. Large Le values limit the high frequency output of the driver and cause response changes near cutoff. Simple modeling software often neglects Le, and so does not include its consequences. Inductance varies with excursion because the voice coil moves relative to the polepiece, which acts as a sliding inductor core, increasing inductance on the inward stroke and decreasing it on the <b>outward</b> <b>stroke</b> in typical overhung coil arrangements. This inductance modulation is an important source of nonlinearity (distortion) in loudspeakers. Including a copper cap on the pole piece, or a copper shorting ring on it, can reduce the increase in impedance seen at higher frequencies in typical drivers, and also reduce the nonlinearity due to inductance modulation.|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{called the}} resistive exercise device (RED) {{has been proposed}} to satisfy a requirement for exercise equipment aboard the International Space Station (ISS) that could passively exert a selectable constant load on both the <b>outward</b> and return <b>strokes.</b> The RED could be used alone; alternatively, the RED {{could be used in}} combination with another apparatus called the treadmill with vibration isolation and stabilization (TVIS), in which case the combination would be called the subject load device (SLD). The basic RED would be a passive device, but it could incorporate an electric motor to provide eccentric augmentation (augmentation to make the load during inward movement greater than the load during outward movement). The RED concept represents a unique approach to providing a constant but selectable resistive load for exercise for the maintenance and development of muscles. Going beyond the original ISS application, the RED could be used on Earth as resistive weight training equipment. The advantage of the RED over conventional weight-lifting equipment is that it could be made portable and lightweight...|$|R
40|$|A {{solar engine}} is {{disclosed}} {{in which a}} fluid, which is first heated and then cooled, forces a piston outward as the fluid is heated, and then draws the piston inward as the fluid is cooled. The piston is connected to a shaft and produces work as it moves outward and inward. A displacer plate moves between an absorber plate and a cooling plate to form an air space between the displacer and {{one or the other}} of these two plates for heating and cooling the fluid. The displacer plate is moved from one plate to the other by the displacer push ring as the piston nears the midpoint of its travel on the <b>outward</b> <b>stroke</b> and again on the inward stroke...|$|E
