500|$|The 2011 {{release of}} the Nintendo 3DS, the {{successor}} to the Nintendo DS series of handhelds, was announced on March 23, 2010, to preempt impending news leaks by the Japanese press and to attract potential attendees to the Electronic Entertainment Expo. According to industry analysts, the timing drew attention from the North American launch of the DSi XL. M2 Research senior analyst Billy Pigeon argued the [...] "XL is <b>old</b> <b>news</b> ... in Japan– and Nintendo is a very Japan-centric organization. This is just the corporate parent in Japan maybe not acting {{in the best interest}} of Nintendo of America."

500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{television}} reviewer Ken Tucker {{said the}} episode was [...] "rather short on laugh-out-loud funniness", but included several clever ideas, including the Tiger Woods video game, the satire {{of the media}} attention to the Woods scandal, and [...] "one of the best Kenny death scenes ever". Newsweek writer Joshua Alston said the Woods parody [...] "didn't manage to be terribly funny or insightful", and suggested {{the speed at which}} South Park writers can produce a topical episode just days before its broadcast is actually a detriment to the show. Alston said, [...] "Whereas once the show's creators swiftly turned around topical episodes because they could, now the South Park team is expected to seize on the news." [...] Ramsey Isler of IGN found much of the episode's humor mediocre, in particular the rehabilitation of the celebrities and the CDC studies of the chimpanzees. Isler said he enjoyed Kenny's death and Butters' obsession with [...] "bush", but felt the theme of the episode was too obvious and less clever than previous South Park episodes. The A.V. Club writer Zack Handlen appreciated the timeliness and relevance of the subject matter, but felt [...] "the satirical target here wasn't meaty enough to warrant a full episode, and the developing plot just felt too half-assed". Handlen said some individual jokes were funny, but the episode as a whole was too one-note and redundant. Carlos Delgado of iF Magazine said the Woods scandal was several months old, so the episode felt stale and <b>old</b> <b>news.</b> Delgado felt the alien infection theory was too random and lazy, and the idea that men would cheat on their wives if they had more money and opportunity was offensive, but not entirely untrue.|$|E

60|$|He {{tried to}} figure the {{individual}} life. It astonished him to realise how little the common man had changed {{in spite of the}} visible change in his conditions. Life and property, indeed, were secure from violence almost all over the world, zymotic diseases, bacterial diseases of all sorts had practically vanished, everyone had a sufficiency of food and clothing, was warmed in the city ways and sheltered from the weather--so much the almost mechanical progress of science and the physical organisation of society had accomplished. But the crowd, he was already beginning to discover, was a crowd still, helpless in the hands of demagogue and organiser, individually cowardly, individually swayed by appetite, collectively incalculable. The memory of countless figures in pale blue canvas came before his mind. Millions of such men and women below him, he knew, had never been out of the city, had never seen beyond the little round of unintelligent grudging participation in the world's business, and unintelligent dissatisfied sharing in its tawdrier pleasures. He thought of the hopes of his vanished contemporaries, and for a moment the dream of London in Morris's quaint <b>old</b> <b>News</b> from Nowhere, and the perfect land of Hudson's beautiful Crystal Age--appeared before him in an atmosphere of infinite loss. He thought of his own hopes.|$|E
