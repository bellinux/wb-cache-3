On 4 November, Gambira published editorials in the Washington Post and The Guardian calling for the international community to continue sanctions against Burma's leadership, for Russia and China to cease supporting the SPDC on the United Nations Security Council, and for Burma's people to continue to peacefully protest against the military rulers. [...] "The regime's use of mass arrests, murder, torture and imprisonment has failed to extinguish <b>our</b> <b>desire</b> for the freedom that was stolen from us so many years ago. We have taken their best punch", he wrote in the Post. [...] The day that the editorials appeared, Gambira was arrested in Sagaing Region.

500|$|In {{the fall}} of 1967, it was decided the Christmas Candle would be renamed the Peace Candle, because the city planned to sell Christmas cards {{depicting}} the structure and hoped Easton would become known as [...] "the Peace Candle city". On October 18, the city's businesses issued a statement, [...] "Whether you choose {{to call it a}} Christmas Candle or a Peace Candle is not important. The important aspect is that the Candle is our clarion call, and this call will be issued this year as a reaffirmation of <b>our</b> <b>desire</b> for peace and harmony in all facts of our lives and throughout the world." [...] On November 27, 1967, about 1,500 people attended the Peace Candle lighting, which would prove to be the final ceremony of its kind for that incarnation of the candle, which would be rebuilt in subsequent years. The bells of six different downtown churches were rung during the ceremony, and people surrounded the Peace Candle holding lit wax candles themselves. Also in 1967, a photo and caption of the Peace Candle was featured in the December 6 issue Weekly Reader, a national children's newspaper circulated in the nation's schools. A columnist for the magazine named [...] "Aunt Em" [...] said it was featured because, [...] "I think the candle in Easton is especially lovely since it is a symbol for both Hanukkah and Christmas".

[...] Griet and Vermeer's relationship, Hall wrote, lacked [...] "... the sense of two people breathing easily in one another's company." [...] Owen Gleiberman, writing for Entertainment Weekly, remarked that Girl with a Pearl Earring [...] "... brings off something that few dramas about artists do. It gets you to see the world through new– which is to say, old– eyes." [...] Gleiberman added that while Johansson is silent for most of the film, [...] "... the interplay on her face of fear, ignorance, curiosity, and sex is intensely dramatic." [...] In Sight & Sound, David Jays wrote that [...] "Johansson's marvellous performance builds on the complex innocence of her screen presence (Ghost World, Lost in Translation)." [...] Jays concluded his review by praising Webber and Serra's ability to [...] "... deftly deploy daylight, candle and shadow, denying <b>our</b> <b>desire</b> to see clearly just as Vermeer refuses to explicate the situations in his paintings. The film's scenarios may be unsurprising, but Webber's solemn evocation of art in a grey world gives his story an apt, unspoken gravity." ...|$|E
