5|$|The {{building}} of the monument proceeded quickly after Congress had provided sufficient funding. In four years, it was completed, with the 100-ounce (2.83kg) aluminum apex/lightning-rod being put in place on December 6, 1884. The apex was the largest single piece <b>of</b> <b>aluminum</b> cast at the time, when aluminum commanded a price comparable to silver. Two years later, the Hall–Héroult process made aluminum easier to produce and the price <b>of</b> <b>aluminum</b> plummeted, making the once-valuable apex more ordinary, though it still provided a lustrous, non-rusting apex {{that served as the}} original lightning rod.

40|$|The stress {{relaxation}} behavior and springback equation <b>of</b> 7050 <b>aluminum</b> alloys during the age-forming process were studied through self-designed uniaxial tension device.

40|$|AbstractBased on Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), a {{quantitative}} analysis of resources consumption, energy consumption and pollutants emissions {{caused by the}} production <b>of</b> primary <b>aluminum</b> and recycled aluminum in China in year of 2008 were carried out.

These related to the advanced production technology of the alumina suitable for bauxite in China, phasing out of old plants some using Söderberg technology and the reduction of energy consumption of generating electricity.

5|$|Seeking {{alternatives}} to the difficult-to-work copper-nickel alloy, in June 1867 Longacre proposed that the five-cent piece be struck in aluminum. The new Mint director, Henry Linderman, objected to the proposal, stating that the price and supply <b>of</b> <b>aluminum</b> were as yet uncertain, and that the metal was too expensive to use in a minor coin. Numismatic historian Don Taxay, in his history of the United States Mint and its coins, noted that Linderman had proposed legislation increasing the proportion of nickel in the alloy to a third despite having earlier opposed the use of nickel in coins. Taxay suggested that Linderman was most likely influenced by Wharton and the metal's other advocates.|$|E

5|$|Argon-helium {{mixtures}} {{are also}} frequently utilized in GTAW, since they can increase {{control of the}} heat input while maintaining the benefits of using argon. Normally, the mixtures are made with primarily helium (often about 75% or higher) and a balance of argon. These mixtures increase the speed {{and quality of the}} AC welding <b>of</b> <b>aluminum,</b> and also make it easier to strike an arc. Another shielding gas mixture, argon-hydrogen, is used in the mechanized welding of light gauge stainless steel, but because hydrogen can cause porosity, its uses are limited. Similarly, nitrogen can sometimes be added to argon to help stabilize the austenite in austenitic stainless steels and increase penetration when welding copper. Due to porosity problems in ferritic steels and limited benefits, however, it is not a popular shielding gas additive.|$|E
5|$|As August ended, {{production}} {{continued to}} slip farther behind schedule.

A piece <b>of</b> <b>aluminum</b> foil was placed around Koenig's arm, covered by a protective pad and then hidden by the uniform sleeve.

5|$|Like {{the first}} welding process, forge welding, some modern welding methods {{do not involve}} the melting of the {{materials}} being joined. One of the most popular, ultrasonic welding, is used to connect thin sheets or wires made of metal or thermoplastic by vibrating them at high frequency and under high pressure. The equipment and methods involved are {{similar to that of}} resistance welding, but instead of electric current, vibration provides energy input. Welding metals with this process does not involve melting the materials; instead, the weld is formed by introducing mechanical vibrations horizontally under pressure. When welding plastics, the materials should have similar melting temperatures, and the vibrations are introduced vertically. Ultrasonic welding is commonly used for making electrical connections out <b>of</b> <b>aluminum</b> or copper, and it is also a very common polymer welding process.|$|E
