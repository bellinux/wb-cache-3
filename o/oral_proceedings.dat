40|$|We use sub-parsec {{resolution}} hydrodynamic resimulations of a Milky Way (MW) like galaxy at high redshift {{to investigate}} {{the formation of the}} MW satellite galaxies. More specifically, we assess the impact of supernova feedback on the dwarf progenitors of these satellite, and the efficiency of a simple instantaneous reionisation scenario in suppressing star formation at the low-mass end of this dwarf distribution. Identifying galaxies in our high redshift simulation and tracking them to z= 0 using a dark matter halo merger tree, we compare our results to present-day observations and determine the epoch at which we deem satellite galaxy formation must be completed. We find that only the low-mass end of the population of luminous subhalos of the Milky-Way like galaxy is not complete before redshift 8, and that although supernovae feedback reduces the stellar mass of the low-mass subhalos (log(M/Msolar) < 9), the number of surviving satellites around the Milky-Way like galaxy at z = 0 is the same in the run with or without supernova feedback. If a luminous halo is able to avoid accretion by the Milky-Way progenitor before redshift 3, then it is likely to survive as a MW satellite to redshift 0.

40|$|The ‘Graues Haus‘ (literally, the ‘grey house‘) {{was erected}} in the Alservorstadt {{right outside the}} city {{boundaries}} of Vienna between 1831 and 1839. Its original function was to house the Magistrates’ court for criminal matters, replacing the previous court house (known locally as the ‘Schranne’) that had been situated at Hoher Markt. With effect of 1 st July 1850 the municipal and manorial courts were abolished and the organisation of courts with which we are familiar today was introduced. At {{the same time the}} inquisitorial system was replaced with the adversarial one and public and <b>oral</b> court <b>proceedings</b> became the norm. The ‘Graues Haus’ now accommodated the criminal division of the Vienna Regional Court and the Vienna Prosecutor’s Office.

The court’s jail house was demolished between 1980 and 1996 and replaced with a new facility for the Josefstadt jail; the court itself was provided with modern court rooms.

40|$|We {{performed}} {{an analysis of}} the mid-infared properties of the 12 micron Seyfert sample, a complete unbiased 12 micron flux limited sample of local Seyfert galaxies selected from the IRAS Faint Source Catalog, based on low resolution spectra obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on-board Spitzer Space Telescope. A detailed presentation of this analysis is dicussed in Wu et al. (2009). We find that on average, the 15 - 30 micron slope of the continuum is - 0. 85 +/- 0. 61 for Seyfert 1 s and - 1. 53 +/- 0. 84 for Seyfert 2 s, and there is substantial scatter in each type. Moreover, nearly 32 % of Seyfert 1 s, and 9 % of Seyfert 2 s, display a peak in the mid-infrared spectrum at 20 micron, which is attributed to an additional hot dust component. The Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) equivalent width decreases with increasing dust temperature, as indicated by the global infrared color of the host galaxies. However, no statistical difference in PAH equivalent width is detected between the two Seyfert types, 1 and 2, of the same bolometric luminosity. Finally, we propose a new method to estimate the AGN contribution to the integrated 12 micron galaxy emission, by subtracting the "star formation" component in the Seyfert galaxies, making use of the tight correlation between PAH 11. 2 micron luminosity and 12 micron luminosity for star forming galaxies.

40|$|FROM IUS COMMUNE TO IUS PROPRIUM: HISTORICAL VIEW OF ORAL TRADITION IN CHILE’S LEGAL PROCEEDINGS This {{research}} {{has made it}} possible to demonstrate the various usages of the spoken word that have allowed, already since the “Derecho Indiano” (Pre-Columbian Law), representing the most relevant principles that are to date enforced and have been proposed by modern Procedural Law, even before these principles were established. Naturally, as obvious as it may seem, there is a problem underlying the study of oral tradition from an historical point of view: normally, the only record left of <b>oral</b> procedural <b>proceedings</b> is a testimony that it was held. Although this makes it difficult to study these proceedings, as it will be shown it is not impossible. In fact, many of the currently known principles have been created by extrapolating the features that a fair trial should have. Therefore, usually several of such principles coincide in diverse procedural acts, whose aim is not more than having the parties heard by the judge and granting them with similar possibilities for their defence, both against potential abuses from the judge and against accusations of the opposite party. The court, in turn, has the right and obligation of leading the process in the most expeditious and cost-effective way possible, not affecting the rights of the parties to have a process in some cases and, especially, to defend themselves. Finally, in the benefit of the parties and society, {{there is a need for}} publicizing some of these procedural acts. All of the above is materialized in a series of principles that inform the proceeding and which are closely related to oral tradition, even when some of these procedural acts are registered in writing. The existence of civil or criminal processes not mainly based on a written form, the socialization of active legitimization and the measures oriented towards facilitating access to civil and criminal justice for all citizens, and in conditions of inequality, which is obvious and not denied but on the contrary deemed to be necessary, cannot lead to a total publicity of the criminal and civil process, which is what has been promoted in a slightly ideological manner by many States since the 20 th century. Besides, as it can be noticed in this research, many of the innovations introduced in the last decade had already been applied in other times of our legal history with better or worst results. 1 Comisión Nacional de Investigación Científica y Tecnológica - CONICY...|$|R
