5|$|Over 340species {{of plants}} grow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks,</b> {{including}} approximately 200species of wildflowers. Some {{of the most}} common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b> Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.|$|E
5|$|In March 1937, {{five months}} after the wreck, the hulk of Ohioan—still aground near Seal Rock—caught fire when a {{watchman}} aboard the ship attempted to burn some meat in a refrigerator. The flames died out before reaching the explosives that remained aboard the wreck. A Pacific storm in December the same year caused the hulk of Ohioan to break in two. By 1939, only remnants of some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were still visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} wreck, {{when the rain}} had subsided, Captain Holland sent members of the Rifle Corps and the York and Lancaster Regiment to {{retrieve}} some baggage from the ship, which was stuck <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> and had not sunk. The operation was called off at 10:00, when First Lieutenant St. John decided that the wreck was too dangerous. The baggage that had been recovered was taken to shore.|$|E

5|$|The most {{predominant}} {{plant species}} in the alpine zone around the pass are the grass species adapted to the harsh climate. Other alpine flora, such as moss and lichens <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks,</b> and wildflowers in season, make appearances. Shrubs that survive among them include strawberry, snowberry, willows and bog birch. Animals in the alpine zone include ptarmigans, small burrowing species like pika, marmots, and pocket gopher, and mountain goats.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole of}} Scotland was {{subjected}} to glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch. A sign of this on Lismore {{is the presence of}} rock-cut platforms close to the seashore that indicate the changing sea-levels; in some areas of the northern coast they also betray the presence of ice by the striation marks <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Among {{her most}} famous roles were Anna Leonowens {{in the film}} version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I (1956); and {{opposite}} Cary Grant as his shipboard romantic interest Terri McKay in the bittersweet love story An Affair to Remember (1957). She reunited with Grant and Mitchum for a sophisticated comedy, The Grass Is Greener (1960), and then joined Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra in a love triangle for a romantic comedy, Marriage <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rocks</b> (1965). In 1966, the producers of Carry On Screaming! offered her a fee comparable to that paid {{to the rest of the}} cast combined, but she turned it down in favor of appearing in an aborted stage version of Flowers for Algernon.|$|E

5|$|Aurora's {{passage from}} the ice towards safety proved slow and perilous. Coal {{supplies}} had to be conserved, allowing only limited use of the engines, and the improvised emergency rudder made steering difficult; the ship wallowed helplessly at times, in danger of foundering. Even after making {{contact with the outside}} world, Stenhouse was initially reluctant to seek direct assistance, fearful that a salvage claim might create further embarrassment for the expedition. However, he was obliged to request help when, as Aurora neared New Zealand in stormy weather on 31 March, it was in danger of being driven <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b> Two days later the tug Dunedin reached the ship and a towline was secured. On the following morning, 3 April 1916, Aurora was brought into the harbour at Port Chalmers.|$|E
5|$|Hot springs {{are closely}} {{associated}} with fumaroles, which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and hot gases, such as sulfur dioxide. In general, the water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface. The formation of the springs depends both <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> the water has passed through and the profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater. Iron oxide, iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow, red, brown or green. Hot springs comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form siliceous sinter, whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy-looking calcareous rock called tufa. Overflow of the springs can build masses, spires or stepped terraces of calcareous sinter or tufa.|$|E
5|$|Makeup artist Baker {{provided}} the special makeup effects for The Incredible Melting Man, {{which included the}} gradual melting of Steve West. Rebar wore facial appliances that simulated melting flesh, and {{his hands and feet}} were fitted with liquid substances that dropped off as he walked, creating the appearance that West's body was falling apart. During one scene, a murdered fisherman's severed head falls down a waterfall and smashes <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> below. To create the effect, Baker used a gelatin head with a wax skull and fake blood inside, which burst out upon impact.|$|E

5|$|More than 70species {{of animals}} {{are known to}} live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, {{southern}} alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ohioans post-war {{career was}} {{relatively}} uneventful until 8 October 1936, {{when she ran}} aground near Seal Rock at the Golden Gate, the entrance to San Francisco Bay. Attempts to free the ship were unsuccessful and, because of the close proximity of the wreck to San Francisco, the grounded Ohioan drew large crowds to watch salvage operations. Angelo J. Rossi, the mayor of San Francisco, toured the wreck on 19 October. Ohioans hulk caught fire in March 1937, and the wreck broke into two pieces in a storm in December. As late as 1939, some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were still visible <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines were {{surrounded}} {{from all sides}} now. Some fell into the deep ravines off the steep slopes, others tried to escape in the waters, only to be smashed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> below and again others were killed in their flight. Nevertheless, {{a large number of}} the soldiers managed to escape the slaughter. Jonah, the Greek informant of the Rashidun army during the conquest of Damascus, died in this battle. The Muslims took no prisoners in this battle, although they may have captured some during the subsequent pursuit.|$|E

5|$|Two {{types of}} {{amphibians}} {{are found in}} the mounded prairie region, typically around vernal pools. The Pacific tree frog lives in large numbers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks,</b> while tadpoles of the rarer western toad can be seen between March and May. Mammals such as California voles, Heermann's kangaroo rats, raccoons, and long-tailed weasels can also be found in this region. The western meadowlark and two species of sparrows are the most common types of birds that are seen in the area. Turkey vultures, rock wren, three species of hawks, and other birds patrol the cliffs {{on the sides of the}} plateaus.|$|E
5|$|Bond's {{drinking}} habits run {{throughout the}} series of books. During the course of On Her Majesty's Secret Service alone, Bond consumes forty-six drinks: Pouilly-Fuissé, Riquewihr and Marsala wines, most of a bottle of Algerian wine, some 1953 Château Mouton Rothschild claret, along with Taittinger and Krug champagnes and Babycham; for whiskies he consumes three bourbon and waters, half a pint of I.W. Harper bourbon, Jack Daniel's whiskey, two double bourbons <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks,</b> two whisky and sodas, two neat scotches and one glass of neat whisky; vodka consumption totalled four vodka and tonics and three double vodka martinis; other spirits included two double brandies with ginger ale, a flask of Enzian Schnaps and a double gin: he also washed this down with four steins of German beer. Bond's alcohol intake {{does not seem to}} affect his performance.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{marriage}} and children, Walter Jones reportedly had a wandering eye. On April 18, he met Sharon Kinne when {{she bought a}} Ford Thunderbird from his dealership {{using some of the}} insurance payout from her husband's death, and the two began an affair shortly thereafter. Kinne viewed him as a prospect for a second husband, but Jones was uninterested in leaving his wife despite the rockiness of their relationship. When he declined to go on a trip to Washington with her in May, Kinne reluctantly went with her brother instead. Although the couple reunited on May 25, shortly after Kinne returned to Missouri, the relationship was quickly set <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> when Kinne told Jones that she was pregnant and he was the father of the baby. Jones, instead of responding with what Kinne expected to be an agreement to divorce his wife, ended the affair.|$|E
50|$|The {{event was}} again a great success. The crowd was {{so large that}} {{it was clear that}} Sci-Fi <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> had again outgrown a venue. This would be the last year that Sci-Fi <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rock</b> took place at the Holiday Inn.|$|R

5|$|Laura Knight {{spent the}} summer of 1908 working on the beaches at Newlyn making studies for her large {{painting}} of children in bright sunlight. The Beach was shown at the Royal Academy in 1909, and was considered a great success, showing Laura painting in a more Impressionist style than she had displayed previously. About this time she began painting compositions {{of women in the}} open air, in the plein-air manner, often <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> or cliff-tops around Lamorna. Knight would sometimes use models from London who were prepared to pose nude. Although there was some resentment locally about this, the landowner, a Colonel Paynter, was fully supportive and allowed Knight and the other artists a free rein. Daughters of the Sun, which showed several women, some naked, sitting by a coastal inlet was completed in 1911 and well received when shown at the Royal Academy, but was subsequently damaged and destroyed. In recent years examples of Knight's plein-air compositions from Cornwall have attracted high prices at auction.|$|E
5|$|With the bow now irretrievably stuck, and {{the threat}} of even worse weather coming which could {{completely}} destroy the ship, White Star officials decided to attempt an unorthodox method of saving the stern half of the ship, which was not grounded nor damaged, by separating it from the damaged bow. Suevic, like other White Star liners, had been built with watertight compartments as a safety precaution. Depending on the integrity of this design, engineers used carefully placed charges of dynamite to sever the bow at a bulkhead just aft of the bridge on 4 April. This move was successful, and the aft half of the ship floated free. The watertight compartments held their integrity, and Suevic was able to steam under her own power, in reverse and guided by tugs, to Southampton. The damaged bow was left to break up <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Deserts {{are formed}} by {{weathering}} processes as large {{variations in temperature}} between day and night put strains <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>rocks</b> which consequently break in pieces. Although rain seldom occurs in deserts, there are occasional downpours that can result in flash floods. Rain falling on hot rocks can cause them to shatter and the resulting fragments and rubble strewn over the desert floor is further eroded by the wind. This picks up particles of sand and dust and wafts them aloft in sand or dust storms. Wind-blown sand grains striking any solid object in their path can abrade the surface. Rocks are smoothed down, and the wind sorts sand into uniform deposits. The grains end up as level sheets of sand or are piled high in billowing sand dunes. Other deserts are flat, stony plains where all the fine material has been blown away and the surface consists of a mosaic of smooth stones. These areas are known as desert pavements and little further erosion takes place. Other desert features include rock outcrops, exposed bedrock and clays once deposited by flowing water. Temporary lakes may form and salt pans may be left when waters evaporate. There may be underground sources {{of water in the}} form of springs and seepages from aquifers. Where these are found, oases can occur.|$|E
