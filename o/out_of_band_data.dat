5000|$|The {{original}} DOCSIS protocol supports {{only two}} way connectivity. A cable modem that {{is unable to}} acquire an upstream channel will give up and resume scanning for new channels. Likewise, persistent upstream errors will cause a cable modem to [...] "reinitialize its MAC" [...] and scan for new downstream channels. This behavior is appropriate for traditional cable modems, but not for cable set-top boxes. A cable set-top box still needs to acquire its <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>band</b> <b>data</b> even if the upstream channel is impaired.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Out</b> <b>of</b> <b>band</b> <b>data</b> is a logically {{independent}} {{transmission channel}} between {{a pair of}} connected stream sockets. In computer networking, out-of-band data is the data transferred through a stream that is independent from the main in-band data stream. An out-of-band data mechanism provides a conceptually independent channel, which allows any data sent via that mechanism to be kept separate from in-band data. The out-of-band data mechanism should be provided as an inherent characteristic of the data channel and transmission protocol, rather than requiring a separate channel and endpoints to be established. [...] The term [...] "out-of-band data" [...] probably derives from out-of-band signaling, as used in the telecommunications industry.|$|E

40|$|Despite of many {{advantages}} of OFDM, {{it has two}} main drawbacks which are high peak to average power ratio (PAPR) and synchronization problem. High PAPR causes saturation in power amplifiers, leading to intermodulation products among the sub carriers and disturbing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>band</b> energy. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the PAPR by means of PAPR reduction schemes. However, it caused the degradation of BER and enhanced the growth <b>of</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>band</b> radiation {{which has led to}} the degradation of OFDM overall performance In this paper, OFDM system with an enhanced clipping technique has been proposed, the effects of clipping have been analyzed and the system is evaluated by integrating with its significant features including convolutional forward error control coding, oversampled inverse fast fourier transform (IFFT) and digital filtering technique in order to minimize the effects of clipping. It is shown that the bit error rate (BER) of the clipped OFDM signal is improved, the PAPR is further reduced and the effect <b>of</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>band</b> radiation is minimized.
