5|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> is the {{practice}} of keeping the mouth clean and {{is a means of}} preventing dental caries, gingivitis, periodontal disease, bad breath, and other dental disorders. It consists of both professional and personal care. Regular cleanings, usually done by dentists and dental hygienists, remove tartar (mineralized plaque) that may develop even with careful brushing and flossing. Professional cleaning includes tooth scaling, using various instruments or devices to loosen and remove deposits from teeth.|$|E
5|$|Since most {{toothache}} is {{the result}} of plaque-related diseases, such as tooth decay and periodontal disease, the majority of cases could be prevented by avoidance of a cariogenic diet and maintenance of good <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene.</b> That is, reduction in the number times that refined sugars are consumed per day and brushing the teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and flossing. Regular visits to a dentist also increases the likelihood that problems are detected early and averted before toothache occurs. Dental trauma could also be significantly reduced by routine use of mouthguards in contact sports.|$|E

5|$|The {{purpose of}} {{cleaning}} teeth {{is to remove}} plaque, which consists mostly of bacteria. Healthcare professionals recommend regular brushing twice a day (in the morning and in the evening, or after meals) {{in order to prevent}} formation of plaque and tartar. A toothbrush is able to remove most plaque, except in areas between teeth. As a result, flossing is also considered a necessity to maintain <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene.</b> When used correctly, dental floss removes plaque from between teeth and at the gum line, where periodontal disease often begins and could develop caries.|$|E
5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene,</b> heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E
5|$|Tooth decay {{is caused}} by certain types of acid-producing {{bacteria}} which cause the most damage {{in the presence of}} fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special mineral content causes it to be sensitive to low pH. Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S., Speech Pathology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2014.

40|$|Early {{childhood}} caries (ECC), {{a disease}} characterized by tooth decay {{in the primary}} teeth of children, has become particularly burdensome in Aboriginal communities in Canada. Prevalence estimates of ECC range between 50 % and 100 %. Most concerning are the severe cases of ECC that require treatment with restorative surgery under general anesthesia. These surgeries often displace children and families from their local communities to specialty hospitals for treatment; further, they are very costly to dental insurance payers such as the government.

5|$|The {{long-term}} {{complications that}} result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the risk factors of {{the patient and the}} technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene.</b> The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss of retention to the teeth they are intended to support.|$|E
5|$|Pericoronitis is {{inflammation}} of the soft tissues surrounding the crown of a partially erupted tooth. The lower wisdom tooth is the last tooth to erupt into the mouth, and is, therefore, more frequently impacted, or stuck, against the other teeth. This leaves the tooth partially erupted into the mouth, and there frequently is a flap of gum (an operculum), overlying the tooth. Bacteria and food debris accumulate beneath the operculum, which {{is an area that}} is difficult to keep clean because it is hidden and far back in the mouth. The opposing upper wisdom tooth also tends to have sharp cusps and over-erupt because it has no opposing tooth to bite into, and instead traumatizes the operculum further. Periodontitis and dental caries may develop on either the third or second molars, and chronic inflammation develops in the soft tissues. Chronic pericoronitis may not cause any pain, but an acute pericoronitis episode is often associated with pericoronal abscess formation. Typical signs and symptoms of a pericoronal abscess include severe, throbbing pain, which may radiate to adjacent areas in the head and neck, redness, swelling and tenderness of the gum over the tooth. There may be trismus (difficulty opening the mouth), facial swelling, and rubor (flushing) of the cheek that overlies the angle of the jaw. Persons typically develop pericoronitis in their late teens and early 20s, as this is the age that the wisdom teeth are erupting. Treatment for acute conditions includes cleaning the area under the operculum with an antiseptic solution, painkillers, and antibiotics if indicated. After the acute episode has been controlled, the definitive treatment is usually by tooth extraction or, less commonly, the soft tissue is removed (operculectomy). If the tooth is kept, good <b>oral</b> <b>hygiene</b> is required to keep the area free of debris to prevent recurrence of the infection.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to analyse the causal relationship between construction of fixed bridge dentures and the intensity of halitosis manifestations, as well as to establish basic hygiene requirements for construction of fixed dentures which would completely exclude retention of food parti-cles and avoid bad breath. 48 patients (36 men and 12 women), who use fixed dentures for 2 – 10 years, have been involved in this research. 26 patients wore fixed bridge dentures made of punched tooth crowns, the other 22 patients wore cast fixed dentures. The obtained measurements of halitosis magni-tude point to the close connection between bad breath and the construction of fixed dentures. Fixed dentures with tooth crown laps, saddle intermediate parts, as well as denture constructions, which impede complex of mouth hygiene measures, cause bad breath. In this research, the condition of patients’ teeth, periodontium, and <b>oral</b> cavity <b>hygiene</b> have been evaluated as satisfactory; the tongue is not perceptebly coated, and patients etiologically have not experienced problems caused by respiratorial or gastrointestinal diseases. The examined patients have not complained of xerostomia problems.
