40|$|Analysis of the oil-absorption {{process in}} deep-fat fried potato {{cylinders}} (frying temperatures of 155 degreesC, 170 degreesC, and 185 degreesC) allowed to distinguish 3 oil fractions: structural oil (absorbed during frying), penetrated surface <b>oil</b> (<b>suctioned</b> during cooling), and surface oil. Results {{showed that a}} small amount of oil penetrates during frying because most of the oil was picked {{up at the end of}} the process, suggesting that oil uptake and water removal are not synchronous phenomena. After cooling, oil was located either on the surface of the chip or suctioned into the porous crust microstructure, with an inverse relationship between them for increasing frying times...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Hydraulic loader {{is a major}} {{equipment}} for the airport engineering, the high efficient excavation {{is closely related to}} the reliability of equipment. Due to severe environment in the construction site, the chassis hydraulic system has high failure rate in the loader. Based on the criticality matrix analysis, some fatal failure modes were traced, including the leakage of motor, the pollution of hydraulic <b>oil,</b> the <b>suction</b> air of pump. Through the reliability prediction analysis, the estimated reliability of the chassis hydraulic system is 0. 27, and mean time between failures of the system is 183 h, in addition, critical components in the system are also determined.

40|$|Metal {{spraying}} for coating industrial {{pieces and}} products are applied in different industrial fields. In these recent years, many researchers {{have focused on}} developing various metal spraying methods and their relevant conditions and characteristics. Metal spaying are applied for revamping and reforming new and worn out pieces. In the surface coating by metal spraying, metal particles shoots to the considered surface to make mechanical coating. The advantages of metal sprayed coating which makes this method more desirable for designers in industrial products are, surface uniformity, good porosity for <b>oil</b> <b>suction,</b> high solidity, adhesion to the base metal, resistance against acids and resistance against impact, rust, pressure and wear. In this paper, an investigation is made on different methods of metal spraying such as hot, cold and plasma spraying methods {{in addition to the}} advantages and the shortcomings of each one. In addition, the surface preparation for products are introduced...|$|E
40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{models that}} describe the immersion-frying {{period and the}} post-frying cooling period of an infinite slab or an infinite cylinder were solved and tested. Results were successfully compared with {{those found in the}} literature or obtained experimentally, and were discussed in terms of the hypotheses and simplifications made. The models were used as the basis of a sensitivity analysis. Simulations showed that a decrease in slab thickness and core heat capacity resulted in faster crust development. On the other hand, an increase in oil temperature and boiling heat transfer coefficient between the oil and the surface of the food accelerated crust formation. The model for oil absorption during cooling was analysed using the tested post-frying cooling equation to determine the moment in which a positive pressure driving force, allowing <b>oil</b> <b>suction</b> within the pore, originated. It was found that as crust layer thickness, pore radius and ambient temperature decreased so did the time needed to start the absorption. On the other hand, as the effective convective heat transfer coefficient between the air and the surface of the slab increased the required cooling time decreased. In addition, {{it was found that the}} time needed to allow oil absorption during cooling was extremely sensitive to pore radius, indicating the importance of an accurate pore size determination in future studies...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{highlighted}} {{the importance of}} the cooling period in oil absorption in deep-fat fried products. Specifically, it has been established that the largest proportion of oil which ends up into the food, is sucked into the porous crust region after the fried product is removed from the oil bath, stressing the importance of this time interval. The main objective of this paper was to develop a predictive mechanistic model {{that can be used to}} understand the principles behind post-frying cooling oil absorption kinetics, which can also help identifying the key parameters that affect the final oil intake by the fried product. The model was developed for two different geometries, an infinite slab and an infinite cylinder, and was divided into two main sub-models, one describing the immersion frying period itself and the other describing the post-frying cooling period. The immersion frying period was described by a transient moving-front model that considered the movement of the crust/core interface, whereas post-frying cooling oil absorption was considered to be a pressure driven flow mediated by capillary forces. A key element in the model was the hypothesis that <b>oil</b> <b>suction</b> would only begin once a positive pressure driving force had developed. The mechanistic model was based on measurable physical and thermal properties, and process parameters with no need of empirical data fitting, and can be used to study oil absorption in any deep-fat fried product that satisfies the assumptions made...|$|E
40|$|Often in oil {{reservoirs}} a {{layer of}} water lies under the layer of <b>oil.</b> The <b>suction</b> pressure due to a distribution of oil wells will cause the oil-water interface to rise up towards the wells. Given a particular distribution of oil wells, {{we are interested in}} finding the flow rates of each well that maximise the total flow rate without the interface breaking through to the wells. A method for finding optimal flow rates is developed using the Muskat model to approximate the interface height, and a version of the Nelder-Mead simplex method for optimisation. A variety of results are presented, including the perhaps nonintuitive result that it is better to turn off some oil wells when they are sufficiently close to one another. 1...|$|R

Barges were also used to deflect and recover <b>oil.</b> Two self-propelled <b>suction</b> barges were also used to vacuum oil from the water and store in the vessel. In total 150 people, 11 vacuum trucks, 3 cranes, 10 barges/towboats, and 20,000 feet of boom were used throughout the cleanup process.|$|R

Nautilus Minerals is in the advanced stages of commencing extraction from its Solwarra deposit, in the Bismarck Archipelago, and Neptune Minerals is at an earlier stage with its Rumble II West deposit, located on the Kermadec Arc, near the Kermadec Islands. Both {{companies are}} proposing using modified existing technology. Nautilus Minerals, in partnership with Placer Dome (now part of Barrick Gold), succeeded in 2006 in returning over 10 metric tons of mined SMS to the surface using modified drum cutters mounted on an ROV, a world first.

40|$|Screw {{compressors}} {{are commonly}} used for industrial and commercial gas processing and refrigeration. These machines {{are known to be}} able to admit mixtures of gasses and liquids to a certain concentration. In oil injected compressors, oil is mostly injected in the working domain to seal, cool and lubricate. But would the injection of atomized oil or other liquid in the suction of the compressor be useful for better control of the discharge temperature and reduction in energy consumption, is still to be determined. Similarly, liquid neutral to the process may be injected in an <b>oil</b> free compressor <b>suction</b> to help controlling discharge temperature. It can be erosive and corrosive to the compressor rotors. Therefore mapping a two phase suction flow of a screw compressor may help in understanding the means to improve compressors efficiency and reliability. This paper is the initial phase of PhD program to determine the multiphase flow characteristic at suction of twin screw compressors by means of experimental techniques. Review of most common and up to date measurement techniques in field of multiphase flow was carried out to determine their suitability and feasibility. Also Modelling of single and multiphase flow at the suction domain of a twin screw compressor were performed {{in order to have a}} better understanding of flow distribution. The research is performed on an oil free screw compressor with “N” rotor profiles of 128 mm and configuration of 3 / 5 lobes with L/D of 1. 6 and 93 mm centre distance. A simplified CFD model of only suction domain which reduces computational time was compared with the CFD model of the entire compressor and it was found that it predicts most of flow features with same accuracy. The experimental study which will be used to validate the CFD model has been presented...|$|R
