5|$|Another <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{insert a}} small pellet of {{medication}} into the urethra, but this requires higher doses than injections {{and may not}} be as effective. Topical medications to dilate the blood vessels have been used, but are not very effective or well tolerated. Electrical stimulation of efferent nerves at the S2 level can be used to trigger an erection that lasts as long as the stimulation does.|$|E
5|$|Debian offers {{different}} network installation methods. A minimal install of Debian {{is available}} via the netinst CD, whereby Debian is installed {{with just a}} base and later added software can be downloaded from the Internet. Another <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> boot the installer from the network.|$|E
5|$|A second <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{increase}} the amount of well-watered vegetation. These two options can be combined with the implementation of green roofs. Green roofs are excellent insulators during the warm weather months and the plants cool the surrounding environment. Air quality is improved as the plants absorb carbon dioxide with concomitant production of oxygen. The city of New York determined that the cooling potential per area was highest for street trees, followed by living roofs, light covered surface, and open space planting. From the standpoint of cost effectiveness, light surfaces, light roofs, and curbside planting have lower costs per temperature reduction.|$|E
5000|$|One option favoured by Diamandi <b>was</b> <b>to</b> put the Principality {{under the}} {{sovereignty}} of the Romanian Crown (as an associated [...] "free state"). Another <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> link the principality to the ruling Italian House of Savoy. None of these <b>options</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> realised.|$|R
50|$|Leonardo Márquez left Mexico City on March 30 with {{an army of}} 3,840 men and 17 {{artillery}} pieces. Díaz, {{knowing that}} Marquez <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> Puebla, realized he could not keep the site any longer. He had four options: The first <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> end the siege of Puebla and retreat to the south, {{in order to avoid}} a joint attack of Marquez and the defenders of the city. The second <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> leave the city and fight with Marquez before he reached Puebla, facing the possibility of being attacked by forces far superior to his at the front and rear. The third <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> leave the city and go to help in the siege of Querétaro, facing the same problem as the second option. Finally, the last <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> attack and capture Puebla.|$|R
25|$|Another <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> realign the A2100 {{north of}} the junction, but this <b>option</b> <b>was</b> less {{favourable}} due to environmental concerns.|$|R
5|$|Another <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{classify}} selection by {{the life}} cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split {{the life cycle}} into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age is reached, while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E
5|$|A {{geothermal}} heat pump can extract enough heat from shallow ground {{anywhere in the}} world to provide home heating, but industrial applications need the higher temperatures of deep resources. The thermal efficiency and profitability of electricity generation is particularly sensitive to temperature. The most demanding applications receive the greatest benefit from a high natural heat flux, ideally from using a hot spring. The next best <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> drill a well into a hot aquifer. If no adequate aquifer is available, an artificial one may be built by injecting water to hydraulically fracture the bedrock. This last approach is called hot dry rock geothermal energy in Europe, or enhanced geothermal systems in North America. Much greater potential may be available from this approach than from conventional tapping of natural aquifers.|$|E
5|$|Another way {{to measure}} {{the speed of light}} is to {{independently}} measure the frequency f and wavelength λ of an electromagnetic wave in vacuum. The value of c can then be found by using the relation c=fλ. One <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> measure the resonance frequency of a cavity resonator. If the dimensions of the resonance cavity are also known, these can be used to determine the wavelength of the wave. In 1946, Louis Essen and A.C. Gordon-Smith established the frequency for a variety of normal modes of microwaves of a microwave cavity of precisely known dimensions. The dimensions were established to an accuracy of about ±0.8μm using gauges calibrated by interferometry. As the wavelength of the modes was known from the geometry of the cavity and from electromagnetic theory, knowledge of the associated frequencies enabled a calculation of the speed of light.|$|E
5000|$|The first <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{demolish}} it {{in order}} to implement new buildings along the street.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>options</b> <b>were</b> {{examined}} <b>to</b> {{achieve the}} exit of the Danube valley {{in the direction}} of Hegau. One <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> leave the valley near Geisingen, the other choice <b>was</b> <b>to</b> exit near Immendingen. Gerwig chose the latter option, as it turned out to allow for less complex track construction.|$|R
5000|$|Options for {{different}} airport developments began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{examined in the}} mid-1960s. One <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> relocate the facility to a new site, with some locations up to 70 km from Sofia. [...] Another option involved extending the airport's area radically to the north-east and gradually removing {{the focus of the}} airport there. A third <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> develop substantially the same site. By the later 1980s, the authorities had settled on the last option.|$|R
25|$|An {{alternate}} <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use a wetland system, {{such as that}} of Veta la Palma in Spain.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find {{applications}} for the isotopes in nuclear waste so as to re-use them.|$|E
25|$|A {{self-healing}} concrete {{has been}} developed that can also last longer than conventional concrete. Another <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use hydrophobic concrete.|$|E
50|$|The {{next step}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> produce {{the car as}} a four-door saloon, which would be built using {{monocoque}} construction. Like most leading car manufacturers dating from before the Second World War, Škoda always built their cars using the traditional and well-proven front-engine and rear-wheel drive layout. However, Škoda decided to look at two alternative options. Their first <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> go for the more modern front-engine and front-wheel drive layout, and their second <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use the rear-engine and rear-wheel drive layout, if the first <b>option</b> <b>was</b> unsuccessful.|$|R

50|$|For the {{ordinary}} citizen though, especially in rural areas, {{often the only}} <b>options</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> cycle, walk or go by dugout canoe.|$|R
25|$|Another <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{sell the}} methane product as biogas. For example, biogas can be compressed, much like natural gas, {{and used to}} power motor vehicles.|$|E
25|$|As a result, many middle-class {{families}} {{have resorted to}} alternative methods of child care. A common <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> buy child care, such as day care providers and centers.|$|E
25|$|Yet another <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use a compose key (hardware-based or software-emulated). Pressing the compose key, then ~, {{and then}} n results in ñ. A capital N can be {{substituted}} to produce Ñ, {{and in most cases}} the order of ~ and n can be reversed.|$|E
5000|$|Before GarageBand 10, {{there was}} no MIDI export option, and the only <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> save files as [...]band or export to iTunes.|$|R

25|$|A new {{tidal energy}} design <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{construct}} circular retaining walls embedded with turbines that can capture the potential energy of tides. The created reservoirs {{are similar to}} those of tidal barrages, except that the location is artificial and does not contain a preexisting ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|Solving an {{asymmetric}} TSP graph can {{be somewhat}} complex. The {{following is a}} 3×3 matrix containing all possible path weights between the nodes A, B and C. One <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> turn an asymmetric matrix of size N into a symmetric matrix of size 2N.|$|E
25|$|These {{fish have}} always been sought after by some animal collectors, but {{catching}} them is difficult, because the only reasonable <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> make the eels tired by continually discharging their electricity. The fish's electric organs eventually become completely discharged, allowing the collector to wade into the water in comparative safety.|$|E
50|$|Engine <b>options</b> <b>were</b> similar <b>to</b> the {{previous}} year, although the Cutlass's V8 <b>option</b> <b>was</b> expanded <b>to</b> 350 cu. in. (5.7 L). The variable-pitch stator feature of both optional two-speed Jetaway and three-speed Turbo Hydra-matic automatic transmissions was discontinued.|$|R
40|$|Visceral {{leishmaniasis}} is {{a chronic}} parasitic disease associated with severe immune dysfunction. Treatment <b>options</b> <b>are</b> limited <b>to</b> relatively toxic drugs {{and there is}} no vaccine for humans available. Hence, there is an urgent need to better understand immune responses following infection with Leishmania species by studying animal models of disease and clinical samples from patients. Here, we review recent discoveries in these areas and highlight shortcomings in our knowledge that need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> addressed if better treatment <b>options</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> developed and effective vaccines designed...|$|R
50|$|For example, when a DJI call (bullish/long) <b>option</b> <b>is</b> 18,000 and the {{underlying}} DJI Index is priced at $18,050 {{then there is a}} $50 advantage even if the <b>option</b> <b>were</b> <b>to</b> expire today. This $50 is the intrinsic value of the option.|$|R
25|$|A final <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{modify the}} player, {{capturing}} the high resolution digital signals {{before they are}} fed to internal D/A converters and convert it to S/PDIF, giving full range digital (but only stereo) sound. There exist already do-it-yourself solutions for some players. There also exists an option to equip a DVD-A player with multiple S/PDIF outputs, for full resolution multichannel digital output.|$|E
25|$|A further <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> {{examine a}} state's {{willingness}} {{to act as}} a great power. As a nation will seldom declare that it is acting as such, this usually entails a retrospective examination of state conduct. As a result, this is of limited use in establishing the nature of contemporary powers, at least not without the exercise of subjective observation.|$|E
25|$|NARTH {{stated in}} 2012 that refusing to offer therapy aimed at {{change to a}} client who {{requests}} it, and telling them that their only <b>option</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> claim a gay identity, could also be considered ethically unacceptable. In 2012 the British Psychological Society issued a position statement opposing any treatments {{that are based on}} an assumption that non-heterosexual orientations are pathological.|$|E
50|$|The book <b>was</b> <b>optioned</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{directed}} by the English photographer Rankin.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, the government's {{preferred}} <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> use diesel trains {{running on}} biodiesel, its White Paper Delivering a Sustainable Railway, ruling out large-scale railway electrification {{for the following}} five years.|$|R
5000|$|The second <b>option</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> reconvert the {{railroad}} into a promenade, {{and to make}} use of the space under the vaults as well as of the dilapidated plots neighbouring the viaduct.|$|R
