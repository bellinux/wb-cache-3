40|$|Effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> plane {{vibration}} on large-size optical workpieces {{in continuous}} <b>polishing</b> is studied. <b>The</b> vibration equation was deduced based on <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> inclination between <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> plane and z-axis direction.

5|$|In {{analyzing}} the creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Polish</b> Legions, many historians {{have argued that}} Napoleon used the Poles {{as a source of}} recruits and had little desire to invest in the re-creation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Polish</b> state. Among the most notable of Napoleon's contemporary Polish detractors was Kościuszko, who refused to join the Legions, arguing that Napoleon would not restore Poland in any durable form. In this regard, Kościuszko also stated that the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 only because it was expedient, rather than because Napoleon supported Polish sovereignty. Nevertheless, the memory of Napoleon's Polish Legions is strong in Poland, and Napoleon himself is often regarded as a hero and liberator there. About the Polish Legion, Napoleon himself is reputed to have said that 800 Poles would equal 8,000 enemy soldiers.|$|E
40|$|Based on the Coulomb {{friction}} model, the frictional motion {{model of}} workpiece relating to <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> pad {{was presented in}} annular <b>polishing.</b> By <b>the</b> dynamic analysis software, the model was simulated and analysed. The conclusions from the results were that the workpiece did not rotate steadily. When <b>the</b> angular velocity <b>of</b> ring and <b>the</b> direction {{were the same as}} that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> pad, <b>the</b> angular velocity <b>of</b> workpiece hoicked at the beginning and at the later stage were the same as that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> pad before contacting with the ring. <b>The</b> angular velocity <b>of</b> workpiece vibrated at <b>the</b> moment <b>of</b> contacting with <b>the</b> ring. After that <b>the</b> angular velocity <b>of</b> workpiece increased gradually and fluctuated at a given value, while <b>the</b> angular velocity <b>of</b> ring decreased gradually and also fluctuated at a given value. Since the contact between the workpiece and the ring was linear, their linear velocities and directions should be the same. But <b>the</b> angular velocity <b>of</b> workpiece was larger than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>polishing</b> pad on <b>the</b> condition that <b>the</b> radius <b>of</b> <b>the</b> workpiece was less than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ring.
