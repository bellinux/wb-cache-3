500|$|Charlotte Brontë {{spent her}} honeymoon at Cuba Court in 1854 {{following}} {{her marriage to}} Arthur Bell Nicholls (See Charlotte Brontë). She noted of Cuba Court: [...] "It is very large and looks externally like a gentleman's country seat – within most of the rooms are lofty and spacious, and some – the drawing room and dining room are handsomely and commodiously furnished. The passages look desolate and bare – <b>our</b> <b>bedroom,</b> a great room of the ground floor, would have looked gloomy when we were shown into it but for the turf fire that was burning in the wide old chimney." ...|$|E
60|$|But it was {{different}} now. I kept a Colt's revolver loaded in the bureau drawer in <b>our</b> <b>bedroom.</b>|$|E
60|$|We keep Penini (in a bed this time) in <b>our</b> <b>bedroom.</b> He was so pathetic about it, {{we would}} not lose him.|$|E
60|$|We filled our glasses once more, drained {{them off}} meditatively, {{and turned into}} <b>our</b> <b>bedrooms</b> as the clock was {{striking}} four.|$|R
2500|$|When {{the police}} are in <b>our</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> shouldn't the courts go in after them?: An update on the fight against [...] "Sodomy" [...] laws, (with Robert S. Mower); 21 Fordham Urban Law Journal 997 (1994).|$|R
6000|$|It was agreed, of course. There was a door of {{communication}} between <b>our</b> <b>bedrooms.</b> At his suggestion it was left open. [...] "If I find I can't sleep," [...] he explained, [...] "I want to feel assured that {{you can hear me}} if I call to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|MABEL. How dare you? How dare you? Don't {{you know}} that I was in <b>our</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{all the time with}} the door open? Do you accuse me too? ...|$|E
60|$|After supper {{our host}} escorted us to <b>our</b> <b>bedroom,</b> an airy {{apartment}} adorned with various highly-coloured wood-carvings of a pious but somewhat ghastly character, calculated, I should say, to exercise a disturbing influence upon the night's rest of a nervous or sensitive person.|$|E
60|$|These things I beheld in {{the long}} marigold-scented {{twilight}} and whispering night, loafing round the little house with California, who un-folded himself like a lotus to the moon, or in the little boarded bunk that was <b>our</b> <b>bedroom,</b> swap-ping tales with Portland and the old man.|$|E
6000|$|... "'You needn't trouble yourself, Rosanna,' she said. 'The {{paint on}} Miss Rachel's door has been dry for hours. If Mr. Seegrave hadn't set a watch on <b>our</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> I might {{have told him}} as much. I don't know what you think--I was never so insulted before in my life!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{can go and}} {{experiment}} on the shorthorns at the farm, who are under proper control," [...] said Mrs. Cornett, [...] "or the elephants at the Zoological Gardens. They're said to be highly intelligent, and they have this recommendation, that they don't come creeping about <b>our</b> <b>bedrooms</b> and under chairs, and so forth." ...|$|R
50|$|Alan Nathan is {{a centrist}} US {{radio talk show}} host and columnist. He starts his shows with the mantra: We want the Republicans out of <b>our</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> the Democrats out of our wallets, and both out of our First and Second Amendment rights! and {{describes}} himself as The Militant Moderate. He has sometimes been labeled as libertarian.|$|R
6000|$|... "And then pin {{them up on}} <b>our</b> <b>bedroom</b> walls, where we'll {{see them}} every day," [...] {{suggested}} the Story Girl, [...] "and every time we break a resolution we must put a cross opposite it. That will show us what progress we are making, as well as make us ashamed if {{we have too many}} crosses." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Our</b> <b>bedroom</b> has {{two great}} glass bird-cages (enclosed balconies) one {{looking toward the}} Rhine valley and sunset, the other looking up the Neckar cul-de-sac, and {{naturally}} we spend nearly all our time in these--when one is sunny the other is shady. We have tables and chairs in them; we do our reading, writing, studying, smoking and suppering in them.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{one other}} thing, Arthur. You {{sent out to}} Mr Critchett--do you remember?--the night you first came home. I think, too, after the first awful shock, when {{we were sitting in}} <b>our</b> <b>bedroom,</b> you {{actually}} referred to--to violent measures. You will promise me, I may perhaps at least ask that, you will promise me on your word of honour, for Alice's sake, if not for mine, to do nothing rash.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Billy Polard is {{one such}} artist. Polard used looping [...]gif files created in and {{exported}} from Flipnote Studio. For his song Losing Light, Polard's music video told a sad story about two monsters. A year later, Polard released a music video for another song, When <b>Our</b> <b>Bedrooms</b> Were Once Haunted, that was also created in Flipnote Studio.|$|R
60|$|Madame Fontaine's flow of eloquence {{suddenly}} ran dry. She {{was silent}} as we ascended {{from the first}} floor to the second. In {{this part of the}} house <b>our</b> <b>bedrooms</b> were situated. The chamber in which I slept presented nothing particularly worthy of notice. But the rooms occupied by Mr. Keller and Mr. Engelman contained some of the finest carved woodwork in the house.|$|R
5000|$|... "Eathsick was {{recorded}} on many devices {{over the course}} of two years 2001 to 2003 by subtle in <b>our</b> <b>bedrooms...</b> on <b>our</b> rooftops... and so on... mixed on our computers...we took things from what we thought was wrong with the world, it being a sickness to live...these songs were released on the four season ep's along with their brother and sister songs which are now out of print..." ...|$|R
6000|$|I wish to {{goodness}} {{you were}} here this moment--nobody in our parlor but Livy and me,--and a very good view of London to the fore. We have a luxuriously ample suite of apartments in the Langham Hotel, 3rd floor, <b>our</b> <b>bedroom</b> looking straight up Portland Place and our parlor having a noble array of great windows looking out upon both streets (Portland Place and the crook that joins it to Regent Street.) ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next day}} {{commenced}} as before, {{getting up and}} dressing by rushlight; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing; {{the water in the}} pitchers was frozen. A change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind, whistling through the crevices of <b>our</b> <b>bedroom</b> windows all night long, had made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you about last night. You are aware, perhaps, that in this house all the {{servants}} sleep in the modern wing. This central block {{is made up of}} the dwelling-rooms, with the kitchen behind and <b>our</b> <b>bedroom</b> above. My maid, Theresa, sleeps above my room. There is no one else, and no sound could alarm those who are in the farther wing. This must have been well known to the robbers, or they would not have acted as they did.|$|E
40|$|Our {{lives are}} often shaped and made {{meaningful}} by {{the stars and}} celebrities who enter them. <b>Our</b> <b>bedrooms</b> can become shrines of longing, identification and desire, and the friends we make and the lovers we take can gravitate around the famous figure we together so admire. For the writers of this piece, David Bowie is one such star-man: his music, lyrics, writings and performances are felt to wrap themselves around their youth, their rebellion, their hurt, and their love...|$|R
60|$|Detestable weather {{detained}} me long at the hospitable factory. Tornadoes were {{of almost}} daily occurrence --not pleasant with 200 barrels of gunpowder under a thatched roof; they were useful chiefly to the Mpongwe servants of the establishment. These model thieves broke open, {{under cover of}} the storms, a strong iron safe in an inner room which had been carefully closed; they stole my Mboko skin, and bottles were not safe from them even in <b>our</b> <b>bedrooms.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Specter {{introduced}} legislation {{to clarify that}} {{it is illegal to}} capture silent visual images inside a person's home. [...] Specter said: [...] "... a very significant invasion of privacy with these webcams ..." [...] … us expect to [...] … video surveillance when we leave our homes and go out each day—at the ATM, at traffic lights, or in stores … we do not expect is … surveillance in our homes, in <b>our</b> <b>bedrooms</b> … we do not expect it for our children in our homes.|$|R
6000|$|Primeau's home {{ranch and}} store which we reached about eleven the next forenoon {{was an almost}} equally sorry place for a {{delicate}} woman, a sad spot in which to spend even a single night. Flies swarmed in the kitchen like bees, and the air of <b>our</b> <b>bedroom</b> was hot and stagnant, and mosquitoes made sleep impossible. Zulime became ill, and I bitterly regretted my action in bringing her into this God forsaken land. [...] "We shall return at once to the fort," [...] I promised her.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{just seen}} {{a sort of}} ground-plan of the castle," [...] said Miss Elsie cheerfully. [...] "It never had a room in it as big as <b>our</b> <b>bedroom</b> in the hotel, and there weren't windows enough to go round. A slit in the wall, about two inches wide by two feet long, was {{considered}} dazzling extravagance to Malcolm's ancestors. I don't wonder some of 'em broke out and swam over to America. That reminds me. Who do you suppose is here--came over from the hotel in a boat of his own, just to see maw!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Well, on {{the night}} in {{question}} (and, {{if you wish to}} know the precise date, it was the 31st of September last), after having some little conversation with Mr. Sterne in <b>our</b> <b>bedroom,</b> I must have got up, though I protest I don't know how, and come down stairs with him into the coffee-room of the [...] "Hotel Dessein," [...] where the moon was shining, and a cold supper was laid out. I forget what we had--"vol-au-vent d'oeufs de Phenix--agneau aux pistaches a la Barmecide,"--what matters what we had? ...|$|E
60|$|We had a nasty {{crossing}} here. We left Holyhead at {{one in the}} morning, and {{got here}} at six. Arthur was incessantly sick the whole way. I was not sick at all, but was in as healthy a condition otherwise as humanity need be. We are in a beautiful hotel. Our sitting-room is exactly like the drawing-room at the Peschiere in all its dimensions. I never saw two rooms so exactly resembling one another in their proportions. <b>Our</b> <b>bedrooms</b> too are excellent, and there are baths {{and all sorts of}} comforts.|$|R
6000|$|... "I left him, {{drinking}} hard, to put <b>our</b> two <b>bedrooms</b> tidy for the night. The {{place that}} his bed {{happened to be}} set in (which I had never remarked particularly before) seemed, {{in a manner of}} speaking, to force itself on my notice now.|$|R
5000|$|Specter then {{introduced}} legislation in April 2010 {{to amend the}} federal Wiretap Act to clarify that {{it is illegal to}} capture silent visual images inside another person's home. He said: [...] "This is going to become law. You have a very significant invasion of privacy with these webcams, as more information is coming to light." [...] Speaking {{on the floor of the}} Senate, he said: [...] Many of us expect to be subject to ... video surveillance when we leave our homes and go out each day—at the ATM, at traffic lights, or in stores, for example. What we do not expect is to be under visual surveillance in our homes, in <b>our</b> <b>bedrooms,</b> and, most especially, we do not expect it for our children in our homes.|$|R
60|$|When we {{had changed}} our wet clothes and drunk {{a glass of}} pale ale to the Club's prosperity, one of their number escorted us to an hotel. He would not join us at our dinner, {{but he had no}} {{objection}} to a glass of wine. Enthusiasm is very wearing; and I begin to understand why prophets were unpopular in Judaea, where they were best known. For three stricken hours did this excellent young man sit beside us to dilate on boats and boat-races; and before he left, he was kind enough to order <b>our</b> <b>bedroom</b> candles.|$|E
60|$|You {{would wonder}} almost how I {{could feel the}} cold in these two rooms opening into each other, and from which I have not stirred since the cold weather began. Robert has kept up the fire in <b>our</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{throughout}} the night. Oh, he has been spoiling me so. If {{it had not been}} that I feared much to hurt him in having him so disturbed and worried, {{it would have been a}} very subtle luxury to me, this being ill and feeling myself dear. Do not set me down as too selfish. May God bless him!...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{might have}} seen {{something}} like it had {{you ever been in}} the house of one of our rich London traders, Agnes; at least so I have heard, though in truth I have never myself been in so luxuriously furnished a room. I only hope that we may stay here for some time. The best of it is that these good people evidently do not regard us as a burden. No doubt they are pleased to oblige the Duke of Burgundy, but, beyond that, their welcome seemed really sincere. Now let us see <b>our</b> <b>bedroom.</b> I suppose that is yours, Charlie, through the door in the corner." ...|$|E
5000|$|On July 21, 2009, Four Year Strong {{released}} covers album, titled Explains It All. The album features guest appearances from Keith Buckley of Every Time I Die, Travis McCoy of Gym Class Heroes, and JR and Buddy of Less Than Jake. The band explained their reasoning {{behind the}} album in a MySpace blog, saying [...] "It's what {{we grew up}} listening to. Everyone has those songs that instantly transport you back to when you were younger. Whether we were in <b>our</b> <b>bedrooms</b> playing air guitar, or riding in the car to little league practice, or {{it was just that}} song that was all over the radio during that awesome summer at the Cape. These songs have impacted us in some way and we want to share that feeling with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The third {{happened}} in Malta. We {{were in a}} fortress there; and as it happened <b>our</b> <b>bedrooms</b> overlooked the open sea, which almost came up to our window-sills, save for a flat white outer wall as bare as the sea. I woke up again; {{but it was not}} dark. There was a full moon, as I walked to the window; I could have seen a bird on the bare battlement, or a sail on the horizon. What I did see was a sort of stick or branch circling, self-supported, in the empty sky. It flew straight in at my window and smashed the lamp beside the pillow I had just quitted. It was one of those queer-shaped war-clubs some Eastern tribes use. But it had come from no human hand." ...|$|R
60|$|We moved down-stairs; {{but there}} was no place there to stow the nurse, and Mrs. McWilliams said the nurse's {{experience}} would be an inestimable help. So we returned, bag and baggage, to <b>our</b> own <b>bedroom</b> once more, and felt a great gladness, like storm-buffeted birds that have found their nest again.|$|R
