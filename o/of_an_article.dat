5|$|From Russia, with Love {{received}} broadly positive reviews at {{the time}} of publication. The book's sales were boosted by an advertising campaign that played upon a visit by the British Prime Minister Anthony Eden to Fleming's Goldeneye estate, and the publication <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> in Life, which listed From Russia, with Love as one of US President John F. Kennedy's ten favourite books. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper, first in an abridged, multi-part form and then as a comic strip. In 1963 it was adapted into the second film in the Bond series, starring Sean Connery.|$|E
5|$|At the time, hadrosaurids {{were thought}} to have been aquatic animals, and Kräusel made a point of stating that the {{specimen}} did not rule out hadrosaurids eating water plants. The discovery of possible gut contents made little impact in English-speaking circles, except for another brief mention of the aquatic-terrestrial dichotomy, until it was brought up by John Ostrom in the course <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> reassessing the old interpretation of hadrosaurids as water-bound. Instead of trying to adapt the discovery to the aquatic model, he used it as a line of evidence that hadrosaurids were terrestrial herbivores. While his interpretation of hadrosaurids as terrestrial animals has been generally accepted, the Senckenberg plant fossils remain equivocal. Kenneth Carpenter has suggested that they may actually represent the gut contents of a starving animal, instead of a typical diet. Other authors have noted that because the plant fossils were removed from their original context in the specimen and were heavily prepared, it is no longer possible to follow up on the original work, leaving open the possibility that the plants were washed-in debris.|$|E
5|$|In 1821, {{the year}} that the War of Independence broke out, nine issues {{appeared}} between January and May. There is a special appendix {{to the issue of}} April 1, 1821, containing a Greek translation <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>article</b> dated March 29, taken from the Wiener Zeitung, which reports on the uprising of Alexandros Ypsilantis and Tudor Vladimirescu in the Danubian Principalities, that {{marked the beginning of the}} Greek War of Independence, and also states the official Austrian standpoint. In the issue of May 1, while Ypsilantis’ campaign was in full swing, the Austrian authorities required the editors to publish the excommunication issued by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, Gregory V, against the architects of this uprising. This was the last issue of Hermes o Logios which then was closed down by the local authorities and Kokkinakis was arrested as a member of the patriotic organization Filiki Etaireia.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Publication bias is the {{tendency}} for investigations with primarily nonstatis-tically significant findings to be withheld from the research record. Because publication bias has serious negative consequences for research and practice, we gathered informa-tion about the prevalence and predictors of publication bias in the computer science education literature. From an initial random sample of 352 recent computer science education articles, we reviewed the 38 empirical articles that used inferential statistical analyses. We found that (<b>a)</b> the proportion <b>of</b> <b>articles</b> reporting primarily statistically significant findings in computer science education was {{very similar to the}} proportion in medical research, (b) that <b>an</b> <b>article’s</b> having <b>a</b> female first author was <b>a</b> strong predictor <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>article’s</b> having primarily statistically significant results, and (c) that there was a tendency for authors to emphasize statistically significant findings and deemphasize nonstatistically significant findings. Neither whether an investigation was reported in a journal or conference proceeding nor whether the source of funding was disclosed were significant predictors <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>article’s</b> having statistically positive results...|$|R
