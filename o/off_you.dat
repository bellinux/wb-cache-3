500|$|Misinterpreted as a {{traditional}} love song about a femme fatale by most R audiences, [...] "Brown Sugar" [...] is an ode to marijuana use through its use of the personification of a brown-skinned woman. This thematic substitution is a conventional lyrical technique in hip hop. Shapiro wrote of the song's lyrical content, stating [...] "D'Angelo was extolling the pleasures of pot-fuelled solipsism ('Always down for a ménage-à-trois/But I think I'ma hit it solo/Hope my niggaz don't mind') and intimating that love, or at least love of the herb, leads to insanity ('Brown sugar babe/I gets high <b>off</b> <b>you</b> love/Don't know how to behave')." [...] Writer and academic Todd Boyd compared the song, along with Dr. Dre's The Chronic (1992) and Styles P's [...] "Good Times" [...] (2002), to Rick James's [...] "Mary Jane" [...] (1978), stating that the song [...] "celebrated his love for gettin' blazed and spawned ... a truly large following." ...|$|E

Then, I told my friend Joe, who did the art. He always had an obsession with Marie Antoinette too. She was also decapitated. We also thought about Jayne Mansfield, just {{the idea of a}} woman having her mouth and eyes and ears taken away from her. And, hand grenades, the top comes <b>off.</b> <b>You</b> just pull out the pin and it explodes. So, if you take away someone's mouth and their eyes and their senses and their brain, they explode.

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} {{began in}} the summer of 2012 in The Hamptons, New York, where Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z were living. She invited producers and songwriters to accompany them, including Sia, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake and The-Dream. Beyoncé described the atmosphere as unconventional, saying, [...] "we had dinners with the producers every day, like a family... it was like a camp. Weekends <b>off.</b> <b>You</b> could go and jump in the pool and ride bikes... the ocean and grass and sunshine... it was really a safe place." [...] She would spend the majority of her day with her newborn daughter, taking some hours out to record music. The album's opening track [...] "Pretty Hurts", co-written by Sia, was completed during these sessions. The project was suspended until 2013 and relocated to New York City's Jungle City and Oven studios where most of the album was recorded. In an interview for Vogue in January 2013, Jason Gay described Beyoncé's attention to detail as [...] "obsessive" [...] when observing her studio, noting the vision boards she created for inspiration, which contained potential song titles, old album covers and pictures of performances.|$|E
500|$|When Fiasco was 18, {{he began}} {{creating}} {{music as a}} solo artist in his father's basement, even though his parents were not keen on having their son be a rapper. He scoured flea markets and secondhand stores, where {{he was able to}} find an old mixing board and a record player, stacks of vinyl records, and mic stands. [...] At age 19, Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak, which was influenced by other California gangsta rappers such as Spice 1 and Ice Cube. Da Pak signed to Epic Records and released one single before splitting up. Fiasco later described the experience, saying [...] "We had a song out about cocaine, guns, and women, and I would go to a record store and look at it and think, 'What are you doing?'

During {{an interview with}} Elle, Kills talked on the concept she went with for the visual. Kills revealed that she left her birthplace of Bradford in England {{at the age of}} 14, in order to pursue her desire of having a better life, with a good boyfriend and life; however she only felt [...] "closer to betterness" [...] in parties, where she was exposed to recreational drugs. She started to consume them and she felt better with them for [...] "a few short hours". [...] "They make you feel better, so the minute the high wears <b>off</b> <b>you</b> want more. But what's wrong with wanting more?", Kills reflected. [...] "More happiness, more power or freedom or love if you know that it's obtainable without the hard work, rejection and bullshit? [...] Sometimes it feels that reality is bad—much worse than the drug that helps you escape it for a few short hours." [...] She further explained that she wanted to create an [...] "honest video that showed both [...] realities with all the disaster, delusion, and desire." [...] The video was released on 19 February 2014 on Kills' Vevo and YouTube accounts.|$|E
500|$|Foster {{signed for}} League Two side Rotherham United on 20 June 2011. He signed a one-year {{contract}} with the club, with an option of a second year. Foster made his debut for the club in a 3–0 home victory against Gillingham on 27 August 2011, coming on as an 84th-minute substitute with Rotherham already holding a three-goal advantage. After making no further first-team appearances the following month, Foster was made available for loan by manager Andy Scott. Scott stated Foster lacked both desire and fitness since signing for the club — [...] "If {{you want to be}} match fit, you get yourself match fit. You can work in training, you can stay behind, you have days <b>off,</b> <b>you</b> can get yourself fit. Luke has not been in the side and that tells you everything you need to know". However, no loan move materialised, and Foster made his second appearance for Rotherham in a 3–3 away draw at Morecambe on 25 October 2011. He appeared as a 27th-minute substitute in the club's following match four days later, a 1–1 draw against Northampton Town, and subsequently made his first start in a 2–0 home victory over Aldershot Town on 5 November — Rotherham's first win in 10 matches. In December 2011, Rotherham manager Andy Scott revealed that Foster would miss the rest of the 2011–12 season {{as a result of a}} cruciate ligament damage sustained in a match against Hereford United on 10 December 2011. He was released by Rotherham in May 2012, having made six appearances for the club.|$|E
500|$|Cryer's {{long run}} of {{unsuccessful}} TV projects finally ended three years later. Against {{the wishes of}} CBS executives (who were aware of his past failures) and due to a friendship with Charlie Sheen, he was cast in 2003 to portray Alan Harper on the hit comedy series Two and a Half Men. He has earned seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations and two wins for his acting work on the show. In a comment on the show's high ratings, he said: [...] "When you’re on a show that's fighting for survival every week, you stop trusting your instincts, because you think, ‘My instincts haven't worked so far.’ But when people clearly like the show and are watching it in great numbers, it takes {{a huge amount of}} pressure <b>off</b> <b>you.</b> It allows you to trust your instincts and go with what has worked for you before." [...] After former co-star Charlie Sheen's departure from the series, Cryer's character became the show's main protagonist (with Ashton Kutcher being cast as the co-lead) throughout the final four seasons, mainly due to the show's retooled plot. At the end of the series of Two and a Half Men, Cryer is the only actor to have appeared in every episode of the series, since Sheen was fired in March 2011 and his on-screen son Angus T. Jones left the series at the end of season 10, after expressing the show as [...] "filth" [...] and that Jones is a [...] "paid hypocrite". All appeared to be forgiven, however, as Jones, contrary to Charlie Sheen, appeared to great applause in the finale. [...] Before being cast for Two and a Half Men, Cryer auditioned for the role of Gaius Baltar on the Sci-Fi Channel's reimagined Battlestar Galactica, but the role went to James Callis. In 2008, Cryer appeared with Laurence Fishburne and James Cromwell in the film Tortured, and in 2009 co-starred with James Spader in the film Shorts.|$|E

500|$|Another {{prominent}} {{artist was}} Tetsuya Nomura. Having impressed Sakaguchi with his proposed ideas, which were handwritten and illustrated {{rather than simply}} typed on a PC, Nomura was brought on as main character designer. Talking of his role as character designer, Nomura stated {{that when he was}} brought on, the main scenario had not been completed, but he [...] "went along like, 'I guess first <b>off</b> <b>you</b> need a hero and a heroine', and from there drew the designs while thinking up details about the characters. After [...] done the hero and heroine, [...] carried on drawing by thinking what kind of characters would be interesting to have. When [...] handed over the designs [...] tell people the character details [...] thought up, or write them down on a separate sheet of paper". Something that could not be carried over from earlier titles was the chibi sprite art, as that would not fit with the new graphical direction. Naora, in his role as an assistant character designer and art director, helped adjust each character's appearance so the actions they performed were believable. When designing Cloud and Sephiroth, Nomura was influenced by his view of their rivalry mirroring the legendary animosity between Miyamoto Musashi and Sasaki Kojirō, with Cloud and Sephiroth being Musashi and Kojirō respectively. Sephiroth's look was defined as [...] "kakkoii", a Japanese term combining good looks with coolness. Several of Nomura's designs evolved substantially during development. Cloud's original design of slicked-back black hair with no spikes was intended to serve as a contrast to Sephiroth's long, flowing silver hair in addition to saving polygons. Nomura feared, however, that such masculinity could prove unpopular with fans, and therefore he changed Cloud's design to feature a shock of spiky, bright blond hair. Vincent changed from researcher to detective to chemist, and finally to the figure of a former Turk with a tragic past.|$|E
