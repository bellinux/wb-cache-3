50|$|The Government Telephone Preference Scheme (GTPS) is a British {{system for}} {{limiting}} <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> from landlines if {{the network is}} overloaded during an emergency.

50|$|The {{similarly}} named Government Telephone Preference Scheme {{is quite}} different; it {{is a system}} used since 1952 by the General Post Office and its successor British Telecom for disabling <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> from all landlines if the telephone network is overloaded during an emergency; only vital lines which are registered with the scheme may make <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> when it is activated.|$|R

5000|$|Automatic number {{announcement}} {{systems are}} based on automatic number identification, and meant for phone company technicians, the ANAC system works with unlisted numbers, numbers with caller ID blocking, and numbers with no <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> allowed. Installers of multi-line business services where <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> from all lines display the company's main number on call display can use ANAC to identify a specific line in the system, even if CID displays every line as [...] "line one".|$|R
5000|$|At the end {{of either}} an {{incoming}} or <b>outgoing</b> <b>call,</b> the PBX initiates disconnect by going on hook, or the central office initiates disconnect by opening tip. When the other end detects the loss of loop current, it also goes on hook and the call clears normally.|$|E
5000|$|Founded in 2006, WorldSIM {{was created}} to reduce {{the high costs of}} using mobile phones while {{travelling}} overseas. They developed a unique SIM card that enabled users to select the region they are located in to access free incoming calls while overseas and reduced <b>outgoing</b> <b>call</b> costs.|$|E
50|$|The {{call setup}} request message is handled next by the Mobile Switching Center, which checks the subscriber's record {{held in the}} Visitor Location Register {{to see if the}} <b>outgoing</b> <b>call</b> is allowed. If so, the MSC then routes the call {{in the same way that}} a {{telephone}} exchange does in a fixed network.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States and Canada, callers pay {{the cost}} of {{connecting}} to the Gateway MSC of the subscriber's phone company, regardless of the actual location of the phone. As mobile numbers are given standard geographic numbers according to the North American Numbering Plan, callers pay the same to reach fixed phones and mobile phones in a given geographic area. Mobile subscribers pay for the connection time (typically using in-plan or prepaid minutes) for both incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls.</b> For <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls,</b> any long distance charges are billed as if they originate at the GMSC, {{even though it is}} the visiting MSC that completes the connection to the PSTN. Plans that include nationwide long distance and/or nationwide roaming at no additional charge over [...] "local" [...] <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> are popular.|$|R

50|$|Time capture is {{the concept}} of making sense of time-related data based on {{timestamps}} generated by system software. Software that run on PCs and other digital devices rely on internal software clocks to generate timestamps. In turn, these timestamps {{serve as the basis for}} representing when an event has occurred (i.e. when an <b>outgoing</b> <b>call</b> was made), and for how long that event lasted (i.e. the duration of a phone call).|$|E
50|$|When {{sufficient}} digits {{had been}} received, the MCU {{would have been}} able to determine the required path through the exchange, the routing digits to be sent (if an <b>outgoing</b> <b>call</b> is indicated), and which of the received digits have to be repeated forward. It would advise the register accordingly and then set the paths necessary to allow the register to signal forward and finally extend the caller to the required number or junction.|$|E
50|$|The {{corresponding}} {{service to}} DID for <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> from a PBX {{to the central}} office exchange is called direct outward dialing (DOD) or Direct Dial Central Office (DDCO). This service is often combined with DID service and allows direct dialing of global telephone numbers by every extension covered by the service without the assistance of an operator. The caller line identification (CLI) or caller-id of extensions for <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> is often set to the extension DID number, but may be the organization's central switch board number.|$|R

Function calls can be mapped by their absolute numbers, their normalized absolute numbers, or their rank. FuncMap should be useful for comparing packages {{at a high level}} for their overall design. Plus, it's just plain fun. The hive plot concept was developed by Martin Krzywinski (www. hiveplot. com) and inspired this package...|$|R

His dream is to become a great public Denwan someday. (Den means phone and WanWan is the sound a dog makes so he is basically a blue Phone dog.) He is, however, a pay phone...you have to pay him to make an <b>outgoing</b> <b>call.</b> Also, his dial only has seven digits.|$|E
50|$|The {{more limited}} {{three-way}} calling is available (usually at an extra charge) on home or office phone lines. For a three-way call, the first called party is dialed. Then the hook flash button (or recall button) is pressed {{and the other}} called party's phone number is dialed. While it is ringing, flash/recall is pressed again to connect the three people together. This option allows callers to add a second <b>outgoing</b> <b>call</b> to an already connected call.|$|E

This info will be shown in all outgoing calls as it rings on screen of the receiving end. When the call ends, the receiver, through the call end dialogue, may also choose to view more information regarding the number.|$|E
