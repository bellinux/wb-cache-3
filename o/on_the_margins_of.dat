Van Eyck's early works display a predilection for inscriptions, which serve a dual purpose. They are decorative while also functioning {{in a manner similar}} to the commentaries often seen <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> medieval manuscripts which set in context the significance of the accompanying imagery. Diptychs were usually commissioned for private devotion, and van Eyck would have expected the viewer to contemplate text and imagery in unison.|$|E
5|$|Indraloris {{is known}} only from {{isolated}} teeth and {{fragments of the}} mandible. These show that Indraloris was a medium-sized sivaladapid, somewhat smaller than Sivaladapis. In 1982, Gingerich and colleagues estimated that Indraloris himalayensis may have weighed 3.7 to 4.3kg (8.2 to 9.5lb) {{on the basis of}} allometric scaling of tooth size; Flynn and Morgan estimated a body size of about 2kg (4.4lb) for I.kamlialensis. In general, the cingula (shelves) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> the cheekteeth are weak in Indraloris. Among the two named species, I.kamlialensis is about 20% smaller than I.himalayensis. The unnamed large Indraloris is similar in size to I.himalayensis.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographic}} {{growth that}} occurred in Sélestat after 1945 was primarily due to a relatively high birth rate (20.1‰ in Sélestat over the period 1968–1975, compared to 16.9‰ in France). After 1975, this rate progressively declined to match the national figure. Net migration figures remained slightly negative until 1990 because Sélestat and Central Alsace were <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> the metropolitan areas of Strasbourg and Colmar and lacked attractivity. Since 1990, the Strasbourg area greatly expanded to gradually reach Sélestat. The town has thus become more attractive to newcomers.|$|E

5|$|Utah {{and western}} Colorado were {{deformed}} as {{the rate of}} subduction off the west coast increased in the Middle Jurassic Sevier Orogeny. At the same time, an inland sea began to encroach on the continent from the north. Broad tidal flats and streams carrying iron oxide-rich mud formed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> the shallow sea to the west, creating the Sinawava member of the Temple Cap Formation. Flat-bedded sandstones, siltstones, and limestones filled depressions left in the underlying eroded strata. Streams eroded the poorly cemented Navajo Sandstone, and water caused the sand to slump.|$|E

25|$|The {{ancestors}} of most modern ponies developed small stature because they lived <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> livable horse habitat. These smaller animals were domesticated and bred for various purposes {{all over the}} Northern Hemisphere.

In an attempt to amass a water supply, Murair Fort was constructed 1.8km eastward of the original settlement, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> the desert scarp.

After it was discovered that he was drawing sea serpents, mermaids, and whales <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> the maps, he was transferred to the etching division of the U. S. Coast Survey. He lasted there only two months, but he learned the etching technique which later proved valuable to his career.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that fully melting Antarctica would contribute over 60 metres of sea level rise, and Greenland would contribute more than 7 metres. Small glaciers and ice caps <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> Greenland and the Antarctic Peninsula might contribute about 0.5 metres. The latter figure is much smaller than for Antarctica or Greenland, but it could occur relatively quickly (within the coming century), whereas full melting of Greenland would be slow (perhaps 1,500 years to fully deglaciate at the fastest likely rate) and Antarctica even slower. However, this calculation {{does not account for}} the possibility of accelerate melting as meltwater flows under and lubricates the larger ice sheets, which would begin to move much more rapidly towards the sea.|$|E

25|$|Most Nepenthes species grow in {{environments that}} provide high {{humidity}} and precipitation and moderate to high light levels. A few species, including N.ampullaria, prefer the dense, shaded forests, but most other species thrive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> tree/shrub communities or clearings. Some species (e.g. N.mirabilis) {{have been found}} growing in clear-cut forest areas, roadsides, and disturbed fields. Other species have adapted to growing in savanna-like grass communities. The soils in which Nepenthes species grow are usually acidic and low in nutrients, being composed of peat, white sand, sandstone, or volcanic soils. Exceptions to these generalities include species that thrive in soils with high heavy metal content (e.g. N.rajah), on sandy beaches in the sea spray zone (e.g. N.albomarginata). Other species grow on inselbergs and as lithophytes, while others, such as N.inermis, can grow as epiphytes with no soil contact.|$|E
25|$|In the Sahel, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>margins</b> <b>of</b> the Hamitic nucleus in the {{northwest}} and northeast, several populations speaking non-Hamitic languages yet possessing some Hamitic physical and cultural affinities could be found. Among these were the Fulani, who were {{believed to have been}} of Berber origin. Beginning in the late medieval period, as they assimilated into the burgeoning states of the Western Sudan, the Fulani are thought to have gradually adopted the Niger-Congo tongue of their urban neighbors. As a result, the Hamitic element was most marked among the Bororo and other pastoral Fulani groups rather than in the Fulanin Gidda settled communities. Similarly, the Toubou of the Tibesti Mountains were held to have descended from the ancient Garamantes. This Hamitic ancestry was believed to be most salient among the northern Teda Toubou, as the southern Daza Toubou often intermarried with the adjacent Nilotic populations.|$|E
25|$|Since TICAD V, Japan has {{actively}} deployed its diplomacy toward Africa {{in order to}} maintain the momentum and to steadily implement its pledges.

In addition, from November 24 to December 5, 2013, Japan dispatched a Public and Private Sector Joint Mission for Promoting Trade and Investment for Africa to the Republic of the Congo, the Gabonese Republic, and Côte d'Ivoire. Thus, Japan hopes to further develop its relations with Africa through such follow-up measures to TICAD V. Furthermore, Prime Minister Abe visited three African countries in January 2014, fulfilling his promise at TICAD V to visit Africa in the near future.|$|E
