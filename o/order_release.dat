40|$|A key {{characteristic}} of MRP applications includes {{the coordination of}} assembly and purchased component requirements by time-phased <b>order</b> <b>releases.</b> In the literature on <b>order</b> review and <b>release</b> strategies, time- phased <b>order</b> <b>releases</b> are described as a worthy alternative to load limited release mechanisms. This paper initializes {{the development of a}} stochastic model that quantifies the consequences of time-phased <b>order</b> <b>releases</b> on the stochastic system behavior. This is done by introducing them in an open queueing network composed of two M/M/ 1 stations. The core of the analysis is focused on the modified flow variability which is specified by the second-order stationary departure process at the first station in the routing. It is a process characterized by a negligible autocorrelation. Based on the stationary-interval method and the asymptotic method, we propose an approximating renewal process for the modified departure process. The modelling efforts provide interesting conclusions and practical insights on some coordination issues in stochastic multi-echelon systems. ...|$|R

The matrix is designed to erode when it comes into contact with water but not until the desired point of release {{in order to avoid}} hydrolysis and the reduction of enzymatic activity.

This minimizes fluctuations while maximizing the amount of time the drug remains within the therapeutic window.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a shared-memory model, data-race-free- 1, that unifies four earlier models: weak <b>ordering,</b> <b>release</b> consistency (with sequentially consistent special operations), the VAX memory model, and datarace -free- 0. The most intuitive and commonly assumed shared-memory model, sequential consistency, limits performance. The models of weak <b>ordering,</b> <b>release</b> consistency, the VAX, and data-race-free- 0 {{are based on}} the common intuition that if programs synchronize explicitly and correctly, then sequential consistency can be guaranteed with high performance. However, each model formalizes this intuition differently and has different advantages and disadvantages with respect to the other models. Data-race-free- 1 unifies the models of weak <b>ordering,</b> <b>release</b> consistency, the VAX, and data-race-free- 0 by formalizing the above intuition in a manner that retains the advantages of each of the four models.

5000|$|Since {{surface erosion}} {{is easier to}} control than bulk erosion, surface erosion is {{preferred}} in drug delivery where {{the release of the}} drug must be constant or be controlled by changing the dimensions of the material. [...] A zero <b>order</b> <b>release</b> of a drug can be possible with surface erosion if a very thin material is used or if surface area is kept constant. Surface erosion is also useful for protecting water-soluble drugs until the time of desired drug release, because water will not penetrate through the polymer matrix and reach the drug until all the surrounding polymer has degraded. [...] However, bulk erosion can be useful in situations that do not require controlled release, such as plastic degradation.|$|E

Then when that fell through, they worked on a cover for [...] "The Perfect Kiss" [...] using one of Geoff's photographs, which can be seen later in New Order's songbook, 'X'. With time running out and Peter's decision not to run with this image - it didn't fit in Peter's subsequent portraits of the band on Low-Life - Geoff was offered an OMD album cover instead.

5000|$|In surface erosion, {{the erosion}} rate is {{directly}} proportional to the surface area of the material. For very thin materials, the surface area remains relatively constant when the material degrades, which allows surface erosion to be characterized as zero <b>order</b> <b>release</b> since the rate of degradation is constant. In bulk erosion, the erosion rate depends on {{the volume of the}} material. [...] Due to degradation, the volume of the material decreases during bulk erosion causing the erosion rate to decrease over time. Therefore, bulk erosion rates are difficult to control since it is not zero order. To determine whether a polymer will undergo surface or bulk erosion, the degradation rate of the polymer in water (how fast the polymer reacts to water) and the rate of diffusion of water penetrating through the material must be considered. If the degradation process is faster than the diffusion process, surface erosion will occur since the material’s surface will quickly degrade before water has time to diffuse and penetrate through the material. If the diffusion process is faster than the degradation process bulk erosion will occur because water penetrates through the material before significant erosion occurs on the surface. [...] A kinetics of the erosion of a polymer can be modified by changing the diffusion process or the degradation process. For example, blending a polymer with another polymer that is very reactive to water will speed up the degradation process and cause surface erosion. On the other hand, decreasing the dimensions of a material will allow water to travel {{to the center of the}} material more quickly, which speeds up the diffusion process and causes bulk erosion.|$|E
40|$|Workload {{control is}} a {{production}} planning and control concept specifically designed for complex manufacturing environments. Past research on Workload control has been essentially focused on discrete <b>order</b> <b>release.</b> This means that release of orders to the shop floor takes places on a periodic basis.

In particular, the paper aims at improving the basis for selecting the workload accounting over time and the workload control strategies, through the understanding of its impact on the overall system performance. The robustness of these <b>order</b> <b>release</b> strategies to environmental perturbations is also assessed through a plan of experiments based on the Taguchi method.
