5|$|Apart {{from the}} passing of noble titles or ranks, {{inheritance}} practices did not involve primogeniture; each son received an equal share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> property.

Daughters received a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> fortune through their marriage dowries, though this was usually {{much less than the}} shares of sons. A different distribution of the remainder could be specified in a will, but it is unclear how common this was.|$|E
