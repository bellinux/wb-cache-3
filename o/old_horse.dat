5|$|An {{agreement}} on simulcasting of harness and quarter horse races was reached in August allowing Rosecroft to reopen on August 25, 2011. Rosecroft owed $1.24 million in unpaid disbursements under its previous simulcast license, and the parties were negotiating {{about how much}} of this debt Penn National would pay. Rosecroft drew 400 to 500 patrons on its opening day. Penn National also announced its intent to spend $1 million in the coming year to renovate the property, which would include razing <b>old</b> <b>horse</b> barns, putting a new roof on the betting parlors, and upgrading the HVAC system.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{settlers in}} the Worlds End area rode on two horse trails to traverse the rugged mountains between Muncy Creek and the confluence of Little Loyalsock Creek with Loyalsock Creek at Forksville. These rugged and rocky trails were used steadily until 1895, when Pennsylvania Route154 was constructed to take their place. Part of these <b>old</b> <b>horse</b> trails are still in use and known as Pioneer Road and Double Run Road, and form part {{of two of the}} seven hiking trails in the park. Worlds End trail and Pioneer Road meet at the Worlds End Vista, which is thought to be a possible inspiration for the park's name.|$|E

25|$|The {{village has}} two public houses, which {{are close to}} the centre. These are the Eagle and Crown, built around 1840, and the Horse and Jockey. Built around 1850, the Horse and Jockey used to be {{situated}} opposite the Eagle and Crown and was owned by William Inman until 1875. The <b>old</b> <b>Horse</b> and Jockey building was demolished in the 1960s, before moving to new premises nearby. Meanwhile, the Overchurch Hotel and the Stirrup are situated away from the centre of the village.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the fire}} service role {{was taken over}} by the {{civilian}} station in 1938, it returned to the garrison at the start of World War II, when the officer in charge of the garrison also moved his headquarters to the same building. As a result, in 1940 the fire engines were upgraded to new Leyland Motors lorries. The <b>old</b> <b>horse</b> stables were hit by a Luftwaffe bomb on 16 August 1940, killing its civilian occupant, a Canadian officer, and two NCOs.|$|E

Wheatley came upon a mule being beaten on Forsyth Street while {{she was a member of}} the Fawcett Stock Company in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1907. The animal was being beaten by a man with a hickory stick. She implored him to stop. Wheatley gave him a half dollar and begged him to restrain his temper. When she left the mule's handler was coaxing him in a soothing manner, which pleased Wheatley. Previously she had intervened to prevent small children from rocking a dog and stopped a cab driver from abusing an <b>old</b> <b>horse.</b>|$|E
25|$|Major north-south streets {{crossing}} the City include Boundary Road, Willingdon Avenue, Royal Oak Avenue, Kensington Avenue, Sperling Avenue, Gaglardi Way, Cariboo Road, and North Road. East-west routes linking Burnaby's neighbouring cities {{to each other}} include Hastings Street, Barnet Highway, the Lougheed Highway, Kingsway (which follows the <b>old</b> <b>horse</b> trail between Vancouver and New Westminster), Canada Way and Marine Drive/Marine Way. Douglas Road, which used to cross the city from northwest to southeast, has largely been absorbed by the Trans-Canada Highway and Canada Way. Since the 1990s, Burnaby has developed a network of cycling trails. It is also well served by Metro Vancouver's bus system, run by the Coast Mountain Bus Company, a division of TransLink.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, a {{group of}} {{researchers}} announced that they had sequenced the DNA of a 560–780 thousand year <b>old</b> <b>horse,</b> using material extracted from a leg bone found buried in permafrost in Canada's Yukon territory. Prior to this publication, the oldest nuclear genome that had been successfully sequenced was dated at 110–130 thousand years ago. For comparison, the researchers also sequenced the genomes of a 43,000-year-old Pleistocene horse, a Przewalski's horse, five modern horse breeds, and a donkey. Analysis of differences between these genomes indicated that the last common ancestor of modern horses, donkeys, and zebras existed 4 to 4.5 million years ago. The results also indicated that Przewalski's horse diverged from other modern types of horse about 43,000 years ago, and had never in its evolutionary history been domesticated.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} {{other types of}} museums in the city. The Museo del Gaucho y de la Moneda, located in the Centro, has {{distinctive}} displays of the historical culture of Uruguay's gauchos, their horse gear, silver work and mate (tea), gourds, and bombillas (drinking straws) in odd designs. The Museo Naval, {{is located on the}} eastern waterfront in Buceo and offers exhibits depicting the maritime history of Uruguay. The Museo del Automóvil, belonging to the Automobile Club of Uruguay, has a rich collection of vintage cars which includes a 1910 Hupmobile. The Museo y Parque Fernando García in Carrasco, a transport and automobile museum, includes <b>old</b> <b>horse</b> carriages and some early automobiles. The Castillo Pittamiglio, with an unusual façade, highlights the eccentric legacy of Humberto Pittamiglio, local alchemist and architect.|$|E
25|$|A 2009 {{molecular}} {{study using}} ancient DNA recovered from archaeological finds places the Przewalski's {{horse in the}} middle of the domesticated horses, but 2011 mitochondrialDNA analysis suggests that the Przewalski and the modern domestic horse diverged some 160,000years ago. An analysis based on whole genome sequencing and calibration with DNA from <b>old</b> <b>horse</b> bones gave a divergence date of 38–72 thousand years ago. The karyotype of the domestic horse differs from that of Przewalski’s horse by an extra chromosome pair either because of the ﬁssion of domestic horse chromosome5 in Przewalski’s horse or fusion of Przewalski’s horse chromosomes 23 and 24 in the domestic horse. In comparison, the chromosomal differences between domestic horses and zebras include numerous translocations, fusions, and inversions. Przewalski’s horse is known to have the highest diploid chromosome number among all equine species. Przewalski’s horse can interbreed with the domestic horse and produce fertile offspring (65chromosomes).|$|E
25|$|Work {{started to}} convert the corporation's lines to {{electric}} power in 1898. The first to be done was from the Market Avenue to Prince Rock which was operated by electric trams from 22 January 1899. Electricity was supplied from the corporation's own power station at Cattewater (near {{the eastern end of}} the line) and a new tram depot was built in Elliot Road. The electrification was soon extended from Market Avenue to the Theatre. The first six electric cars were equipped to haul an <b>old</b> <b>horse</b> tram as a trailer, but this practice was discontinued after a derailment in Old Town Street. 4 April 1901 saw the route to Compton turned over to electric operation. A new electric route eastwards to Beaumont Road was opened on 2 April 1902. The horse trams to Peverell were replaced by electric on 13 January 1903, and those to Pennycomequick on 21 September 1905. This just left horse trams on the West Hoe route, which was converted on 22 June 1907.|$|E

Over 160 flights totaling more than 15 hours of flight time were conducted, {{and the results of}} this early test flight program were considered promising enough that a dozen examples of the type were ordered (serial numbers 56-6928 to 56-6939).

500|$|It {{was once}} a common {{practice}} to give horses a weekly bran mash of wheat bran mixed with warm water and other ingredients. [...] It is still done regularly in some places. [...] While a warm, soft meal is a treat many horses enjoy, and was once considered helpful for its laxative effect, it is not nutritionally necessary. [...] An <b>old</b> <b>horse</b> with poor teeth may benefit from food softened in water, a mash may help provide extra hydration, and a warm meal may be comforting in cold weather, but horses have far more fiber in their regular diet than do humans, and so any assistance from bran is unnecessary. There is also a risk that too much wheat bran may provide excessive phosphorus, unbalancing the diet, and a feed of unusual contents fed only once a week could trigger a bout of colic.|$|E
