50|$|On July 6, 2016, The European Parliament {{set into}} policy the Directive on Security of Network and Information Systems (the NIS Directive). The {{directive}} {{went into effect}} in August 2016 and all member states of the European parliament were given 21 months to incorporate the directive's regulations into their own national laws. The aim of the NIS Directive is to create an overall higher level of cyber security in the EU. This directive significantly affects digital service providers, DSPs, and <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>services,</b> OES. <b>Operators</b> <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> include any organizations whose operations would be greatly effected {{in the case of a}} security breach, provided that engage in critical societal or economic activities. Both DSPs and OES are now held accountable for reporting security incidents of a certain caliber to Computer Security Incident Response Teams, CSIRTs. While DSPs are not held to as stringent regulations as <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>services,</b> DSPs that are not set up in the EU but still operate in the EU still face regulations. Even when DSPs and OES outsource the maintenance of their information systems to third parties, the NIS Directive still holds them accountable for any security incidents.|$|R
30|$|In addition, the EU {{adopted the}} Cybersecurity Directive [64], {{which had to}} be {{implemented}} by the member states by 10 May 2018. This sets out a number of requirements for EU member states which aim to prevent cyberattacks and keep their consequences under control. Among other things, member states are required to ensure that <b>operators</b> <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> take appropriate measures to prevent and minimise the impact of incidents and to preserve service continuity (Articles 14 (2) and 16 (2)), and to ensure that supervisory authorities are notified of incidents without undue delay (Articles 14 (3) and 16 (3)) [64].|$|R

40|$|We {{examine how}} an Australian police union boasting over 99 per cent density has {{resisted}} {{the trend of}} decline. The union historically eschewed arbitration and instead used political connections to achieve goals.

The union reconfigured relationships with management and government but still made use of political action to secure instrumental gains. It has structures and practices that promote perceptions of responsiveness. The union's support base is built on the foundation of a well-administered legal defence fund.

40|$|Long-term {{volcanic}} activity at Soufrière Hills Volcano (SHV), Montserrat (1995 –ongoing) has created challenges for {{society and the}} resilience <b>of</b> the <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> (infrastructure) that support it. This paper explores the consequences, adaptations and resilience <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> through interviews with their staff. We find that quick fixes for <b>essential</b> <b>service</b> reinstatement {{in the north of}} Montserrat have prevailed. Yet, the legacy of this approach inhibits functionality through inadequate facilities and the perception of sites as temporary, stalling investment. Emigration resulted in staff shortages, retraining requirements and challenges for the viability of specialist services. Low-impact hazards exacerbate shortcomings in <b>essential</b> <b>services,</b> causing power cuts, corrosion, and temporary closures of schools, clinics and the airport. Adaptations developed over time include changes to roofing materials, the addition of back-up systems, collaborative working and the development of contingency plans. Resilience <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> has improved through decentralization, adaptations, and via strong community networks and tolerance of disruptions. Barriers to increasing resilience include the expense of some adaptations and the current reluctance to invest in <b>essential</b> <b>services,</b> hindering development. We offer some lessons for policy and practice to guide post-crisis redevelopment, through engagement with the community and by complementing community-level adaptations with investment to address long-term needs...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{growth and}} {{developed}} hospital should be effectively and efficiency managed. This fact should {{be carried out}} in order to face strict competitions in the health world. The hospital can survive in facing the existing competitions by counting the previous hospital fee and using fee account model competitively. In PKU Muhammadiyah Unit I Yogyakarta, Set <b>of</b> <b>Essential</b> <b>Services</b> (SES) <b>of</b> caesarea operation fee, class III, and cost sharing between the hospital and the goverment are different. In this study, the researcher only counts caesarea operation fee for re-use {{in order to create}} low cost sharing. Up till now, the hospital party never counts those existing differences. This case will lead them to get a financial loss. By having this fact, the researcher was eager to know about cost sharing analysis of caesarea operation fee account, class III, in PKU Muhammadiyah Unit I Yogyakarta. Methode: This was qualitative descriptive research which analyses the exact fee by using real cost method to know the difference of patient?s fee toward the real fee in the hospital. Bisides that, interview method was applied to know the head of finance and Central Surgeon Installation (CSI) workers opinion. Resulth: The result <b>of</b> Set <b>of</b> <b>Essential</b> <b>Services</b> (SES) fee <b>of</b> „health insurance? toward caesarea operation was Rp 1. 230. 429, caesarea operation fee by using real cost method was Rp 3. 764. 388, in fact, the exact fee from RS PKU Muhammadiyah Unit I Yogyakarta was Rp 4. 705. 388. In conclusion, the final results were the difference <b>of</b> ‘Set <b>of</b> <b>Essential</b> <b>Services</b> (SES) fee <b>of</b> ‘health insurance’ between real cost was Rp 2. 533. 959 and the difference <b>of</b> ‘Set <b>of</b> <b>Essential</b> <b>Services</b> (SES) fee <b>of</b> „health insurance? between the exact hospital costs was Rp 3. 475. 056. Conclusion: The researcher has concluded that set of costs which is based on unit cost was higher that hospital cost recently. The highest cost was given for buying medicines and temporary materials. The hospital party has to decide the best strategy to reduce those differences. Key words: cost sharing, real cost method, Set <b>of</b> <b>Essential</b> <b>Services</b> (SES) <b>of</b> caesarea operation fee, class III...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{critically}} {{explores the}} regulation of the insolvency <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> and the public interest through {{an examination of the}} common law and legislative responses in Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States. Drawing on understandings of the public interest gained from its analysis the thesis proposes a model of the public interest that may be used to justify representation of non-creditor interests within insolvency proceedings <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>services.</b> The model also identifies non-creditor public interest considerations that extend beyond continuity of supply. The thesis then undertakes case studies of {{the regulation of}} insolvency within the Australian electricity industry and Melbourne's public transport industry to examine how effectively public interest issues have been addressed and how these are balanced against the interests of the firm and its creditors. The thesis argues that a fundamental problem of the regulation <b>of</b> insolvent <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> is balancing the general public's interest in the fate of the insolvent firm with the interests of others stakeholders, particularly creditors. The thesis demonstrates {{there is a great deal}} of inconsistency of response to this issue both within and between the jurisdictions under consideration. Focussing on the public interest in the continuity of supply, the United Kingdom has enacted ad hoc insolvency procedures which are initiated by the state and oust creditor control mainly in relation to the monopoly sector <b>of</b> various <b>essential</b> <b>services.</b> A different approach in the United States has meant public interest considerations are built into its insolvency law through a combination of legislative prescription, judicial interpretation of the Bankruptcy Code and a limited willingness to grant non-creditor representation rights in insolvency proceedings <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>services.</b> The thesis argues that the integration model of the United States allows an appropriate balance to be struck between the interests of the firm and its creditors and the broader public interest when regulating the insolvency <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>services.</b> In contrast Australia has not enacted ad hoc insolvency procedures or expressly integrated the public interest within its insolvency law. The case study of the Australian electricity industry shows, however, that the public interest in the continuity of supply is managed by allowing creditors' rights to be affected radically by utilities regulation such a state step-in rights and retailer of last regulation. The thesis demonstrates the fragmented and inconsistent nature of these provisions. The case study of Melbourne's train and tram industry and the examination of South Australia's privatisation of its electricity assets by way of lease show the ways in which private contracting rather than utilities regulation can manage public interest issues. The thesis concludes that while the public's interest in the continuity <b>of</b> supply <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> in Australia is generally satisfactorily dealt with under current arrangements, what is less clear is whether public interest issues beyond continuity of supply will be given sufficient weight in insolvency proceedings, particularly in the context of a reorganising firm. The thesis argues it is within this area that there is space for integrating public interest considerations within Australia's insolvency law by expressly requiring the court to consider the public interest in such proceedings. Incorporating public interest considerations that recognise non-creditor stakeholder interests into Australian insolvency law requires theoretical justification. The thesis argues there are sound theoretical arguments for expanding insolvency's law role to accommodate broader stakeholder interests in the context of the insolvency <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> and that the model of the public interest proposed by the thesis may be used as a basis for a court to grant representation rights to non-creditor interests within insolvency proceedings <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>services</b> in Australia.

40|$|Magister Commercii - MComThree {{arguments}} are normally presented as {{rationale for the}} privatisation of state owned enterprises. The first relates {{to the problem of}} the financing of higher levels of public expenditure; the second is based on the viewpoint that private ownership is more efficient than public ownership; whilst the third claims that the losses of inefficient public enterprise are responsible for excessive budget deficits and other fiscal problems. Although empirical evidence proves that privatisation enhances economic efficiency, it negatively affects the affordability of and access to <b>essential</b> <b>services,</b> which may have serous consequences for poorer households. This happens through increased prices <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>services,</b> such as electricity and telecommunication, as well as through loss of employment opportunities during and after privatisation. Many countries, also in Africa, implemented various types of privatisation programmes {{over the past two decades}} in order to decrease the relative size of governments and to improve efficient delivery of services. Towards the end the 1990 ’s and after the tragic genocide, Rwanda’s Government of National Unity also embarked on an ambitious restructuring programme of its state-owned enterprises. The main purpose of this study was to assess the likely impact of privatisation on poor households in developing countries. The report presents a general overview of the literature, with a specific focus on Brazil, Argentina and South Africa. It investigates the experiences of these countries and derives lessons that can be learnt. Finally it assesses the possible impact of the privatisation <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>service</b> delivery on poor households in Rwanda. The main conclusion of the study is that governments should look beyond efficiency benefits of restructuring and focus on the overall opportunity cost of the privatisation <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>service</b> delivery. The specific method of privatisation may determine the final social impact. The case studies also highlight the need for more research into the challenges facing the privatisation <b>of</b> <b>essential</b> <b>service</b> delivery. It is clear that any restructuring should be preceded by a thorough analysis of the likely impact on the poorer sections of the community. South Afric...|$|R
