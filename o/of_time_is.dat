5|$|City at the End <b>of</b> <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> a 2008 {{science fiction}} novel by American writer Greg Bear. It was {{published}} in August 2008 by Del Rey in the United States, and Gollancz in the United Kingdom. The story follows three drifters in present-day Seattle who are tormented by strange dreams of the Kalpa, a city one hundred trillion years in the future. The Kalpa is attempting {{to ward off the}} Typhon, an inexplicable entity that has consumed the rest of the ancient universe and broken down the laws of physics.|$|E

5|$|Despite its slow {{metabolism}} rate, the Sunda slow loris has a high-energy diet. Its slow lifestyle {{may be due}} to {{the energy}} costs of detoxifying certain secondary plant compounds in many genera of food plants their diets. The largest amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> spent eating phloem sap (34.9%), floral nectar and nectar-producing plant parts (31.7%), and fruits (22.5%). It also consumes gums and arthropods such as spiders and insects. Gum is taken by licking wounds on trees. They are also known to feed on molluscs, including the giant land snail Achatina fulica, and birds' eggs.|$|E
5|$|The lyrics' {{reference}} {{to an extreme}} length <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> accentuated by the stretching out of an already slow 6/8 metre into 9/8, and, during the verses, by the appending of a measure-long instrumental tag after each two bars of vocal melody. Partly {{as a result of}} the absence of resolution in the home key, the descending bassline in the verses – a 4-3-2-1 sequence of notes mirroring the IV-iii-ii-I chord pattern – establishes an almost subliminal tonic.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, alien time {{traveller}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) {{attempts to}} escape his apparent {{death at the}} hands of the Silence. River Song (Alex Kingston), whom the Silence had programmed to kill the Doctor, refuses, and they end up in an alternative timeline where all <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> running simultaneously and beginning to disintegrate. The Doctor tries to restore the universe with the help of River and the alternative universe versions of his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill). It is revealed that he had already planned escape by posing as himself using the shape-shifting Teselecta.|$|E

The fixed effects <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>were</b> also estimated with Wald-tests.|$|R
5|$|Miyamoto {{initially}} intended Ocarina of Time to {{be played}} in a first-person perspective to enable players {{to take in the}} vast terrain of Hyrule Field better, as well as to be able to focus more on developing enemies and environments. This concept was overridden once {{the idea of having a}} child Link was introduced, and Miyamoto believed it necessary for Link to be visible on screen. Ocarina of Time originally ran on the same engine as Super Mario 64, but was so heavily modified that designer Shigeru Miyamoto considers the final products entirely different engines. One major difference between the two is camera control; the player has a lot of control over the camera in Super Mario 64, but the camera in Ocarina <b>of</b> <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> largely controlled by the game's AI. Miyamoto says the camera controls for Ocarina of Time are intended to reflect a focus on the game's world, whereas those of Super Mario 64 are centered on the character of Mario.|$|E
5|$|Prince of Persia: The Sands <b>of</b> <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> an action-adventure puzzle-platformer. The player {{controls}} the main protagonist, an unnamed Prince from a kingdom in Persia. Environments are seen through a controllable third-person view. The camera's view changes to different positions triggered by entering certain areas or performing actions. The Prince {{can be moved}} in all directions, and {{he is able to}} manipulate large objects such as blocks and levers connected to mechanisms. His health and power metre are represented in the top left-hand corner of the screen. The Prince restores health by drinking water from pools and fountains. Collecting Sands increases the Prince's power, and drinking from hidden magic fountains increases the Prince's maximum health. During several points in the game, the Prince is assisted by his companion Farah, who fires a bow at enemies, though her arrows can also hit the Prince if he strays into her line of fire. Monsters will attack her, and if she is killed, the game ends.|$|E
5|$|Taft is now better {{remembered for}} his books, such as The History of American Sculpture (1903), {{regarded}} as the first comprehensive work on the subject. However, in his day he was well known for portraits and allegorical public sculpture, of which Fountain <b>of</b> <b>Time</b> <b>is</b> a prime example. It was produced in the period following his assignment to design sculptures for William Le Baron Jenney's 1893 Horticultural Building for the World's Columbian Exposition. During this period he designed several large-scale public works, including Fountain of the Great Lakes. Taft resided in Illinois {{for most of his}} life and worked in the Midway Studios starting in 1906.|$|E

5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows the progress <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> also without precedent in Western art. The {{death of a}} blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed {{on the ground in the}} lower left portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.|$|E
5|$|When {{the great}} bell rings out every full hour, {{struck by a}} large clockwork-operated hammer, passers-by see a gilded figure in full harness moving its arm to strike it. The larger-than-life figure of bearded Chronos, the Greek {{personification}} <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> <b>is</b> traditionally nicknamed Hans von Thann by the Bernese. The wooden bell-striker, which has been replaced several times, has been a fixture of the Zytglogge since the renewal of the astronomical clock in 1530, whose clockwork also controls the figure's motions. The original wooden Chronos might have been created by master craftsman Albrecht von Nürnberg, while the current and most recent Hans is a 1930 reconstruction of a Baroque original. The bell-striker has been gilded, just like the bells, since 1770.|$|E
25|$|The B-theory <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> {{the name}} given {{to one of}} two {{positions}} regarding philosophy of time. B-theorists argue that the flow <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> an illusion, that the past, present and future are equally real, and that time is tenseless. This would mean that temporal becoming is not an objective feature of reality.|$|E

25|$|Chronoception {{refers to}} how the passage <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> {{perceived}} and experienced. Although the sense <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> not associated with a specific sensory system, the work of psychologists and neuroscientists indicates that human brains do have a system governing the perception of time, composed of a highly distributed system involving the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia. One particular component, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, {{is responsible for the}} circadian (or daily) rhythm, while other cell clusters appear to be capable of shorter-range (ultradian) timekeeping.|$|E
