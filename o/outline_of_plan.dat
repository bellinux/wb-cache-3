There a thousand of them sit, under proper officers, proper wages, treatment;--and the hum of their poor spindles, and of their poor inarticulate old hearts, is a comfort, if one chance to think of it.--Of [...] "distressed needlewomen" [...] who cannot sew, nor be taught to do it; who, in private truth, are mutinous maid-servants come at last to the net upshot of their anarchies; of these, or of the like incurable phenomena, I hear nothing in Berlin; and can believe that, under this King, Indigence itself may still have something of a human aspect, not a brutal or diabolic as is commoner in some places.--This is one of Friedrich's first acts, this opening of the Corn-magazines, and arrangements for the Destitute; [Helden-Geschichte, i. 367.

40|$|This {{panel will}} present the process and {{significance}} of conducting research with immigrants using Occupational Science perspectives. While a number of disciplines have studied immigrants’ adaptation process, the use of occupational science perspectives in understanding the various aspects of daily life impacted by immigration {{is still in its}} infancy. There are few studies that give insight into the particular methodological, practical, and ethical challenges encountered when studying immigrants’ experiences. Given the increasing number of immigrants and refugees across the globe, it is essential that their context and experience be better understood through research processes that can respectfully capture the nuances of individual and shared experience, often within contexts in which participants feel unsafe and vulnerable. Panelist will discuss the methodological complexities and significance of research studies they have conducted with this population. <b>Outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>Plan</b> for the Session: As panelists who have been conducting research with immigrants for the past few years, each of us will use examples from our studies to illustrate the value of viewing the immigrants as “occupational beings” when trying to understand the impact of this major life transition on their everyday lives, health and well-being, and focusing on the rewards and challenges of the research process. We also will present our vision for the significance of such research not only for health professionals involved in the care of immigrants but also for other players at the system’s level...|$|E
40|$|Like {{occupational}} science, complexity {{science is}} a new and emerging academic discipline which has emphasized interdisciplinary cooperation. A variety of theories have been developed within complexity science to help understand the behavior of complex, nonlinear systems. The roots of complexity science {{can be traced to}} general systems theory, and its scope has grown to include dynamic systems theory, chaos theory, and complex adaptive systems theory. Historically, occupation has been analyzed and occupational models have been developed around linear models, including general systems theory. In recent years, however, there has been a call to begin exploring the application of nonlinear models to the analysis of occupation. Contemporary applications of complexity theory in occupational science have typically involved understanding the individual as a complex system. This panel presentation will expand upon recent work within occupational science, by exploring three different and interacting levels of analysis through the lens of complexity science. At the first level, the individual is viewed as a complex system, and occupation is seen as an emergent phenomenon of the system. At the second level, the individual is viewed as an agent interacting with others in the co-production of occupation. Finally, at the third level, the occupations emerging from either or both of the first two levels can be viewed as forming a system which can be analyzed through concepts from complexity science. Understanding and distinguishing between these levels of analysis is important for occupational scientists for at least three reasons. First, it may provide a theoretical space for integrating disparate conceptions of occupation. Second, it prompts questions regarding the interaction and mutual influence between these different levels. And finally, it suggests new areas for occupational science research. <b>Outline</b> <b>of</b> <b>Plan</b> for the Session: A. Introduction to complexity theory What are complex systems? Review non- linearity, sensitivity to original conditions, emergent properties, self-organization, and self reinforcement.

History of relationship between occupational science/therapy and non-linear systems theories. C.
