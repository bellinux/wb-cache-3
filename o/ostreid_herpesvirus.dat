40|$|Since its {{molecular}} characterisation, <b>Ostreid</b> <b>herpesvirus</b> 1 (OsHV- 1) {{has been}} regularly detected in Crassostrea gigas in France. Although its pathogenicity was demonstrated on larval stages, its involvement during mortality outbreaks at the juvenile stage was highly suspected but not evidenced. To investigate mortality outbreaks, the French National Network for Surveillance and Monitoring of Mollusc Health (REPAMO) carried out two surveys in juvenile C. gigas. The first survey lasted from 1998 to 2006 {{and was an}} epidemiological inquiry occurring when oyster farmers reported mortality outbreaks. The second survey, a longitudinal one, {{was set up in}} 1998 to complete the network observations on OsHV- 1. Data analysis showed a specific pattern of mortality outbreaks associated with OsHV- 1 detection. <b>Ostreid</b> <b>herpesvirus</b> 1 detection mainly appeared during the summer, suggesting the influence of the seawater temperature on its occurrence. It mostly presented a patchy distribution in the field in contrast to the nursery. Significant relationship between OsHV- 1 detection and spat mortality was found, preferentially in sheltered and closed environments. The longitudinal survey confirmed most of the network observations. Although subsequent works particularly epidemiological surveys would be useful to confirm the causal link between the detection of OsHV- 1 and the mortality outbreaks in juvenile C. gigas, the role of OsHV- 1 in oyster mortality is progressing...|$|E

40|$|Mortality episodes have {{regularly}} been {{affecting the}} shellfish industry throughout its history. Some of these mortalities, {{especially in the}} oyster industry, {{have been attributed to}} herpesviruses. Purification of viral particles and molecular characterization have {{led to the development of}} routine monitoring, as well as improved taxonomic classification. Ostreid herpesviruses (Malacoherpesviridae), mostly affecting Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas, have been sporadically recorded in the French oyster industry since the early 1990 s (OsHV- 1 ‘reference’). From 2008, a new variant of <b>ostreid</b> <b>herpesvirus</b> (OsHV- 1 µVar) has emerged and seriously impacted oyster production in France and other European countries. Consequently, the presence of ostreid herpesviruses has been monitored in different oyster producing areas around the world. The present study compiles molecular data that are available from survey efforts and takes a biogeographical approach, in order to infer an origin for ostreid herpesviruses. The highest genotype diversity was found in East Asia, despite a lower survey effort in that area than in Europe. Genotype network analyses show that both populations of ostreid herpesviruses present in Europe (OsHV- 1 ‘reference’ and OsHV- 1 µVar) are closely related to genotypes recorded in Asia. Moreover, ostreid herpesviruses have been detected in wild and symptom-free populations of various Asian native Crassostrea species. In the rest of the world, <b>ostreid</b> <b>herpesvirus</b> genotypes were recorded from cultivated C. gigas, and mostly associated with mortality episodes. Results of this study are therefore highly suggestive of an Asian origin for these viruses, which can be pathogenic under farming conditions. It also highlights the risks of European stock improvements, by means of overseas shellfish imports...|$|E

Here we describe the interactions between these 2 pathogens and autophagy, a conserved intracellular pathway playing a key role in innate immunity.

Animals were sampled for proteomic analysis two days post-injection, {{at the same time as}} OsHV- 1 initiated an intense replication phase in challenged oysters. Twenty-five abundant protein spots that showed a marked change in accumulated levels were identified using a two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) proteomic approach. Overall, these proteins are involved in cytoskeleton organization, protein turnover, induction of stress signals, signalling pathways and energy metabolism. Challenged oysters exhibited an increased glycolysis and VDAC accumulation, which reflect a “Warburg effect” as initially reported in cancer cells and more recently in shrimp infected with virus. The results presented here should be useful for identifying potential biomarkers of disease resistance and developing antiviral measures. Biological significance This study is the first 2 -DE proteomic analysis dedicated to the pathogenesis of <b>ostreid</b> <b>herpesvirus</b> 1 (OsHV- 1 μVar) in oyster Crassostrea gigas, the most important bivalve produced in the world. OsHV- 1 has affected oysters every year since 2008. All the proteins identified in this paper are key targets involved in OsHV- 1 infection processes. We presented evidence that the metabolic changes during infection in oyster somehow resemble the Warburg effect occurring in cancer cells. This work constitutes a real advance in the comprehension of the host metabolic pathways affected during OsHV- 1 disease. Overall, this work contributes to a better understanding of disease mortalities in aquatic ecosystems which could guide management actions to mitigate their impacts...|$|E

In this paper, we explore the case for an integrated approach to study the management of bivalve disease, using OsHV- 1 as a case study.

We found that disease mortality of oysters showed strong spatial dependence clearly reflecting the epizootic process of local transmission. Disease initiated inside oyster farms spread rapidly beyond these areas. Local differences in energetic condition of oysters, partly driven by variation in food quality, played a significant role in the spatial and temporal dynamics of disease mortality. In particular, the relative contribution of diatoms to the diet of oysters was positively correlated with their energetic reserves, which in turn decreased the risk of disease mortality...|$|E

This study compares OsHV- 1 DNA and RNA detection and localization in experimentally infected oysters using two virus doses: a low dose that did not induce any mortality and a high dose inducing high mortality. Real time PCR demonstrated significant differences in terms of viral DNA amounts between the two virus doses. RNA transcripts were detected in oysters receiving the highest dose of viral suspension whereas no transcript was observed in oysters injected with the low dose. This study also allowed observing kinetics of viral DNA and RNA detection in different tissues of oyster spat.

40|$|Since 2008, mass {{mortality}} {{events of}} Crassostrea gigas have been occurring along the French coast when seawater temperature exceeds 16 ºC.

In the laboratory, both exposed (infected) and naïve (healthy) oysters were maintained at 13. 0 °C and 20. 6 ºC. These temperatures were respectively lower and higher than the threshold values of 16 °C at which the disease generally occur. At 20. 6 ºC, exposed oysters were characterized by a reduction in energetic reserves (carbohydrates and triglycerides) together with a decrease in protein content. Sterols levels were lower in exposed oysters than in naïve individuals, irrespective of temperature. Finally, activities of some key enzymes related to energetics were similar in exposed and naïve oysters and did not change with temperature.

40|$|Mass {{mortality}} {{outbreaks of}} Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, {{are reported in}} different areas around the world affecting seriously the shellfish aquaculture sector. Two pathogens are associated with these mortality outbreaks, <b>ostreid</b> <b>herpesvirus</b> 1 (OsHV- 1) and Vibrio aestuarianus. In this contexte, a better knowledge is needed in terms of oyster immunity. For this purpose, as an important degradation pathway autophagy was investigated in the Pacific oysters. An in silico research of genes involved in autophagy using the C. gigas genome allowed identification of homologs of ATG 1 and ATG 8 /LC 3 (Microtubule-associated protein 1 A/ 1 B-light chain 3). Gene expression and protein detection were analysed using real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. ATG 1 and ATG 8 gene expression was upregulated during an experimental viral infection. Western blot analysis showed an increase of LC 3 protein during the infection, suggesting an activation of autophagy. Ammonium chloride treatment was associated with increased oyster mortality whereas less mortality was reported after carbamazepine treatment in experimentally infected animals. Results suggest a protective role of autophagy against OsHV- 1 and V. aestuarianus infection. This study contributes {{to better understand the}} innate immune system of Pacific oysters...|$|E

Sibling diploids and triploids were produced using either unselected or selected OsHV- 1 -resistant oysters. No significant interactions {{were found between the}} factors of environment, genotype and ploidy at the endpoint dates. The mean mortality rates at the sites were 62 and 59 % for diploids and triploids, respectively, and the two rates were not significantly different. The mean mortality rates were 33 and 32 % for sibling diploids and triploids, respectively, when OsHV- 1 -resistant parents were used, and 91 and 85 %, respectively, when unselected parents were used. The results were confirmed through other broodstocks tested in 2013. Our study is the first to clearly show that mortality related to OsHV- 1 is similar between diploids and triploids in C. gigas when the same germplasm is used for both ploidy. Furthermore, OsHV- 1 resistance was not substantially altered by triploidization, indicating that the achieved selective breeding of diploid oysters for OsHV- 1 resistance can be translated into improved survival in triploids...|$|E

Mortality was monitored in healthy oyster spat deployed at 106 locations in the Thau Mediterranean lagoon during the epizootic that occurred in spring 2011. We conducted a field survey of farming practices in the areas where the sentinel oysters were placed before the epizootic. We found {{that the risk of}} disease mortality in sentinel oysters was higher within the bivalve farming area than outside it, suggesting that the infection pressure is much higher in areas with intensive farming activity. The risk of mortality was higher in farms rearing spat, a developmental stage particularly susceptible to OsHV- 1, than in farms rearing adult oysters, which are generally more resistant. Additionally, the mortality risk in farms rearing adult animals was similar to that in empty farms, which suggests that, during the study period, adult oysters did not vector the disease. Interestingly, the mortality risk for sentinel oysters deployed in mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis farms was lower than for those held in oyster farms or empty farms, suggesting that mussels reduced the infection pressure on susceptible oysters...|$|E

Since the mid- 1990 s, the invasive Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas (Thunberg 1793) population in the area has grown exponentially, having a distinct impact on the ecosystem. The recent spread of the emerging oyster pathogen <b>Ostreid</b> <b>herpesvirus</b> OsHV- 1 μVar worldwide and specifically in the oyster culture areas {{in the south of}} the Netherlands raised the question whether the virus may also be present in the Wadden Sea. In the summer of 2012 juvenile Pacific oysters were collected from five locations in the Dutch Wadden Sea. The virus was shown to be present in three of the five locations by real-time PCR and sequencing. It was concluded that OsHV- 1 μVar has settled itself in Pacific oyster reefs in the Wadden Sea. These results and the recent discoveries of OsHV- 1 microvariants in Australia and Korea indicate that OsHV- 1 μVar and related variants might be more widespread than can be deduced from current literature.

40|$|The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is farmed globally. <b>Ostreid</b> <b>herpesvirus</b> (OsHV- 1) causes severe mortalities of farmed C. gigas. Management of OsHV- 1 {{has proven}} difficult. Oysters treated with poly(I:C) exhibit {{enhanced}} protection (EP) against OsHV- 1. This chemical treatment is highly effective, {{but it is}} not feasible to treat every oyster on a farm. To circumvent this practical limitation, previous studies on arthropods have suggested that EP can be transferred from parents to their offspring (trans-generational EP, TGEP). This suggests that the treatment of relatively few parents could be used to produce large numbers of offspring with TGEP. Here, we investigated TGEP in oysters to test whether it might be used as a cost effective management tool to control OsHV- 1. We found that offspring (D-veliger larvae) produced from poly(I:C) -treated parents had double the chance of surviving exposure to OsHV- 1 compared to controls. Furthermore, the larvae of poly(I:C) -treated parents contained elevated levels of mRNA encoding a key transcription factor that regulates antiviral immunity (IRF 2). Poly(I:C) treatment had no effect on the survival of oyster parents. Hence, the enhanced immunity of their offspring could not be explained by genetic selection, and instead may reflect epigenetic reprogramming or maternal provisioning. 8 page(s...|$|E

To assess the genetic basis of resistance to OsHV- 1 infection in spat C. gigas and to facilitate breeding programs for such a trait, if any exist, we compared the mortality of half- and full-sib families using three field methods and a con-trolled challenge by OsHV- 1 in the laboratory. In the field, three methods were tested: (A) one family per bag; (B) one family per small soft mesh bag and all families inside one bag; (C) same as the previous methods but the oysters were individually labelled and then mixed. The mean mortality ranged from 80 to 82 % and was related to OsHV- 1 based on viral DNA detection. The narrow-sense heritability for mortality, and thus OsHV- 1 resis-tance, ranged from 0. 49 to 0. 60.

However, few studies have been performed to understand and follow viral gene expression, as it has been done in vertebrate herpesviruses. In this work, experimental infection trials of C. gigas spat with OsHV- 1 were conducted in order to test the susceptibility of several bi-parental oyster families to this virus and to analyze host-pathogen interactions using in vivo transcriptomic approaches. Results: The divergent response of these oyster families in terms of mortality confirmed that susceptibility to OsHV- 1 infection has a significant genetic component. Two families with contrasted survival rates were selected. A total of 39 viral genes and five host genes were monitored by real-time PCR. Initial results provided information on (i) the virus cycle of OsHV- 1 based on the kinetics of viral DNA replication and transcription and (ii) host defense mechanisms against the virus. Conclusions: In the two selected families, the detected amounts of viral DNA and RNA were significantly different. This result suggests that Pacific oysters are genetically diverse in terms of their susceptibility to OsHV- 1 infection.

Determining how host ontogeny interacts with water temperature to influence the antiviral response of the Pacific oysters, Crassostrea gigas, is a major goal in understanding why juvenile Pacific oysters are dying during summer {{as a result of the}} global emergence of a new genotype of the <b>Ostreid</b> <b>herpesvirus,</b> termed OsHV- 1 μvar. We measured the effect of temperature (12 vs 22 °C) on the antiviral response of adult and juvenile C. gigas injected with poly I:C. Poly I:C up-regulated the expression of numerous immune genes, including TLR, MyD 88, IκB- 1, Rel, IRF, MDA 5, STING, SOC, PKR, Viperin and Mpeg 1. At 22 °C, these immune genes showed significant up-regulation in juvenile and adult oysters, but the majority of these genes were up-regulated 12 h post-injection for juveniles compared to 26 h for adults. At 12 °C, the response of these genes was completely inhibited in juveniles and delayed in adults. Temperature and age had no effect on hemolymph antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus (HSV- 1). These results suggest that oysters rely on a cellular response to minimise viral replication, involving recognition of virus-associated molecular patterns to induce host cells into an antiviral state, as opposed to producing broad-spectrum antiviral compounds. This cellular response, measured by antiviral gene expression of circulating hemocytes, was influenced by temperature and oyster age. We speculate whether the vigorous antiviral response of juveniles at 22 °C results in an immune-mediated disorder causing mortalit...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDouble-stranded RNA (dsRNA) -mediated genetic {{interference}} (RNAi) is {{a widely}} used reverse genetic tool for determining the loss-of-function phenotype of a gene. Here, the possible induction of an immune response by long dsRNA was tested in a marine bivalve (Crassostrea gigas), {{as well as the}} specific role of the subunit 2 of the nuclear factor κB inhibitor (IκB 2). This gene is a candidate of particular interest for functional investigations in the context of oyster mass mortality events, as Cg-IκB 2 mRNA levels exhibited significant variation depending on the amount of <b>ostreid</b> <b>herpesvirus</b> 1 (OsHV- 1) DNA detected. In the present study, dsRNAs targeting Cg-IκB 2 and green fluorescent protein genes were injected in vivo into oysters before being challenged by OsHV- 1. Survival appeared close to 100 % in both dsRNA-injected conditions associated with a low detection of viral DNA and a low expression of a panel of 39 OsHV- 1 genes as compared with infected control. Long dsRNA molecules, both Cg-IκB 2 -and GFP-dsRNA, may have induced an anti-viral state controlling the OsHV- 1 replication and precluding the understanding of the specific role of Cg-IκB 2. Immune-related genes including Cg-IκB 1, Cg-Rel 1, Cg-IFI 44, Cg-PKR and Cg-IAP appeared activated in the dsRNA-injected condition, potentially hampering viral replication and thus conferring a better resistance to OsHV- 1 infection. We revealed that long dsRNA-mediated genetic interference triggered an anti-viral state in the oyster, emphasizing the need for new reverse genetics tools for assessing immune gene function and avoiding off-target effects in bivalves...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ostreid</b> <b>herpesvirus</b> 1 (OsHV- 1) is {{the only}} member of the Herpesviridae that has an {{invertebrate}} host and is associated with sporadic mortality in the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) and other bivalve species. Cryo-electron microscopy of purified capsids revealed the distinctive T= 16 icosahedral structure characteristic of herpesviruses, although the preparations examined lacked pentons. The gross genome organization of OsHV- 1 was similar to that of certain mammalian herpesviruses (including herpes simplex virus and human cytomegalovirus), consisting of two invertible unique regions (UL, 167 · 8  kbp; US, 3 · 4  kbp) each flanked by inverted repeats (TRL/IRL, 7 · 6  kbp; TRS/IRS, 9 · 8  kbp), with an additional unique sequence (X, 1 · 5  kbp) between IRL and IRS. Of the 124 unique genes predicted from the 207   439  bp genome sequence, 38 were members of 12 families of related genes and encoded products related to helicases, inhibitors of apoptosis, deoxyuridine triphosphatase and RING-finger proteins, in addition to membrane-associated proteins. Eight genes in three of the families appeared to be fragmented. Other genes that did not belong to the families were predicted to encode DNA polymerase, the two subunits of ribonucleotide reductase, a helicase, a primase, the ATPase subunit of terminase, a RecB-like protein, additional RING-like proteins, an ion channel and several other membrane-associated proteins. Sequence comparisons showed that OsHV- 1 is at best tenuously related to the two classes of vertebrate herpesviruses (those associated with mammals, birds and reptiles, and those associated with bony fish and amphibians). OsHV- 1 thus represents a third major class of the herpesviruses...|$|E
40|$|Generalised {{reviews of}} RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) in invertebrates, and {{for use in}} aquaculture, have taken for granted that RNAi pathways operate in molluscs, but inspection of such reviews show little specific evidence of such activity in molluscs. This review was to understand what specific research had been conducted on RNAi in molluscs, {{particularly with regard to}} aquaculture. There were questions of whether RNAi in molluscs functions similarly to the paradigm established for most eukaryotes or, alternatively, was it more similar to the ecdozoa and how RNAi may relate to disease control in aquaculture? RNAi in molluscs appears to have been only investigated in about 14 species, mostly as a gene silencing phenomenon. We can infer that microRNAs including let- 7 are functional in molluscs. The genes/proteins involved in the actual RNAi pathways have only been rudimentarily investigated, so how homologous the genes and proteins are to other metazoa is unknown. Furthermore, how many different genes for each activity in the RNAi pathway are also unknown? The cephalopods have been greatly overlooked with only a single RNAi gene-silencing study found. The long dsRNA-linked interferon pathways seem to be present in molluscs, unlike some other invertebrates and could be used to reduce disease states in aquaculture. In particular, interferon regulatory factor genes have been found in molluscs of aquacultural importance such as Crassostrea, Mytilus, Pinctada and Haliotis. Two possible aquaculture scenarios are discussed, zoonotic norovirus and <b>ostreid</b> <b>herpesvirus</b> 1 to illustrate the possibilities. The entire field of RNAi in molluscs looks ripe for scientific exploitation and practical application...|$|E
