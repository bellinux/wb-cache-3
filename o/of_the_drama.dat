5|$|Earlier in 2017 Puw {{completed}} his first chamber opera Y Tŵr {{based on the}} play by the Welsh playwright, Gwenlyn Parry and to libretto by Gwyneth Glyn. The opera in three acts explores the relationship and emotions between two characters during three specific periods in their lives, during youth, middle age and finally, old age. The composer's use of atonal musical language, octatonic scales and the occasional tonal passage are directly linked with the various emotions of the characters and the unfolding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drama.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1871, {{producer}} John Hollingshead brought Gilbert and Sullivan {{together to}} produce a Christmas entertainment, Thespis, at his Gaiety Theatre, a large West End house. The piece was an extravaganza in which the classical Greek gods, grown elderly, are temporarily replaced by a troupe of 19th-century actors and actresses, {{one of whom is}} the eponymous Thespis, the Greek father <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drama.</b> Its mixture of political satire and grand opera parody mimicked Offenbach's Orpheus in the Underworld and La belle Hélène, which (in translation) then dominated the English musical stage.|$|E

5|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics; many felt {{that while the}} episode had an interesting theme and that much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> was successful, the humor was too broad or forced. The episode was viewed by 3.44 million viewers and received a 1.8/5 percent rating among adults {{between the ages of}} 18 and 49. The episode ranked fourth in its timeslot, and it was the highest-rated NBC series of the night, though it was lowest rated episode of The Office at the time of airing.|$|E

5|$|A free buffet for {{servicemen}} {{was provided}} {{at the station}} during both World Wars. The Preston Station Free Buffet Association served free hot drinks, biscuits and buns and sold sandwiches at cost price to anyone in uniform 24 {{hours a day for}} the duration of the First World War. Four hundred women working 12-hour shifts served over 3million men between 1915 and 1919. 12million cups of tea were served between 1939 and 1945. It was funded by subscription and had its own marked crockery. The station was on a major north-south route for troops. There are three commemorative plaques related to the First World War buffet in the waiting room on platforms 3 and 4, the former site of WWI buffet. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> segments of the televised Preston Passion of 2012 was set in the First World War servicemen's buffet.

5|$|As a manifesto, this {{paragraph}} became {{significant for the}} amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra to express the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> in instrumental music and set expository and narrative sections in words. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in Roméo, Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide {{the structure of a}} choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony. In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler owe a debt of influence to Berlioz.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{continued}} to freelance, submitting humor columns {{to a variety}} of publications, including Life (where fellow humorist James Thurber stated that Benchley's columns were the only reason the magazine was read). He continued meeting with his friends at the Algonquin, and the group became popularly known as the Algonquin Round Table. In April 1920, Benchley landed a position with Life writing theatre reviews, which he would continue doing regularly through 1929, eventually taking complete control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> section. His reviews were known for their flair, and he often used them as a soapbox for issues of concern to him, whether petty (people who cough during plays) or more important (such as racial intolerance).|$|E

5|$|By early July, Butler had {{realized}} {{the futility of}} his race, and took to ignoring Tillman in his speeches, which the governor reciprocated, taking much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> from the debates. The two men even rode in the same carriage on July 4. Nevertheless, Butler refused to surrender, even after the primary for the legislature was overwhelmingly won by the Tillmanites, threatening action in the courts and an election contest before the Senate. On December 11, 1894, Benjamin Tillman {{was elected to the}} Senate by the new legislature with 131 votes. Butler received 21 and three votes were scattered.|$|E
5|$|Growing up, Takako Matsu practiced {{piano and}} took vocal {{training}} as a child. Prior to releasing music, she acted in various television drama and plays. In 1996, she acted in the drama Long Vacation, which became very popular in Japan. At the wrap up party <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drama,</b> {{the director of the}} series at that time heard her perform karaoke and suggested that she try singing. Although taken aback and hesitant at first, she later agreed, as she felt it was not a chance that everyone received and because she liked singing; she felt it might work out somehow.|$|E
5|$|Having {{established}} {{herself as}} a film actress in the meantime, she made her Broadway debut in 1953, appearing in Robert Anderson's Tea and Sympathy, for which she received a Tony Award nomination. Kerr repeated her role along with her stage partner John Kerr (no relation) in Vincente Minnelli's film adaptation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drama.</b> In 1955, Kerr won the Sarah Siddons Award for her performance in Chicago during a national tour of the play. After her Broadway début in 1953, she toured the United States with Tea and Sympathy.

5|$|However, Shakespeare {{soon began}} to adapt the {{traditional}} styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III {{has its roots in}} the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps the best example of the mixing of the styles. By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> itself.|$|E
5|$|Norio Tsukudani based Himegoto on {{an earlier}} four-panel manga she drew for fun during her time as a student. At that time, the main {{characters}} {{that make up the}} student council were instead members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> club. However, Tsukudani decided to change this when developing Himegoto to be serialized in Ichijinsha's Waai! magazine, and she decided {{it would be easier to}} manage a cross-dressing character if he was in the student council. Before creating Himegoto, Tsukudani read various works of fiction that featured cross-dressing boys, but many of them featured the boys being paired with other boys. When she proposed the idea of Himegoto, she wanted to pair a cross-dressing boy with girls, which Tsukudani herself wanted to read. In this way, she thought that a variety of different people would enjoy it.|$|E
5|$|Patton {{was born}} in Fallsburg, Kentucky on May 26, 1937, in a {{retrofitted}} silo with no indoor plumbing, electricity, or telephone. He was the only son of the three children born to Ward and Irene Patton. The family moved often because Ward Patton, a teacher, was assigned to a different school every year. When {{he was hired by}} a railroad in Pike County, he and his wife agreed that she would remain in Fallsburg with the children until they finished school. Patton attended Fallsburg Elementary School, a four-room schoolhouse in his hometown. He was active in the 4-H club, where he began to develop his public speaking ability. In 1951, he enrolled at Louisa High School in Louisa, Kentucky. He was an honor student, a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> club, a football and baseball player, and class president during his senior year. In 1955, he graduated with the third-highest grade point average in his class of 73.|$|E

5|$|Politically, the {{treatise}} was a success. At {{the time}} of writing On the Art of the Cinema, Kim's father Kim Il-sung was systematically rallying support for the younger Kim to prepare for his succession. By authoring the work, Kim Jong-il gained social and political power. He secured his father's confidence, thus making succession possible. Kim Jong-il continued to write on the arts until the 1990s and published treatises On the Art of Opera (1974), On the Art <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Drama</b> (1988), On the Art of Dance (1990), On the Art of Music (1991), On Fine Art (1991), On Architecture (1991), On Juche Literature (1992), and On Acrobatics.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2003, {{the tournament}} format was a Limit Hold'em tournament, but in 2004, No-Limit Hold'em became the standard. The 2006 tournament, with 1,232 entrants, {{was the largest}} field ever for the event. Since its inception, with the {{exception}} of 2008, the Casino Employees event has started {{on the first day of}} the WSOP. Much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> encountered at the Casino Championship often involves informal rivaliries between dealers and proposition players. Proposition players are people hired to play poker, with their own money, at casinos to get games started or to ensure that they do not die out. Thus, while both the prop and dealer are casino employees, they sit on opposite sides of the table.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes {{the text}} {{can give a}} basic outline that {{correlates}} to the four-movement scheme of a symphony. For instance, the four-part structure of Edgar Allan Poe's The Bells, a progression from youth to marriage, maturity, and death, naturally suggested the four movements of a symphony to Sergei Rachmaninoff, which he followed in his choral symphony of the same name. The text can encourage a composer to expand a choral symphony past the normal bounds of the symphonic genre, as with Berlioz for his Roméo et Juliette, yet stay within the basic structural or aesthetic intent of symphonic form. It can also influence the musical content in parts {{where there is no}} singing, as in Roméo et Juliette. There, Berlioz allows the orchestra to express the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>drama</b> in instrumental music and saves words for expository and narrative sections of the work.|$|E
