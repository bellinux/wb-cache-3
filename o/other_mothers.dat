Lori then tells her and Rick's son, Carl (Chandler Riggs) the news, causing him to break down in tears.|$|E
5|$|Ruffed lemurs are {{cooperative}} breeders, {{with parental}} care being {{shared by all}} community members. For example, mothers will stash their offspring with <b>other</b> <b>mothers</b> or leave them to be guarded by other community members, including non-breeding individuals of both genders. While the mother is away, community members will not only care for and guard them, but also sound alarm calls if danger is detected or if leaving the infant alone. They will also respond to alarm calls by others. These coordinated vigilance displays further involve communal transmission of the alarm call, with nearby community members repeating the alarm call, potentially summoning the mother back to her offspring. Infant transport by {{other members of the}} community has also been recorded. Females have been observed nursing infants of their close relatives, while close kin have adopted rejected infants, acting as foster parents.|$|E
5|$|Female California {{sea lions}} have a 12-month {{reproductive}} cycle, {{consisting of a}} 9-month actual gestation and a 3-month delayed implantation of the fertilized egg before giving birth in June or July. Interbirth intervals are particularly long for this species, being 21 days for sea lions off California and more than 30 days for sea lions in the Gulf of California. Females remain with their pups on shore for 10 days and nurse them. After this, females will go on foraging trips lasting as long as three days, returning to nurse their pups {{for up to a}} day. Pups left on shore tend to gather in nurseries to socialize and play. When returning from a trip, females call their pups with distinctive calls to which the pups will reply in kind. A mother and pup can distinguish each other's calls from those of <b>other</b> <b>mothers</b> and pups. At first, reunions largely depend on the efforts of the mothers. However, as pups get older, they get more involved in reunions. Older pups may sometimes join their mothers during their foraging trips. Adult male California sea lions play no role in raising pups, but they do take more interest in them than adult males of other otariid species; they have even been observed to help shield swimming pups from predators. Pups are weaned by a year but can continue to suckle for another year.|$|E
50|$|Coraline {{searches}} {{through the}} Other World and overcomes the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother's</b> obstacles by using her wits and Miss Spink's lucky stone {{to find the}} marble-like souls of the ghost children and deduces that her parents are imprisoned in a snow globe on the mantelpiece. The ghost children warn her that even if Coraline wins, the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> will not let them go, so Coraline tricks the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> by announcing that she knows where her parents are hidden: in the passageway between the worlds. The <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> cannot resist gloating by {{opening the door to}} show Coraline that her parents are not there. When the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> opens the door Coraline throws the cat at the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother,</b> grabs the snow globe, and escapes to the real world with the key, and the Cat quickly follows. While escaping, Coraline forces the door shut on the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother's</b> hand. Back in her home, Coraline falls asleep on a chair. She is awoken by her parents who have no memory of the events.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the third}} visit, the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> invites Coraline to stay forever, under the {{condition}} that a pair of buttons will be sewn over her eyes. Horrified, Coraline refuses the offer and attempts to flee. However, she discovers that all the exits to the real world have been blocked by the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother.</b> The cat appears and reveals her the sinister truth about the Other World and the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother.</b> Coraline demands the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> to let her return home but the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> suddenly grows taller and more grotesque and imprisons her behind a mirror. There, Coraline meets the ghosts of her previous victims, including the long-lost twin sister of Wybie's grandmother. The ghosts reveal that the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother,</b> whom they refer to as the Beldam, created and sent button-eyed ragdolls that resembled them in order to spy on their lives. She eventually lured them into the Other World, under the promise of a better life, where she sewed buttons over their eyes and consumed their lives. To free their souls, their real eyes, hidden in special objects, need to be retrieved. Coraline promises to return their eyes.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the small}} dark closet space, she meets three ghost children.

They tell Coraline how the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> {{eventually}} grew bored with them, and eventually they died and she cast their spirits aside, but they are trapped there because she has kept their souls. If their souls can be rescued from the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother,</b> then the ghosts can pass on. The ghost children implore Coraline to escape and avoid their fate.|$|R
25|$|Lamia was a {{queen of}} Libya, whom Zeus loved. Hera turned {{her into a}} monster and murdered their {{children}}. Or, alternatively, she killed Lamia's children and the grief turned her into a monster. Lamia was cursed with the inability to close her eyes {{so that she would}} always obsess over the image of her dead children. Zeus gave her the gift {{to be able to take}} her eyes out to rest, and then put them back in. Lamia was envious of <b>other</b> <b>mothers</b> and ate their children.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} the Internet's {{influence}} has also influenced women's choices in infant feeding. The Internet has served as both a vector for formula advertisement and {{a means by which}} women can connect with <b>other</b> <b>mothers</b> to gain support and share experiences from breastfeeding. In addition, social media is a category of advertising that did not exist when the International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes was published; thus, while some advertising practices undertaken by formula companies on the Internet violated the Code, they did so in ways that could not have been anticipated.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people of}} sub-Saharan Africa choose to foster their {{children}} to infertile women. IVF enables these infertile women {{to have their own}} children, which imposes new ideals to a culture in which fostering children is seen as both natural and culturally important. Many infertile women are able to earn more respect in their society by taking care of the children of <b>other</b> <b>mothers,</b> and this may be lost if they choose to use IVF instead. As IVF is seen as unnatural, it may even hinder their societal position as opposed to making them equal with fertile women. It is also economically advantageous for infertile women to raise foster children as it gives these children greater ability to access resources that are important for their development and also aids the development of their society at large. If IVF becomes more popular without the birth rate decreasing, there could be more large family homes with fewer options to send their newborn children. This could result in an increase of orphaned children and/or a decrease in resources for the children of large families. This would ultimately stifle the children's and the community's growth.|$|E

2500|$|Many lurid {{details were}} conjured up by later writers, {{assembled}} in the Suda, expanded upon in Renaissance poetry and collected in Bulfinch and in Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable: Lamia was envious of <b>other</b> <b>mothers</b> and ate their children. [...] She was usually female, but Aristophanes suggests a hermaphroditic phallus. [...] Leinweber notes, [...] "By the time of Apuleius, not only were Lamia characteristics liberally mixed into popular notions of sorcery, but at some level the very names were interchangeable." [...] Nicolas K. Kiessling compared the lamia with the medieval succubus and Grendel's mother in Beowulf.|$|E
2500|$|Normally, Bowlby saw {{his mother}} only one {{hour a day}} after teatime, though during the summer she was more available. Like many <b>other</b> <b>mothers</b> of her social class, she {{considered}} that parental attention and affection would lead to dangerous spoiling of the children. Bowlby was lucky in that the nanny in his family was present throughout his childhood. When Bowlby was almost four years old, his beloved nursemaid Minnie who was actually his primary caregiver in his early years, left the family. Later, he was to describe this as tragic as {{the loss of a}} mother. Bowlby was extremely affected by the loss of his nursemaid Minnie as she acted as his mother substitute in a warm and nurturing way like a mother. When nursemaid Minnie left the family, Bowlby and his siblings were under the primary care of Nanny Friend who was less than nurturing with Bowlby and his siblings due to her cold and sarcastic nature. This early loss of Bowlby's [...] "mother-figure" [...] fuelled his interest later in life around what is now known as attachment theory.|$|E
5000|$|After Coraline {{returns to}} the copy of her flat, the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> offers Coraline the {{opportunity}} {{to stay in the}} Other World forever, but in order to do so, Coraline must allow buttons to be sewn into her eyes. Coraline is horrified and returns through the door to her home. Upon her return to her apartment, Coraline finds that her real parents are missing. They do not return the next day, and the black cat wakes her and takes her to a mirror in her hallway, through which she can see her trapped parents. They signal to her by writing [...] "Help Us" [...] on the glass, from which Coraline deduces the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> has kidnapped them. Though frightened of returning, Coraline goes back to the Other World to confront the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> and rescue her parents. In the garden, Coraline is prompted by the cat to challenge the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother,</b> as âher kind of thing loves games and challengesâ. The <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> tries to convince Coraline to stay, but Coraline refuses, and is locked within a small space behind a mirror as punishment.|$|R
50|$|After the <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> {{releases}} Coraline {{from the}} mirror, Coraline proposes a game: {{if she can}} find the ghost children's souls and her parents, then she, her parents, and the ghost children may go free.

40|$|The <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> {{represents}} {{the act of}} human conception, birth, and nurturing from an artist/man/fatherâs perspective. The work attempts to reconcile the divide between this ultimate creation and the creative process that we confront through art. The result is a masculinized nursery composed of a chopperized pram, a crib and rocker with hard edges and superhero symbols, and walls decorated with oversized, graphic images. To create the pieces in this installation, I worked closely with men in the traditional masculine trades of automobile customizing, welding, woodcraft, and upholstering. The resulting work is flashy and clean, without the hominess and earthy sensuality {{that come with the}} traditional feminine idea of motherhood. This difference between The <b>Other</b> <b>Mother,</b> my creation, and the child created by a true mother touches on the essence of what motherhood is. This paper examines the process of discovering motherhood by exploring The <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> from a symbolist perspective. It considers symbolism as developed by the Freemasons, Structuralists, and the Symbolist Movement. It compares aspects of The <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> to works by Constantin Brancusi, Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Georgia OâKeefe, Joseph Beuys, Robert Irwin, Matthew Barney, and Liz Cohen. Freemasons and Structuralists believe that symbols donât merely represent, but they also create something new. Examining The <b>Other</b> <b>Mother</b> from a symbolist perspective may help the work to achieve its purpose...|$|R

He does not work, however; he merely occupies the study, as he is not permitted to talk to Coraline by himself. He is much more fun than Coraline's real father and always tries to be cheerful and fun in front of Coraline. In reality, the Other Father is sad and nervous.

ABSTRACT: This {{thesis is}} focused on the reading {{literacy}} issues of pupils with <b>other</b> <b>mother</b> tongue in primary education. The aim of this work is to analyse and describe the contemporary state of reading literacy skills of pupils with <b>other</b> <b>mother</b> tongue in inclusive education context. The foreigners children have to overcome the social and cultural differences as well as the language barrier. In order to be successfully included into the education system, and consequently into our society, the pupils need to learn Czech language at the best level they are able to. The structure of this work is divided into two parts - the theoretical and practical one. There were quantitative and qualitative methods used in the research. The individual aims of this work were analysed, processed and discussed {{based on the results of}} the two research phases and description of good practice examples from Finland. Finally the conclusions and suggestions were expressed.
