500|$|Coprinellus micaeus was {{illustrated}} in a woodcut by the 16th-century botanist Carolus Clusius {{in what is}} arguably the first published monograph on fungi, the 1601 Rariorum plantarum historia. Fungorum in Pannoniis observatorum brevis historia (History of rare plants. Brief history of fungi observed in Pannonia [...] ). Clusius erroneously believed the species to be poisonous, and classified it as a genus of Fungi perniciales (harmful fungi). The species was first described scientifically by French botanist Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard in 1786 as Agaricus micaceus in his work Herbier de la France. In 1801, Christian Hendrik Persoon grouped together all of the gilled fungi that auto-digested (deliquesced) during spore discharge into the section Coprinus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> <b>Agaricus.</b> Elias Magnus Fries later raised Persoon's section Coprinus to genus rank in his Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici, and the species became known as Coprinus micaceus. It was the type species of subsection Exannulati in section Micacei of the genus Coprinus, a grouping of related taxa with veils made of sphaerocysts (round swollen cells usually formed in clusters) exclusively or with thin-filamentous connective hyphae intermixed. [...] Molecular studies published in the 1990s demonstrated {{that many of the}} coprinoid (Coprinus-like) mushrooms were in fact unrelated to each other. This culminated in a 2001 revision of the genus Coprinus, which was split into four genera; C.micaeus was transferred to Coprinellus.|$|E

50|$|Extracts <b>of</b> {{mushrooms}} from <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> <b>Agaricus</b> {{have been}} used for generations as traditional Chinese herbal remedies. Some of these extracts have been shown to possess antiviral properties, and investigators have identified agaritine as a prominent compound in the extracts.

Computer modelling research is currently being conducted in an attempt to optimize binding for potential use as an anti-HIV drug.|$|R
5000|$|Christian Hendrik Persoon first {{circumscribed}} <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> Russula in his 1796 work Observationes Mycologicae, {{and considered}} the defining characteristics to be the fleshy fruit bodies, depressed cap, and equal gills. He reduced it to <b>the</b> rank <b>of</b> tribe in <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> <b>Agaricus</b> in 1801. Elias Fries similarly regarded Russula as a tribe of Agaricus in his influential Systema Mycologicum (1821), but later (1825) raised it to <b>the</b> rank <b>of</b> <b>genus</b> in <b>the</b> Systema Orbis Vegetabilis. Around the same time, Samuel Frederick Gray also recognized Russula as a genus in his 1821 work <b>The</b> Natural Arrangement <b>of</b> British Plants. <b>The</b> name Russula {{is derived from the}} Latin word russus, meaning [...] "red".|$|R
50|$|Agaritine (1) {{was long}} thought by {{biologists}} to emanate from shikimate (4), with the glutamate moiety clearly originating from glutamic acid.This assumption was made purely by inference: a similar compound, γ-glutaminyl-4-hydroxybenzene (5) {{is produced in}} <b>the</b> fruiting body <b>of</b> mushrooms in <b>the</b> <b>genus</b> <b>Agaricus</b> with similar abundance to agaritine and {{has been shown to}} be derived from the shikimate biosynthetic pathway. Recent work, however, has uncovered several problems with this hypothesis, of which inconsistencies in radiolabeling experiments are most notable. These recent efforts now assert that the molecule is synthesized in the vegetative mycelium and then translocated into the fruiting body. These researchers posit that the p-hydroxybenzoic acid moiety (6) is absorbed directly from the lignin on which the fungus feeds, not produced by the fungus itself (Figure 2).Despite recent work, however, experts still acknowledge <b>the</b> nebulous origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hydrazine functionality. Two theoretical mechanisms are postulated: oxidative coupling of two amines via a phenolic radical mechanism or fixation of nitrogen via nitrogenase.|$|R

40|$|Gourmet {{mushrooms}} {{may contribute}} to <b>the</b> development <b>of</b> a new agriculture by addressing the consumer demand and some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> non-nutritional uses <b>of</b> agricultural productions. <b>The</b> value <b>of</b> recycling with gourmet and medicinal mushrooms is clearly understood and wastes {{can be viewed as}} positive products, at least in term of providing new economic opportunities and positive environmental consequences. Important cultivated edible and medicinal mushrooms are members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agaricus</b> <b>genus.</b> They are saprophytic fungi acting as secondary decomposers in forest litter. The button mushroom is Agaricus bisporus cultivated as a gourmet mushroom since the 18 th century and high yields are now obtained in sophisticated farms in western countries. Its potential as a medicinal mushroom has recently been shown. Throughout the world <b>the</b> cultivation <b>of</b> this mushroom is developing in small and mid-sized farms, but the technical knowledge and the strains have been developed for cultivation in high-tech large farms. Needs for small-scale farming are simple cultivation processes using rustic strains able to fruit under various conditions, and strains with stable contents in active ingredients, whatever the cultivation conditions. By using available biodiversity and breeding, one can expect to develop homogeneous, vigorous and rustic strains with good productivity and commercial quality.
