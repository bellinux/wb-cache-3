5|$|As {{the first}} widely read {{political}} novel in the United States, Uncle Tom's Cabin greatly influenced development {{of not only}} American literature but also protest literature in general.

5|$|As a manifesto, this {{paragraph}} became {{significant for the}} amalgamation of symphonic and dramatic elements in the same musical composition. Musicologist Hugh MacDonald writes that as Berlioz kept the idea of symphonic construction closely in mind, he allowed the orchestra to express {{the majority of the}} drama in instrumental music and set expository and narrative sections in words. Fellow musicologist Nicholas Temperley suggests that, in Roméo, Berlioz created a model for how a dramatic text could guide the structure of a choral symphony without circumventing that work from being recognizably a symphony. In this sense, musicologist Mark Evans Bonds writes, the symphonies of Liszt and Mahler <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> debt of influence to Berlioz.|$|E
25|$|The first ground, <b>owing</b> to <b>a</b> {{predominance}} of ratnas or jewels, is called Ratnaprabha. Similarly, the second, <b>owing</b> to <b>a</b> {{predominance of}} sarkara or gravel, is called Sarkraprabha. The third <b>owing</b> to <b>a</b> predominance of valuka or sands, is called Valukaprabha. The fourth, <b>owing</b> to <b>an</b> excess of panka or mud, is called Pankaprabha. The fifth, <b>owing</b> to <b>an</b> excess of dhuma or smoke, is called Dhumaprabha. The sixth, <b>owing</b> to <b>a</b> marked possession of tamas or darkness, is called Tamahprabha, while the seventh, <b>owing</b> to <b>a</b> {{high concentration of}} mahatamas or dense darkness, is called Mahatamahprabha.|$|R

5|$|Being unemployed, {{we spent}} {{almost all of}} each weekday at the school, so if a tuition fee had been applicable, Mrs Mac would have earned a tidy sum of money. That, of course, was not her way of doing things. She {{required}} no payment for the training she provided, and I suspect that she was quite out of pocket over the whole affair... It would be true {{to say that a}} great number of the pilots whose futures were finally fulfilled in airlines in Australia <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> deal to Mrs Mac... There was no other school operating in Sydney at the time, providing Morse training to potential airline pilots, and no other school then or thereafter giving such training completely free of charge.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because we are only obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E

25|$|Cul-de-sac (1966) is a bleak nihilist tragicomedy filmed on {{location}} in Northumberland. The tone and premise of the film <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> great deal to Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot, along with aspects of Harold Pinter's The Birthday Party.|$|E
25|$|The gravamen of this charge, then, is that Catholics {{constitute}} an imperium in imperio, {{a sort of}} fifth column of persons who <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> greater allegiance to the Pope than they do to the civil government, a charge {{very similar to that}} repeatedly leveled against Jews. Accordingly, a large body of British laws, such as the Popery Act 1698, collectively known as the Penal Laws, imposed various civil disabilities and legal penalties on recusant Catholics.|$|E
50|$|The {{duty of care}} <b>owed</b> to <b>a</b> rescuer is {{separate}} from that owed to those he is rescuing. Where individuals trespassed onto a railway line, putting themselves in danger, they were not <b>owed</b> <b>a</b> duty of care; however, the stationmaster who attempted rescue and was fatally injured was <b>owed</b> <b>a</b> duty of care, as it was foreseeable he would attempt a rescue. Equally, a duty of care may arise where an individual imperils himself, and a rescuer is injured, despite the individual clearly owing himself no duty of care.|$|R

25|$|These acts, {{exempted}} from the counterfeiting felony charge, would still fall under a lesser charge, {{with a fine}} to be defined by a decree (executive decision). Minister Donnedieu de Vabres has announced a €38 fine for downloading acts, but it is yet unknown whether this would apply to any single file (thus a person with 1000 songs downloaded illegally could in theory <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> fine of €38,000) or whether several downloads could be punished with a single fine.|$|E
25|$|David Kopf writes, “The {{triumph of}} the Sadharan Brahmos over the Keshubites {{on the issue of}} women’s {{emancipation}} clearly represents the impact of Unitarian social philosophy on Hindu society and culture. As the facts disclose, Unitarian impact was not merely intellectual or ideological. Through the advocacy and work of Carpenter and Akroyd, its impact was intrusively practical.” He goes on to conclude, “The relatively emancipated professional Indian woman of today <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> considerable debt of gratitude to the Brahmo pioneers of the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, a {{tradition}} of more literary science fiction novels, treating with a dissonance between perceived Utopian conditions and the full expression of human desires, began to develop: the dystopian novel. For some time, the science fictional elements of these works were ignored by mainstream literary critics, though they <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> much greater debt to the science fiction genre than the modernists do. Sincerely Utopian writing, including much of Wells, has also deeply influenced science fiction, beginning with Hugo Gernsback's Ralph 124C 41+.|$|E

The House of Lords held that the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire did not <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> duty of care to the victim {{due to the lack of}} proximity and therefore failing on the second limb of the Caparo test.|$|E
25|$|The midwifery {{model of}} {{pregnancy}} and childbirth {{as a normal}} and healthy process plays a much larger role in Sweden and the Netherlands {{than the rest of}} Europe, however. Swedish midwives stand out, since they administer 80 percent of prenatal care and more than 80 percent of family planning services in Sweden. Midwives in Sweden attend all normal births in public hospitals and Swedish women tend to have fewer interventions in hospitals than American women. The Dutch infant mortality rate in 1992 was the tenth-lowest rate in the world, at 6.3 deaths per thousand births, while the United States ranked twenty-second. Midwives in the Netherlands and Sweden <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> great deal of their success to supportive government policies.|$|E
25|$|I <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> lot to R. B. Woodward. He {{showed me}} that one could attack {{difficult}} problems without {{a clear idea of}} their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He {{showed me that}} one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.|$|E

Pelham Dale, Rector of St. Vedast, Foster Lane, in the City of London; Sidney Faithorn Green, Rector of St John's, Miles Platting; and James Bell Cox, Vicar of St. Margaret's, Liverpool.... To these brave priests and many others who suffered we <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> great tribute of thankfulness and praise, for it was through their determination to stand by the Church in her hour of peril that we have won the tolerance and liberty we have today.

25|$|Stubbs, that we <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> {{distinguishing}} feature of parish life still active today – the parish choir. Organ {{music has been}} part of parish life almost from the beginning, as was a parish choir, although from available records the quality of the early music program was not high. It is said that shortly after he became rector, Elisha Brooks Joyce received complaints {{about the quality of the}} music, so that he appointed George Wilmot, the parish’s first professional chorister. A decade later Wilmot was appointed the first music director and in 1893 he established a formally vested men’s and boys’ choir, which first performed for the Easter Service in 1894. The present Christ Church music program inherits the legacy established by Wilmot.|$|E
25|$|Pantisocracy {{presented}} Coleridge {{a practical}} outlet for ideas {{he had previously}} only considered theoretically. While the scheme never produced an actual community, it did impact Coleridge's philosophical thinking. His lectures of the time reflect his Pantisocratic thinking on social relations and wealth. He wrote of the scheme years afterward that it was “a plan as harmless as it was extravagant” {{but it can be}} argued that much of the fantastic imagery and political thoughts present in his work <b>owe</b> <b>a</b> debt both to Pantisocracy and to the research he conducted in preparation for his voyage. On a literal level, perhaps the greatest impact Pantisocracy had on the young Coleridge was the addition of Sara Fricker (and their subsequent family) to his life.|$|E
