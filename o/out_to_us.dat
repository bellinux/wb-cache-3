500|$|Upon Eraserhead release, Variety {{offered a}} {{negative}} review, calling it [...] "a sickening bad-taste exercise". The review expressed incredulity over the film's long gestation and described its finale as unwatchable. Comparing Eraserhead to Lynch's next film The Elephant Man, Tom Buckley of The New York Times felt {{that while the}} latter was a well-made film with an accomplished cast, the former was not. Buckley called Eraserhead [...] "murkily pretentious", and felt that the film's horror aspects stemmed solely from {{the appearance of the}} deformed child rather than from its script or performances. Writing in 1984, Lloyd Rose of The Atlantic felt that Eraserhead demonstrated that Lynch was [...] "one of the most unalloyed surrealists ever to work in the movies". Rose described the film as being intensely personal, finding that unlike previous surrealist films, such as Luis Buñuel's 1929 work Un Chien Andalou or 1930's L'Age d'Or, Lynch's imagery [...] "isn't reaching <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> from his films; we're sinking into them". In a 1993 review for the Chicago Tribune, Michael Wilmington described Eraserhead as unique, feeling that the film's [...] "intensity" [...] and [...] "nightmare clarity" [...] were a result of Lynch's attention to detail in its creation due to his involvement in so many roles during its production. In the 1995 essay Bad Ideas: The Art and Politics of Twin Peaks, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum felt that Eraserhead represented Lynch's best work. Rosenbaum felt that the director's artistic talent declined as his popularity grew, and contrasted the film with Wild at Heart—Lynch's most recent feature film at that time—saying [...] "even the most cursory comparison of Eraserhead with Wild at Heart reveals an artistic decline so precipitous {{that it is hard to}} imagine the same person making both films".|$|E

2500|$|Speaking of {{the video}} to MTV, Reynolds said [...] "We read through a ton of scripts from really talented directors, and we came across one that stood <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> in particular, because it put into visuals the general theme of the song, {{which is kind of}} an {{empowering}} song about an awakening, but it did {{it in a way that}} was very different".

[...] "When our son came <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> {{at the age of}} 21, we at that stage were just broken for him that he, in a gay-friendly household, had not felt able to confide in us his loneliness, the bullying that he was exposed to", she said.|$|E

2500|$|GamesRadar's Brent Goodsmith {{scored the}} game 4 out of 5. He {{felt it was}} a button masher, arguing that attacking [...] "is {{executed}} via the trusted medium of button bashing.

[...] However, he didn't see this as an inherent problem; [...] "regardless of how it is achieved, the result is much the same: oodles of rapid-fire killing and the satisfaction of hacking up enemies more numerous than in any console action game that has gone before." [...] He concluded [...] "Spartan does things {{right out of the box}} that the première hack-and-slash series Dynasty Warriors, about to release its tenth PS2 entry, has yet to achieve." ...|$|E

[...] In a highly organized and rigidly structured environment, he stood <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> as the perfect role model - a gentleman, a scholar, a friend and later a confidant. [...] He led by example and set his students on a path of personal and individual achievement unhampered by his own prejudices and influences. As a result, Stanley sent his students into the world equipped to make up their own minds and not just echo what they had been taught." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mississauga mayor Hazel McCallion {{initially}} expressed pessimism over Miller's 'One-cent now' campaign, {{stating that}} [...] "I {{can assure you}} our citizens [...] can’t point <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> where there’s a lot of waste. Toronto, unfortunately, has that situation, in which their citizens are saying it, {{as well as their}} board of trade has been saying it and even their own councillors are saying it". Denzil Minnan-Wong compared the two mayors, saying [...] "Hazel McCallion runs a tight ship. David Miller’s ship has leaks all over the place,” and some commentators suggested that Toronto would have a difficult time making a credible case to the federal government for funding. She unveiled her own plan known as 'Cities Now!' to get federal funding for municipal infrastructure. However, McCallion's proposal did not receive support during a meeting with fifteen regional mayors, and she agreed to support Miller's campaign.|$|E
2500|$|While touring with The Sign of the Rose, Beban {{spoke of}} the {{contributions}} of the Italian in civilization and noted: [...] "The swarming port of Naples courses him <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> every day, its traffic lines beating like a great throbbing artery of life. [...] In the main he is poor and despised, and sometimes, though not as often as the sensationalists of the police courts would have us believe, he is rejected. [...] But even at his worst he contains a fund of humanity which {{it is almost impossible to}} duplicate in any other people as a whole. [...] His passions are so manifest that they are the very essence of the theatre. [...] He loves intensely, he adopts children, he is fiery in his friendships and hates alike, and his experiences in getting Americanized furnish a far greater fund of comedy than the wearisome peanut-stand mirth to which the 'scene-in-one' artists have accustomed us." ...|$|E
2500|$|John, however, clearly {{identifies}} Mary of Bethany {{with the}} woman who anointed Christ's feet (12; cf. [...] and [...] ). It is remarkable that already in , John has spoken of Mary as [...] "she that anointed the Lord's feet", he aleipsasa. It is commonly said that he refers to the subsequent anointing which he himself describes in {{but it may be}} questioned whether he would have used he aleipsasa if another woman, and she a [...] "sinner" [...] in the city, had done the same. It is conceivable that John, just because he is writing so long after the event {{and at a time when}} Mary was dead, wishes to point <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> that she was really the same as the [...] "sinner." [...] In the same way Luke may have veiled her identity precisely because he did not wish to defame one who was yet living; he certainly does something similar in the case of St. Matthew whose identity with Levi the publican (5:7) he conceals. If the foregoing argument holds good, Mary of Bethany and the [...] "sinner" [...] are one and the same.|$|E

2500|$|The 1974 {{aluminum}} cent was a one-cent coin {{proposed by}} the United States Mint in 1973. It was composed of an alloy of aluminum and trace metals, and intended to replace the predominantly copper–zinc cent due to the rising costs of coin production in the traditional bronze alloy. [...] 1,571,167 were struck in anticipation of release, but none were released into circulation. Examples were passed <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>US</b> Congressmen {{in a bid to}} win favor in switching to the new alloy. When the proposed aluminum cent was rejected, the Mint recalled and destroyed the examples. A few aluminum cents not returned to the Mint are believed to remain in existence. [...] One example was donated to the Smithsonian Institution, while another was alleged to have been found by a US Capitol Police Officer. [...] A 1974-D specimen was found in January 2014 by Randall Lawrence, who said it was a retirement gift to his father, who worked at the Mint in Denver. Randall planned on selling it in a public auction, but the Mint demanded its return, saying that the coin was never authorized for release and therefore remains U.S. Government property. Lawrence (and his business partner at their coin store, Michael McConnell) ultimately surrendered the coin when the Mint showed that the aluminum penny had never been authorized to be struck in Denver, and {{there was no evidence that}} the coin had been a gift of any kind.|$|E
