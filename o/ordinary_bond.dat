The author of the publication decided to explore what kind of benefits an enterprise issuing bonds and a bondholder would receive as exemplified by a hypothetical investment, using various (aforementioned) sources of foreign capital. The article is composed of four parts. The introduction hereto outlines some general assumptions and the purpose of the study. The second part of the article includes the assumptions for the aforementioned comparative analysis. It was suggested that since such variables as the price of raw materials, shares and operating costs of a company are difficult to determine, they should be distributed so that on the basis thereof the final NPV may be established by applying the Monte Carlo method. The third part of the study focuses on the examination (comparison) of the bonds convertible to raw materials in the context of <b>ordinary</b> <b>bonds</b> and bonds convertible to shares. The result of such an analysis is the NPV histogram for particular sources of financing, a probability distribution defining the probability of occurring individual NPV values.

Here, lightweight and <b>ordinary</b> concrete-steel <b>bond</b> strength {{is determined by}} pull-out test {{for a variety of}} specimens in various configurations. For each specimen, a {{bond strength}}-slip curve is obtained through monotonic loading. Following this process, an identical specimen is subjected to cyclic loading under similar conditions using the same test setup. These examinations reveal several insights. Lightweight concrete-steel bond strength is greater than the <b>ordinary</b> concrete-steel <b>bond</b> strength for plain steel bars under monotonic loading. <b>Ordinary</b> concrete-steel <b>bond</b> strength is greater than lightweight concrete-steel bond strength under both monotonic and cyclic loading for deformed steel bars.

40|$|Consider <b>ordinary</b> <b>bond</b> {{percolation}} on {{a finite}} or countably infinite graph. Let s, t, a and b be vertices. An earlier paper [3] proved the (nonintuitive) result that, conditioned on {{the event that}} there is no open path from s to t, the two events “there is an open path from s to a” and “there is an open path from s to b ” are positively correlated. In the present paper we further investigate and generalize the theorem of which this result was a consequence. This leads to results saying, informally, that, with the above conditioning, the open cluster of s is conditionally positively (self-) associated and that it is conditionally negatively correlated with the open cluster of t. We also present analogues of some of our results for (a) randomcluster measures, and (b) directed percolation and contact processes, and observe that the latter lead to improvements of some of the results in a paper of Belitsky, Ferrari, Konno and Liggett (1997) ...|$|E
40|$|We study bond {{percolation}} evolving in time {{in such a}} {{way that}} the edges turn on and off independently according to a continuous time stationary 2 -state Markov chain. Asking whether an infinite open cluster exists for a. e. t reduces (by Fubini's Theorem) to <b>ordinary</b> <b>bond</b> percolation. We ask whether "a. e. t" can be replaced by "every t" and show that for sub- and supercritical percolation the answer is yes (for any graph), while at criticality the answer is no for certain graphs. For instance, there exist graphs which do not percolate at criticality for a. e. t, but do percolate for some exceptional t. We show that for ZZ d, d 19, there is a. s. no infinite open cluster for all t at criticality. We give a sharp criterion for a general tree to have an infinite open cluster for some t, in terms of the effective conductance of the tree (analogous to a criterion of R.

40|$|<b>Ordinary</b> <b>bond</b> {{percolation}} (OP) can {{be viewed}} as a process where clusters grow by joining them pairwise, by adding links chosen randomly one by one from a set of predefined `virtual' links. In contrast, in agglomerative percolation (AP) clusters grow by choosing randomly a `target cluster' and joining it with all its neighbors, as defined by the same set of virtual links. Previous studies showed that AP is in different universality classes from OP for several types of (virtual) networks (linear chains, trees, Erdos-Renyi networks), but most surprising were the results for 2 -d lattices: While AP on the triangular lattice was found to be in the OP universality class, it behaved completely differently on the square lattice. In the present paper we explain this striking violation of universality by invoking bipartivity. While the square lattice is a bipartite graph, the triangular lattice is not. In conformity with this we show that AP on the honeycomb and simple cubic (3 -d) lattices [...] both of which are bipartite [...] are also not in the OP universality classes. More precisely, we claim that this violation of universality is basically due to a Z_ 2 symmetry that is spontaneously broken at the percolation threshold. We also discuss AP on bipartite random networks and suitable generalizations of AP on k-partite graphs. Comment: 11 pages, including 18 figure...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a portfolio containing CDO tranches {{as well as}} <b>ordinary</b> <b>bonds.</b> Our interest is in large loss probabilities and risk measures such as value-at-risk. When loss is measured on a mark-to-market basis, estimation via simulation requires a nested procedure: In the outer step one draws realizations of all risk factors up to the horizon, and in the inner step one re-prices each instrument in the portfolio at the horizon conditional on the drawn risk factors. Practitioners perceive the computational burden of such nested schemes to be unacceptable, and adopt a variety of somewhat ad hoc measures to avoid the inner simulation. In this paper, we question whether such short cuts are necessary. We show that {{a relatively small number}} of trials in the inner step can yield accurate estimates, and analyze how a fixed computational budget may be allocated to the inner and the outer step to minimize the mean square error of the resultant estimator. ...|$|R

Greece forced acquiescence to its terms from a large number of its bonds by using a variety of legal strong-arm tactics. With the vast majority of Greek bonds, the tactics worked. There were, however, thirty-six bonds guaranteed by the Greek state, which, because of the weakness of the underlying companies, were effectively obligations of the Greek state. Yet, on these thirty six bonds, even though Greece desperately needed every euro of respite it could get, no restructuring was even attempted. Why not?

Both {{of these}} {{relations}} are isovalent (involve {{the same number}} of valence electrons and can be realized [17, 18] by placing lithium counter-ions in suitable positions. This has been known as the Si 6 Li 6 →C 6 H 6 (9) replacement rule of thumb. Such bonding properties are reflected in the structure, symmetry and occupation of the frontier orbitals through which these simple ideas can be strictly formalized, classified and theoretically implemented. Analogous ideas have been applied for the silicon and carbon fullerenes [6 – 9] which are similar because they are similarly sp 3 bonded (not sp 2 as in the real carbon fullerenes). Such a formulation has lead to the isolobal principle (analogy) [25]. The isolobal analogy was introduced about 30 years ago by Hoffman [25] in order to allow the correlation of seemingly very different chemical species, such as organic hydrocarbon fragments, with transition metal ligands. Two fragments are isolobal if the number, symmetry properties, approximate energy and shape of the frontier orbitals, as well as the number of electrons in them, are similar (but not identical). Although it seems strange, CH, Co(CO) 3 or NH 3, Co(CO) 4 can be considered as classical examples of pairs of isolobal fragments. Closer examination reveals that all these fragments need {{the same number of}} missing electrons in order to reach a stable electronic configuration. For example, CH has five valence electrons and, therefore, it needs three more to reach the stable configuration of eight. Likewise, Co(CO) 3 which has 15 valence electrons misses the stable configuration of 18 by three electrons. These fragments or building blocks can replace each other in more complex structures and can combine to form <b>ordinary</b> <b>bonds.</b>|$|R
