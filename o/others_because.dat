5|$|Marsh {{was born}} into the Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar, which sits on the Clarence River in {{northern}} New South Wales. His surname {{is believed to have}} possibly derived from that of Francis Henry Marsh, whose property Camira was separated from Yulgilbar by the Richmond Range. Details of Marsh's itinerant pre-cricket life are scarce, because Aborigines were not on the electoral roll and Marsh had no written correspondence with <b>others</b> <b>because</b> he was illiterate.|$|E
5|$|Tests {{have shown}} that all divers are {{affected}} by nitrogen narcosis, though some experience lesser effects than others. Even though {{it is possible that}} some divers can manage better than <b>others</b> <b>because</b> of learning to cope with the subjective impairment, the underlying behavioral effects remain. These effects are particularly dangerous because a diver may feel they are not experiencing narcosis, yet still be affected by it.|$|E
5|$|Carrington and Johnson {{speculated that}} Leigh was {{assaulted}} {{by the group}} of boys after returning from the beach, as punishment for complaining about being raped, and was murdered by Webster and two <b>others</b> <b>because</b> they were afraid she would tell other people. They refused to specifically name the two other suspects for fear of legal repercussions, though clarified that one had sexually assaulted Leigh earlier in the night, and the other likely sexually assaulted her with a beer bottle before she died, as punishment for publicly refusing {{to have sex with}} him. Webster talked to the media about the murder {{for the first time in}} 1997, and insisted that he acted alone in killing Leigh.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1820s, a mulatto trader from Gorée, Pierre Baudin, moved to Itou and began {{planting}} rice and producing lime by crushing the shells of mangrove oysters and cooking them in lime kilns. The French administration treated Baudin as their representative {{on the island}} and did not send <b>others</b> <b>because</b> few of the French wanted to live on the island. Being wet and marshy, Carabane had a reputation for its poor sanitation. The local economy was based mainly on weedy rice, which was sold in Ziguinchor or to the British in The Gambia. The Baudin family used slaves to produce the rice and, despite the declaration of its official abolition in the French colonial empire in 1848, slavery continued on the island until the early 20th century.|$|E
5|$|William Joseph Hammer {{started to}} collect {{incandescent}} light bulbs from 1879 {{while they were}} being developed in the Edison laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey. He was an associate of Thomas Edison and in his engineering career {{he was able to}} collect early filament electric light bulbs from Edison and <b>others</b> <b>because</b> of his association in the field. The Hammer collection is the most comprehensive collection of incandescent electric light bulbs known in the world. It shows the technology development of the filament electric light bulb during Thomas Edison's lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Aboriginal {{versions}} of the story also exist. In 1987, an elderly Aboriginal man from nearby Kingston related {{a version of the}} story, in which Brown shot some Aboriginal people and poisoned <b>others</b> <b>because</b> they were stealing his sheep. Brown then established his alibi by riding to Adelaide. In the same year Hastings' account was reproduced verbatim in Tom McCourt and Hans Mincham's The Coorong and Lakes of the Lower Murray. Three years later, the South Australian Education Department published an Aboriginal studies book for secondary students. It repeated Hastings' version, and followed it with an Aboriginal version told by a Ngarrindjeri man, George Trevorrow, whose family were from the Guichen Bay area. Trevorrow described the exploitation of Aboriginal workers by white settlers, and stated that when times were lean, Aboriginal people would steal flour from landowners. He did not name Brown, but stated that a settler poisoned some flour and rode for Adelaide to establish an alibi. Foster et al. note that while these two accounts were similar, the difference was that Hastings portrayed Brown as a victim of Aboriginal attacks, while Trevorrow emphasised white exploitation of Aboriginal people.|$|E

5|$|The Path of the Wizard {{continues}} {{immediately after}} {{the events of the}} first level. The remains of the Uruk-hai and orc army flee into Fangorn Forest. However, within the forest, the Ents, led by Treebeard, have awoken and joined the fight against Sauron. Gandalf helps the ents as they destroy the rest of the army, and then assists them in bringing down a dam holding back the River Isen. This floods Isengard, trapping Saruman (Christopher Lee), who had joined forces with Sauron, in his tower, Orthanc. Gandalf and Pippin (Billy Boyd) then head to Minas Tirith, capital of Gondor, leaving Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and the Rohirrim to follow them. Gandalf has gone ahead of the <b>others</b> <b>because</b> Sauron mistakenly believes that Pippin has the Ring, and Gandalf plans to use this confusion to distract Sauron as Frodo and Sam are led by Gollum (Andy Serkis) towards Mount Doom to destroy the Ring. In Minas Tirth, Gandalf helps repulse the enemies from the walls for a time, but eventually, they break through the city's defenses. Gandalf and the soldiers of Minas Tirith then retreat to a courtyard, where they must defend the fleeing civilians from the enemy. Once the people are safely inside, Gandalf can do little but await the arrival of Aragorn.|$|E
5|$|Rukia meets Ichigo in {{the midst}} of a hollow attack. After {{suffering}} her injuries, Rukia transfers her powers to Ichigo in order to save themselves. While he succeeds, Kuchiki is left too weak to return to Soul Society, and lives with Ichigo in the human world, intending to stay until her powers are restored. Therefore, her only ability then is her kidō spells, which are severely limited in strength and variety. She uses her kidō for such purposes as restraining, healing and attacking <b>others.</b> <b>Because</b> of the amount of time she spends with Ichigo, Rukia has been able to gain a keen understanding of his inner workings. Rukia's relationship with Ichigo is unique, for despite the relatively short amount of time they have known each other, Ichigo can easily confide in her and considers her a true friend because she is encouraging and understands what he is feeling. During her time in the human world, Rukia remains unaccounted for in Soul Society, so Byakuya Kuchiki and Renji Abarai are sent to find her and return her to the Soul Society. They succeed, and upon their return Rukia is sentenced to death for giving her Soul Reaper powers to a human. Kurosaki ultimately arrives in Soul Society in time to stop her execution, and tries to get her to safety.|$|E

25|$|The {{lobotomy}} procedure {{could have}} severe {{negative effects on}} a patient's personality and ability to function independently. Lobotomy patients often show a marked reduction in initiative and inhibition. They may also exhibit difficulty putting themselves {{in the position of}} <b>others</b> <b>because</b> of decreased cognition and detachment from society.|$|E
25|$|Many {{explanations}} for the optimistic bias come from the goals that people want and outcomes they wish to see. People tend to view their risks as less than <b>others</b> <b>because</b> they {{believe that this is}} what other people want to see. These explanations include self-enhancement, self-presentation, and perceived control.|$|E
50|$|Though in Secret Invasion, {{just like}} in Civil War, though for {{reasonably}} different incentives (they could not trust each <b>other</b> <b>because</b> of their own actions during the War, and they could not trust each <b>other</b> <b>because</b> {{of the actions of}} outside enemies during the Invasion), the Illuminati never worked together as a group, and the Illuminati itself is most likely to be permanently shattered. However, all six of them were affected in some way during the invasion, as were all inhabitants and allies of Earth.|$|R

You shall never say insults to each <b>other,</b> <b>because</b> insults among the married dishonors the one saying them, and proves the lack of judgment or common sense of election; and much less shall physically mistreat each <b>other,</b> <b>because</b> it is vile and cowardly to use force.|$|R

25|$|Adults with C-PTSD have {{sometimes}} experienced prolonged interpersonal traumatization as {{children as well}} as prolonged trauma as adults. This early injury interrupts the development of a robust sense of self and of <b>others.</b> <b>Because</b> physical and emotional pain or neglect was often inflicted by attachment figures such as caregivers or older siblings, these individuals may develop a sense that they are fundamentally flawed and that others cannot be relied upon.|$|E
