5|$|Both sides made changes {{going into}} the second ODI; for England, Sidebottom made way as England opted to hand a debut to Tredwell in order to play two spinners, while Bangladesh called on Shuvo and Rubel Hossain, {{dropping}} Siddique and Mortaza. For the second consecutive match, England won the toss and chose to field. The match began in similar fashion to the first ODI, with two quick wickets in the 10th and 11th overs taking Bangladesh from 46/0 to 56/2. However, a third-wicket partnership of 90 between Kayes and Rahim steadied the innings and helped Bangladesh to gain confidence. After Imrul Kayes' dismissal, Rahim increased his scoring-rate with a series <b>of</b> <b>boundaries</b> to take the score past 200, and was dismissed by a slower ball from Bresnan with the score at 211/5. Some late swinging from the tail saw Bangladesh finish on 260/6, their highest total in ODIs against England.|$|E
5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track the motion <b>of</b> <b>boundaries</b> between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material.

The same methods {{can also be used to}} simulate the curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a boundary or shock.|$|E

5|$|By {{the later}} {{years of the}} war, many Abenakis had tired of the {{conflict}} despite French pressures to continue raids against New England targets. The peace of Utrecht, however, had ignored Indian interests, and some Abenaki expressed willingness to negotiate a peace with the New Englanders. Governor Dudley organized a major peace conference at Portsmouth, New Hampshire (of which he was also governor). In negotiations there and at Casco Bay, the Abenakis objected to British assertions that the French had ceded to Britain the territory of eastern Maine and New Brunswick, but they agreed to a confirmation <b>of</b> <b>boundaries</b> at the Kennebec River {{and the establishment of}} government-run trading posts in their territory. The Treaty of Portsmouth was ratified on July 13, 1713 by eight representatives of some of the tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy; however, it included language asserting British sovereignty over their territory.

5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor in the assessment of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, <b>of</b> <b>boundaries</b> of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept and}} {{scenario}} draft {{was written by}} Takahashi and his wife Soraya Saga. Episode II was the last main Xenosaga game worked on by Saga prior to her leaving the project in 2005. Their draft was then turned into the game's full script by Norihiko Yonesaka, who was allowed by Takahashi to handle the storyline of the Xenosaga series following Episode I using his extensive notes. According to Takahashi, Yonesaka's role was to take his and Saga's notes {{and turn them into}} a workable game script, something which required parts of the planned scenario to be condensed or cut. According to Arai, the changes were made in consultation with Takahashi, with them treating his plan as a novel and the game as its movie adaptation. In a later interview, Saga said the changes made to the overall scenario for Episode II resulted in subsequent changes to the planned Xenosaga plotline. The game's subtitle is taken from the native title of Beyond Good and Evil, a novel written by German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. The use of Nietzsche's works and concepts was a recurring element in the series; in the context of Episode II, the subtitle was said to represent the blurring <b>of</b> <b>boundaries</b> between concepts of right and wrong, in addition to symbolizing the complex relations between Jr. and Albedo. As with the other Xenosaga titles, the game made heavy use of Biblical mythology.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{explores the}} role <b>of</b> <b>{{boundary}}</b> work and boundary objects in enhancing learning and innovation processes in hybrid multi-actor networks for sustainable agriculture ({LINSA}). Design/Methodology/Approach: Boundary work in {LINSA} is analysed {{on the basis}} of six case studies carried out in {SOLINSA} project under a common methodology. In developing typologies <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> work and objects, a grounded approach is used. Findings: {LINSA} analysis demonstrates the dynamic character, diverse forms and multiple functions <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> work and objects in three domains: learning, innovation, and sustainability. Addressing specific types of goals and actors leads to specific types <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> work and boundary objects. Context-appropriate boundary work allows aligning differing actor attitudes, gaining increased external support, and developing {LINSA}. The concepts <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> work and boundary objects are relevant in a broad range of divergent {LINSA} settings. Boundary work has its limitations, but its facilitation supports reaching {LINSA} goals. Practical Implications: The paper proposes recognising context-appropriate forms <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> work and skilful use <b>of</b> emerging <b>boundary</b> objects to both promote internal consolidation of {LINSA} and effective external communication to foster learning and innovation for sustainability. Originality/Value: The paper provides insights into the forms, dynamic and outcomes <b>of</b> <b>boundary</b> work in {LINSA} in three key domains: developing shared knowledge base, co-producing innovation and negotiating sustainability...|$|R
