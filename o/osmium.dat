5|$|Finely divided {{metallic}} <b>osmium</b> is pyrophoric and {{reacts with}} oxygen at room temperature, forming volatile <b>osmium</b> tetroxide. Some <b>osmium</b> compounds are also converted to the tetroxide if oxygen is present. This makes <b>osmium</b> tetroxide {{the main source}} of contact with the environment.|$|E
5|$|Like palladium, {{powdered}} <b>osmium</b> effectively absorbs hydrogen atoms. This {{could make}} <b>osmium</b> a potential {{candidate for a}} metal-hydride battery electrode. However, <b>osmium</b> is expensive and would react with potassium hydroxide, the most common battery electrolyte.|$|E
5|$|<b>Osmium</b> tetroxide {{has been}} used in {{fingerprint}} detection and in staining fatty tissue for optical and electron microscopy. As a strong oxidant, it cross-links lipids mainly by reacting with unsaturated carbon–carbon bonds and thereby both fixes biological membranes in place in tissue samples and simultaneously stains them. Because <b>osmium</b> atoms are extremely electron-dense, <b>osmium</b> staining greatly enhances image contrast in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies of biological materials. Those carbon materials have otherwise very weak TEM contrast (see image). Another <b>osmium</b> compound, <b>osmium</b> ferricyanide (OsFeCN), exhibits similar fixing and staining action.|$|E
5|$|The {{only known}} {{clinical}} use of <b>osmium</b> {{appears to be}} for synovectomy in arthritic patients in Scandinavia. It involves the local administration of <b>osmium</b> tetroxide (OsO4), which is a highly toxic compound. The lack of reports of long-term side effects suggest that <b>osmium</b> itself can be biocompatible, although this depends on the <b>osmium</b> compound administered. In 2011, osmium(VI) and osmium(II) compounds were reported to show anticancer activity in vivo, it indicated a promising future for using <b>osmium</b> compounds as anticancer drugs.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>osmium</b> {{is one of}} the even-numbered {{elements}}, {{which puts}} it in the upper half of elements commonly found in space, <b>osmium</b> is the least abundant stable element in Earth's crust with an average mass fraction of 50parts per trillion in the continental crust.|$|E
5|$|Only two <b>osmium</b> {{compounds}} {{have major}} applications: <b>osmium</b> tetroxide for staining tissue in electron microscopy {{and for the}} oxidation of alkenes in organic synthesis, and the non-volatile osmates for organic oxidation reactions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Osmium</b> {{has high}} {{reflectivity}} in the ultraviolet {{range of the}} electromagnetic spectrum; for example, at 600 Å <b>osmium</b> has a reflectivity twice that of gold. This high reflectivity is desirable in space-based UV spectrometers, which have reduced mirror sizes due to space limitations. Osmium-coated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the Space Shuttle, but {{it soon became clear}} that the oxygen radicals in the low Earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the <b>osmium</b> layer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Osmium</b> {{is found}} in nature as an uncombined element or in natural alloys; {{especially}} the iridium–osmium alloys, osmiridium (<b>osmium</b> rich), and iridosmium (iridium rich). In nickel and copper deposits, the platinum group metals occur as sulfides (i.e., (Pt,Pd)S)), tellurides (e.g., PtBiTe), antimonides (e.g., PdSb), and arsenides (e.g., PtAs2); in all these compounds platinum is exchanged by {{a small amount of}} iridium and <b>osmium.</b> As with all of the platinum group metals, <b>osmium</b> can be found naturally in alloys with nickel or copper.|$|E
5|$|<b>Osmium</b> tetroxide {{is highly}} {{volatile}} and penetrates skin readily, {{and is very}} toxic by inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact. Airborne low concentrations of <b>osmium</b> tetroxide vapor can cause lung congestion and skin or eye damage, and should therefore {{be used in a}} fume hood. <b>Osmium</b> tetroxide is rapidly reduced to relatively inert compounds by polyunsaturated vegetable oils, such as corn oil.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium and <b>osmium</b> {{have very}} similar {{chemistry}} {{due to the}} lanthanide contraction, but iron shows some differences from them: for example, although ruthenium and <b>osmium</b> form stable tetroxides in which the metal is in the +8 oxidation state, iron does not. Consequently, {{in preparation for the}} chemical characterization of hassium, researches focused on ruthenium and <b>osmium</b> rather than iron, as hassium was expected to also be similar to ruthenium and <b>osmium</b> due to the actinide contraction. Nevertheless, in the planned experiment to study hassocene (Hs(C5H5)2), ferrocene may also be used for comparison along with ruthenocene and osmocene.|$|E
5|$|After it is dissolved, <b>osmium</b> is {{separated}} from the other platinum group metals by distillation or extraction with organic solvents of the volatile <b>osmium</b> tetroxide. The first method {{is similar to the}} procedure used by Tennant and Wollaston. Both methods are suitable for industrial scale production. In either case, the product is reduced using hydrogen, yielding the metal as a powder or sponge that can be treated using powder metallurgy techniques.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 an Austrian chemist Auer von Welsbach {{developed}} the Oslamp with a filament made of <b>osmium,</b> which he introduced commercially in 1902. After {{only a few}} years, <b>osmium</b> {{was replaced by the}} more stable metal tungsten. Tungsten has the highest melting point among all metals, and its use in light bulbs increases the luminous efficacy and life of incandescent lamps.|$|E
5|$|Iron is {{the first}} of the {{transition}} metals that cannot reach its group oxidation state of +8, although its heavier congeners ruthenium and <b>osmium</b> can, with ruthenium having more difficulty than <b>osmium.</b> Ruthenium exhibits an aqueous cationic chemistry in its low oxidation states similar to that of iron, but <b>osmium</b> does not, favoring high oxidation states in which it forms anionic complexes. In fact, in this second half of the 3d transition series, vertical similarities down the groups compete with the horizontal similarities of iron with its neighbors cobalt and nickel in the periodic table, which are also ferromagnetic at room temperature and share similar chemistry. As such, iron, cobalt, and nickel are sometimes grouped together as the iron triad.|$|E
5|$|Neither the {{producers}} nor the United States Geological Survey published any production amounts for <b>osmium.</b> Estimations of the United States consumption date published from 1971, which gives a {{consumption in the}} United States of 2000troy ounces (62kg), {{would suggest that the}} production is still less than 1ton per year. In 2012, the estimated US production of <b>osmium</b> was 75kg.|$|E
5|$|Nowadays <b>osmium</b> is {{obtained}} {{primarily from the}} processing of platinum and nickel ores.|$|E
5|$|<b>Osmium</b> was {{discovered}} in 1803 by Smithson Tennant and William Hyde Wollaston in London, England. The discovery of <b>osmium</b> is intertwined with that of platinum and the other metals of the platinum group. Platinum reached Europe as platina ("small silver"), first encountered in the late 17th century in silver mines around the Chocó Department, in Colombia. The discovery that this metal was not an alloy, but a distinct new element, was published in 1748.|$|E
5|$|The {{measured}} {{density of}} iridium {{is only slightly}} lower (by about 0.12%) than that of <b>osmium,</b> the densest element known. Some ambiguity occurred regarding {{which of the two}} elements was denser, due to the small size of the difference in density and difficulties in measuring it accurately, but, with increased accuracy in factors used for calculating density X-ray crystallographic data yielded densities of 22.56g/cm3 for iridium and 22.59g/cm3 for <b>osmium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Uranium and <b>osmium</b> were early {{successful}} catalysts in the Haber process, {{the nitrogen}} fixation reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia, giving enough yield {{to make the}} process economically successful. At the time, a group at BASF led by Carl Bosch bought most of the world's supply of <b>osmium</b> {{to use as a}} catalyst. Shortly thereafter, in 1908, cheaper catalysts based on iron and iron oxides were introduced by the same group for the first pilot plants, removing the need for the expensive and rare <b>osmium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its broad}} range of {{compounds}} in numerous oxidation states, <b>osmium</b> in bulk form at ordinary temperatures and pressures resists attack by all acids and alkalis, including aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|The Fringe team {{is called}} {{to the scene of}} a robbery of a metal depository; the body of one of the thieves, shot by a {{security}} guard, inexplicably floats off the ground, while a second culprit has gotten away. They find that the thief has taken off with a supply of <b>osmium,</b> one of the densest elements, and an autopsy later reveals that the dead thief's body is filled with the metal. Tracking a security card on the body, they enter a warehouse where they find the second culprit, dead, along with the bodies of several more people, all of them paraplegic. Walter (John Noble) notes that the physical properties of <b>osmium</b> (both gravitational and thermal) have been reversed, and by melting the <b>osmium</b> collected from the first victim using liquid nitrogen, they detect the presence of the rarer element lutetium, typically only present in meteorites.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} {{members of}} group 8 have relatively high melting points (Fe, 1538°C; Ru, 2334°C; Os, 3033°C). Much like them, hassium {{is predicted to}} be a solid at room temperature, although the melting point of hassium has not been precisely calculated. Hassium should crystallize in the hexagonal close-packed structure (c/a=1.59), similarly to its lighter congener <b>osmium.</b> Pure metallic hassium is calculated to have a bulk modulus (resistance to uniform compression) {{comparable to that of}} diamond (442GPa). Hassium is expected to have a bulk density of 40.7g/cm3, the highest of any of the 118 known elements and nearly twice the density of <b>osmium,</b> the most dense measured element, at 22.61g/cm3. This results from hassium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough hassium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. <b>Osmium</b> is the densest element of the first 6 periods, and its heavier congener hassium {{is expected to be the}} densest element of the first 7 periods.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Soviet {{scientist}} Victor Cherdyntsev, who {{had previously}} claimed the existence of primordial curium-247, claimed to have discovered element 108 (specifically, the 267Hs isotope, which supposedly had a half-life of 400 to 500million years) in natural molybdenite and suggested the name sergenium (symbol Sg; at the time, this symbol {{had not yet been}} taken by seaborgium) for it, after the ancient city of Serik along the Silk Road in Kazakhstan where his molybdenite samples came from. His rationale for claiming that sergenium was the heavier homologue to <b>osmium</b> was that minerals supposedly containing sergenium formed volatile oxides when boiled in nitric acid, similarly to <b>osmium.</b> His findings were criticized by V. M. Kulakov on the grounds that some of the properties Cherdyntsev claimed sergenium had were inconsistent with the then-current nuclear physics.|$|E
5|$|<b>Osmium</b> {{is usually}} {{sold as a}} minimum 99.9% pure powder. Like other {{precious}} metals, it is measured by troy weight and by grams. Its price in 2012 was about $400 per troy ounce (or about $13,000 per kilogram), depending on the quantity and its supplier.|$|E
5|$|The {{light bulb}} {{manufacturer}} Osram (founded in 1906, when three German companies, Auer-Gesellschaft, AEG and Siemens & Halske, combined their lamp production facilities) derived {{its name from}} the elements of <b>osmium</b> and Wolfram (the latter is German for tungsten).|$|E
5|$|The {{oxidation}} {{states of}} ruthenium range from 0 to +8, and −2. The properties of ruthenium and <b>osmium</b> compounds are often similar. The +2, +3, and +4 states {{are the most}} common. The most prevalent precursor is ruthenium trichloride, a red solid that is poorly defined chemically but versatile synthetically.|$|E
5|$|Various {{calculations}} {{show that}} hassium {{should be the}} heaviest known group 8 element, consistent with the periodic law. Its properties should generally match those expected for a heavier homologue of <b>osmium,</b> with a few deviations arising from relativistic effects.|$|E
5|$|Within Earth's crust, <b>osmium,</b> like iridium, {{is found}} at highest {{concentrations}} in {{three types of}} geologic structure: igneous deposits (crustal intrusions from below), impact craters, and deposits reworked {{from one of the}} former structures. The largest known primary reserves are in the Bushveld Igneous Complex in South Africa, though the large copper–nickel deposits near Norilsk in Russia, and the Sudbury Basin in Canada are also significant sources of <b>osmium.</b> Smaller reserves {{can be found in the}} United States. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum group metals. The second large alluvial deposit was found in the Ural Mountains, Russia, which is still mined.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Scottish {{toxicologist}} John Duffus {{reviewed the}} definitions used {{over the previous}} 60 years and concluded they were so diverse as to effectively render the term meaningless. Along with this finding, the heavy metal status of some metals is occasionally challenged {{on the grounds that}} they are too light, or are involved in biological processes, or rarely constitute environmental hazards. Examples include scandium (too light); vanadium to zinc (biological processes); and rhodium, indium, and <b>osmium</b> (too rare).|$|E
5|$|Iridium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ir and atomic number 77. A very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group, iridium is generally credited {{with being the}} second densest element (after <b>osmium).</b> It {{is also the most}} corrosion-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000°C. Although only certain molten salts and halogens are corrosive to solid iridium, finely divided iridium dust is much more reactive and can be flammable.|$|E
5|$|Rhenium is a silvery-white metal {{with one}} of the highest melting points of all elements, {{exceeded}} by only tungsten and carbon. It also {{has one of the highest}} boiling points of all elements. It is also one of the densest, exceeded only by platinum, iridium and <b>osmium.</b> Rhenium has a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure, with lattice parameters a=276.1pm and c=445.6pm.|$|E
5|$|Roughly 12 tonnes of {{ruthenium}} are mined {{each year}} with world reserves estimated as 5,000 tonnes. The {{composition of the}} mined platinum group metal (PGM) mixtures varies widely, depending on the geochemical formation. For example, the PGMs mined in South Africa contain on average 11% ruthenium while the PGMs mined in the former USSR contain only 2% (1992). Ruthenium, <b>osmium,</b> and iridium are considered the minor platinum group metals.|$|E
5|$|Bohrium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.62), similar to its lighter congener rhenium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 37.1g/cm3, which would be the third-highest of any of the 118 known elements, lower than only meitnerium (37.4g/cm3) and hassium (41g/cm3), the two following elements in the periodic table. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, <b>osmium,</b> has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from bohrium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough bohrium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|Chabaneau {{was able}} to easily remove most of platinum's natural impurities, {{including}} gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron, leading him {{to believe that he}} was working with pure platinum. However, the metal displayed inconsistent characteristics. At times it was malleable, yet at times it was highly brittle. Sometimes it was entirely incombustible, yet sometimes it burned readily. These inconsistencies were a result of various impurities: rhodium, palladium, <b>osmium,</b> iridium, and ruthenium. These elements would later {{come to be known as}} the platinum group metals, but at the time of Chabaneau's research, they had not yet been discovered.|$|E
5|$|Darmstadtium is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and to crystallize in the body-centered cubic structure, unlike its lighter congeners which crystallize in the face-centered cubic structure, because it {{is expected}} to have different electron charge densities from them. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 34.8g/cm3. In comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, <b>osmium,</b> has a density of only 22.61g/cm3. This results from darmstadtium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough darmstadtium to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, it was {{hypothesized}} that an isomer of 271Hs might have a half-life of around (2.5±0.5)×108y, which would explain the observation of alpha particles with energies of around 4.4MeV in some samples of molybdenite and osmiridium. This isomer of 271Hs could be produced from the beta decay of 271Bh and 271Sg, which, being homologous to rhenium and molybdenum respectively, should occur in molybdenite along with rhenium and molybdenum if they occurred in nature. Since hassium is homologous to <b>osmium,</b> it should also occur along with <b>osmium</b> in osmiridium if it occurred in nature. The decay chains of 271Bh and 271Sg are very hypothetical and the predicted half-life of this hypothetical hassium isomer is not long enough for any sufficient quantity to remain on Earth. It is possible that more 271Hs may be deposited on the Earth as the Solar System travels through the spiral arms of the Milky Way, which would also explain excesses of plutonium-239 found on the floors of the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Finland, but minerals enriched with 271Hs are predicted to also have excesses of uranium-235 and lead-207, and would have different proportions of elements that are formed during spontaneous fission, such as krypton, zirconium, and xenon. Thus, the occurrence of hassium in nature in minerals such as molybdenite and osmiride is theoretically possible, but highly unlikely.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, it is a d-block transactinide element. Hassium {{is a member of}} the 7th period and belongs to the group 8 elements: it is thus the sixth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that hassium behaves as the heavier homologue to <b>osmium</b> in group 8. The chemical properties of hassium are characterized only partly, but they compare well with the chemistry of the other group 8 elements. In bulk quantities, hassium is expected to be a silvery metal that reacts readily with oxygen in the air, forming a volatile tetroxide.|$|E
