40|$|SummaryMost tubes have seams (intercellular or autocellular {{junctions}} that seal membranes {{together into}} a tube), but “seamless” tubes also exist [1 – 3]. In Drosophila, stellate-shaped tracheal terminal cells make <b>seamless</b> <b>tubes,</b> with single branches running through each of dozens of cellular extensions. We find that mutations in braided impair terminal cell branching and cause formation of <b>seamless</b> <b>tube</b> cysts. We show that braided encodes Syntaxin 7 and that cysts also form in cells deficient for other genes required either for membrane scission (shibire) or for early endosome formation (Rab 5, Vps 45, and Rabenosyn- 5). These data define a requirement for early endocytosis in shaping <b>seamless</b> <b>tube</b> lumens. Importantly, apical proteins Crumbs and phospho-Moesin accumulate to aberrantly high levels in braided terminal cells. Overexpression of either Crumbs or phosphomimetic Moesin induced lumenal cysts and decreased terminal branching. Conversely, the braided <b>seamless</b> <b>tube</b> cyst phenotype was suppressed by mutations in crumbs or Moesin. Indeed, mutations in Moesin dominantly suppressed <b>seamless</b> <b>tube</b> cyst formation and restored terminal branching. We propose that early endocytosis maintains normal steady-state levels of Crumbs, which recruits apical phosphorylated (active) Moe, which in turn regulates <b>seamless</b> <b>tube</b> shape through modulation of cortical actin filaments...|$|R

As the first process of <b>seamless</b> <b>tube,</b> piercing is vital {{for the quality of}} the tube. The solid round billet will be transformed into a hollow shell after the piercing process.

But the piercing process is very complicated, and a mechanism model is difficult to build between the qualities of the hollow shell and measurement variables. Furthermore, an intelligent model is needed. We established two piercing process monitoring and fault diagnosis models based on the multiway principal component analysis (MPCA) model and the multistage MPCA model, respectively, and furthermore we made a comparison between these two concepts. We took three ways to divide the period based on process, K-means, and GA, respectively.

To determine the mechanisms that induce branching of WT stalk cells we mapped the mutations. We found that okg and cnj encode two vATPase subunits and dsj encodes an Archease. Terminal cells deficient for vATPase activity mis-localize apical proteins and stall apical membrane growth, which stimulates compensatory stalk cell hypertrophy and branching. While dsj, okg and cnj terminal cells shared terminal cell pruning defects were genetically downstream of the Target of Rapamycin (Tor) pathway, the compensatory branching of WT stalk cells adjacent to dsj terminal cell was independent of apical polarity. Additionally, we found that terminal cell injury induced adjacent stalk cell compensatory branching and stalk cells next to injured and genetically compromised terminal cells activate Jun Kinase and endoreplicate during invasion. Finally, inactivation of the Hippo growth pathway in stalk cells is sufficient to induce hypertrophy and branching. We conclude that genetically compromised or injured terminal cells activate hypertrophy and branching in a neighboring stalk cell. ...|$|R

In the light of such a review and a case study, the process planning problem is formulated in the domain of <b>seamless</b> <b>tube</b> manufacture, its basic sub-tasks are identified and capabilities and constraints of the available equipment in the specific plant are established. The task of collecting and collating the process planning knowledge in <b>seamless</b> <b>tube</b> manufacture is discussed and is mostly fulfilled from domain experts, analysing of existing manufacturing records specific to plant, textbooks and applicable Standards. For the cold drawing mill, tube-drawing schedules have been rationalised to correspond with practice.
