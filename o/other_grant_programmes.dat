40|$|Several {{reviews and}} impact {{assessment}} studies {{have concluded that}} the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP 6) succeeded in fostering scientific excellence and attracting the “A Team” in public science. However, these studies typically fail to contrast their findings with the variety of funding opportunities available to public science. Based on a sample of more than 1, 000 scientists at universities and public research institutes in Germany, this paper finds that highly credentialed faculty typically chose other funding opportunities than FP 6, for example grants from science foundations or industry. In fact, FP 6 only seems to be attractive for the scientific “B Team” that works rather application oriented. The findings further indicate that an FP 6 participation substitutes for <b>other</b> <b>grant</b> <b>programmes</b> while the latter are complementary to each other. If this is intended to be changed other funding priorities will be required, for example smaller team sizes, less predefined research topics, a reduced administrative burden, and a higher quality of the peer review system...|$|E

40|$|The {{creation}} of local inter-sector partnerships (the so called Local Action Groups) of the Czech Republic {{which are based}} on the LEADER principle was instigated by the activity of other member states of the EU. Since 2004 European and mainly Czech grant policy has been supporting the possible formation of partnerships among the non-profit, private and public sphere in the Czech Republic and its formalization into organizations with relevant legal personality. After several challenges of the "LEADER ČR" and "LEADER +" programmes in the years 2004 [...] 2006, there are about 150 Czech functional LAGs (which are called 'MAS' in Czech) which can participate in the LEADER 2007 [...] 2013 programme, i. e. in the last planned European grant programme for LAGs in the Czech Republic. If they do not succeed with their requests in the two planned LEADER challenges, future existence of these unsuccessful organizations will be questionable. The aim of my diploma thesis is to explain the developing situation of LAGs in the Czech Republic, to state the possibilities of operating and drawing the sources for financing the LAGs outside the Programme for Rural Development [...] Axis IV. LEADER, and financing from <b>other</b> <b>grant</b> <b>programmes</b> which are available for LAGs.

40|$|Masters in Public Administration - MPAYouth {{today are}} {{constantly}} faced with enormous challenges and are continually faced with job uncertainty and scarce opportunities {{with almost no}} means to personal growth. Faced with bleak future livelihood prospects, youth make up {{a large number of}} the world’s working poor. Inadequate youth education and lack of labour market preparation still pose challenges for South African youth. They face sizeable constraints to entrepreneurship such as a lack of entrepreneurship culture; lack of entrepreneurship knowledge through formal and informal education; relevant business development services, unsatisfactory business support and insufficient access to financing. Despite this, the extent of research on youth entrepreneurship in Africa is deficient, even non-existent in some contexts. In response to the alarming rate of youth unemployment, the South African government had embarked on realising some of the aspects of the National Youth Policy through youth empowerment via a number of interventions. The implementing agency of all youth development policies and interventions is the National Youth Development Agency (NYDA). The agency has rolled out a number of interventions to address various issues pertinent to the state of the youth in South Africa. However, the specific interventions this study addresses are those related to entrepreneurship, specifically the NYDA <b>Grant</b> <b>programme.</b> Under the <b>Grant</b> <b>programme,</b> a number of issues are addressed such as provision of physical capital, access to resources in the form of advice, guidance and mentorship made available by the National Youth Development Agency to the unemployed youth in the Western Cape. While many youth development programmes have been rolled out both around the world and in South Africa, very little monitoring and evaluation has been conducted in identifying which programmes are effective and sustainable in the long run. At the time of this research, limited information had been accessible with respect to the benefits of entrepreneurship development programmes in South Africa. This research is significant {{in the sense that it}} bridges the gaps in the literature on youth entrepreneurship interventions and practical interventions in the field. Furthermore, it provides a lens with which to determine whether they are indeed a sustainable way forward for unemployed youth. Therefore this study conducted a process evaluation using qualitative research methods in order to ascertain if the NYDA is efficiently and effectively executing its mandate with respect to the <b>Grant</b> <b>programme.</b> The research objectives of this study were 1) to conduct a process evaluation of the National Youth Development Agency’s <b>Grant</b> <b>programme,</b> 2) to develop a theoretical and legislative framework underpinning youth in South Africa, 3) to describe and analyse the NYDA’s <b>Grant</b> <b>programme,</b> 4) to highlight the opportunities and challenges that affect the current implementation of the <b>Grant</b> <b>programme</b> and 5) to present recommendations. The findings suggest that the <b>Grant</b> <b>programme</b> has been relevant, timely and useful to young aspiring entrepreneurs providing them with the necessary support through the provision of stock, physical capital and other business support services such as mandatory entrepreneurial training. Despite this, young entrepreneurs still face challenges in sustaining their businesses financially and struggle with establishing a physical space in which they can trade. A number of recommendations were made from the perspectives of the beneficiaries and the NYDA Cape Town Branch implementing staff, namely: increasing staff to improve the administration of the <b>Grant</b> <b>Programme,</b> increasing the <b>grant</b> turnaround time, providing recourse to further funding and physical space and uploading the grant application process onto the internet to save time and money for both beneficiaries and implementing staff...|$|R
40|$|The Tackling FGM Initiative (TFGMI) {{has been}} working since 2010 to {{strengthen}} the prevention of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) at community level. There were two phases of the TFGMI – Phase One from 2010 - 2013, and Phase Two from 2013 - 2016. Over the course of both phases, 51 organisations were funded {{with a total of}} £ 2. 8 million invested. This evaluation report focuses on results achieved in Phase Two. Phase One of the Initiative produced a clearer understanding of 'what works' for community-based prevention of FGM in the UK context. This included working with women affected by FGM as 'community champions' to amplify the voice of survivors and people from affected communities, religious leaders and young people, and raising awareness of the health, and other harms of FGM, as well as the UK law. Gaps identified at the end of Phase One included the need to: strengthen rights-based approaches to ending FGM; further access isolated communities; enhance comprehensive responses to FGM by strengthening relationships with statutory agencies. In addition, within the TFGMI a small <b>grants</b> <b>programme</b> was initiated with funding from Comic Relief. This aimed to widen the impact of the TFGMI into further geographic areas, building on what had been learnt under Phase One. Overview of Programme Aims and Objectives: Both the Tackling FGM Initiative small and large <b>grants</b> <b>programmes</b> aimed to achieve the overall aims which were; -  To strengthen community-based preventive work {{to protect the rights of}} women and children - To reduce the risk to girls and young women in the UK of under-going genital mutilation in all its forms The objectives of the TFGMI Large <b>Grants</b> <b>Programme</b> for Phase Two were: 1. To strengthen work which promotes a rights-based approach to tackling FGM among affected communities. 2. To undertake awareness-raising work with target audiences using the most effective messages for that group. 3. To reach those who are most resistant to work which tackles FGM or those who don't normally access services or engage in community activities. 4. To increase the skills and capacities within affected communities to speak out against FGM. 5. To strengthen the capacity of community groups to engage with statutory agencies so that prevention of FGM among women and girls at risk in the UK is mainstreamed as a form of child abuse and violence against women. 6. To strengthen the network of groups active in tackling FGM and work with policy-makers and partners locally contributing to a broader campaign to end FGM in the UK. The small <b>grants</b> <b>programme</b> had an additional four objectives, but these were subsumed into large grant objectives due to their similarities: -  Activist groups become more confident, more knowledgeable, and more skilled in championing issues within their communities (Objective 4 of the large <b>grants</b> <b>programme).</b> - Grassroots organisations and activist groups become more skilled in engaging with, and in lobbying the range of relevant statutory bodies for appropriate responses to the issue (Objective 5 of the large <b>grants</b> <b>programme).</b> - A more cohesive, more unified movement that embraces a range of stakeholders (small and larger groups) sharing learning and good practice in addressing this issue. (Objective 6 of the large <b>grants</b> <b>programme).</b> 1. In addition, a specific aim of the small <b>grants</b> <b>programme</b> was to "reach more communities in more geographical areas and that more sections of these communities are reached, increasing the movement to stamp out FGM in the UK. ...|$|R
