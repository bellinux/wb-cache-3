40|$|Hybrid light {{emitting}} diodes (LEDs) based on n-ZnO nanorods and blended polymers were fabricated and characterized. The blended polymers consisted of a blue emitting polymer and a charge transport polymer. The effect of the interlayer design on the electrical and electroluminescent characteristics of these hybrid LEDs was investigated. We demonstrated that by adding a calcium (2) acetylacetonate [Ca(acac) (2) ] layer between the blended polymer layer and the ZnO nanorods, an increase in device performance was observed. The purpose of the extra layer was {{to act as a}} band <b>offset</b> <b>stepping</b> layer (<b>offset</b> divider). Moreover, the effect of the stepper layer thickness for this <b>offset</b> <b>stepping</b> layer was studied.

Some researchers assert many benefits from increasing CAFE, from less dependence on imported petroleum to lower urban ozone.

Higher CAFE reduces safety, unless <b>offsetting</b> <b>steps</b> are taken. Should the public demand moderately higher fuel efficiency, the government should raise the CAFE standard and gasoline prices.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{genetic and}} {{molecular}} basis of glutamatergic dysfunction is {{one key to}} understand schizophrenia, with the identification of an intermediate phenotype being an essential <b>step.</b> <b>Mismatch</b> negativity (MMN) or its magnetic counterpart, magnetic mismatch field (MMF) is an index of preattentive change detection processes in the auditory cortex and is generated through glutamatergic neurotransmission. We have previously shown that MMN/MMF in response to phoneme change is markedly reduced in schizophrenia. Variations in metabotropic glutamate receptor (GRM 3) {{may be associated with}} schizophrenia, and has been shown to affect cortical function. Here we investigated the effect of GRM 3 genotypes on phonetic MMF in healthy men. METHODS: MMF in response to phoneme change was recorded using magnetoencephalography in 41 right-handed healthy Japanese men. Based on previous genetic association studies in schizophrenia, 4 candidate SNPs (rs 6465084, rs 2299225, rs 1468412, rs 274622) were genotyped. RESULTS: GRM 3 rs 274622 genotype variations significantly predicted MMF strengths (p =  0. 009), with C carriers exhibiting significantly larger MMF strengths in both hemispheres compared to the TT subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that variations in GRM 3 genotype modulate the auditory cortical response to phoneme change in humans. MMN/MMF, particularly those in response to speech sounds, may be a promising and sensitive intermediate phenotype for clarifying glutamatergic dysfunction in schizophrenia...|$|R

40|$|The goal of many early visual {{filtering}} processes is {{to remove}} noise {{while at the same}} time sharpening contrast. An historical succession of approaches to this problem, starting with the use of simple derivative and smoothing operators, and the subsequent realization of the relationship between scale-space and the isotropic dfffusion equation, has recently resulted in the development of "geometry-driven" dfffusion. Nonlinear and anisotropic diffusion methods, as well as image-driven nonlinear filtering, have provided improved performance relative to the older isotropic and linear diffusion techniques. These techniques, which either explicitly or implicitly make use of kernels whose shape and center are functions of local image structure are too computationally expensive for use in real-time vision applications. In this paper, we show that results which are largely equivalent to those obtained from geometry-driven diffusion can be achieved by a process which is conceptually separated info two very different functions. The first involves the construction of a vector~field of "offsets", defined on a subset of the original image, at which to apply a filter. The offsets are used to displace filters away from boundaries to prevent edge blurring and destruction. The second is the (straightforward) application of the filter itself. The former function is a kind generalized image skeletonization; the latter is conventional image filtering. This formulation leads to results which are qualitatively similar to contemporary nonlinear diffusion methods, but at computation times that are roughly two orders of magnitude faster; allowing applications of this technique to real-time imaging. An additional advantage of this formulation is that it allows existing filter hardware and software implementations to be applied with no modification, since the <b>offset</b> <b>step</b> reduces to an image pixel permutation, or look-up table operation, after application of the filter...|$|R

Here we report that Mycobacterium smegmatis NucS/EndoMS, a putative endonuclease with no structural homology to known MMR factors, is required for mutation avoidance and anti-recombination, hallmarks of the canonical MMR. Furthermore, phenotypic analysis of naturally occurring polymorphic NucS in a M. smegmatis surrogate model, suggests the existence of M. tuberculosis mutator strains.

Although MutL alone has no effect on M 13 -fd heteroduplex formation, the protein dramatically enhances the inhibition of strand transfer mediated by MutS.
