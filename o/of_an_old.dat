5|$|Ambassador Soval is summoned before Administrator V'Las and the High Council to face {{punishment}} {{over his}} use of a mind meld. Since the act is widely considered to be criminal by the Vulcan authorities, Soval is summarily dismissed from the Ambassadorial service. Meanwhile, Captain Archer and Commander T'Pol are questioned by the Syrrannites. After a short while, T'Pol is taken to see her mother, T'Les, and the two disagree about the tenets of the group — the Vulcan authorities call them extremists, a term T'Les disagrees with. Soon, Archer begins to see visions <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> Vulcan, and the dissidents determine {{that he had the}} katra of Surak transferred into him via mind meld.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and birds}} {{associated}} with C.australis include lizards which forage among the flowers, including the gold-striped gecko which is well camouflaged for life among {{the leaves of}} the tree. New Zealand bellbirds like to nest under the dead leaves or among the flower stalks, and paradise shelducks commonly build their nests in the base <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> cabbage tree {{standing in the middle of}} a field. Red-crowned parakeets are often seen foraging in cabbage trees. In South Canterbury, long-tailed bats shelter during the day in the hollow branches, which would once have provided nesting holes for many birds.|$|E

He was buried in Ovingham churchyard, beside his wife Isabella, who had died two years earlier, and not far from his parents and his brother John.|$|E
