25|$|The {{price of}} an MBS pool is also {{influenced}} by the loan balance. Common specifications for MBS pools are loan amount ranges that each mortgage in the pool must pass. Typically, high-premium (high-coupon) MBSs backed by mortgages with an <b>original</b> <b>loan</b> <b>balance</b> no larger than $85,000 command the largest pay-ups. Even though the borrower is paying an above market yield, {{he or she is}} dissuaded from refinancing a small loan balance due to the high fixed cost involved.|$|E
50|$|P0 is {{the same}} as P(0) - the <b>original</b> <b>loan</b> amount or <b>loan</b> <b>balance</b> at time t = 0.|$|R
50|$|Negative {{amortization}} (also called deferred interest) occurs if {{the payments}} made do not cover the interest due. The remaining interest owed {{is added to}} the outstanding <b>loan</b> <b>balance,</b> making it larger than the <b>original</b> <b>loan</b> amount.|$|R
50|$|Commercial {{mortgages}} frequently amortize {{over the}} term of the loan, meaning the borrower pays both interest and principal over time, and the <b>loan</b> <b>balance</b> {{at the end of}} the term is less than the <b>original</b> <b>loan</b> amount. However, unlike residential mortgages, commercial mortgages generally do not fully amortize over the stated term, and therefore frequently end with a balloon payment of the remaining balance, which is often repaid by refinancing the property. Some commercial mortgages have an interest-only period at the beginning of the loan term during which time the borrower only pays interest.|$|R
5000|$|Neg-Ams {{also have}} {{what is called}} a recast period, and the recast {{principal}} balance cap is in the U.S. based on Federal and State legislation. The recast period is usually 60 months (5 years). The recast principal balance cap (also known as the [...] "neg am limit") is usually up to a 25% increase of the amortized <b>loan</b> <b>balance</b> over the <b>original</b> <b>loan</b> amount. States and lenders can offer products with lesser recast periods and principal balance caps; but cannot issue loans that exceed their state and federal legislated requirements under penalty of law.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose a}} real option {{framework}} to value distressed properties and restructure their loans. Our approach reconciles {{the interests of}} borrowers and lenders through a constrained optimiza-tion model yielding mutually beneficial restructure terms. Borrowers receive lower <b>loan</b> <b>balances</b> and payments, while lenders replace non-performing loans with performing loans that have high-er market values. A numerical illustration shows that {{the market value of}} a restructured loan can exceed that of the <b>original</b> non-performing <b>loan</b> and the post-foreclosure cash flows when the lender repossesses the property...|$|R
2500|$|For example, a $200,000 ARM with a 110% [...] "neg am" [...] cap will {{typically}} {{adjust to}} a fully amortizing payment, based on the current fully indexed interest rate and the remaining term of the loan, if negative amortization causes the <b>loan</b> <b>balance</b> to exceed $220,000. For a 125% recast, this will happen if the <b>loan</b> <b>balance</b> reaches $250,000.|$|R
5000|$|Next, {{in order}} to find the {{outstanding}} <b>loan</b> <b>balance</b> you will need to find the present value of the remaining payments. Use the monthly payment of $775.30 as the payment function, the term will be 156 ((20-7)x12), and [...]583333% as the rate. This will give you an outstanding <b>loan</b> <b>balance</b> of $79,268.02. Again, the present value of an annuity formula should be used.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{ongoing costs}} that may {{apply to a}} reverse {{mortgage}}: annual mortgage insurance and servicing fees. Like IMIP, annual mortgage insurance is charged by FHA to insure the loan and accrues annually {{at a rate of}} 1.25% of the <b>loan</b> <b>balance.</b> Annual mortgage insurance {{does not need to be}} paid out of pocket by the borrower; it can be allowed to accrue onto the <b>loan</b> <b>balance</b> over time.|$|R

5000|$|Premium {{financing}} arrangements were under intense scrutiny. In-force financed policies are being called for collateral in large numbers. Clients who are [...] "underwater," [...] where the <b>loan</b> <b>balance</b> exceeds the policy cash value, {{are being forced}} to post additional collateral at low risk-weighted rates and/or surrender the policies and pay the outstanding <b>loan</b> <b>balance</b> out of pocket. Additionally, several carriers who were active in the financing marketplace have been downgraded, causing large-scale exchanges or surrenders from in-force policies.|$|R
50|$|Complementary loan {{insurance}} relieves outstanding <b>loan</b> <b>balances</b> to a borrower's {{family when}} the borrower cannot work due to extreme illness, injury, or death.|$|R
50|$|A reverse {{mortgage}} {{is a type}} of home loan for older homeowners that requires no monthly mortgage payments. Borrowers are still responsible for property taxes and homeowner's insurance. Reverse mortgages allow elders to access the home equity they have built up in their homes now, and defer payment of the loan until they die, sell, or move out of the home. Because there are no required mortgage payments on a {{reverse mortgage}}, the interest is added to the <b>loan</b> <b>balance</b> each month. The rising <b>loan</b> <b>balance</b> can eventually grow to exceed the value of the home, particularly in times of declining home values or if the borrower continues to live in the home for many years. However, the borrower (or the borrower's estate) is generally not required to repay any additional <b>loan</b> <b>balance</b> in excess {{of the value of the}} home.|$|R
