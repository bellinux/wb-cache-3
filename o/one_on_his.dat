In so doing, he avoided a reference to Marianne, who invariably wears a pileus. The seven rays form a halo or aureole. They evoke the sun, the seven seas, and the seven continents, and represent another means, besides the torch, whereby Liberty enlightens the world.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the project}} had neither a budget nor a script. On the former issue, Universal head Lew Wasserman thought the film {{could be made}} for $12 million; the filmmakers wanted $20 million. It would be {{impossible}} to settle on a specific amount without a screenplay to review, and after Mitch Glazer declined to help him, Aykroyd wrote <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> own.|$|E
5|$|Planescape: Torment is {{primarily}} story-driven and combat is not prominently featured.

5|$|Although Emerson {{credits his}} grandfather's {{gift of a}} Barlow knife {{to him at the}} age of eight years with {{starting}} his interest in knives, it was not until later in life that he turned to making them. The summer of 1978 found Emerson in need of a balisong knife for his study of a Filipino martial art and, unable to afford <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> salary, Emerson decided he would attempt to make his own instead. He milled and drilled the handles from aluminum stock; the knife's blade was a simple steel blank that he hand cut with a hacksaw, shaped with files, and heat treated at his dining room table with a butane torch.|$|E
5|$|Desiring {{to return}} to the U.S. but still fearing capture, Breckinridge moved his family back to Niagara in June 1868. Within sight of the U.S. border, he steadfastly refused to seek a pardon, {{although}} 70 members of the Kentucky General Assembly had requested <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> behalf from President Andrew Johnson on February 10, 1866. On January 8, 1868, the Louisville City Council instructed the state's congressional delegation to seek assurance that Breckinridge would not be prosecuted on his return. James Beck, Breckinridge's old law partner, was then in Congress and wrote to him on December 11, 1868, that it appeared likely that Johnson would issue a general pardon for all former Confederates; he advised Breckinridge {{to return to}} the U.S. prior to the pardon being issued because he feared it might only apply to those in the country.|$|E
5|$|Glenn was {{a backup}} pilot for Shepard and Grissom {{on the first}} two manned Project Mercury flights, Mercury-Redstone 3 and Mercury-Redstone 4 sub-orbital missions. Glenn was {{selected}} for Mercury-Atlas 6, NASA's first manned orbital flight, with Carpenter as his backup. Putting a man in orbit would achieve one of Project Mercury's most important goals. Shepard and Grissom had named their spacecraft Freedom 7 and Liberty Bell 7. The numeral 7 had originally been the production number of Shepard's spacecraft, but had come to represent the Mercury 7. Glenn named his spacecraft, number 13, Friendship 7, and had the name hand-painted on the side like the <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> F-86 had been. Glenn and Carpenter completed their training for the mission in January 1962, but postponement of the launch allowed them to continue rehearsing. Glenn spent 25 hours and 25 minutes in the spacecraft performing hanger and altitude test, and 59 hours and 45 minutes in the simulator. He flew 70 simulated missions and reacted to 189 simulated system failures.|$|E

25|$|Result: Odyssey {{got off to}} {{a strong}} start, as team leader Patrick had a lot of {{experience}} in the fashion industry. However, as he was the only <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> team to know anything about it, he had {{to spend a lot of}} time telling the others what could sell, which left less time for him to lead the team. Patrick also designed a kimono/wetsuit, which drew customers to the stall, but failed to sell. Halfway through the day, Patrick made the decision to leave the shopping centre they were selling at to try their luck selling to retailers. They had little success doing this however, and had to resort to selling all their customized stock to one retailer for £40, losing nearly £100 on the cost of creating them. On the girls' team, Ashleigh led from the front and made firm decisions, but the clothes they chose did not sell as well as on the boys' team. Nonetheless, the sub-team at the shopping centre managed to attract many customers, and eventually the team made a profit of £453.36, while Odyssey made a profit of £330.37.|$|E
25|$|Qualifying {{took place}} from early Sunday {{afternoon}} with four groups of five cars with the fastest five overall participants progressing into super pole. It {{was held in}} dry and warm weather conditions. In {{the first group of}} five cars, López set the fastest lap with Duval close behind in second. On his maximum power lap, Buemi locked his tyres going into the first turn, but despite going quicker in the second sector, could only muster a provisional third-place result. Engel and Carroll were the first group's slowest drivers. Rosenqvist set the pace in the second group and was followed by Vergne. Dillmann and d'Ambrosio took the next two placings with Evans the slowest competitor in the second group after heavily locking his tyres entering the first corner and had to regain control of his car. Piquet set the third group's quickest time, with Sarrazin placed second; the latter locked his brakes driving into turn <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> maximum power lap. Félix da Costa ran deep heading into the first turn and dealt with excessive oversteer throughout his lap, restricting him to third. Frijns, suffering similar problems to his teammate, followed in fourth, and Turvey was the third group's slowest competitor.|$|E

25|$|Safin's next tournament was in Valencia. He {{defeated}} {{former world}} No. 1 and fourth seed Juan Carlos Ferrero. In {{spite of the}} fact that Ferrero is from the Valencia region, Safin was the more popular player, having been based in Valencia for many years and being a well-known Valencia CF fan. – local player Ferrero controversially favouring Real Madrid. He played Dutch teenager Robin Haase in the next round. He won the first set and was up 4–2 in the second set. However, Haase broke back to take it to a tiebreak. Safin had four match points, including <b>one</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> serve, but lost the tiebreak, and eventually the match. In the Monte Carlo Masters, Safin defeated Xavier Malisse, but then lost to No. 5 David Ferrer. He then entered the 2008 BMW Open in Munich, Germany, where he beat Carlos Berlocq in the first round. In the second round, he edged out Michael Berrer, but lost to Fernando González in his first quarterfinal of the year, and the first since June 2007 at the Legg Mason Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C. Safin entered the 2008 French Open but was eliminated in the second round by countryman and fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko, in straight sets.|$|E
