25|$|Congressman Rush Holt, whose {{district}} in New Jersey includes a mailbox from which anthrax letters {{are believed to}} have been mailed, called for an investigation of the anthrax attacks by Congress or by an independent commission he proposed in a bill entitled the Anthrax Attacks Investigation Act (H.R. 1248) Other members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> also called for an independent investigation.|$|E
25|$|Some members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> {{tried to}} create a federal usury statute that would limit the maximum {{allowable}} interest rate, but the measures have not progressed. In July 2010, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, {{was signed into law}} by President Obama. The act provides for a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to regulate some credit practices but has no interest rate limit.|$|E

25|$|Customarily, one {{cabinet member}} (the {{designated}} survivor) does not attend, {{in order to}} provide continuity in the line of succession in the event that a catastrophe disables the President, the Vice President, and other succeeding officers gathered in the House chamber.

25|$|Boxer {{was part}} of a {{coalition}} to increase medical research to find cures for diseases. In 2007, she authored successful bipartisan legislation with Senator Gordon Smith to combat HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis globally. In 1997, she authored a Patients' Bill of Rights. She has written a bill to make health insurance tax-deductible and one to let any American buy into the same health insurance program that members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have.</b> She supports comprehensive prescription drug coverage through Medicare and the right of all consumers to purchase lower-cost prescription drugs re-imported from Canada.|$|E
25|$|Congress {{is split}} into two chambers—House and Senate—and manages the task of writing {{national}} legislation by dividing work into separate committees which specialize in different areas. Some members of Congress are elected by their peers to be officers of these committees. Further, Congress has ancillary {{organizations such as the}} Government Accountability Office and the Library of Congress to help provide it with information, and members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> staff and offices to assist them as well. In addition, a vast industry of lobbyists helps members write legislation on behalf of diverse corporate and labor interests.|$|E

25|$|Since this {{provision}} {{went into effect}} in late 1998, all the Presidents serving in office during this period have determined moving forward with the relocation would be detrimental to U.S. national security concerns and opted to issue waivers suspending any action on this front. A re-assessment has to take place every six months however. In response, members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> begun to include language {{to do away with the}} President's exclusivity in making the determinations or flat-out remove the waiver provision completely from the Embassy Act altogether.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} unfolded {{against the}} backdrop of Clinton's 2016 presidential election campaign and hearings held by the United States House Select Committee on Benghazi. Some experts, officials, and members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> contended that her use of private messaging system software and a private server violated State Department protocols and procedures, as well as federal laws and regulations governing recordkeeping. In response, Clinton has said that her use of personal email was in compliance with federal laws and State Department regulations, and that former secretaries of state had also maintained personal email accounts, though not their own private email servers.|$|E
25|$|Although {{individual}} members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> {{every right to}} express their views and the views of their constituents {{with respect to their}} religious beliefs and principles and their personal standards of who may marry whom, this court cannot conclude that Congress is entitled to solemnize such views in the laws of this nation in disregard of the views, legal status and living arrangements of a significant segment of our citizenry that includes the Debtors in this case. To do so violates the Debtors' right to equal protection of those laws embodied in the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. This court cannot conclude from the evidence or the record in this case that any valid governmental interest is advanced by DOMA as applied to the Debtors.|$|E

25|$|The Senate {{was modeled}} upon the United States Senate; the two {{chambers}} <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> roughly equal powers, and every bill or resolution {{that has to}} go through both houses needs the consent of both chambers before being passed for the president's signature. Once a bill is defeated in the Senate, it is lost. Once a bill is approved by the Senate on third reading, the bill is passed to the House of Representatives, unless an identical bill has also been passed by the lower house. When a counterpart bill in the lower house is different from the one passed by the Senate, either a bicameral conference committee is created consisting of members from both chambers of Congress to reconcile the differences, or either chamber may instead approve the other chamber's version.|$|E
500|$|To prevent ethical conflicts, James Madison {{proposed}} language at the Constitutional Convention {{that was}} adopted as the Ineligibility Clause after debate and modification by other Founding Fathers. Historically, {{a number of}} approaches {{have been taken to}} address the problem posed by restriction; these have included choosing another nominee, allowing the desired nominee's elected term of office to expire, ignoring the clause entirely, or reducing the offending emoluments to the level prior to when the nominee took office. Although Congress passed the mechanism reducing emoluments in 1909, the procedure was named [...] "Saxbe fix" [...] after Senator William Saxbe, who was confirmed as Attorney General in 1973 after Congress reduced the office's salary to the level it had been before Saxbe's term commenced. The Saxbe fix has subsequently become relevant as a successful—though not universally accepted—solution for appointments by presidents of both parties of sitting members of the United States Congress to the United States Cabinet. Members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> been appointed to federal judgeships without any fix being enacted; court challenges to such appointments have failed.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{an article}} in the Washington Post, in 2008 Bachmann may have taken {{advantage}} of a federal program for a home loan, then called for dismantling the program, though the article notes that the public and other members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> taken advantage of such loans despite seeing reasons to criticize them.

2500|$|Former Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi {{has stated}} that the CIA {{repeatedly}} misled Congress since 2001 about waterboarding and other torture, though Pelosi admitted to being told about the programs. Six members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> claimed that Director of the CIA Leon Panetta admitted that {{over a period of}} several years since 2001 the CIA deceived Congress, including affirmatively lying to Congress.

2500|$|Some Republican members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> been {{critical}} of the decision to narrow the scope of the case, including Representatives Frank Wolf of Virginia and Lamar Smith of Texas. Wolf was quoted by the Washington Times as asking, [...] "If showing a weapon, making threatening statements and wearing paramilitary uniforms in front of polling station doors does not constitute voter intimidation, at what threshold of activity would these laws be enforceable?" [...] Smith expressed skepticism at the Obama administration's stated justification for narrowing it, stating [...] "The administration still has failed to explain why it did not pursue an obvious case of voter intimidation. Refusal to address these concerns only confirms politicization of the issue and does not reflect well on the Justice Department." ...|$|E

Members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> identifying lapel pins and {{are not required to}} pass through metal detectors. The officers present failed to recognize McKinney as a member of Congress because she was not wearing the appropriate lapel pin and had recently changed her hairstyle. She proceeded westward down the ground floor hallway and about halfway down the hallway was stopped by United States Capitol Police officer Paul McKenna, who states that he had been calling after her: [...] "Ma'am, Ma'am!"; at that time it is reported that McKinney struck the officer. Two days later, Officer McKenna filed a police report claiming that McKinney had struck [...] "his chest with a closed fist." ...|$|E
2500|$|Carter {{has responded}} to {{negative}} reviews in the mainstream news media in an op-ed published in the Los Angeles Times (which was excerpted in the British newspaper The Guardian and elsewhere): Book reviews {{in the mainstream media}} have been written mostly by representatives of Jewish organizations who would be unlikely to visit the occupied territories, and their primary criticism is that the book is anti-Israel. Two members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> been publicly critical. Incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for instance, issued a statement (before the book was published) saying that [...] "he does not speak for the Democratic Party on Israel." [...] Some reviews posted on Amazon.com call me [...] "anti-Semitic," [...] and others accuse the book of [...] "lies" [...] and [...] "distortions." [...] A former Carter Center fellow has taken issue with it, and Alan Dershowitz called the book's title [...] "indecent." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Wyden {{was one of}} 10 {{senators}} to vote against re-authorization of the Patriot Act. In 2011, with the expiration of the Patriot Act approaching and with efforts to reauthorize the Act once more intensifying, Wyden and fellow Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley sharply criticized the rush to pass the bill. Wyden stated on the Senate floor that [...] "The Patriot Act was passed a decade ago {{during a period of}} understandable fear. Now is the time to revisit this, revisit it and ensure that a better job is done of striking that balance between fighting terror and protecting individual liberty." [...] Wyden and Merkley expressed particular concern with a provision of current law allowing law enforcement authorities to collect [...] "a vast array of business records, emails, phone numbers, [...] even DNA from anyone deemed 'relevant' to an investigation." [...] Wyden offered an amendment to reform the [...] "business-records provision" [...] of the Patriot Act, which he views as being used in an abusive and secret way. In a May 2011 speech in the Senate, Wyden sharply criticized the use of Patriot Act, stating: [...] "The fact is that anyone can read the plain text of the Patriot Act, and yet many members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> no idea how the law is being secretly interpreted by the executive branch, because that interpretation is classified. It's almost as if there were two Patriot Acts, and many members <b>of</b> <b>Congress</b> <b>have</b> not read the one that matters. Our constituents, of course, are totally in the dark. Members of the public have no access to the secret legal interpretations, so they have no idea what their government believes the law actually means." [...] In an interview for the documentary [...] Wyden was asked about legal reviews and the scope of potential assassinations (or [...] "targeted killings") of American citizens by their government, and responded that [...] "the American people would be extraordinarily surprised if they could see the difference between what they believe a law says and how it has actually been interpreted in secret," [...] but that he [...] "is not permitted" [...] to disclose the difference publicly.|$|E
