5|$|Following the {{controversy}} and {{the demolition of}} the Star Ferry Pier in Edinburgh Place in early 2007, activists declared Queen's Pier the next battle-ground against the conservation policy of the Government of Hong Kong. The criticism received over its handling of the Star Ferry Pier caused Michael Suen, the Secretary for Housing, Planning and Lands, to propose a piece-by-piece relocation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> to a new location on the reclaimed waterfront during a Legco session on 21 March 2007. The Government later unveiled four design options for such relocation. The intended closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> was 26 April 2007.|$|E
40|$|In the performance-based seismic bridge design, piers are {{expected}} to undergo large inelastic deformations during severe earthquakes, which in turn can result in large residual drift and concrete crack in <b>the</b> bridge <b>piers.</b> In this paper, longitudinal unbonded prestressing strands are used to minimize residual drift and residual concrete crack width in reinforced concrete (RC) bridge piers. Seven pier specimens were designed and tested quasi-statically and the numerical simulations were carried out. <b>The</b> effectiveness <b>of</b> using vertical unbonded prestressing strands to mitigate the residual drift and concrete crack width of RC bridge piers are examined and discussed in detail. It is found that the residual drift and residual concrete crack width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> can be reduced significantly by using the prestressing strands. Moreover, the strands can increase <b>the</b> lateral strength <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> while have little influence on <b>the</b> ductility capacity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b> <b>The</b> hysteretic curves, residual drifts and strand stress <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> predicted by <b>the</b> numerical model agree well with the testing data {{and can be used}} to assess <b>the</b> cyclic behavior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers...</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1855 two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> {{then under}} {{construction}} collapsed. Brunel inspected them and rebuilt them {{the following year}} to his original design. In 1867 about 12 ft of one pier was dismantled and rebuilt. Instead <b>of</b> <b>the</b> usual metal tie rods between <b>the</b> tops <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers,</b> this viaduct was fitted with timber ties; vertical timber baulks were fitted at <b>the</b> corners <b>of</b> some <b>piers.</b>|$|R
5|$|In April 2011, {{the pier}} {{was sold to}} a Blackpool family firm, Sedgwick's, the owners of {{amusement}} arcades and the big wheel on Blackpool's Central Pier. Peter Sedgwick explained that he proposed to his wife on North Pier forty years ago, and promised to buy it for her one day. He said {{that he wants to}} restore the Victorian heritage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> and re-instate the pier's tram. An admission charge of fifty pence to access the board-walk section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> was abolished by the Sedgwicks.|$|E
5|$|The Clevedon Pier Preservation Society {{was formed}} in 1972 and started campaigning for the {{restoration}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier.</b> The district council applied for permission to demolish the pier in 1979, but a public enquiry the following year ruled {{that it should be}} retained. The pavilions from the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> were taken ashore in 1982 for storage in anticipation of eventual restoration; insufficient funds were available to complete restoration and the first stage was to open the Toll House as an exhibition centre in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The Palace Pier {{caught fire}} on 4 February 2003 but damage was limited and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> {{was able to}} reopen the next day. Police {{suspected}} arson.|$|E

50|$|Construction on {{the bridge}} began in August, 1902 with <b>the</b> sinking <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b> Workers who worked inside <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> were called sandhogs. They worked one hour at a time twice a day inside <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b> One worker {{died as a result}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bends.|$|R

5|$|The Severn Estuary {{has one of}} {{the highest}} tidal ranges in the world, up to , second only to the Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. The estuary's funnel shape, its tidal range, and the {{underlying}} geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown colouration. The tidal range means that the legs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> are largely exposed at low tide and hidden at high tide and the landing stage at the end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> has several levels to allow boats to dock at all stages of the tide.|$|E
5|$|The town's heyday as a {{seaside resort}} {{was during the}} late Victorian era; the {{population}} nearly doubled from 4,410 to 8,442 between 1881 and 1901. Much of the resulting late Victorian seafront architecture is still in existence today. In 1910, a pavilion {{was added to the}} landward end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier.</b> By 1931, the town's population had grown to 14,533. At the beginning of World War II, the army cut two gaps between the landward end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> and the seaward terminal as a counter-invasion measure. The pier's two gaps were bridged for pedestrians however after the war.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, {{the fate}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> has been intimately {{linked with the}} central {{reclamation}} project which was unveiled in 1989 but not explicitly spelled out as such. However, the scale of reclamations has only been slightly cut back following significant legal battles.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1900. <b>The</b> city <b>of</b> Rostock took {{responsibility}} for constructing the earthworks {{for the new}} railway station premises, <b>the</b> reconstruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers,</b> <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new 1.1 kilometre-long sea channel and <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> a bridge across the old channel {{to connect with the}} station.|$|R
40|$|In his Treatise, Frézier {{describes}} <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapse <b>of</b> a “magasin à poudre” {{built in}} 1732. Frézier tries to infer <b>the</b> cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> incident {{by applying the}} geometrical rule by the De La Hire, which regards <b>the</b> minimum thickness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b> Then, he compares such a thickness with that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> actual <b>piers.</b> In his opinion, <b>the</b> collapse <b>of</b> <b>the</b> powder magazine occurred because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weakness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b> In <b>the</b> present paper we return on this case, {{and we try to}} investigate <b>the</b> real cause <b>of</b> <b>the</b> collapse by comparing the results obtained by Frézier with those arising from an accurate application of De La Hire’s rule and from the methods and tools of modern limit analysis as well...|$|R
5|$|The variable-quality cement {{which had}} been used in <b>the</b> {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Causeway bridges meant that by the early 2000s, they had suffered significant damage, leading to a repair contract being awarded to Kulin Group in 2004. Localised patching <b>of</b> cracks in <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> was undertaken. At <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers,</b> <b>the</b> cracking was more substantial and had to be tied back with carbon fibre reinforcement. Repairs were then coated with moisture-resistant coating, and were expected to lengthen <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bridges by decades.|$|R
5|$|In 2006 {{the pier}} {{was sold to}} Manchester company Urban Splash. The new owners {{launched}} a competition in August 2007, inviting people to submit ideas for the regeneration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> and island. At the time, the repair work required was estimated at £4 million.|$|E
5|$|In December 2002, {{the pier}} {{partially}} collapsed during a storm, when a walkway connecting {{the concert hall}} and pavilion fell into the sea. The following month, the concert hall in the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> fell over, leaving the entire structure close to total collapse.|$|E
5|$|On 8 October 1892, a storm-damaged vessel, Sirene, hit the {{southern}} side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier,</b> causing four shops {{and part of}} the deck to collapse onto the beach below. Several columns were also dislodged, and the ship's bowsprit hit the pier entrance. All eleven crew members were rescued when they were hauled onto the pier. Damage to the pier was estimated to be £5,000 and was promptly repaired.|$|E
50|$|Bridge piers {{comprise}} a box cross-section measuring 5.0 m by 3.2 m with a constant wall thickness <b>of</b> 30 cm. <b>The</b> top <b>of</b> each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> is closed by an Omnia slab 15 cm deep. Each motorway carriageway {{is supported by}} a separate set <b>of</b> <b>piers.</b> <b>The</b> abutments, on the other hand, are designed to support both <b>of</b> <b>the</b> carriageways. The cross-girders are placed at the abutments and <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pier's</b> Floral Hall hosted {{concerts and}} music hall acts. Its first {{resident}} orchestra was Miss Kate Erl and Her Ladies Orchestra. Subsequent conductors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier's</b> orchestra were Clarice Dunnington, William Rees, Lionel Johns and Norman George. Artists who have performed on <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> include Gracie Fields, Leslie Henson, Russ Conway and George Formby.|$|R
50|$|A bridge {{carried the}} railway across the Antrim Coast Road near Waterfoot. The span {{would have been}} iron or steel and has been removed, but the two Ulster White Limestone <b>piers</b> and <b>the</b> {{embankment}} approaching one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> survive. <b>The</b> <b>piers</b> are called <b>the</b> White Arch.|$|R
5|$|The {{demolition}} crew {{took control}} of the site by erecting scaffolding on 6 December 2006, and demolition commenced on 12 December. Workers took down the clock mechanism and clock face, leaving a gaping hole, and then proceeded to lift the clock tower off in one piece. After the protesters had been dispersed, the remainder <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> was completely dismantled, away from the glare of publicity.|$|E
5|$|An {{occupation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> {{was started}} by ten activists on the designated closure date. The campaign was boosted {{by the appearance of}} Chow Yun-fat early on the morning of 28 April to sign the petition, and to appeal pre-emptively to the police not to hurt protesters. Some activists, like Chu Hoi-dick, {{have been involved in the}} Star Ferry pier protest, and took turns to maintain a round-the-clock presence. Leung Chun-yiu spent three nights a week at the site, despite working a full-time job, vowing to block the demolition non-violently in any way he could.|$|E
5|$|On 19 November 2006, the Civic Party, Democratic Party, Harbour-front Enhancement Committee, Hong Kong Institute of Architects, People's Sustainable Development Committee, Clear the Air, and Earth Care jointly met to {{urge the}} public {{to fight for the}} {{preservation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier.</b> Over 1,000 signatures were collected on that one day alone, in a petition to be submitted to Chief Executive Donald Tsang and other senior officials. In addition, a group of protesters began a peaceful sit-in that day. So Sau Chung, veteran campaigner (now a monk), whose hunger strike against Star Ferry fare increases triggered the riots in 1966, came by to lend his support.|$|E

5|$|In 1873, in {{an effort}} to improve {{navigation}} around the bridge and reduce accidents, two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> were removed, making the widest span a more easily navigated , and the bridge deck was strengthened with iron girders to compensate for <b>the</b> missing <b>piers.</b>|$|R
25|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> <b>of</b> Brunel's {{original}} timber viaducts remain today, {{having been}} left in place when the replacement viaduct was built alongside. The original viaducts are fully discussed in the article Cornwall Railway viaducts.|$|R
5|$|On 28 March 2003 the {{pavilion}} at the pierhead caught fire. Fire crews {{were unable to}} save the building from destruction because the collapsed walkway prevented them from reaching it. The cause of the fire remains unknown, since fire investigators were unable to access the site for safety reasons, although it {{is thought to have}} been arson. A more severe fire burned through 11 and 12 May 2003, consuming most of {{what was left of the}} concert hall. On 23 June 2004, high winds caused the middle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> to collapse completely. The following month, English Heritage declared the pier to be beyond repair.|$|E
5|$|The Hong Kong Institute of Planners, the {{majority}} of whose members work in government departments, had backed the in-situ preservation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier.</b> There was uproar in May 2008 when it made an apparent U-turn in a position paper submitted to the government backing the relocation to a waterfront location, based on a sparsely attended meeting. It then submitted a revised paper presenting {{that a majority of}} its members supported such a move as a conclusion prior to the completion of a survey. A former vice-president of the institute questioned how the institute had become allies of the government.|$|E
5|$|The pier {{suffered}} {{structural damage}} {{due to the}} Great Storm of 1987, and access from the shore was removed for safety reasons in 1991. The West Pier Trust continued to offer regular tours <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pier</b> throughout the 1990s. In 1998, the National Lottery pledged £14 million to restore the pier, but the West Pier Trust {{was unable to find}} a suitable partner to help with restoration. The owners of the Palace Pier, who had become financially self-sufficient under their own means, claimed unfair competition. In 2001, English Heritage identified the pier as the most at-risk Grade I listed structure in the United Kingdom.|$|E
30|$|The steel webs are {{connected}} to the concrete deck through connecting plates and shear rods. <b>The</b> webs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> box girder are made of 28 -mm steel plates in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> and 18 -mm steel plates for most of other locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> girder. The steel bottom plates are of 28  mm in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> and <b>of</b> 42  mm around <b>the</b> center <b>of</b> each span. <b>The</b> steel bottom plates in <b>the</b> vicinity <b>of</b> <b>piers</b> are also strengthened by 400 -mm-thickness concrete to resist the shear force. Shell elements with proper thickness are also used to model these connecting plates, webs and bottom plates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> girder (see Fig.  3).|$|R
50|$|He thought <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> {{should have}} been wider (both to {{counteract}} toppling and to increase the horizontal component forces the tiebars could withstand) and rectangular (to increase <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> tiebars directly resisting lateral forces); {{at the very least}} there {{should have been}} lateral bracing between <b>the</b> outermost columns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers.</b>|$|R
25|$|The old Aqueduct Bridge was razed {{beginning}} in December 1933. The Aqueduct Bridge's superstructure and most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> above-water portions <b>of</b> its piers were removed in 1933. <b>The</b> bases <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>piers</b> were retained to protect <b>the</b> Key Bridge's <b>piers</b> from ice floe damage.|$|R
