50|$|This {{style is}} rather rare {{compared}} to most other imported wares {{of the first}} period and comes in 2 groups. The first is a white <b>opaque</b> <b>glaze</b> with a buff body which is more common and is {{a variation of the}} white glazed wares while the second has a dark blue glaze with a white body. Both types are almost always nearly hemispherical bowls.|$|E
50|$|The opacity of glaze {{could be}} {{determined}} by the particles which spread through the glaze, therefore the light is absorbed by the particles, being scattered back before reaching the ceramic body, leading to the <b>opaque</b> <b>glaze.</b> As a result, the concentration of the absorbing or scattering particles in the glaze could determine the degree of opacification. Generally speaking, the more different the refractive index between the particles and the glaze matrix, the larger the opacity. Similarly, the closer the particle size to the light wavelength (100-1000 nm for visible light) and the more irregular the surface, the larger the degree of opacification.|$|E

50|$|The white opaque surface makes {{tin glaze}} a good base for painted {{decoration}}. The decoration is applied as metallic oxides, most commonly cobalt oxide for blue, copper oxide for green, iron oxide for brown, manganese dioxide for purple-brown and antimony for yellow. Late Italian maiolica blended oxides to produce detailed and realistic polychrome paintings, called istoriato. To these oxides modern potters {{are able to}} add powdered ceramic colours made from combinations of oxide, sometimes fritted. In the sixteenth century, the use of subtle and blended colours which were {{not strong enough to}} penetrate the <b>opaque</b> <b>glaze</b> made the delicate control of ton-value possible, and the painting therefore had to be done on the glaze surface, which then becomes a common manner of painting on tin-glazed wares.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the advances in chemistry that allowed the creation of thin-walled vessels, Qingbai is distinguished by its smooth, glassy glaze, achieved by using {{a small amount of}} iron in a reduction fired kiln. The result is the characteristic blue-green tinted finish. Many of the motifs used in the decoration borrowed from textiles. Qingbai ware also borrowed and improved on decoration from the Ding and Yaozhou wares. Minute detail and beading accent the outside rims of many vessels, especially {{towards the end of the}} production. [...] In the early 14th century the Jingdezhen potters created a sturdier ceramic body by adding more kaolin to the clay. This type of ceramic ware is referred to as luanbai (eggshell white) because of its <b>opaque</b> <b>glaze.</b> Luanbai ware was short lived but helped to establish a precedent for new mixtures of clay.|$|E
50|$|Fluid paints {{can be used}} like watercolors, or for glazing and washes. To {{create a}} more fluid , water {{is added to the}} paint. The ratio of paint to water depends on how thick the glaze is {{expected}} to be. An <b>opaque</b> <b>glaze</b> or paint consists of more paint than water, and will give a more solid color. A translucent glaze or paint will be the opposite, consisting of slightly more water than the opaque version, and will have a smoother texture. Translucent glazes show more of the colors underneath the paint compared to opaque glazes. Artist Keri Ippolito advises that the paint should be watered no more than 50 percent or the paint will not stick to the canvas. After mixing the paints, allow time for the air bubbles to rise to the surface. This will be crucial in many techniques, especially in pouring paints.|$|E

40|$|The {{generally}} accepted {{theory is that}} the demand for Islamic glazed pottery started in Abbasid Iraq in the 9 th century AD with the production of a range of glazed wares in response to the import of Chinese stonewares and porcelains. However, Oliver Watson has recently proposed that the demand for Islamic glazed pottery first occurred in Egypt and Syria in the 8 th century AD resulting in the production of opaque yellow decorated wares. Using a combination of SEM analysis of polished cross-sections, and surface analysis using hand-held XRF or PIXE, Coptic Glazed Ware from Egypt, Yellow Glazed Ware from Syria, and comparable wares from Samarra, Kish and Susa have been analysed. The analyses show that the opaque yellow decoration was the result of lead stannate particles in a high lead glaze, which it is suggested was produced using a lead-silica-tin mixture. The use of lead stannate in the production of yellow <b>opaque</b> <b>glazes</b> is explained in terms of technological transfer from contemporary Islamic glassmakers who continued the Byzantine tradition of glassmaking. It is further argued that the introduction of <b>opaque</b> yellow <b>glazed</b> pottery into Mesopotamia could have provided the social context for the sudden emergence of tin-opacified white glazed pottery in Abbasid Iraq in the 9 th century AD. However, in view of the very different glaze compositions employed for the yellow and white <b>opaque</b> <b>glazes,</b> it seems probable that the white tin-opacified glazes used for Abbasid cobalt blue and lustre decorated wares represent a separate but parallel technological tradition with its origins in the production of Islamic opaque white glass.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the physical interactions between pigments, opacifiers and glazes is fundamental to understand the optical behavior of ceramic glazes. In particular the pigment and opacifier grain size distribution is fundamental to determine the optical properties of the glazes directly changing {{the color of the}} product. In this work the influence of the grain size distribution of both zircon (ZrSiO 4) opacifier and yellow zircon-praseodymium pigment ((Zr,Pr) SiO 4) on the color developed by an <b>opaque</b> <b>glaze</b> was evaluated. The glazes were prepared by addition of zircon opacifier (three different grain size distribution) and yellow Pr-zircon pigment (before and after its micronization) to a commercial frit. The color of the glazes were measured with a spectrophotometer and the absorption and scattering properties of the obtained glazes were explained through the Kubelka-Munk model. The opacifier grain size has the major effect on the scattering of the light while the micronization of the yellow Pr-pigment do not affected significantly the reflectance and thus the color of the evaluated glazes...|$|E

40|$|The bubble {{is one of}} {{the most}} common feature in ancient glaze. The size and {{distribution}} of bubbles are closely associated with recipes of the raw materials for the body and glaze and the making process. To characterize the bubbles is essential for the study of ceramic production process, production places, times characteristics and so on. In order to explore the possibility of using the optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging technology to characterize the bubbles and the bubble distribution characteristic in glaze of ancient porcelain, sweep frequency OCT imaging system is used to detect five different types ancient porcelain chips. According to the two dimensional sectional images and three dimensional tomographic images of the transparent layer of glaze obtained by the OCT imaging system, the two dimensional sectional images characteristics and three dimensional slices characteristics of the bubbles in glaze are studied. The bubble characteristics in the glaze and its possible causes that gases in the body of the ceramic overflow to the glaze layer in the firing process are comprehensively analyzed. Meantime, the size of bubble is calculated according to the two dimensional sectional images based on pixel, and the result is compared with the traditional microscopic test result. The bubble size, two dimensional sectional characteristics and three dimensional tomographic image characteristics of <b>opaque</b> <b>glaze</b> are also studied. Experimental results show that the bubble characteristics in glaze of different ancient porcelain chips are obvious difference, the result of the bubble size calculated based on pixel coincides with the result of the bubble size observed by traditional microscope with ten times magnification, slices of the body near the body-glaze binding region based on OCT imaging technology three dimensional tomography can effectively reflect the bubble characteristics in glaze. The measurement of using OCT imaging technology to characterize bubble characteristics of the glaze is proposed, and the feasibility and the validity of the measurement are certified, and the nondestructive detection of bubble characteristics in ancient porcelain glaze is realized.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the physical interactions between pigments, opacifiers and glazes is fundamental to understand the optical behavior of ceramic glazes.

40|$|Surface {{smoothness}} is {{an important}} characteristic of ceramic glazes as it influences chemical resistivity, glossiness and stainability of glazes. Surface crystallinity of zirconia-based and titania-based glazes (as two common opaque glazes), calcium-zinc based matte glaze and also two transparent glazes with different compositions were studied in this work. Degree of surface crystallinity measured by stereological methods using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that transparent glaze has the minimum degree of crystallinity (2. 1 %) and the maximum amount (25. 4 %) was obtained for matte glaze. In addition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the glaze mineralogy. Optical surface profiler showed that the smoothest surface belongs to titania-based <b>opaque</b> <b>glaze</b> (Ra = 0. 0157 µm) and transparent glaze (Ra = 0. 0168 µm). In contrast, the roughest glaze surface corresponded to the matte glaze (Ra = 0. 2772 µm).

In the 13th century, tin glazes reached Italy, where the earliest recorded reference to their use is in the 1330s, resulting in the emergence of Italian Maiolica. Amongst others, Luca della Robbia, born in Florence circa 1400, used tin oxide as an opacifier in glazes. Potters began to draw polychrome paintings on the white opaque surface with metallic oxides such as cobalt oxide and to produce lustreware. The off-white fired body of Delftware and English majolica was made to appear white, and hence mimic the appearance of Chinese porcelain, by the application of a glaze opacified and coloured white by the addition of tin oxide.|$|R
