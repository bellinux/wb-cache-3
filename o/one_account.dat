Bogdan-Pitești (and German funds) were probably involved in financing a new platform, Cronica, launched by Arghezi and Gala Galaction in February 1915. In October of that year, with probable German support, Bogdan-Pitești, Arghezi and Galaction set up another Germanophile newspaper, Libertatea ("Freedom"), presided upon, for a short while, by N.

40|$|I {{show that}} if the capital {{accumulation}} dynamics is stochastic a new term, {{in addition to that}} given by accounting prices, has to be introduced in order to derive a correct estimate of the genuine wealth of an economy. In a simple model with multiplicative accumulation dynamics I show that: 1) the value function is always a decreasing function of volatility 2) the accounting prices are affected by volatility 3) the new term always gives a negative contribution to wealth changes. I discuss results for models with constant elasticity utility functions. When the elasticity of marginal utility is larger than <b>one,</b> <b>accounting</b> prices increase with volatility whereas when it is less than <b>one</b> <b>accounting</b> prices decrease with volatility. These conclusions are not altered when adopting optimal saving rates. ...|$|R
