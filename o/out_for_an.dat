The two ships {{were attacked by}} Japanese aircraft along the way, and were subsequently late in arriving at their destination, missing a planned rendezvous with HMAS Kuru. While returning to Darwin, the pair encountered Kuru south of Betano and it was decided by Castlemaines commanding officer—as the senior officer—that Armidale and Kuru should make for Betano. The two ships took different routes to Betano, during which both vessels came under aerial assault.|$|E

5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it would keep him <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> extended period.

That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of his doctors, with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E

5|$|By 1876 Gilbert had {{qualified}} {{to play for}} Gloucestershire, as {{he had lived in}} the county for the length of time required by the rules. In his first season for the club he finished fifth in the first-class batting averages, scoring 907 runs at an average of 36.28. His highest score was 205 not <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> England XI against Cambridge University, the third-highest score of the season after W. G. Grace's two triple centuries. His innings lasted about seven hours, and he batted on each of the three days of the match. This was his maiden first-class century; he scored another hundred later in the season when he made 143 runs for a combined Kent and Gloucestershire side against a team representing England. In the same season he took 28 wickets at an average of 19.64, including seven wickets for 65 runs in the match between the United South of England XI and the United North of England XI.|$|E
5|$|To {{open the}} second quarter, the Crimson Tide went four-for-four on touchdowns when AJ McCarron {{connected}} on a 29-yard pass to Christion Jones for a 28–0 lead. Up by four touchdowns, backup quarterback Blake Sims took over for McCarron and led Alabama to their fifth touchdown {{in as many}} possessions and Lacy scored on a three-yard run, his third touchdown of the afternoon. After the defense again held Carolina to another three-and-out, Christion Jones fumbled the Catamounts' punt to give them possession at the Alabama 29-yard line. However, Western was unable {{to capitalize on the}} turnover as a Troy Mitchell fumble was recovered by Deion Belue and returned 57 yards for a touchdown and a 42–0 halftime lead. With reserves playing on both offense and defense for the Crimson Tide in the second half, the final touchdown came in the third quarter when Blake Sims scored on a five-yard run to make the final score 49–0. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Catamounts to 2–0 (3–0 without NCAA vacations).This {{was the first time that}} Bryant–Denny Stadium was not sold <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Alabama game since 1986.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, with {{a return}} to {{normality}} after the First World War, Pick began developing plans to extend the Underground network out into suburbs that lacked adequate transport services. The only major extensions made to the Underground network since the three tube lines had opened were {{the extension of the}} District Railway to Uxbridge in 1910, and the extension of the Bakerloo tube to Watford Junction between 1913 and 1917. Approved schemes put on hold during the war were revived: the CLR was extended to Ealing Broadway in 1920, the Hampstead tube was extended to Edgware between 1923 and 1924 and the C was reconstructed and extended to Camden Town between 1922 and 1924. Finance for the latter two extensions was obtained through the government's 1921 Trade Facilities Act which underwrote loans for public works as a means of alleviating unemployment. For new lines, Pick first considered extending Underground services to the north-east of London where the mainline suburban services of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and Great Eastern Railway (GER) were poor and unreliable. Studies were carried <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> extension of the Piccadilly tube on GNR tracks to New Barnet and Enfield or on a new route to Wood Green and plans were developed for an extension of the CLR along GER tracks to Chingford and Ongar, but both mainline companies strongly opposed the Underground's encroachment into their territories.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} summer came the Bodyline series, when England toured under Douglas Jardine and targeted the upper bodies of the Australian batsmen with short-pitched bowling, using a close leg side cordon to catch balls fended away from the body. In one of the tour matches before the Tests, Fingleton scored a defiant 119*, carrying his bat for New South Wales against the bumper barrage of Harold Larwood and Gubby Allen, ensuring his selection for the First Test. Despite his unbending resistance, his state fell to an innings defeat. In a warm-up for the Tests, he scored 29 and 53 not <b>out</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> Australian XI against the tourists, while most of his teammates struggled. His earlier experience held him in good stead as he scored 26 and 40 as Australia were crushed by ten wickets in the First Test in Sydney. Fingleton stood his ground and was hit several times. He then made a defiant four-hour innings to top-score with 83 in the first innings of Australia's only win of the series in the Second Test in Melbourne, although he did run out his batting partner Leo O'Brien in the process. This helped the Australians to reach 228 and they took a 59-run first innings lead before winning the match despite Fingleton making {{only one in the}} second innings. He appeared as well equipped as any Australian to combat England's strategy.|$|E
