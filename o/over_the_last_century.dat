5|$|Galerina marginata is {{widespread}} in the Northern Hemisphere, including Europe, North America, and Asia, and has also been found in Australia. It is a wood-rotting fungus that grows predominantly on decaying conifer wood. An extremely poisonous species, it contains the same deadly amatoxins found in the death cap (Amanita phalloides). Ingestion in toxic amounts causes severe liver damage with vomiting, diarrhea, hypothermia, and eventual death if not treated rapidly.

5|$|Most tern {{species are}} declining in numbers {{due to the}} loss or {{disturbance}} of breeding habitat, pollution and increased predation. Gull populations have increased <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>century</b> because of reduced persecution {{and the availability of}} food from human activities, and terns have been forced out of many traditional nesting areas by the larger birds. A few species are defying the trend and showing local increases, including the Arctic tern in Scandinavia, Forster's tern around the Great Lakes, the Sandwich tern in eastern North America and its yellow-billed subspecies, the Cayenne tern, in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|The NDL is a {{theoretical}} time obtained by calculating inert gas uptake and release in the body, using a model {{such as the}} Bühlmann decompression algorithm. Although the science of calculating these limits has been refined <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>century,</b> {{there is still much}} that is unknown about how inert gases enter and leave the human body. In addition, every individual's body is unique and may absorb and release inert gases at different rates. For this reason, dive tables typically have a degree of safety built into their recommendations. Divers can and do suffer decompression sickness while remaining inside NDLs, though the incidence is very low.|$|E

40|$|Atmospheric {{input of}} {{anthropogenic}} lead increased globally <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>centuries.</b> <b>The</b> present {{study shows that}} the concentrations of lead in sediment cores from low-productivity Hudson Bay, northern Canada, remained relatively constant <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>centuries.</b> <b>The</b> lack of imprint of the increased anthropogenic lead input in this marine environment is {{not consistent with the}} increased lead concentrations in nearby lakes <b>over</b> <b>the</b> same period. In addition, the observed trend in lead isotopic composition in our cores suggests an apparent progressive overprint of anthropogenic lead during the 1900 s. In other words, isotopes clearly registered the increasingly anthropogenic nature of lead in the sedimentary record, but total lead concentrations remained constant, indicating that some process limited the export of lead to the sediment. These observations point to a long-term limitation of the downward export of particles in Hudson Bay. Given that the source of lead was the same for both Hudson Bay and neighboring high-productivity lakes, we hypothesize that the very low primary productivity of Hudson Bay waters was responsible for the low vertical export of lead to marine sediments. We further propose that primary productivity is the most important factor that generally drives the vertical export of particulate matter, and thus hydrophobic contaminants, in near-oligotrophic marine environments...|$|R

25|$|Anatomical {{pathology}} (Commonwealth) or Anatomic pathology (U.S.) is {{a medical}} specialty that {{is concerned with the}} diagnosis of disease based on the macroscopic, microscopic, biochemical, immunologic and molecular examination of organs and tissues. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>century,</b> surgical pathology has evolved tremendously: from historical examination of whole bodies (autopsy) to a more modernized practice, centered on the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer to guide treatment decision-making in oncology.
