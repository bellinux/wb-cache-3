5|$|There {{were now}} four {{possible}} actions for theft, by the victim: the action furti itself and three complementary actions. The actio furti concepti was available against the occupier {{of the building}} in which the stolen goods were found, regardless of his knowledge of them and brought three-times damages. The actio furti prohibiti could be pursued against anyone who declined a search with witnesses, with four-times damages. The actio furti non exhibiti could be brought if the respondent did not bring the thing to court, although its penalty is unclear. There was a further action available to the respondent of an actio furti concepti who had been found liable: he could sue the person who gave it to him, for {{the extent of his}} own liability. That the victim could sue both the thief and handler, if he could show who the thief was, which would have difficult without the presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing.</b> This was both penal, and an attempt to give the plaintiff enough actions to compensate him, because the thief, at least was not usually solvent.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, The Thing was {{released}} as a survival horror third-person shooter for PC, PlayStation 2, and Xbox, {{acting as a}} sequel to the film. The video game differs from the comics in that Childs is dead of exposure, and the audiotapes are present (they were removed from Outpost 31 at the start <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Thing</b> from Another World: Questionable Research). At {{the completion of the}} game, R.J. MacReady is found alive and helping the main character complete the last mission. The game used elements of paranoia and mistrust intrinsic to the film. Some retailers, such as GameStop, offered a free copy of the 1998 DVD release as an incentive for reserving the game. In 2011, a region of the Entropia Universe was created based on the theme <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Thing.</b>|$|E
25|$|The rule in Rylands v. Fletcher {{will not}} cover cases of harm to persons within the {{premises}} where the inherently dangerous activity is carried out, {{for the rule}} requires escape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing,</b> which causes harm from the premises. The new rule makes no distinction between the persons within the premises where the enterprise is operating or and persons outside the premises because escape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>thing</b> causing harm from the premises is not {{a necessary condition for}} the applicability of the rule. Further, the rule in Rylands v. Fletcher, though strict {{in the sense that it}} is not dependent on any negligence on the part of the defendant and in this respect similar to the new rule, is not absolute as it is subject to many exceptions but the new rule in Mehta’s case is not only strict but absolute and is subject to no exception.|$|E

25|$|After {{the conquest}} of Egypt by Alexander the Great and the Hellenization of the Egyptian culture {{initiated}} by Ptolemy I Soter, Isis became known as Queen of Heaven.
