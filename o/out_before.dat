5|$|Arsenal faced {{cup holders}} Liverpool {{at home in}} the {{following}} round. A solitary goal scored by Bergkamp in the 27th minute saw the home side progress in a match layered with controversy: Martin Keown, Bergkamp and Liverpool's Jamie Carragher were all sent off in the space of ten minutes, the latter for hurling back a coin at the crowd. Against Gillingham in the fifth round, Arsenal twice had their lead cancelled <b>out,</b> <b>before</b> Tony Adams scored the winning goal of the match.|$|E
5|$|Board of Trade {{inspections}} {{took place}} in late December 1862 and early January 1863 to approve the railway for opening. After minor signalling changes were made, approval was granted {{and a few days}} of operating trials were carried <b>out</b> <b>before</b> the grand opening on 9 January 1863, which included a ceremonial run from Paddington and a large banquet for 600 shareholders and guests at Farringdon. Charles Pearson did not live to see the completion of the project; he died in September 1862.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{proximity}} of the two schools, the 2009 Chick-fil-A Bowl was only their eighth football meeting. Tennessee held a 5-2 advantage in the series, but before 1994, the last meeting between them was in 1937. The 1994 meeting was in the 1994 Gator Bowl, which the Volunteers won 45-23. Each school rapidly sold its allotment of 17,000 tickets, and publicly available tickets were sold <b>out</b> <b>before</b> the matchup was announced. This gave the Chick-fil-A Bowl its 13th consecutive sellout.|$|E

5|$|In March 1937, {{five months}} after the wreck, the hulk of Ohioan—still aground near Seal Rock—caught fire when a {{watchman}} aboard the ship attempted to burn some meat in a refrigerator. The flames died <b>out</b> <b>before</b> reaching the explosives that remained aboard the wreck. A Pacific storm in December the same year caused the hulk of Ohioan to break in two. By 1939, only remnants of some of Ohioans rusty steel beams were still visible on the rocks.|$|E

5|$|Kevin Nash fought Samoa Joe in {{the seventh}} contest of the night. The match lasted 12 minutes. At two points during the match, Nash {{performed}} his signature Jackknife Powerbomb with Joe kicking <b>out</b> <b>before</b> the three count.

5|$|Shoe polish is {{traditionally}} packaged in flat, round, 60-gram (2-ounce) tins, usually with an easy-open facility. Because {{the amount of}} shoe polish {{that needs to be}} applied is small, and the shoe polish will desiccate due to volatile ingredients, such as naphtha, a large container would dry <b>out</b> <b>before</b> being fully used. The traditional flat, round tins have since become synonymous with shoe polishes.|$|E

5|$|The 193738 {{season was}} purely domestic, with no {{international}} matches, {{but it was}} an opportunity for all players to push for selection in the squad for the 1938 Ashes tour. It was another disappointing season for Queensland, who were again winless; they lost three matches, hung on for a draw, eight wickets down in another, and the other two fixtures were washed <b>out</b> <b>before</b> the second innings. Tallon scored 204 runs at 22.66 without managing a half-century and made 17 dismissals.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{attempts}} to return Frunze to service were to restore her to original design, but money ran <b>out</b> <b>before</b> {{she was even}} half completed. Subsequent plans that focused on reconstructing her as a modernized equivalent to her sisters or even as a battlecruiser, with one turret deleted to save weight, were considered, but finally abandoned on 23 January 1935 when all work was stopped.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest of}} the {{landscaping}} undertakings carried out on the palace's grounds were performed between 1840 and 1848 {{with the aid of}} soldiers, who also assisted in the formation and leveling of the terraces laid <b>out</b> <b>before</b> of the palace's southern façade. Fauna was introduced from various locations throughout the world, including the Mediterranean, the Americas, and East Asia. Flora imported over a 150 years ago still numbers almost 200 species.|$|E

5|$|When Lichtenstein had {{his first}} solo show at the Leo Castelli Gallery in February 1962, it sold <b>out</b> <b>before</b> opening. Golf Ball {{was one of the}} works that Lichtenstein exhibited. Later, Lichtenstein {{included}} Golf Ball in Still Life with Goldfish Bowl, 1972, and Go for Baroque, 1979. The painting exemplifies the novel superimposition of abstraction and figuration. The work also represents abstraction as a result of elimination of three-dimensionality, chiaroscuro and a landscape context.|$|E
5|$|Zoe visits her {{old school}} with Sarah and Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox), recalling her {{relationship}} with her former teacher. She and Sarah get drunk and sleep together, which they both regret and agree to keep quiet. Their one-night stand is later revealed, however, leaving Mike devastated. He throws them both <b>out,</b> <b>before</b> realising how much he loves Zoe and offering to take her back, only for her to refuse.|$|E
5|$|A heated altercation between Ramirez and {{teammate}} Kevin Youkilis {{took place}} on June 5, during a game at Fenway Park against the Tampa Bay Rays. The Boston Globe speculated that Youkilis was angry that Ramirez {{has been slow to}} join a bench-clearing brawl earlier in the game. The altercation may have also been caused by Ramirez objecting to what he believed was excessive complaining by Youkilis about the strike zone, as well as the first baseman's penchant for sometimes throwing his helmet in frustration after making an <b>out.</b> <b>Before</b> the fifth inning, Ramirez was caught on NESN cameras taking a swing at Youkilis. Ramirez and Youkilis yelled at each other and had to be separated by teammates, coaches, and training staff. Youkilis headed out to the field still yelling at Ramirez, while Ramirez was escorted into the tunnel leading to the clubhouse by bench coach Brad Mills and trainer Paul Lessard.|$|E

5|$|A tabloid {{paper offers}} a $10,000 reward for the tiger causing {{the town to}} be {{inundated}} with hunters and reporters. The sheriff forbids anyone from going {{in the woods and}} hunting the tiger, but while out with Deputy Sharon Weinman (Sarah Constible), he sees Roy in the woods. They give chase, but instead find a dead tabloid reporter. The National Guard is called in to help. The sheriff later sees Roy in the woods again and warns him to stay <b>out</b> <b>before</b> taking him home and giving Rose the same warning. After he leaves, she mistakenly believes Roy told the sheriff lies about there being a tiger and chastises him.|$|E
5|$|About 3,000 runestones {{from the}} Viking Age have been {{discovered}} in Scandinavia of which c. 2,700 were raised within what today is Sweden. As many as 1,277 of them were raised {{in the province of}} Uppland alone. The Viking Age coincided with the Christianisation of Scandinavia, and in many districts c. 50% of the stone inscriptions have traces of Christianity. In Uppland, c. 70% of the inscriptions are explicitly Christian, which is shown by engraved crosses or added Christian prayers, while only a few runestones are explicitly pagan. The runestone tradition probably died <b>out</b> <b>before</b> 1100, and at the latest by 1125.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the fifth}} edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Tourette’s may be {{diagnosed}} when a person exhibits both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics over the period of a year; the motor and vocal tics need not be concurrent. The onset must have occurred {{before the age of}} 18, and cannot be attributed to the effects of another condition or substance (such as cocaine). Hence, other medical conditions that include tics or tic-like movements—such as autism or other causes of tourettism—must be ruled <b>out</b> <b>before</b> conferring a Tourette's diagnosis. Since 2000, the DSM has recognized that clinicians see patients who meet all the other criteria for Tourette's, but do not have distress or impairment.|$|E
