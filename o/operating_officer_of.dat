5|$|Warshaw {{and other}} Atari {{executives}} presented this design to Spielberg, {{who did not}} express enthusiasm. Spielberg instead asked him to create a game similar to Namco's Pac-Man. Believing the concept too derivative of a common game design, Warshaw proceeded with his concept, which he believed would capture the sentimentality {{he saw in the}} original film. In retrospect, however, Warshaw stated that Spielberg's idea might have had merit. He spent the remaining time programming the game. Atari anticipated enormous sales based on the popularity of the film, as well as the stability the video game industry was experiencing in 1982. Due to time limitations, Atari decided to skip audience testing for the game. Emanual Gerard, co-chief <b>operating</b> <b>officer</b> <b>of</b> Warner at the time, later suggested that the company had fallen into {{a false sense of security}} by the success of its previous releases, particularly its console version of Pac-Man, which was commercially successful despite poor critical reaction.|$|E
