5|$|In modern times, early {{reports from}} the 1908 Messina {{earthquake}} and World War I on kidney failure after injury were followed by studies by London physicians Eric Bywaters and Desmond Beall, working at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School and the National Institute for Medical Research, on four victims of The Blitz in 1941. Myoglobin was demonstrated in the urine of victims by spectroscopy, and {{it was noted that}} the kidneys of victims resembled those <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> had hemoglobinuria (hemoglobin rather than myoglobin being the cause of the kidney damage). In 1944 Bywaters demonstrated experimentally that the kidney failure was mainly caused by myoglobin. Already during the war, teams of doctors traveled to bombed areas to provide medical support, chiefly with intravenous fluids, as dialysis was not yet available. The prognosis of acute kidney failure improved markedly when dialysis was added to supportive treatment, which first happened during the 1950–1953 Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Of the 40% <b>of</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> develop kidney involvement, {{almost all}} have {{evidence}} (visible or on urinalysis) {{of blood in}} the urine. More than half also have proteinuria (protein in the urine), which in one eighth is severe enough to cause nephrotic syndrome (generalised swelling due to low protein content of the blood). While abnormalities on urinalysis may continue for a long time, only 1% of all HSP patients develop chronic kidney disease. Hypertension (high blood pressure) may occur. Protein loss and high blood pressure, as well as the features on biopsy of the kidney if performed, may predict progression to advanced kidney disease. Adults are more likely than children to develop advanced kidney disease.|$|E

40|$|Background — Systems {{analysis}} of clinical incidents – {{is a relatively}} novel approach to medical care quality improvement. Its basis is studying of healthcare system with use of modeling. The {{purpose of the present}} work was to compare the potential value of different modeling methods, which implemented in systems {{analysis of}} clinical incidents, and form the basis for improvement the quality of medical care delivered to patients with arterial hypertension (AH). Material and Methods — Three types of modeling were evaluated: system modeling, dynamic diagram and cause and effect diagram (Ishikawa diagram). Dynamic diagram was constructed using the example of one of Saratov polyclinics. Developing Ishikawa diagram we used systematic literature review derived from e-library and PubMed resources. Each type of modeling produced quality indicators set (QIS). Studied modeling methods were compared through the level of their QIS’s practice value. Results — The model of healthcare delivery system for patients with AH was constructed. The following QIS was derived from the model: 1) a part <b>of</b> AH <b>patients,</b> <b>who</b> were administered treatment according to the national recommendations; 2) a part <b>of</b> AH <b>patients,</b> <b>who</b> achieved the goal blood pressure (BP); 3) a part <b>of</b> AH <b>patients,</b> <b>who</b> died from cardiovascular diseases. Dynamic diagram of AH diagnostic and treatment in one of Saratov polyclinics was constructed. The following QIS was produced: 1) a part <b>of</b> AH <b>patients,</b> <b>who</b> were administered antihypertensive treatment according to their clinical status; 2) a part <b>of</b> AH <b>patients,</b> <b>who</b> achieved the goal BP. Ishikawa diagram was constructed. The following QIS was obtained: 1) a part <b>of</b> AH <b>patients,</b> <b>who</b> visited primary care units during the last year; 2) a part <b>of</b> AH <b>patients,</b> <b>who</b> were administered antihypertensive treatment according to their clinical status; 3) a part <b>of</b> AH <b>patients,</b> <b>who</b> achieved the goal BP. Conclusion — The major value for quality improvement initiatives has Ishikawa diagram. This diagram covers the maximal number of hypotheses on problem causes and allows evaluation their real impact on unfavorable result independently from the level of care organization...|$|R

Methods A chart review was performed <b>of</b> breast cancer <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> refused or delayed standard surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. Prognosis was calculated for recommended and actual therapy. Results Thirty-three patients were included in the analysis. <b>Of</b> 11 <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> initially refused surgery, 10 developed disease progression. <b>Of</b> 3 <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> refused adequate nodal sampling, 1 developed nodal recurrence. <b>Of</b> 10 <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> refused local control procedures, 2 developed local recurrences and 2 died of metastatic disease. By refusing chemotherapy, 9 patients increased their estimated 10 -year mortality rate from 17 % to 25 %.

40|$|ObjectiveSeveral {{antiepileptic}} drugs (AEDs) such as phenobarbital (Pb), carbamazepine (CBZ), and valproate (VPA) may suppress interictal epileptiform activity. We {{investigated the}} effects of AEDs on electroencephalography (EEG) data from patients with idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). Materials & MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, all patients electroclinically diagnosed with IGE were recruited in the outpatient epilepsy clinic at Shiraz University of Medical Sciences from September 2008 through August 2010. A routine EEG was requested {{at the time of}} referral for all patients. Statistical analyses were performed using Chi square and Fisher’s exact test. ResultsThis study comprised <b>of</b> 336 <b>patients.</b> For about 20. 8 % (70 <b>patients)</b> <b>of</b> them, the initial EEG appeared normal. The first EEG was normal in 14. 2 % <b>of</b> the <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> had newly diagnosed IGE (19 patients). Normal EEG was also detected for 27. 6 % <b>of</b> the <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> received VPA monotherapy (16 <b>patients),</b> 31 % <b>of</b> the <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> received CBZ monotherapy (9 patients), 29. 4 % <b>of</b> the <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> received Pb monotherapy (5 patients), and 11. 1 % <b>of</b> the <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> received lamotrigine (LTG) (1 patient). ConclusionThis study shows that compared to LTG, VPA suppresses generalized interictal epileptiform activity in patients with IGE more effectively. Theoretically, if a drug can frequently induce normalization of EEG, then it may be a better drug for treating IGEs...|$|R
