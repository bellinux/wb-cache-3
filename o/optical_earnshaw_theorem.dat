40|$|Abstract. Diamagnetic {{objects are}} {{repelled}} by magnetic fields. If the fields are strong enough, this repulsion can balance gravity, and objects levitated {{in this way}} can be held in stable equilibrium, apparently violating <b>Earnshaw’s</b> <b>theorem.</b> In fact <b>Earnshaw’s</b> <b>theorem</b> {{does not apply to}} induced magnetism, and it is possible for the total energy (gravitational + magnetic) to possess a minimum. General stability conditions are derived, and it is shown that stable zones always exist on the axis of a field with rotational symmetry, and include the inflection point of the magnitude of the field. For the field inside a solenoid, the zone is calculated in detail; if the solenoid is long, the zone is centred on the top end, and its vertical extent is about half the radius of the solenoid.

Therefore a dynamic (time varying) magnetic field is required to achieve stabilization. EMS systems rely on active electronic stabilization that constantly measures the bearing distance and adjusts the electromagnet current accordingly. EDS systems rely on changing magnetic fields to create currents, which can give passive stability.|$|R
50|$|For {{successful}} levitation {{and control}} of all 6 axes (degrees of freedom; 3 translational and 3 rotational) a combination of permanent magnets and electromagnets or diamagnets or superconductors as well as attractive and repulsive fields can be used. From <b>Earnshaw's</b> <b>theorem</b> at least one stable axis must be present for the system to levitate successfully, but the other axes can be stabilized using ferromagnetism.|$|R
50|$|<b>Earnshaw's</b> <b>theorem</b> was {{originally}} formulated for electrostatics (point charges) {{to show that}} there is no stable configuration of a collection of point charges. The proofs presented here for individual dipoles should be generalizable to collections of magnetic dipoles because they are formulated in terms of energy, which is additive. A rigorous treatment of this topic is, however, currently {{beyond the scope of this}} article.|$|R
50|$|Few {{materials}} {{can be made}} to magnetically levitate stably above the magnetic field from a permanent magnet. Although magnetic repulsion is obviously and easily achieved between any two magnets, the shape of the field causes the upper magnet to push off sideways, rather than remaining supported, rendering stable levitation impossible for magnetic objects (see <b>Earnshaw's</b> <b>Theorem).</b> Strongly diamagnetic materials, however, can levitate above powerful magnets.|$|R
50|$|<b>Earnshaw's</b> <b>theorem</b> {{holds that}} a charged {{particle}} suspended in an electrostatic field is unstable, because {{the forces of}} attraction and repulsion vary at an equal rate that {{is proportional to the}} inverse square law and remain in balance wherever a particle moves. Since the forces remain in balance, there is no inequality to provide a restoring force; and the particle remains unstable and can freely move without restriction.|$|R
50|$|Emile Bachelet applied <b>Earnshaw's</b> <b>theorem</b> and the Braunbeck {{extension}} and stabilized magnetic force by controlling current intensity and turning {{on and off}} power to the electromagnets at desired frequencies. He was awarded a patent in March 1912 for his “levitating transmitting apparatus” (patent no. 1,020,942). His invention was first intended {{to be applied to}} smaller mail carrying systems but the potential application to larger train-like vehicles is certainly apparent.|$|R
5000|$|The idea of {{particle}} instability in an electrostatic field originated with Samuel Earnshaw in 1839 and was formalized by James Clerk Maxwell [...] in 1874 {{who gave it}} the title [...] "Earnshaw's theorem" [...] and proved it with the Laplace equation. <b>Earnshaw's</b> <b>theorem</b> explains why a system of electrons is not stable and was invoked by Niels Bohr in his atom model of 1913 when criticizing J.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{ability to}} use magnets {{external}} to the body to focus therapy to deep tissue targets has remained an elusive goal in magnetic drug targeting. Researchers have hitherto been able to manipulate magnetic nanotherapeutics in vivo with nearby magnets but have remained unable to focus these therapies to targets deep within the body using magnets external to the body. One {{of the factors that}} has made focusing of therapy to central targets between magnets challenging is Samuel <b>Earnshaw’s</b> <b>theorem</b> as applied to Maxwell’s equations. These mathematical formulations imply that external static magnets cannot create a stable potential energy well between them. We posited that fast magnetic pulses could act on ferromagnetic rods before they could realign with the magnetic field. Mathematically, this is equivalent to reversing the sign of the potential energy term in <b>Earnshaw’s</b> <b>theorem,</b> thus enabling a quasi-static stable trap between magnets. With in vitro experiments, we demonstrated that quick, shaped magnetic pulses can be successfully used to create inward pointing magnetic forces that, on average, enable external magnets to concentrate ferromagnetic rods to a central location...|$|R
5000|$|Configurations of {{classical}} charged particles orbiting one another are unstable due to losses of energy by electromagnetic radiation. Even without those losses, <b>Earnshaw’s</b> <b>theorem</b> means that dynamic systems of charges are unstable {{over long periods}} [...] For quite some time, {{this led to the}} puzzling question of why matter stays together as much evidence was found that matter was held together electromagnetically, but static configurations would be unstable, and electrodynamic configurations would be expected to radiate energy and decay.|$|R
50|$|According to <b>Earnshaw's</b> <b>Theorem</b> a paramagnetically {{magnetised}} body cannot rest {{in stable}} equilibrium when placed in {{any combination of}} gravitational and magnetostatic fields. In these kinds of fields an unstable equilibrium condition exists. Although static fields cannot give stability, EMS works by continually altering the current sent to electromagnets to change {{the strength of the}} magnetic field and allows a stable levitation to occur. In EMS a feedback loop which continuously adjusts one or more electromagnets to correct the object's motion is used to cancel the instability.|$|R
40|$|In the {{measurement}} of the levitation force between a vertically magnetized permanent magnet (PM) and a bulk high-temperature superconductor (HTS), PM domains with horizontal components of magnetization are shown to produce a nonnegligible contribution to the levitation force in most systems. Such domains are typically found in all PMs, even in those that exhibit zero net horizontal magnetic moment. Extension of this analysis leads to an HTS analog of <b>Earnshaw's</b> <b>theorem,</b> in which at the field-cooling position the vertical stiffness {{is equal to the}} sum of the horizontal stiffnesses, independent of angular distribution of magnetic moments within the PM...|$|R
50|$|If an F {{quadrupole}} and a D quadrupole {{are placed}} immediately {{next to each}} other, their fields completely cancel out (in accordance with <b>Earnshaw's</b> <b>theorem).</b> But {{if there is a}} space between them (and the length of this has been correctly chosen), the overall effect is focusing in both horizontal and vertical planes. A lattice can then be built up enabling the transport of the beam over long distances—for example round an entire ring. A common lattice is a FODO lattice consisting of a basis of a focusing quadrupole, 'nothing' (often a bending magnet), a defocusing quadrupole and another length of 'nothing'.|$|R
40|$|We {{theoretically}} show that, despite <b>Earnshaw's</b> <b>theorem,</b> a non-rotating single {{magnetic domain}} nanoparticle can be stably levitated in an external static magnetic field. The stabilization {{relies on the}} quantum spin origin of magnetization, namely the gyromagnetic effect. We predict the existence of two stable phases related to the Einstein [...] de Haas effect and the Larmor precession. At a stable point, we derive a quadratic Hamiltonian that describes the quantum fluctuations of the degrees of freedom of the system. We show that {{in the absence of}} thermal fluctuations, the quantum state of the nanomagnet at the equilibrium point contains entanglement and squeezing.

50|$|The {{electrodynamic}} {{ion trap}} currently used in trapped ion quantum computing research {{was invented in}} the 1950s by Wolfgang Paul (who received the Nobel Prize {{for his work in}} 1989). Charged particles cannot be trapped in 3D by just electrostatic forces because of <b>Earnshaw's</b> <b>theorem.</b> Instead, an electric field oscillating at radio frequency (RF) is applied, forming a potential with the shape of a saddle spinning at the RF frequency. If the RF field has the right parameters (oscillation frequency and field strength), the charged particle becomes effectively trapped at the saddle point by a restoring force, with the motion described by a set of Mathieu equations.|$|R
5000|$|A charged particle, such as {{an atomic}} or {{molecular}} ion, feels a force from an electric field. It {{is not possible to}} create a static configuration of electric fields that traps the charged particle in all three directions (this restriction is known as <b>Earnshaw's</b> <b>theorem).</b> It is possible, however, to create an average confining force in all three directions by use of electric fields that change in time. To do so, the confining and anti-confining directions are switched at a rate faster than it takes the particle to escape the trap. The traps are also called [...] "radio frequency" [...] traps because the switching rate is often at a radio frequency.|$|R
40|$|Stable {{levitation}} of one magnet {{by another}} with no energy input is usually prohibited by <b>Earnshaw’s</b> <b>Theorem.</b> However, the intro-duction of diamagnetic material at special locations can stabilize such levitation. A magnet {{can even be}} stably suspended between (diamag-netic) fingertips. A very simple, surprisingly stable room temperature magnet levitation device is described that works without supercon-ductors and requires absolutely no energy input. Our theory derives the magnetic field conditions necessary for stable levitation in these cases and predicts experimental measurements of the forces remark-ably well. New levitation configurations are described which can be stabilized with hollow cylinders of diamagnetic material. Measure-ments are presented of the diamagnetic properties of several samples of bismuth and graphite. 1 Diamagnetic material...|$|R
50|$|Passive {{magnetic}} bearings use {{permanent magnets}} and, therefore, {{do not require}} any input power but are difficult to design due to the limitations described by <b>Earnshaw's</b> <b>theorem.</b> Techniques using diamagnetic materials are relatively undeveloped and strongly depend on material characteristics. As a result, most magnetic bearings are active magnetic bearings, using electromagnets which require continuous power input and an active control system to keep the load stable. In a combined design, permanent magnets are often used to carry the static load and the active magnetic bearing is used when the levitated object deviates from its optimum position. Magnetic bearings typically require a back-up bearing {{in the case of}} power or control system failure.|$|R
50|$|<b>Earnshaw's</b> <b>theorem</b> proved {{conclusively}} {{that it is}} {{not possible}} to levitate stably using only static, macroscopic, paramagnetic fields. The forces acting on any paramagnetic object in any combinations of gravitational, electrostatic, and magnetostatic fields will make the object's position, at best, unstable along at least one axis, and it can be unstable equilibrium along all axes. However, several possibilities exist to make levitation viable, for example, the use of electronic stabilization or diamagnetic materials (since relative magnetic permeability is less than one); it can be shown that diamagnetic materials are stable along at least one axis, and can be stable along all axes. Conductors can have a relative permeability to alternating magnetic fields of below one, so some configurations using simple AC driven electromagnets are self stable.|$|R
