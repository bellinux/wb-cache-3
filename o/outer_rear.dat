25|$|E. imperialis can be {{identified}} from other bees by its relatively large size and relatively sparse hairs, which expose their brightly metallic color. Males have conspicuous white marks around the mouth, whereas similar markings are diminutive in females. Males also have a broad hind tibia, rhomboid or triangular in shape and rounded distally, used as a storage organ for aromatic materials. Male forelegs have five tarsal segments, which have dense tufts of hairs (or ‘brushes’) on the ventral surface, that are useful for picking up oily liquids by capillarity. An elongated pit covered by long hairs (a ‘scar’) {{can also be seen}} on the <b>outer</b> <b>rear</b> surface of the tibia, which shows two lobes, each of which has an opening into the tibial organ. The wall of the tibial organ is extremely wrinkled, on which the inner surface has many large branched hairs. Males also display a characteristic pattern of short, dense hairs on the outer surface of the mid tibia, with one or two small hairy patches within a much larger patch. All E. imperialis are known to have relatively long tongues in comparison to other bee species. They also have two widely separated tufts of hair without any obvious tubes or slits on the second (metasomal) sternum.|$|E

40|$|An {{one year}} {{epidemiological}} study {{was carried out}} between February 2005 and January 2006 in Belgium to assess the Campylobacter prevalence in free-range broiler production. Three successive broiler flocks on 6 belgian farms were investigated {{for the presence of}} Campylobacter ssp. during the rearing period. Each flock was visited four times, before and after the outdoor rearing period. During each visit, samples were taken in the broiler houses (litter, cecal droppings, water-lines, feed, entrance premises) {{as well as from the}} <b>outer</b> <b>rearing</b> environment (open-air range). Conventional microbiological methods combined with biochemical tests were used for the Campylobacter detection, species identification and isolation. Campylobacter prevalence was very high in free-range broiler production during the experimental period. C. jejuni is the main species isolated from all contaminated samples, while mixed C. jejuni/C. coli infections sometimes occured. Contamination of the broiler flocks was increased in summer/autumn, with a 100 % flocks contamination, whereas only 4 (66. 7 %) and 3 (50 %) of the flocks became Campylobacter positive in spring and winter respectively, at the end of the rearing period. Moreover, about 53. 8 % of contaminated flocks were infected with Campylobacter before chicks have access to the open-air range. In 69. 2 % of the Campylobacter-positive flocks, the open-air range soil belonged partly of fully to environmental samples found to be Campylobacter-positive before flock infection. The other potential sources of infection were delivery tray, entrance premises floor and water-lines. The access to an open-air range seems to be an important way of contamination of broilers because Campylobacter prevalence in the flocks increased after going out...|$|R

40|$|A {{one year}} {{epidemiological}} study {{was carried out}} between February 2005 and February 2006 {{in the southern part}} of Belgium to assess the Campylobacter prevalence in free-range broiler production. Three successive broiler flocks from six Belgian farms were investigated for the presence of Campylobacter spp. during the rearing period. Each flock was visited four times, before and after the outdoor rearing period. During each visit, samples were taken in the broiler house (litter, cecal droppings, water-lines, feed, anteroom) as well as from the <b>outer</b> <b>rearing</b> environment (open-air range). The Campylobacter detection in all samples was carried out according to the ISO 10272 standard. Identification was based on colonial morphology, microscopic examination, and biochemical tests. PCR multiplex was used for genetic confirmation. Campylobacter jejuni was the main species isolated from all contaminated samples. Overall, mixed infections C. jejuni / Campylobacter coli represented 40. 6 %, while C. jejuni and C. coli represented 46. 9 % and 12. 5 % of chicken samples respectively. A 100 % flock contamination was observed in the 6 farms during the summer-autumn period, whereas only 66. 7 % and 33. 3 % of the flocks became Campylobacter-positive in spring and winter respectively, at the end of the rearing period. Half of contaminated flocks were infected before chickens have access to the open-air range. Environmental samples, especially the open-air range soil, were found to be Campylobacter-positive before flock infection. The other potential sources of contamination were delivery tray, anteroom floor and water-lines. Other animal productions like cattle on the farm, no applied rodent control, no cleaning and disinfection of water-lines between flocks, no detergent used for cleaning and thinning were recorded as risk factors. In conclusion, the contact with the environment, particularly the access to an open-air range, appeared to be the major way of Campylobacter contamination of chickens in free-range broiler production...|$|R

The jugal bone has short branches to the front, {{in the direction of}} the maxilla and the nasal bone, and a long narrow upwards branch running towards the postorbital bone. In the <b>outer</b> <b>rear</b> side of the lower jaw an opening is present, the mandibular fenestra. The coronoid process of the surangular bone is low. The shoulder blade is considerably longer, 62%, than the coracoid.|$|E
50|$|The other {{function}} of anti-roll bars is to tune the handling balance of a car. Understeer or oversteer {{behavior can be}} tuned out by changing {{the proportion of the}} total roll stiffness that comes from the front and rear axles. Increasing the proportion of roll stiffness at the front increases the proportion of the total load transfer that the front axle reacts to—and decreases the proportion that the rear axle reacts to. In general, this makes the outer front wheel run at a comparatively higher slip angle, and the <b>outer</b> <b>rear</b> wheel to run at a comparatively lower slip angle, which is an understeer effect. Increasing the proportion of roll stiffness at the rear axle has the opposite effect and decreases understeer.|$|E

The Type 98 20 mm Machine Cannon was successfully mounted on the hull of a number of the vehicles after 1937, in place of the 13.2 mm machine gun. In addition, an external anti-aircraft mount was stowed in the vehicle, which could be attached to the <b>outer</b> <b>rear</b> facing of the turret, allowing an additional Type 91 machine gun to be mounted.

5000|$|In 1961, {{the first}} project Copp became {{involved}} in was project [...] "Panda", which became the MkIV Zephyr/Zodiac range. As the car used the new V-series engines, the then traditional long bonnet concept created a problem until Copp required that the car was both larger and had more internal space, {{and came up with}} the idea of placing the spare wheel ahead of the radiator on an angle. The result was a vehicle of similar dimensions to the North American Ford Fairlane. Unfortunately, as the MkIV carried over so little engineering from the MkIII, Copp's insistence on independent rear suspension resulted in an alarming “tuck-under” of the <b>outer</b> <b>rear</b> wheel when cornering with the back seats empty. Neat “bow-back” styling made the capacious boot look deceptively short, but the large expanse of bonnet was unkindly likened to the landing deck of an aircraft carrier by some journalists.|$|E
50|$|Aulacopleura is a genus of proetid {{trilobite}} {{that lived}} from the Middle Ordovician to the Middle Devonian.

Spines at the <b>rear</b> <b>outer</b> corners of the cephalon (or genal spines) are present, typically reaching back to the 2nd to 4th thorax segment. The 'palate' (or hypostome) is not connected to the dorsal shield of the cephalon (or natant). The cephalon is pitted, or has small tubercles. The thorax has up to 22 segments. The pleural ends are usually rounded. The pygidium is small (micropygous), with an even margin.|$|R
50|$|The fossil remains show {{at least}} four unique features, autapomorphies, which {{demonstrate}} that P. nalatzensis is a species distinct from comparable titanosaurians. In the rear vertebrae of the back, {{the top of the}} lamina centrodiapophysealis anterior, the front ridge {{on the underside of the}} lateral process, obliquely curving to the front and above runs parallel to the top of the lamina centrodiapophysealis posterior, the rear ridge, instead of touching it. In the vertebrae of the tail base and the first vertebrae of the middle tail, the neural spines, while being short and erect, possess a conspicuous corner on their front rim, projecting to the front. While vertebrae of the tail base and the first vertebrae of the middle tail are procoelous, thus with a concave front facet of the vertebral centre, some middle tail vertebrae more to the rear are amphiplatous, with flat front and rear facets; but they are again followed by procoelous middle tail vertebrae. The peduncle of the ischium, touching the ilium, has a conspicuous triangular process at the <b>outer</b> upper <b>rear,</b> forming a buttress that overlaps the ischial pedicel of the ilium.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the increased fuel load of the late model Il-76, the Il-78 has two removable 18,230-litre fuel tanks installed in the freight hold, giving transferable loads of 85,720 kg (with hold tanks) or 57,720 kg (without). Controlled from the gunner station, which is stripped of military equipment, three aircraft can refuel in flight simultaneously from the UPAZ-1A (Il-78) / UPAZ-1M (IL-78M) 26m refuelling pods fitted to the <b>outer</b> wings and <b>rear</b> fuselage. In addition, four aircraft can also be refuelled on the ground using conventional refuelling hoses extending from the freight hold. Because of the aircraft's high all-up weight after takeoff, which in an emergency would mean landing at weights well in excess of maximum allowable landing weight, the Il-78 has a fuel jettison system with jettison ports at the wingtips.|$|R
5000|$|As first {{implemented}} in the Acura RL, SH-AWD allows torque to be continuously distributed between front and rear wheels from 70% front/30% rear to 30% front/70% rear, with up to 100% of the rear power being distributed to the outer left or right wheel to assist in cornering and dramatically reducing understeer. For example, in straight line full throttle acceleration, the RL is capable of distributing 40% of torque to the rear wheels and 60% to the front wheels. In a hard turn, of percentage of power distributed to the rear wheels, up to 100% of the rear wheel power can be distributed to the single, <b>outer</b> <b>rear</b> wheel. This action will push the rear around the corner, and helping with steering, reducing understeer and keeping the car balanced and controlled. [...] The effect can be likened to steering in a row boat where applying more power to one oar can turn the boat.|$|E

5000|$|Sadleir et al. (2008) {{established}} several {{traits that}} distinguish Eustreptospondylus from its direct relatives. In {{the corner of}} the lacrimal a shallow depression is present, which is pierced by a smaller foramen. The descending branch of the postorbital has a groove in its <b>outer</b> <b>rear</b> corner. The outer side of the squamosal has a well-developed drooping flange covering, in side view, the upper rear part of the lateral temporal fenestra. The tenth neck vertebra has a clear depression on its front underside. The neck and dorsal vertebrae are not keeled. In 2012 Matthew Carrano added to these traits. The peduncle of the ilium to which the pubic bone is attached, is as transversely wide as it is long from front to rear. With the rear blade of the ilium, the lower edge of the outer blade side is turned upwards to an almost horizontal position, creating and denuding over its total length a bone surface, the [...] "brevis shelf", forming the internal face of the inner blade side — this shelf with dinosaurs functions as an attachment area for a tail muscle, the Musculus caudofemoralis brevis.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, he {{was given}} a court order to make several repairs for health and safety issues. Repairs made {{included}} cleaning of the brick facade and re-grouting the bricks in several locations, removal of several windows, and painting the <b>rear</b> <b>outer</b> wall. Inside, most of the building was gutted to help make it more presentable to potential developers. During the interior work, however, concerns were raised over whether the renovation would jeopardize efforts to obtain any federal or state preservation grants. As a result, no further renovation work was carried out, and while it was reported a development group was interested in buying the building, no changes in ownership occurred. As the building continued to deteriorate, it was described as an [...] "eyesore" [...] and [...] "decrepit" [...] along with being a safety and health hazard with several calls for its demolition.|$|R
5000|$|A {{complementary}} approach uses differential twist or wash out, {{together with}} a swept-back wing planform and a suitable airfoil section. Prandtl, Pankonin and others discovered that washout was fundamental to the yaw stability in a turn of the Horten brothers flying wings of the 1930s and 1940s. Due to the necessity for elevons to be located near the wingtips, {{the one on the}} upward-moving wing causes drag that impedes turning as it deflects the high-pressure airflow under the wing. The Hortens described a [...] "bell shaped lift distribution" [...] across the span of the wing, with more lift in the center section and less at the tips due to their reduced angle of incidence, or washing out. The restoration of outer lift by the elevon creates a slight thrust for the <b>rear</b> (<b>outer)</b> section of the wing during the turn. When displaced, this vector essentially pulls the trailing wing forward to compensate for the [...] "adverse yaw" [...] caused by the elevon. It did not work well in practice.|$|R
50|$|The authors {{indicated}} nine distinguishing {{traits of}} Patagotitan. The first three back vertebra have a lamina prezygodiapophysealis, a ridge running between the front articular {{process and the}} side process, that is vertical because the former process is situated considerably higher than the latter process. With the first two back vertebrae, the ridge running to below from the side front of the neural spine has a bulge at the underside. Secondary articulating processes of the hyposphene-hypantrum complex type are limited to the articulation between {{the third and fourth}} back vertebra. The middle and rear back vertebrae have vertical neural spines. In the first tail vertebra, the centrum or main vertebral body has a flat articulation facet in front and a convex facet at the rear. The front tail vertebrae have neural spines of which the transverse width is four to six times larger than their length measured from the front to the rear. The front tail vertebrae have neural spines that show some bifurcation. The upper arm bone has a distinct bulge on the <b>rear</b> <b>outer</b> side. The lower thighbone has a straight edge on the outer side.|$|R
