50|$|Tinsel wire is {{commonly}} connected to equipment with crimped <b>terminal</b> <b>lugs</b> that pierce the insulation {{to make contact}} with the metal ribbons, rather than stripping insulation. Separated from the core, the individual ribbons are relatively fragile, and the core can be damaged by high temperatures. These factors make it difficult or impractical to terminate tinsel wire by soldering during equipment manufacture, although soldering is possible, with some difficulty, to repair a failed connection. However, the conductors tend to break at their junction with the rigid solder.|$|R
50|$|One type of {{terminal}} block accepts wires that are prepared only by removing (stripping) a short length of insulation from the end. Another type accepts wires that have ring or spade <b>terminal</b> <b>lugs</b> crimped onto the wires. Printed circuit board (PCB) mounted {{terminal block}}s allow individual wires {{to be connected}} to the circuit board. PCB mounted terminal blocks are soldered to the board, but they are available in a pull-apart version that allows the wire-connecting half of the block to be unplugged from the part that is soldered to the PCB.|$|R

40|$|The batch {{chemical}} reaction is {{chosen as the}} process model to be optimized and the rate constants are functions of pressure only, as the reactions are assumed to occur isothermally. The time optimal control problem considered here means to determine the minimum time path from the given initial compositions to desired final compositions by manipulating the process pressure. A gradient method or a steepest-ascent method is applied to determine the control variable program by using the high speed digital computer. Numerical solutions are presented for the following three cases: (1) no constraint on the operating pressure [...] <b>open</b> and matched <b>terminal</b> constraint. (2) constraint on the operating pressure [...] <b>open</b> <b>terminal</b> constraint. (3) constant operating pressure [...] <b>open</b> <b>terminal</b> constraint...|$|R
