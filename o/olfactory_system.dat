5|$|The sperm whale's {{cerebrum}} is {{the largest}} in all mammalia, both in absolute and relative terms. The <b>olfactory</b> <b>system</b> is reduced, suggesting that the sperm whale has a poor sense of taste and smell. By contrast, the auditory system is enlarged. The pyramidal tract is poorly developed, reflecting the reduction of its limbs.|$|E
5|$|Strepsirrhines {{have a long}} snout {{that ends}} in a moist and touch-sensitive rhinarium, {{similar to that of}} dogs and many other mammals. The rhinarium is {{surrounded}} by vibrissae that are also sensitive to touch. Convoluted maxilloturbinals on the inside of their nose filter, warm, and moisten the incoming air, while olfactory receptors of the main <b>olfactory</b> <b>system</b> lining the ethmoturbinals detect airborne smells. The olfactory bulbs of lemurs are comparable in size to those of other arboreal mammals.|$|E
5|$|American {{paddlefish}} are smooth-skinned {{and almost}} entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes {{are small and}} directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During {{the initial stages of}} development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or <b>olfactory</b> <b>system</b> as with the long snouts of other fishes. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly.|$|E

40|$|Artificial <b>olfactory</b> <b>systems</b> {{have been}} studied {{for the last two}} decades mainly {{from the point of view}} of the {{features}} of olfactory neuron receptor fields. Other fundamental olfaction properties have only been episodically considered in artificial systems. As a result, current artificial <b>olfactory</b> <b>systems</b> are mostly intended as instruments and are of poor benefit for biologists who may need tools to model and test olfactory models.

40|$|<b>Olfactory</b> <b>systems</b> are {{evolutionarily}} ancient, {{underlying the}} common requirement for all animals to sense {{and respond to}} diverse volatile chemical signals in their environment. Odor detection is mediated by odorant receptors (ORs) that, in most <b>olfactory</b> <b>systems,</b> comprise large families of divergent G protein-coupled receptors. Here, I discuss our and others' recent investigations of ORs in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, which have revealed insights into the distinct evolutionary origin and molecular function of insect ORs. I also describe a bioinformatics strategy that we developed to identify molecules that function with these insect-specific receptors in odor detection...|$|R
5|$|The <b>olfactory</b> <b>system</b> {{is made up}} in part of the RMS which {{stretches}} from the subventricular zone in {{the wall of the}} lateral ventricle, through the basal forebrain, to the olfactory bulb (OB). VONS is the name given to this pathway, and it consists of the subventricular zone, the RMS, the olfactory tract and the olfactory bulb. Developing neurons leave the subventricular zone and enter the RMS and travel caudally and ventrally along the undersurface of the caudate nucleus; this {{is referred to as the}} descending limb. Upon reaching the ventral side of the caudate nucleus, the neurons follow the rostral limb and travel ventrally and rostrally, entering the anterior olfactory cortex (AOC). The AOC gives rise to the olfactory tract, which ends in the olfactory bulb.|$|E
5|$|The {{coconut crab}} has a {{well-developed}} sense of smell, which it uses to locate its food. The process of smelling works very differently {{depending on whether}} the smelled molecules are hydrophilic molecules in water or hydrophobic molecules in air. As most crabs live in the water, they have specialised organs called s on their antennae to determine both the concentration and the direction of a smell. However, as coconut crabs live on the land, the aesthetascs on their antennae are shorter and blunter than those of other crabs and look more like those of insects. While insects and the coconut crab originate from different paths, the same need to detect smells in the air {{led to the development of}} remarkably similar organs. Coconut crabs flick their antennae as insects do to enhance their reception. They have an excellent sense of smell and can detect interesting odours over large distances. The smells of rotting meat, bananas, and coconuts, all potential food sources, catch their attention especially. Research has shown that the <b>olfactory</b> <b>system</b> in the coconut crab's brain is well-developed compared to other areas of the brain.|$|E
5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium {{can collect}} {{relatively}} non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory olfactory bulb, which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory olfactory bulb, information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main <b>olfactory</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
40|$|In {{visual and}} <b>olfactory</b> sensory <b>systems</b> with high discriminatory power, each sensory neuron {{typically}} expresses one, or very few, sensory receptor genes, excluding all others.

25|$|The vomeronasal organ, {{located at}} the base of the nasal cavity, is the sensory organ for this system. Besides {{locating}} food and water, deer rely on their two separate <b>olfactory</b> <b>systems</b> to detect the presence of predators, as well as to supply them with information about the identity, sex, dominance status and reproductive status of other deer.|$|R
25|$|Another {{interesting}} {{concept is}} that OECs {{are found in}} both the peripheral and central nervous system portions of the primary <b>olfactory</b> <b>system,</b> that is, the olfactory epithelium and bulb.|$|E
25|$|Chemoreception in {{crocodiles}} {{is especially}} interesting because they hunt in both terrestrial and aquatic surroundings. Crocodiles {{have only one}} olfactory chamber and the vomeronasal organ is absent in the adults indicating all olfactory perception {{is limited to the}} <b>olfactory</b> <b>system.</b> Behavioural and olfactometer experiments indicate that crocodiles detect both air-borne and water-soluble chemicals and use their <b>olfactory</b> <b>system</b> for hunting. When above water, crocodiles enhance their ability to detect volatile odorants by gular pumping, a rhythmic movement of the floor of the pharynx. Crocodiles close their nostrils when submerged, so olfaction underwater is unlikely. Underwater food detection is presumably gustatory and tactile.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{demonstrate}} that the changes to the olfactory bulb and main <b>olfactory</b> <b>system</b> following birth are extremely important and influential for maternal behavior. Pregnancy and childbirth result in a high state of plasticity of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>system</b> that may facilitate olfactory learning within the mother. Neurogenesis likely facilitates the formation of olfactory memory in the mother, {{as well as the}} infant. A significant change takes place in the regulation of olfaction just after birth so that odors related with the offspring are no longer aversive, allowing the female to positively respond to her babies. Research with a variety of animals suggest the role of norepinephrine in olfactory learning, in which norepinephrine neurons in the locus coeruleus send projections to neurons in the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. This is significant in the formation of olfactory memory and learning.|$|E
25|$|Habituation {{involves}} decreased {{levels of}} attention and responsiveness to a stimulus {{that is no longer}} perceived as being novel. In the realm of olfactory memory, habituation refers to a decrease in responsiveness to an odor as a result of prolonged exposure (restricted to a certain repeated stimulus), which involves adaptation of cells in the <b>olfactory</b> <b>system.</b> Receptor neurons and mitral cells located in the <b>olfactory</b> <b>system</b> adapt in response to odors. This includes the involvement of piriform cortical neurons which adapt rapidly, more completely and selectively to novel odors and are also thought to play a very important role in the habituation of odors. Norepinephrine is considered to {{have an effect on the}} functioning of the mitral cells by increasing their responsiveness. Acetylcholine is also regarded as an important neurotransmitter involved in the habituation of olfactory stimulus, though the exact means through which it operates are not yet clear.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the spinal}} trigeminal nucleus, {{information}} {{is represented in}} an onion-skin fashion. The lowest levels of the nucleus (in the upper cervical cord and lower medulla) represent peripheral areas of the face (the scalp, ears and chin). Higher levels (in the upper medulla) represent central areas (nose, cheeks and lips). The highest levels (in the pons) represent the mouth, teeth and pharyngeal cavity. Sulfur-containing compounds found in plants in the onion family stimulate receptors found in trigeminal ganglia, bypassing the <b>olfactory</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
40|$|Oscillatory {{dynamics}} is {{a universal}} design feature of <b>olfactory</b> information-processing <b>systems.</b> Recent results in honeybees and terrestrial slugs suggest that oscillations underlie temporal patterns of olfactory interneuron responses critical for odor discrimination. Additional general design features in <b>olfactory</b> information-processing <b>systems</b> include (1) the use of central processing areas receiving direct olfactory input for odor memory storage and (2) modulation of circuit dynamics and olfactory memory function by nitric oxide. Recent results in the procerebral lobe of the terrestrial slug Limax maximus, an <b>Olfactory</b> <b>systems</b> have engaged neurophysiologists interested in stimulus coding, oscillatory dynamics and memory formation for more than 60 years (Gerard and Young, 1937). Robust oscillatory field potentials modulated by odor stimuli, first demonstrated in the olfactory bulb of the hedgehog (Adrian, 1942), have now been documented in the olfactory bulb of {{a wide array of}} vertebrates and in analogous structures in arthropods and molluscs (Delaney and Hall...|$|R
40|$|The moth Manduca sexta {{has been}} a common model {{for the study of}} the insect <b>olfactory</b> <b>systems.</b> The {{neuronal}} architecture in the antennal lobes (ALs) of insects and in the olfactory lobes of vertebrates is similar in structure and development. In Manduca, as in other <b>olfactory</b> <b>systems,</b> sensory receptor neurons send axons into the AL where they form synapses with local interneurons (LNs) and projection neurons (PNs) within the structural units of glomeruli. Here, I present the morphological development of one type of interneuron, the uniglomerular projection neuron (uPN), in normal AL development and in AL development in the absence of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Using fluorescent-dye labeling of uPNs and confocal microscopy, my results show that in the absence of ORNs, uPN dendritic arborization is uncharacteristic of that in normally developing ALs, reinforcing the concept that afferent input guides the development of architecture in sensory areas of the brain...|$|R
40|$|Naturally {{occurring}} odors used by {{animals for}} mate recognition, food identification and other purposes must be detected at concentrations that vary across several orders of magnitude. <b>Olfactory</b> <b>systems</b> must therefore {{have the capacity}} to represent odors over a large range of concentrations regardless of dramatic changes in the salience, or perceived intensity, of a stimulus. The stability of the representation of an odor relative to other odors across concentration has not been extensively evaluated. We tested the ability of honey bees to discriminate pure odorants across a range of concentrations at and above their detection threshold. Our study showed that pure odorant compounds became progressively easier for honey bees to discriminate with increasing concentration. Discrimination is, therefore, a function of odorant concentration. We hypothesize that the recruit-ment of sensory cell populations across a range of concentrations may be important for odor coding, perhaps by changing its perceptual qualities or by increasing its salience against background stimuli, and that this mechanism is a general property of <b>olfactory</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{mammalian}} primary <b>olfactory</b> <b>system</b> {{has retained}} {{the ability to}} continuously regenerate during adulthood. Olfactory receptor neurons have an average lifespan of 6–8 weeks and therefore must be replaced by cells differentiated from the stem cells that are within a layer at the nearby epithelium's base. The new olfactory receptor neurons must project their axons through the CNS to an olfactory bulb {{in order to be}} functional. Axonal growth is guided by the glial composition and cytoarchitecture of the olfactory bulb in addition to the presence of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs).|$|E
25|$|Physiological, {{behavioral}} and anatomical evidence show that some species {{may have a}} functioning <b>olfactory</b> <b>system</b> in utero. Newborn infants respond positively to the smell of their own amniotic fluid, which may serve as evidence for intrauterine olfactory learning. Mammals’ sense of smell becomes mature {{at an early stage}} of development. Fetal olfactory memory has been demonstrated in rats, for example. This is shown by rat pups, who avoid odors that they experienced in association with a noxious stimulus prior to birth. While animal studies {{play an important role in}} helping discover and learn olfaction memory of humans, it is important to pay attention to the specifics of each study, as they cannot always be generalized across all species.|$|E
25|$|While infants are {{generally}} {{attracted to the}} odors produced by lactating women, infants are particularly responsive to their mother’s unique scent. These olfactory cues are used in mammals during maternal care for coordination of mother-infant interaction. Familiarization with odors that will be encountered after birth may help the baby adapt to the otherwise unfamiliar environment. Neural structures such as the olfactory bulb undergo extensive changes when exposed to infantile odors; providing {{a starting point for}} individual recognition by the mother. odors from the breasts of lactating women serve as attractants for neonates, regardless of feeding history of the infant. Maternal olfactory learning occurs due to the high state of plasticity and flux within the <b>olfactory</b> <b>system</b> during pregnancy and childbirth.|$|E
40|$|Sensory {{processing}} circuits in {{the visual}} and <b>olfactory</b> <b>systems</b> receive input from complex, rapidly changing environments. Although patterns of light and plumes of odor create different distributions of activity in the retina and olfactory bulb, both structures use what appears on the surface similar temporal coding strategies to convey information to higher areas in the brain. We compare temporal coding {{in the early stages}} of the <b>olfactory</b> and visual <b>systems,</b> highlighting recent progress in understanding the role of time in olfactory coding during active sensing by behaving animals. We also examine studies that address the divergent circuit mechanisms that generate temporal codes in the two systems, and find that they provide physiological information directly related to functional questions raised by neuroanatomical studies of Ramon y Cajal over a century ago. Consideration of differences in neural activity in sensory systems contributes to generating new approaches to understand signal processing. For over a hundred years, comparing and contrasting olfaction and vision has yielded important insights into their structuralfunctional relationships. Indeed, in 1891, Santiago Ramón y Cajal made a thorough neuroanatomical comparison of the visual and <b>olfactory</b> <b>systems</b> in several species ranging fro...|$|R
50|$|The vast {{diversity}} of olfactory organs is largely {{attributed to the}} long evolutionary lifespan of fish. Representing an evolutionarily older class of vertebrates, fish carry several ancestral OR genes on their chromosome, yet they express wide variation in these genes among individuals and species. Fish have reduced <b>olfactory</b> <b>systems</b> in comparison to mammals since they only contain approximately 100 OR, whereas most mammals can possess 500 to 1000.|$|R

25|$|The main {{olfactory}} bulb {{is one of}} the neural structures that experiences profound change when exposed to offspring odors at the time of childbirth. Human neuroimaging studies suggest that activation of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) occurs during tests of olfactory memory. The medial prefrontal cortex receives extensive olfactory projections, which are activated immediately after birth in correspondence with primary olfactory processing regions. Although there is no functional specificity for the main or accessory olfactory systems in the development of maternal behaviors, {{it has been shown that}} the main <b>olfactory</b> <b>system</b> is affected when individual odor discrimination of the offspring is required; this system experiences significant change following exposure to offspring odors after giving birth. Changes in synaptic circuitry also contribute to the level of maternal responsiveness and memorization to these odors.|$|E
25|$|Olfactory {{memory has}} also been {{developed}} throughout evolution to help animals recognize other animals. It is suggested that smell allows for young infants to identify with their mothers or for humans to identify between males and females. Olfaction cues were also used, and are still used, by many animals to mark territory, protecting themselves from other threats to their survival. While the development of other sensory systems, such as the visual system and auditory systems, has decreased how reliant some animals are on the <b>olfactory</b> <b>system,</b> there is still evidence that shows these animals’ olfactory systems still have a strong influence on their social interactions. The memory for specific odorants gives the animal an opportunity to communicate {{with members of the}} same species and allows for lack of communication between species that do not have the proper receptor systems for the odor. These chemical signals can also be sensed in the dark or even under water.|$|E
25|$|With {{regard to}} host location, female {{mosquitoes}} hunt their blood host by detecting organic substances such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and 1-octen-3-ol produced from the host, and through visual recognition. Mosquitoes prefer some people over others. The preferred victim's sweat simply smells better than others' {{because of the}} proportions of the carbon dioxide, octenol and other compounds that make up body odor. The most powerful semiochemical that triggers the keen sense of smell of Culex quinquefasciatus is nonanal. Another compound identified in human blood that attracts mosquitoes is sulcatone or 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, especially for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with the odor receptor gene Or4. A {{large part of the}} mosquito’s sense of smell, or <b>olfactory</b> <b>system,</b> is devoted to sniffing out blood sources. Of 72 types of odor receptors on its antennae, at least 27 are tuned to detect chemicals found in perspiration. In Aedes, the search for a host takes place in two phases. First, the mosquito exhibits a nonspecific searching behavior until the perception of host stimulants, then it follows a targeted approach.|$|E
50|$|Since insects play a {{large role}} in {{spreading}} infectious blood borne diseases between humans, understanding how they locate their human hosts with their <b>olfactory</b> <b>systems</b> could lead to inhibiting their method of locating hosts. The potential strategy involved would be to create small molecules that mimic the Or83b mutation and inhibit the receptor and disperse them, since it would be impractical to mutate the gene for the receptor in an entire population of disease-spreading insects 3.|$|R
