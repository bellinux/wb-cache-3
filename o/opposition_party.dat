40|$|The paper {{argues that}} the {{scholarship}} on democracy in Africa has paid insufficient attention {{to the nature of}} <b>opposition</b> <b>parties.</b> It first examines <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> in contemporary Africa, studying trends in electoral composition and legislative politics. The paper then links informal and formal institutions, focusing on <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> and on the factors that may explain the strength and weaknesses of <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> across the region in recent years. The authors suggest a weak or even non-existent relationship between level of democratic institutionalization and the size of <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> across the region. Comparative and case analyses of sub-Saharan African elections confirm the weakness of <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> in Africa as a striking characteristic of the multi-party systems in the region...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{research}} has paid increasing {{attention to the}} role of political institutions such as legislatures and <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> in autocracies. So far, however, the relationship between nondemocratic institutions and state repression has remained largely unclear. This article argues that authoritarian institutions are related to divergent conflicting dynamics between incumbent regimes and opposition actors, which provide leaders with opposite incentives to repress. While authoritarian legislatures enhance leaders’ capacity to prevent conflict and reduce their need for repression, the presence of <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> helps <b>opposition</b> actors to overcome collective action barriers and mobilize against the incumbent regime, increasing the states’ need for repression. A panel data analysis of nondemocracies from 1976 to 2007 shows that authoritarian-elected legislatures reduce repression and the presence of <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> increases it. Moreover, the results indicate that autocracies with <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> and an elected legislature experience lower repression than autocracies with <b>opposition</b> <b>parties</b> but no elected legislature...|$|R

5|$|The unity {{government}} suffered a partial collapse in 1995. The continuing violence, along with appointing {{of local government}} officials who were almost exclusively RPF Tutsi, caused serious disagreement between Kagame and senior Hutu government members, including prime minister Faustin Twagiramungu and interior minister Seth Sendashonga. Twagiramungu resigned in August, and Kagame fired Sendashonga and three others the next day. Pasteur Bizimungu remained president but {{the makeup of the}} new government was predominantly RPF Tutsi loyal to Kagame.

5|$|According to an {{official}} government press agency dispatch, {{about half of}} the candidates (approx. 360) were PZPR members. A majority of the remainder belonged to PZPR allies (Democratic Party (SD), United People's Party (ZSL)). There was no <b>opposition</b> <b>party</b> in Poland since all political groupings had to support the program of the PZPR. As a result, no real opposition candidates were permitted to run in the elections, but in theory the Polish voters could have stripped the communists from their claimed legitimacy by abstaining from voting. Another means of preventing the PZPR from obtaining a political victory would have occurred if all of the PZPR candidates were struck out, leaving only 100 to be elected.|$|E

The position is especially crucial during periods of minority government, when no party has {{a majority in the}} House and the government must rely on the support of one or more <b>Opposition</b> <b>parties</b> to not only pass its legislative agenda but remain in power.

5|$|In the November 1980 general elections, Governor Romero Barceló was re-elected by {{a margin}} of 3,503 votes (one of the closest in Puerto Rico history), though his party lost control of the state {{legislature}} to the main <b>opposition</b> <b>party,</b> the PPD. This loss was attributed by The New York Times to the surrounding controversy regarding the investigations at the time. Other news organizations, such as Time, attributed the loss to Gov. Romero Barcelo's stance on the island's political status. The Legislature quickly started new inquiries and hearings into the Cerro Maravilla incident. The Senate, then presided by Miguel Hernández Agosto, spearheaded the investigations by naming former Assistant District Attorney Hector Rivera Cruz to investigate.|$|E
