5|$|Instead, Super Mario 64 was {{followed}} by other 3D Mario games on subsequent Nintendo systems, such as Super Mario Sunshine for the GameCube and Super Mario Galaxy for the Wii. These later titles built on Super Mario 64s core design of enhancement items and <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> gameplay. Super Mario Galaxy 2 features a remake of Mario 64s Whomp's Fortress level. Later 3D titles, namely Super Mario 3D Land and Super Mario 3D World, while keeping many of Super Mario 64s core gameplay elements, departed from the game's open-ended design and focused more on platforming reminiscent of 2D titles. The Nintendo Switch game Super Mario Odyssey returns to Super Mario 64s open design.|$|E
5|$|Targets for NIF are {{extremely}} expensive. Each one {{consists of a}} small <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> metal cylinder with transparent double-pane windows sealing each end. In order to efficiently convert the driver laser's light to the x-rays that drive the compression, the cylinder has to be coated in gold or other heavy metals. Inside, suspended on fine plastic wires, is a hollow plastic sphere containing the fuel. In order to provide symmetrical implosion, the metal cylinder and plastic sphere have extremely high machining tolerances. The fuel, normally a gas at room temperature, is deposited inside the sphere and then cryogenically frozen until it sticks {{to the inside of}} the sphere. It is then smoothed by slowly warming it with an infrared laser to form a 100µm smooth layer on the inside of the pellet. Each target costs tens of thousands of dollars.|$|E

5|$|The cast {{finished}} filming {{their final}} episode for 2005 on 20 December, {{aware that the}} show's future {{was the subject of}} discussion, but at this point the show had not been cancelled. To prepare for the possibility of cancellation, two alternate endings for the show were filmed in 2005 for a possible series finale in 2006. One ending was left <b>open</b> <b>ended,</b> to serve as a lead-in to a possible 14th season, the other ending wrapped up all the show's storylines. The cast were on their New Year non-rating period hiatus when they were told of Blue Heelers cancellation. Thus, the eleven final episodes the cast had filmed in late 2005 were to be used for the 2006 season. For the series finale, the latter ending, wrapping up the show's storylines was used. Although, rather than completely wrapping everything up, the producers made it possible to resume from where they left off, should Seven decide to start producing Blue Heelers again.|$|E

25|$|Interpretation of {{the data}} {{transmitted}} from the craft {{was published in the}} journal Science. As per the peer reviewed data the presence of water ice has been confirmed and that the site had a wetter and warmer climate in the recent past. Finding calcium carbonate in the Martian soil leads scientists to believe that the site had been wet or damp in the geological past. During seasonal or longer period diurnal cycles water may have been present as thin films. The tilt or obliquity of Mars changes far more than the Earth; hence times of higher humidity are probable. The data also confirms the presence of the chemical perchlorate. Perchlorate makes up a few tenths of a percent of the soil samples. Perchlorate is used as food by some bacteria on Earth. Another paper claims that the previously detected snow could lead to a buildup of water ice. The reports leaves the question of presence of organic compounds <b>open</b> <b>ended</b> since heating the samples containing perchlorate would have broken down the organic material.|$|E
25|$|A feature {{not found}} in {{previous}} Souls games are Chalice Dungeons. Chalice Dungeons are randomly generated dungeons that vary in depth and difficulty, and can be reformed by performing a ritual with a Chalice and other certain materials in the Hunter's Dream. Chalice Dungeons are optional and provide additional content to the player. Gameplay {{is much the same}} as the main story in that it contains various areas and enemies that the player must overcome to complete the Dungeon. Each Chalice Dungeon contains multiple bosses that the player must defeat to progress through the Dungeon's levels. Special types of lootable chests that are {{not found in}} the main story are hidden throughout the Dungeons, providing the player with the materials to generate more Dungeons. One major difference between the main story and the Chalice Dungeons is the world design. In the main story world of Yharnam, the design is <b>open</b> <b>ended,</b> more spacious, and is a mixture of indoor and outdoor environments. Chalice Dungeons are only indoors, cramped, and contain many traits of a typical dungeon. The branching paths featured in the main story are still present in the Chalice Dungeons. Another important difference are the objectives. In the main story, players journey through many different locations with many different objectives. In the Chalice Dungeons, the player's basic objective is to locate a door, then find the lever to open the door, which is located elsewhere, and then battle the boss behind the door. After the boss is defeated, the player enters the next area, which will be completely different, and completes the same goal. The cycle repeats at least three times before the entire Chalice Dungeon is cleared. Chalice Dungeons, like the main story, can be played alone or cooperatively with other players.|$|E

500|$|The casting, mainly Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe, {{is often}} cited {{as one of the}} film's high points. Eric Harrison, of the Houston Chronicle, was {{initially}} skeptical of the casting of Maguire, but, after seeing the film, he stated, [...] "within seconds, however, it becomes hard to imagine anyone else in the role." [...] USA Today critic Mike Clark believed the casting rivaled that of Christopher Reeve as 1978's Superman.

40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigated propagation {{characteristics of}} the shock wave driven by a gaseous detonation wave emerging from the <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of a cylindrical detonation tube. In the present study, we visualized the shock wave and exhaust flowfields using a shadowgraph optical system and we obtained peak overpressure in the tube axial direction and the continuous shape transformation of shock waves around the tube <b>open</b> <b>end.</b> We also obtained overpressure histories of the shock wave using piezo-pressure transducers within 201 m from the <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of the tube. We normalized and classified these results by four regions using non-dimensional pressure and distance which are independent of variety of mixture and tube diameter. In {{the vicinity of the}} <b>open</b> <b>end</b> of the tube, the shock wave is nearly planar and does not significantly attenuate, and the peak overpressure maintains approximately C–J pressure. Subsequently, the shock wave attenuates rapidly, transforming from quasi-spherical to spherical. Farther from the tube <b>open</b> <b>end,</b> the shock wave propagates with approximately sound characteristic so that the peak overpressure decreases proportional to 1 /r. Eventually, the shock wave begins to attenuate more rapidly than ideal sound attenuation, which {{may be due to the}} viscous effect...|$|R

[...] Ybarra stated that the game was almost cancelled more than once, and came out about a year behind schedule. Johnson was guided by Archon designer Paul Reiche III during development. Reiche advised him to draft a [...] "story network" [...] that would highlight all the most important points of the story and list the in-game objects necessary to advance from one to the next. The designers rewrote the script multiple times. The group designed what they called a [...] "fractal generator", which took six man-years to develop and allowed them {{to increase the number of}} planets in the game from 50 to 800. The game was one of the earliest to use procedurally generated content for planets and everything on them. The techniques used created a type of roguelike environment on each planet, with the contents randomly distributed. The story network was also one of the earliest examples of a sandbox game design. They created a separate ecosystem generator over the course of two man-years of work. The alien names were created by randomly combining syllables until they had names they liked, and their code for simulating communications was rewritten four times before completion.|$|E
