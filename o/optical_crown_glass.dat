It {{replaced}} lead(II) oxide in the production of certain kinds of glass such as <b>optical</b> <b>crown</b> <b>glass.</b> While lead oxide raised the refractive index, it also raised the dispersive power, which barium oxide does not alter. Barium oxide also has use as an ethoxylation catalyst in the reaction of ethylene oxide and alcohols, which takes place between 150 and 200 °C.|$|E
50|$|Glass lenses {{have become}} less common {{owing to the}} danger of {{shattering}} and their relatively high weight compared to CR-39 plastic lenses. They still remain in use for specialised circumstances, for example in extremely high prescriptions (currently, glass lenses can be manufactured up to a refractive index of 1.9) and in certain occupations where the hard surface of glass offers more protection from sparks or shards of material. If the highest Abbe value is desired, the only choices for common lens optical material are <b>optical</b> <b>crown</b> <b>glass</b> and CR-39.|$|E
5000|$|The Protar is {{considered}} the first [...] "modern" [...] lens, because it had an asymmetric formula allowed by the new design freedom opened up by newly available barium oxide, <b>crown</b> <b>optical</b> <b>glasses.</b> These glasses were invented by Ernst Abbe, a physicist, and Otto Schott, a chemist, (both Germany) in 1884, working for Carl Zeiss' Jena Glass Works. Schott glasses have higher refractive index than soda-lime <b>crown</b> <b>glass</b> without higher dispersion. The Protar's front achromat used older glass, but the rear achromat used high index glass. Virtually all good quality photographic lenses since circa 1930 are anastigmat corrected.

40|$|The {{precision}} {{of the values}} of a magnetic field generated by electromagnetic flux compression was investigated in ultra-high magnetic fields of up to 700 T. In an attempt to calibrate the magnetic field measured by pickup coils, precise Faraday rotation (FR) measurements were conducted on <b>optical</b> (quartz and <b>crown)</b> <b>glasses.</b> A discernible "turn-around" phenomenon was observed in the FR signal as well as the pickup coils before the end of a liner implosion. We found that the magnetic field measured by pickup coils should be corrected by taking into account the high-frequency response of the signal transmission line. Near the peak magnetic field, however, the pickup coils failed to provide reliable values, leaving the FR measurement as the only method to precisely measure an extremely high magnetic fields.

25|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>optical</b> <b>glass</b> is <b>crown</b> <b>glass,</b> which has an index of {{refraction}} of about 1.52. An optimal single-layer coating would have to be made of a material with an index of about 1.23. Unfortunately, there are no solid materials with such a low refractive index. The closest materials with good physical properties for a coating are magnesium fluoride, MgF2 (with an index of 1.38), and fluoropolymers (which can have indices as low as 1.30, but are more difficult to apply). MgF2 on a <b>crown</b> <b>glass</b> surface gives a reflectance of about 1%, compared to 4% for bare glass. MgF2 coatings perform much better on higher-index glasses, especially those with index of refraction close to 1.9. MgF2 coatings are commonly used because they are cheap, and when they are designed for a wavelength {{in the middle of the}} visible band, they give reasonably good anti-reflection over the entire band. Researchers have produced films of mesoporous silica nanoparticles with refractive indices as low as 1.12, which function as antireflection coatings.|$|R
50|$|As {{well as the}} {{specific}} material named <b>crown</b> <b>glass,</b> there are other optical glasses with similar properties that are also called <b>crown</b> <b>glasses.</b> Generally, this is any glass with Abbe numbers in the range 50 to 85. For example, the borosilicate glass Schott BK7 is an extremely common <b>crown</b> <b>glass,</b> used in precision lenses. Borosilicates contain about 10% boric oxide, have good optical and mechanical characteristics, and are resistant to chemical and environmental damage. Other additives used in <b>crown</b> <b>glasses</b> include zinc oxide, phosphorus pentoxide, barium oxide, fluorite and lanthanum oxide.|$|R
5000|$|Abbe {{numbers are}} used to {{classify}} glass and other optical materials {{in terms of their}} chromaticity. For example, the higher dispersion flint glasses have V < 55 whereas the lower dispersion <b>crown</b> <b>glasses</b> have larger Abbe numbers. Values of V range from below 25 for very dense flint glasses, around 34 for polycarbonate plastics, up to 65 for common <b>crown</b> <b>glasses,</b> and 75 to 85 for some fluorite and phosphate <b>crown</b> <b>glasses.</b>|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{methods have}} been {{proposed}} to estimate the indentation fracture toughness Kic for brittle materials. These methods generally uses formulæ established from empirical correlations between critical applied force, or average crack length, and classical fracture mechanics tests. This study compares several models of fracture toughness calculation obtained by using Vickers indenters. Two <b>optical</b> <b>glasses</b> (<b>Crown</b> and Flint), one vitroceramic (Zerodur) and one ceramic (hydroxyapatite) are tested. Fracture toughness and hardness are obtained by using instrumented Vickers indentation at micrometer scale. Young's moduli are obtained by instrumented Berkovich indentation at nanometer scale. Fracture toughness is calculated with models involving crack length measurements, and by models free of crack length measurements by considering critical force, chipping, pop-in. Finally, method based on the cracking energy, commonly employed for coated materials is also used. The aim of this work is to compare seven methods, which enable the facture toughness determination, on four brittle materials. To do so, {{it was necessary to}} determine some specific constant in the case of Vickers tip use. On the one hand, results show that methods using crack length, critical force, edge chipping or pop-in lead to comparable results, and the advantages and drawbacks are highlighted. On the other hand, the indentation energy method leads to underestimated results of about 20 %...|$|R

He found that the English <b>crown</b> <b>glass</b> and the German table glass both contained defects occasioning irregular refraction. In the thicker and larger glasses, there would be more of such defects, so that in larger telescopes this kind of glass would not be fit for object glasses.

40|$|Abstract. Most {{optical glasses}} are {{in recent years}} being {{manufactured}} by diamond turning processes which has certainly modernized the field of production of optics. Confines of diamond turning for both form and surface finish accuracy have not been reached, yet. In advent of contemporary technology, high precision finishing techniques are of great concern and the need of present industrialized-scenario. This paper presents {{the development of a}} small rotary multi-jet abrasive fluid jet polishing tool for use in polishing of optical glasses. The newly designed and manufactured tool has relative angular speed with respect to the spindle of machining centre and is capable of polishing at micro levels. The paper also investigates the optimal polishing parameters for selected, <b>crown</b> <b>optical</b> <b>glass</b> based on experiments conducted using Taguchi’s experimental method. According to the possible number of control factors L 18 orthogonal array was used. ANOVA analysis was carried out to determine the main factors which would affect the surface roughness significantly. Consequently, a 2. 5 µm size of Al 2 O 3 abrasive, 10 wt % abrasive concentration, 40 rpm of polishing head rotation, 6 numbers of nozzles, 6 kg/cm 2 of fluid pressure, 45 minuet of polishing time and 40 % of step over {{have been found to be}} the optimal parameters. It was observed that about 97. 22 % improvements on surface roughness; Ra, from 0. 360 µm to 0. 010 µm has been achieved using the optimal parameters.
