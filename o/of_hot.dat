5|$|Several {{negative}} effects {{may be attributed}} to the drinking <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> chocolate. The types and severity of health risks vary between different styles <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> chocolate. Hot chocolate made from milk also contains the sugars naturally found in milk. Processed cocoa powder usually contains additional sugars. Some brands also contain hydrogenated oils and fats, the most common of which are coconut derivatives.|$|E
5|$|Analyzing deep-infrared images {{obtained}} by the Spitzer Space Telescope and Gemini North telescope, astronomers discovered {{that one of the}} cluster's stars – HD 23514, which has a mass and luminosity a bit greater than that of the Sun, is surrounded by an extraordinary number <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> dust particles. This could be evidence for planet formation around HD 23514.|$|E

5|$|The {{increasing}} popularity <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> rodding cars (modifying them {{to increase}} performance) {{is reflected in}} part by the creation of special-interest magazines catering to this culture.

Hot Rod has licensed affiliation with Universal Technical Institute.|$|E

Another 5,000 years of dormancy followed, only to be upset {{by the beginning of}} the Swift Creek eruptive period, typified by pyroclastic flows, dome growth and blanketing of the countryside with tephra. Swift Creek ended 8,000 years ago.|$|E

5|$|Zinc powder is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} propellant in model rockets. When a compressed mixture of 70% zinc and 30% sulfur powder is ignited there is a violent chemical reaction. This produces zinc sulfide, together with large amounts <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> gas, heat, and light.|$|E
5|$|A {{dust devil}} (also {{known as a}} whirlwind) resembles a tornado {{in that it is}} a {{vertical}} swirling column of air. However, they form under clear skies and are no stronger than the weakest tornadoes. They form when a strong convective updraft is formed near the ground on a hot day. If there is enough low level wind shear, the column <b>of</b> <b>hot,</b> rising air can develop a small cyclonic motion that can be seen near the ground. They are not considered tornadoes because they form during fair weather and are not associated with any clouds. However, they can, on occasion, result in major damage.|$|E
5|$|A {{third part}} of the planet finding mission was the search for Jupiter-mass planets around young stars. The survey would have helped {{scientists}} understand more about solar system formation, including the occurrence <b>of</b> <b>hot</b> Jupiters. This portion of the planet hunt was designed to study systems {{with one or more}} Jupiter mass planets before the system has reached long term equilibrium. Planet hunting techniques using a star's radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star. It is through the techniques pioneered by Albert A. Michelson that the SIM {{would have been able to}} execute its three primary planet-finding missions.|$|E
30|$|Previous {{publications}} show a N–NW fault through {{crystalline rock}} {{aligned with the}} Nam Mae Chai (river) north <b>of</b> the <b>hot</b> springs, which was called the Mae Chai fault (Chaturongkawanich et al. 1980; Amatyakul et al. 2016) (Fig.  6). No features, other than river alignment, have been found for this fault. Sound hard crystalline rock occurs in the river bed over a distance of 2  km north <b>of</b> the <b>hot</b> springs, with no observed breccia or fracture zones. The stream alignment does generally parallel the N–NW alignment <b>of</b> <b>hottest</b> seeps (Fig.  23) and also the NW striking fault observed by Shawe (1984) in the fluorspar mine (Fig.  13), but its significance is uncertain.|$|R
