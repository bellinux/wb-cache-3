Clough continued his research and instruction <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>students</b> at Virginia Tech in addition to his administrative responsibilities. Clough's research focused on geotechnical engineering, including earthquake studies, numerical analysis, soil structure interaction, in-situ testing, and underground openings.

Enrolment grew from 1,089students upon his arrival in 1961 to 5,503students on his departure in 1971. In 1959, there were two degrees and five programs available; in 1969–70 there were seven degrees and 45programs. There were 94graduate students in 1961; the first master's programs were offered in 1967, and by 1969 the number <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>students</b> had risen to 741. In 1969 alone, 80new faculty members were hired, a number larger than the total number of faculty members a decade earlier. Several new buildings were constructed, including nine dormitories and five academic buildings. Policy changes occurred as well: in 1966, the curfew for junior and senior women was abolished, and fraternities and sororities were allowed on campus. In 1970, Boyd was named the University System of Georgia's first vice chancellor for academic development, effective once his successor (Emory graduate Ward B. Pafford) was appointed in 1971.|$|E

5|$|The {{student body}} of Dalhousie is {{currently}} represented by two student unions; the Dalhousie Student Union, {{which represents the}} general student population, and the Dalhousie Association for Graduate Students, which represents the interests <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>students</b> specifically. Dalhousie Student Union began as the Dalhousie Student Government in 1863, and was renamed the University Student Council before taking its present name. The student union recognizes more than 100 student organizations and societies.

Accredited extracurricular organizations at the university fall {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Dalhousie Student Union, and must conform to its by-laws. As of 2011, there were three sororities (Omega Pi, Iota Beta Chi, and Alpha Gamma Delta) and three fraternities (Phi Delta Theta, Sigma Chi, and Phi Kappa Pi).

Graduate campus groups include the Graduate Employees Union and the Council <b>of</b> <b>Graduate</b> <b>Students.</b> Michigan State also has a variety of partisan groups ranging from liberal to conservative, including the College Republicans, the College Democrats and several third party organizations. Other partisan activist groups include Young Americans for Freedom and Young Americans for Liberty on the right; Young Democratic Socialists, Students for Economic Justice, Young Communist League and MEChA on the left. Given MSU's proximity to the Michigan state capital of Lansing, many politically inclined Spartans intern for state representatives.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{university}} also operates the McMaster Nuclear Reactor, used for nuclear {{science and engineering}} research since 1959. The University regularly acquires an operating license for the reactor from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, with the latest 10-year license issued on 1 July 2014. The strength of nuclear science at McMaster was augmented in 1968 under the presidency of Dr. H.G. Thode by {{the construction of a}} 10MV Model FN Tandem particle accelerator. The 3MV Model KN single-ended accelerator was added the same year. The academic direction of the laboratory fell to the Physics Department in the early days, as it was primarily a nuclear structure laboratory. During the next 28 years, the nuclear research effort was extensive, with hundreds <b>of</b> <b>graduate</b> <b>students</b> trained and many publications generated. The SLOWPOKE reactor is used for research, educational, and commercial applications such as neutron radiography, and medical radioisotope production; Iodine-125 is used in cancer therapy. The reactor at McMaster produces 25 percent of the world's supply of iodine-125, an isotope used in nuclear medicine to treat prostate cancer. The production of molybdenum-99 at Chalk River Laboratories has occasionally been moved to the University's reactor, when Chalk River's National Research Universal reactor is forced to shut down.|$|E
