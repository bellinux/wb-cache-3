5|$|According to {{the solar}} nebular disk model, rocky planets {{form in the}} inner part of the protoplanetary disk, within the frost line, where the {{temperature}} is high enough to prevent condensation of water ice and other substances into grains. This results in coagulation of purely rocky grains {{and later in the}} formation <b>of</b> <b>rocky</b> planetesimals. Such conditions are thought to exist in the inner 3–4AU part of the disk of a Sun-like star.|$|E
5|$|On 22 January 1840, {{two days}} after the {{discovery}} of the coast west of the Balleny Islands, some members of the crew of the 1837–40 expedition of Jules Dumont d'Urville disembarked on the highest islet of a group <b>of</b> <b>rocky</b> islands about 4km from Cape Géodésie on the coast of Adélie Land where they took some mineral, algae and animal samples.|$|E

5|$|Beeston crag {{is one of}} a chain <b>of</b> <b>rocky</b> hills {{stretching}} {{across the}} Cheshire Plain. Pits dating from the 4thmillennium BC indicate the site of Beeston Castle may have been inhabited or used as a communal gathering place during the Neolithic period. Archaeologists have discovered Neolithic flint arrow heads on the crag, as well as the remains of a Bronze Age community, and of an Iron Age hill fort. The rampart associated with the Bronze Age activity on the crag has been dated to around 1270–830 BC; seven circular buildings were identified as being either late Bronze Age or early Iron Age in origin. It may have been a specialist metalworking site.|$|E
5|$|Composed by Academy Award winner Bill Conti, the Rocky Balboa film {{score is}} both an updated {{composition}} <b>of</b> <b>Rocky</b> music and {{a tribute to the}} music that has been featured in previous Rocky films. Conti, who has acted as composer on every Rocky film except Rocky IV, chose to compose the score almost entirely from musical themes used in the previous movies.

5|$|The {{average density}} of Callisto, 1.83g/cm3, {{suggests}} a composition of approximately equal parts <b>of</b> <b>rocky</b> material and water ice, with some additional volatile ices such as ammonia. The mass fraction of ices is 49–55%. The exact composition of Callisto's rock component is not known, but is probably {{close to the}} composition of L/LL type ordinary chondrites, which are characterized by less total iron, less metallic iron and more iron oxide than H chondrites. The weight ratio of iron to silicon is 0.9–1.3 in Callisto, whereas the solar ratio is around 1:8.|$|E
