Mobile devices (e.g. smart phones) provide sufficient sensor data and calculation power to enable physical activity recognition to provide an estimation of the energy consumption during everyday life.

25|$|The moral {{influence}} {{view has}} historically come {{into conflict with}} a penal substitutionary view of atonement, as the two systems propose radically different criteria of salvation and judgment. The moral influence paradigm focuses on the moral change of people, leading to a positive final judgment for which the criteria focuses on inner moral character. By contrast, a penal substitutionary paradigm denies the saving value of human moral change. It focuses on faith in Christ and on his death <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>behalf,</b> leading to a positive final judgment based on what Christ has done for us and our trust in that - not on any positive moral qualities that we ourselves possess.|$|E
500|$|The second episode {{included}} {{the death of}} a main character. The idea was originally going {{to be used in the}} series finale. However, the producers did not know how to fill in episode two, so the death was moved up. According to Wolstencroft, the inclusion of Helen's death was to give the audience the message that [...] "the world of Spooks isn't the world where the cavalry always arrive, because in reality these people [...] do risk their lives <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>behalf</b> and they do get into sticky situations with genuinely nasty people." [...] The producers also wanted main characters to die on occasion rather than on a weekly or bi-weekly basis; otherwise it would show MI5 officers as not doing their jobs properly. Although Spooks is a serious show, the writers add occasional humour from the characters. According to Wolstencroft, he felt that anybody who works in such an occupation with high responsibilities tends to have humour around, and that those people make jokes even though they have seen [...] "heinous things". This became the basis for creating Jools Siviter.|$|E

5000|$|In the book, Dunham {{wrote about}} being sexually {{assaulted}} by an Oberlin College classmate, {{which resulted in}} controversy regarding the accuracy of her account and a {{case of mistaken identity}} when a former Oberlin College student named Barry (the pseudonym used for Dunham's alleged attacker in her book) sought legal advice to ensure people didn’t associate him with the content. In the book, Dunham describes “Barry” as a guy who wore cowboy boots, sported a mustache, hosted a radio show, worked at a campus library, and graduated Oberlin in 2005. According to the man’s attorney, Aaron Minc, that description warrants enough detail to point a finger at his client. Dunham later apologized for the confusion and Random House reprinted the book with a clarification, releasing a statement saying: [...] "Random House, <b>on</b> <b>our</b> own <b>behalf</b> and <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> of <b>our</b> author, regrets the confusion." ...|$|R

2500|$|Both leaders, Massoud and Haq, were {{recognized}} for being fiercely independent from foreign, especially Pakistani, influence. Both, {{two of the}} most successful anti-Soviet resistance leaders, were rejecting the Pakistani claim of hegemony over the Afghan mujahideen. Abdul Haq was quoted as saying during the anti-Soviet period: [...] "How is that we Afghans, who never lost a war, must take military instructions from the Pakistanis, who never won one?" [...] Massoud during the Soviet period said to the Pakistani Foreign Minister who had asked him {{to send a message to}} the Russians through the Pakistanis who were conducting talks [...] "on behalf of our Afghan brethren": [...] "Why should I send a message? Why are you talking <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>behalf?</b> Don't we have leaders here to talk on our behalf?" [...] Khan replied [...] "This is how it has been and how it will be. Do you have a message?" [...] Massoud told the foreign minister that [...] "nobody who talks <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>behalf</b> will have any kind of result." [...] Consequently, neither Massoud nor Abdul Haq were consulted before and neither participated in the Battle of Jalalabad (1989) in which the ISI tried but failed to install Gulbuddin Hekmatyar as the post-communist leader of Afghanistan.|$|E

40|$|Justification of a {{voluntary}} vaccination policy in England and Wales rests on tenuous foundations. Two arguments against voluntary vaccination are gaining ground. The {{first is that}} globalisation necessitates preparedness strategies for pandemics. Assuming sufficient supply, compulsory vaccination of adults and children constitutes a potential policy option {{in the context of}} a severe, vaccine-preventable pandemic outbreak. The second argument is that children have a right to preventative medicine and thus to vaccination. The influence of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and its emphasis on parents as the trustees of their children’s best interests, and the increasingly global nature of our collective and individual responsibilities with respect to the transmission of vaccine-preventable disease present challenges to the right to refuse vaccination <b>on</b> <b>our</b> own <b>behalf</b> and <b>on</b> <b>behalf</b> of <b>our</b> children. Exploring methods of compulsion and persuasion utilised across Europe, the United States and Australia, this article argues that necessity and proportionality must be reassessed and national public health law and policy setting out a graduated and proportionate approach to compulsory vaccination developed as a matter of priority...|$|R

2500|$|Having {{discovered}} that [...] "Great Britain had enemies beyond imagination," [...] Victoria decided {{to establish the}} Torchwood Institute in memory of Sir Robert (who lived on the Torchwood Estate). She also decided that the Doctor was dangerous and declared that if he ever returned, Torchwood would be waiting. The Doctor's name was written into the Torchwood Foundation's charter as {{an enemy of the}} Crown. Her Majesty states in the Torchwood Charter 31 December 1879 that [...] "Torchwood is also to administer to the Government thereof in our name, and generally to act in our name and <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>behalf,</b> subject to such orders and regulations as Torchwood shall, from time to time, receive from us through one of our Principal Secretaries of State". In 1882, Victoria expanded Torchwood's role to include the acquisition of alien technology, creating the policy that [...] "if it's alien, it's ours". In 1888, Victoria reiterated the secrecy policy of the Torchwood Institute, protecting her subjects from the [...] "evils that [...] fight". Not long after the foundation of the Institute, a spacetime rift was identified in Cardiff and as a result, a smaller branch of the Institute (Torchwood Three) was formed there to monitor and exploit the Rift.|$|E

He is responsible for what was my last association with a ship. I call it that be cause it can hardly be called a sea-going experience. Dear Captain Froud--it is impossible not to pay him the tribute of affectionate familiarity at this distance of years--had very sound views as to the advancement of knowledge and status for the whole body of the officers of the mercantile marine. He organized for us courses of professional lectures, St. John ambulance classes, corresponded industriously with public bodies and members of Parliament on subjects touching the interests of the service; and as to the oncoming of some inquiry or commission relating to matters of the sea and to the work of seamen, it was a perfect godsend to his need of exerting himself <b>on</b> <b>our</b> corporate <b>behalf.</b> Together with this high sense of his official duties he had in him a vein of personal kindness, a strong disposition to do what good he could to the individual members of that craft of which in his time he had been a very excellent master.

Captain Froud did not see why the Shipmasters' Society, besides its general guardianship of our interests, should not be unofficially an employment agency of the very highest class.|$|R
2500|$|... ("Why God was a Man") {{was written}} from 1095 to 1098 once Anselm was already {{archbishop}} of Canterbury {{as a response}} for requests to discuss the Incarnation. It {{takes the form of}} a dialogue between Anselm and Boso, one of his students. Its core is a purely rational argument for the necessity of the Christian mystery of atonement, the belief that Jesus's crucifixion was necessary to atone for mankind's sin. Anselm argues that, owing to the Fall and mankind's fallen nature ever since, humanity has offended God. Divine justice demands restitution for sin but human beings are incapable of providing it, as all the actions of men are already obligated to the furtherance of God's glory. Further, God's infinite justice demands infinite restitution for the impairment of his infinite dignity. The enormity of the offence led Anselm to reject personal acts of atonement, even Peter Damian's flagellation, as inadequate and ultimately vain. Instead, full recompense could only be made by God, which His infinite mercy inclines Him to provide. Atonement for humanity, however, could only be made through the figure of Jesus, as a sinless being both fully divine and fully human. Taking it upon himself to offer his own life <b>on</b> <b>our</b> <b>behalf,</b> his crucifixion accrues infinite worth, more than redeeming mankind and permitting it to enjoy a just will in accord with its intended nature. This interpretation is notable for permitting divine justice and mercy to be entirely compatible and has exercised immense influence over church doctrine, largely supplanting the earlier theory developed by Origen and Gregory of Nyssa that had focused primarily on Satan's power over fallen man. [...] is often accounted Anselm's greatest work, but the legalist and amoral nature of the argument, along with its neglect of the individuals actually being redeemed, has been criticized [...] both by comparison with the treatment by Abelard and for its subsequent development in Protestant theology.|$|E
