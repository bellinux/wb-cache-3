5|$|After Calabi–Yau {{manifolds}} {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification <b>of</b> <b>string</b> theory, {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two different versions <b>of</b> <b>string</b> theory called type IIA string theory and type IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E

50|$|The lid can be flexed, {{which will}} bend the pitch. While many {{stringed}} instruments can pitch bend, others bend along only one direction, altering {{the pitch of}} only a single set <b>of</b> <b>strings,</b> and by changing the tension <b>of</b> all <b>strings</b> together, their musical interval relationships stay constant.

40|$|Abstract. Abstraction <b>of</b> <b>strings,</b> that is {{grouping}} strings {{together and}} representing {{them in a}} compact way as patterns, {{can be useful in}} strings processing for stressing structure similarities among strings. In this pa-per, given a set <b>of</b> <b>strings,</b> we study how to obtain maximal abstractions in terms of maximal patterns, namely patterns which correspond to the largest subsets <b>of</b> <b>strings</b> which can be abstracted together. Intuitively such patterns represent all possible ”most abstract views ” <b>of</b> the <b>strings</b> in the given set. The number of maximal patterns of a set <b>of</b> <b>strings</b> is linear w. r. t. the number <b>of</b> <b>strings.</b> We propose an iterative algorithm for building all the maximal patterns of a set <b>of</b> <b>strings,</b> whose complex-ity is theoretically exponential w. r. t. the number <b>of</b> <b>strings,</b> but feasible in practice. The iterative nature of the algorithm can be exploited for strings analysis: at iteration j, the algorithm builds the set of all the maximal patterns with j abstract symbols, namely it groups strings by similarity with j points of symbol variance. Thus, it is possible to control both the amount of abstraction and the computational cost, by control-ling the number of iterations. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{theoretical}} physics, the anti-de Sitter/conformal {{field theory}} correspondence, sometimes called Maldacena duality or gauge/gravity duality, is a conjectured relationship between {{two kinds of}} physical theories. On one side are anti-de Sitter spaces (AdS) which are used in theories of quantum gravity, formulated in terms <b>of</b> <b>string</b> theory or M-theory. On {{the other side of}} the correspondence are conformal field theories (CFT) which are quantum field theories, including theories similar to the Yang–Mills theories that describe elementary particles.|$|E
5|$|One {{approach}} to formulating M-theory and studying its properties {{is provided by}} the anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. Proposed by Juan Maldacena in late 1997, the AdS/CFT correspondence is a theoretical result which implies that M-theory is in some cases equivalent to a quantum field theory. In addition to providing insights into the mathematical structure <b>of</b> <b>string</b> and M-theory, the AdS/CFT correspondence has shed light on many aspects of quantum field theory in regimes where traditional calculational techniques are ineffective.|$|E
5|$|One notable feature <b>of</b> <b>string</b> {{theory and}} M-theory {{is that these}} {{theories}} require extra dimensions of spacetime for their mathematical consistency.

5|$|String {{theory is}} a {{theoretical}} framework that attempts to reconcile gravity and quantum mechanics. In string theory, the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. In a given version <b>of</b> <b>string</b> theory, {{there is only one}} kind <b>of</b> <b>string,</b> which may look like a small loop or segment of ordinary string, and it can vibrate in different ways. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. In this way, all of the different elementary particles may be viewed as vibrating strings. One of the vibrational states of a string gives rise to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the seventeenth}} century, composers began {{creating}} works of a more emotional style. They felt that a monophonic style better suited the emotional music and wrote musical parts for instruments that would complement the singing human voice. As a result, many instruments that were incapable of larger ranges and dynamics, and therefore were seen as unemotional, fell out of favor. One such instrument was the shawm. Bowed instruments such as the violin, viola, baryton, and various lutes dominated popular music. Beginning in around 1750, however, the lute disappeared from musical compositions {{in favor of the}} rising popularity of the guitar.

Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry.
