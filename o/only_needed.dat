5|$|Intravenous hydration, if required, is {{typically}} <b>only</b> <b>needed</b> {{for one or}} two days. In children with shock due to dengue a rapid dose of 20mL/kg is reasonable. The rate of fluid administration is than titrated to a urinary output of 0.5–1mL/kg/h, stable vital signs and normalization of hematocrit. The smallest amount of fluid required to achieve this is recommended.|$|E

The shooting was the second firearm-related incident on Pine Middle School grounds in two weeks, with the previous incident being a man brandishing a gun towards the campus. On that occasion school administrators sent students home as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|An {{electroencephalogram}} (EEG) {{can assist}} in showing brain activity suggestive of {{an increased risk of}} seizures. It is only recommended for those who are likely to have had an epileptic seizure on the basis of symptoms. In the diagnosis of epilepsy, electroencephalography may help distinguish the type of seizure or syndrome present. In children it is typically <b>only</b> <b>needed</b> after a second seizure. It cannot be used to rule out the diagnosis and may be falsely positive in those without the disease. In certain situations it may be useful to perform the EEG while the affected individual is sleeping or sleep deprived.|$|E

5|$|As {{both teams}} {{were in the}} highest tier of English football, the Premier League, Arsenal and Manchester United entered the {{competition}} in the third round. Matches up to the semi-final were contested on a one-off basis, with a replay taking place if the match ended in a draw. Both clubs <b>only</b> <b>needed</b> one replay {{along the way to}} the final; Arsenal's tie against Sheffield United in the fifth round was decided by a penalty shootout, whereas Manchester United overcame non-league Exeter City in the third round, after the original tie ended goalless.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} May 1945, the {{division}} was pulled out of Germany and returned to England. It was initially intended {{to send them to}} India to form an airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. The division’s advance party, formed around the 5th Parachute Brigade, had already arrived in India. Following the Japanese surrender, all these plans changed. The post-war British Army <b>only</b> <b>needed</b> one airborne division, and the 6th Airborne was chosen to remain on strength. Reinforced by the 2nd Parachute Brigade, {{the division}} was sent to the Middle East as the Imperial Strategic Reserve.|$|E
5|$|For Vorticons, Carmack {{had created}} {{adaptive}} tile refresh {{to produce a}} scrolling effect on computers not powerful enough to redraw the entire screen when the player moved. For Keen Dreams, he wanted to scroll the background at a different rate than the foreground, but again computers of the time were not powerful enough to do so smoothly. To implement parallax scrolling without having to manage all of the elements moving past each other, {{he came up with}} a plan to instead save combinations of overlapping foreground and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game <b>only</b> <b>needed</b> to pick the correct image rather than recalculate what that image would be.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, for {{the first}} time, Justice Commissioner Franco Frattini {{included}} Parliament in talks on the second Schengen Information System even though MEPs <b>only</b> <b>needed</b> to be consulted on parts of the package. After that experiment, Frattini indicated {{he would like to}} include Parliament in all justice and criminal matters, informally pre-empting the new powers they could gain as part of the Treaty of Lisbon. Between 2007 and 2009, a special working group on parliamentary reform implemented a series of changes to modernise the institution such as more speaking time for rapporteurs, increase committee co-operation and other efficiency reforms.|$|E
5|$|In the 2002–03 season, {{the team}} was relegated again to second division, winning the {{championship}} of that division the following year and promoted again to first division. The 2004–05 season saw the squad finish sixth. With its stadium closed for repairs, the team played at Antonis Papadopoulos Stadium (except for two games at Makario Stadium). Nea Salamina returned to Ammochostos Stadium for the 2005–06 season, again finishing sixth. It finished 10th in the 2006–07 season and 13th in 2007–08, again relegated to the second division. After a difficult season in 2008–09, the team returned to first division, winning in the final game and leaving opponents Olympiacos, who <b>only</b> <b>needed</b> a draw to win the promotion, in the second division.|$|E
5|$|On special teams, the Hokies {{had several}} highs and lows. Justin Harper's 84-yard punt-return {{touchdown}} sparked a Virginia Tech rally {{that brought the}} Hokies within striking distance, but failures on special teams also ended the rally and turned {{the momentum of the}} game against Virginia Tech. Kicker Jud Dunlevy had been the third-most accurate kicker in the nation heading into the Orange Bowl, having hit 21 of his 24field goal attempts during the season. He <b>only</b> <b>needed</b> two field goals to break Tech's record for most field goals in the season, set at 22 by Shayne Graham in 1998. Though Dunlevy had two chances for field goals, one fell short and the other was blocked.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Ginsberg's conviction, {{ruling that}} the New York State Legislature was not {{required}} to prove a tangible negative impact on youth from exposure to sexually explicit material. The Court said the New York State Legislature <b>only</b> <b>needed</b> to assume that such an impact existed. Justice William O. Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in the case, criticizing the New York law. He concluded he knew individuals who fit the definition of juvenile delinquent but were fifty years old, and extrapolated {{the impact of the}} decision could be expanded to affect adults and multiple organizations in society instead of just youths.|$|E
5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit <b>only</b> <b>needed</b> to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from his invention.|$|E
5|$|During {{the next}} two seasons Liverpool {{consolidated}} {{their place in the}} First Division, with fifth and ninth-place finishes. Performances improved in the 1898–99 season, when the club went into their final game with a chance of winning their first League championship. They faced Aston Villa, with whom they were level on points, although Villa's goal average advantage of 0.02 meant that they <b>only</b> <b>needed</b> to draw the match to win the League title. In the event, Villa won 5–0, to leave Liverpool as the runners-up. Liverpool also reached the FA Cup semi-final, where they faced Sheffield United. The match finished in a 2–2 draw; the first replay at Burnden Park also finished with the sides equal at 4–4, and a second replay at the small Fallowfield Stadium was abandoned when overcrowding caused fans to spill onto the pitch. The tie was finally decided at the Baseball Ground, which Sheffield United won 1–0.|$|E

5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} is <b>only</b> <b>needed</b> {{if a person}} is showing signs of a severe allergic reaction. Prior to calling for help, stung persons should be laid down, and their legs elevated. An EpiPen or an Anapen is given to people at risk of anaphylaxis, to use in case they are stung. If someone experiences anaphylactic shock, adrenaline and intravenous infusions are required, and those who suffer cardiac arrest require resuscitation. Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) is offered to those who are susceptible to M. pilosula stings, and the program has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis. However, the standardisation of M. pilosula venom is not validated, and the program is poorly funded. The Royal Hobart Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital are the only known hospitals to run desensitisation programs. During immunotherapy, patients are given an injection of venom under the skin. The first dose is small, but dosage gradually increases. This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} race, Ferrari driver Michael Schumacher led the Drivers' Championship with 88 points, ahead of Mika Häkkinen on 80 points and David Coulthard on 63. Rubens Barrichello was fourth on 55 points, with Ralf Schumacher fifth on 24 points. A maximum of 20 points were {{available}} for the final two races, which meant Häkkinen could still win the title. Michael Schumacher <b>only</b> <b>needed</b> to clinch victory in the race, regardless of where Häkkinen finished, Schumacher {{would be more than}} ten points ahead of Häkkinen with one race remaining. Otherwise, Häkkinen could win the Championship in the final race of the season in Malaysia by out-scoring his rival. In the event of a points tie, Michael Schumacher would win the Championship on count-back, having more wins. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari were leading on 143 points, McLaren and Williams were second and third on 133 and 34 points respectively, while Benetton with 20 and Jordan with 17 contended for fourth place. Championship drivers Barrichello and Giancarlo Fisichella had each gained second-place finishes while Ralf Schumacher and Heinz-Harald Frentzen had both achieved third place podium finishes.|$|E
5|$|If morning {{cortisol}} {{levels are}} over 500nmol/l, ACTH deficiency is unlikely, whereas a level less than 100 is indicative. Levels between 100-500 require a stimulation test. This, too, {{is done with}} the insulin tolerance test. A cortisol level above 500 after achieving a low blood sugar rules out ACTH deficiency, while lower levels confirm the diagnosis. A similar stimulation test using corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) is not sensitive enough {{for the purposes of}} the investigation. If the insulin tolerance test yields an abnormal result, a further test measuring the response of the adrenal glands to synthetic ACTH (the ACTH stimulation test) can be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Stimulation testing with metyrapone is an alternative. Some suggest that an ACTH stimulation test is sufficient as first-line investigation, and that an insulin tolerance test is <b>only</b> <b>needed</b> if the ACTH test is equivocal. The insulin tolerance test is discouraged in children. None of the tests for ACTH deficiency are perfect, and further tests after a period of time may be needed if initial results are not conclusive.|$|E
