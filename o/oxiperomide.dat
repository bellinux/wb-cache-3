40|$|<b>Oxiperomide,</b> a new dopamine-receptor antagonist, {{was found}} to {{decrease}} dyskinesias in patients with Parkinson's disease receiving levodopa or other dopamine agonists without necessarily increasing Parkinsonian symptoms. <b>Oxiperomide</b> also decreased spontaneous dyskinesias in those with tics and chorea and {{to a less extent}} in those with torsion dystonia, without necessarily causing Parkinsonism. These results provide evidence that more than one population of dopamine receptors exist in the extra pyramidal system, and encourage the search for selective dopamine antagonists...|$|E
40|$|Tardive {{dyskinesia}} can be {{suppressed by}} dopaminergic receptor blockers, but {{often at the}} cost of a reciprocal increase in Parkinsonism. <b>Oxiperomide,</b> a dopaminergic antagonist that has been shown to reduce levodopa-induced dyskinesias without producing an equal aggravation of Parkinsonism, was evaluated in a blind placebo-controlled trial in 10 patients with tardive dyskinesia. It decreased tardive dyskinesia significantly (p less than 0. 01) without significantly provoking or increasing Parkinsonism. There was no relationship between either tardive dyskinesia or Parkinsonism and eye blinking rates. These results can be interpreted as additional evidence for the existence of more than one population of dopamine receptors involved in controlling extrapyramidal function. Although <b>oxiperomide</b> is only a palliative suppressing agent in tardive dyskinesia, as the symptoms returned when the drug was stopped, it is an interesting agent in the search for selective dopaminergic receptor blockers...|$|E
40|$|Separate {{groups of}} rats {{were trained to}} {{discriminate}} the narcotic agonist-antagonist, cyclazocine (1. 25 mg/kg), from saline or the pure narcotic agonist, morphine (10 mg/kg), from saline. In the cyclazocine discriminating animals, the interoceptive stimuli produced by cyclazocine {{were found to be}} dose related and largely based on central opiate systems in that these effects were reversed by the narcotic antagonist, naloxone. The discriminative stimulus produced by cyclazocine was found to be completely generalized to nalorphine, ethylketocyclazocine, pentazocine and morphine while a lesser degree of generalization was seen to the experimental compounds, U- 49, 274 A and U- 50, 788 E. The cyclazocine discriminative stimulus did not generalize to apomorphine, d-amphetamine, haloperidol, d-butaclamol, 1 -butaclamol, clonidine, desipramine, amitriptyline, aceperone and butorphanol. Cyclazocine generalization to morphine was completely antagonized by naloxone at a dose one-twentieth that required to antagonize the cyclazocine discriminative stimulus itself. At no dose tested did naloxone completely antagonize cyclazocine generalization to nalorphine. A possible dopaminergic component of the cyclazocine discriminative stimulus was demonstrated by attenuation of stimulus strength with the neuroleptics haloperidol, benperidol and d-butaclamol. The discriminative stimulus produced by morphine was also found to be a dose related effect based upon central opiate mechanisms as demonstrated by naloxone reversibility. The discriminative stimulus produced by morphine only partially generalized to cyclazocine and ethylketocyclazocine. Naloxone antagonized the generalization of morphine to cyclazocine but at a dose four times that required to antagonize the morphine discriminative stimulus itself. A possible dopaminergic component of the morphine discriminative stimulus was demonstrated by haloperidol attenuation of stimulus strength. Cyclazocine analgesia, demonstrated using the mouse tail flick procedure, was found to be maximal approximately five minutes following cyclazocine administration. Some analgesic potency was also ~easurable 35 minutes post cyclazocine. The analgesic effects of cyclazocine were found to be reversed by naloxone. Pretreatment with the neuroleptics <b>oxiperomide,</b> clozapine and dexclamol before cyclazocine was found to enhance the analgesic potency of cyclazocine...|$|E
40|$|Narcotic {{dependence}} {{was established}} by continuous intravenous infusion of gradually increasing doses of morphine. Several days at the terminal concentration of morphine (100 mg/kg/day) was allowed prior to withdrawal. Morphine withdrawal body shakes were reliably observed upon the termination of continuous morphine infusion. The administration of morphine, methadone or _fentanyl, potent narcotic drugs, reliably abolished the occurrence of withdrawal body shakes 8 hours after the termination of morphine infusion. The narcotic antagonist naloxone or pentazocine had no {{significant effect on the}} rate of occurrence of withdrawal body shakes; however, there was a slight trend towards an increase in the frequency of this withdrawal index. A wide variety of neuroleptics were investigated for their ability to reduce withdrawal. The order of potency for reduction of withdrawal body shakes on a mg/kg basis for those neuroleptics tested was spiperone, benperidol, butaclarriol, loxapine, <b>oxiperomide,</b> haloperidol, spiramide, chlorpromazine, trifluoperazine, pimozide and pipamperone. The dopaminergic agonists amphetamine, apomorphine and L-IX 3 ̆ePA were also found to dose dependently reduce withdrawal• body shakes. Azaperone, a butyrophenone possessing high alpha noradrenergic blocking potency, reduces withdrawal body shakes in a dose related manner, while the alpha adrenergic blocker phenoxybenzamine and the beta adrenergic blocker propronalol failed to reduce withdrawal shakes to any significant extent. Dose dependent decreases in morphine withdrawal body shakes were produced by clonidine and desmethylimipramine, adrenergic agonists. Reserpine and alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine also reduced withdrawal shakes, but the effect was dose dependent for only reserpine. The serotoninergic agents fluoxetine, 5 -HTP and methysergide were without effect on the occurrence of withdrawal body shakes at the doses tested. A slight but non-significant increase in the rate of withdrawal shakes was observed after the administration of the anticholinergic drugs atropine, benztropine, dexetimide and scopolamine. Conversely, the cholinergic agonists physostigmine and pilocarpine, reduced withdrawal body shakes in a dose related fashion. Modification of gabaminergic system by the administration of bicuculline, depakene and picrotoxin had no significant effect. Chlordiazepoxide, flurazepam and pentobarbital, sedativehypnotic agents, did not produce dose dependent effects on the occurrence of withdrawal shakes. However, the highest dose of each sedative hypnotic employed did reduce withdrawal body shakes. The exact mechanism by which neuroleptics reduce withdrawal is not known. Manipulation of each of the transmitters effect by neuroleptics indicates that dopamine and acetylcholine are involved in mediating the reduction in withdrawal body shakes. The fact that the antiwithdrawal activity of certain neuroleptics is reversed by the narcotic antagonist naloxone implicates opiate receptor mechanisms. However, not all neuroleptics were antagonized by naloxone, suggesting that neuroleptics may be working at more than one site to reduce withdrawal. Thus neuroleptics may be reducing withdrawal body shakes by several different mechanisms. The data gathered from these studies suggest a role for cholinergic, dopaminergic and narcotic mechanisms in the antiwithdrawal activity of neuroleptic drugs...|$|E
