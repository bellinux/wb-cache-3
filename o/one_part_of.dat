5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman animals have failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just <b>one</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E

5|$|Cultivated plant {{taxonomy}} is <b>one</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{the study of}} horticultural botany which is mostly carried out in botanical gardens, large nurseries, universities, or government departments. Areas of special interest for the cultivated plant taxonomist include: searching for and recording new plants suitable for cultivation (plant hunting); communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and nomenclature of cultivated plants and carrying out original research on these topics; describing the cultivated plants of particular regions (horticultural floras); maintaining databases, herbaria and other information about cultivated plants.|$|E

5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just <b>one</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure his throne.|$|E

The process was also designed to make identification of the brigades easier. It was assigned to Division East of the First Army.

5|$|The {{atmosphere}} is a chaotic system. As a result, small changes to <b>one</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{the system can}} accumulate and magnify to cause large effects on {{the system as a}} whole. This atmospheric instability makes weather forecasting less predictable than tides or eclipses. Although it is difficult to accurately predict weather {{more than a few days}} in advance, weather forecasters are continually working to extend this limit through meteorological research and refining current methodologies in weather prediction. However, it is theoretically impossible to make useful day-to-day predictions more than about two weeks ahead, imposing an upper limit to potential for improved prediction skill.|$|E

5|$|A {{contingent}} of 250 National Guard engineering units occupied <b>one</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> {{the convention center}} beginning August 30 and remained there until September 1, at times barricaded in their location. The units were never given orders to control the crowd, and were {{not expected to be}} prepared for such a task, as engineering units. The number of people at the convention center continued to grow over the next three days by some estimates to as many as 20,000people. Reasons for arriving included being sent to the convention center from the overwhelmed Superdome, being dropped off there by rescuers, or hearing about the convention center as a shelter via word of mouth. No checking for weapons was done among the crowd as was done at the Superdome, and a large store of alcohol kept at the Convention Center was looted. Reports of robberies, murder, and rape began to surface. In general, those who died, regardless of cause of death, were not moved or removed and were left to decompose.|$|E
5|$|At {{the urging}} of Butler's father, in 1924, the newly elected mayor of Philadelphia W. Freeland Kendrick asked {{him to leave the}} Marines to become the Director of Public Safety, the {{official}} in charge of running the city's police and fire departments. Philadelphia's municipal government was notoriously corrupt and Butler initially refused. Kendrick asked President Calvin Coolidge to intervene. Coolidge contacted Butler and authorized him to take the necessary leave from the Corps. At the request of the president, Butler served in the post from January 1924 until December 1925. He began his new job by assembling all 4,000 of the city police into the Metropolitan Opera House in shifts to introduce himself and inform them that things would change while he was in charge. He replaced corrupt police officers and, in some cases, switched entire units from <b>one</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the city to another, undermining local protection rackets and profiteering.|$|E
5|$|Colbourn {{established}} the university's honors program, {{and started the}} university's first satellite branch campus. In addition, Colbourn was responsible for constructing the Central Florida Research Park, located adjacent to the UCF campus and founded in 1978. The park serves as {{a major focus of}} simulation for space and defense-related research. The park was <b>one</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> Colbourn's plan to make UCF a world-class partnership university. Among the university's first partners were Lockheed Martin and the United States Navy, and Colbourn led the push to found both the Institute for Simulation and Training and the Center for Research and Education in Optics and Lasers in 1986. During his tenure, enrollment increased from 11,000 in 1978 to over 18,000 in 1989. However, Colbourn's most notable accomplishments as president were supporting the young university's athletic programs. He was responsible for establishing the school's football program in 1979, which began an era of growth for the university. In April 1979, UCF awarded its 15,000th degree.|$|E

5|$|Concurrent {{programming}} languages, libraries, APIs, {{and parallel}} programming models (such as algorithmic skeletons) {{have been created}} for programming parallel computers. These can generally be divided into classes based on the assumptions they make about the underlying memory architecture—shared memory, distributed memory, or shared distributed memory. Shared memory programming languages communicate by manipulating shared memory variables. Distributed memory uses message passing. POSIX Threads and OpenMP {{are two of the}} most widely used shared memory APIs, whereas Message Passing Interface (MPI) is the most widely used message-passing system API. One concept used in programming parallel programs is the future concept, where <b>one</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a program promises to deliver a required datum to another part of a program at some future time.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{neurological}} disorders after stroke, and affects at least 50million people worldwide. It is diagnosed in a person having recurrent unprovoked seizures. These occur when cortical neurons fire excessively, hypersynchronously, or both, leading to temporary disruption of normal brain function. This might affect, for example, the muscles, the senses, consciousness, or a combination. A seizure can be focal (confined to <b>one</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the brain) or generalised (spread widely throughout the brain and leading to a loss of consciousness). Epilepsy may occur for a variety of reasons; some forms have been classified into epileptic syndromes, most of which begin in childhood. Epilepsy is considered refractory (not yielding to treatment) when two or three anticonvulsant drugs have failed to control it. About 60% of patients will achieve control of their epilepsy with the first drug they use, whereas about 30% do not achieve control with drugs. When drugs fail, other options include epilepsy surgery, vagus nerve stimulation and the ketogenic diet.|$|E
5|$|Ideas {{about the}} {{transmutation}} of species {{were associated with}} the radical materialism of the Enlightenment and were attacked by more conservative thinkers. Cuvier attacked the ideas of Lamarck and Geoffroy, agreeing with Aristotle that species were immutable. Cuvier believed that the individual parts of an animal were too closely correlated with one another to allow for <b>one</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the anatomy to change in isolation from the others, and argued that the fossil record showed patterns of catastrophic extinctions followed by repopulation, rather than gradual change over time. He also noted that drawings of animals and animal mummies from Egypt, which were thousands of years old, showed no signs of change when compared with modern animals. The strength of Cuvier's arguments and his scientific reputation helped keep transmutational ideas out of the mainstream for decades.|$|E
