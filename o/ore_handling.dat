40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{structures and}} principles of a fast stockpile simulation engine that enhances automatic material process by providing accurate digital information of material quality distribution within stockpiles. Compared with traditional measurement-based approaches, our simulation technology reduces operation cost by eliminating frequent physical measuring; improves operation accuracy through all-time whole-area contour simulation (instead of measuring a few positions of material layers now and then); and speeds the process through fast simulation and instant response to quality information query. Based on simplified grain dynamics and cellular automata models, the technology can achieve real-time/super-real-time simulation, which is critical to be adopted by the industry. Application of the technology in analyzing mineral <b>ores</b> <b>handling</b> is also discussed. Tien-Fu Lu and Shihong X...|$|R

50|$|In September 1848 the miners, {{who were}} paid on the tribute system, {{went on strike}} over the way assay of their <b>ore</b> was <b>handled.</b> After a week, {{management}} met the strikers; Police were on hand but the meeting was orderly and the dispute was settled amicably. A few weeks later, management announced that wages of labourers and carters were to be reduced to 21s. per week, well below what had attracted them to Burra. This especially drew the ire of family men, who were already struggling with the hardships and high living expenses of Burra.

40|$|The {{degradation}} {{characteristics of}} various ores and coal types due to particle breakage {{have been studied}} {{by a number of}} researchers to determine the causes of degradation and its prevention during the handling process from mines to end users. They have used several drop tests to determine the degradation characteristics of each ore and coal such as: critical drop height tests; cushioning tests; different types of impact surface tests; different sample sizes tests; stabilization tests; weathering tests and volume breakage index tests. Researchers have also used a tumbler drum test to measure the attrition or abrasion properties of the material during handling. This review highlights that the fines generation increases during transport from mines to end users due to more large vertical drops, replacing the larger vertical drops with smaller drop heights reduces the fines generation, the cushioning effects with initial fines reduce the degradation of lump size <b>ore</b> during <b>handling,</b> the different impact surfaces have different degradation characteristics, the stabilized ore produced less percentage of fines than the normal <b>ore</b> during <b>handling</b> and the rate of fines generation of coal increases with the period of weathering. The rate of degradation is higher in larger lump size coal compared to smaller lump size. The lump coal dropped from lower heights does not follow a first order breakage process behavior. Volume breakage decreases with the increases of the sample mass. A degradation model was developed with several parameters to predict the total fines generation of bulk materials during handling. The model has the following dimensionless parameters: height parameter, cushioning parameter, surface parameter, stabilization parameter and weathering parameter...|$|R

The water extracted from the ore by dewatering is recirculated for plant operations after being sent to a water treatment plant. The main processes that are used in dewatering include dewatering screens such as Sepro-Sizetec Screens, sedimentation, filtering, and thermal drying. These processes increase in difficulty and cost as the particle size decreases.|$|E

40|$|In many {{mining and}} {{industrial}} processes where {{large quantities of}} non-degrading bulk materials such as crushed <b>ores</b> are <b>handled,</b> silos, hoppers, stockpiles and chutes are widely used because they are economical and reliable (if properly designed and operated). However, they are not free of trouble and may experience flow problems such as arching, ratholing, erratic flow, limited storage capacity, limited discharge flow rate, caking, segregation and/or flooding. Moisture content and fine particles significantly affect the flowability of most ores, increasing their cohesive strength and turning them more prone to these problems. The {{purpose of this article}} is to highlight a proven, scientific method that can be utilized to ensure reliable storage, flow and discharge of bulk solids in these equipment based on Jenike’s flow-of-solids theory and laboratory testing. Knowledge of the flow properties of the material handled provides a design basis to ensure mass flow, avoid arching and prevent the formation of “ratholes”. The effect of an increase in water content of the ore is discussed with experimental results...|$|R
50|$|During early operations, ore {{was loaded}} into Southern Pacific gondola and open-top hopper cars of 50-, 60- and 70-ton capacity. Starting in 1958, these cars were {{replaced}} by about 700 closed-bottom 100-ton ore cars. This cars were constructed by Southern Pacific at its Sacramento, California, shops. During the 1960s, these cars were modified to give them increased height, needed to carry pelletized ore (which was less dense) and this increased car loadings to 108 tons. From the early 1960s until the early 1970s, two loaded 100-car trains left the mine each day, seven days a week. One train carried the iron ore needed for the Fontana Mill while the second train <b>handled</b> <b>ore</b> to Long Beach, California, where it was shipped to oversea steel mills.|$|R
50|$|The International Smelting and Refining Company was a {{subsidiary}} of Anaconda Copper which operated primarily out of the International Smelter near Tooele, Utah.

50|$|The {{economy in}} the {{community}} continues to heavily reflect that of the lumber industry. The two mills Weyerhaeuser and Slocan-Canfor were positioned {{side by side on}} the north side of the river until, in 2002, Weyerhaeuser shut down its Vavenby operation choosing to focus on other locations in western Canada. This resulted in a significant depletion of employment in the region and a rapid population reduction. Weyerhaeuser retained logging rights in the area, keeping the local loggers and foresters employed. In 2004, a finger jointing mill proposed purchase of the Weyerhaeuser, Vavenby mill property and was scheduled to begin production, but the company went bankrupt before the plant became fully operational. The region has been showing signs of economic recovery though. The Canfor mill which had been indefinitely closed in 2009 due to poor market conditions reopened in September 2011 after $24 million in capital upgrades, and in January 2012 it added a second shift for a total of 145 jobs restored to the local region. Yellow Head Mining Corp began exploration in 2007 of the Harper Creek Mine project sited on Harper Mountain approximately 10 km south of town. The Environmental Assessment stage continued through 2013. Yellow Head Mining Corp also purchased the old Weyerhaeuser mill site as an <b>ore</b> <b>handling</b> facility in 2012.|$|E

40|$|Economic drives {{dictate the}} {{exploitation}} of formerly less attractive ore bodies located close to or even beneath the water table. These <b>ores</b> can cause <b>handling</b> problems and expensive downtime of processing equipment due to their increased adhesive characteristics and are colloquially termed as "wet and sticky" ores. In order {{to gain a better}} understanding of the causes of poor performance in the handling process, experimental test methods for adhesion and cohesion within bulk solids samples were developed and validated. The results confirmed that adhesion of bulk solid to equipment surfaces is mainly governed by capillary pressure. It can therefore be described using the Young-Laplace equation, which implies that adhesion is primarily dependent on the interfacial water between bulk material and the adhesion partner. Accordingly, the governing material parameters of adhesion are its capillarity and permeability, as these two characterize water transport to or from the interface of the adhesion partners. Furthermore a threshold for the classification of a material as wet and sticky based on the measurements of adhesion and cohesion has been proposed...|$|R
