5|$|Although {{capable of}} {{generating}} a high volume of fire, autocannon {{are limited by}} the amount <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, to extend {{the amount of time}} they can be employed on a battlefield before requiring a resupply <b>of</b> <b>ammunition.</b> The rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels—Gatling guns—can have rates of fire of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the GSh-6-30K, which has a rate of fire of over 6,000rounds per minute.|$|E
50|$|Private {{firearms}} must {{be registered}} {{at the local}} police department within 72 hours <b>of</b> acquisition. <b>Ammunition</b> purchases must also be registered, and possession is normally limited to 200 rounds <b>of</b> handgun <b>ammunition</b> and 1500 rounds <b>of</b> hunting <b>ammunition.</b>|$|R
50|$|Ammunition is also regulated. While each {{licensed}} {{individual can}} keep 1500 rounds <b>of</b> hunting <b>ammunition,</b> only 200 rounds <b>of</b> handgun <b>ammunition</b> are allowed. A license to store additional 1500 rounds <b>of</b> pistol <b>ammunition</b> can be obtained, provided specific requirements are met. Ammunition purchases {{must also be}} registered.|$|R
50|$|At least 9 {{people having}} links with group behind the attack have been apprehend. A large amount <b>of</b> <b>ammunitions,</b> and maps <b>of</b> {{sensitive}} installations were recovered.|$|R
5|$|By 04:00 on 1June, the German fleet had evaded the British {{fleet and}} reached Horns Reef; the Germans then {{returned}} to port. In {{the course of the}} battle, Stettin had suffered eight men killed and another 28 wounded. She had fired a total of 81 rounds <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> from her 10.5cm guns.|$|E
5|$|Each {{soldier in}} the first two waves had been issued a total of 200 rounds <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> for his rifle, along with rations for one day, and {{miscellaneous}} equipment including a gas mask. The third wave had received the same amount <b>of</b> <b>ammunition,</b> but was also issued entrenching equipment that would be used to construct positions to defend the initial gains against the inevitable Ottoman counterattack. In support, each battalion had four Vickers medium machine-guns, which had been issued with 3,500 rounds, and contributed a platoon whose job would be to throw the 1,200 grenades that the brigade had been allocated for the attack. A small section of engineers was also allocated to undertake demolitions.|$|E

50|$|In March 2008 {{the problem}} of massive amounts <b>of</b> excess <b>ammunition</b> stockpiled in Albania became known to the public through the tragic {{consequences}} of the explosion <b>of</b> an <b>ammunition</b> depot (the 2008 Tirana explosions).|$|R
5|$|In {{terms of}} war materiel, Massachusetts, {{as a leading}} center of {{industry}} and manufacturing, was poised to become a major producer <b>of</b> <b>ammunitions</b> and supplies. The most important source of armaments in Massachusetts was the Springfield Armory.|$|R
5|$|Includes full {{automatic}} firearms, military firearms and ammunition not inspected and marked for civilian use, some types <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> such as armor-piercing and incendiary ammunition, night vision scopes, suppressors. The use of hollow point ammunition in pistols is also restricted, however, hollow points are legal to purchase for rifles and pistol carbines.|$|E
5|$|Indeed, the {{evacuation}} of casualties and the resupply <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> at times proved problematic, and heavy shelling and sniper fire disrupted stretcher parties and porters {{on a number of}} occasions, resulting in the forward companies running short <b>of</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Meanwhile, the quality of support given to the British and Australian infantry by the artillery and tanks was of a high standard and proved a critical factor. Indeed, the tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited, while the New Zealand gunners had fired over 50,000 rounds in direct support of 3 RAR, blistering the paint off the barrels of their guns. Air support, including that provided by the South African Mustangs, had been important throughout.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, 5 Platoon was in dire straits and was {{beginning}} to run low <b>of</b> <b>ammunition,</b> while a number of its M60 machine-guns were also beginning to fail because of the prolonged firing. Moving to outflank the heavily outnumbered Australians, Viet Cong were observed emerging from their bunkers. Indeed, only heavy indirect fire and effective suppressing fire from helicopter gunships prevented them from being overrun. Attempting {{to gain a better}} position to direct the fire, the B Company Forward Observer, Lieutenant Ian Mathers, moved forward to 5 Platoon, and was killed almost immediately. However, by 09:15 the remainder of B Company was able to link up with the beleaguered platoon, and after an aerial resupply <b>of</b> <b>ammunition,</b> stabilised the situation temporarily.|$|E

5|$|The large caliber {{guns were}} {{designed}} to fire two different 16-inch shells: an armor-piercing round for anti-ship and anti-structure work and a high explosive round designed for use against unarmored targets and shore bombardment.

5|$|There {{were two}} {{other reasons for}} the Syrian withdrawal. The 3rd Battalion from the Palmach's Yiftach Brigade had been sent by boat during the {{previous}} night across the sea to Ein Gev, planning to assault and capture Kafr Harib. It was, noticed and shelled by the Syrians, {{but one of the}} companies managed to climb up the Golan. It carried out a smaller raid at dawn, bombing water carriers and threatening the Syrian 1st Brigade's line of communications. The second reason was that they were running out of ammunition: Husni al-Za'im had been promised replenishment, and attacked Degania short <b>of</b> <b>ammunition.</b> Za'im ordered a withdrawal when his troops ran out <b>of</b> <b>ammunition.</b> The replenishment was instead sent to the 2nd Brigade further north. The Israelis were not aware of this, and attributed the Syrian withdrawal to surprise at the Israeli artillery fire.|$|E
50|$|As {{part of the}} {{development}} <b>of</b> Central <b>Ammunition</b> Depot Nesscliffe in World War II, an ammunition depot was built beneath Loton Park.

5|$|As {{part of the}} Lend Lease agreement, between October 1941 and March 1946 the Soviet Union was {{supplied}} with 1,000 PIATs and 100,000 rounds <b>of</b> <b>ammunition.</b> The PIAT was also utilized by resistance groups in Occupied Europe. During the Warsaw Uprising, {{it was one of}} many weapons that Polish Underground resistance fighters used against German forces. And in occupied France, the French resistance used the PIAT in the absence of mortars or artillery.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on September 5 the North Koreans attacked. The {{engineers}} repulsed {{this attack}} but suffered some casualties. Ammunition was running low and three US C-47 Skytrain aircraft {{came over the}} area to make an airdrop. The planes mistakenly dropped their bundles <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> and food on the North Korean positions. Immediately after the airdrops, two F-51 Mustang fighter planes came over and attacked D Company, also in error. Soon after this aerial attack, North Korean troops attacked the positions.|$|E
5|$|Baxter's brigade {{was worn}} {{down and out}} <b>of</b> <b>ammunition.</b> At 3:00 p.m. he withdrew his brigade, and Gen. Robinson {{replaced}} it with the brigade of Brig. Gen. Gabriel R. Paul. Rodes then committed his two reserve brigades: Brig. Gens. Junius Daniel and Dodson Ramseur. Ramseur attacked first, but Paul's brigade held its crucial position. Paul had a bullet go in one temple and out the other, blinding him permanently (he survived the wound and lived 20 more years after the battle). Before {{the end of the}} day, three other commanders of that brigade were wounded.|$|E

5|$|Billy Clanton {{was shot}} in the wrist, chest and abdomen, and after a minute or two slumped to a sitting {{position}} near his original position {{at the corner of the}} MacDonald house in the lot between the house and Fly's Lodging House. Claiborne said Clanton was supported by a window initially after he was shot, and fired some shots after sitting, with the pistol supported on his leg. After he ran out <b>of</b> <b>ammunition,</b> he called for more cartridges, but C. S. Fly took his pistol at about the time the general shooting ended.|$|E
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds <b>of</b> <b>ammunition</b> from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary Grenade (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 Grenade (an anti-tank grenade resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E
