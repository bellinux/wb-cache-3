40|$|Developments in globalization, market economy, competition, specialization, {{information}} and communication technologies andfactors as rapidly changing economic, social, cultural and political conditions oblige decision makers to access the correct informationduring their decision making processes. Under these conditions, ones who access the most correct information in the shortest periodhave the chance to live and to sustain their existence in the market (Hacırüstemoğlu, 2008; 4). Organizations require marketing operationson strategically and sufficient levels to sustain and maintain their existence {{for a long period of}} time. This obligation leads organizations todevelop new policies and strategies in today’s information-based competitive environment. This is possible only with promptly,convenient and trustable information. Information lack of these properties leads to make strategically wrong decisions. Therefore, sinceproblems caused by wrong decisions emerged from insufficient and misleading information, can not be solved through short termmarketing measures, efficient use of information management becomes significant for strategic marketing. The basic reason to strengthenthe relationship among the management functions of marketing and accounting is marketing problems. Quantitative and qualitativeinformation is required to solve problems arise with strategic reasons. In this respect, meeting the required information in sufficient levelis due to the fact that these functions interactively work with each other. The function of information preparation for strategic marketingoperations can only be executed through the help of the relationship among the Marketing Information System (MIS) -AccountingInformation System (AIS) in general, and in particular it can be executed by using the Strategic Management Accounting (SMA) with itsown purpose. The term of Marketing Accounting (MA) emerges because of the following reasons; the most significant intersection areaamong marketing and accounting is composed <b>of</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>issue</b> and strategic pricing policy, and prices are determined due to the information based on SMA. To summarize, MA can be defined as collection of marketing information, transmitting to allemployees, calculation of sales and distribution costs. Furthermore, information basis is generated by the means as increasing thecustomer benefit, brand generation, increasing and protecting brand value through brand accounting, pricing in terms ofcompetition. Information which is provided by the accounting department is used to support strategic marketing decisionsthrough credible information, particularly planning and controlling operations in future. In this respect, supporting marketinginformation with accounting information is useful to make a right, valid and qualified decision. This is resulted from coordinationand interaction among departments in an organization. General purpose of this study is to provide a basis for the content of Strategic Marketing Accounting (SMA) which can be consideredas a component of marketing and accounting sciences for strategy and to provide a different perspective on the subject, content andapplications of SMA. Specific purpose of this study is to introduce cost information based SMA in order to support strategic marketingdecisions by using information generated by MIS and AIS and through strategic cost management. In this field, there exist many studies on this subject. Ozimec et al. (2010) works on a study on the geographical effect on marketinginformation system and the effective factors on decision making process. Ouksel (1997) performs a significant study emphasizing thataccounting information system has either facilitating or obstructive impact on recognization process of organizations and thisstudy explains that this is possible through information environment, information distribution and information coordination. Choe (1998) performs a study about the impact of generating accounting information system on users and it is tried to assert theexpectation of users from this system during the generation of it. Developing applications and analyses in accounting information systemare asserted in a study performed by Mauldin (1999). Nicolaou (2000) performs a study on perceptibility probability of the efficiency ofaccounting information systems during the coordination and control processes in the organizations and the impact of accountinginformation system on organization decisions is examined. Poston (2000) performs a study in order to emphasize the significance ofaccounting information system on computer based applications and tries to assert the significance of accounting information systemthrough a separate keyboard system. In a study performed by Leonidou (2004), it is asserted that the integration into expandinginformation market is possible through marketing information system and the harmony among marketing departments in this respect isparticularly executed. Rom (2007) performs a study on management accounting and information system integration and a literature surveyis performed about this. Through a selective approach, Vaassen’s (2009) study analyses the effect on the beneficial use ofaccounting information system and accounting data during decision making process. Allak (2010) performs another study regardingon that marketing information system is significant in New Market studies and efficient use of these data is also required in otherdepartments, and in order to provide this the importance of the Internet use is particularly emphasized and the study is performed onSMEs in Jordan. In a study performed by Nowduri (2011), the importance of marketing information process in decision making processof an organization is discussed and its impact on top management’s decisions is analyzed. The things that decision makers andinformation users in organizations utilize in an environment of uncertainities resulted from the inside and outside factors of organizationsare analysed in a study performed by Ashill (1999). Worrell’s study (2011) examines the importance of {{information and}} networktechnologies in accounting information system and asserts the use of information systems in accounting operations. Andrei-Coman(2011) examines the characteristics of accounting information system used in the Romanian Science Academy and its benefits onusers. A study on applications of accounting information system and implementing scientific research methods is performed byGeerts (2011). In a study performed by Baxter (2011), it is aimed to assert the use of accounting information system through thepreviously applied basic methods and to provide usage convenience for relevant users. When the literature is examined, so many publishments are found on marketing information system and accounting informationsystem. However, a study that exerts the interaction among information system and accounting information system in terms of theorganization is not performed. This is a missing point in the literature. Hence, this study contributes to the literature on this dimensionsince it exerts the contributions of coordinated interaction of marketing information system and accounting information system in termsof the organization...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we study}} some {{foundational}} {{issues in the}} theory <b>of</b> asset <b>pricing.</b> We consider a model where any investment opportunity is {{described in terms of}} cash flows. We do not assume that there is a numéraire, the time horizon is not supposed to be finite, the investment opportunities are not specifically related to the buying and selling of securities on a financial market. In this quite general framework, we consider different possible definitions <b>of</b> admissible <b>prices</b> for a contingent flow, mainly related to arbitrage and equilibrium considerations, and for each possible definition, we characterize the set <b>of</b> admissible <b>prices.</b> Since most market imperfections, such as short sale constraints, convex cone constraints, proportional transaction costs, no borrowing or different borrowing and lending rates, etc., can fit in the preceding model for a specific set of investment opportunities, our approach with flows provides a unified framework for the study <b>of</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>issues</b> in market models with frictions (including imperfections on the numéraire).

Though empirical studies generally conclude that the parimutuel betting markets are surprisingly efficient, it is also found that for horses with lowest odds (favorites), market estimates of winning probabilities are smaller than objective winning probabilities; for horses with highest odds (longshot), the opposite is observed. This phenomenon, called the favorite longshot bias, has many explanations such as risk seeking preference, transaction costs, and non-linear transformation of probabilities into decision weights, etc. This paper combines loss aversion with mental accounting, and provides a new explanation for the favorite longshot bias. We show that the bias exists {{in the absence of}} all above mentioned reasons, and the degree of the bias differs {{depending on the type of}} the mental accounting process that bettors apply...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} reasons for brand defection in a business-to-business financial service. Three cross-sectional studies examine customers who ceased using a brand in the previous month. The research shows that about 60 % of brand defection occurs for reasons that brand managers cannot influence, such as business closure or head office decisions. Hence, retention strategies can have a maximum success rate of 40 %. Furthermore, most defection within this 40 % relates to dissatisfaction with fees and charges, or the attractiveness of competitors' offers. These reasons limit what brand managers can do to retain these customers other than just matching competitors' offers. On the other hand, most customers who defect because <b>of</b> <b>price</b> <b>issues</b> or reasons beyond management control still have a positive attitude towards their former brand {{and are likely to}} consider this brand for future purchases. Only 4 % of lapsed customers defect because of service service-related issues. These customers are less positive about their former brand, compared to other lapsed customers. The research provides implications for investments in customer acquisition versus customer retention. ...|$|R

The determinants of the announcement effect are analysed using a two-stage approach controlling for the endogeneity <b>of</b> the <b>price</b> discount. We first estimate the predicted discount and then include it as an independent variable in the announcement effect regression. The discount is positively related to the offer size and negatively related to underwriter quality, supporting underwriter certification models. We also include variables {{that have not been}} tested in any market, such as shareholder concentration which is negatively related to the discount implying that firms with higher shareholder concentration do not offer a significant discount as their shareholders wish to maintain their percentage holding in the firm. Further, the abnormal returns have a negative relationship with the predicted price discount, and a positive relationship with the use of proceeds. Finally, announcements made by resource firms generate larger negative reactions than other issuers. ...|$|R
40|$|Within the {{framework}} of heterogeneous agent models, this paper analyzes the impact factors on the issuance of an insurance-linked security (ILS), and gives an ILS pricing formula and the conditions of existence and stability <b>of</b> the <b>issue</b> <b>price.</b> We consider two cases: fixed supply and flexible supply. We find that, in the fixed volume case, to assure the successful issuance of an ILS, an appropriate volume of the ILS is necessary, and to attract investors, the ILS should pay a positive premium which can help investors to enhance the efficient frontier of their portfolio. In the flexible supply case, we show that the <b>issue</b> <b>price</b> <b>of</b> an ILS is given by the weighted average of different beliefs about the discounted ILS return, and the stability <b>of</b> the <b>issue</b> <b>price</b> depends on the numbers of investors and sponsors and the extrapolation rate to the ILS of investors. In addition, whether an ILS has the hedging ability to sponsors depends on their own understanding about the ILS coupon {{and the relationship between}} the recovery from the ILS and their liability, but how much the risk of sponsors can be hedged relies on the ILS coupon expected by investors...|$|R

40|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 20 th {{century the}} primary {{convertible}} bond market changed from one where purchasers only held long positions in convertible bonds to one dominated by convertible bond arbitrageurs. In this paper we examine how this shift in demand has affected the motivations for firms to issue convertibles, by analyzing whether issuers adapt the design of their offerings to cater to the change in their clientele. We find that the design surprise more than doubles in the arbitrage period, as more issuers structure their offering to be more equity-like. Whereas the design surprise is positively related to underpricing, the sensitivity of the design is half as much in the period dominated by hedge funds {{as it is in the}} prior period. Convertible bond issuers in the hedge fund period can therefore quickly raise money without sacrificing much in terms <b>of</b> <b>pricing</b> <b>of</b> the <b>issue.</b> Our paper contributes to a recent stream of studies on the impact of buy-side characteristics on corporate finance transactions, and extends prior knowledge on the motivations for firms to issue convertible bonds...|$|R
