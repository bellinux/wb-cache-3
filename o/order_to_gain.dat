In <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>gaining</b> additional insights into the use of crisis responses, he pointed out many similar crises should be examined for patterns of strategy use and effect and “a large number of cases could be coded and subjected to loglinear analysis in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> identify patterns.” (Coombs, 2006, p. 191-192) ...|$|R

Even the herbivorous giant panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut. Bears must {{spend much of their}} time feeding in <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>gain</b> enough nutrition from foliage. The panda, in particular, spends 12–15 hours a day feeding.|$|E
