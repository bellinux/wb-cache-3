60|$|We {{can easily}} see how an island fronted only {{on one side}}, or on one side with one end or both ends encircled by barrier-reefs, might after long-continued {{subsidence}} be converted either into a single wall-like reef, or into an atoll with a great straight spur projecting from it, or into two or three atolls tied together by straight reefs--all <b>of</b> <b>which</b> <b>exceptional</b> cases actually occur. As the reef-building corals require food, are preyed upon by other animals, are killed by sediment, cannot adhere to a loose bottom, and may be easily carried down to a depth whence they cannot spring up again, we need feel no surprise at the reefs both of atolls and barriers becoming in parts imperfect. The great barrier of New Caledonia is thus imperfect and broken in many parts; hence, after long subsidence, this great reef would not produce one great atoll 400 miles in length, but a chain or archipelago of atolls, of very nearly the same dimensions {{with those in the}} Maldiva Archipelago. Moreover, in an atoll once breached on opposite sides, from the likelihood of the oceanic and tidal currents passing straight through the breaches, it is extremely improbable that the corals, especially during continued subsidence, would ever be able again to unite the rim; if they did not, as the whole sank downwards, one atoll would be divided into two or more. In the Maldiva Archipelago there are distinct atolls so related to each other in position, and separated by channels either unfathomable or very deep (the channel between Ross and Ari atolls is 150 fathoms, and that between the north and south Nillandoo atolls is 200 fathoms in depth), {{that it is impossible to}} look at a map of them without believing that they were once more intimately related. And in this same archipelago, Mahlos-Mahdoo atoll is divided by a bifurcating channel from 100 to 132 fathoms in depth, in such a manner that it is scarcely possible to say whether it ought strictly to be called three separate atolls, or one great atoll not yet finally divided.|$|E

Two interpretations of the kinship system were used and one was, {{from the standpoint of}} the church, binding. This led to the establishment of certain behaviors and of an activity of identifying and storing of personal and family data.

40|$|Ultra-High Performance Fibre-Reinforced Concrete (UHPFRC) is an {{innovative}} concrete type {{with a high}} compressive strength and a far more durable character compared to conventional concrete. UHPFRC can be applied in structures with aesthetic appearance and high material efficiency. Shell structures are spatially curved surface structures <b>of</b> <b>which</b> the <b>exceptional</b> behaviour {{can be referred to}} as 'form-resistant structures' which resist loads by developing stresses in its own plane. This paper describes the optimization process for the application of prefabricated rib-stiffened UHPFRC-elements. A spherical shell is designed with a span of 150 m and a height of 37. 5 m. The designed prefabricated elements have a weighted mean thickness of 44 mm and a 'thickness over radius'-ratio <b>of</b> 2130, <b>which</b> is about 20 times more slender than an egg shell.

40|$|Three {{patients}} with a spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma are presented, one <b>of</b> <b>which</b> is <b>exceptional</b> because it {{could be attributed to}} thrombolysis with alteplase. The other two were correlated with oral anticoagulant therapy. Our second case suggests that Morbus Kahler may be an underlying pathology in spinal extradural hematoma. In the third patient neither an obvious 'locus minoris resistentiae' nor a pathological coagulation test could be held responsible for the spontaneous bleeding. All three patients underwent laminectomy and evacuation of the hematoma. Although two of our cases are examples of complete recuperation after late operative intervention, early surgery is preferable. Permanent clinical attention together with a low threshold to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) leads to a quicker diagnosis of spinal epidural hematoma. We show that administration of gadolinium may facilitate correct preoperative localization of the hematoma because there may be contrast enhancement of the hematoma. Finally, the postoperative policy concerning thromboembolic prophylaxis is discussed. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Given a {{database}} of records, {{it might be possible}} to identify small subsets <b>of</b> data <b>which</b> distribution is exceptionally different from the distribution in the complete set of data records. Finding such interesting relationships, <b>which</b> we call <b>exceptional</b> relationships, in an automated way would allow discovering unusual or exceptional hidden behaviour. In this paper, we formulate the problem of mining exceptional relationships as a special case of exceptional model mining and propose a grammar-guided genetic programming algorithm (MERG 3 P) that enables the discovery of any exceptional relationships. In particular, MERG 3 P can work directly not only with categorical, but also with numerical data. In the experimental evaluation, we conduct a case study on mining exceptional relations between well-known and widely used quality measures <b>of</b> association rules, <b>which</b> <b>exceptional</b> behaviour would be of interest to pattern mining experts. For this purpose, we constructed a data set comprising a wide range of values for each considered association rule quality measure, such that possible exceptional relations between measures could be discovered. Thus, besides the actual validation of MERG 3 P, we found that the Support and Leverage measures in fact are negatively correlated under certain conditions, while in general experts in the field expect these measures to be positively correlated.

40|$|The {{economic}} {{dynamics of}} a geographical area as an "industrial district" {{or as an}} "innovative milieu" has been analyzed by numerous theories and approaches. Therefore, {{the complexity of the}} phenomenon needs more than one theory or approach to grasp all its aspects. Nevertheless, one needs to identify the core characteristics that provide the economic dynamics of a given territory. For this purpose we will adopt a synthetic analysis method to identify the main characteristics of an industrial cluster, and then elaborate a comprehensive concept that elucidates the whole phenomenon. The theoretical findings will be applied to the case of Sfax -the second biggest city <b>of</b> Tunisia- <b>which</b> presents <b>exceptional</b> economic dynamics. The research focusing on the economic activities of Sfax was led by authors from various disciplines, providing data needed for this paper. ...|$|R

On several occasions — notably in connection with the redemption of the Italian railways and the Paris Exhibition of 1878 — he acted as representative of the government. In 1877 he was given the lucrative appointment of Secretary of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus by Depretis, and in 1886 was made senator.

In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 he was not given a command in the field, but after the opening disasters had shaken the Ollivier ministry he was entrusted by the empress-regent with the portfolio of war, and became president of the council (10 August). He at once, with great success, reorganized the military resources of the nation. He claimed to have raised Marshal MacMahon's force at Châlons to 140,000 men, to have created three new army corps, 33 new regiments and 100,000 gardes mobiles, and to have brought the defences of the capital to a state of efficiency [...] - [...] all this in 24 days.
