5|$|Mars is {{approximately}} half {{the diameter of}} Earth with a surface area <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> than the total area of Earth's dry land. Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust. It can look like butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} of approximately equal amounts of silicate rock and water ice. It is a fully differentiated body with an iron-rich, liquid core, and an internal ocean that may contain more water than all of Earth's oceans combined.

Lighter regions, crosscut by extensive grooves and ridges and <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> ancient, cover the remainder. The cause of the light terrain's disrupted geology is not fully known, but was likely the result of tectonic activity due to tidal heating.|$|E

5|$|A PAT is most {{commonly}} attempted from the two- or three-yard line, {{depending on the}} level of play. If scored by a placekick or dropkick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, and is typically called the extra point. Conversely, a team may elect to run a single play from scrimmage and attempt, once again, to achieve what would normally be considered a touchdown. In such a case, a successful attempt is called the two-point conversion and is worth two points. For the 2015 season, the NFL adopted a rules on PATs that stated during an extra point the placekick must be kicked at the 15-yard line and on extra points if the kick is blocked and the opposing team returns it into the end zone or if during a two-point conversion the ball is fumbled or intercepted and returned to the end zone the opposing team will score two points. No points are awarded on a failed extra point or two-point conversion attempt. In general, the extra point is almost always successful in professional play and is <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> successful at amateur levels, while the two-point conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.|$|E

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} which of several pathological methods of measuring lung cancer volume compared most favourably {{with the gold}} standard. METHODS: Three pathological methods were used on 54 resected lung cancers: (1) measuring the maximum dimension and assuming a spherical shape; (2) measuring three dimensions and assuming an ellipsoidal shape; and (3) deriving the volume from the area of tumour on sequential 1 cm slices using a photocopier and an image analysis system. The gold standard {{was obtained from the}} area of whole mount tumour sections on sequential 0. 1 cm slices of eight cancers. RESULTS: Volumes derived from 1 cm lung slices gave results closest to our gold standard but assuming tumours were ellipsoidal was <b>only</b> a <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> accurate and less time consuming method. Assuming cancers were spherical resulted in gross overestimation of the tumour volumes. CONCLUSIONS: For practical purposes, it is reasonable to measure three dimensions of a lung tumour at sectioning and calculate the volume using the formula for an ellipsoid (V = 4 / 3 pi d. e. f, where d, e and f are the semi-axes) ...|$|R
30|$|It {{is shown}} in Fig.  2 that the lowest value of CV results from counts taken at the {{commuter}} site.

It {{was found that the}} CV value resulting from 48 -h count is the lowest at all the commuter sites. The highest values are observed for recreational sites. Intermediate values of CV result for counts taken at regional commuter and rural long-distance sites. It was also observed that the 12 - and 24 -h counts taken at commuter sites produce CV values, which are <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> higher (<b>less</b> than 1 %) than those for longer duration hours. For recreational sites, this difference could be more than 3 %. The average values of CV for counts taken at commuter sites and regional commuter sites with durations longer than 24 -h do not exceed 5 % and 6.5 %, respectively, during winter months. For this reason, highway agencies might find it acceptable to carry out counts during the winter at commuter and regional commuter roads.|$|R

40|$|We present {{two-dimensional}} inviscid hydrodynamic {{simulations of}} overstable inertial-acoustic oscillation modes (p-modes) in black-hole accretion discs. These global spiral waves {{are trapped in}} the inner-most region of the disc, and are driven overstable by wave absorption at the corotation resonance ($r_c$) when the gradient of the background disc vortensity (vorticity divided by surface density) at $r_c$ is positive and the disc inner boundary is sufficiently reflective. Previous linear calculations {{have shown that the}} growth rates of these modes can be as high as 10 % of the rotation frequency at the disc inner edge. We confirm these linear growth rates and the primary disc oscillation frequencies in our simulations when the mode amplitude undergoes exponential growth. We show that the mode growth saturates when the radial velocity perturbation becomes comparable to the disc sound speed. During the saturation stage, the primary disc oscillation frequency differs <b>only</b> <b>slightly</b> (by <b>less</b> than a few percent) from the linear mode frequency.

The clinical response and left ventricular function were evaluated with treadmill exercise and with radionuclide ventriculography performed while the patient was at rest or exercising supine with a bicycle ergometer. All the treatments significantly prolonged exercise duration (p less than 0. 001) and reduced the number of patients terminating treadmill exercise because of angina (p less than 0. 05).
