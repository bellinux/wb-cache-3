5|$|In 2009, Taylor {{started having}} {{troubles}} {{in his personal}} life again. On November 8, {{he was arrested in}} Miami-Dade County, Florida for leaving the scene of an accident after striking another vehicle with his Cadillac Escalade. He had already committed the same offense in 1996 when he totaled his Lexus in a <b>one-car</b> <b>accident</b> and left the scene, saying he did not think the law required the reporting of a single driver incident. He was released on a $500 bond, and the other driver later sued him, seeking $15,000. He was arrested six months later for having sex with a 16-year-old girl at a Holiday Inn located in Montebello, New York. He was charged with felony third-degree statutory rape, for allegedly engaging in sexual intercourse with someone under 17. He was also charged with third-degree patronization for allegedly paying the underage girl $300 to have sex with him. The girl was represented by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred when Taylor pleaded guilty on March 22, 2011 and was sentenced to six years probation as part of a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to the misdemeanors of sexual misconduct and patronizing a prostitute. He will also have to register as a low-risk level one sex offender. On October 26, 2012, a court rejected the victim's claims that Taylor assaulted her.|$|E
25|$|Tragedy {{struck the}} team just eight {{days after the}} sale, as star forward Dany Heatley crashed his Ferrari in a <b>one-car</b> <b>accident</b> that seriously injured both himself and Thrashers center Dan Snyder. Heatley {{suffered}} a broken jaw and arm, a sprained wrist and a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and medial collateral ligament (MCL); Snyder died five days later due to septic shock from his injuries. The Thrashers dedicated their entire 2003–04 season to Snyder's memory, and Thrashers players wore black patches with Snyder's number, 37, on their jerseys for the season. Heatley's blood alcohol content was below the legal limit, but his combination of speeding (he was driving an estimated 80 miles per hour) and recklessness led to criminal charges, which were later dropped. He eventually received three years' probation and community service.|$|E
25|$|Driving to Champion Stadium for {{the first}} day of {{workouts}} for pitchers and catchers, Braves starter Tommy Hanson was involved in a <b>one-car</b> <b>accident</b> that caused him to bump his head around seven in the morning on February 20, 2012. After arriving at the stadium, Hanson informed the medical staff of the incident, stating that he was feeling abnormal. Seeking medical attention, Hanson was diagnosed with a Grade 1 concussion, providing a delay in his Spring workouts. The Braves medical staff performed several concussion impact tests on Hanson to gauge when a return to normal workouts would be appropriate. Hanson did not expect to miss his first start of the regular season. After a full recovery and ample time for preparation during Spring training, Hanson was assigned as the Opening Day starter, making his first start against the New York Mets on April 5.|$|E

40|$|The man, {{for whom}} Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science in Los Angeles is named, was a {{brilliant}} Black physician, famous for his pioneering work in blood preservation. Born in Washington, D. C. on June 3, 1904, his life ended {{in an auto accident}} just two months before his 46 th birthday. The intervening years were crowded with achievements, learning and sharing his knowledge to benefit mankind. In 1926 he graduated from Amherst College in Massachusetts, where his athletic prowess in track and football earned him the Mossman trophy as the man who contributed most to athletics for four years. Dr. Drew taught biology and served as coach at Morgan State College in Baltimore before entering McGill University School of Medicine. As a medical student, he became an Alpha Omega Alpha Scholar and won the J. Francis Fellowship, based on a competitive examination given annually to the top five students in the graduating class. In 1933, he received his M. D. degree. His first appointment at Howard University was as faculty instructor in pathology from 1935 - 36, and later as an instructor in surgery and an assistant at Freedmen 2 ̆ 7 s Hospital, a federally operated facility associated with Howard. Awarded a two-year Rockefeller Fellowship in surgery in 1938, Dr. Drew began postgraduate work and earned his Doctor of Science in Surgery degree at Columbia University. His doctoral thesis, 2 ̆ 2 Banked Blood: A Study in Blood Preservation 2 ̆ 2 was based on an exhaustive study of blood preservation techniques, which began at McGill University. It was while he was engaged in research at Columbia 2 ̆ 7 s Presbyterian Hospital that his ultimate destiny in serving mankind was shaped. The military emergency of World War II, demanding a vital need for information and procedures to preserve blood, made Dr. Drew the 2 ̆ 2 man of the hour 2 ̆ 2. As the European war scene became more violent, and the need for blood plasma intensified, Dr. Drew was selected to become full-time Medical Director of the Blood for Britain Project. In February 1941, he was appointed Director of the first American Red Cross Blood Bank in charge of blood for use by the U. S. Army and Navy. Dr. Drew resigned his position with the American Red Cross Blood Bank after the War Department sent out a directive stating that blood taken from white donors should not be mixed with that of Black donors. This issue caused widespread controversy. In 1939, Dr. Drew married Lenora Robbins. They had four children: Bebe, Charlene, Rhea, and Charles. In 1944, he received the Spingarn Medal from the NAACP for his work on British and American Projects. Virginia State College conferred upon him an honorary Doctor of Science in 1945, and his alma mater Amherst conferred the same degree in 1947. On April 1, 1950, Dr. Drew was motoring with three colleagues to {{the annual meeting of the}} John A. Andrews Clinical Association in Tuskegee, Alabama, when he was killed in a <b>one-car</b> <b>accident.</b> The automobile struck the soft shoulder of the road and overturned. Dr. Drew, who was severely injured, was rushed to a nearby hospital in Burlington, North Carolina. It was, however, too late to save him. Dr. Charles R. Drew died at 8 a. m. on April 1, 1950. Dr. Charles Drew did not make much money but he was a generous man. Dr. Drew made what he considered his greatest contribution to medicine: teaching and helping to certify hundreds of Black surgeons.
