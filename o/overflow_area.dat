40|$|The Somme River Basin {{is located}} above a chalk aquifer and the {{discharge}} of the somme River is highly influenced by groundwater inflow (90 % of river discharge is baseflow). In 2001, the Somme River Basin suffered from a major flood causing damages estimated to 100 million Euro (Deneux and Martin, 2001). The {{purpose of the present}} research is to evaluate the ability of four hydrologic models to reproduce flood events in the Somme River Basin over an 18 -year period, by comparison with observed river discharge and piezometric head as well as satellite-derived extents of the flooded area. The models used differ in their computation of the surface water budget and in their representation of saturated and unsaturated zones. One model needed structural modification to be able to accurately simulate the riverflows of the Somme river. The models obtained fair to good simulations of the observed piezometric heads, but they all overestimate the piezometric level after flooding, possibly because of a simplistic representation of the deep unsaturated flow. Models differ in their annual partition of the infiltration of water within the root zone (mostly driven by simulated evapotranspiration), but these differences are attenuated by water transfers within the saturated and unsaturated zone. As a consequence, the inter-model dispersion of the computed annual baseflow is reduced. The aquifer <b>overflow</b> <b>areas</b> simulated during flooding compare well with local data and satellite images. The models showed that this overflow occurs almost every year in the same areas (in the floodplain), and that the flooding of 2001 was characterized by an increase in the quantity of the overflow and not much by a spreading of the <b>overflow</b> <b>areas.</b> Inconsistencies between river discharge and piezometric levels suggest that further investigation are needed to estimate the relative influence of unsaturated and saturated zones on the hydrodynamics of the Somme River Basin...|$|R

50|$|The {{quotient}} filter is {{a compact}} hash table. Cleary defines a compact hash table {{as one in}} which the table entries contain only a portion of the key plus some additional meta-data bits. These bits are used to deal with the case when distinct keys happen to hash to the same table entry. By way of contrast, other types of hash tables that deal with such collisions by linking to <b>overflow</b> <b>areas</b> are not compact because the overhead due to linkage can exceed the storage used to store the key. In a quotient filter a hash function generates a p-bit fingerprint. The r least significant bits is called the remainder while the q = p - r most significant bits is called the quotient, hence the name quotienting (coined by Knuth.)The hash table has 2q slots.|$|R
50|$|Psilocybe ovoideocystidiata {{is mainly}} {{native to the}} eastern United States, in a range that {{stretches}} from Kentucky to Rhode Island, but has been found {{as far south as}} Georgia. It is common in the Ohio river valley, here it is often found in the woody debris of <b>overflow</b> <b>areas,</b> along rivers and streams. More generally, it is often found in man-made mulch and wood chips. More recently, it has turned up in the western United States, in the Pacific States from Western Washington to Southern California, though it is still a relatively uncommon species in this region. It has also been reported from Europe, specifically in Switzerland and southern Germany. Seasonality varies a great deal depending on what region they are found in, but in the northeastern US, are most common from April to mid June but they occasionally fruit as late as November.|$|R
50|$|The grey grasswren {{occupies}} a restrictive area of arid inland floodplains of central Australia. Sightings have {{occurred at the}} Bulloo Overflow in the New South Wales/Queensland border area, lower Cooper Creek, along the Kallakoopah anabranch of the Diamantina River and the <b>overflow</b> <b>areas</b> of lakes Machattie, Koolivoo and Mipea on Eyre Creek in South Australia.These birds frequent mainly floodplains of the above systems which contain areas dominated by lignum (Muehlenbeckia florulenta) and cane grass (Eragrostis australasia) on major drainage lines between resident sand dunes. In some swampy areas, a dense understory of spike-rush (Eleocharis plana), channel millet (Echinochloa turnerana), and sedges (Cyperus species) are present. The grey grasswren has also been known to occupy open vegetative areas well beyond the lignum swamps which are less subject to inundation during flood events. It appears that in drought years the grey grasswren occupies tall dense lignum as a refuse while in normal years it prefers other habitats. Hardy (2002) recorded significantly more captures in declared drought years than in normal years.|$|R

40|$|Mosquito {{control in}} Poland is still {{dominated}} {{by the use of}} chemicals. Although it has been 13 years since the flood of the century, only in few cities and towns (Wroclaw, Gorzow Wielkopolski and Torun) various methods of mosquito control such as mapping of larvae development and setting time limits for the imagines occur-rence were developed. The problem of mosquito control is not only limited to adult insects, it is also much more a complex issue due to the use of insecticides in the environment that we would rather like to keep unchanged, with a diversity of co-existing species of plants and animals. In addition to eradication of larvae and adult insects, we should also: carry out actions modifying environment so that it becomes less friendly to mosquitoes (e. g. drying wet mead-ows as a result of land reclamation), protect places where people reside - with the use of insecticide lamps and spatial repellents, as well as catchers for aggressive female mosquitoes. Increasing the share of environmental management methods and public education on preventing to form and eliminating existing places of mosquito larvae development in urban green <b>areas</b> (parks, river <b>overflow</b> <b>areas</b> and drainage ditches) are still an undervalued element of integrated mosquito control in Poland...|$|R

50|$|Due to {{the very}} high {{groundwater}} fluctuations and {{despite the lack of}} space, a sealed ground water lake with a high water table was built. The lakes water-impermeable layers (tertiary) are sealed around and create a dense run off trough. To avoid groundwater damming, three basic water transfers (culverts) were built allow water to transfer from south to north, and in addition to the run off area, the groundwater is pumped out of the ground in the other surrounding areas and flows into the lake. Through an <b>overflow</b> <b>area</b> at the western end of the lake, the access water is purified in the infiltration basin and fed into the ground water. Through the exchange of water, a consistent water quality can be ensured.|$|E

40|$|As on-chip {{networks}} become {{prevalent in}} multiprocessor systemson-a-chip and multi-core processors, {{they will be}} an integral part of the design flow of such systems. With power increasingly the primary constraint in chips, the tool chain in systems design, from simulation infrastructures to compilers and synthesis frameworks, needs to take network power into account, motivating the need for early-stage communication power analysis. While there has been substantial research in network performance analysis that enabled critical insights into network design, no power analysis frameworks for networks exist. In this paper, we propose such a framework that takes as input message flows, and derives a power profile of the network fabric, capturing both the spatial variance across the network fabric as well as the temporal variance across application execution time. Our analysis is based on link utilization as the unit of abstraction for network power, with contention among message flows modeled through propagation of <b>overflow</b> <b>areas</b> in link utilization functions. When validated against Orion, a cycle-accurate network power simulator, we show that relative trends in network power are well-preserved. We then demonstrate potential uses of our analysis framework through three case studies, from speedup of multiprocessor and network simulations, to facilitating power-aware communication synthesis and compiler code placement...|$|R
40|$|Based on data {{obtained}} from field investigations, this paper aims to analyze {{the influence of the}} river overflow on the desert riparian vegetation and discuss the function of the river overflow on the vegetation restoration at the lower Tarim River. The results show that (1) there are only 17 species, 13 genera and 9 families in the study <b>areas</b> before river <b>overflow,</b> while there are 34 species, 26 genera and 12 families after the overflowing in which 18 species emerged newly; (2) judging by the biodiversity indices, the species diversity and species richness in the river <b>overflowed</b> <b>area</b> increase more significantly than those in the un-overflow area; (3) judging by the importance of different species after years of river overflowing, the annual herbs germinate quickly at first, while the perennial herbs with deep roots or root clones become dominant in the plant community; (4) after several times of river overflowing, some arbors and shrubs such as Populus euphratica and Tamarix ramosissima germinate easily and can dominate gradually in the plant community. The results indicate that the river overflowing restores the severely degraded ecosystem in the lower Tarim River and the function is connected with restoration of eco-hydrological processes in the study areas. The results suggest that experimental overflowing has initiated a process of restoring ecosystem function within the riparian forest. © Springer-Verlag 2008. (22 refs. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{author has}} {{identified}} the following significant results. Northward flowing rivers of Alaska inundate extensive areas of sea ice during spring breakup. This {{process has been}} studied under the ERTS- 1 program. Drainage of large volumes of fresh water through the ice at holes and cracks (strudel) causes scour depressions, over 4 m deep, and up to 20 m across in the sea floor below. Strudel scours occur within 30 km of river mouths, generally in areas where ERTS- 1 imagery shows less potential for drifting ice to scour the bottom than elsewhere. The shapes and distribution patterns of strudel scours correspond with those of strudel seen in the ice canopy. Densities of scours are highest in the inner areas of overlfow. But strudel scours also occur outside of <b>overflow</b> <b>areas</b> mapped during the last several years. These must be very old. One strudel scour investigated by diving {{is surrounded by a}} rim, has vertical walls exposing a tundra horizon, and terminates at a gravel layer 4 m below the lagoon floor. Another terminates at a semi-consolidated layer of silty clay. The gravel and silty clay are pre-Holocene deposits. Mixing of Holocene marine with older sediments by vertical strudel flow causes great variability in sediment types over small areas. These observations complicate interpretation of shallow water deposits of cold climates...|$|R
