5000|$|Despite the {{pressures}} of a long-term suit, the company developed the first drum pump for transferring lubricants from the original refinery containers. Lincoln developed the first portable <b>oil</b> <b>drain</b> and a quick detachable air coupler. These innovations led to complete lubrication pumps and swivel assemblies that dispensed lubricant directly from the original refinery container to an automobile on an overhead lift. Service stations, car dealers and mechanics began to heavily promote their lubrication services and Lincoln developed white drum sleeves to cover the refinery containers. (Fox) ...|$|E
50|$|The SRT-4 {{used the}} same basic engine block as the {{naturally}} aspirated 2003+ 2.4L, and {{was different from the}} years previous used in the naturally aspirated Chrysler 2.4L mid-size cars such as the PT Cruiser and four-door Stratus. The SRT4 engine had many improvements, including: stronger crank case webbing, a thicker deck with 11 mm head bolts (vs 10 mm), an <b>oil</b> <b>drain</b> back for the turbo, a cast aluminum structural oil pan, a higher capacity oil pump, a crankshaft of higher hardness steel, improved machining of bearing journals, oil squirters (to cool underside of pistons), eutectic aluminum alloy pistons made specially by Mahle, and forged connecting rods with cracked caps and 9 mm bolts. The cylinder head was also different for turbo engines, from naturally aspirated. The turbo version (PT Cruiser GT Turbo and SRT-4) included: larger diameter valves and seats, exhaust valves made of Inconel, improved cooling and larger <b>oil</b> <b>drain</b> back passages, different camshafts. The PT Cruiser Turbo engine package differs from the SRT-4 because the intake manifold, turbocharger plumbing and intercooler are different. The SRT-4 intercooler was a front-mounted cast aluminum 8-row unit produced by Valeo, unique in its efficiency and computer designed end tanks for air flow.|$|E
50|$|Another {{common problem}} with the 2001-2006 5.3L engines was {{cracking}} cylinder heads. This is commonly called the 'Castech Head' failure on the internet. GM issued a TSB on this failure to help service techs identify the problem. The head casting (which can be viewed from the passenger side of the vehicle {{just in front of}} the valve cover) was 706. Some heads with this casting number would fail (but not all of them) as GM had different suppliers for the same head. The failure was due to undetected porosity around the <b>oil</b> <b>drains</b> in the head.|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{potential}} problems with hydraulic lifters. Frequently, the valvetrain will rattle loudly on startup due to <b>oil</b> <b>draining</b> from the lifters when the vehicle is parked. This is not considered significant provided the noise disappears within a couple of minutes; typically it usually lasts only a second or two. A rattle that does not go away can indicate a blocked oil feed, or that {{one or more of the}} lifters has collapsed due to wear and is no longer opening its valve fully. The affected lifter should be replaced in the latter situation.|$|R
50|$|Mid -1939 saw a {{complete}} revamp of Bedfords; {{with only the}} HC van continuing in production. The new range consisted of the K (30-40 cwt), MS and ML (2-3 ton), OS and OL (3-4 ton), OS/40 and OL/40 (5 ton) series, and the OB bus. Also on offer was a new 10-12 cwt van, the JC, derived from the new J Model Vauxhall car. Many of the trucks sold by Bedford between June and September 1939 were requisitioned for military use on {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War; many were abandoned after the retreat from Dunkirk, rendered useless to the enemy by removing the engine <b>oil</b> <b>drain</b> plug and running the engine. Because the German armed forces in 1940 were, contrary to their popular image, desperately short of motor transport, many of these captured Bedfords were repaired and pressed into service alongside Opel Blitz (also part of GM) trucks by the German armed forces - although the Bedfords mainly filled second-line roles, including civil defence.|$|E
5000|$|In larger steam {{turbines}} an oil operated servo mechanism {{is used in}} order to enhance the lever sensitivity. The use of a relay system magnifies the small deflections of the lever connected to the governor sleeve. The differential lever is connected at both the ends to the governor sleeve and the throttle valve spindle respectively. The pilot valves spindle is also connected to the same lever at some intermediate position. Both the pilot valves cover one port each in the oil chamber. The outlets of the oil chamber are connected to an <b>oil</b> <b>drain</b> tank through pipes.The decrease in load during operation of the turbine will bring about increase in the shaft speed thereby lifting the governor sleeve. Deflection occurs in the lever and due to this the pilot valve spindle raises up opening the upper port for oil entry and lower port for oil exit. Pressurized oil from the oil tank enters the cylinder and pushes the relay piston downwards. As the relay piston moves the throttle valve spindle attached to it also descends and partially closes the valve. Thus the steam flow rates can be controlled. When the load on the turbine increases the deflections in the lever are such that the lower port is opened for oil entry and upper port for oil exit. The relay piston moves upwards and the throttle valve spindle ascend upwards opening the valve.The variation of the steam consumption rate ṁ (kg/h) with the turbine load during throttle governing is linear and is given by the “willan’s line”. The equation for the willan’s line is given by: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{decision}} was made by Pond to attend Reno with the same engines used for flight testing. In fact, a vibrator was still attached to the left vertical stabilizer to initiate flutter {{as part of the}} planned flight test program. There was no expectation of victory the first year. It was viewed as a [...] "dress rehearsal" [...] more than anything else. After takeoff for the final event on Sunday, the left engine threw a rod out the side of the block and created a tunnel of fire 4 ft in diameter and about 15 ft long. An onboard halon extinguishing system put the oil fire out and an uneventful single-engine landing was made. The engine installations were very compact and [...] "close cowled", meaning the bodywork covering the engines had little clearance. The carbon fiber engine cowling was a structural component of the aircraft and as such had to be protected from heat-soak after shutdown. This was accomplished via two 2-stroke weed blowers immediately after the blades stopped turning, quickly followed by two air conditioner blowers attached to the air inlet [...] "scuppers". The engine cowlings were lined with corrugated inconel of [...]007 thickness. Airflow was vital to structural integrity. Conversely, the powerplant units had to be preheated to nearly operating temperature before fireup. This was due to the tight tolerances of the engine main bearings. Because methanol burns much cooler than gasoline, cooling was never an issue. Actually the cold nature of the methanol gave the team a problem with oil viscosity. The thick, graphite laden oil would [...] "puke" [...] overboard {{for the majority of the}} time while airborne. Eventually it was determined that the <b>oil</b> <b>drain</b> holes were undersized in the rocker area of the heads as they were not intended to run at a constant high RPM in an automobile application. Fully half of the radiator inlet ducting was blocked off after the first test flight on March 22, 1991. Dick Rutan was the initial test pilot. Mike Melvill also flew the plane as did Steve Hinton as part of the test program.|$|E
40|$|A failed {{pitch change rod}} of a {{helicopter}} was forwarded to the laboratory for analyzing the cause of failure. Investigation showed that the failure occurred due to pitting corrosion on the internal surface of the rod. Chlorine {{was found to be}} responsible for promoting pitting corrosion. Evidences suggest that the corrodants were carried through the lubricant. Hence contamination of the lubricant with chlorine ion appears to be the most probable reason for the failure. In view of this, it is recommended that the <b>oil</b> <b>drained</b> out from the TGB be chemically analyzed to look for chlorine and water, present, if any. No material abnormalities were found responsible for the failure...|$|R
30|$|The SAGD process {{involves}} {{two parallel}} long horizontal wells with one being {{located at the}} bottom as the producer and the other located at the top to inject steam continuously.

30|$|Before {{study of}} process performance, heating and oil {{recovery}} of all processes are discussed to some extent. The following mechanisms mentioned {{here is the}} result of study presented in a previous author’s paper (Fattahi et al. 2012) which is thoroughly discussed in that paper. In oil-wet FR, steam enters fractures and then heats the matrix block, however, oil cannot move out from matrix until fractures are filled with steam, therefore <b>oil</b> <b>drains</b> from the matrix to fracture due to density difference between oil in matrix and steam in the fracture. The extracted oil from matrix to fracture is drained to producer via fracture by gravity. However, at the bottom part of steam chamber, fracture oil saturation is high, and consequently it prevents expulsion of oil from matrix, although it is inside the steam chamber. Gas/oil capillary pressure prevents oil extraction from matrix before the oil saturation reaches its residual amount.|$|R
30|$|Heat loss {{increases}} the energy {{requirements of a}} thermal recovery method {{in the context of}} increased need to heat carrying agent. Ignoring the heat losses occurred during the SAGD experiments adversely affects the quantitative and qualitative results acquired due to the excessive steam condensation. During drainage of the mobile oil from an experimental model in the SAGD process, the overall heat loss increases with time (i.e. the more <b>oil</b> <b>drains</b> out of the model, the more depleted area is available for the heat loss). Use of an effective vacuum environment can significantly limit different heat transfer mechanisms. For instance, a vacuum pressure of 0.01  torr or less is required for significant reduction of the heat loss through conduction mechanism (Roth 1990). Moreover, to establish an insulating vacuum jacket for minimizing convective element of the heat transfer, it is required to achieve an extremely low vacuum pressure of about 1  ×  10 − 6  torr (Guyer 1999).|$|R
