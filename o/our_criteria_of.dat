This interprets each poetic work {{within the context of}} the historical period from which it emerged.

Brooks vehemently rejected this historical relativism, believing it amounts to [...] "giving up <b>our</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> good and bad" [...] and thus repudiating [...] "our concept of poetry itself".

30|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} prediction filter order in simulations, we mainly relied on our knowledge of input process order, and started with this order. Since <b>our</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> optimization is the minimization of forward prediction error, we increased the order of prediction filter, and monitored output forward prediction error. If the decrease in output prediction error was negligible {{with the increase of}} filter order, we stopped increasing the filter order. Since we would not have a priori knowledge of process order in a practical situation, a model estimator such as ARMAsel[54] can be used for this purpose. As ARMAsel itself functions based on prediction error evaluations, we might not even need further prediction error evaluations. In addition to these considerations, we kept the total complexity the same in all configurations in order to provide a fair comparison of performance such that the order of fullband predictor filter was 48 while the order of predictor filters in two and four-subband implementations were 24 and 12, respectively, in all simulations.|$|E

To evaluate the benefits of Astragalus-containing Chinese herbal prescriptions combined with radiotherapy for NSCLC. Methods. The randomized controlled trials involving NSCLC treatment with Astragalus-containing Chinese herbal prescriptions combined with radiotherapy were searched. The Review Manager 5. 1 software was employed for data analysis. Funnel plot and Egger’s test were applied to evaluate publication bias.

Existing known binary GCPs only have even-lengths {{in the form of}} 21026 (where;; are non-negative integers). To fill the gap left by the odd-lengths, we investigate the optimal odd-length binary pairs which display the closest correlation property to that of GCPs. <b>Our</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> “closeness ” is that each pair has the maximum possible zero-correlation zone (ZCZ) width and minimum possible out-of-zone aperiodic auto-correlation sums.

We show that each optimal OB-ZCP has maximum ZCZ width of (N+ 1) = 2, and minimum out-of-zone aperiodic sum magnitude of 2, where N denotes the sequence length (odd). Systematic constructions of such optimal OP-ZCPs are proposed by insertion and deletion of certain binary GCPs, which settle the 2011 Li-Fan-Tang-Tu open problem positively. The proposed optimal OB-ZCPs may serve as a replacement for GCPs in many engineering applications where odd sequence lengths are preferred.

In a distributed environment, the best match is sought between a computing job to be run and a computer to run the job (global scheduling), which is a function that has not been required by conventional systems. Viewing the computers as 'suppliers' and the users as 'consumers' of computing services, markets for computing services/resources have been examined {{as one of the most}} promising mechanisms for global scheduling. We first establish why economics can contribute to scheduling. We further define the criterion for a scheme to qualify as an application of economics. Many studies to date have claimed to have applied economics to scheduling.

Random sampling density of pollen data averages one observation every ~ 260 years since pine forest development (Figure 1). The temporal difference in the charcoal and pollen record is, however, negated by our use of these data as ecological observations of post-fire or non-fire vegetation composition (i.e., having no significant or insignificant peak associated in the same or preceding sample). The forest is dominated by pine pollen, most of which is likely derived from lodgepole pine (Pinus subgenus Pinus), though traces of Pinus subgenus Strobus suggest the presence of limber pine (Pinus flexilis James). Spruce (Picea A. Dietr.) and fir (Abies Mill.) are also abundant over the last 8 ka. Understory constituents are dominated by sagebrush, which grows locally in openings and forest margins and from surrounding timber-line and lower sagebrush steppe populations. Equally important to the understory are forbs and grasses, dominated by Asteraceae, Amaranthaceae, and Poaceae. Comparison of the ratio between the canopy and the understory was used as a metric of the ecological response of the forest to fires (Figure 2).

Large-scale clinical trials with thousands of participants are particularly important for this purpose in cardiovascular diseases. Conducting large-scale clinical trials entails high research costs.

Findings We searched for trials using clinicaltrials. gov (URL: [URL]) using the key words 'cardio' and 'event' in all fields on 10 April, 2010. We then selected trials with 300 or more participants examining cardiovascular diseases. The search revealed 344 trials that met <b>our</b> <b>criteria.</b> <b>Of</b> 344 trials, 71 % were randomized controlled trials, 15 % involved more than 10, 000 participants, and 59 % were funded by industry.

Materials and Methods: Between July 2005 and July 2008, 406 patients underwent radical prostatectomy for clinical lo-calized prostate cancer in our hospital. Based on preoperative data, 93 of these patients fulfilled <b>our</b> <b>criteria</b> <b>of</b> non-signifi-cance: Gleason score < 7, stage T 1 c, PSA < 10 ng/mL and percentage of affected fragments less than 25 %.

The biochemical recurrence free survival of these operated insignificant cancers were also evaluated. Results: On surgical specimen analysis 74. 7 % of patients had Gleason score of 6 or less and 25. 3 % had Gleason 7 or greater. Furthermore 8. 3 % of cases showed extracapsular extension. After 36 months of follow-up 3. 4 % had biochemical recurrence, defined by a PSA above 0. 4 ng/mL. Conclusions: Despite {{the limited number of}} cases, we have found considerable rates of undergrading and understaging in patients with prostate cancer whose current definitions classified them as candidates for active surveillance.
