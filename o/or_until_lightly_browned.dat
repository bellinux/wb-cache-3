50|$|There {{are several}} methods of cooking a country ham {{including}} slicing and pan-frying, baking whole, and simmering {{for several hours}} (in several changes of water). Whole hams {{may need to be}} scrubbed and soaked for several hours before eating to remove the salt cure and mold. Even when soaked, they are still quite salty. For traditionalists, part of the appeal of country ham is this highly salty taste. Some eaters of country ham scrub, scrape, or pare off the outer crust of curatives, slice it, pan fry it, and eat it as is. Or they may fry the ham with the crust on. Some discard the crust; others consume it along with the meat. Traditionalists, when frying the ham, will typically only place it in a pan long enough to <b>lightly</b> <b>brown</b> it on both sides and to warm the meat. Frying times as short as thirty seconds per side are not uncommon.|$|R
50|$|When making buko pie {{a double}} baking method is followed. The pie crust and the pie filling {{need to be}} {{prepared}} separately before combining the two together. First the pie crust is made by mixing flour, salt and sugar in a bowl. Afterwards, the mixture is made into dough by adding and mixing in ice water and egg yolks. The dough mixture is then refrigerated and thinly rolled out by using a rolling pin. To finish the crust component of the buko pie, the dough is baked and set aside to cool. Next, the pie filling is prepared. The pie filling ingredients listed above are mixed and cooked on low heat. Once the pie crust and the pie filling are finished, they are combined together by pouring the filling into the pie crust. A second crust is used to cover the filling and seal the pie from all sides. It is then baked a second time until the crust is <b>lightly</b> <b>browned.</b>|$|R
