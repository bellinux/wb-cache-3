5|$|Each {{episode of}} Degrassi is written {{following}} the same formula {{with two or three}} storylines (Plot A, Plot B and Plot C). The main storyline, A, opens and closes the episode and is usually driven by a single character. Plot B is usually more comedic in tone and sometimes slightly intertwined with the other stories, often moving story arcs forward. Plot C was usually used sporadically in a season-long arc, but is now used in every episode as comedic relief. The problems and issues presented in the episode are not always resolved {{by the end of the}} episode, and are carried over to the next, <b>or</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> mini-arc over several episodes. The majority of episodes are named after songs from the 1980s, and since the tenth season, episodes are named after songs from the 1990s to the present, representing the entering of a new decade and a completely different cast from the earlier seasons. For the first nine seasons, Degrassi: The Next Generation had been produced as a weekly half-hour teen comedy-drama series, with each season consisting of between fifteen and twenty-four episodes.|$|E
5|$|In the Adventure Mode, the {{characters}} {{compete in a}} race for the Super Big Power Crystal. This race {{is made up of}} six stages, each containing smaller sub-maps. The host of the race, the Viscount, sets a task for each stage. This task must be completed before the player can continue to another map. The player with the most points is the winner of the stage. The overall winner of all the stages is the winner of the Viscount's race. In the Festival Mode, the gameplay is fundamentally the same as in the Adventure Mode, {{with the exception of the}} ability to select stages to play freely. In the My Room mode, the player's character has his or her own private room in which he or she can either play minigames that have been collected in Adventure Mode, view a collection of items obtained in Adventure Mode, <b>or</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> Motion Panel, a unique in-game communication tool can allow customized messages to be sent mid-game to help friends or distract other players' gameplay. The decorations in My Room is different for each character.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 4S {{can play}} music, movies, {{television}} shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes. The iPhone 4S uses a large font that allows users {{plenty of room}} to touch their selection. Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the 4S, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, <b>or</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> Genius playlist.|$|E

25|$|Several months later, Montgomery County Democratic Party leader Col. E. Brooke Lee said {{he would}} support Montgomery County home rule by way of an act of the Maryland state legislature. Lee {{proposed}} a bill to create a position of county supervisor, who would {{be in charge of}} routine county business, would appoint county employees subject to civil service rules and regulations, would supervise expenditures, and would prepare the operating and capital budgets. The bill did not disband the county commissioners <b>or</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> county council. The bill passed the state legislature and was signed by Governor Herbert R. O'Conor in 1945. The county commissioners appointed Willard F. Day to the position.|$|E
25|$|Experiences {{during the}} early part of the Second World War had {{demonstrated}} to the British that the Royal Navy needed access to defensive air cover for Allied fleets and convoys, which could only be provided by more aircraft carriers. In mid-1941, the Director of Naval Construction was instructed to investigate how best to achieve this without the lengthy construction times normally associated with carriers. The options were to refit the surviving Hawkins-class cruisers with flight decks and aviation facilities, convert additional merchant vessels and passenger liners into vessels similar to but more capable than previous merchant aircraft carriers, <b>or</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> new design for a cheap, lightly armed, and unarmoured ship similar to the Woolworth carriers. In December 1941, it was decided that a new design was the best option.|$|E
25|$|The game lets players control two characters: twins Jacob and Evie Frye. Jacob is a hot-headed brawler, {{specializing in}} close-ranged combat, while Evie is strong in stealth and relies on her {{intelligence}} and wit. Additionally, Evie {{is the first}} playable female protagonist of the main series. The main weapons of Syndicate include brass knuckles, a compact revolver, a cane-sword, and the traditional Nepalese curved kukri knife. The game also introduces new systems to navigate the world: a rope launcher, which allows players to rappel up structures, <b>or</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> zip-line between buildings; carriages, which can be piloted or simply occupied by players, and can be the setting of fights and parkour chases; and a train, which serves as the main base for players throughout the game. Unlike its predecessor, the game has no multiplayer mode, and does not feature a companion app, which was introduced in Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the MyTeam team customization, players may create their own brand new team from scratch and play 5-on-5 games against other players and their teams online, in the 2K Pro-Am game mode. Similar to previous games' Crew mode, players customize team logos, colour schemes, court designs, jersey styles, and certain other basketball related aspects. Players can create a variety of designs and themes; for example, the player {{has the ability to}} create the logos of past NBA teams, such as the Seattle SuperSonics, <b>or</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> team which features logos that consists of individual players. Unlike other game modes, Pro-Am teams consists exclusively of MyPlayers. Players may also play 5-on-5 games against other players using regular teams. Regular online games are played in a mode called Play Now. In Play Now, the player essentially levels up as they win games and move through the online ranks.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} earlier, cores {{are usually}} supported by two core prints in the mold. However, there are situations where a core only uses one core print so other means {{are required to}} support the cantilevered end. These are usually supplied {{in the form of}} chaplets. These are small metal supports that bridge the gap between the mold surface and the core. Since the chaplets become part of the casting, the chaplets must be of the same or similar material as the metal being cast. Moreover, their design must be optimized because if they are too small they will completely melt and allow the core to move, but if they are too big then their whole surface cannot melt and fuse with the poured metal. Their use should also be minimized because they can cause casting defects <b>or</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> weak spot in the casting. It is usually more critical to ensure the upper chaplets are stronger than the lower ones because the core will want to float up in the molten metal.|$|E
25|$|At this stage, {{the story}} splits off in {{numerous}} possibilities, {{based on the}} player's choices. The narrator continues the story, but when the player comes to an area where a choice is possible, the narrator will suggest which route Stanley will take. The player can opt to go against the narrator and perform the other action, forcing the narration to account for this new direction which may return the player back to the target path <b>or</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> new narration. For example, the first choice the player makes in the game is at a set of two open doors, with the narrator stating that Stanley chose the left door; the player can choose to follow this narration, which keeps the narrator's story on track, or may choose the right door, which makes the narrator annoyed and causes him to pressure the player {{to return to the}} 'proper' path. Because of this, much of the story is considered thought-provoking about the nature of choice and decisions. The narration also breaks the fourth wall on several occasions in handling the player's decisions.|$|E

25|$|The {{second major}} {{parameter}} {{to be considered}} is the output frequency of the power source. As the heat is predominantly generated in {{the surface of the}} component it is important to select a frequency which offers the deepest practical penetration depth into the material without running the risk of current cancellation. It will be appreciated that as only the skin is being heated time will be required for the heat to penetrate to the centre of the component and that if too much power is applied too quickly it is possible to melt the surface of the component whilst leaving the core cool. Utilising thermal conductivity data for the material and the customers specified homogeneity (physics) requirements regarding the cross sectional ∆T it is possible to calculate <b>or</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> model to establish the heat time required. In many cases the time to achieve an acceptable ∆T will exceed what can be achieved by heating the components one at a time. A range of handling solutions including conveyors, in line feeders, pusher systems and walking beam feeders are utilised to facilitate the heating of multiple components whilst delivering single components to the operator at the required time cycle.|$|E
25|$|Experts have {{tremendous}} experience through practice and {{education in a}} particular field. Musical experts {{use some of the}} same strategies as do many experts in fields that require large amounts of memorization: chunking, organization and practice. For example, musical experts may organize notes into scales <b>or</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> hierarchical retrieval scheme to facilitate retrieval from long term memory. In a case study on an expert pianist, researchers Chaffin & Imreh (2002) found that a retrieval scheme was developed to guarantee that the music was recalled with ease. This expert used auditory and motor memory along with conceptual memory. Together the auditory and motor representations allow for automaticity during performance, whereas the conceptual memory is mainly used to mediate when the piece is getting off track. When studying concert soloists, Chaffin and Logan (2006) reiterate that a hierarchical organization exists in memory, but also take this a step further suggesting that they actually use a mental map of the piece allowing them {{to keep track of the}} progression of the piece. Chaffin and Logan (2006) also demonstrate that there are performance cues that monitor the automatic aspects of performance and adjust them accordingly. They distinguish between basic performance cues, interpretive performance cues, and expressive performance cues. Basic cues monitor technical features, interpretive cues monitor changes made in different aspects of the piece, and expressive cues monitor the feelings of the music. These cues are developed when experts pay attention to a particular aspect during practice.|$|E
25|$|The centennial of Canadian Confederation in 1967 {{provided}} the right opportunity and {{circumstances in which}} to establish Canada's first order: the Order of Canada. The system was officially established in 1972 and has since expanded, mostly through the 1990s, and generally attracted little criticism; indeed, the orders, decorations, and medals of Canada inspired other Commonwealth realms, such as Australia and New Zealand, to adopt similar approaches in their respective jurisdictions, as did each of Canada's provinces. However, some experts in the field, such as Christopher McCreery, have pointed out {{what they see as}} deficiencies in the construct: At the 2006 conference on Commonwealth Honours, the concern was raised that Canada does not have a way to recognize the nation's very best; the three grades of the Order of Canada being insufficient to do so. It was suggested that either two more levels be added to the Order of Canada, equivalent to knighthoods in Australian and British orders, <b>or</b> <b>create</b> <b>a</b> new single class but limited-membership order, similar to the Order of New Zealand. The order of precedence also came under scrutiny, particularly the anomaly that all three grades of the Order of Canada supersede the top levels of each of the other orders, contrary to international practice. McCreery echoed these comments in 2010 and added that the Canadian honours system was lacking a polar medal, such as those issued in other northern nations, as well as a public service order, akin to the Imperial Service Order, and honours to specifically recognise protective services other than the police forces.|$|E
