5|$|In 1994, tomato systemin {{was found}} to bind to a 50KDa protein in the cell {{membrane}} <b>of</b> <b>tomato.</b> The protein has a structure similar to proteases of the Kex2p-like prohormone convertases. This led Schaller and Ryan {{to suggest that it}} is not a receptor, but instead is involved in the processing of ProSys into the active form, or the degradation of Sys. Synthetic forms <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> systemin, with substituted amino acids at the predicted dibasic cleavage site, remained stable in cell cultures for longer than the native form. Later studies have noted that the enzymes responsible for processing ProSys remain unidentified. No further research has been reported on the 50KDa protein to date, and the gene has not been identified.|$|E
5|$|Ailanthus {{has been}} used to re-vegetate areas where acid mine {{drainage}} has occurred and it has been shown to tolerate pH levels as low as 4.1 (approximately that <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> juice). It can withstand very low phosphorus levels and high salinity levels. The drought-tolerance of the tree is strong due to its ability to effectively store water in its root system. It is frequently found in areas where few trees can survive. The roots are also aggressive enough to cause damage to subterranean sewers and pipes. Along highways it often forms dense thickets in which few other tree species are present, largely due to the toxins it produces to prevent competition.|$|E

5|$|Dietary nickel {{may affect}} human health through infections by nickel-dependent bacteria, {{but it is}} also {{possible}} that nickel is an essential nutrient for bacteria residing in the large intestine, in effect functioning as a prebiotic. The U.S. Institute of Medicine has not confirmed that nickel is an essential nutrient for humans, so neither a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) nor an Adequate Intake have been established. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level of dietary nickel is 1000µg/day as soluble nickel salts. Dietary intake is estimated at 70 to 100 µg/day, with less than 10% absorbed. What is absorbed is excreted in urine. Relatively large amounts of nickel – comparable to the estimated average ingestion above – leach into food cooked in stainless steel. For example, the amount of nickel leached after 10 cooking cycles into one serving <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> sauce averages 88µg.|$|E
5|$|In 1991 a {{research}} {{group led by}} Clarence A. Ryan, isolated an 18 amino acid polypeptide from tomato leaves that induced the production of protease inhibitor proteins (PIs) in response to wounding. Experiments using synthetic radio-labelled forms of the polypeptide demonstrated that {{it was able to}} travel systemically through the plant and induce PI production in unwounded leaves. Because of the systemic nature of the wounding signal, it was named systemin, it was the first polypeptide found to function as a hormone in plants. mRNA encoding for systemin is found in all tissues of the plant except the roots. Later studies identified homologs <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> systemin in other members of the Solanaceae including potato, black nightshade and bell pepper. Systemins have only been identified in the Solaneae subtribe of the Solanaceae, but other members of the family, such as tobacco, also respond to wounding by systemically producing protease inhibitors.|$|E

5|$|Some {{species of}} {{parasitic}} wasp, {{especially in the}} Trichogrammatidae, are exploited commercially to provide biological control of insect pests. For example, in Brazil, farmers control sugarcane borers with the parasitic wasp Trichogramma galloi. One of the first species to be used was Encarsia formosa, a parasitoid {{of a range of}} species of whitefly. It entered commercial use in the 1920s in Europe, was overtaken by chemical pesticides in the 1940s, and again received interest from the 1970s. Encarsia is used especially in greenhouses to control whitefly pests <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> and cucumber, {{and to a lesser extent}} of aubergine (eggplant), flowers such as marigold, and strawberry. Several species of parasitic wasp are natural predators of aphids and can help to control them. For instance, Aphidius matricariae is used to control the peach-potato aphid.|$|E
5|$|A {{receptor}} for tomato systemin {{was identified}} as a 160KDa leucine-rich repeat receptor like kinase (LRR-RLK), SR160. After being isolated it was found that was very similar in structure to BRI1 from A. thaliana, the receptor that brassinolides bind to on the cell membrane. This was the first receptor which was found to be able to bind both a steroid and a peptide ligand and also to be involved in both defensive and developmental responses. Recent studies have found that the initial conclusion that BRI1 is the receptor for tomato systemin may be incorrect. In cu3 mutants <b>of</b> <b>tomato,</b> a null allele with a stop codon present in the extracellular LRR domain of BRI1 prevents the receptor from being localised correctly and it also lacks the kinase domain, required for signalling. These mutants are insensitive to brassinolide yet still respond to tomato systemin by producing protease inhibitors and causing an alkalisation response. This led Holton et al. to suggest that there is another mechanism by which systemin is perceived. Further investigation showed that binding of systemin to BRI1 does not cause the receptor to become phosphorylated, as when brassinolides bind, suggesting that it does not transduce a signal. When BRI1 is silenced in tomato, the plants have a similar phenotype to cu3 mutants yet are still able to respond normally to systemin, strengthening the view that BRI1 is not the systemin receptor.|$|E

When the first verse starts, Stefani's ex-lover (Terry Hall) walks by the house before sitting down on a swing. Stefani changes her shoes as the song's chorus is played; she walks away from the garage and down a street to a grocery store. At the store, she purchases four cans <b>of</b> <b>tomato</b> sauce, and quickly leaves. Meanwhile, Dumont, Kanal, and Young prepare a large dinner for the band as Stefani reenters the home. Stefani slices tomatoes, Dumont cooks some spaghetti noodles, Kanal cuts up a few onions, and Young sets the table. At the song's bridge, Stefani accidentally cuts herself with a knife and Kanal drops a pot of pasta sauce; both of them promptly clean up their messes as dinner is served. Dumont initiates a food fight, and touring members Gabrial McNair and Stephen Bradley join in. The video ends with the ex-lover sitting alone on the swing.|$|E
