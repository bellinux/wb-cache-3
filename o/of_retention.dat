5|$|The {{long-term}} {{complications that}} result from restoring teeth with implants relate, directly, to the risk factors of {{the patient and the}} technology. There are the risks associated with appearance including a high smile line, poor gingival quality and missing papillae, difficulty in matching the form of natural teeth that may have unequal points of contact or uncommon shapes, bone that is missing, atrophied or otherwise shaped in an unsuitable manner, unrealistic expectations of the patient or poor oral hygiene. The risks can be related to biomechanical factors, where the geometry of the implants does not support the teeth in the same way the natural teeth did such as when there are cantilevered extensions, fewer implants than roots or teeth that are longer than the implants that support them (a poor crown-to-root ratio). Similarly, grinding of the teeth, lack of bone or low diameter implants increase the biomechanical risk. Finally there are technological risks, where the implants themselves can fail due to fracture or a loss <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> to the teeth they are intended to support.|$|E

25|$|They are {{analogous}} to the calculation <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> factor for a paper chromatography separation, but describes how well HPLC separates a mixture into two or more components that are detected as peaks (bands) on a chromatogram. The HPLC parameters are the: efficiency factor(N), the retention factor (kappa prime), and the separation factor (alpha). Together the factors are variables in a resolution equation, which describes how well two components' peaks separated or overlapped each other. These parameters are mostly only used for describing HPLC reversed phase and HPLC normal phase separations, since those separations {{tend to be more}} subtle than other HPLC modes (e.g. ion exchange and size exclusion).|$|E
25|$|The vast {{majority}} of ectopic pregnancies implant in the Fallopian tube. Pregnancies can grow in the fimabrial end (5% of all ectopic pregnancies), the ampullary section (80%), the isthmus (12%), and the cornual and interstitial part of the tube (2%). Mortality of a tubal pregnancy at the isthmus or within the uterus (interstitial pregnancy) is higher as there is increased vascularity that may result more likely in sudden major internal bleeding. A review published in 2010 supports the hypothesis that tubal ectopic pregnancy {{is caused by a}} combination <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> of the embryo within the fallopian tube due to impaired embryo-tubal transport and alterations in the tubal environment allowing early implantation to occur.|$|E
25|$|Language {{retention}} is {{a common}} index to assimilation; according to the 2000 census, about 75 percent of all Hispanics spoke Spanish in the home.

The degree <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> of Spanish as the native language is based on recent arrival from countries where Spanish is spoken.

In the 21st century, the period of change seems cemented. A large public appeal has assured the preservation of Tyntesfield in 2002, and in 2007, Dumfries House and its collection were saved, after protracted appeals and debates. Today, demolition has ceased to be a realistic, or legal, option for listed buildings, and an historic house (particularly one with its contents intact) has become recognized as worthy <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> and preservation. However, many country houses are still at risk and their security, even as an entirety with their contents, is not guaranteed by any legislation.|$|E
25|$|Retention is the {{principle}} that describes how well the denture is prevented from moving vertically {{in the opposite direction}} of insertion. The better the topographical mimicry of the intaglio (interior) surface of the denture base {{to the surface of the}} underlying mucosa, the better the retention will be (in removable partial dentures, the clasps are a major provider <b>of</b> <b>retention),</b> as surface tension, suction and friction will aid in keeping the denture base from breaking intimate contact with the mucosal surface. It is important to note that the most critical element in the retentive design of a maxillary complete denture is a complete and total border seal (complete peripheral seal) in order to achieve 'suction'. The border seal is composed of the edges of the anterior and lateral aspects and the posterior palatal seal. The posterior palatal seal design is accomplished by covering the entire hard palate and extending not beyond the soft palate and ending 1–2mm from the vibrating line.|$|E
