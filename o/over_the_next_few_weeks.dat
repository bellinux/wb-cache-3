5|$|In May 7, 2007, Melina began feuding with Playboy {{cover girl}} Candice Michelle, {{after she was}} {{defeated}} in a tag team match alongside Victoria against Candice Michelle and Mickie James.

5|$|The {{internal}} {{disputes between}} the McMahons led to Linda McMahon {{being in a}} comatose and wheel-chair bound state due to the stress of being asked for a divorce by Vince, who {{took the opportunity to}} have a public affair with Trish Stratus. McMahon briefly feuded with Stratus, defeating her at No Way Out. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> Vince {{made it clear that he}} favored McMahon over Stratus, allowing McMahon to bully and verbally abuse Stratus. At WrestleMania X-Seven, Shane McMahon defeated Vince in a street fight. During the match, Stratus slapped Vince and chased Stephanie from ringside, apparently upset with Vince's constant misogynistic treatment of her.|$|E

5|$|Yet <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> Poland's risky, {{unconventional}} {{strategy at}} the August 1920 Battle of Warsaw halted the Soviet advance. The Polish plan {{was developed by}} Piłsudski and others, including Tadeusz Rozwadowski. Later, some supporters of Piłsudski would seek to portray him as the sole author of the Polish strategy, while opponents would seek to minimize his role. In the West {{for a long time}} a myth persisted that it was General Maxime Weygand of the French Military Mission to Poland who had saved Poland; modern scholars, however, are in agreement that Weygand's role was minimal at best.|$|E
5|$|In October, the Japanese again {{tried to}} {{recapture}} Henderson Field by delivering 15,000 more men—mainly from the Army's 2nd Infantry Division—to Guadalcanal. In addition to delivering {{the troops and}} their equipment by Tokyo Express runs, the Japanese also successfully pushed through one large convoy of slower transport ships. Enabling {{the approach of the}} transport convoy was a nighttime bombardment of Henderson Field by two battleships on 14 October that heavily damaged the airfield's runways, destroyed half of the CAF's aircraft, and burned most of the available aviation fuel. In spite of the damage, Henderson personnel were able to restore the two runways to service and replacement aircraft and fuel were delivered, gradually restoring the CAF to its pre-bombardment level <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b>|$|E
5|$|In early April 2002, the Hardy Boyz began a {{feud with}} Brock Lesnar after Lesnar gave Matt an F-5 on the steel {{entrance}} ramp, {{which led to}} an angered Hardy seeking revenge on Lesnar. At Backlash, Hardy faced-off against Lesnar in Lesnar's first televised match. Lesnar dominated Hardy and won the match by knockout. Lesnar and the Hardys continued to feud <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> with the Hardys coming out victorious only once by disqualification. At Judgment Day, Lesnar gained the upper hand on the Hardy Boyz before tagging his partner, Paul Heyman, in to claim the win for the team.

She then ran full–power sea trials before proceeding to the Virginia Capes, where she participated in another round of fleet maneuvers. Next, she departed for a European goodwill cruise on 26 October. She toured the Mediterranean Sea, stopping in Valletta, Malta, Naples, Italy, and Villefranche, France. She departed France on 30 November, and arrived in New York on 15 December. There, she went into dock at the New York Navy Yard for periodic repairs, which lasted until January 1914. On the 6th, Wyoming left for Hampton Roads, where she took on coal {{in preparation for the}} annual fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|By March, front-runner John McCain {{had secured}} enough pledged delegates to {{guarantee}} that he would win the nomination, and Romney and Huckabee had both formally withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, {{knew that it was}} now mathematically impossible for him to win the nomination, as he had captured only 20– 40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 for McCain, yet he refused to concede the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> Paul's supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and state party conventions over state party rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention. In one of the more dramatic moments, Nevada's state party leaders, outmaneuvered by Paul supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to the highly unusual measure of prematurely and abruptly shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, Moran {{introduced}} {{a bill that would}} restrict broadcast advertisements for erectile dysfunction or male enhancement medication. He said that such ads were indecent and should be prohibited on radio and television between the hours of 6am and 10pm, in accordance with Federal Communications Commission policy. Later that year, Moran and former presidential candidate and former Governor of Vermont Howard Dean held a town hall meeting on the issue of health care at South Lakes High School in Reston, Virginia. The meeting was interrupted several times by protesters, most notably pro-life activist Randall Terry, who, along with about half a dozen supporters, caused such a commotion that he had to be escorted out by police. The incident was replayed several times <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> on television {{as an example of the}} tension at town halls that fall.|$|E

5|$|On April 15, 2009, Ziggler {{was drafted}} to the SmackDown brand {{as part of}} the 2009 Supplemental Draft. He made his debut on the April 17 episode of SmackDown, {{defeating}} the United States Champion, Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) in a non-title match, and, as a result, the following week he demanded a match for the championship. On the May 1 episode of SmackDown, however, he failed to win the championship, after he was pinned by MVP. Ziggler then started a rivalry with The Great Khali, losing to him by disqualification after attacking Khali with a steel chair. As a result, Khali began coming out to the ring during and after Ziggler's matches, in attempt to gain revenge and to stop Ziggler from cheating. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> Ziggler defeated Khali by countout and disqualification after making it look like Khali had struck him with a steel chair. At The Bash pay-per-view, Ziggler defeated Khali by pinfall, after Kane interfered and attacked Khali.|$|E
5|$|On August 4, 2006, WWE {{announced}} that Hardy had re-signed with the company. In the following weeks, vignettes aired hyping his {{return on the}} August 21 episode of Raw. On {{the day of his}} return, Hardy received a push and defeated then-WWE Champion Edge by disqualification when Lita pulled Edge out of the ring. After failing to capture the Intercontinental Championship from Johnny Nitro <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> including at Unforgiven, Hardy finally defeated Nitro to win his second Intercontinental Championship on the October 2 episode of Raw. On the November 6 episode of Raw, Hardy lost the Intercontinental Championship back to Nitro, after Nitro hit him with the Intercontinental Championship title belt. One week later, Hardy regained it on the November 13 episode of Raw, with a crucifix pin. This marked Hardy's third reign as Intercontinental Champion.|$|E
5|$|On January 10, 2015, Benjamin, {{along with}} the rest of Suzuki-gun, took part in a major storyline, where the stable invaded a Pro Wrestling Noah show, attacking Marufuji and TMDK. Benjamin made his in-ring debut for Noah on January 12, when he, Suzuki, Taichi and Michinoku {{defeated}} Marufuji, Atsushi Kotoge, Muhammad Yone and Taiji Ishimori in an eight-man tag team match. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> Benjamin worked all Noah events, while starting a feud with Takashi Sugiura due to him also having a background in amateur wrestling. Benjamin and Sugiura finally met in a grudge match on July 18, where Sugiura was victorious. In November, Benjamin made it to the finals of Noah's premier singles tournament, the Global League Tournament, but was defeated there by Naomichi Marufuji. On June 12, 2016, Benjamin unsuccessfully challenged Go Shiozaki for Noah's top title, the GHC Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

5|$|On July 18, at the Money in the Bank pay-per-view, The Miz won a Money in the Bank ladder {{match to}} win a {{contract}} for a WWE Championship match that he could utilize at any time {{over the next year}} and became the first performer to win Money in the Bank while being a champion and the second, after Rob Van Dam, to hold a Money in the Bank contract and a title at the same time. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks,</b> The Miz attempted to cash in his Money in the Bank contract on the WWE Champion Sheamus, but was continually interrupted by other wrestlers before the matches could occur, which meant that he retained the contract for future use. Daniel Bryan returned to WWE at SummerSlam, taking The Miz's place on Team WWE, causing The Miz to attack him. This began a rivalry between the two, with The Miz losing the United States Championship to Bryan at the Night of Champions event in September. The following month, Miz defeated John Cena to become the captain of Team Raw, but at the Bragging Rights pay-per-view Team Raw—The Miz (with Alex Riley), R-Truth, John Morrison, Santino Marella, Sheamus, CM Punk, and Ezekiel Jackson—were unsuccessful in defeating Team SmackDown.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} Kościuszko Uprising began in March 1794, Zajączek joined Kościuszko in Luborzyca on 2 April. Zajączek {{was given the}} command of the Lesser Poland Division, and on 4 April he took part in battle of Racławice, which {{concluded}} with a major Polish victory. On 6 April {{he was promoted to}} lieutenant general. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> Zajączek accompanied Kościuszko and his staff. On 8 June he was defeated at the battle of Chełm and retreated toward Lublin. He lost support among the troops, and faced a mutiny, eventually quelled by Kościuszko, on 10 June. In mid June Zajączek's forces merged with those of Kościuszko. He commanded the forces in the inconclusive battle of Gołków on 9–10 July, and soon after {{he was one of the}} Polish commanders of the defense of Warsaw that lasted from mid July until early September. In the following few weeks Zajączek became one of the members of the Supreme National Council, and a president of its Criminal Court. He was a commander of the defense of Warsaw during the disastrous battle of Praga of 4 November. During the battle Zajączek was wounded and retreated from the battle even before the conflict was over. He has been criticised for his insufficient preparation for the defense of Warsaw against Russian invasion, and for poor leadership during the battle. Zajączek escaped to Polish Galicia where he was interned by Austrians. He was released one year later, moving to Paris.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June, {{a letter}} arrived from William Tayler, the {{commissioner}} of Patna district, warning that an outbreak of mutiny from the Bengal Native Infantry units in Dinapore was to be expected. The European population in Arrah spent {{that night at the}} house of Arthur Littledale, a judge working in Arrah, and during the night it was decided that the European women and children were to be sent by boat to Dinapore, escorted by armed members of the European male population, where they would be taken into the care of the 10th Regiment of Foot—this decision was acted upon on the 9th. The following morning a meeting was held at the house of Herwald Wake, the magistrate of Shahabad district, to discuss what to do next. The East India Company civil servants stated that they did not intend to abandon the town and they would remain. All but two of the remaining European male residents of Arrah who were not civil servants or Government employees decided to leave for the relative safety of Dinapore by boat or on horseback and did so the same day. This reduced the European male population of Arrah to eight, rising to sixteen <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> as men arrived in the town from the surrounding district. The defence of the town was augmented on 11 June when a party arrived consisting of 50 sepoys and 6 sowars from the Bengal Military Police Battalion, known as Rattray's Sikhs (now the 3rd Battalion of the Sikh Regiment, Indian Army), under the command of Jemadar Hooken Singh. The party had been sent from Dinapore, part of a larger detachment under their commander Captain Rattray whose presence in the area had been personally requested by Tayler, and placed under the direct command of Wake.|$|E
