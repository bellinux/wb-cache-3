This is a rate of 7.85 per 100,000 population—a major decrease from 1980 when a homicide rate of 34.2 per 100,000 was reported. This included 15 officer-involved shootings. One shooting led {{to the death of}} a SWAT team member, Randal Simmons, the first in LAPD's history. Los Angeles in the year of 2013 totaled 251 murders, a decrease of 16 percent from the previous year. Police speculate that the drop resulted from a number of factors, including young people spending more time <b>online.</b> <b>Crime</b> increased significantly in 2015 from the low in 2013 with the rate of aggravated assault up 76%, rape up 182.7% and murder up 9.2%.|$|E

Systematic information management and protection are required in order to minimize the damages caused by such online threats in this new IT age. This thesis proposes essential security measures for planning and designing new IT services, not to mention pre-installation services, while applying Zigbee to KISA’s preliminary diagnosis of an information protection model that secures stability and reliability before installation. Analysis of Zigbee, a wireless PAN technology, regarding its weaknesses and the related countermeasures, and real-world examples of Zigbee’s application to u-services will also be dealt with in this work...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} a high-level evaluation of organised {{crime and the}} threats arising from <b>online</b> organised <b>crime,</b> within a multi-disciplinary perspective. It draws {{on a range of}} academic, industry and other materials to distinguish the key characteristics of <b>online</b> organised <b>crime</b> and to identify some of the multi-disciplinary resources which are available to counter it. Real-life case studies and other examples, together with the Tables in the Appendices, are used to demonstrate how contemporary <b>online</b> organised <b>crime</b> is profit-driven and has a strong commercial focus. The paper is accompanied by a series of Appendices and Glossaries and a comprehensive Reference list (provided within a separate document to facilitate crossreferencing with this paper) that includes suggestions for further reading and research. Section Three begins by demonstrating how there are many possible approaches which can be taken towards organised crime, which may at first appear confusing, contradictory or overwhelming. It mentions that law enforcement is adopting a multidisciplinary approach and working in partnership with other sectors, including the business sector, to counter the problem. Next, the paper attempts to separate the ‘fact from the fiction’ of organised crime, highlighting the pitfalls of relying on any single source (for instance, media reports or statistics) when analysing the subject. It identifies reliable sources for information about organised crime (for instance, the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organised Crime and several established, academic sources) and aggregates some of the key organised crime characteristics from the sources within Tables 1 to 6 in Appendix A. Having established that, despite initial impressions, it is possible to obtain a consensus view about theoretical organised crime characteristics within carefully-defined parameters, the project aligns the theoretical criteria against real-life <b>online</b> organised <b>crime</b> case studies. This establishes that, although there are many similarities between terrestrial and <b>online</b> organised <b>crime</b> groups (OOCGs), the online groups also display characteristics which are unique to them, for instance a high dependence {{on the use of the}} Internet and transnational strategies. With regard to online involvement by ‘traditional’ organised crime groups such as the Mafia, the paper highlights that, although there is some indication in both the theoretical literature and the case studies that traditional organised crime groups are targeting the Internet, the evidence in the case studies suggests that involvement of traditional organised crime groups is not a dominant feature at the moment. In Section Four, the paper assumes a non-technical IS perspective and describes some of the vulnerable elements within information technology, especially within the structures of the Internet and the Web, which all offenders, including OOCGs, are exploiting. It explains some of the reasons why these vulnerabilities exist and why they are attractive to offenders. In particular, it highlights the serious threat which crimeware, which is often sold and distributed by OOCGs, poses to the Web environment. In Section Five, the paper shifts to a business perspective, emphasising the importance of understanding <b>online</b> organised <b>crime</b> business models and mentioning the work of particular authors whose work in this field adopts a multi-disciplinary approach. The paper then uses Morphological Analysis (MA) to demonstrate how a multidisciplinary approach to strategic analysis can utilise the skills and experience of IS/business professionals, as well as assisting them to manage the threat which OOCGs may pose to their business. The paper concludes with the observation from academic and industry sources that directly targeting the profit-making aspects of an <b>online</b> organised <b>crime</b> business may be one of the most effective responses to the problem...|$|R
