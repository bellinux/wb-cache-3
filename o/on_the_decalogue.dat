5000|$|Jeshua's {{activity}} {{in the domain of}} Bible exegesis was very extensive. He translated the Pentateuch into Arabic, and wrote thereon an exhaustive commentary, of which he made, in 1054, an abridged version. In this commentary, Jeshua made use of all the exegetical works of his Karaite predecessors and of that of Saadia Gaon, often attacking the latter most vigorously. Several passages of Jeshua's commentary are quoted by Abraham ibn Ezra. Fragments of the Pentateuch translation and of the exhaustive commentary on a part of Leviticus, with almost the whole of the abridged version, are extant in manuscript in the British Museum (MSS. Or. 2491; 2494, ii; 2544-46). Both commentaries were early translated into Hebrew; and parts of them are in the Firkovich collection at St. Petersburg. Jeshua wrote two other Biblical works, an Arabic commentary <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> (which he reproduced in an abridged form); and a philosophical midrash entitled [...] "Bereshit Rabbah," [...] in which he discusses, {{in the spirit of the}} Mutazilite [...] "kalam," [...] creation, the existence and unity of God, the divine attributes, etc. A fragment of a Hebrew translation of the abridged commentary <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue,</b> made by Tobiah ben Moses under the title [...] "Pitron 'Aseret ha-Debarim," [...] is still extant in manuscript ("Cat.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{highlight}} the significance of the prohibition of making any image of God as found in the second commandment of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> in Exodus 20 : 4 - 6 with its inner-biblical interpretations in Exodus 32 : 1 - 6 and in Isaiah 40 : 18 - 20. This study has discussed the close connection between the prohibition of making any image of God in the second commandment of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue,</b> <b>the</b> idea of Yahweh’s incomparability in the introduction and the command to worship God only in the first commandment. God’s incomparability prevents Israel from worshipping any other god by making images of them or making any image of God. The ‘construct of the introduction and the first two commandments of the Decalogue’ serves as a linchpin concept in our understanding of the prohibition of making any image of God. The aniconism matriculated in the second commandment of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> in Exodus 20 : 4 - 6 in relation with the introduction and the first commandment in Exodus 20 : 2 - 3 forms the basis for the prohibition of making any image of God from the Sinai event onwards. This construct in Exodus 20 : 2 - 6 is shared with Exodus 32 : 1 - 6 and Isaiah 40 : 18 - 20. There an inner-biblical interpretation of the aniconism of the second commandment of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> in Exodus 20 : 4 - 6 in reaction with the introduction and the first commandment in Exodus 20 : 2 - 3 explicates and applies the meaning of the command in a new situation. Chapter 1 deals with the statement of the problem and the hypothesis of this study, its methodology, theological rationale, and the {{aim of this}} study. Chapter 2 discusses that the prohibition of making any image of God in the second commandment of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> in Exodus 20 : 4 - 6 is important, not only as a phenomenon in the Pentateuch, but also as the provenance of aniconism in the rest of Old Testament. Exodus 20 : 4 - 6 can be considered as the explicit traceable provenance of the prohibition of making any image of God in the Pentateuch and the rest of Old Testament. The ‘introduction and first two commandments of the Decaologue construct’ provides a framework within which the meaning of the prohibition of making any image of God in the second commandment can be understood in the context of the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> in Exodus and the first commandment of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue.</b> <b>The</b> second commandment of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> is sometimes backed up by only the first commandment of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> and sometimes by both of them. The origin of the second commandment of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> in Exodus 20 : 4 - 6 as the prohibition of making any image of God whether it comes from the early or later stages of Israel’s history is discussed with <b>the</b> discussion <b>on</b> <b>the</b> arrangement of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> in <b>the</b> Sinai pericope (Ex 19 : 1 - 24 : 11) and the relation between <b>the</b> two <b>Decalogues</b> in Exodus 20 : 2 - 17 and Deuteronomy 5 : 6 - 21. The sharp differences of opinions <b>on</b> <b>the</b> provenance of the prohibition in the second commandment of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> in Exodus 20 : 4 - 6 is dealt with. This study supposes that the dating of <b>the</b> prohibition <b>on</b> making any image of God of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> should be attributed to Moses’ time as stated in the text of the Pentateuch. Chapter 3 deals with one key Pentateuchal text for the prohibition of making any image of God, Exodus 32 : 1 - 6, as an example that the second commandment represents <b>the</b> prohibition <b>on</b> making any image of God in relation with the introduction and the first commandment of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> proclaiming God’s incomparability, which is called ‘the introduction and the first two commandments of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> construct’ in this study. Exodus 32 : 1 - 6 is regarded to be an interpretation of the prohibition of making any image of God in the second commandment of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> in Exodus 20 : 4 - 6. Chapter 4 deals with Isaiah 40 : 18 - 20, which forbids idol-fabrication and the worship of an image of God in its relation with the proclamation of God’s incomparability, as well as with the worship of other gods and their images. This chapter deals with the similarity of the negative attitude toward worship of God through images found in the legal and prophetical parts of the Hebrew Bible. Theologically speaking, Isaiah’s message is in line with the Pentateuch, and flows from the office of the prophet as a plenipotentiary of God to condemn the transgression of the covenantal law. This similarity of the idea between them is seen in respect of its linguistic aspects. Considering the rules of the nature of analogies between texts, there can be seen a correlation between the introduction and first two commandments of <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue</b> in Exodus 20 : 2 - 6 and the passage dealing with the incomparability of God and the idol-fabrication in Isaiah 40 : 18 - 20. The final chapter summarizes the flow of the argument in this thesis dealing with three phenomena of aniconism in the Old Testament and suggests the conclusion of this thesis based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> result of the exegetical and thematic study <b>on</b> <b>the</b> three passages.

50|$|Some {{believe that}} the person or group {{responsible}} for the inscription had to have an extensive knowledge of the Hebrew language.

After Wyrick's death, Colonel Charles Whittlesey published a paper in 1872 in which he recalls discovering a Hebrew bible among Wyrick's personal items. Whittlesey concludes at the time that the stones were a hoax, and assumed that the bible was Wyrick's source of inspiration for the inscription.

50|$|In Palestinian sources Joshua answers various {{questions}} of the emperor: how God created the world (Genesis Rabbah x.), concerning the angels (ib. lxxviii., beginning; Lamentations Rabbah iii. 21), as to {{the resurrection of the}} body (Genesis Rabbah xxviii.; Ecclesiastes Rabbah xii. 5), and with reference to the Decalogue (Pesikta Rabbati 21). In the Babylonian Talmud three conversations are related, which resemble that <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Decalogue,</b> in that Joshua silences the emperor's mockery of the Jewish conception of God by proving to him God's incomparable greatness and majesty (Hullin 59b, 60a). Joshua also rebukes the emperor's daughter when she mocks at the God of the Jews (ib. 60a); in another place she is made to repent for having mocked Joshua's appearance (Ta'anit on Ned. 50b). The emperor's question concerning the odor of Sabbath food is a mocking one (Shab. 119a). Once Joshua told the emperor that he would dream of the Parthians (Berakhot 56a). At another time he excused his own non-appearance at a meeting by cleverly describing the infirmities of his old age (Shab. 152a). In one conversation, preserved by a later authority (Adolf Jellinek, B. H. v. 132), Joshua defended the justice of God, which was doubted by the emperor. Once a dispute in pantomime took place in the emperor's palace between Joshua and a Judæo-Christian ("Min"), in which Joshua maintained that God's protective hand was still stretched over Israel (Hagigah 5b). In another conversation Joshua defended the honor of Israel against a heretic, who had attacked it, by quoting from Micah vii. 4 (Eruvin 101a).|$|E
