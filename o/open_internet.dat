25|$|In December 2010, the FCC {{revised the}} {{principles}} {{from the original}} Internet policy statement and adopted the <b>Open</b> <b>Internet</b> Order consisting of three rules regarding the Internet: Transparency. Fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose the network management practices, performance characteristics, and terms and conditions of their broadband services; No blocking. Fixed broadband providers may not block lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices; mobile broadband providers may not block lawful websites, or block applications that compete with their voice or video telephony services; and No unreasonable discrimination.|$|E

25|$|On February 10, 2014, Netflix updated its ISP speed rankings with January 2014 {{data that}} show the average access speed via Verizon FiOS traffic was dropped down between December 2013 and January 2014.

2500|$|These {{tenets of}} <b>open</b> <b>internet</b> {{essentially}} encapsulate {{the ideas of}} net neutrality. From 2005 until the establishment of <b>Open</b> <b>Internet</b> in December 2010, these standards existed in name only. [...] In 2009, FCC Commissioner Julius Genachowski revamped these principles by adding the idea that internet service providers may not discriminate against content in any way. [...] After an extensive debate about the viability of net neutrality, the FCC approved <b>Open</b> <b>Internet</b> on December 21, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|The court first defines {{their task}} as, [...] "not {{to assess the}} wisdom of the <b>Open</b> <b>Internet</b> Order regulations, but rather to {{determine}} whether the Commission has demonstrated that the regulations fall within the scope of its statutory grant of authority." [...] The court then sets about breaking up the FCC <b>Open</b> <b>Internet</b> Order 2010 into its constituent parts and either vacating or upholding each part.|$|E
2500|$|The court vacated {{two parts}} of the FCC <b>Open</b> <b>Internet</b> Order 2010, {{determining}} that the FCC did not have the authority to impose these orders without classifying network providers as common carriers. Since the FCC had previously classified broadband providers as [...] "information services" [...] and not [...] "telecommunications services," [...] they could not be regulated as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. Therefore, the FCC <b>Open</b> <b>Internet</b> Order 2010 regulations, which could only be applied to common carriers, could not be applied to broadband providers. The court upheld the transparency order of the FCC <b>Open</b> <b>Internet</b> Order 2010, which it found was not contingent upon network operators being classified as common carriers.|$|E

2500|$|The Federal Communications Commission <b>Open</b> <b>Internet</b> Order {{is a set}} of {{regulations}} that move towards the establishment of the internet neutrality concept. Some opponents of net neutrality believe such internet regulation would inhibit innovation by preventing providers from capitalizing on their broadband investments and reinvesting that money into higher quality services for consumers. Supporters of net neutrality argue that the presence of content restrictions by network providers represents a threat to individual expression and the rights of the First Amendment. <b>Open</b> <b>Internet</b> strikes a balance between these two camps by creating a compromised set {{of regulations}} that treats all internet traffic in [...] "roughly the same way". In Verizon v. FCC, the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated portions of the order that the court determined could only be applied to common carriers.|$|E
