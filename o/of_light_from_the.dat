5|$|Natural rubies are {{corundum}} (aluminum oxide) crystals {{that are}} colored red (the rarest type) due to chromium (III) ions (other colors of corundum gems are termed sapphires). A red-colored artificial ruby {{may also be}} achieved by doping chromium(III) into artificial corundum crystals, thus making chromium a requirement for making synthetic rubies. Such a synthetic ruby crystal {{was the basis for}} the first laser, produced in 1960, which relied on stimulated emission <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> chromium atoms in such a crystal.|$|E
5|$|The first {{quantitative}} {{estimate of}} the speed of light was made in 1676 by Rømer (see Rømer's determination of the speed <b>of</b> <b>light).</b> <b>From</b> <b>the</b> observation that the periods of Jupiter's innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of , 26% lower than the actual value.|$|E
5|$|Depth and {{dimension}} are rendered {{by the use}} {{of linear}} perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century French philosopher and cultural critic Michel Foucault observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For José Ortega y Gasset, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.|$|E

5|$|The Doctor and Clara {{attend the}} ceremony, where the Doctor {{explains}} {{that since the}} Rings were settled {{there has been a}} constant song sung to keep an angry god asleep. The people fear that the god, which they call Grandfather, will awaken and consume the entire universe if the song is ever interrupted. Merry begins singing, joined by a chorister at the pyramid. During the song, a mummy in a glass case at the pyramid begins to awaken. Merry panics, believing she got the song wrong. A beam <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> pyramid envelops her, and she is pulled toward the pyramid and the mummy. The Doctor and Clara find Dor'een and rent the space bike using Clara's mother's ring as payment. They ride the bike to the pyramid where they find the mummy struggling to escape the case and consume Merry's soul. The Doctor promises Merry that she does not have to sacrifice herself and that he will stop Grandfather. As they attempt to leave, a group of creatures called the Vigil arrive and attempt to force Merry to sacrifice herself. The Doctor holds the Vigil at bay long enough to let Clara and Merry escape from the throne room, but then the case shatters and the mummy breaks free. A ray of light strikes the planet, revealing that Grandfather is Akhaten itself, a planet-sized parasitic creature.|$|E
5|$|The party {{arrives at}} a giant Mechat base in the clouds and are tossed into the throne room of Nene, the {{apparent}} leader. Nene explains to them how he enjoys hearing the screams of the dying victims of the Land Shark. The party battles Nene, but are easily defeated. They are {{thrown out of the}} base and start to fall to their deaths, but a beam <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> base catches them, and brings them back to the base. The party find three small floating spheres {{in the middle of the}} room; a mysterious voice commands them to swallow the spheres. The party refuses, and instead hold onto the spheres for safekeeping. As they try to reach another Mechat to escape the base, they are forced to fight a large army of Nene's robots. When the battle seems it will never end, and with the unseen voice promising them knowledge of how to pilot the Mechat, the party members eat the spheres. As they consume the spheres, a strange transformation occurs to each, changing the forms of their shadows into powerful beings that are able to destroy the robot army. The party escapes the base and crash in a desert.|$|E

25|$|In astronomy, the {{diameter}} of the aperture stop (called the aperture) is a critical parameter in the design of a telescope. Generally, one would want the aperture to be as large as possible, to collect the maximum amount <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> distant objects being imaged. The size of the aperture is limited, however, in practice by considerations of cost and weight, as well as prevention of aberrations (as mentioned above).|$|E

Vikings used birefringent crystals of Iceland spar to navigate across the Atlantic Ocean by this method {{at about the}} same time. Iceland spar is found in China, as well as in Iceland and some other places. Insects such as bees can respond to sky polarization and use it to find their way home. Whether the Chinese used it is hypothetical, but it is certainly possible.|$|E
25|$|Special {{relativity}} also {{predicts that}} two light rays traveling {{in opposite directions}} around a spinning closed path (e.g. a loop) require different flight times {{to come back to}} the moving emitter/receiver (this is a consequence of the independence of the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> velocity of the source, see above). This effect was actually observed and is called the Sagnac effect. Currently, the consideration of this effect is necessary for many experimental setups and for the correct functioning of GPS.|$|E

25|$|Einstein {{predicted}} the gravitational redshift <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> equivalence principle in 1907, {{and it was}} predicted that this effect might be measured in the spectral lines of a white dwarf star, which has a very high gravitational field. Initial attempts to measure the gravitational redshift of the spectrum of Sirius-B, were done by Walter Sydney Adams in 1925, but the result was criticized as being unusable due to the contamination from light from the (much brighter) primary star, Sirius. The first accurate measurement of the gravitational redshift of a white dwarf was done by Popper in 1954, measuring a 21km/sec gravitational redshift of 40 Eridani B.|$|E
25|$|Another {{example is}} the Sagnac effect. Two signals were sent in {{opposite}} directions around a rotating platform. After their arrival a displacement of the interference fringes occurs. Sagnac himself believed that he had proved {{the existence of the}} aether. However, special relativity can easily explain this effect. When viewed from an inertial frame of reference, it is a simple consequence of the independence of the speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> speed of the source, since the receiver runs away from one beam, while it approaches the other beam. When viewed from a rotating frame, the assessment of simultaneity changes during the rotation, and consequently the speed of light is not constant in accelerated frames.|$|E
25|$|In the 1920s, {{a series}} of Michelson–Morley type {{experiments}} were conducted, confirming relativity to even higher precision than the original experiment. Another type of interferometer experiment was the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment in 1932, by which {{the independence of the}} speed <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> velocity of the apparatus was confirmed. Also time dilation was directly measured in the Ives–Stilwell experiment in 1938 and by measuring the decay rates of moving particles in 1940. All of those experiments have been repeated several times with increased precision. In addition, that the speed of light is unreachable for massive bodies was measured in many tests of relativistic energy and momentum. Therefore, knowledge of those relativistic effects is required in the construction of particle accelerators.|$|E

25|$|Plato first {{articulated}} the emission theory, {{the idea that}} visual perception is accomplished by rays emitted by the eyes. He also commented on the parity reversal of mirrors in Timaeus. Some hundred years later, Euclid wrote a treatise entitled Optics where he linked vision to geometry, creating geometrical optics. He based his work on Plato's emission theory wherein he described the mathematical rules of perspective and described the effects of refraction qualitatively, although he questioned that a beam <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> eye could instantaneously light up the stars every time someone blinked. Ptolemy, in his treatise Optics, held an extramission-intromission theory of vision: the rays (or flux) from the eye formed a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field. The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back to the observer’s intellect about the distance and orientation of surfaces. He summarised much of Euclid {{and went on to}} describe a way to measure the angle of refraction, though he failed to notice the empirical relationship between it and the angle of incidence.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, Erdrick {{arrived at}} Tantegel Castle {{to speak with}} King Lorik and offered his help to defeat the Dragonlord. After searching the land for clues to the Dragonlord's whereabouts, Erdrick found that the Dragonlord lived on an island that could be accessed only via a magical bridge that only a [...] "Rainbow Drop" [...] could generate. After venturing to the island, Erdrick was never heard from again. Many years later, during King LorikXVI's reign, the Dragonlord attacked the kingdom again and captured Princess Gwaelin. Many heroes tried to rescue the princess and recover the Ball <b>of</b> <b>Light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Dragonlord's castle, called Charlock, but none succeeded. The prophet Mahetta predicted that [...] "One day, a descendant of the valiant Erdrick shall come forth to defeat the Dragonlord." [...] However, when the descendant (the game's hero) arrives, {{many of the people}} of Alefgard have forgotten the story of Erdrick, and those few who do remember consider it a myth and do not believe in Mahetta's prophecy. King Lorik starts to mourn the decline of his kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Indirectly, {{the effect}} of {{gravitational}} waves had been detected in observations of specific binary stars. Such pairs of stars orbit each other and, as they do so, gradually lose energy by emitting gravitational waves. For ordinary stars like the Sun, this energy loss would be {{too small to be}} detectable, but this energy loss was observed in 1974 in a binary pulsar called PSR1913+16. In such a system, one of the orbiting stars is a pulsar. This has two consequences: a pulsar is an extremely dense object known as a neutron star, for which gravitational wave emission is much stronger than for ordinary stars. Also, a pulsar emits a narrow beam of electromagnetic radiation from its magnetic poles. As the pulsar rotates, its beam sweeps over the Earth, where it is seen as a regular series of radio pulses, just as a ship at sea observes regular flashes <b>of</b> <b>light</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rotating light in a lighthouse. This regular pattern of radio pulses functions as a highly accurate [...] "clock". It can be used to time the double star's orbital period, and it reacts sensitively to distortions of spacetime in its immediate neighborhood.|$|E

500|$|Spielberg {{devised the}} three trials that guard the Grail. For the first, the blades under which Indiana ducks like a {{penitent}} man were {{a mix of}} practical and miniature blades created by Gibbs and ILM.

This was filmed and deemed unsatisfactory, so ILM filmed a stuntman hanging through a hole that appears in the floor, 30 feet above a cavern. As this was dark, it did not matter that the matte painting and models were rushed late in production. The third trial, the leap of faith that Indiana makes over an apparently impassable ravine after discovering a bridge hidden by forced perspective, was created with a model bridge and painted backgrounds.
