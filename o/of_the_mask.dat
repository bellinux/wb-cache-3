5|$|Bionicle: Mask of Light, stylized as BIONICLE: Mask of Light— The Movie, is a 2003 direct-to-video science fantasy action film {{based on}} the Bionicle toy series created by Lego. Set in a {{universe}} filled with bio-mechanical beings allied with classical element-themed tribes, the story follows two friends from the fire-based village of Ta-Koro on a quest to find the owner <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> of Light, a mystical artifact that can potentially defeat Makuta, an evil entity threatening the island. The story is {{based on the}} latter half of the toyline's 2002–2003 narrative.|$|E
5|$|The Mask of Light {{takes place}} on a {{tropical}} island in the Bionicle universe. According to legend, the Great Spirit Mata Nui created the island's masked Matoran inhabitants. Mata Nui was sent into a coma by his envious spirit brother Makuta, who began a reign of terror on the island until six guardians known as Toa freed the island from his regime. The Matoran, alongside the Toa and Turaga leaders, live in Element-themed regions of the island. The events <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> of Light takes place during {{the latter half of}} the toyline's 2002–2003 narrative.|$|E

Orchestrating the events of the story, he searched Hell for this power until an evil force entered him and expanded his knowledge of the dark arts, which allowed him to cast the spell that separated the Earth from the Heavens so that the Spirits would contact the Brotherhood. Zobek discloses he used the Devil Mask on Gabriel to kill Marie and that all he needed was for Gabriel to restore the power of the Spirits to avoid suspicion from them. Satan (Jason Isaacs) emerges and takes the God Mask from Zobek, revealing himself as the mastermind who gave Zobek his powers so that Satan could have revenge on God and return to the Heavens. Gabriel confronts Satan and defeats him, releasing souls of the deceased from limbo. Gabriel discovers the God Mask cannot bring Marie back and that it only allows him to see through God's eyes. Marie tells him he has been given a new life to redeem himself before she departs with the God Mask.|$|E

25|$|Equalising <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> is an {{essential}} skill for any form of diving. Goggles that do not cover the nose can not be equalised and are unsuitable for diving. The mask is equalised by exhaling sufficient air through the nose to provide a balanced internal pressure. Any excess will simply leak out around the skirt. Equalising (or clearing) the ears is necessary to prevent barotrauma to the middle and inner ear. Some divers need to pinch the nostrils closed {{as part of their}} equalisation technique, and this must be allowed for in the design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> skirt.|$|E

25|$|As a diver descends, {{they must}} {{periodically}} exhale through their nose to equalise the internal pressure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> {{with that of}} the surrounding water. Swimming goggles are not suitable for diving because they only cover the eyes and thus do not allow for equalisation. Failure to equalise the pressure inside the mask may lead to a form of barotrauma known as mask squeeze.|$|E
25|$|Masks are {{typically}} tested for fit before use. After a mask is fitted, {{it is often}} tested by various challenge agents. Isoamyl acetate, a synthetic banana flavourant, and camphor are often used as innocuous challenge agents.

Both relative and absolute depth perception are reduced underwater. Loss of contrast results in overestimation, and magnification effects account for underestimation at short range.|$|E
25|$|Elizabeth Graham {{would play}} ice hockey for Queen's University and is {{credited}} {{as being the}} first goaltender ever to wear a mask for protection.

25|$|When {{entering}} the water while wearing the mask, the diver {{may need to}} manually prevent water impact from dislodging or knocking off the mask. Alternatively, a diver can enter the water with the mask off {{and then put it}} on or use an entry method which does not result in fast water flow over the mask. Wearing the mask pushed up onto the forehead while out of the water or on the surface increases the risk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> falling or being knocked off.|$|E
