National efforts to date have been corrupted by partisan politics that have prevented us from devising effective, executable, supportable solutions. At times, these partisan struggles have led to political decisions that endangered {{the lives of our}} sons and daughters on the battlefield. The unmistakable message was that political power had a greater priority than our national security objectives. Overcoming this strategic failure {{is the first step toward}} achieving victory in Iraq without bipartisan cooperation we are doomed to fail. There is nothing going <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> that would give us hope.|$|E

50|$|La Follette {{made several}} {{decisions}} that hurt his primary campaign.

Being initially confident of victory, he further hurt his chances by staying <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> to draft and win passage of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 rather than returning to Wisconsin to campaign for re-election.|$|E

5000|$|Human Events was former U.S. President Ronald Reagan's [...] "favorite {{reading for}} years," [...] writes biographer Richard Reeves.

[...] Reagan contributed some articles to Human Events in the 1970s. During the 1980 presidential campaign, Democrats released a document entitled [...] "Ronald Reagan, Extremist Collaborator—An Exposé," [...] in which, according to biographer Lee Edwards, [...] "among the proofs of Reagan's extremism was that he read the conservative weekly Human Events." [...] After being elected President, Reagan would occasionally write or call Winter or Ryskind.|$|E
50|$|In 1944, {{brothers}} Nesuhi and Ahmet Ertegun {{elected to}} remain in the United States when their mother and sister returned to Turkey, following the death of their father Munir Ertegun, who had been the first Turkish Ambassador to the United States. The brothers had become ardent fans of jazz and rhythm & blues music, amassing a collection of over 15,000 78 RPM records. Ahmet ostensibly stayed <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> to undertake post-graduate music studies at Georgetown University but immersed himself in the Washington music scene and decided to enter the record business, then enjoying a resurgence after wartime restrictions on the shellac used in manufacture. He convinced the family dentist, Dr Vahdi Sabit, to invest $10,000 and recruited Herb Abramson, a dentistry student.|$|E

Because, obviously, throwing Jack Abramoff in jail didn't clean up the system", adding [...] "I had something to give back, some way to make some recompense for what I was by telling what is going <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> - {{from the point of view}} of somebody who rose very high in that industry - and what goes on behind those doors, and how horrible it really is." ...|$|E

5000|$|On September 13, 2011, Hughes {{called upon}} then Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott to {{investigate}} a new air pollution rule of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Abbott indicated that he is already checking into the issue raised by Hughes. According to Hughes, the rule if implemented had the potential of producing blackouts, increasing costs to consumers, and creating job losses. Hughes added that the directive would cause the Luminant utility company to shut down operations in his own district as well as across the state. Hughes continued, [...] "I don't know what's going <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> {{but here in the}} real world, money is tight, and families are struggling[...] [...] [...] As if the job losses weren’t enough, these new rules will also raise electric rates - {{in the middle of a}} recession." ...|$|E
50|$|He was gazetted {{secretary}} of legation at Vienna in 1828, but refused this appointment to become first minister-plenipotentiary and envoy-extraordinary at Buenos Aires then Rio de Janeiro (with {{the civil war}} delaying his departure until 1831). He was there from 1831 to 1836, {{when he moved to}} be British ambassador to the United States of America, in the midst of disputes over slavery and Canada that seemed likely to lead to war. Fox did not enjoy his American posting and became more and more reclusive (though he did take up botanical collecting), but he still objected to Robert Peel's government sending Lord Ashburton to settle the north-eastern boundary dispute over Fox's head. He was retired from the post in 1843 to clear the way to a successful treaty to solve the Oregon dispute. He stayed <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington,</b> where he died from a drug overdose in 1846 and was buried in the Congressional Cemetery, passing his botanical collection to his nephew Sir Charles James Fox Bunbury.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{inside the}} NSA had argued {{internally}} {{that the time}} had come to publicly release the details of the Venona project, but it was not until 1995 that the bipartisan Commission on Government Secrecy, with Senator Moynihan as chairman, released Venona project materials. Moynihan wrote:"The secrecy system has systematically denied American historians access to the records of American history. Of late we find ourselves relying on archives of the former Soviet Union in Moscow to resolve questions of what was going <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington</b> at mid-century. ... the Venona intercepts contained overwhelming proof of the activities of Soviet spy networks in America, complete with names, dates, places, and deeds."One of the considerations in releasing Venona translations was the privacy interests of the individuals mentioned, referenced, or identified in the translations. Some names were not released because to do so would constitute an invasion of privacy.However, in at least one case, independent researchers identified one of the subjects whose name had been obscured by the NSA.|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{exploration}} of the city form of Washington. D. C. through four independent essays. Each essay examines a different aspect of the city: its monumentality as determined by its relationship with the nation it governs. the linear network of its plan, the 'abjectness' of its principal buildings, and finally. the significance of nature. Their structure {{and the manner in which}} they view the city are tailored to their respective topics. Together they represent a body of work whose intent is to explore those issues which distinguish Washington. The premise for this approach is a belief that cities should be understood for what they are. not only for what they are like or what they are not. To this end. the thesis examines what is going <b>on</b> <b>in</b> <b>Washington.</b> so that we may understand it and work with it, rather than transfer attractive 'solutions' from other cities which may be inappropriate. by George Kousoulas.
