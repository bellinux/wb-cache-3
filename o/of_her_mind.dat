5|$|The {{interior}} sets of {{the boats}} were not built specifically for the programme, but were pulled together from stock items from various prop warehouses. Cumming had originally hoped to simulate the rocking of the ships by mounting the sets on rollers but the idea was dropped due to costs, with the effect achieved by moving the cameras instead. The photo of Tegan's Aunt Vanessa, one of the items created by Marriner from the contents <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> was shot specifically for the filming, requiring Dolore Whiteman (who had played the character in Logopolis) to be contracted for a one-day photoshoot. The models {{of the boats}}, used in the racing sequences, were props sourced by visual effects designer Mike Kelt following extensive research at the National Maritime Museum. The ships were mounted on rods for filming, while the oars were battery operated. The model of Davey's ship remained intact, with explosion being a filmed effect that was edited into the sequence. Kelt {{was shocked by the}} dilapidated state of the TARDIS console prop, and was worried about damaging it while filming the explosion from Part One, and asked producer John Nathan-Turner if he could replace it but was told there was no money available.|$|E
25|$|In 1880, in a Harper and {{brothers}} review, it was said:-"Sedgwick has marked individuality; she writes {{with a higher}} aim than merely to amuse. Indeed, the rare endowments <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> depend in an unusual degree upon the moral qualities {{with which they are}} united for their value. Animated by a cheerful philosophy, and anxious to pour its sunshine into every place where there is lurking care or suffering, she selects for illustration the scenes of everyday experience, paints them with exact fidelity, and seeks to diffuse over the mind a delicious serenity, and in the heart kind feelings and sympathies, and wise ambition and steady hope. Her style is colloquial, picturesque, and marked by a facile grace which is evidently a gift of nature. Her characters are nicely drawn and delicately contrasted, her delineation of manners decidedly the best that has appeared.|$|E

She is a popular soccer player and also teaches and trains the mutant students of Xavier Institute. Jean is also a popular athlete of Bayville. She wears a black costume with green accent. Since she is a telepath, she's the one who operates Cerebro aside from Professor Xavier. When humans {{found out about the}} existence of mutants, Jean was accused of using her physic/psionic abilities for things that she successfully accomplished without using her powers, such as playing basketball in school. At one point, Jean lost control of her powers which caused her to be uncontrollably read people's minds telepathically. The X-Men were having a hard time trying to help her, but luckily Rogue was present and used her own powers to drain enough of Jean's energy for Scott to prompt her to focus on Scott. Jean appears to have a fear of clowns, to which Mesmero uses this to take control <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind,</b> so she could do the villain's bidding.|$|E

25|$|In {{the series}} Astonishing X-Men, a {{flashback}} shows that Frost's {{survival of the}} destruction of Genosha was due to Cassandra Nova creating Frost's secondary mutation as part of a scheme to infiltrate the X-Men as a sleeper agent. A guilt ridden Frost creates psychic manifestations of a new Hellfire Club and proceeds to take down the X-Men one by one by showing them their deepest fears. Later on it is revealed that Frost's survivor's guilt is being exacerbated by Cassandra Nova who had placed a glimmer <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> in Frost's before being trapped in the body of Stuff, and that Nova had even tricked Frost into thinking that she had been complicit in the destruction of Genosha. Kitty with aid from Cyclops, Blindfold, Hisako Ichiki, and Frost herself eventually prevent Nova from transferring her mind into Hisako. Everyone present is then suddenly teleported onto a S.W.O.R.D. ship headed towards the Breakworld. The arc concludes with Kitty trapped in the bullet heading towards Earth and the team trying to find various ways to save the Earth and save Kitty. Frost keeps in telepathic contact with Kitty, trying to reassure her, even offering to psionically sedate her. Kitty sacrifices herself, phasing the bullet through Earth. In the aftermath, the X-Men are uncertain of Kitty's fate, believing her to either be dead or at least phased into part of the runaway bullet. Frost is devastated.|$|E

Austen used comedy to explore the individualism of women's lives and gender relations, and she appears to have used it to find the goodness in life, often fusing it with [...] "ethical sensibility", creating artistic tension. Critic Robert Polhemus writes, [...] "To appreciate the drama and achievement of Austen, we need to realize how deep was her passion for both reverence and ridicule... and her comic imagination reveals both the harmonies and the telling contradictions <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> and vision {{as she tries to}} reconcile her satirical bias with her sense of the good." ...|$|E

500|$|Church {{later said}} that the team [...] "stumbled into a nice villain" [...] with SHODAN, in that she could {{routinely}} and directly affect the player's gameplay [...] "in non-final ways". Through triggered events and through objects in the environment, such as security cameras that the player must destroy, the team made SHODAN's presence part of the player's exploration of the world. Because SHODAN interacts with the player as a [...] "recurring, consistent, palpable enemy", Church believed that she meaningfully connects the player to the story. System Shock concept artist Robb Waters created SHODAN's visual design, and LoPiccolo recruited his bandmate Terri Brosius to voice the character. Brosius said that her goal during the recording sessions was to speak [...] "without emotion, but with some up and down inflections". Afterward, her voice was heavily edited in post-production, which created a robotic effect inspired by the voice of Max Headroom. LoPiccolo later {{said that the}} large number of effects on Brosius's voice were [...] "laboriously hand-done" [...] with Sound Designer, which lacked the features that a sound editor would normally use to achieve such results. SHODAN's dialogue early in the game was given [...] "a few glitches" [...] to hint at her corrupted status. LoPiccolo increased the number of these effects throughout the game, which creates an [...] "arc" [...] that ends with SHODAN [...] "completely out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> [...] collapsing as an entity". The character of the hacker arose as a reaction against the protagonist of the Ultima series, the Avatar. According to Grossman, they wanted to cast the player as someone [...] "interestingly morally compromised" [...] who had a stake in the situation.|$|E

500|$|The British {{historian}} Tom Furniss called An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution {{the most}} neglected of Wollstonecraft's books, which {{was first published}} in London in 1794, and a second edition did not appear until 1989. The reason for this neglect is later generations were more interested in her feminist writings rather her account of the French Revolution, which Furniss regretted as he called An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution easily Wollstonecraft's [...] "best work". Wollstonecraft was not trained as a historian, but she used all sorts of journals, letters and documents recounting how ordinary people in France reacted to the Revolution, and attempted to counter-act what Furniss called the [...] "hysterical" [...] anti-revolutionary mood in Britain, which depicted the Revolution as due to the entire French nation apparently all going mad. Wollstonecraft argued that the revolution was not due to the French people all going insane in 1789 as popular opinion in Britain held, but was due to a set of social, economic and political conditions that left no other way out of the crisis that gripped France in 1789. [...] An Historical and Moral View of the French Revolution presented a difficult balancing act for Wollstonecraft as she condemned the Jacobin regime and the Reign of Terror, but at same time, she continued to argue that revolution was a great achievement, which led her to stop her history in late 1789 rather than write about the Terror of 1793–94. Burke had ended the Reflections with reference to the events of 5–6 October 1789, when a group of women from Paris forced the French royal family from the Palace of Versailles to Paris. Burke called the women [...] "furies from hell" [...] while Wollstonecraft called the women just merely ordinary housewives angry about a lack of bread to feed their families. Against Burke's idealised portrait of Marie Antoinette as a noble victim of a mob, Wollstonecraft portrayed the queen as a femme fatale, a seductive, scheming and dangerous woman. Wollstonecraft argued that the values of the aristocracy were corrupting ones for women since in a monarchy, the main purpose of a woman was to bear sons to continue the house, which essentially reduced a woman's value down to her womb. Moreover, Wollstonecraft argued unless a queen was a queen regnant, most queens were queen consorts, which meant a woman to exercise influence via her husband or son, which encouraged manipulative behavior. Wollstonecraft argued that aristocratic values by emphasising the value of a woman's body and her ability to be charming over the value <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind</b> and character had encouraged women like Marie Antoinette to be manipulative and ruthless, making the queen into a corrupted and corrupting product of the ancien régime.|$|E

2500|$|In 1636 Maria Eleonora {{was taken}} to Gripsholm castle and officially lost her parental rights to her daughter, because at times she was {{completely}} out <b>of</b> <b>her</b> <b>mind.</b> In 1639 a letter written by her and intended for Sweden's archenemy, the King Christian IV of Denmark, was intercepted. After a summons, Maria Eleonora appeared at her daughter's court in a flood of tears {{in the summer of}} 1640. Queen Christina, 13 years old, reasoned with her mother and dissuaded her from taking up residence at Nyköping near Denmark. Afterwards, Maria Eleonora returned to Gripsholm. To undertake one of her periodic fasts, she retired to the seclusion of her own apartment, accompanied by only one of her ladies-in-waiting, Anna Sofia von Bülow. Maria Eleonora wrote regularly to her daughter Christina. [...] She and her German court wanted to leave their exile at Gripsholm castle. [...] Christina replied tactfully, knowing that the Council would not permit the queen mother any leave. Eventually her mother asked to leave Sweden altogether. [...] Christina invited her to Stockholm, attempting to persuade her to stay in the country. [...] At night the two ladies let themselves down from a window and were rowed in a boat {{to the other side of}} the nearby lake, where a carriage was waiting for them. They drove to Nyköping, where they boarded a Danish ship. [...] King Christian IV had intended the ship to take her home to Brandenburg, but she convinced the captain to bring her to Denmark instead. She was well received by the Danish king, but that did not make the demanding Maria Eleonora like Denmark any better. She wanted to go home to Brandenburg.
