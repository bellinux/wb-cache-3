30|$|This {{problem has}} been tackled in various papers in the past. In all these works, the {{importance}} of implementing a fast and accurate grid voltage synchronization algorithm has been highlighted. Reference [3] presents a control method based on the adaptation of a dual second order generalized integrator based on a frequency locked loop (DSOGI-FLL). The algorithm is implemented in a grid-connected power converter that acts as an intelligent connection agent (ICA). The presence of many voltage source converters, however, may deteriorate its effectiveness. Reference [4] proposes an active synchronizing control scheme that also adopts a central based coordinated control for multiple DGs. In [5], the synchronization control system sends remote compensator signals from the substation to the speed and voltage regulators of a hydro plant, achieving safe reconnection. The phase coincidence is addressed only {{by means of a}} synchronism check relay that blocks the reconnection until the phase difference is null. This may delay the transfer for undefined period of time. Reference [6] presents a transfer strategy based <b>on</b> <b>droop</b> control of local microsources providing good results. The algorithm moves the droop equations of the microsources to achieve frequency synchronization and in later stage phase synchronization. However, the second synchronization stage affects the frequency synchronization, while the voltage magnitude coincidence is not addressed. The synchronization system presented in [7] is based on two dual second order generalized integrators (DSOGI) and two stationary reference frames phase locked loop (SRF-PLL) for synchronizing the grid voltage with the capacitor voltage of the converter filter. Besides the requirement of rather complex components, the main consideration here is that during the synchronization process, the droop control is not employed and none of its functions are carried out.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} autonomous droop-based control {{schemes to}} share power proportionally in inverter-connected islanded microgrids; in which different microgrid structures such as inductive (L-type), resistive (R-type), and resistive-inductive (RL-type) are considered. The main aim of designing new controllers in this dissertation is to distribute the load change among intermittent distributed generators according to their power ratings. A linearized model of microgrids is {{used to evaluate the}} change in powers (real-reactive) of the distributed generators due to the load change, but it is noticed that the linearized modeling of microgrids depends on the distribution line parameters. Thus, proportional power sharing cannot be maintained. Improved droop-based algorithms are developed {{to share power}} based <b>on</b> <b>droop</b> gains by including a voltage control law; in which the reference values of the generator voltages are kept the same. A compensation-based droop control is provided by adding a power offset to the real power for balancing the inverter output power during the variation in the output of distributed generation. A derivative term is also included in droop algorithms for damping the oscillatory modes of the controllers so that improved dynamic performance can be ensured. This thesis contains eigenvalue analysis to predict the stability of microgrids. However, it is anticipated that this method may not provide satisfactory results in large inverter-dominated systems as {{it is based on the}} quasi-static approximation. In order to overcome this shortcoming, an extended dynamic phasors analysis is described in this dissertation in details to find out a suitable stability range of droop gains for the proposed controllers. Finally, the performance of the designed droop-based power sharing controller is verified on a multi photovoltaic source-based islanded test microgrid and superior dynamic performance is obtained compared with the conventional RL-type droop controller...|$|E
40|$|The {{world at}} large is passing through a phase of energy {{transformation}} – from a traditional centralized unidirectional to a decentralized and distributed bidirectional power system, with consumers becoming prosumers. Facilitated by the technological advancements in power electronics and growing concerns over climatic changes, this transformation lead to increasing deployment of renewable energy sources. All these converge {{to the evolution of}} a concept – Microgrid, which empowers Smart Grid of the Future. In the thesis, the concept of Cell, a microgrid comprising of Distributed renewable energy sources like solar, wind etc., Battery energy storage systems and Controllable loads is conceived. Devoid of use of any communication equipment, the Cell relies on measurements of local variables for evaluating the State of Energy and Power. The primary focus is on the formulation of control strategy based <b>on</b> <b>droop</b> control that enables a seamless (dis) connection of Cell with External Grid, with still maintaining the operation of converter in voltage source mode. This control scheme is further extended for connection and disconnection of multiple Cells interconnected through a Backbone bus, referred to as Interconnected mode. Adding to this, a decision-making algorithm is developed for an autonomous operation of Cells, that determines the switching instants between Stand-alone and Interconnected modes. The developed control strategy and automated decision-making algorithm was simulated in DIgSILENT PowerFactory software for varied scenarios to evaluate the performance and the overall stability of the system. The simulations show a seamless transition between different operating modes – Stand-alone, Interconnected and Grid-connected and the automated decision-making algorithm succeeded in achieving overall stability, increasing the reliability of power to end consumers. Experiments were performed on a standard converter to prove the practical implementation capability of the developed control scheme as an intermediate interface. The modular and distributed nature of the developed controls and algorithm, makes it's advantageous to apply such Cells to electrify remote areas, which have limited or no access to power. The system can be easily scaled and expanded by adding more Cells, to build a strong and robust microgrid network. CSGRiPSustainable Energy Technolog...|$|E
