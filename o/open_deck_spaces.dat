5000|$|MV Hebrides {{design is}} very similar to that of her half-sister, [...] of 1998. There is an {{increased}} amount of <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> <b>space,</b> the majority of it being covered. She was the first vessel of the fleet to be equipped with a Marine Evacuation System of inflatable chutes leading to large liferafts in place of conventional lifeboats. Following simulations and the success of the Clansman’s design, her hull incorporates fewer gaps for water to escape from the car deck.|$|R

5000|$|Plans {{called for}} {{accommodations}} for 1,900 passengers which included 950 cabins, 77 {{percent of which}} were to be [...] "outside cabins," [...] and 64 percent of which were to have private balconies. The ships were to have 85850 sq ft of <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> <b>space,</b> extensive health spa and gymnasium facilities, and 2100 sq ft of conference space. In addition, the upper three decks of the ships were to be designed to [...] "maximize the sense of spaciousness on board, and provide passengers with panoramic views of the Hawaiian Islands and the surrounding Pacific Ocean".|$|R
50|$|Above the {{car deck}} are {{two levels of}} accommodation, {{providing}} shelter and facilities for up to 1000 passengers. The first deck houses the cafeteria at the bow, with the main entrance concourse and shop immediately aft. Behind this are lounges, toilets and the information desk, with {{the bar at the}} stern. The next deck has an observation lounge at the stern and crew accommodation further forward. External <b>deck</b> <b>space</b> stretches from the lounge to just short of the bridge on both sides. An observation lounge on the top deck has seating aft of the funnel. The large amount of <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> <b>space</b> is one factor that makes the Isle of Mull popular with tourists.|$|R

This was supplemented by the addition of a smoking room for men and a General Room on C Deck which women could use for reading and writing. Although they were not as glamorous in design as spaces seen in upper class accommodations, they were still far above average for the period.|$|R
50|$|Although Raffaello was {{the larger}} of the two ships, and its {{interiors}} more distinctive, it was always the less important ship in the eyes of Italian Line executives. As a result, when the transatlantic traffic started declining due to competition from air traffic, the Raffaello was sent cruising in order to make more money while the Michelangelo was used strictly for crossings. The Raffaello was not very well suited for cruising. Although it did have a large amount of <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> <b>space,</b> the ship was too large, its cabins too small, and most of them too spartan for demanding cruise passengers.|$|R

50|$|Noted {{as being}} the prime {{breadwinner}} for trans-Atlantic shipping lines, third class aboard Lusitania was praised for the improvement in travel conditions it provided to emigrant passengers, and Lusitania {{proved to be a}} quite popular ship for immigrants. In the days before Lusitania and even still during the years in which Lusitania was in service, third class accommodation consisted of large open spaces where hundreds of people would share open berths and hastily constructed public spaces, often consisting of no more than a small portion of <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> <b>space</b> and a few tables constructed within their sleeping quarters. However, in an attempt to break that mould, the Cunard Line began designing ships such as Lusitania with more comfortable third class accommodation.|$|R
50|$|The main {{staircase}} is in {{the center}} of the main deck, leading upward to the upper decks. A second stair underneath leads down to the crew spaces in the hull. On either side of the main stair are gangplank openings for loading passengers. Forward of the stair is a large <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> <b>space.</b> Aft of the stair, a passageway runs across the vessel, aft of which is the stack casing and a well opening down into the engine room, where the main engine can be seen by passengers on the main deck.

5000|$|MV Iona was {{ten feet}} longer than , and of greater draft, but twin rudders gave her greater {{manoeuvrability}} than the earlier MacBrayne ferries. She was the companys first vessel without traditional teak decking. Her vehicle facilities impressed, but passenger accommodation compared poorly with the 1964 ships. She {{had very little}} <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> <b>space</b> for passengers. Forward on the boat deck (B Deck), there was a full-width lounge for 101 passengers with seating upholstered in blue until they were recovered with sick coloured vinyl in 1984. High bows obstructed the forward view for seated passengers. Aft of this, a deckhouse held a cafeteria. On the lower deck (E Deck), below the car deck were a smoke-room/bar (no longer used) and crew quarters. Unusually for a large MacBrayne ship, Iona had no sleeping accommodation for passengers.|$|R
50|$|At 10:15 PM, {{three minutes}} after impact, the ship listed by five degrees to starboard. By 10:25 PM, the list {{increased}} to fourteen degrees and the six-meter gash received {{water from the}} sea. By 10:29, the ship listed by twenty-three degrees; this prevented the launching of additional lifeboats. Three of the eight lifeboats were launched. At 10:32, the ship listed by 33 degrees. By 10:50, the ship lay on its side. Since {{the clock on the}} bridge stopped at 11:02, authorities knew that the ship sank at that time. The degree of damage, the scenario, and the <b>open</b> vehicle <b>deck</b> <b>space</b> in RORO ferry design led to the sinking.|$|R
2500|$|Because it sailed the {{southern}} Atlantic routes, Andrea Doria {{was the first}} ship to feature three outdoor swimming pools, one for each class (first, cabin, and tourist). When fully booked, the ship was capable of accommodating 1,241 passengers in three different classes; 218 in first class, 320 in cabin class, and 703 in tourist class. As was the rule aboard Trans-Atlantic passenger liners, each passenger class was strictly segregated to specific parts of the ship. First class accommodations were located amidships on the upper decks, cabin class accommodations were located just aft of first class, and tourist-class accommodations were divided between the forward- and after-most ends {{of the ship and}} were connected by corridors which ran the full length of the ship. Each class had its own separate dining room, lounges, and social halls, designated areas of <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> <b>space</b> and enclosed promenades, and even their own swimming pools with verandas. In addition, 563 crew members were charged with operating and maintaining the ship. Over US$1 million was spent on artwork and the decor of the cabins and public rooms, including a life-sized statue of Admiral Doria, and many consider the ship to {{have been one of the}} most beautiful ocean liners ever built next to Cunard's two Queens, , , and the French Line's [...]|$|R
50|$|Her {{appearance}} was strange in 1957, with forward superstructure and an <b>open</b> main <b>deck</b> at the stern with a 7-ton crane behind the hoist and side-ramps. The lift {{was required to}} get vehicles to the car deck. Below the car deck were a bar and crew cabins. On her upper deck were a combined tea-room and bar aft, seating sixty, with a lounge for 218, forward. The entrance hall, between lounge and tea-room, had the Caley lion emblazoned on the linoleum. There was <b>open</b> and semi-enclosed <b>deck</b> <b>space</b> on this upper deck and on the promenade deck, {{with an abundance of}} wooden sparred seats. The superstructure was topped by a tripod mainmast and a handsome, modern funnel.|$|R
50|$|Why {{do we need}} Marine Chemist? Lets take {{a moment}} to examine that question. Basic ship design... <b>open</b> <b>decks</b> and {{enclosed}} <b>spaces</b> for cargoes... has remained basically unchanged for decades. Structural materials and methods have changed, but in principle, the basic design concept has been the same for centuries. Today's cargoes, however, have shifted to a greater number of toxic substances. That has added the health concern of toxicity to the existing safety concerns of fire and explosion, not just during a voyage, but even when a vessel is in a shipyard for routine maintenance and repair.|$|R
5000|$|The {{reasons are}} best {{explained}} in a secret investigation conducted by the U.S. Immigration Bureau. During the years when immigration to the United States was at its peak, American agent Anna Herkner disguised herself as a Bohemian immigrant and made three trans-Atlantic crossings on ships of three different lines to carry out {{an investigation of the}} conditions of steerage in secret. Although the actual report omits the names of the vessels she travelled on, records at Ellis Island reveal which ships she had included in her study: in 1905, she made a westbound crossing in steerage aboard the North German Lloyd line's Friedrich Der Grosse, followed in 1907 by the Hamburg Amerika Line's Pennsylvania, and finally, in 1909, she sailed aboard the White Star Line's Cedric. Her report contrast [...] "old-type" [...] and [...] "new-type steerage", recommending that the government should bring about transition to the latter. While aboard Friedrich Der Grosse and the Pennsylvania she witnessed stewards sexually assaulting female steerage passengers, a severe lack of medical care, and scarcely tolerable food provided to steerage passengers. Aboard Cedric, however, Herkner was surprised at how well she was treated and how well passengers were provided for. In her report, she described her cabin, which she shared with three other women, as private, comfortable, and clean. She noted that each cabin had a bell by which a steward could be summoned, features such as mirrors, hooks to hang clothing on, and private wash basins. The food was of better quality, and the <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> <b>space</b> allotted to steerage passengers was far greater than in the [...] "old-type" [...] steerage on the other two ships.|$|R
50|$|In past years, {{a number}} of {{expedition}} vessels have been engaged for SOI Antarctic expeditions. They include MV Polar Star, which has been converted for expedition cruising, and the MV Akademik Shokalskiy. The SOI’s southern expeditions have been conducted on the research vessel, the MV Ushuaia, built in 1970 for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). She has served for the NOAA under the names Researcher and Malcolm Baldrige. The ship can carry approximately 84 passengers and staff and has more than 40 cabins {{as well as an}} <b>open</b> bridge policy, <b>deck</b> <b>space,</b> dedicated research areas and public areas including a dining room, an observation lounge, a conference room with modern multimedia equipment and a well-stocked library.|$|R
5000|$|On 29 April 1974, {{still without}} a {{permanent}} role, she {{started a new}} fast [...] "Marine Motorway" [...] from Oban to Castlebay and Lochboisdale, inaugurating a Lochboisdale linkspan that July and berthing there overnight. Iona included Coll and Tiree only in her winter roster, which also included a non-landing call at Tobermory. She still used her lift at Barra, Coll and Tiree. Even without Coll and Tiree, the sail from Oban to Barra and South Uist was still a long one and, with very early morning departures. Ionas lack of sleeping berths was greatly criticised. In her 1975 refit, a new deckhouse was added, aft of the officers accommodation and incorporating eight double cabins. MV Iona completed five seasons on the Oban - Castlebay / Lochboisdale service, but proved increasingly too small, especially with the heavy year-round army traffic to Uist bases via Lochboisdale. The arrival of the new [...] at Oban and the purchase of Western Ferries Kennacraig facilities in October, finally allowed Iona {{to take up the}} Islay service on 15 February 1979. At first she gave three return runs daily between Kennacraig and Port Ellen, with two on Sundays. From 24 October 1979, she gave two calls weekly at the newly extended Port Askaig pier. After Western Ferries finally abandoned their Islay service at the end of September 1981, Cal-Mac offered more calls to Port Askaig. Each winter Iona returned to Oban, relieving Claymore and usually had her own refit in February or March, sometimes at Govan, but more usually in Greenock. Losing her crane in 1983 and a Perspex canopy on her limited <b>open</b> <b>deck</b> <b>space,</b> she was extensively refurbished in 1984. She continued to be bothered with mechanical trouble, usually her gearboxes. [...] In May 1989, Iona was once again displaced by Claymore, cascading to the Islay station on the commissioning of [...] Iona took over the Mallaig - Armadale service. For the first time in sixteen years, she was again on a purely hoist-loading route, until she opened linkspans at Mallaig and Armadale on 1 April 1994. She was a great success at Armadale seeing an increase in traffic, and offering a varying routine of weekend sailings from Mallaig to Castlebay, Lochboisdale. In winter she relieved widely throughout the fleet.|$|R

The upper passenger deck consisted of a small coffee cabin and games machines, with stairs leading down to the lower deck. The lower deck lounge had a ticket office (which closed following new regulations in 2005) and toilets aft, with doorways leading to the car deck. Juno had her accommodation renovated in 1993.
