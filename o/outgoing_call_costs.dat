30|$|We {{consider}} {{the arrival of}} both incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls.</b> The call arrival rate refers to {{the total number of}} incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> during busy hour conditions. The call arrival process follows Poisson distribution. For high mobility users, the rate of incoming calls is assumed to be higher than the corresponding <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls.</b>|$|R

Numbers registered under the GTPS will {{still be able to}} make <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> if the service is limited. All telephones will still be able to receive calls.|$|R

50|$|The {{similarly}} named Government Telephone Preference Scheme {{is quite}} different; it {{is a system}} used since 1952 by the General Post Office and its successor British Telecom for disabling <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> from all landlines if the telephone network is overloaded during an emergency; only vital lines which are registered with the scheme may make <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> when it is activated.|$|R

5000|$|Automatic number {{announcement}} {{systems are}} based on automatic number identification, and meant for phone company technicians, the ANAC system works with unlisted numbers, numbers with caller ID blocking, and numbers with no <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> allowed. Installers of multi-line business services where <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> from all lines display the company's main number on call display can use ANAC to identify a specific line in the system, even if CID displays every line as [...] "line one".|$|R
5000|$|In the United States and Canada, callers pay {{the cost}} of {{connecting}} to the Gateway MSC of the subscriber's phone company, regardless of the actual location of the phone. As mobile numbers are given standard geographic numbers according to the North American Numbering Plan, callers pay the same to reach fixed phones and mobile phones in a given geographic area. Mobile subscribers pay for the connection time (typically using in-plan or prepaid minutes) for both incoming and <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls.</b> For <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls,</b> any long distance charges are billed as if they originate at the GMSC, {{even though it is}} the visiting MSC that completes the connection to the PSTN. Plans that include nationwide long distance and/or nationwide roaming at no additional charge over [...] "local" [...] <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> are popular.|$|R

50|$|The Whoscall ShowCard was {{released}} as Beta in v4.3. It {{allows users to}} customize their <b>outgoing</b> <b>call</b> screens. Users can edit their personal or business names, along with descriptions such as business address, business hours or photos to {{be shown to be}} shown as his or her ShowCard. This info will be shown in all <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> as it rings on screen of the receiving end. When the call ends, the receiver, through the call end dialogue, may also choose to view more information regarding the number.|$|R
50|$|The {{corresponding}} {{service to}} DID for <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> from a PBX {{to the central}} office exchange is called direct outward dialing (DOD) or Direct Dial Central Office (DDCO). This service is often combined with DID service and allows direct dialing of global telephone numbers by every extension covered by the service without the assistance of an operator. The caller line identification (CLI) or caller-id of extensions for <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> is often set to the extension DID number, but may be the organization's central switch board number.|$|R

40|$|Description FuncMap {{analyzes}} the function calls in an R package {{and creates a}} hive plot of the calls, dividing them among functions that only make <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> (sources), functions that have only incoming calls (sinks), and those that have both incoming <b>calls</b> and make <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> (managers). Function calls can be mapped by their absolute numbers, their normalized absolute numbers, or their rank. FuncMap should be useful for comparing packages {{at a high level}} for their overall design. Plus, it's just plain fun. The hive plot concept was developed by Martin Krzywinski (www. hiveplot. com) and inspired this package...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} single server Markovian retrial queues with mul-tiple {{types of}} <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls.</b> Incoming calls {{arrive at the}} server according to a Poisson process. The service time of an incoming call follows the exponential distribution. In-coming calls that nd the server busy upon arrival join an orbit and retry after some exponentially distributed time. On the other hand, the server makes an <b>outgoing</b> <b>call</b> after some exponentially distributed idle time. We assume that there are multiple types of <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> whose durations follow the exponential distribution with dierent parame-ters. For this model, we obtain explicit expressions for the joint stationary distribution {{of the number of}} calls in the or-bit and the state of the server using the generating function approach. We also obtain simple asymptotic and recursive formulae for the joint stationary distribution. We show a stochastic decomposition property where we prove that the total number of incoming calls in the system (server and orbit) can be expressed by the sum of three independent random variables which have a clear physical meaning. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} an M/G/ 1 retrial queueing system with {{two types of}} calls which models a telephone switching system. In the case that arriving calls are blocked due to the channel being busy, the <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> are queued in priority group whereas the incoming calls enter the retrial group {{in order to try}} service again after a random amount of time. In this paper we find the Laplace-Stieltjes transform of the distribution of the virtual waiting time for an incoming call. When the arrival rate of <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> is zero, it is shown that our result is consistent with the known result for a retrial queueing system with one type of call. Key words: Retrial queues, process, Laplace-Stieltjes transform...|$|R
50|$|In most mid-20th-century {{switching}} equipment, {{a permanent}} signal would tie up a junctor circuit, diminishing {{the ability of}} the switch to handle <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls.</b> When flooded cables or other conditions made this a real problem, switch staff would open the cable, or paper the off-normal contacts of the crossbar switch, or block the line relay from operating. These methods had the disadvantage of blocking all <b>outgoing</b> <b>calls</b> from that line until it was manually cleared. Manufacturers also sold devices that monitored the talk wires and held up the cutoff relay or crossbar hold magnet until the condition cleared. Some crossbar line circuit designs had a park condition allowing the line circuit itself to monitor the line.|$|R
