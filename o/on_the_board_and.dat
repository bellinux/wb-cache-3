The relative wealth of the various places has changed slightly. Whitechapel Road is now the cheapest (as opposed to Old Kent Road) but Mayfair remains the most expensive; in 2016 an estimate by loan provider West One showed the average house price on each was £590,000 and £3,150,000 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The tablebase {{contains}} the game-theoretical value (win, loss, or draw) of each possible move in each possible position, {{and how many}} moves {{it would take to}} achieve that result with perfect play. Thus, the tablebase acts as an oracle, always providing the optimal moves. Typically the database records each possible position with certain pieces remaining <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>board,</b> <b>and</b> the best moves with White to move and with Black to move.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Booker and tech {{executives}} Sarah Ross and Nathan Richardson formed Waywire, {{a company}} focused on video sharing technology. Early investors included Oprah Winfrey, Eric Schmidt, Jeff Weiner, and Troy Carter. After Booker's relationship to Waywire was discussed in a front-page New York Times story, board member Andrew Zucker {{stepped down from}} his position. Shortly thereafter, Waywire CEO Nathan Richardson departed the business as the company shifted its focus from content creation to content curation. In August 2013, Booker told NBC News he intended to resign from the Waywire board and put his holdings in a trust if elected to the Senate; by September, he had resigned his place <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>and</b> donated {{his share of the}} company to charity. Waywire was sold to another video curation business the following month.|$|E

5|$|By mid February 2001, York were {{bottom of}} the Third Division table, but after losing only two of their last 16 matches they {{finished}} 2000–01 in 17th. They reached the FA Cup third round {{for the second time}} since 1986, but were beaten 3–0 by Premier League team Leicester City at Filbert Street. Record losses of £1,261,038 were reported in November 2001, before Craig announced in December that the club and the ground had been put up for sale for £4.5million. Craig later said Bootham Crescent would close by June 2002, and the club would resign from the Football League if a buyer was not found. The club was taken over by motor racing driver John Batchelor in March 2002. He pledged to give the Supporters' Trust (ST) two seats <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>and</b> announced a sponsorship deal with Persimmon that would see an undisclosed amount split between the club and his racing team. By late March 2002, York were second from bottom, before a run of five wins from the last eight matches saw them finish 2001–02 in 14th place. They reached the FA Cup fourth round {{for the first time since}} 1986, losing 2–0 at home to Premier League team Fulham.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{become more}} complex as the player progresses, {{introducing}} different mechanics and {{new types of}} enemies. Each enemy type {{is dressed in a}} unique colour, allowing the player to recognise their movement patterns. Some enemies remain static or rotate on a single node, while others will patrol the board along a specific route. Later stages may require the player to collect keys located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>and</b> unlock doors that block access to the level objective. Trapdoors connect one location on the board to another and allow the player to move between them during a turn. Some nodes contain potted plants, the player will not be detected while occupying these nodes. Coloured disguises can be found and equipped to let the player walk past an enemy type of that colour without being detected. There are throwable objects that are used to disrupt and change enemy behaviour patterns. Firearms can also be found on certain levels, they are used to shoot targets or obstacles from a distance.|$|E
5|$|In 1809, Napoleon I of France {{arrived at}} Schönbrunn Palace {{to play the}} Turk. According to an {{eyewitness}} report, Mälzel took responsibility {{for the construction of}} the machine while preparing the game, and the Turk (Johann Baptist Allgaier) saluted Napoleon {{before the start of the}} match. The details of the match have been published over the years in numerous accounts, many of them contradictory. According to Bradley Ewart, it is believed that the Turk sat at its cabinet, and Napoleon sat at a separate chess table. Napoleon's table was in a roped-off area and he was not allowed to cross into the Turk's area, with Mälzel crossing back and forth to make each player's move and allowing a clear view for the spectators. In a surprise move, Napoleon took the first turn instead of allowing the Turk to make the first move, as was usual; but Mälzel allowed the game to continue. Shortly thereafter, Napoleon attempted an illegal move. Upon noticing the move, the Turk returned the piece to its original spot and continued the game. Napoleon attempted the illegal move a second time, and the Turk responded by removing the piece from the board entirely and taking its turn. Napoleon then attempted the move a third time, the Turk responding with a sweep of its arm, knocking all the pieces off the board. Napoleon was reportedly amused, and then played a real game with the machine, completing nineteen moves before tipping over his king in surrender. Alternate versions of the story include Napoleon being unhappy about losing to the machine, playing the machine at a later time, playing one match with a magnet <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>board,</b> <b>and</b> playing a match with a shawl around the head and body of the Turk in an attempt to obscure its vision.|$|E

25|$|Waterstarting {{is faster}} and less tiring {{compared}} to climbing back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>board</b> <b>and</b> uphauling the sail, but requires enough wind (about 14 knots or more, {{depending on the}} skills, weight and agility of the surfer) to perform.
