40|$|The {{rise of the}} {{internet}} {{is often associated with}} the “death of distance” or at least the decreasing relevance of geographical distance in the supply of information. We investigate whether distance still matters for <b>online</b> <b>trade</b> in physical goods. We use a unique dataset on <b>online</b> cross-border <b>trade</b> in goods in a linguistically fragmented EU market. The analysis confirms that distance-related trade costs are greatly reduced compared to offline trade in the same goods. However, language-related trade costs increase. Moreover, <b>online</b> <b>trade</b> introduces new sources of trade costs such as parcel delivery and online payments systems. On balance, there are no indications that <b>online</b> <b>trade</b> is less biased in favour of home market products than offline trade. We examine options available to policy makers to boost cross-border e-commerce in the EU Digital Single Market. A 1 % increase in the use of efficient and flexible cross-border payment systems could increase cross-border e-commerce by as much as 7 %. We also show that <b>online</b> <b>trade</b> gives a comparative advantage to English-language exporting countries. JRC. J. 3 -Information Societ...|$|R

40|$|There are no {{official}} statistics on international <b>online</b> <b>trade</b> in goods so far. This paper uses a consumer survey {{to construct a}} unique matrix of online B 2 C domestic and cross-border trade in goods between the 27 EU Member States. We compare <b>online</b> and offline <b>trade</b> patterns for similar goods. We find that the standard gravity model performs well in explaining <b>online</b> cross-border <b>trade</b> flows. The model confirms the strong reduction in geographical distance-related trade costs, compared to offline trade. However, the trade costs associated with crossing language barriers increase when moving from offline to <b>online</b> <b>trade.</b> Institutional variables such as online payments facilities and cost-efficiency of parcel delivery systems might {{play a significant role}} in cross-border trade and our analysis confirms this. In a linguistically segmented market like the EU, online home market bias remains high compared to bias in offline cross-border trade. We conclude that it is hard to predict at this stage whether regulators could boost <b>online</b> cross-border <b>trade</b> through improvements in legal and financial systems, and parcel delivery infrastructure.
