40|$|In {{optimal control}} of robots, the {{standard}} procedure {{is to determine}} first off-line an optimal open-loop control, using some nominal or estimated values of the model parameters, and to correct then the resulting deviation of the effective trajectory or performance of the system from the prescribed trajectory, from the prescribed performance values, resp., by <b>on-line</b> <b>measurement</b> and control actions. However, <b>on-line</b> <b>measurement</b> and control actions are expensive in general and very time-consuming, moreover, they are suitable only for rather small deviations. By adaptive optimal stochastic trajectory planning and control (AOSTPC), i. e., incorporating sequentially the available a priori and measurement information about the unknown model parameters into the optimal control design process by using stochastic optimization methods, the (conditional) mean absolute deviation between the actual and prescribed trajectory, performance, resp., can be reduced considerably, hence, more robust controls are obtained. The corresponding feedforward and feedback (PD-) controls are derived by means of sequential stochastic optimization and by using stability requirements. In addition, methods for the numerical computation of the controls in real-time are presented. Moreover, analytical estimates are given for {{the reduction of the}} tracking error, hence, for the reduction of the <b>on-line</b> <b>measurement</b> and correction expenses by applying (AOSTPC) ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In a {{continuous}} chemical process, the {{accuracy and reliability}} of process and analytical measurements creates the basis for control system performance and ultimately for product uniformity. Measurement results, whether from fast <b>on-line</b> <b>measurement</b> devices or from sample-based laboratory analyses, is the key for selecting the method for process control and analysis. Intelligent and advanced control methods, exploiting measurements, are of no benefit, if the measurements cannot be trusted. This report presents results from project where target was to develop validation and estimation method for combining real-time redundant signals, consisting of sensor data, and analytical measurements. The validation of <b>on-line</b> <b>measurement</b> uses less frequently updated but more accurate information to validate frequently updated but less accurate on-line measurements. Validation and estimation of measurements are the keys and prerequisites to efficient calibration of <b>on-line</b> <b>measurement</b> device. An estimate of the measured variable is obtained as a weighted average of the on-line measurements and laboratory analyses. The weighting coefficients are recursively updated in real time when new analyse and measurement results are available. The uncertainty of laboratory analysis must be below a specific limit, or the basic assumption of laboratory analyse being reliable and used as reference to <b>on-line</b> <b>measurement</b> device can not be used. The calibration and estimation filter has been tested by several data sets collected from an operating plant. The calculation of optimal estimate {{can be used in}} several industrial applications to produce additional information for more precise process control. In addition, pre-processed data can be used to calculate a "need for maintenance indicator" to warn the operator for sensor breakdowns, wearing or deterioration and detect calibration needs. The operator's workload is thereby reduced especially in problematic situations where measurement and validation signals are not in convergent, by offering calculated best estimation...|$|E

A first approach exploits the availability of <b>on-line</b> <b>measurements</b> of both the substrate and biomass concentration. A second approach is merely based on <b>on-line</b> <b>measurements</b> of the biomass concentration, which provide an estimate for the specific growth rate.

Plug flow biofilm reactors were colonised by microorganisms indigenous to streamwater and lakewater. Seven different kinds of experiments have been performed, namely experiments with sand-filtered raw water to test the columns, long-term experiments with glucose solution, concentration experiments with glucose solution, hydrodynamic experiments with methylene blue and three different kinds of recirculation experiments with glucose solution. The hydrodynamic experiments demonstrated a retention time of 50 hours or longer for organic molecules in the size range of 200 - 300 A. This fact proves that the continuous plug flow bioreactor in the case of BDOC <b>on-line</b> <b>measurements</b> only measures an average effect and provides doubtful values for BDOC. Optimisation of retention time by optimising the pore size considering the surface area has been proposed to develop the method. A semi-batch and a trickling bioreactor have been suggested as alternative kinds of reactors for BDOC <b>on-line</b> <b>measurements.</b> Other measurement results have been influenced by the error caused by the wrong retention time or by another error which occurred due to the leakage of organic carbon from connection tubes (Vi ton). ...|$|R
