60|$|The {{garden at}} the Vicarage formed the new scene. The time was night. We had met {{together}} in secret. We were walking slowly to and fro, {{out of sight}} of the house, now in the shadowy paths of the shrubbery, now in the lovely moonlight on the <b>open</b> <b>lawn.</b>|$|E

60|$|What {{a master}} of {{composition}} Fielding was! Upon my word, I think the Oedipus Tyrannus, the Alchemist, and Tom Jones the three most perfect plots ever planned.

60|$|They always {{passed through}} the Capitol grounds on their way down town, for it gave them a little thrill of delight to pass the clumps of trees.

60|$|Before I {{joined him}} at Burry Mills Hydro, I spent {{a night at}} Holmescroft.

60|$|Donald Bane and James Dougall, having {{finished}} their fortress in {{the centre of}} the <b>open</b> <b>lawn,</b> as already described, returned to their fire, which, it may be remembered, was kindled close {{to the edge of the}} bushes.

60|$|Thus conversing, {{they passed}} through the burial-ground, and {{approached}} some high, broad walls, forming a terrace, and planted with young sycamore-trees.

Through these a winding walk led for some way, and then conducted them to an <b>open</b> <b>lawn,</b> on which was situate a vast and irregular building. As they approached the pile, a young man of very imperious aspect rushed forward from a gate, and abruptly accosted Iskander.|$|E
60|$|The day was waning now. The fog hung {{heavy on}} the treetops, and dripped upon their heads. The horses were getting tired, and slipped and {{stumbled}} in the deep clay paths.

The horse-tracks led over an <b>open</b> <b>lawn</b> of grass and fern, with here and there an ancient thorn, and round it on three sides thick wood of oak and beech, with under copse of holly and hazel. Into that wood the horse-tracks led, by a path on which there was but room for one horse at a time.|$|E
