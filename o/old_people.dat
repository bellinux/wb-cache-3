As hypoglycemia occurs in approximately 10% of infants and young children, measuring serum glucose in this population is recommended.

Thirty <b>older</b> <b>people</b> took part in initial pilot work and a further 50 were involved in reliability testing. Results: A 27 -item attitudes of <b>older</b> <b>people</b> to end-of-life issues (AEOLI) questionnaire.

In the meantime, Suddhodana attempted to foil Koṇḍañña's prediction because he wanted his son to succeed him in ruling and expanding the kingdom. Suddhodana made intricate arrangements to shield Siddhartha from all worldly suffering in order to steer his mind away from spiritual matters, pampering him with all the material luxury and sense pleasures that he could find. However, Siddhartha finally persuaded his father to allow him out of the palace to meet his subjects.

Despite this, Siddhartha saw the four sights which prompted him to reevaluate his view of the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of specific Final Fantasy characters {{was based on}} the opinions of both fans and staff. Another criterion for inclusion was whether the staff felt the characters would fit into the storyline and in the Kingdom Hearts universe. Initially, Nomura was hesitant to use characters he did not design, because he was unfamiliar with the backstory of such characters. For Kingdom Hearts II, he changed his mind after receiving pressure from his staff. Throughout the development of the games, Nomura has often left certain events and connections between characters unexplained until the release of future games. Nomura does this because he feels that games should have room for fans to speculate and use their imagination. He has stated that with speculation, even though a game gets <b>old,</b> <b>people</b> can still be happy with it.|$|E

An air defense general headquarters was established in November and a program of demolishing large numbers of buildings in major cities to create firebreaks began the next month. By {{the end of the}} war 614,000 housing units had been destroyed to clear firebreaks; these accounted for a fifth of all housing losses in Japan during the war and displaced 3.5 million people. The government also encouraged <b>old</b> <b>people,</b> children and women in cities that were believed likely to be attacked to move to the countryside from December 1943, and a program of evacuating entire classes of schoolchildren was implemented. By August 1944, 330,000 schoolchildren had been evacuated in school groups and another 459,000 had moved to the countryside with their family. Little was done to disperse industrial facilities to make them less vulnerable to attack, however, as this was logistically difficult.|$|E
5|$|The opening segment, {{reminiscent}} of a traditional British 1950s working class street of terraced houses, was filmed at Carnew Street in Dublin, and features scenes of {{each member of the}} group knocking on different doors. Then during the first chorus, the group performs a hand-action dance, that was also used during their live performances. The second half of the video, set {{in the small town of}} Rathdrum, County Wicklow. showed the group interacting with young girls in various activities, such as running around the streets dancing, skipping rope, playing hopscotch, cat's cradle and pat-a-cake, hula hooping, Geri horseback riding, and participating in competitions of various kinds. The locals are depicted as working-class people who attend the local fair or have a drink in the pub. At the end of the video, the group performs at a stage in the local hall in front of an audience of young and <b>old</b> <b>people.</b> The audience applauds after the song is finished.

5|$|In late 1942, the Germans {{consolidated}} {{some small}} ghettos in the Vilnius region with Gens' help. These included the ghettos at Oszmiana, Švenčionys, Soly, and Michaliszki. During {{one of these}} consolidations, on 25 October, Gens gave up 400 <b>old</b> <b>people</b> in return for saving the remaining 600 Jewish residents of Oszmiana. He bribed Martin Weiss, commander of the Ponary killing squad, to accept the lower quota. The Jewish police from Vilnius {{as well as some}} Lithuanians were forced to kill the 400 Jews. One ghetto diarist claimed that the Vilnius ghetto was outraged by Gens' participation in the killings, but other diarists stated that most ghetto inhabitants approved of Gens' choice to save some. By April 1943, most of these small ghettos were gone, with their inhabitants either moved to labor camps, shot, or moved to the Vilnius Ghetto. On 4–5 April, the last inhabitants were loaded into trains {{under the supervision of the}} Vilnius Jewish police, and the police accompanied the trains, which passed through Vilnius on their way to Ponary. Gens joined his policemen when the train went through Vilnius, and was arrested along with them when the train arrived at Ponary. Gens and the policemen were released, but the other Jews on the train were executed. It appears that the Germans misled Gens about the destination of the trains. Gens justified the participation of the Vilnius ghetto police in these roundups by claiming that their participation saved at least some of the ghetto residents, when otherwise the Germans would have shot them all.|$|E

In the current study, we investigate {{the extent to which}} national variation in perceptions of <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> competence is systematically related to national variation in the extent to which <b>older</b> <b>people</b> participate in paid and volunteer work. METHOD: We used multilevel regression to analyze data from the European Social Survey and test the relationship between perceptions of <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> competence and <b>older</b> <b>people's</b> participation in paid and volunteer work across 28 countries. We controlled for a number of potentially confounding variables, including life expectancy as well as the gender ratio and average education of the older population in each country.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to improve primary care for community-dwelling <b>older</b> <b>people</b> in the Netherlands. First, by {{studying}} the effectiveness of multifactorial care on health and daily functioning of community-dwelling <b>older</b> <b>people,</b> second by exploring {{the value of the}} multifactorial care by investigating experiences of <b>older</b> <b>people</b> with this nurse-led multifactorial care, and third by assessing per capita healthcare costs of <b>older</b> <b>people.</b> We evaluated the effects of nurse-led multifactorial care in a cluster randomized controlled trial. 11 practices (n= 1, 209 participants) were randomized to the intervention group, 13 practices (n= 1, 074 participants) were randomized to the control group. We found no evidence that a one-year individualized multifactorial intervention program with nurse-led care coordination resulted in prevention or postponement of new disabilities in community-dwelling <b>older</b> <b>people</b> at increased risk of functional decline. One explanation might be that by conducting a comprehensive geriatric assessment many geriatric conditions were detected, yet resulted in low recognition rates of these geriatric conditions by <b>older</b> <b>people</b> themselves. Nevertheless, <b>older</b> <b>people</b> appreciated nurse-led multifactorial care, especially because of the feeling of being looked after. Hospitalization costs were the most important contributor to the overall healthcare costs of <b>older</b> <b>people.</b> Especially <b>older</b> <b>people</b> who encounter functional decline had the highest healthcare costs.
