30|$|A {{previous}} report {{looked at the}} effectiveness of downsizing chemotherapy (distinguished from neoadjuvant chemotherapy) and subsequent so-called “conversion surgery” for initially unresectable BTC [6]. We also recently reported that in 10 of 39 (25.6 %) locally advanced unresectable BTC patients, {{the size of the}} tumor was reduced by downsizing chemotherapy, and conversion surgery was successfully performed as a result. Additionally, this downsizing chemotherapy and conversion <b>surgery</b> <b>strategy</b> led to longer survival than that with chemotherapy alone (MST: 17.9  months for chemotherapy plus surgical resection vs. 12.4  months for chemotherapy alone) [7]. Although there is a certain bias in patient selection, this could represent a promising treatment for initially unresectable locally advanced BTC.|$|R

A few days earlier, he had a septic episode with blood cultures positive for Staphylococcus aureus and clinical features of infective endocarditis. In ICU, transthoracic echocardiography revealed shunting from the aortic root to the right atrium resulting in severe cardiogenic shock.

30|$|Patients were {{selected}} from an existing local database of epilepsy patients who underwent either temporal or extratemporal lobe resection from 1998 to 2014. Patients were {{included in this study}} if they (1) had undergone both ictal and interictal SPECT-imaging before surgery, (2) had a volumetric preoperative MRI, and (3) were completely seizure free in the postoperative period for at least 1  year after surgery or had less than three seizures in the postoperative period (less than 6  months after surgery) after which they were seizure free for at least 1  year [17]. In all patients, resective <b>surgery</b> <b>strategy</b> and extent of resection were determined by consensus at a patient management meeting with integration of all available clinical information and all paraclinical and technical investigations including neuropsychological evaluation, EEG, structural MRI, language or motor fMRI, FDG PET, and SISCOM.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{factors associated}} with apparent resolution and recurrence of triggering using data from providers with various treatment strategies. A retrospective review identified 878 adult patients with 1, 210 Quinnell grade 2 or 3 trigger fingers that had one or more corticosteroid injections by one of three surgeons between 2001 and 2011. Two surgeons injected dexamethasone, but one had patients return 1 month after injection and was quick to recommend <b>surgery</b> (<b>strategy</b> A) and the other had patients return 2 months after injection, offered another injection or surgery, and followed the patient's preference. One surgeon used triamcinolone, had patients return only if the injection did not work, and waited at least 3 months to offer surgery. Factors associated with apparent resolution and recurrence of triggering were sought in bivariable and multivariable statistical analysis. Triamcinolone injection was associated with more frequent apparent resolution (83 %), than dexamethasone injection (30 %). Apparent resolution of triggering was also associated with a delayed <b>surgery</b> treatment <b>strategy</b> (B and C) and the affected finger (long and ring fingers {{were less likely to}} resolve). Return with triggering after documented or presumed resolution occurred in 188 fingers (33 %) and was associated with triamcinolone injection, index, long and ring finger, and orally treated non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Strategy A had the lowest initial apparent resolution rate, the highest proportion of patients having surgery, and the lowest final triggering rate of 10 %. Both treatment strategy and type of corticosteroid determine apparent resolution and recurrence rate...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. MaQaid (MaQ) {{is a new}} {{triamcinolone}} acetonide commercialised in Japan to visualize the vitreous. Because MaQ is preservative-free, it has a lower risk of ocular toxicities. However, since MaQ is only available as a powder, it needs suspenssion. Suspension does not always result uniformally, which causes poor visibility. This study reports a new MaQ suspension for better visibility. Methods. After medium addition to a MaQ vial, various methods were used. These included the use of (1) vortex mixer, (2) two syringes and a three-way stopcock, and (3) ultrasonic washer. We calculated suspended MaQ concentration (). To evaluate the reproducibility, we estimated the coefficient of variance (CV,). We used this MaQ for pig eyes, and vitreous visualization was simulated. Subsequently, we used this MaQ suspension for humans. Results. MaQ suspensions were sucessfull, and the concentrations of single particles increased significantly (). The CV was 36. 1 % for the routine method and 9. 03 % ffor the new method. Administration of a suspended MaQ {{made it possible to}} clearly visualize the vitreous in both pig and human eyes. Conclusions. We devised new techniques for uniformal MaQ suspension. These new methods can compensate for the MaQ disadvantages and ensure a <b>safety</b> <b>surgery...</b>|$|R

40|$|Full list {{of author}} {{information}} {{is available at the}} end of the articleBackground Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide [1]. Metastasis is the major cause of CRC mortality, and surgery is the only feasible therapy with very low mortality. However, only 10 - 20 % of CRC patients with liver metastasis are candidates for surgery [2]. Consequently, gene therapy is viewed as a promising treat-ment strategy that can complement the use of existing chemotherapy, radiation therapy and <b>surgery</b> <b>strategies</b> in these patients [3]. Chemokines are a family of small cytokines that func-tion as chemoattractants for several immune effector cell types [4]. Recent studies demonstrated that various che-mokines have the potential to suppress tumor growth and metastasis [4, 5]. One unique membrane-bound chemo-kine is chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 16 (CXCL 16), which exists as a transmembrane form (TM-CXCL 16) as well as a soluble form (sCXCL 16) that is cleaved by proteolytic enzymes [6 - 11]. TM-CXCL 16 can function as a cell adhesion molecule for its receptor cells tha...|$|R
40|$|Sequence-specific endonucleases {{recognizing}} long target sequences {{are emerging}} as powerful tools for genome engineering. These endonucleases {{could be used}} to correct deleterious mutations or to inactivate viruses, in a new approach to molecular medicine. However, such applications are highly demanding in terms of safety. Mutations in the human RAG 1 gene cause severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Using the I-CreI dimeric LAGLIDADG meganuclease as a scaffold, we describe here the engineering of a series of endonucleases cleaving the human RAG 1 gene, including obligate heterodimers and single-chain molecules. We show that a novel single-chain design, in which two different monomers are linked to form a single molecule, can induce high levels of recombination while safeguarding more effectively against potential genotoxicity. We provide here the first demonstration that an engineered meganuclease can induce targeted recombination at an endogenous locus in up to 6 % of transfected human cells.
