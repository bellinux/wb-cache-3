He has run away from his father, and trudged through the streets, alone, to rejoin his mother. The woman clasped her child in her arms and decides to live for him in the future. The mother takes her child to humble lodgings, the whereabouts of which are unknown even to her husband. There she tries to make a living for herself and him by sewing, but is unable to do so. She has given the last crust of bread to the little one, and is herself in a starving condition, when the baby boy himself comes to the rescue by starting out on a business career, selling papers in the street. In this way the wolf is kept from the door for a little while longer, and the little fellow, while applying his trade <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>corner,</b> is met and recognized by his father. With his son as his guide, the repentant husband, who now realizes his unjust action, goes to his wife, and with the baby as a mediator, the two become reconciled." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eventually, {{however, the}} massive profits of drugs proved irresistible. According to Kevin Weeks, Jimmy, Stevie and I weren't in the import {{business}} and weren't {{bringing in the}} marijuana or the cocaine. We were in the shakedown business. We didn't bring drugs in; we took money off the people who did. We never dealt with the street dealers, but rather with a dozen large-scale drug distributors all over the State who were bringing in the coke and marijuana and paying hundreds of thousands to Jimmy. The dealers <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> sold eight-balls, ...grams, and half grams to customers for their personal use. They were supplied by the mid level drug dealer who was selling them multiple ounces. In other words, the big importers {{gave it to the}} major distributors, who sold it to the middlemen, who then sold it to the street dealers. In order to get to Jimmy, Stevie, and me, someone would have had to go through those four layers of insulation.|$|E

One of Sanders' {{responsibilities}} was to gather evidence by interviewing officials and aides {{to find out more}} information about the Watergate break-in. The most famous of these interviews occurred on Friday, July 13, 1973. Alexander Butterfield (Federal Aviation Administration head and a former White House aide) was being privately questioned by Senate committee staff members, when Sanders asked if it were possible that a recording system had been used in the White House. Butterfield answered: [...] "I wish you hadn't asked that question, but, yes, there is." [...] Sanders went to relay the news to Fred Thompson, who was the Minority Counsel. Sanders first had to call him out of a local restaurant. [...] "Because he was with some reporters, I got him away from them, and got him out <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> and told him the story", Sanders said.|$|E
2500|$|For Kierkegaard, true {{individuality}} {{is called}} selfhood. Becoming {{aware of our}} true self is our true task and endeavor in life—it is an ethical imperative, as well as preparatory to a true religious understanding. Individuals can exist {{at a level that}} is less than true selfhood. We can live, for example, simply in terms of our pleasures—our immediate satisfaction of desires, propensities, or distractions. In this way, we glide through life without direction or purpose. To have a direction, we must have a purpose that defines for us the meaning of our lives. Kierkegaard puts it this way in Either/Or, Here, then, I have your view of life, and, believe me, much of your life will become clear to you if you will consider it along with me as thought-despair. You are a hater of activity in life-quite appropriately, because {{if there is to be}} meaning in it life must have continuity, and this your life does not have. You keep busy with your studies, to be sure; you are even diligent; but it is only for your sake, and it is done with as little teleology as possible. Moreover, you are unoccupied; like the laborers in the Gospel standing idle in the marketplace, you stick your hands in your pocket and contemplate life. Now you rest in despair. Nothing concerns you; you step aside for nothing; “If someone threw a roof tile down I would still not step aside.” You are like a dying person. You die daily, not in the profound, earnest sense in which one usually understands these words, but life has lost its reality and you “Always count the days of your life from one termination-notice to the next.” You let everything pass you by; nothing makes any impact. But then something suddenly comes along that grips you, an idea, a situation, a young girl’s smile, and now you are “involved,” for just on certain occasions you are not “involved,” so at other times you are “at your service” in every way. Wherever there is something going on you join in. You behave in life as you usually do in a crowd. “You work yourself into the tightest group, see to it, if possible, to get yourself shoved up over the others so that you come to be above them, and as soon as you are up there you make yourself as comfortable as possible, and in this way you let yourself be carried through life.” But when the crowd is gone, when the event is over, you again stand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>corner</b> and look at the world.

60|$|Then, for {{the first}} time, Randolph heard the grim and sordid details of John Dornton's mysterious disappearance.

The vessel itself had an evil repute, and was believed to have slipped {{from the hands of}} the police at Melbourne. John Dornton had evidently amassed a considerable fortune in Australia, although an examination of his papers and effects showed it to be in drafts and letters of credit and shares, and that he had no ready money--a fact borne out by the testimony of his shipmates. The night he arrived was spent in an orgy on board ship, which he did not leave until the early evening of the next day, although, after his erratic fashion, he had ordered a room at a hotel. That evening he took ashore a portmanteau, evidently intending to pass the night at his hotel. He was never seen again, although some of the sailors declared that they had seen him on the wharf WITHOUT THE PORTMANTEAU, and they had drunk together at a low grog shop <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>corner.</b> He had evidently fallen through some hole in the wharf. As he was seen only with the sailors, who also knew he had no ready money on his person, there was no suspicion of foul play.|$|E
