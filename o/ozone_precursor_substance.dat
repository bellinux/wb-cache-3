40|$|Abstract. The global {{three-dimensional}} Lagrangian chemistry-transport model STOCHEM {{has been}} used to follow the changes in the tropospheric distributions of the two major radiatively-active trace gases, methane and tropospheric ozone, following the emission of pulses of the short-lived tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> species, methane, carbon monoxide, NOx and hydrogen. The radiative impacts of NOx emissions were dependent on the location chosen for the emission pulse, whether at the surface or in the upper troposphere or whether in the northern or southern hemispheres. Global warming potentials were derived for each of the short-lived tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> species by integrating the methane and tropospheric ozone responses over a 100 -year time horizon. Indirect radiative forcing due to methane and tropospheric ozone changes appear to be significant for all of the tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> species studied. Whereas the radiative forcing from methane changes is likely to be dominated by methane emissions, that from tropospheric ozone changes is controlled by all the tropospheric <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> gases, particularly NOx emissions. The indirect radiative forcing impacts of tropospheric ozone changes may be large enough such that <b>ozone</b> <b>precursors</b> should be considered in the basket of trace gases through which policy-makers aim to combat global climate change. 1...|$|R

While anthropogenic emissions of <b>precursor</b> <b>substances</b> (NOx, NMVOC, CH 4) are regulated by EU air quality legislation and will decrease further in the future, the emissions of biogenic NMVOC (mainly isoprene) may increase significantly {{in the coming decades}} if short-rotation coppice plantations are expanded strongly to meet the increased biofuel demand resulting from the EU decarbonisation targets. This study investigates the competing effects of anticipated trends in land use change, anthropogenic <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> emissions and climate change on European ground level ozone concentrations and related health and environmental impacts until 2050. The work is based on a consistent set of energy consumption scenarios that underlie current EU climate and air quality policy proposals: a current legislation case, and an ambitious decarbonisation case. The Greenhouse Gas-Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) integrated assessment model was used to calculate air pollutant emissions for these scenarios, while land use change because of bioenergy demand was calculated by the Global Biosphere Model (GLOBIOM). These datasets were fed into the chemistry transport model LOTOS-EUROS to calculate the impact on ground level ozone concentrations. Health damage because of high ground level ozone concentrations is projected to decline significantly towards 2030 and 2050 under current climate conditions for both energy scenarios. Damage to plants is also expected to decrease but to a smaller extent. The projected change in anthropogenic <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> emissions is found to have a larger impact on ozone damage than land use change. The increasing effect of a warming climate (+ 2 – 5 °C across Europe in summer) on ozone concentrations and associated health damage, however, might be higher than the reduction achieved by cutting back European <b>ozone</b> <b>precursor</b> emissions. Global action to reduce air pollutant emissions is needed to make sure that ozone damage in Europe decreases towards the middle of this century. © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|R

It is natural component of the atmosphere, due to anthropogenic emissions of <b>ozone</b> <b>precursors</b> its concentration rise. That is unlikely, because ozone is toxic. Ozone is formed as a part of photochemical smog from <b>ozone</b> <b>precursors</b> by photochemical reactions. As <b>ozone</b> <b>precursors</b> nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOC) are called. Their main source is car traffic. Danger of ozone lies in its reactivity. It oxidizes most of organic compounds, especially those containing double bonds. These are present in membrane lipids. Furthermore, ozone forms more reactive compounds than itself - active oxygen species (AOS), free radicals. Ozone effects negatively both human health and vegetation. Ozone disrupts structure of the cells, which for plants means destroy of leaves and needles, photosynthesis disruption and biomass loss. For that, plants have antioxidants system for AOS scavenging. But it has little effect, when concentration of ozone is high during smog period. Therefore, limits for maximal concentration of ozone in the ambient air are set...|$|R

Based on our results, additional simulations with the NCARCAM 3. 5 model, and published studies, we estimate industrial era (1850 to 2005) whole-atmosphere ozone forcing of 0. 5 W/sq m due to anthropogenic tropospheric precursors and about - 0. 2 W/sq m due to halocarbons.

A suite of time-slice experiments show the separate, as well as pairwise, impacts of these perturbations between the years 2000 and 2100. Sensitivity to uncertainties in future greenhouse gases and aerosols is explored {{through the use of}} the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4. 5 and 8. 5 scenarios. The results highlight an important role for the stratosphere in determining the annual mean tropospheric ozone response, primarily through stratosphere-troposphere exchange of ozone (STE). Under both climate change and reductions in ODSs, increases in STE offset decreases in net chemical production and act to increase the tropospheric ozone burden. This opposesthe effects of projected decreases in <b>ozone</b> <b>precursors</b> through measures to improve air quality, which act to reduce the ozone burden.

The additivity of the changes in ozone is examined by comparing the sum of the responses in the single-forcing experiments to those from equivalent combined-forcing experiments.
