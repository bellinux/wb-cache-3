2500|$|Individuals {{affected}} by bipolar disorder exhibit deficits in strategic thinking, inhibitory control, working memory, attention, and initiation that {{are independent of}} affective state. In contrast to the more generalized cognitive impairment demonstrated in persons with schizophrenia, for example, deficits in bipolar disorder are typically less severe and more restricted. It {{has been suggested that}} a “stable dys-regulation of prefrontal function or the subcortical-frontal circuitry [...] may underlie the cognitive disturbances of bipolar disorder”. Executive dysfunction in bipolar disorder is suggested to be associated particularly with the manic state, and is largely accounted for in terms of the formal thought disorder that is a feature of mania. It is important to note, however, that patients with bipolar disorder with a history of psychosis demonstrated greater impairment <b>on</b> <b>measures</b> <b>of</b> executive functioning and spatial working memory compared with bipolar patients without a history of psychosis suggesting that psychotic symptoms are correlated with executive dysfunction.|$|E
