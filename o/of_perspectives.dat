He described how, as confirmations of interview subjects came in, he was surprised when Pat Boone {{was among the first}} to confirm his participation. Anderson had previously worked as a cameraman on a piece with Boone about eight years before starting work on Fuck. After confirming Boone, Bill Maher and Janeane Garofalo on Fuck, it became easier for Anderson to confirm other interviewees. The film included the final video interview with Hunter S. Thompson before his suicide, and Anderson dedicated it to Thompson for his contributions to journalism.|$|E

5|$|In {{the reign}} of Akhenaten (c. 1353–1336 BC) in the mid-New Kingdom, a single solar deity, the Aten, became the sole focus of the state religion. Akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased gods' names and images on monuments, {{targeting}} Amun in particular. This new religious system, sometimes called Atenism, differed dramatically from the polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods. Whereas, in earlier times, newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs, Atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional multiplicity <b>of</b> <b>perspectives.</b> Yet Atenism {{may not have been}} full monotheism, which totally excludes belief in other deities. There is evidence suggesting that the general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private. The picture is further complicated by Atenism's apparent tolerance for some other deities, like Shu. For these reasons, the Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat suggested that Akhenaten may have been monolatrous, worshipping a single deity while acknowledging the existence of others. In any case, Atenism's aberrant theology did not take root among the Egyptian populace, and Akhenaten's successors returned to traditional beliefs.|$|E

40|$|The {{positive}} effect <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> taking on favorable attitudes towards stigmatized individuals and outgroups {{is well established}} (Batson et al., 1997). We draw on the ingroup projection model (Mummendey & Wenzel, 1999) {{to better understand the}} processes underlying this effect. Based on their egocentric perspective, ingroup and outgroup members have different representations of the superordinate group (perspective divergence) so that the ingroup is perceived as more relatively prototypical of the superordinate group, leading to negative outgroup evaluation. We hypothesize that the {{positive effect}} <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> taking on outgroup attitudes is due to a reduction of relative ingroup prototypicality. Across three studies with different manipulations <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> taking, we found that participants who were taking the <b>perspective</b> <b>of</b> an outgroup member evaluated the outgroup more positively and were less inclined to perceive their ingroup as more relatively prototypical. The effect <b>of</b> <b>perspective</b> taking on outgroup attitudes was mediated by relative ingroup prototypicality...|$|R
