30|$|The rest of {{the paper}} {{is devoted to the}} {{comparison}} of the three approaches in terms of in-band distortion, <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emission</b> and realizable PAPR.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{transmit}} a signal without distortion, the OFDM system requires {{a more expensive}} power amplifier with high linearity and a wide dynamic range. Besides, the nonlinear distortions due to clipping and amplification effects in the transmitted signal will lead to both in-band and <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emissions</b> [7]. In-band distortions will only degrade {{the performance of the}} OFDM system whereas <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emissions</b> will also disturb services in adjacent transmission bands. Normally, <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emissions</b> have therefore to be reduced below specified power levels to comply with a given spectrum mask [8].|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} improve both power and {{spectral}} efficiency, countermeasures {{have to be put}} in place. Transmitter techniques, known as digital predistortion (DPD), pre-process the signal with an equivalent inverse channel function to reduce the generated interference while receiver equalization (EQ) performs traditional interference cancellation [6]. Mitigation techniques usually have different goals. Compared to terrestrial telecommunications where DPD techniques mainly aim to suppress the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emissions</b> [7], satellite communications aim to reduce in-band signal distortion [8, 9] since the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emissions</b> are cut-out by the onboard multiplexing filter following the HPA in the satellite transponder.|$|R
50|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that using this carrier frequency is not legal as emissions extend beyond the 4 MHz band edge. High quality communications receivers or selective level meters generally have better dynamic range than all but the best spectrum analyzers. Properly used, they do {{an excellent job of}} indicating <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emissions.</b> While some people reporting out-of-band operation might use a wide receiver bandwidth, receiver bandwidth adds to transmitter bandwidth, so the perception is bandwidth is wider than the true bandwidth. Any measurement of <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emissions</b> should be made using a receiver bandwidth significantly narrower than the transmitter bandwidth.|$|R
30|$|However, {{as can be}} {{seen from}} Figure 10, the {{cancelling}} pulses show obvious discontinuity which would produce substantial <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emission.</b> To mitigate the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emission,</b> a filter can be applied to smooth the discontinuities, and the resulting waveform of the smoothed cancelling pulse is also denoted by the dashed curve in Figure 10. In our method, we use a simple moving average filter as a smoothing filter, with which the out-of-band spurious level caused by non-continuous cancelling pulses can be reduced. Note that the smoothing filter is actually optional as we can still obtain a moderate <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emission</b> without it, considering that the occurrence of high peaks is a rare event [3]. The smoothing filter is only necessary in the ACLR-prior circumstance. Normally, a short-length smoothing filter is adequate to further improve the ACLR performance. As the filter length is very short, it gives negligible effect on EVM.|$|E

30|$|In this section, {{we study}} the power {{spectral}} density (PSD) of the transmitted CB-FMT signal. The PSD is an important aspect to evaluate the confinement of the transmitted spectrum. The objective is to limit the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emissions.</b> More in general, the PSD must comply to regulatory aspects that typically set an upper limit, also known as spectrum mask, e.g., as in the IEEE 802.11 WLAN standard [21] or in the HomePlug PLC system [22].|$|R
40|$|An {{experiment}} is described which has permitted direct {{measurement of the}} effects from coupling <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emission</b> through the third-order intermodulation product into the astronomical band of interest, {{as a function of}} the degree of compression of a front-end amplifier. The coupling was measured by injecting a 1545 MHz tone into four of the VLA’s FE amplifiers, and measuring the phase and amplitude of the 1665 MHz OH maser at its ‘reflected ’ frequency of 1425 MHz, as the saturating tone power was varied. We find the following effects: • The effective gain of the compressed amplifiers for astronomical signals is reduced by about twice the compression level. • The correlation coefficient of in-band emission is reduced by ∼ 5 % at 1 dB compression, and by ∼ 20 % at 3 dB compression, due to the addition of incoherent <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emission.</b> • <b>Out-of-band</b> <b>emission</b> is reflected into the band of interest at a level of about 1 % of its natural strength at 1 dB compression, and ∼ 25 % at 3 dB compression. • The phase of the reflected emission rotates at typically twice the natural fringe rate, relative to the fringe-stopped emission in the observing band. The rapid phase rotation of the reflected emission will in general provide considerable attenuation of these signals in interferometric imaging. ...|$|E

This is calculated based on its waveform especially the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emission</b> level.

The GSC performs the fragmentation according to the traffic loads of each operator and may also depend on the preferred fragments of each operator.|$|E
40|$|International audienceTo meet an ever {{increasing}} demand {{of the spectrum}} for communication between aircrafts and ground terminals, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based Lband (960 - 1164 MHz) Digital Aeronautical Communication System (LDACS) has been recently proposed {{as an alternative to}} existing narrowband systems. However, OFDM based LDACS needs additional control signaling for time and frequency alignment and the use of cylic prefix and high <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emission</b> limits the spectrum utilization efficiency to less than 50 %. In this paper, a new waveform has been proposed which offers better spectrum utilization than OFDM without compromising on computational complexity and interference to legacy users in L-band. It also allows transceivers to dynamically adapt the transmission bandwidth to meet the desired quality of service. Since the proposed waveform employs a reconfigurable multiband linear phase filter, it is referred as reconfigurable filtered OFDM (RF-OFDM). Simulation results and extensive analysis show that the proposed RF-OFDM offers around 40 dB better <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emission</b> than OFDM which in turn leads to significant increase in the transmission bandwidth for a given BER and interference constraints. The computational complexity of RF-OFDM is slightly higher than that of OFDM but it is significantly less than other waveforms making RF-OFDM an attractive waveform for next generation air-to-ground communications...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{predistortion}} (DPD) is a baseband {{signal processing}} technique that corrects for impairments in RF power amplifiers (PAs).

30|$|Given the {{designed}} {{properties of}} the transmitted signal, the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emissions</b> can be partially mitigated by additional filtering. For example, one can apply additional high-order low-pass filtering to the modulating signal or band-pass filtering to the modulated carrier. However, the bandwidth of those additional filters must be sufficiently large {{in comparison with the}} bandwidth of the pulse shaping filter in the modulator in order to not significantly affect the designed signal. Within that bandwidth, the above analysis still generally holds, and the impulsive disturbances may significantly exceed the thermal noise level in the receiver [3] even when the average power of the interference remains below that level.|$|R
30|$|The key concept {{proposed}} by us is to apply advanced, adaptive spectrum shaping algorithms originally considered {{to be used in}} non-contiguous multicarrier transmission schemes [14]. These solutions can guarantee a significant reduction of unwanted <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emission</b> even in a very narrow frequency band at a reasonable complexity. Moreover, these algorithms can be applied {{at the beginning of a}} frame, allowing for a precalculation of the required spectrum masks (filter shapes).

30|$|The {{signals from}} the GW are {{channelized}} to the satellite HPA through a wideband input multiplexing (IMUX) filter.

Traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) are the HPAs predominantly used onboard and are intrinsically nonlinear. Further, the TWTAs used in Ku band can be assumed to have a transfer characteristic largely independent of the frequency [20]. Subsequently, the output multiplexing (OMUX) filter is used to reduce the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emission</b> before relaying the HPA output to the antenna sub-system.|$|E

30|$|Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) technology, which divides the total bandwidth into several orthogonal sub-bands, provides {{the flexibility of}} deactivating specific subcarriers simply by using zeros as the corresponding input values. Because of this, OFDM has been considered {{as a candidate for}} CR in the first cognitive radio-based standard IEEE 802.22 [4]. OFDM has several favorable properties like high spectrum efficiency, robustness to channel fading, multipath delay spread tolerance, efficient fast Fourier transform (FFT) implementation, etc. (for example, in [5 – 7]). However, one of the major problems is the large sidelobes of all OFDM subcarriers.

The design issue of effective peak-canceling pulses under the constraint on the <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emission</b> is addressed. In order to reduce its hardware complexity, a novel approach for generating peak-canceling pulses was also presented.

It exploits the pulse shape as an additional degree of freedom for multicarrier modulation systems. The principle of OFDM with pulse shaping has been introduced in [13]. One of the main criteria for pulse shape design is the time-frequency localization (TFL), which has been identified in [14] as an important target to achieve low <b>out-of-band</b> <b>emissions</b> and low interference induced in doubly dispersive channels. Furthermore, [15 – 17] investigated the pulse shape optimization framework considering realistic channel knowledge. However, these resulting pulse shapes usually span over several successive symbols, rendering them not well suited for selected scenarios like short-block low-latency transmission or fast time division duplex (TDD) uplink-downlink switching. To address this practical issue, [18, 19] proposed some analytic solutions for the design of short pulse shapes for specific settings.|$|R
