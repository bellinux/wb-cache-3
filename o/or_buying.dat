By 1939, over {{two thirds of the}} newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry. The NSDAP daily newspaper, the Völkischer Beobachter ("Ethnic Observer"), was edited by Alfred Rosenberg, author of The Myth of the Twentieth Century, a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority. Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. His propaganda ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely. Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content and partly because of the surge in popularity of radio.|$|E

40|$|Cross-functional make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> {{decision}} {{processes are}} strategic decision processes. The {{outcome of a}} make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision affects competitive advantage, strategic development and leads to changes in internal and external relations. When {{trying to make a}} strategic decision concerning make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> there are several functions {{that will have to be}} included, since the decision requires input regarding both existing and future possibilities. Furthermore, the outcome of the decision will affect the organisation not only in the long-term but also in its day-to-day operations. These are all important reasons for designing and managing the cross-functional make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision process. Current research indicates that there is no one best way in which all organizations can reach make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decisions but that these processes need to be cross-functional. There is a need to understand the functional involvement with its differences and consequences in make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision processes. The purpose of this dissertation is to develop knowledge of design and management of cross-functional make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision processes. The main contribution of the literature used in this dissertation is to establish existing research in the field of cross-functional make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision processes. Several decision process models are outlined and their pros-and-cons are analysed. The research gaps found are the basis for three research questions that together lead to the development of knowledge regarding design and management of cross-functional make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision processes. Empirical data were collected from an in-depth, longitudinal case study and two shorter case studies. The cross-functional make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision process is an iterative process including at least five phases, from initiating an investigation to follow-up on the outcome. The process needs different depth of functional integration in the phases in order to be able to move forward efficiently. Therefore, the cross-functional integration is shifting in the five phases, making the process change in resources. The design of the cross-functional make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision process is shaped by at least eight characteristics. These characteristics are organizational position, time for development, complexity of products, designation of process owner, make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> strategy, production systems, customer relations and supplier relations. They shape the design by determining which functions should be involved, the extent of their involvement, which phases are needed, the number of options for make <b>or</b> <b>buy,</b> formality of the process, importance of the process, information flows and process time, thus due to the process being cross-functional there are consequences. The cross-functional make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision process has disadvantages with regards to several information flows, several functional strategies, power distribution and resource-consumption. However, the advantage is that a focused make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> strategy can be obtained, resources allocated correctly, and an up-to-date view of the internal and external environment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} that the make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> is a strategic decision and {{has implications for}} the overall corporate strategy of the organisation by describing a model which involves analysing a number of strategic factors. In recent years, many companies have been moving significantly away from “making” towards “buying”. However, research has revealed that make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decisions are rarely taken within a thoroughly strategic perspective. It {{has been shown that}} many firms adopt a short-term perspective and are motivated primarily by the search for short-term cost reductions. It is argued that make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decisions are made most frequently by default with little consideration for the long-run competitiveness of the organisation. An outline of three key problems encountered by companies in their efforts to formulate an effective make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision is presented, in order to illustrate the weaknesses in current make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> practice. The make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> model described in this paper attempts to overcome these problems by offering an organisation a conceptual framework to follow in the sourcing decision...|$|R

Viewed from a third person over-the-shoulder perspective, in typical action-adventure fashion Ryu starts the game with basic, low-level abilities and weapons that can be upgraded as he progresses, by discovering <b>or</b> <b>buying</b> items. In keeping with his ninja persona, his character can interact with the game environment to perform acrobatic feats, such as running along and jumping off walls, swinging from pole to pole, or running across water. The game world {{is made up of}} several distinct regions, most of which are connected via the city of Tairon, which functions as a hub. Access to these regions are obtained by fighting enemies, finding keys, or solving puzzles, inspired by the mechanics of The Legend of Zelda video games.

25|$|African slavery {{became more}} common in Brazil during the mid 16th century, though the {{enslavement}} of indigenous people continued into the 17th and even the 18th century in the backlands of Brazil. Indigenous slaves remained much cheaper during this time than their African counterparts, though they did suffer horrendous death rates from European diseases. Although the average African slave lived to only be twenty-three years old due to terrible work conditions, this was still about four years longer than Indigenous slaves, which was a big contribution to high price of African slaves. Even though prices for indigenous slaves were cheaper, {{there was never a}} focus on maintaining slave families.

However, the gentrification of both cities has led to older tenants of shophouses driven out by the rising costs of renting <b>or</b> <b>buying</b> properties within historical districts.

25|$|Despite initial interdictions {{under the}} Russian {{occupation}} of 1829 (when {{it was first}} regulated that non-Christians {{were not to be}} regarded as citizens), many of the new immigrants became leaseholders of estates and tavern-keepers, serving to increase both the revenue and demands of boyars - leading in turn to an increase in economic pressures over those working the land <b>or</b> <b>buying</b> products (usual prejudice against Jews accused tavern-keepers of encouraging alcoholism). At the same time, several Jews rose to prominence and high social status - most families involved in Moldavian banking around the 1850s were of Jewish origin. After 1832, following adoption of the Organic Statute, Jewish children are accepted in schools in the two Principalities only if they wore the same clothing as others. In Moldavia, authorities forced the community to abandon its traditional dress code through the 1847 decree of Prince Mihail Sturdza.|$|E

The MMC report into the takeover would not be issued until January 1998, and would recommend that the deal could only go ahead if Capital Gold was sold or Virgin's London FM licence was left out of the deal.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the dimensions along which make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision processes change over time. Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a longitudinal in-depth case study of a large industrial company, where the data were collected using interviews, documentation and observations. The data were analyzed using chronological patterns, and findings were then compared with the literature on make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision processes. Findings Nine dimensions were found along which the make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision process had changed over time. The dimensions were cross-functionality, structure, regularity, formality, awareness, mandatory, information distribution and management and flexibility. The causes of the changes were related to a combination of company internal and external events and contexts. Research limitations/implications The findings should be seen as a first attempt in assisting in the creation of a foundation for constructing more dynamic make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision process models. However, since the findings are based on a single case, they need to be complemented by more research in order to help determine how context sensitive the identified dimensions are. Practical implications The nine dimensions of change can be used as a checklist for managers in designing their decision process. Originality/value The paper adds to existing research, which takes a static viewpoint and does not include a dynamic perspective, in that, the longitudinal nature of our research creates opportunities for developing more dynamic make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision process models. The paper clarifies how make <b>or</b> <b>buy</b> decision processes develop over time, and how they cannot be seen as a one-time implementation but rather as a process that needs both structure and flexibility...|$|R
