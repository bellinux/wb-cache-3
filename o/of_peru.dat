5|$|The Royal Audiencia of Quito (or Presidency of Quito) was {{established}} {{as part of}} the Spanish State by Philip II of Spain on August 29, 1563. It was a court of the Spanish Crown with jurisdiction over certain territories of the Viceroyalty <b>of</b> <b>Peru</b> (and later the Viceroyalty of New Granada) that now constitute Ecuador and parts <b>of</b> <b>Peru,</b> Colombia and Brazil. The Royal Audiencia was created to strengthen administrative control over those territories and to rule the relations between whites and the natives. Its capital was the city of Quito.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Lima, the capital <b>of</b> <b>Peru,</b> began with its {{foundation}} by Francisco Pizarro on January 18, 1535. The city was established on {{the valley of}} the Rímac River in an area populated by the Ichma polity. It became the capital of the Viceroyalty <b>of</b> <b>Peru</b> and site of a Real Audiencia in 1543. In the 17th century, the city prospered as the center of an extensive trade network despite damage from earthquakes and the threat of pirates. However, prosperity came to an end in the 18th century due to an economic downturn and the Bourbon Reforms.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} of Lima played an ambivalent {{role in the}} 1821–1824 Peruvian War of Independence; the city suffered exactions from Royalist and Patriot armies alike. After independence, Lima became {{the capital of the}} Republic <b>of</b> <b>Peru.</b> It enjoyed a short period of prosperity in the mid-19th century until the 1879–1883 War of the Pacific when it was occupied and looted by Chilean troops. After the war, the city went through a period of demographic expansion and urban renewal. Population growth accelerated in the 1940s spurred by immigration from the Andean regions <b>of</b> <b>Peru.</b> This gave rise to the proliferation of shanty towns as public services failed {{to keep up with the}} city expansion.|$|E

With this approval, the authority in Lima, the support of the northern provinces and the port of El Callao under siege, San Martín declared the independence <b>of</b> <b>Peru</b> on 28 July 1821.
