5|$|Finally, {{the motives}} they {{suggested}} for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Richard Owen wanted to forge {{evidence in support}} of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.|$|E
5|$|Many {{legends and}} fantastic stories about Anne Boleyn have survived over the centuries. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> she was {{secretly}} buried in Salle Church in Norfolk under a black slab near the tombs of her ancestors. Her body {{was said to}} have rested in an Essex church on its journey to Norfolk. Another is that her heart, at her request, was buried in Erwarton (Arwarton) Church, Suffolk by her uncle Sir Philip Parker.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} of the ice giants, Neptune and Uranus, has proven difficult to model precisely. Current models suggest that the matter density in the outer regions of the Solar System was too low {{to account for the}} {{formation of}} such large bodies from the traditionally accepted method of core accretion, and various hypotheses have been advanced to explain their formation. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the ice giants were not formed by core accretion but from instabilities within the original protoplanetary disc and later had their atmospheres blasted away by radiation from a nearby massive OB star.|$|E

50|$|In the 16th century {{there were}} two last Prodančić family {{branches}} left. <b>One</b> of them <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of Petar (~ 1504-1563), son of Nikola, and the other <b>one</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> of Stephen (Stefano/Stjepan/Stijepo; 1566-1638), who was the last male member of the family.|$|R
50|$|Under-capitalization {{refers to}} any {{situation}} where a business cannot acquire the funds they need. An under-capitalized business may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> cannot afford current operational expenses {{due to a}} lack of capital, which can trigger bankruptcy, may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> over-exposed to risk, or may <b>be</b> <b>one</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> financially sound but does not have the funds required to expand to meet market demand.|$|R
5|$|There are {{a number}} of common threads found in criticisms of the flag of {{convenience}} system. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> these flag states have insufficient regulations and that those regulations they do have are poorly enforced. Another is that, in many cases, the flag state cannot identify a shipowner, much less hold the owner civilly or criminally responsible for a ship's actions. As a result of this lack of flag state control, flags of convenience are criticized on grounds of providing an environment for conducting criminal activities, supporting terrorism, providing poor working conditions for seafarers, and having an adverse effect on the environment.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} about why the hoard was buried. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the hoard represented a deliberate attempt to keep wealth safe, perhaps in response to one of the many upheavals facing Roman Britain in the early fifth century. This is not the only hypothesis, however. Archaeologist Peter Guest argues that the hoard was buried because the items in it were used as part of a system of gift-exchange, and as Britain separated from the Roman Empire, they were no longer required. A third hypothesis is that the Hoxne Hoard represents the proceeds of a robbery, buried to avoid detection.|$|E
5|$|There are a {{wide range}} of {{additional}} critiques as well. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> NIRA's industry codes interfered with capital markets, inhibiting economic recovery. But more recent analyses conclude that NIRA had little effect on capital markets one way or the other. Another is that political uncertainty created by the NRA caused a drop in business confidence, inhibiting recovery. But at least one study has shown no effect whatsoever.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{interpretations of the}} {{symbolism}} behind the commonly represented image of Kaali standing on Shiva's supine form. A common <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Shiva symbolizes purusha, the universal unchanging aspect of reality, or pure consciousness. Kaali represents Prakriti, nature or matter, sometimes seen as having a feminine quality. The merging of these two qualities represent ultimate reality.|$|E
5|$|Two {{external}} factors had their impacts on Verdi's compositions of this period. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> with increasing reputation and financial security {{he no longer}} needed to commit himself to the productive treadmill, had more freedom to choose his own subjects, and {{had more time to}} develop them according to his own ideas. In the years 1849 to 1859 he wrote eight new operas, compared with fourteen in the previous ten years.|$|E
5|$|Two hazards {{are uniquely}} {{identified}} with the dam. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, {{and the other is}} that the dam sits on a seismic fault. At current levels, 80% of the land in the area is experiencing erosion, depositing about 40million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream, and there will be less sediment downstream.|$|E

5|$|Using fossil evidence, {{there are}} three main {{theories}} for the origin of modern amphibians. <b>One</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they evolved from dissorophoid temnospondyls. Another is that they evolved from lepospondyls, most likely the lysorophians. A third hypothesis is that caecilians descended from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolved from dissorophoids.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} factors {{that make it}} {{difficult}} to determine when exactly Hispanics began to serve in the Corps; <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> statistics on Hispanics were not kept by the military until the 1970s when the United States Census Bureau coined the phrase. Before then only unreliable estimates were made. For example, during World War II Hispanic Americans were estimated to comprise 2.3% to 4.7% of the Armed Forces. However, the exact number is unknown, as at the time Hispanics were integrated into the general white population census count. Separate statistics were kept for African Americans and Asian Americans. Another factor is that the estimates which have been made only take into account individuals whose surname is of Hispanic origin, when there are many Hispanics with non-Hispanic surnames who have served.|$|E
