5|$|She {{suffered}} from poor health and had several surgeries to correct problems with <b>osteoporosis.</b> During her presidential campaign, {{she was on}} crutches {{most of the time}} due to a fractured kneecap {{as a result of her}} <b>osteoporosis.</b> She later developed a brain tumor, which has kept her out of public life.|$|E
5|$|Anti-inflammatory {{drugs are}} often used to control the effects of inflammation. Glucocorticoids are the most {{powerful}} of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, <b>osteoporosis,</b> and their use must be tightly controlled. Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs {{are often used}} in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{its role}} in facilitating iron uptake, copper {{deficiency}} can produce anemia-like symptoms, neutropenia, bone abnormalities, hypopigmentation, impaired growth, increased incidence of infections, <b>osteoporosis,</b> hyperthyroidism, and abnormalities in glucose and cholesterol metabolism. Conversely, Wilson's disease causes an accumulation of copper in body tissues.|$|E
5|$|Mutant Huntingtin is {{expressed}} {{throughout the body}} and associated with abnormalities in peripheral tissues that are directly caused by such expression outside the brain. These abnormalities include muscle atrophy, cardiac failure, impaired glucose tolerance, weight loss, <b>osteoporosis,</b> and testicular atrophy.|$|E
5|$|Several hormone {{deficiencies}} {{associated with}} hypopituitarism {{may lead to}} secondary diseases. For instance, growth hormone deficiency is associated with obesity, raised cholesterol and the metabolic syndrome, and estradiol deficiency may lead to <b>osteoporosis.</b> While effective treatment of the underlying hormone deficiencies may improve these risks, it is often necessary to treat them directly.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{concentration}} of cadmium is {{absorbed in the}} kidneys of humans, and up to about 30mg of cadmium is commonly inhaled throughout human childhood and adolescence. Cadmium is under preliminary research for its toxicity in humans, potentially affecting mechanisms and risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and <b>osteoporosis.</b>|$|E
5|$|COPD often occurs {{along with}} a number of other {{conditions}}, due in part to shared risk factors. These conditions include ischemic heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, muscle wasting, <b>osteoporosis,</b> lung cancer, anxiety disorder, sexual dysfunction, and depression. In those with severe disease, a feeling of always being tired is common. Fingernail clubbing is not specific to COPD and should prompt investigations for an underlying lung cancer.|$|E
5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is {{the manifestation of}} glucocorticoid excess. It can {{be the result of}} a prolonged treatment with glucocorticoids or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), <b>osteoporosis,</b> depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E
5|$|Deficiency of {{luteinizing hormone}} (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), {{together}} {{referred to as}} the gonadotropins, leads to different symptoms in men and women. Women experience oligo- or amenorrhea (infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively) and infertility. Men lose facial, scrotal and trunk hair, as well as suffering decreased muscle mass and anemia. Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function, and have an increased risk of <b>osteoporosis</b> (bone fragility). Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed puberty.|$|E
5|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer has {{classified}} cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans. Although {{occupational exposure}} to cadmium {{is linked to}} lung and prostate cancer, {{there is still a}} substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low environmental exposure. Recent data from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet associates to higher risk of endometrial, breast and prostate cancer as well as to <b>osteoporosis</b> in humans. A recent study has demonstrated that endometrial tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former smoking females.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences {{between women and men}} exist. Women also need health care more and access the health care system more than do men. While part of this is due to their reproductive and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and <b>osteoporosis.</b> Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero to aging effect the growth, development and health of women. The life-course perspective {{is one of the key}} strategies of the World Health Organization.|$|E
5|$|As calcium {{is heavily}} {{involved}} in bone manufacture, many bone diseases {{can be traced to}} problems with the organic matrix or the hydroxyapatite in molecular structure or organisation. For example, <b>osteoporosis</b> is a reduction in mineral content of bone per unit volume, and can be treated by supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and biphosphates. Calcium supplements may benefit the serum lipids in women who have passed menopause as well as older men; in post-menopausal women calcium supplementation also appears to be inversely correlated with cardiovascular disease. Inadequate amounts of calcium, vitamin D, or phosphates can lead to the softening of bones, known as osteomalacia.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether men or women have higher rates of low back pain. A 2012 review {{reported}} a rate of 9.6% among males and 8.7% among females. Another 2012 review found a higher rate in females than males, which the reviewers felt was possibly due to greater rates of pains due to <b>osteoporosis,</b> menstruation, and pregnancy among women, or possibly because women were more willing to report pain than men. An estimated 70% of women experience back pain during pregnancy with the rate being higher the further along in pregnancy. Current smokers – and especially those who are adolescents – {{are more likely to have}} low back pain than former smokers, and former smokers are more likely to have low back pain than those who have never smoked.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} {{is not a}} {{specific}} disease but rather a complaint that {{may be caused by}} a large number of underlying problems of varying levels of seriousness. The majority of LBP does not have a clear cause but {{is believed to be the}} result of non-serious muscle or skeletal issues such as sprains or strains. Obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, poor posture and poor sleeping position may also contribute to low back pain. A full list of possible causes includes many less common conditions. Physical causes may include osteoarthritis, degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae or a spinal disc herniation, broken vertebra(e) (such as from <b>osteoporosis)</b> or, rarely, an infection or tumor of the spine.|$|E
5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, <b>osteoporosis</b> and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E
25|$|Race: While <b>osteoporosis</b> {{occurs in}} {{people from all}} ethnic groups, European or Asian ancestry predisposes for <b>osteoporosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{her work}} on raising {{awareness}} of <b>osteoporosis</b> around the world, the Duchess was honoured with an Ethel LeFrak award in 2005 from an American charity and received a Kohn Award in 2007 from the Royal Society. In July 2007, the Duchess opened the Duchess of Cornwall Centre for <b>Osteoporosis</b> at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, Truro. The same year, King's College London awarded her an honorary fellowship for raising the profile of <b>osteoporosis.</b> The National <b>Osteoporosis</b> Society created The Duchess of Cornwall Award in 2009, which is awarded to other advocates of <b>Osteoporosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Malnutrition, {{parenteral}} nutrition and malabsorption {{can lead to}} <b>osteoporosis.</b> Nutritional and gastrointestinal disorders that can predispose to <b>osteoporosis</b> include undiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease (both symptomatic and asymptomatic people), Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, cystic fibrosis, surgery (after gastrectomy, intestinal bypass surgery or bowel resection) and severe liver disease (especially primary biliary cirrhosis). People with lactose intolerance or milk allergy may develop <b>osteoporosis</b> due to restrictions of calcium-containing foods. Individuals with bulimia can also develop <b>osteoporosis.</b> Those with an otherwise adequate calcium intake can develop <b>osteoporosis</b> due to the inability to absorb calcium and/or vitamin D. Other micronutrients such as vitamin K or vitamin B12 deficiency may also contribute.|$|E
25|$|Prevention of <b>osteoporosis</b> {{includes}} a proper diet during childhood {{and efforts to}} avoid medications that cause the condition. Efforts to prevent broken bones in those with <b>osteoporosis</b> include a good diet, exercise, and fall prevention. Lifestyle changes such as stopping smoking and not drinking alcohol may help. Biphosphonate medications are useful in those with previous broken bones due to <b>osteoporosis.</b> In those with <b>osteoporosis</b> but no previous broken bones they are less effective. A number of other medications may also be useful.|$|E
25|$|Bones: Local <b>osteoporosis</b> {{occurs in}} RA around {{inflamed}} joints. It is postulated to be partially caused by inflammatory cytokines. More general <b>osteoporosis</b> is probably contributed to by immobility, systemic cytokine effects, local cytokine release in bone marrow and corticosteroid therapy.|$|E
25|$|Smoking (associated with <b>osteoporosis).</b>|$|E
25|$|Soft drinks: Some studies {{indicate}} soft drinks (many of which contain phosphoric acid) may increase risk of <b>osteoporosis,</b> {{at least in}} women. Others suggest soft drinks may displace calcium-containing drinks from the diet rather than directly causing <b>osteoporosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{physicians}} {{advocate a}} Dexa (bone density) scan {{at the time}} of oophorectomy and every year or two thereafter to diagnose <b>osteoporosis</b> before it becomes severe enough to be symptomatic. This is important because treatment of <b>osteoporosis</b> is most effective if done early.|$|E
25|$|<b>Osteoporosis</b> can be {{minimized}} by smoking cessation, adequate vitamin D intake and regular weight-bearing exercise. The bisphosphate drug alendronate may decrease {{the risk of}} a fracture, in women that have both bone loss and a previous fracture and less so for those with just <b>osteoporosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lifestyle {{prevention}} of <b>osteoporosis</b> {{is in many}} aspects the inverse of the potentially modifiable risk factors. As tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with <b>osteoporosis,</b> smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it.|$|E
25|$|Risk {{factors for}} {{osteoporotic}} fracture can be split between nonmodifiable and (potentially) modifiable. In addition, <b>osteoporosis</b> is a recognized complication of specific diseases and disorders. Medication use is theoretically modifiable, although in many cases, {{the use of}} medication that increases <b>osteoporosis</b> risk may be unavoidable.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine {{is not a}} {{risk factor}} for <b>osteoporosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chronic lithium {{therapy has}} been {{associated}} with <b>osteoporosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|About 22 {{million women}} and 5.5 million {{men in the}} European Union had <b>osteoporosis</b> in 2010. In the United States in 2010 about 8 million women and one to 2 million men had <b>osteoporosis.</b> This places a large {{economic}} burden on the healthcare system due to costs of treatment, long-term disability, and loss of productivity in the working population. The EU spends 37 billion euros per year in healthcare costs related to <b>osteoporosis,</b> and the USA spends an estimated 19 billion USD annually for related healthcare costs.|$|E
25|$|There are 8.9 million {{fractures}} worldwide {{per year}} due to <b>osteoporosis.</b> Globally, 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men {{over the age}} of 50 will have an osteoporotic fracture. Data from the United States shows a decrease in <b>osteoporosis</b> within the general population and in white women, from 18% in 1994 to 10% in 2006. White and Asian people are at greater risk. People of African descent are at a decreased risk of fractures due to <b>osteoporosis,</b> although they have the highest risk of death following an osteoporotic fracture.|$|E
25|$|Heredity: Those with {{a family}} history of {{fracture}} or <b>osteoporosis</b> are at an increased risk; the heritability of the fracture, as well as low bone mineral density, is relatively high, ranging from 25 to 80%. At least 30 genes are associated with the development of <b>osteoporosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Weight-bearing {{endurance}} exercise and/or {{exercises to}} strengthen muscles improve bone strength {{in those with}} <b>osteoporosis.</b> Aerobics, weight bearing, and resistance exercises all maintain or increase BMD in postmenopausal women. Fall prevention can help prevent <b>osteoporosis</b> complications. There is some evidence for hip protectors specifically {{among those who are}} in care homes.|$|E
25|$|Studies in mice {{suggest that}} the pineal-derived {{melatonin}} regulates new bone deposition. Pineal-derived melatonin mediates its action on the bone cells through MT2 receptors. This pathway could be a potential new target for <b>osteoporosis</b> treatment as the study shows the curative effect of oral melatonin treatment in a postmenopausal <b>osteoporosis</b> mouse model.|$|E
25|$|People with rheumatologic {{disorders}} such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic {{lupus erythematosus}} and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis {{are at increased risk}} of <b>osteoporosis,</b> either as part of their disease or because of other risk factors (notably corticosteroid therapy). Systemic diseases such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis can also lead to <b>osteoporosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{biomarkers}} are {{a useful}} tool in detecting bone degradation. The enzyme cathepsin K breaks down type-I collagen protein, an important constituent in bones. Prepared antibodies can recognize the resulting fragment, called a neoepitope, {{as a way to}} diagnose <b>osteoporosis.</b> Increased urinary excretion of C-telopeptides, a type-I collagen breakdown product, also serves as a biomarker for <b>osteoporosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Age-related {{bone loss}} is common among humans due to exhibiting less dense bones than other primate species. Because {{of the more}} porous bones of humans, {{frequency}} of severe <b>osteoporosis</b> and <b>osteoporosis</b> related fractures is higher. The human vulnerability to <b>osteoporosis</b> is an obvious cost {{but it can be}} justified by the advantage of bipedalism inferring that this vulnerability is the byproduct of such. It has been suggested that porous bones help to absorb the increased stress that we have on two surfaces compared to our primate counterparts who have four surfaces to disperse the force. In addition, the porosity allows for more flexibility and a lighter skeleton that is easier to support. One other consideration may be that diets today have much lower amounts of calcium than the diets of other primates or the tetrapedal ancestors to humans which may lead to higher likelihood to show signs of <b>osteoporosis.</b>|$|E
