5|$|At present, {{there are}} two ways to get to Arad: by air or road. The only highway {{connecting}} Arad with the rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> Highway 31, which connects it with Beersheba to the west, and the Dead Sea to the east. It has two junctions within Arad's municipal area—the Arad Junction (within the city itself, with Road 3199), and the Tel Arad Junction (with Highway 80). The local Road 3199 connects Arad with Masada, but does not connect to the road next to the dead sea (Highway 90). It is therefore the only way to get to Masada's western side.|$|E

Among the numerous flowers and shrubs are hibiscus, flame lily, snake lily, spider lily, leonotus, cassia, tree wisteria and dombeya. There are around 350 species of mammals that can be found in Zimbabwe. There are also many snakes and lizards, over 500 bird species, and 131 fish species.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse also refuted {{the claim}} that if a country's {{geographical}} area is large, {{the size of its}} market also ought to be large. A country may be extremely small in area but still have a large effective demand. For example, Japan. In contrast, a country may cover a huge geographical area but its market may still be small. This may occur if a large part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> uninhabitable, or if the country suffers from low productivity levels and thus has a low National Income.|$|E

After ruling the country for 22 years, they were defeated by Asela (215–205 BC), who was in turn overthrown by another invasion led by a Chola prince named Elara (205–161 BC). Elara ruled for 44 years before being defeated by Dutthagamani However, the Mahavamsa records that these foreign kings ruled the country fairly and lawfully.|$|E

While the warm season is from 23 January to 18 March, the cold season lasts from 20 June to 27 August, when rainfall is frequently accompanied by thunderstorms. The city is bordered by thick tropical rainforests along the river banks. Several of its neighbourhoods are in low-lying areas prone to recurrent flooding. Severe rains in June and July 2009 left 11,000 people homeless.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{signs of}} human activity in Leigh are evidenced by a Neolithic stone axe found in Pennington and a bronze spearhead from south of Gas Street.

However evidence for the presence of Saxons in what was a sparsely populated and isolated part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> provided by local township place names that incorporate the Old English suffix leah, such as Leigh, Tyldesley, Shakerley and Astley.|$|E

5|$|The flora <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> varied {{incorporating}} both deciduous and coniferous woodland and moorland and tundra species. However, {{large scale}} commercial tree planting {{and the management}} of upland moorland habitat for the grazing of sheep and commercial field sport activities impacts upon the distribution of indigenous plants and animals. The UK's tallest tree is a grand fir planted beside Loch Fyne, Argyll in the 1870s, and the Fortingall Yew may be 5,000 years old and is probably the oldest living thing in Europe. Although the number of native vascular plants is low by world standards, Scotland's substantial bryophyte flora is of global importance.|$|E
5|$|Travel between Haifa and {{the center}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> {{possible}} by road with Highway 2, the main highway along the coastal plain, beginning at Tel Aviv and ending at Haifa. Furthermore, Highway 4 runs along the coast {{to the north of}} Haifa, as well as south, inland from Highway 2. In the past, traffic along Highway 2 to the north of Haifa had to pass through the downtown area of the city; the Carmel Tunnels, opened for traffic 1 December 2010, now route this traffic under Mount Carmel, reducing congestion in the downtown area.|$|E

5|$|At , Rwanda's {{population}} density is amongst {{the highest in}} Africa. Historians such as Gérard Prunier believe that the 1994 genocide can be partly attributed to the {{population density}}. The population is predominantly rural, with a few large towns; dwellings are evenly spread throughout the country. The only sparsely populated area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> <b>is</b> the savanna land in the former province of Umutara and Akagera National Park in the east. Kigali is the largest city, {{with a population of}} around one million. Its rapidly increasing population challenges its infrastructural development. According to the 2012 census, the second largest city is Gisenyi, which lies adjacent to Lake Kivu and the Congolese city of Goma, and has a population of 126,000. Other major towns include Ruhengeri, Butare, and Gitarama, all with populations below 100,000. The urban population rose from 6% of the population in 1990, to 16.6% in 2006; by 2011, however, the proportion had dropped slightly, to 14.8%.|$|E
