25|$|To {{save the}} project, Marriott agreed {{to scale back}} {{the size of the}} hotel. Shortly after the request for more public funding, District asked Marriott to cut the cost of the {{facility}} by reducing the number of rooms to about 1,000. Marriott agreed to build only 1,150 rooms, and to scrap the underground ballroom and meeting space (saving an estimated $100 million). Marriott and the city also resolved their dispute <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> set-aside for convention business. This issue had been coming to a conclusion since early 2007, when Mayor Fenty gave Marriott a take-it-or-leave-it offer to reserve 80 percent of the rooms for the convention center, so long as convention center business was booked three years in advance. Marriott agreed to the 80 percent set-aside in September.|$|E
500|$|Further tests {{included}} {{the explosion of}} several Type 8 torpedoes filled with 300–346kg (660–760lbs) of picric acid within Tosas designed magazine for them, which was located forward of the first turret and had been considered a weak point in previous battleship designs. This caused [...] "extreme structural damage above the waterline" [...] to Tosa, and confirmed that any problem {{in that part of}} the ship could seriously harm it. Possible solutions {{included the}} installation of additional armor <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> or the use of walls on one side of the magazine that would be blown out and away from the ship in the event of any serious explosion inside. This would have the effect of focusing the explosion outside, minimizing structural damage to the ship itself. Another test involved the explosion of [...] of TNT [...] away from the side of the ship.|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} {{arranged}} that Dick and Dora should depart on a honeymoon trip to Washington late that afternoon. <b>The</b> dinner <b>over,</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> were cleared, {{and the young}} folks enjoyed themselves in dancing, an orchestra having been engaged for that purpose.|$|R
50|$|All {{rooms are}} in largely {{original}} condition, the only changes being to external fanlights to accommodate air conditioners {{and the internal}} fretwork fanlights being covered <b>over.</b> <b>The</b> <b>rooms</b> on <b>the</b> outside corner are larger than the others while <b>the</b> <b>room</b> on <b>the</b> inside corner is totally enclosed but has a central skylight (now covered).|$|R
60|$|The {{time before}} luncheon {{was taken up}} for Gwendolen by going <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> with Mrs. Torrington and Mrs. Davilow; and she thought it likely that if she saw Deronda, there would hardly be need {{for more than a}} bow between them.

2500|$|Investigators {{have not}} said {{whether they have}} had the {{handwriting}} analyzed. The website Crime Watch Daily had an expert, Peggy Walla, look at photos of the note. She noted that it was clean of the blood reportedly found splattered all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> suggesting it was written either away {{from the crime scene}} or beforehand. The writer may have been using their non-dominant hand in an attempt to disguise their handwriting. Walla believes the writer was particularly agitated, likely to the point of homicidal rage, by being called [...] "stupid".|$|E

Each room also features a loft area (accessible by separate stairways) with small windows that look down <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms.</b> These loft rooms serve as a storage area for the Masons.|$|R
50|$|The women {{split up}} and pose as prostitutes, with each seducing {{one of the}} rapists and luring them to a secluded area. The girls have sex with the men, and, when they finish, they remind them {{of the events of}} the {{previous}} year, before gunning them down with automatic firearms, splattering blood, and gore all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R
60|$|Just as it happened, {{a silence}} had fallen <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> for a moment, and {{everybody}} in it heard Wilhelmina's question.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, you have. We will do it! {{we will do}} it!" [...] And {{clapping}} her hands, mamma suddenly {{began to}} dance all <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{as if she had}} lost her wits.|$|E

60|$|The house master left Dick and Sam and the {{two boys}} looked <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> and put {{some of the things}} from their suit cases in the closets and in the bureaus.

5000|$|The {{second level}} is [...] "L" [...] shaped in plan {{with the one}} leg {{extending}} north <b>over</b> <b>the</b> driveway and above the garage and the other leg running to the east. <b>The</b> servants <b>rooms</b> were above <b>the</b> garage.

50|$|The {{building}} was constructed mainly from brick and iron, {{in hopes of}} minimising the risk of fire; only the stage was made of wood.
