40|$|Abstract. <b>Outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> {{liability}} is {{the insurance}} companies’ corporate responsibility towards future debt. There {{are a number}} of existing models used to estimate the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability for long tail business. However, some of the assumptions imposed on these models are not met by the claims data under consideration. Furthermore, trends in the development year and payment year periods are not taken into account by these models. The Probabilistic Trend Family (PTF) model is developed to overcome these problems. In this paper, PTF model is described; and the process of estimating the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability, starting from the preliminary analysis of the claims data to the estimation of the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability is explained. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the obtained estimate of the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability is analyzed using a tool called leverage. Leverage can be used to evaluate the robustness of the model used to estimate the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability. Keywords : <b>Outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> liability, long tail business, development year period, payment year period, probabilistic trend family, sensitivity, leverage. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> produced by a homogeneous general insurance portfolio. The specific model considered in this paper is one where the number of claims in any loss period follows a Poisson distribution, settlement delays follow the same multinomial distribution, and settlements are single lump sums that are independent identically distributed random variables. Simulations using this model reveal that the development ratios and the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> estimates produced using the chain ladder method are positively biased. We obtain approximate formulas for the biases using Taylor series expansions of the random variables about their means. The same methods ale used to obtain approximations for the variances and covariances of the projection ratios and the <b>outstanding</b> <b>claims</b> estimates. A simulation study reveals that OUI formulas ale highly accurate. 21 page(s...|$|R

50|$|Following {{a series}} of {{encounters}} from May to November 1946 in the Corfu Channel between the United Kingdom and the Peoples Republic of Albania—one of which resulted in damage to two Royal Navy ships and significant loss of life—the United Kingdom brought suit in the ICJ seeking reparations.

This amount remained unpaid for decades, and British efforts to see it paid led to another ICJ case to resolve competing Albanian and Italian claims to more than two tons of Nazi gold.

40|$|In recent decades, a {{wide variety}} of {{stochastic}} methods for estimating <b>outstanding</b> <b>claim</b> reserves were developed. The uncertainty of such point estimates may be calculated analytically for some models but often this is cumbersome or impossible to do. Here, we followed a bootstrap approach to estimate the standard error of the claim reserves. We applied the bootstrap on some well-known stochastic methods, namely the distribution free model of Mack and the log-normal model. Beside this, we incorporated these methods in a multivariate context to retrieve an aggregate reserve range for several lines of business. Moreover, we investigated the influence of outliers and correlation occurring respectively in and between the triangles. Here, we present a method to compare the different reserving techniques. Therefore, we have stripped off the diagonal from the regular triangle. In this way all information about the most recent year is lost, but this information will be used to discuss the quality of the prediction. As financial analysts do not always conform the same attitude towards risk, our comparison covers different value-at-risk percentiles.
