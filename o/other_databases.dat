25|$|The SAG {{standardization}} efforts {{presented an}} opportunity for Microsoft to adapt their Jet system to the new CLI standard. This would not only make Windows a premier platform for CLI development, but also allow users to use SQL to access both Jet and <b>other</b> <b>databases</b> as well. What was missing was the SQL parser that could convert those calls from their text form into the C-interface used in Jet. To solve this, MS partnered with PageAhead Software to use their existing query processor, SIMBA. SIMBA {{was used as a}} parser above Jet's C library, turning Jet into an SQL database. And because Jet could forward those C-based calls to <b>other</b> <b>databases,</b> this also allowed SIMBA to query other systems. Microsoft included drivers for Excel to turn its spreadsheet documents into SQL-accessible database tables.|$|E

25|$|The Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) {{surveyed}} congregations {{for their}} memberships. Churches were asked for their membership numbers. Adjustments {{were made for}} those congregations that did not respond and for religious groups that reported only adult membership. ARDA estimates {{that most of the}} churches not responding were black Protestant congregations. Significant difference in results from <b>other</b> <b>databases</b> include the lower representation of adherents of 1) all kinds (62.7%), 2) Christians (59.9%), 3) Protestants (less than 36%); and the greater number of unaffiliated (37.3%).|$|E
25|$|Traditionally, {{the basic}} level of {{annotation}} is using BLAST for finding similarities, and then annotating genomes based on homologues. More recently, additional information {{is added to}} the annotation platform. The additional information allows manual annotators to deconvolute discrepancies between genes that are given the same annotation. Some databases use genome context information, similarity scores, experimental data, and integrations of other resources to provide genome annotations through their Subsystems approach. <b>Other</b> <b>databases</b> (e.g. Ensembl) rely on both curated data sources as well as a range of software tools in their automated genome annotation pipeline. Structural annotation consists of the identification of genomic elements, primarily ORFs and their localisation, or gene structure. Functional annotation consists of attaching biological information to genomic elements.|$|E
25|$|Swiss-Prot {{was created}} in 1986 by Amos Bairoch during his PhD and {{developed}} by the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics and subsequently developed by Rolf Apweiler at the European Bioinformatics Institute. Swiss-Prot aimed to provide reliable protein sequences associated {{with a high level}} of annotation (such as the description of the function of a protein, its domain structure, post-translational modifications, variants, etc.), a minimal level of redundancy and high level of integration with <b>other</b> <b>databases.</b> Recognizing that sequence data were being generated at a pace exceeding Swiss-Prot's ability to keep up, TrEMBL (Translated EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Data Library) was created to provide automated annotations for those proteins not in Swiss-Prot. Meanwhile, PIR maintained the PIR-PSD and related databases, including iProClass, a database of protein sequences and curated families.|$|E

25|$|Not {{only is the}} {{information}} contained within the database continually updated, the software itself has gone through several revisions. Version 1.0 of BIND was released in 1999 and based on user feedback it was modified to include additional detail on experimental conditions required for binding and a hierarchical description of cellular location of the interaction. Version 2.0 was released in 2001 and included the capability to link to information available in <b>other</b> <b>databases.</b> Version 3.0 (2002) expanded the database from physical/biochemical interactions to also include genetic interactions. Version 3.5 (2004) included a refined user-interface that aimed to simplify information retrieval. In 2006, BIND was incorporated into the Biomolecular Object Network Database (BOND) where {{it continues to be}} updated and improved.|$|E
25|$|Sanger {{sequencing}} and pyrosequencing are {{two methods}} {{that have been}} used to detect frameshift mutations, however, it is likely that data generated will not be of the highest quality. Even still, 1.96 million indels have been identified through Sanger sequencing that do not overlap with <b>other</b> <b>databases.</b> When a frameshift mutation is observed it is compared against the Human Genome Mutation Database (HGMD) to determine if the mutation has a damaging effect. This is done by looking at four features. First, the ratio between the affected and conserved DNA, second the location of the mutation relative to the transcript, third the ratio of conserved and affected amino acids and finally the distance of the indel {{to the end of the}} exon.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people use}} the terms Internet and World Wide Web, or just the Web, interchangeably, but the two terms are not synonymous. The World Wide Web is the primary {{application}} program that billions of people use on the Internet, and it has changed their lives immeasurably. However, the Internet provides many other services. The Web is a global set of documents, images and other resources, logically interrelated by hyperlinks and referenced with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs). URIs symbolically identify services, servers, and <b>other</b> <b>databases,</b> and the documents and resources that they can provide. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web. Web services also use HTTP to allow software systems to communicate in order to share and exchange business logic and data.|$|E

25|$|SQL Server also {{provides}} the optimistic concurrency control mechanism, {{which is similar}} to the multiversion concurrency control used in <b>other</b> <b>databases.</b> The mechanism allows a new version of a row to be created whenever the row is updated, as opposed to overwriting the row, i.e., a row is additionally identified by the ID of the transaction that created the version of the row. Both the old as well as the new versions of the row are stored and maintained, though the old versions are moved out of the database into a system database identified as Tempdb. When a row {{is in the process of}} being updated, any other requests are not blocked (unlike locking) but are executed on the older version of the row. If the other request is an update statement, it will result in two different versions of the rows—both of them will be stored by the database, identified by their respective transaction IDs.|$|E
25|$|The site {{features}} {{cold case}} disappearances and unidentified decedents, in hopes to create awareness for such cases and to generate potential leads. Those documented have occurred during or {{before the year}} 2013. Case files are created for both unidentified and missing persons, detailing physical estimations of the subjects as well as circumstances of the disappearance, sightings and recovery of the unidentified subjects. Images of the missing and unidentified, including forensic facial reconstructions, tattoos, and age progressions are also available for cases. Cases of murder conviction without a body are also listed, although their cases have been solved, as the victim could possibly remain unidentified. The site provides an online form for visitors to submit potential matches between missing and unidentified persons, which are subsequently reviewed by volunteers prior to submission to authorities. After the form is completed by a reader, 16 members of the Doe Network's administrative panel evaluate {{the importance of the}} possible match and whether or not to submit it to investigators handling the case. The Web site also works alongside <b>other</b> <b>databases,</b> such as the National Missing and Unidentified Persons System and the NCIC. The Doe Network features worldwide cases and is also presented in various languages.|$|E
500|$|Commentators {{expressed}} concern about the country's increasing surveillance. In August 2004, the information commissioner, Richard Thomas, drawing a parallel with the way that governments in Eastern Europe and Spain gained too much power and information in the 20th century, {{expressed concern}} over this and other national databases, including the Citizen Information Project, NHS National Programme for IT, and the introduction of identity cards, warning that there was a danger of the country 'sleepwalk into a surveillance society'. On 18 April 2006, Des Browne, the Secretary of State for Defence, said 'the Department for Education and Skills should also consider whether there is scope to realise further efficiency and effectiveness benefits through a child population register', and it is thought that the database may be used in conjunction with the National Identity Register and <b>other</b> <b>databases.</b> Phil Booth, national coordinator of NO2ID, a group opposing identity cards, said this was 'cradle-to-grave surveillance'. Conservative Party member of parliament Oliver Heald said, 'there is already public concern at government plans for a compulsory identity card database, a nanny state children's database and a property database for the council tax ...|$|E
