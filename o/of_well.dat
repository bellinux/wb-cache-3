5|$|After World War II, {{a debate}} about whether a country should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse believed that the subject of who should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was that a large amount <b>of</b> <b>well</b> dispersed investment should {{be made in the}} economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, {{it should be noted that}} most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.|$|E
30|$|Figure  5 {{shows that}} as the number <b>of</b> <b>wells</b> increases, the {{production}} first increases and then decreases. When the number <b>of</b> <b>wells</b> is the same, the initial production increases rapidly, and after reaching the peak value, the production is slowly reduced. This makes the cumulative production increase in the early stage. When the number <b>of</b> <b>wells</b> exceeds the number <b>of</b> reasonable production <b>wells,</b> the cumulative output gradually becomes flat. Therefore, there is a reasonable well pattern density (reasonable number <b>of</b> <b>wells)</b> {{in the development of}} the gas reservoir. When exceeding the reasonable number <b>of</b> <b>wells,</b> the cumulative production tends to be stable and the economic benefits reduce.|$|R

5|$|Even {{before the}} Hanford Site {{started up the}} B Reactor, {{the first of its}} three reactors, on September 15, 1944, Wheeler had been {{concerned}} that some nuclear fission products {{might turn out to be}} nuclear poisons, the accumulation of which would impede the ongoing nuclear chain reaction by absorbing many of the thermal neutrons that were needed to continue a chain reaction. In an April 1942 report, he predicted that this would reduce the reactivity by less than one percent so long as no fission product had a neutron capture cross section of more than 100,000 barns. After the reactor unexpectedly shut down, and then just as unexpectedly restarted about fifteen hours later, he suspected iodine-135, with a half life of 6.6 hours, and its daughter product, xenon-135, which has a half life of 9.2 hours. Xenon-135 turned out to have a neutron capture cross-section <b>of</b> <b>well</b> over 2 million barns. The problem was corrected by adding additional fuel rods to burn out the poison.|$|E
5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark <b>of</b> <b>well</b> made fried chicken.|$|E

5|$|In June 1627, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham led an {{expedition}} to the island of Île de Ré to support the Huguenots besieged in La Rochelle by King Louis XIII of France.

Since public opinion in England (particularly among extreme Protestants) supported the Huguenots, a number <b>of</b> <b>well</b> connected gentry came forward. The volunteers to join Buckingham included Temple, his elder brother John {{and other members of}} his family. The expedition to the Isle of Ré, was a disaster and altogether, Buckingham lost more than 5,000 men in the campaign out of a force of 7,000. Among those who died was Temple's brother.|$|E

5|$|Mounted on a {{large scale}} under American command and {{involving}} nearly 15,000 troops, Paddington failed to result in significant contact, in spite of the employment <b>of</b> <b>well</b> co-ordinated search techniques and blocking forces. A large number of Viet Cong camps, bunkers and storage areas were however uncovered and destroyed, resulting in significant disruption to the communist logistic system. Under the overall command of Major General George G. O'Connor, commander US 9th Infantry Division, allied forces for Operation Paddington included the US 1st Brigade, 9th Infantry Division, the 2nd Battalion, US 47th Infantry Regiment (Mechanised), the US 11th Armoured Cavalry Regiment, Task Force B Marine Corps (RVN) and the 1st Australian Task Force, as well as various supporting arms including two artillery batteries and more than a thousand armoured vehicles and helicopters. Viet Cong casualties included 92 killed, including 31 by 1 ATF for the loss of one Australian killed and another wounded. Nonetheless, the results were disappointing for the Australians, and the Viet Cong continued to elude them.|$|E
