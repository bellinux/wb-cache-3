5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{is a small}} bird <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> with short, broad {{wings and}} a long tail, both adaptations to manoeuvring through trees. Females can be up to 25% larger than males and weigh up to twice as much. Marked size difference in this direction is unusual in higher vertebrates but typical in birds <b>of</b> <b>prey,</b> and most marked in birds <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> which hunt birds.|$|E

5|$|Krell's Klingon battlecruiser and two Birds <b>of</b> <b>Prey</b> {{arrive in}} orbit and Krell orders the ships {{to destroy the}} colony. Enterprise {{attempts}} to intervene but is engaged by the Birds <b>of</b> <b>Prey.</b> Columbia arrives and joins combat with the two Birds <b>of</b> <b>Prey,</b> while Enterprise impedes the battlecruiser. Meanwhile, Phlox infects a restrained Archer, as he needs human antibodies for the cure. Antaak then transports a canister of the virus onto the battlecruiser which infects the crew, including Krell. Needing the cure from Phlox, Krell stands down the attack and the Klingon High Council soon agrees to distribute the cure throughout the Empire. Tucker then agrees to remain onboard temporarily to assist with repairs.|$|E

5|$|A test in 1997 {{showed that}} P. fimbriata′s {{preferences}} for different types <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> {{are in the}} order: web spiders; jumping spiders; and insects. These preferences apply to both live prey and motionless lures, and to P. fimbriata specimens without prey for 7days ("well-fed") and without prey for 14days ("starved"). P. fimbriata specimens without prey for 21days ("extra-starved") showed no preference for different types <b>of</b> <b>prey.</b> The test included as prey several species of web spiders and jumping spiders, and {{the selection of the}} prey species showed no evidence of affecting the results.

5|$|A {{theory for}} the {{evolution}} of aposematism posits that it arises by reciprocal selection between predators and prey, where distinctive features in prey, which could be visual or chemical, are selected by non-discriminating predators, and where, concurrently, avoidance of distinctive prey is selected by predators. Concurrent reciprocal selection (CRS) may entail learning by predators or it may give rise to unlearned avoidances by them. Aposematism arising by CRS operates without special conditions of the gregariousness or the relatedness <b>of</b> <b>prey,</b> and it is not contingent upon predator sampling <b>of</b> <b>prey</b> to learn that aposematic cues are associated with unpalatability or other unprofitable features.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its small}} size, the least weasel is a fierce hunter, capable {{of killing a}} rabbit five to ten times its own weight. Although they are {{commonly}} taken, the rabbits are usually young specimens, and become an important food source during the spring, when small rodents are scarce and rabbit kits are plentiful. Male least weasels take {{a higher proportion of}} rabbits than females, as well as an overall greater variety <b>of</b> <b>prey.</b> This is linked to the fact that being larger, and having vaster territorial ranges than females, males have more opportunities to hunt a greater diversity <b>of</b> <b>prey.</b>|$|E
