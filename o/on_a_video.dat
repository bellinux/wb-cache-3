5|$|Cerny and Flanagan first collaborated <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> game {{based on}} Michael Jackson's Thriller. The project was {{canceled}} {{and the two}} began working on an idea of Cerny's that eventually became Marble Madness. Development lasted 10months. Following the North American video game crash of 1983, video game development within Atari focused on providing a distinctive experience {{through the use of}} a unique control system and by emphasizing a simultaneous two-player mode. Cerny designed Marble Madness in accordance with these company goals. He was first inspired by miniature golf and captivated by the idea that a play field's contours influenced the ball's path. Cerny began testing various ideas using Atari's digital art system. After deciding to use an isometric grid, Cerny began developing the game's concept. His initial idea involved hitting a ball in a way similar to miniature golf, but Atari was unenthusiastic. Cerny next thought of racing games and planned for races on long tracks against an opponent. Technology limitations at the time were unable to handle the in-game physics necessary for the idea, and Cerny switched the game's objective to a race against time.|$|E

5|$|F-Zero is {{a futuristic}} racing video game {{franchise}} originally created by Nintendo EAD {{and has been}} continually published by Nintendo although the company has let outside development houses work on some installments. The series premiered in Japan on November 21, 1990, with , which later was released in the North American (August 1991) and PAL (1992) regions. An original installment has appeared on nearly every succeeding Nintendo video game console and handheld {{with the exception of}} the Game Boy Color, Wii, and Nintendo DS. Excluding Japan, the series usually has landed <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> game system once in its lifetime. F-Zero: GP Legend marks the first time the franchise has hit a gaming system twice in its lifetime in the United States. Currently the series includes eight released video games, a television series, and video game soundtracks released on audio CDs. F-Zero and F-Zero X were re-released for the Virtual Console service through software emulation.|$|E
5|$|Ferris offers {{himself in}} {{exchange}} to Aisha's kidnappers, and {{is brought to}} the middle of the desert, with Hoffman watching everything via a surveillance drone. Ferris is surrounded by a group of SUVs, which circle him to create an obscuring dust cloud before picking him up. The dust cloud blocks Hoffman's view, so that he cannot determine which of the SUVs, now headed in different directions, is carrying Ferris. Ferris is taken across the border to Syria where he is to be interrogated by Al-Saleem. When Ferris asks Al-Saleem about Aisha, he is told that someone has lied to him and that he has been double-crossed. Ferris tells Al-Saleem that there is an infiltrator (Karami) in his organization who works for Ferris, and that, by association, Al-Saleem works for Ferris. Al-Saleem does not believe Ferris, beats him, turns <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> camera and orders his execution. Salaam and his agents arrive at the last moment, saving Ferris' life. Al-Saleem is shown arrested in his own SUV by Marwan Se-Kia, Hani Salaam's security officer.|$|E
5|$|The safest way to {{view the}} Sun's disk is by {{indirect}} projection. This {{can be done by}} projecting an image of the disk onto a white piece of paper or card using a pair of binoculars (with one of the lenses covered), a telescope, or another piece of cardboard with a small hole in it (about 1mm diameter), often called a pinhole camera. The projected image of the Sun can then be safely viewed; this technique can be used to observe sunspots, as well as eclipses. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that no one looks through the projector (telescope, pinhole, etc.) directly. Viewing the Sun's disk <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> display screen (provided by a video camera or digital camera) is safe, although the camera itself may be damaged by direct exposure to the Sun. The optical viewfinders provided with some video and digital cameras are not safe. Securely mounting #14 welder's glass in front of the lens and viewfinder protects the equipment and makes viewing possible. Professional workmanship is essential because of the dire consequences any gaps or detaching mountings will have. In the partial eclipse path, one {{will not be able to}} see the corona or nearly complete darkening of the sky, however, depending on how much of the Sun's disk is obscured, some darkening may be noticeable. If three-quarters or more of the sun is obscured, then an effect can be observed by which the daylight appears to be dim, as if the sky were overcast, yet objects still cast sharp shadows.|$|E

5|$|In May 1972, Nutting Associates chief {{engineer}} Nolan Bushnell, {{designer of the}} first commercial arcade video game, Computer Space, saw {{a demonstration of the}} Odyssey at a dealership. Inspired, when he quit Nutting to start his own company, Atari, he assigned Allan Alcorn to create a cheap ping pong arcade game as a training exercise, though he did not tell Alcorn that it was for training nor that the idea was based on the Odyssey Table Tennis game. Alcorn soon developed Pong, which Bushnell recognized as a potential hit, and it became the company's first game. Pong was very successful, and in turn helped drive sales of the Odyssey; Baer once noted that customers bought the console because of Table Tennis, in turn because of Pong, and joked that they may as well have stopped designing games after that game card. In 1974, however, Magnavox sued Atari along with several competitors including Nutting, Allied Leisure, Bally Midway, and Williams Electronics for infringing on Baer's patents for video games played on a television screen. Baer has stated that the lawsuits were not filed right away because Magnavox and Sanders needed to wait until they could expect to be awarded more money than it would cost to pursue the suits. The root of the conflict was a pair of patents by Baer—one which described how the Odyssey showed player-controlled objects, or dots, <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> monitor and described a number of games that could be played with the system, and an earlier one that went into detail about how the Odyssey used that system to have two dots collide with each other and have one bounce off, specifically using a game of ping pong as an example.|$|E

25|$|A {{video game}} is an {{electronic}} game that involves interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> device {{such as a}} TV screen or computer monitor. The word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.|$|E
25|$|Laparoscopic {{surgery is}} {{performed}} using several small incisions, or ports: one to insert a surgical telescope connected to a video camera, and others to permit access of specialized operating instruments. The surgeon views the operation <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> screen. Laparoscopy is also called limited access surgery, reflecting the limitation on handling and feeling tissues and also the limited resolution and two-dimensionality of the video image. With experience, a skilled laparoscopic surgeon can perform most procedures as expeditiously as with an open incision—with the option of using an incision should the need arise.|$|E
25|$|At low refresh rates (60Hz and below), the {{periodic}} scanning {{of the display}} may produce a flicker that some people perceive more easily than others, especially when viewed with peripheral vision. Flicker is commonly associated with CRT as most televisions run at 50Hz (PAL) or 60Hz (NTSC), {{although there are some}} 100Hz PAL televisions that are flicker-free. Typically only low-end monitors run at such low frequencies, with most computer monitors supporting at least 75Hz and high-end monitors capable of 100Hz or more to eliminate any perception of flicker. Non-computer CRTs or CRT for sonar or radar may have long persistence phosphor and are thus flicker free. If the persistence is too long <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> display, moving images will be blurred.|$|E

25|$|Windows Explorer also {{contains}} modifications in the visualization of files on a computer. A new addition to Windows Explorer is the Details pane, which displays metadata and {{information relating to}} the currently selected file or folder. Windows Vista introduces a newer IThumbnailProvider interface that shows thumbnails in the Details pane {{as well as in}} large icon views. Furthermore, different imagery is overlaid on thumbnails to give more information about the file, such as a picture frame around the thumbnail of an image file, or a filmstrip <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> file. Thumbnails can be zoomed on. The preview panel allows you to see thumbnails of all sorts of files and view the contents of documents, similar to the way you can preview email messages in Outlook, without opening the files. There's a new intelligent algorithm for creation of Video thumbnails, which chooses a random frame inside the video and ensures the thumbnail is not black (XP showed the first frame, it was usually black).|$|E
25|$|The {{input device}} used for games, the game controller, varies across platforms. Common {{controllers}} include gamepads, joysticks, mouse devices, keyboards, the touchscreens of mobile devices, and buttons, or even, with the Kinect sensor, a person's hands and body. Players typically view the game <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> screen or television or computer monitor, or sometimes on virtual reality head-mounted display goggles. There are often game sound effects, music and, in the 2010s, voice actor lines which come from loudspeakers or headphones. Some {{games in the}} 2000s include haptic, vibration-creating effects, force feedback peripherals and virtual reality headsets. In the 2010s, the video game industry is of increasing commercial importance, with growth driven particularly by the emerging Asian markets and mobile games, which are played on smartphones. As of 2015, video games generated sales of USD 74 billion annually worldwide, and were the third-largest segment in the U.S. entertainment market, behind broadcast and cable TV.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 2015, the {{university}} was given $4 million from the estate of Robert Morin, {{who had been a}} librarian at the university for almost 50 years. Having lived a frugal and secluded life, he allowed for his life's savings to be given to the university without restraint. In 2016, the news that the university was spending $1 million on a new video screen for the football stadium provoked criticism, on and off-campus, with critics noting that the difference between that amount and the $100,000 the university transferred to the library was jarring. A story on Deadspin connected the money for the video screen to the amount of money spent on football and other sports at UNH, arguing that UNH had turned a small hobby of Morin's, watching football during the last months of his life, into an excuse to spend a quarter of his gift <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>video</b> screen.|$|E
