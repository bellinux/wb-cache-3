During the night of 21 February 1944, Alabamas 5-inch guns were firing upon Japanese aircraft in the area. The ship turned {{in the direction of the}} Japanese aircraft in order to better engage them, but the rearmost turret was masked behind the amidships mount. The gunner in the rearmost turret accidentally overrode the safety mechanism that prevented the gun from firing in that circumstance, and when the gun was fired, it hit the 5-inch turret in front of it.

Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated {{there was a real}} concern. In response, the areas of the horizontal stabilizer were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual <b>override</b> <b>switch</b> to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E

50|$|Modern RTUs {{are usually}} capable of {{executing}} simple programs autonomously without involving the host computers of the DCS or SCADA system to simplify deployment {{and to provide}} redundancy for safety reasons. An RTU in a modern water management system will typically have code to modify its behavior when physical <b>override</b> <b>switches</b> on the RTU are toggled during maintenance by maintenance personnel. This is done for safety reasons; a miscommunication between the system operators and the maintenance personnel could cause system operators to mistakenly enable power to a water pump when it is being replaced, for example.|$|R

50|$|On September 24, the Atlas was {{prepared}} for a planned 12-minute PFRT (Pre-Flight Readiness Test). The satellite {{was not on the}} launch vehicle, the third stage was a dummy, and the second stage was unfueled. After 2.5 seconds of engine operation, a fire erupted in the Atlas's thrust section. Fed by leaking liquid oxygen, it proved impossible to put out with pad extinguishers and soon a huge inferno was raging on LC-12. Thirty-seven seconds after the fire began, the Atlas toppled over in a massive fireball, the biggest explosion seen at Cape Canaveral up to that point. The pad was severely damaged, with both umbilical towers totally destroyed, the concrete launch stand caved in, and the service tower knocked over. It would take months of repairs to get it back online. The final explosion was believed {{to be the result of}} loss of tank pressure. Engine shutdown caused the propellant valves to snap shut, causing overpressurization of the propellant tanks. Ground operators in the blockhouse flipped manual <b>override</b> <b>switches</b> to lower RP-1 pressure and increase LOX pressure, but the missile did not respond, possibly due to fire-induced damage to the control wiring on the pad. The pneumatic control system automatically threw open the LOX boil-off valve to vent tank pressure, which apparently continued until the tanks lost support pressure to the point where their structural integrity failed. At around 35 seconds, the intermediate bulkhead collapsed, causing the LOX to fall into the RP-1 tank and mix. The propellants turned into a gel that detonated with the force of 20,000 pounds (9070 kg) of TNT and resulted in an extremely powerful explosion that caused extensive pad damage.|$|R
30|$|In the {{specific}} example, we could easily {{resolve the problem}} because the guard time is calculated {{taking into account the}} <b>switch</b> time. By <b>overriding</b> the <b>switch</b> time constant with a value of zero for the simulation, this specific instance of the busy-waiting problem was resolved. There are also several other points in the radio switching code where busy-waiting loops are used, but the impact of those loops is much smaller as their waiting time is in the order of 0.1 [*]msec. Furthermore, not all protocols are impacted by the demonstrated off-to-receive switch problem. If the timing for events after the switch is done relative to the completion of the switch, for example, by waiting until a certain number of bytes have been read from the radio, the time difference is effectively zero as well.|$|R
5000|$|Glenn was now {{preparing}} for reentry. Retaining the retro package meant {{he would have}} to retract the periscope manually. He would also have to activate the 0.05-g sequence by pushing the <b>override</b> <b>switch.</b> Friendship 7 neared the California coast. It had been four hours and 33 minutes since launch. The spacecraft was maneuvered into retrofire attitude and the first retrorocket fired. [...] "Roger. Retros are firing. ... Are they ever. It feels like I'm going back toward Hawaii.", Glenn radioed. The second and then the third retros fired at five-second intervals. The spacecraft attitude was steady during retrofire. Six minutes after retrofire; Glenn maneuvered the spacecraft into a 14-degree nose up, pitch attitude for reentry.|$|E

40|$|As {{a result}} of the {{technological}} advances and increasing focus on energy efficient buildings, simple forms of building automation including automatic motorized blinds systems found their ways into today's office environments. In a five-month field study, qualitative and quantitative methods were used to investigate how office workers in 40 offices experience and use automatically controlled exterior venetian blinds with options for manual <b>override</b> and <b>switching</b> off the automatic mode. In total, 3433 blinds adjustments (average of 0. 86 per office per day) were recorded, of which 73. 6 % was initiated by the user. Significant correlations between weather parameters and blind adjustments were found, including sunshine duration and user-triggered lowering of blinds (R= 0. 354), cloud cover and user-triggered lowering of the blinds (R=- 0. 281), and outside temperature and user-triggered raising of blinds (R=- 0. 266). Four blinds usage profiles were identified and the underlying motivations for the different users were described. In the majority of offices, the automatic mode was switched off...|$|R
40|$|The Yersinia enterocolitica YtxR {{protein is}} a LysR-type {{transcriptional}} regulator that induces {{expression of the}} ytxAB locus, which encodes a putative ADP-ribosylating toxin. The ytxR and ytxAB genes are not closely linked in the Y. enterocolitica chromosome, and whereas ytxR is present in all sequenced Yersinia spp., the ytxAB locus is not. These observations suggested {{that there might be}} other YtxR-regulon members besides ytxAB and prompted us to investigate coregulated genes and gene products by using transcriptional and proteomic approaches. Microarray and reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that YtxR strongly activates expression of the yts 2 locus, which encodes a putative type 2 secretion system, as well as several uncharacterized genes predicted to encode extracytoplasmic proteins. Strikingly, we also discovered that under Ysc-Yop type 3 secretion system-inducing conditions, YtxR prevented the appearance of Yop proteins in the culture supernatant. Microarray and lacZ operon fusion analysis showed that this was due to specific repression of ysc-yop gene expression. YtxR was also able to repress VirF-dependent Φ(yopE-lacZ) and Φ(yopH-lacZ) expression in a strain lacking the virulence plasmid, which suggested a direct repression mechanism. This was supported by DNase I footprinting, which showed that YtxR interacted with the yopE and yopH control regions. Therefore, YtxR is a newly identified regulator of the ysc-yop genes that can act as an <b>overriding</b> off <b>switch</b> for this critical virulence system...|$|R
2500|$|In [...] "Balance of Power" [...] (1988), Holly {{reveals that}} reason Rimmer was brought {{back as a}} {{hologram}} was because, in Holly's judgment, Rimmer was the best person to keep Lister sane because the two had shared fourteen million words between each other, making Rimmer the crew member with which Lister had the most interaction; in Holly's judgment, {{the fact that their}} interactions were almost entirely antagonistic was irrelevant. Lister later asks Rimmer where the disc which contains Navigation Officer Kristine Kochanski's (C P Grogan) hologram has been hidden so that Lister could go on a date with her, but Rimmer refuses to switch his own disc off to bring back Kochanski for an evening due to the risk that Lister might not turn Rimmer's hologram on again. Holly has the ability to <b>override</b> Rimmer and <b>switch</b> his disc off but cannot do so because Rimmer outranks Lister and he is programmed to prioritise the former's orders over the latter's.|$|R

NASCAR vice-president of competition Robin Pemberton stated after the race that the organization [...] "were scanning cars and spotters, and there's some of us in the tower that only heard it after the teams were talking about it because we were looking at other things around the racetrack". He added that the situation was where NASCAR “learn a lot of lessons, and when we learn a lesson like this we'll go in and further investigate some things" [...] and that [...] "there's probably some things that we needed to do to better secure that area where the manual override is on the lights".|$|E

50|$|Three Mariner probes were {{constructed}} for the mission, with two intended to fly and {{one as a}} spare {{in the event of}} a mission failure. The spacecraft were shipped to Cape Canaveral with their Atlas-Centaur boosters in December 1968 - January 1969 to begin pre-launch checkouts and testing. On February 14, Mariner 6 was undergoing a simulated countdown on LC-36A, electrical power running, but no propellant loaded in the booster. During the test run, an electrical relay in the Atlas malfunctioned and opened two valves in the pneumatic system which allowed helium pressure gas to escape from the booster's balloon skin. The Atlas began to crumple over, however two pad technicians quickly activated a manual <b>override</b> <b>switch</b> to close the valves and pump helium back in. Although Mariner 6 and its Centaur stage had been saved, the Atlas had sustained structural damage and could not be reused, so they were removed from the booster and placed atop Mariner 7's launch vehicle on the adjacent LC-36B, while a different Atlas was used for Mariner 7. NASA awarded the quick-thinking technicians, Bill McClure and Jack Beverlin, an Exceptional Medal of Bravery for their courage in risking being crushed underneath the 124-foot rocket. In 2014, a recently discovered escarpment on Mars was named the McClure-Beverlin Ridge in honor of the pair, who had since passed on.|$|E
5000|$|The {{automatic}} transmission {{also has the}} ability to change the shift points, and hold the gears longer when the engine is operating at higher RPMs. This is achieved by pressing the accelerator pedal quickly, which causes an indicator light marked as [...] "Power" [...] at the bottom center of the instrument cluster to light up. The European and Australian version came equipped with a center console installed <b>override</b> <b>switch</b> labeled [...] "AT Econo" [...] which instructed the computer to utilize the [...] "Power" [...] mode, and remain so until the switch was reset to [...] "Econo" [...] mode. The [...] "Power" [...] mode was also available for engine braking, causing the transmission to downshift 500 rpm earlier than in [...] "normal" [...] mode. For 1991, the [...] "Manual" [...] button on the gearshift was replaced by a [...] "Econo" [...] switch on the gearshift, and the console mounted button was changed from [...] "AT Econo" [...] to [...] "Manual", so that the transmission was always in [...] "Econo" [...] mode until the gearshift mounted switch was disengaged. Unlike the USA and Japanese version, which went into [...] "Power" [...] mode only when the accelerator was pushed rapidly, the [...] "Power" [...] mode on the European and Australian version was activated by either console or gearshift installed switches.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Mitsubishi {{equipped}} the Lancer Evolution VII {{with the}} AYC system, Mitsubishi's own Sports ABS and a newly developed Active Center Differential (ACD), which used an electronically controlled variable multi-plate clutch. The ACD has a differential limiting capacity three {{times greater than}} that of the viscous coupling-type differential used to date. Also, the ACD's ability to tailor slippage for different driving conditions enabled the levels of steering response and traction control not possible with a viscous coupling differential. In addition, a three-way manual <b>override</b> <b>switch</b> enables the driver to select tarmac, gravel or snow modes to suit his preferences or driving conditions. The ACD also frees the differential on operation of the hand brake, allowing the driver to make more effective use of side brake turns in rallies and gymkhanas. On the Evolution VII, control of the ACD and AYC systems is integrated {{for the very first time}} (integrated management of these systems is the core of Mitsubishi's AWC philosophy). In the integrated system, ACD feedback and feedforward information is transmitted to the AYC control system using parameters in such a way that the larger the ACD differential limiting force is, the larger the yaw moment generated by the AYC system. This integrated control operates so that, for example when accelerating out of a corner, the ACD enhances traction and the AYC enhances steering response and cornering performance, improving acceleration and handling more than the ACD and AYC systems would if they were operating independently. By doing so, the Lancer Evolution VII heralded the birth of Mitsubishi’s AWC technology.|$|E

40|$|A {{remote control}} {{security}} apparatus includes a lock element movable between {{locked and unlocked}} positions by an electrically actuated power device. The operator is provided with a portable transmitter adapted to generate light which is interrupted at a predetermined frequency so as to produce an encoded light signal. This signal is detected by a light transceiver which generates an independent signal at the same predetermined frequency and which compares the frequencies of the detected signal and independent signal. If these frequencies are substantially the same, the transceiver actuates the power means to move the lock element to its unlocked position. The security apparatus may be advantageously installed as a door lock, in which case a lock element receiving member is secured to the door. The signal detector is positioned at the exterior {{side of the door}} for receiving encoded signals from the transmitter and an <b>override</b> <b>switch</b> may be positioned at an interior side of the door for opening the lock without a transmitter. A contact switch is disclosed which maintains the lock element in the unlocked position whenever the door is open...|$|E
40|$|Ionospheric {{absorption}} is {{a controlling}} factor in accurate prediction of medium to high frequency signal levels that are passing through ionosphere. Particularly at high latitudes ionospheric storms {{are the main}} problem, causing unreliable communication. Sometimes these storms can lead HF radio signals to "polar blackouts" (reducing the signal in-time by 20 % or more) or they can even be completely absorbed by ionosphere. [Ware and Owren, 1958] This project report presents the design, construction and testing of a device {{that is used to}} measure ionospheric cosmic noise absorption, which is called riometer. During the project development different methods of filter design (all-pole and coupled capacitor resonator filters), impedance matching (L, pi and capacitor tapped matching) and signal attenuation calculation (impedance mismatch, pi attenuator and potential divider) are showed and described. The need for new riometer design had arisen, because some discrete components used in previous riometer designs are obsolete [LIS Riometers] and therefore the new riometers cannot be made based on the old designs, so the new design had to be invented. This new riometer design also includes the new feature of controlling the switching between antenna and calibration using the computer control inputs and mechanical <b>override</b> <b>switch,</b> thus providing higher system flexibility.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to {{experimentally}} determine the air flow through the cooling module (air-conditioning condenser plus engine radiator) of a Ford Windstar minivan when the van is operated {{at a fraction of}} a vehicle length behind a lead van. Pressures and temperatures are measured across the cooling module while the vans are in operation, and a standard calibration relates the pressure drop to the flow velocity through the cooling module. The Windstars are connected in tandem and driven on a test track at spacings of 0. 22, 0. 28, 0. 38, 0. 62, 0. 88, and 1. 0, expressed as fractions of the Windstar length. For the purposes of the test, an <b>override</b> <b>switch</b> is installed to allow the close-following van to be operated either with both cooling fans remaining on or with both fans disabled. Air flow is expressed either as a volume flow, in cubic meters per second, or as the fraction of the flow for a van operating in isolation at the same forward speed. With both fans disabled, the air flow is approximately twenty per cent of the isolation value at the shortest spacing, and increases to about sixty per cent at a spacing of one vehicle length. With both fans operating, the air flow is approximately fifty per cent of the isolation value at the shortest separation, and increases to about seventy per cent at one vehicle length separation. These represent substantial decreases in air flow, and will result in a diminished operating envelope for the vehicle in close-following.

40|$|Modern office {{buildings}} are often equipped with automatic systems that {{turn on the}} lights if somebody enters a room and turn them off when everybody has left the room. This ensures that users do not leave the lights on during the night and thus avoids wasting energy. For cost reasons, most of these installations do not include any manual user control any more, thereby exposing the user to an autonomously operating, automated lighting system. This can be quite annoying, not only because it does not allow a user to express any preferences, but also because energy is wasted in a forced manner, especially to energy-concerned users who would e. g. like to turn off the lights when the office is illuminated by bright daylight. In this technical note, we investigate the effect of giving back control of the lighting system to the users, focusing on the energy consumption. This was done in 16 offices in HTC 34. In some of these offices the lights were replaced with ones that are dimmed automatically under day lighting conditions. After having used the system for one year, it indeed showed that users deliberately contribute significantly to energy efficient lighting: the savings in energy consumption compared to the original fully automatic system was over 30 % for the standard non-dimmable lighting and over 50 % for the dimmable lighting. We propose to install a manual <b>override</b> <b>switch</b> in those rooms that receive enough natural light and that currently have a fully presence-based automatic system installed. The estimated payback period is about four years. It is not necessary to replace the lights themselves: although the use of dimmable lights has shown even greater savings, it has a much longer payback time because of the high installation costs. Apart from a financial incentive, installing these switches is beneficial for the “green” image of the campus and empowers people to contribute to this...|$|E
