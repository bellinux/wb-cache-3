25|$|There {{are some}} {{advantages}} of the projective space compared with affine space (e.g., Pn(R) vs. An(R)).

(Very) ample line bundles are designed to tackle this question.|$|E

25|$|The {{species was}} also {{independently}} renamed three times after Forsskål's description, the first coming from Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg, who named the species Caranx immaculatus, {{although he did}} not accurately publish the name, leading Georges Cuvier to rename the fish as Caranx auroguttatus in 1833, which was later transferred to Carangoides. In 1871, Carl Benjamin Klunzinger once again proposed a new subspecies (<b>or</b> <b>variety)</b> name for the fish, Caranx fulvoguttatus var. flava. All names except Carangoides bajad are considered to be junior synonyms under the ICZN rules, and are rendered invalid and not used.|$|E

25|$|Status Planning {{suggests}} that a particular language <b>or</b> <b>variety</b> may be chosen for specific purposes and given official status. This {{may result in a}} language policy which is a product of language planning, and can be comprehended within the discourse of language politics and society, or the more informal but powerful political and social aspects of language planning. In this view, one can argue that language status planning issues are related to political issues as status planning focuses on legislative decisions that affect the reallocation of language functions. Language status can also mean the position or standing of a language vis-à-vis other languages.|$|E
25|$|The Povoan accent {{known as}} Falar poveiro (Povoan speech), Sotaque poveiro (Povoan accent) or simply Poveiro, {{occasionally}} erroneously called caxineiro, is a sub-dialect <b>or</b> <b>variety</b> of the Portuguese dialect known by linguists as Interâmnico and, popularly, as Nortenho or Northern Portuguese, {{which is the}} oldest dialect of the Portuguese language and it is spoken in Coastal Northern Portugal from Viana do Castelo to Porto and, inland, it reaches Braga. The region is {{the birthplace of the}} Portuguese language. There are two subdialects: Porto-Póvoa and Braga-Viana, each of these subdialects is further divided into Porto, Póvoa, Braga, and Viana. The Póvoa one is the transitional dialect between the speeches of Braga and Porto.|$|E
25|$|In {{artificial}} selection {{the new breed}} <b>or</b> <b>variety</b> that emerges is the one with random mutations attractive to humans, while in natural selection the surviving species is the one with random mutations useful to it in its non-human environment. In both natural and {{artificial selection}} the variations {{are a result of}} random mutations, and the underlying genetic processes are essentially the same. Darwin carefully observed the outcomes of artificial selection in animals and plants to form many of his arguments in support of natural selection. Much of his book On the Origin of Species was based on these observations of the many varieties of domestic pigeons arising from artificial selection. Darwin proposed that if humans could achieve dramatic changes in domestic animals in short periods, then natural selection, given millions of years, could produce the differences seen in living things today.|$|E

25|$|Inspired by {{the work}} ethic of fellow comedian George Carlin, who had {{committed}} to dropping all of his existing material and starting over every year, In June 2006, C.K. starred in and wrote Lucky Louie, a sitcom he created. The series premiered on HBO and was videotaped {{in front of a}} studio audience; it was HBO's first series in that format. Lucky Louie is described as a bluntly realistic portrayal of family life. HBO canceled the series after its first season. He appeared in three films in 2008: Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins, Diminished Capacity, and Role Models. C.K. launched his first hour-long special, Shameless, in 2007, which aired on HBO and was later released on DVD. In March 2008, he recorded a second hour-long special, Chewed Up, which premiered on Showtime Network on October 4, 2008, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy <b>or</b> <b>Variety</b> Special.|$|E
500|$|Three {{species of}} maple trees are {{predominantly}} {{used to produce}} maple syrup: the sugar maple (Acer saccharum), the black maple (A. nigrum), and the red maple (A. rubrum), {{because of the high}} sugar content (roughly two to five percent) in the sap of these species. The black maple is included as a subspecies <b>or</b> <b>variety</b> in a more broadly viewed concept of A. saccharum, the sugar maple, by some botanists. [...] Of these, the red maple has a shorter season because it buds earlier than sugar and black maples, which alters the flavour of the sap.|$|E
