40|$|A {{process has}} been {{developed}} at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) {{for the removal of}} metals and radionuclides from contaminated materials, soils, and waste sites. In this process, citric acid, a naturally occurring <b>organic</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agent,</b> is used to extract metals such as Ba, Cd, Cr, Ni, Zn, and radionuclides Co, Sr, Th, and U from solid wastes by formation of water soluble, metal-citrate complexes.

The extract containing radionuclide/metal complex is then subjected to microbiological degradation followed by photochemical degradation under aerobic conditions. Several metal citrate complexes are biodegraded, and the metals are recovered in a concentrated form with the bacterial biomass. Uranium forms binuclear complex with citric acid and is not biodegraded. The supernatant containing uranium citrate complex is separated and upon exposure to light, undergoes rapid degradation resulting in the formation of an insoluble, stable polymeric form of uranium.

Extractable Zn from soil receiving Zn fertilizer increased rapidly within the first day of incubation, and decreased uniformly throughout the following 84 -days. Extractable P from samples treated with P fertilizer showed the same pattern up to 54 days but increased thereafter indicating the release of a portion of the fixed P with elapsed time. Application of ZnSO 4. 7 H 20 decreased Fe and Cu and increased that of Mn. In contrast, addition of KH 2 PO 4, increased extractable Fe and Mn, but decreased extractable Cu.

Some manufacturing process use industrial by-products as a Zn source while others use highly refined ZnSO 4. Many claims are made in the market place regarding the agronomic effectiveness of these organic, inorganic and chelated Zn sources, all of which are based upon the total Zn content of the fertilizer. Water solubility has not been of concern since many products have traditionally been highly water soluble. However, with the integration of various industrial by-products into the manufacturing streams, questions arise as the their agronomic effectiveness. The objectives of these studies were to determine the relationship between water solubility, relative availability coefficient (RAC) and agronomic effectiveness of some "typical" Zn fertilizers (organic and inorganic). The water solubility of the Zn sources ranged from 0. 1 to 99 %. The RAC is defined as the slope of the response curve for Zn uptake or biomass production divided by the slope of the response curve of the most effective Zn source over a range of Zn rates. The RAC of our Zn sources ranged from 14 to 100 % for biomass production and- 12 to 100 % for Zn uptake. There was highly significant positive correlation between water solubility, RAC, biomass production and Zn uptake by the plant. When comparing all sources, water solubility was the primary factor governing the performance of Zn fertilizers. Reacting Zn with an <b>organic</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agent</b> does not guarantee the resulting fertilizer will perform like a true chelate and have high plant availability.

Another problem in using bulk YBCO {{is the absence of}} texture, biaxial texture is necessary to assure the quality of the superconductor. A solution to both problems is presented by the coated conductor structure. This structure consists of a flexible metallic tape (Ni- 5 at%W) coated with multiple buffer layers (CeO 2, La 2 Zr 2 O 7) and a superconducting layer (YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7). In contrast to the production of many coated conductors in the international research community, a cheaper non-vacuum technique, namely the sol-gel method is used in this work. Every layer is produced starting from an aqueous precursor solution containing the corresponding metal acetates and an <b>organic</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agent,</b> such as triethanolamine. The acidity of the solution was adjusted by adding ammonium hydroxide order to obtain a clear and stable gel without precipitation. Potentiometric titrations allowed us to determine the complexation behaviour of the metalions in the gel. Using the SUPERQUAD and EQUIL software, pH-distribution curves could be generated. Through dip-coating, thin films were deposited on the substrate. At low temperatures (60 °C) the solution is transformed into an amorphous gel. The crystalline and biaxially textured buffer layers are formed during a heat treatment at elevated temperatures (1000 °C) under inert atmosphere (Ar- 5 %H 2). The superconducting film was deposited on a cleaned SrTiO 3 substrate and heat treated at temperatures of 815 °C under nitrogen with 200 ppm oxygen. Characterisation of the morphology and microstructure of the thin films were carried out using XRD, pole figures, SEM, AFM and TEM.

The surface characteristics of corrensite, a mixed chlorite/smectite clay mineral, have been studied. Zeta potential measurements and titration experiments suggest that the corrensite surface contains a mixture of permanent charge sites on the basal plane and SiOH and AlOH sites with a net pH-dependent charge {{at the edge of}} the clay platelets. Triple-layer model parameters were determined by the double extrapolation technique for use in chemical speciation calculations of adsorption reactions using the computer program HYDRAQL. Batch adsorption studies showed that corrensite is an effective adsorbent for uranyl. The pH-dependent adsorption behavior indicates that adsorption occurs at the edge sites. Adsorption studies were also conducted in the presence of competing cations and complexing ligands. The cations did not affect uranyl adsorption in the range studied. This observation lends support to the hypothesis that uranyl adsorption occurs at the edge sites. Uranyl adsorption was significantly hindered by carbonate. It is proposed that the formation of carbonate uranyl complexes inhibits uranyl adsorption and that only the carbonate-free species adsorb to the corrensite surface.

The effect of <b>organic</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agents</b> on scorodite stability, however, is largely unknown. The present study is a phenomenological investigation into the dissolution kinetics of scorodite in the presence of oxalic acid under varying conditions of pH, oxalic acid concentration and temperature. The effect of scorodite particle size was also investigated. The morphological changes accompanying the dissolution process were examined by SEM and TEM analyses. Dissolution curves were divided into a linear induction period and a post-induction period. Activation energies were determined. Complete dissolution data were fit to the Prout-Tompkins/Austin-Rickett model. Dissolution data are indicative of auto-accelerated processes. The rapid increase in dissolution rate following the induction period is believed to be associated with an increase in the effective surface area.

40|$|Characterising the {{geochemistry}} and speciation {{of major}} contaminant radionuclides {{is crucial in}} order to understand their behaviour and migration in <b>complex</b> environmental systems. <b>Organic</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agents</b> used in nuclear decontamination have been found to enhance migration of radionuclides at contaminated sites; however, the mechanisms of the interactions in complex environments are poorly understood. In this work, radionuclide speciation and sorption behaviour were investigated in order to identify interactions between four key radionuclides with different oxidation states (Cs(I) and Sr(II) as important fission products; Th(IV) and U(VI) as representative actinides), three anthropogenic <b>organic</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agents</b> with different denticities (EDTA, NTA and picolinic acid as common co-contaminants), and natural sand (as simple environmental solid phase). A UV spectrophotometric and an IC method were developed to monitor the behaviour of EDTA, NTA and picolinic acid in the later experiments. The optimised methods were simple, applied widely-available instrumentation and achieved the necessary analytical figures of merit to allow a compound specific determination over variable background levels of DOC and in the presence of natural cations, anions and radionuclides. The effect of the ligands on the solubility of the radionuclides was studied using a natural sand matrix and pure silica for comparison of anions, cations and organic carbon. In the silica system, the presence of EDTA, NTA and, to a lesser extent, picolinic acid, showed a clear net effect of increasing Th and U solubility. Conversely, in the sand system, the sorption of Th and U was kinetically controlled and radionuclide complexation by the ligands enhanced the rate of sorption, by a mechanism identified as metal exchange with matrix metals. Experiments in which excess EDTA, NTA and picolinic acid (40 – 100 fold excess) were pre-equilibrated with Th and U prior to contact with the sand, to allow a greater degree of radionuclide complex formation, resulted in enhanced rates of sorption. This confirmed that the radionuclide complexes interacted with the sand surface more readily than uncomplexed Th or U. Overall this shows that Th and U mobility would be lowered in this natural sand by the presence of organic co-contaminants. In contrast, the complexation of Sr with the <b>complexing</b> <b>agents</b> was rapid and the effect of the ligands was observed as a net increase on Sr solubility (EDTA, picolinic acid) or sorption (NTA). As expected, Cs did not interact with the ligands, and showed rapid sorption kinetics. Finally, ESI-MS was used to study competitive interactions in the aqueous Th-Mn-ligand ternary system. Quantification presented a challenge, however, the careful approach taken to determine the signal correction allowed the competitive interactions between Mn and Th for EDTA to be studied semi-quantitatively.

40|$|This project fits {{well within}} the overall {{objectives}} established by the Environmental Management and Science Program to promote long-term basic research that will provide the tools for more effective and lower cost remediation efforts at DOE sites where hazardous and radioactive wastes or contamination zones are present. In order to develop the necessary remediation technology it has been recognized that a fundamental understanding of the various chemical and physical factors associated with waste treatment and contaminant transport must be established. Some of the specific topics include waste pretreatment, volume reduction, immobilization, separation methods, the interactions of actinides and heavy metals with surfaces {{in the presence of}} organic residues and co-contaminants, contaminant transport in the environment, and long-term storage site assessment. This project has direct and potential application in all these areas. The interaction and partitioning of contaminant metals and radionuclides between solution and solid- surface phases is a fundamental issue for waste treatment and predicting contaminant transport in the environment. Many factors are involved in the functional relationships describing chemical reactivity and physical distribution of chemical species. These include modification of chemical behavior by the suite of chemical co-contaminants in a system. <b>Organic</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agents</b> are common components of waste mixtures and include both synthetic components specifically introduced as part of processing methods, and poorly characterized compounds that were introduced separately or evolved within the highly reactive wastes. Natural <b>organic</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agents</b> such as citric acid and siderophores are common in nature and represent factors that will further influence contaminant transport in soils and aquatic systems. Knowledge of the existence of a metal-organic complex cannot automatically be used to predict changes in solid-solution partitioning of the metal or the rates of changes in partitioning as a consequence of ligand or metal exchange. Formation of metal ion-ligand-oxide surface ternary complexes can enhance sorption in some cases while highly stable metal-organic complexes in solution will decrease sorption. The preference for these two cases depends on the relative chemical properties of each component as well as system parameters such as pH and ionic strength and the relative reaction rates. In general, there is a fundamental absence of the experimental observations needed to establish the trends needed for predictive modeling and technological developments. If the authors can understand both the equilibrium partitioning in these ternary systems (i. e., metal-ligand-solid) and the types of complexes that form as functions of a set of measurable parameters that characterize the system, the authors should significantly improve the ability to estimate the mass transport rates of contaminants and natural solutes in aquifers and water columns where organic ligands are significant species. The authors will also be better prepared to devise remediation strategies where introduction of organic ligands can bring about either mobilization of contaminants or enhanced retardation. The ligands are likely to prove useful in the direct treatment and remediation of contaminated sites (Francis and Dodge, 1992; Tuin and Tels, 1990) and can be chosen for their long term stability or their ability to degrade by natural biotic processes. ...|$|R
40|$|Adsorption of aqueous Pb(II) and Cu(II) on α-quartz was {{studied as}} a {{function}} of time, system surface area, and chemical speciation. Experimental systems contained sodium as a major cation, hydroxide, carbonate, and chloride as major anions, and covered the pH range 4 to 8. In some cases citrate and EDTA were added as representative <b>organic</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agents.</b> The adsorption equilibria were reached quickly, regardless of the system surface area. The positions of the adsorption equilibria were found to be strongly dependent on pH, ionic strength and concentration of citrate and EDTA. The addition of these non-adsorbing ligands resulted in a competition between chelation and adsorption. The experimental work also included the examination of the adsorption behavior of the doubly charged major cations Ca(II) and Mg(II) {{as a function}} of pH. The theoretical description of the experimental systems was obtained by means of chemical equilibrium-plus-adsorption computations using two adsorption models: one mainly electrostatic (the James-Healy Model), and the other mainly chemical (the Ion Exchange-Surface Complex Formation Model). Comparisons were made between these two models. The main difficulty in the theoretical predictions of the adsorption behavior of Cu(II) was the lack of the reliable data for the second hydrolysis constant(*β_ 2) The choice of the constant was {{made on the basis of}} potentiometric titratlons of Cu^(2 +) The experimental data obtained and the resulting theoretical observations were applied in models of the chemical behavior of trace metals in fresh oxic waters, with emphasis on Pb(II) and Cu(II). ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the 'free' metal ion concentration in aqueous solutions the so-called Wageningen Donnan Membrane Technique (WDMT) has been developed. This involves a continuous flow system in which the donor side and the acceptor side of the WDMT cell are continuously flushed with solution across the membrane. The new cell design allows pseudo equilibrium to be reached for the free metal ions via a Donnan equilibrium across a negatively charged ion-exchange membrane within a reasonable time span. The donor solution contains both 'free' and complexed metal ions. The concentration of the cations in the acceptor solution is either equal to the concentration of the 'free' cation concentration in the donor solution, or it can be calculated using simple correction factors. The optimization experiments have been performed with cadmium and copper, in the presence of various (in) <b>organic</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agents,</b> at various pH values, and different salt concentrations. In multi-component systems, like the systems used for the experiments with calcium, cadmium, copper, protons and EDTA, the results are in good agreement with the speciation calculations. The transport of the different cations and anions across the membrane can be very well explained by the simplified theory presented. Effects of difference in salt concentration on metal concentrations can be corrected. For the more complicated systems with natural dissolved organic matter (e. g. humic acid) the concentrations measured in the acceptor solution are also in good agreement with the speciation calculations performed for the donor solution...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the method of}} regeneration of spent electrochemical decontamination solution. The proposed method allows separation of radionuclides and stable metals from spent decontamination solution in a form suitable for final disposal and repeated use of the remaining solution for electrochemical decontamination. Development of this method {{was based on the}} results of the speciation studies which showed that Fe(III) can be precipitated in the presence of <b>organic</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agents,</b> in a form of iron hydroxide, and Ag- 110 m, Co- 60, Mn- 54 radionuclides can be coprecipitated on it. In order to verify the conclusions made as a result of the speciation studies, the experiments with electrochemically prepared simulant solution and real solution were carried out. The test results proved that the proposed method can be applied in practice. Treatment of the ultimately spent decontamination solutions can be also made applying iron precipitation, which allows for removal of the bulk amount of contaminants, as the first step. Then, if necessary the remaining radionuclides can be removed by sorption. A series of novel absorbers has been tested for their potential for the sorption removal of the remaining radionuclides from the supernate. The test results showed that most of them were more effective in neutral or alkaline range of pH, however, the high efficiency of the sorption removal can be achieved only after the removal of the oxalic and citric acids from solution...|$|R
30|$|Our simple {{synthesis}} {{method of}} metal oxide nanopowders used at low temperature without any <b>organic</b> and <b>complexing</b> <b>agent</b> allowed {{the preparation of}} pure crystalline Cu 2 O and ZnO nanopowders [14]. Briefly, metal salts are dissolved in water in stoichiometric proportions. Solutions are then mixed with a large volume of lithium hydroxide and stirred {{for half an hour}} at ambient atmosphere. The addition of dilute ascorbic acid to the copper di-hydroxide formed after the previous stage is required to form Cu 2 O. After washing with water, oxide nanoparticles of controlled size and morphology were isolated. The aqueous solvent is finally changed to ethanol and colloidal suspensions, which are stable for a few months in an azeotrope solution, can be used for thin films preparation by the dip-coating process.|$|R

40|$|Zirconia-mixed oxides can exhibit cubic {{fluorite}} and pyrochlore structure. Their {{discrimination is}} not easy in nanooxides with a crystal size close {{to that of a}} few unit cells. In this work, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) has been employed to provide key insights on the structural characterization of a nanometric and porous mixed Er 2 O 3 –ZrO 2 oxide. The material was prepared by a simple template-free solvothermal route that provided nanocrystalline powders at low temperature (170 °C) with spherical morphology, and high surface area (∼ 280 m 2 g− 1). The porosity was mainly originated from the assembling of <b>organic</b> <b>complexing</b> <b>agents</b> used in the synthesis to limit the crystal growth and to control hydrolysis and condensation reaction rates. The samples were characterized by thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and N 2 adsorption measurements. A detailed study by HRTEM was conducted on microtomed samples. It was observed that the material was made of nanocrystals packed into spherical agglomerates. HRTEM simulations indicated that {{it is not possible to}} identify the pyrochlore phase in nanoparticles with diameter below 2 nm. In our samples, the analysis of the HRTEM lattice images by means of fast Fourier transform (FFT) techniques revealed well defined spots that can be assigned to different planes of a cubic fluorite-type phase, even in the raw material. Raman spectroscopy was also a powerful technique to elucidate the crystalline phase of the materials with the smallest nanoparticles. HREM and Raman results evidenced that the material is constituted, irrespective of the temperature of the final calcination step, by an ensemble of randomly oriented nanocrystals with fluorite structure. This study opens new perspectives for the design of synthetic approaches to prepare nanooxides (fluorites and pyrochlores) and the analysis of their crystalline structure...|$|R
