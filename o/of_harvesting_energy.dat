5000|$|For example, {{the ability}} of capnophiles to {{tolerate}} (or utilize) the amount of oxygen that is also in their environment may vary widely and may be far more critical to their survival. Species of Campylobacter are bacterial capnophiles that are more easily identified because they are also microaerophiles, organisms that can grow in high carbon dioxide {{as long as a}} small amount of free oxygen is present, but at a dramatically reduced concentration. (In the earth's atmosphere carbon dioxide levels are approximately five hundred times lower than that of oxygen, 0.04% and 21% of the total, respectively.) Obligate anaerobes are microbes that will die in the presence of oxygen without respect to the concentration of carbon dioxide in their environment, and typically acquire energy through anaerobic respiration, or fermentation (biochemistry). [...] In 2004, a capnophilic bacterium was characterized that appears to require carbon dioxide. This organism, Mannheimia succiniciproducens, has a unique metabolism involving carbon fixation. While carbon fixation is common to most plant life on earth since it is the key initial step in the biosynthesis of complex carbon compounds during photosynthesis (the Calvin cycle), it is found in relatively few microorganisms and not found in animals. Mannheimia succiniciproducens can attach carbon dioxide to the three-carbon backbone of phosphoenolpyruvate, an endproduct in glycolysis, to generate the four-carbon compound, oxaloacetic acid, an intermediate in the Krebs cycle. Although Mannheimia succiniciproducens has most of the intermediates in the Krebs cycle, it is not capable of oxidative phosphorylation, the final step in the electron transport chain that would allow it to carry out the highly efficient process <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>energy</b> by aerobic respiration.|$|E

30|$|Wireless sensing systems, such as {{structure}} health monitoring, biomedical sensing, {{and environment}} monitoring, are usually expected to operate uninterruptedly and autonomously over years or decades under extremely stringent energy constraints.

Abstract: We {{consider}} a Sensor-Aided Cognitive Radio Network (SACRN) in which sensors capable <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>energy</b> are {{distributed throughout the}} network to support secondary transmitters for sensing licensed channels {{in order to improve}} both energy and spectral efficiency. Harvesting ambient energy {{is one of the most}} promising solutions to mitigate energy deficiency, prolong device lifetime, and partly reduce the battery size of devices.

In the paper, we also investigate long-term throughput in the scheduling window, and formulate the throughput maximization problem by considering energy-neutral operation conditions of type-I and-II sensors and the target detection probability.

30|$|Second, {{the ability}} <b>of</b> <b>harvesting</b> <b>energy</b> is usually {{heterogeneous}} among distinct nodes. This {{is because the}} energy-producing ability of environments and the energy-accumulating ability of harvesters are possibly different. For instance, in a vibration-powered scenario, a harvester with a small surface of sensing vibration signals will output power lower than that output by the harvester with a large sensing surface, and then it may need more time for recharging before communication can be carried out. Thus, a new challenge facing the link scheduling is that the heterogeneity of ambient power sources must be accounted for.|$|E

The proposed H-DHT protocol has a hybrid multiple access structure which employs both TDMA and CSMA, {{in order to}} manage different traffic patterns and requirements depending on applications.
