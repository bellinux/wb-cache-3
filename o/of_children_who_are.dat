However, this evidence may be confounded by improvements seen in autistic children who grow up without treatment, by the difficulty of verifying reports of improvements, and by the lack of reporting of treatments' negative outcomes.

They declare her their [...] "hero" [...] for holding the gay penguin wedding, but Leslie insists it was simply a publicity stunt, not a political statement.

Some of the education system's problems include: [...] not enough financial resources to operate schools and salaries of the teachers, not enough materials to reconstruct damaged schools, and lack of machinery to print textbooks and provide school supplies. These are caused by the unstable government that cannot offer enough financial support since many schools are either damaged or used for other purposes. Due to warfare and destruction of schools, the education ministry, fortunately, was able to send teams to oversee primary and secondary schools' final exam in order to give students 15-16 school year certificates. Currently, the UNICEF is raising money to support students and fix schools damaged by armed conflicts.|$|E
