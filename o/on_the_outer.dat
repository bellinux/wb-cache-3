5|$|In a {{significant}} difference from other woodswallows, dusky woodswallows have a distinctive white patch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> wing. Dusky woodswallows also seem to typically be more smoky brown than other species of woodswallow. The little woodswallow, a smaller, darker woodswallow is also slightly more smoky brown that other woodswallows, {{but that is the}} only similarity that the latter has with the dusky woodswallow; the little woodswallow does not share a white patch <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> wing.|$|E

5|$|A careful {{examination}} of Facsimile No. 2 {{shows that there}} is a difference between most of the hieroglyphic signs and the signs on the right third of the figure <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> edge as well as the outer portions of the sections numbered 12–15. These signs are hieratic, not hieroglyphic, and are inverted, or upside down, to the rest of the text. In fact, they are a fairly accurate copy of lines 2, 3, and 4 of the Joseph Smith Papyrus XI, which contains a portion of the Book of Breathings. Especially clear is the word snsn, in section 14, and part of the name of the mother of the owner of the papyrus, (tay-)uby.t, repeated twice <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> edge. An ink drawing of the hypocephalus in the Church Historian's office shows these same areas as being blank. It is likely that these portions were destroyed on the original hypocephalus and someone (the engraver, one of Joseph Smith's associates, or Joseph himself) copied the lines from the Book of Breathings papyrus for aesthetic purposes.|$|E

25|$|In 1982 <b>the</b> <b>outer</b> {{concourse}} {{was completed}} during the SANFL season giving {{a limited number}} of permanent undercover seats for the general public.

5|$|Due to his weak {{performances}} in the opening matches, Harvey was omitted for the match against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's.

However, the diesel power plant was not ready in time to be installed in Prinzregent Luitpold, so the ship sailed with only two shafts. On trials, Prinzregent Luitpold was approximately one half knot slower than her sisters.|$|E
