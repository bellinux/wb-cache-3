40|$|Law 55 / 2006 (entitled “Amendments to the Civil Code {{dealing with}} “Patto di Famiglia”), which came into force on March 16 th 2006, amended the Italian Civil Code by {{creating}} <b>the</b> legal institute <b>of</b> “patto di famiglia”, which aims at allowing <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> enterprise or shareholdings during <b>the</b> life <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enterpreurner and entails {{an exception to}} inheritance rules. Many interpretative problems arise from <b>the</b> unclear phrasing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new regulation; among these the most relevant one - both in theory and in practice - relates to <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> necessary parties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “patto di famiglia”, whose defect of consent leads to voidness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract. In particular, it is not certain whether the spouse and the persons entitled by law to a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> estate to whom the enterprise and/or the shares are not assigned must participate to the contract. Namely, since <b>the</b> first paragraph <b>of</b> article 768 -quater CC, provides that “the spouse and any person who would be entitled by law to a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> estate existing at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agreement must participate to the agreement”, some authors argue that the persons entitled by law to a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> estate should give their consent to the “patto di famiglia”, while, according to others, those have just to be informed of its conclusion. Three theories were formulated with regard to articles 768 bis, 768 quater, paragraph 1 and 768 paragraph 1 CC. According to both first and second theory, the persons entitled by law to a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> estate must be {{a party to the}} “patto di famiglia”, however, while according to the former their participation is not essential, for the latter <b>the</b> lack <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persons entitled by law to a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> estate existing at <b>the</b> time <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conclusion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> agreement makes the contract void. A third point <b>of</b> view assumes <b>the</b> ‘patto di famiglia’ as a special contract for <b>the</b> benefit <b>of</b> third parties: <b>the</b> participation to <b>the</b> contract <b>of</b> any person who is not assignee <b>of</b> <b>the</b> enterprise and/or the shares and would be entitled by law to a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> estate is considered to be required by art. 768 quater CC for a different purpose than <b>the</b> participation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disposing ascendant and assignee descendant (art. 768 bis). Namely, whilst <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latters is necessary for <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract, <b>the</b> agreement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persons who would be entitled by law to a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> estate and are not assignees is required {{in order to make the}} agreement enforceable towards them and to convert <b>the</b> share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> testator’s estate reserved by law for certain heirs into the right to receive its monetary value, which has to be calculated considering the enterprise and/or the shareholdings’ value. This paper analyses the matter above and <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persons who would be entitled by law to a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s.</b> <b>The</b> research leads to the conclusion that <b>the</b> participation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persons entitled by law to a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> estate non-assegnees is required for <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract. <b>The</b> regulation <b>of</b> “patto di famiglia” appears to be inspired by <b>the</b> criterion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compulsory involvement at law of all persons entitled by law to a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> estate existing at a given time, because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> relevancy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> their interests at stake: far from being considered mere parties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract, they must be regarded as essential parties instead, whose consent is necessary for <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “patto di famiglia” (Art. 1418, paragraph 1, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Civil Code). Therefore, if one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persons entitled by law to a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> estate cannot or does not want to participate to the agreement, it will not be possibile to conclude the “patto di famiglia”; instead, the enterprises’s and/or the enterprises shareholdings’ transfer should be guaranteed by using different kinds of contractual agreements. This conclusion also seems to be confirmed by the unsuccessful attempts made to amend the Italian “patto di famiglia” regulation over 2011 and 2012. Namely, all the legislative initiatives providing <b>the</b> amendment <b>of</b> Art. 768, letter d) CC, concerning the “participation” to the ‘patto di famiglia’, layed out the possibility for the agreement to be drawn up also without <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> all <b>the</b> persons entitled by law to a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> estate. Such proposals seem to confirm the fact that the regulation now in force subordinates <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “patto di famiglia” to <b>the</b> consent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persons entitled by law to a share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased’s</b> estate...|$|R

40|$|MBA) North-West University, Mafikeng Campus, 2005 <b>The</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} experiences and perceptions of private · medical practitioners about <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current death notification form (Bl- 1663) in cases of confirmed Aids-related deaths. The study focussed on reporting patterns by private medical practitioners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased's</b> underlying causes <b>of</b> death in BI- 1663. The study also focussed on the reasons advanced for the reporting patterns described above. The research method employed in {{this study was}} cross-sectional surveys. Self-administered questionnaires were used to gather the data and the target population was all private medical practitioners practising within the Mafikeng / Mmabatho area <b>of</b> <b>the</b> North West Province of South Africa. A response rate of eighty-two and half per cent (82, 50 %) was achieved. The data were presented in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> frequency tables and pie charts and descriptive statistics was used to analyse it. <b>The</b> findings <b>of</b> this study revealed that <b>the</b> majority <b>of</b> private medical practitioners either omitted information that HIV / AIDS was an underlying cause of death or reported another condition in BI- 1663 during notification of confirmed AIDS related deaths. Reasons advanced for the phenomenon were fears of unauthorised breach <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased's</b> confidential information by unintended parties that often led to invalidation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased's</b> insurance and funeral benefits, as well as stigmatisation and social discrimination <b>of</b> relatives <b>the</b> <b>deceased.</b> <b>The</b> study recommends that third parties (informants) should be relieved <b>of</b> <b>the</b> duties <b>of</b> conveying <b>the</b> <b>deceased's</b> confidential medical information to the state during death notification processes. Medical practitioners themselves should submit Part 2 of BI- 1663 that contains <b>the</b> <b>deceased's</b> confidential information directly to Public Health Officials.

5|$|A large {{quantity}} of funerary urns have been excavated from {{the bases of}} buildings; the deceased were cremated and their ashes collected in the urns.

The Postclassic Maya custom of interring the cremated remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>deceased</b> in urns was restricted to the elite; commoners where buried in simple tombs outside the city centre.

Funerary urns have been found interred under all the principal plazas of the city. Approximately equal proportions of urns were interred under platforms and under the ceremonial architecture represented by pyramids and altars, although it is impossible to say if those individuals buried under religious architecture had differing roles than those buried under secular architecture.|$|E
