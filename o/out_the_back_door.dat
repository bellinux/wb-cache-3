5|$|Gibson's Brigade {{continued}} south, waking the 37th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry. This unit fled in all directions, and Gibson's men did {{not need}} to shoot. This left the 36th Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, between Gibson's Brigade and General Johnson's headquarters at the McNeill house. The 36th offered the best resistance Gibson had faced so far, but the surprised Confederates were forced to retreat toward the McNeill farm. Near the McNeill house the men from the Confederate Baltimore Battery attempted to fire canister from their two guns, but the unit and guns were captured by the 8th Ohio Cavalry before they could be fired. General Johnson was nearly captured when his headquarters was partially surrounded by Union cavalry. He escaped <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> and jumped on a horse—racing south to the 8th Virginia Cavalry.|$|E
25|$|Sergeant Robert A. Owens, from Company A, 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines, was posthumously {{awarded the}} Medal of Honor {{for his actions}} in {{eliminating}} a Japanese 75mm gun that had been shelling the landing force, after it had destroyed four landing craft and damaged ten others. At the cost of his life, Owens approached the gun emplacement, entered it through the fire port, and drove the crew <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Earps and a posse {{tracked the}} men down and arrested Luther King, who confessed {{he had been}} holding the reins while Bill Leonard, Harry [...] "The Kid" [...] Head, and Jim Crain robbed the stage. They arrested King and Sheriff Johnny Behan escorted him to jail, but somehow King walked {{in the front door}} and almost {{immediately}} <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
60|$|Fanny Mere {{stepped from}} her hiding-place and ran <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> and by <b>the</b> garden gate into the road.|$|R
60|$|When he {{had given}} these {{directions}} he ran <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> and hid behind a barrel. A few minutes later the robbers arrived, and called loudly for the shoemaker.|$|R
60|$|Heyst {{interrupted}} himself, with a listening turn of his head. He {{had heard}} the faint sound of sticks being snapped in the compound. He rose and crossed the room to look <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b>|$|R
500|$|Ribby has two ovens, {{one above}} the other, and {{she puts her}} mouse pie in the lower oven. She tidies the house, sets the table, and leaves to buy tea, marmalade, and sugar. Duchess {{meantime}} has left home with her ham and veal pie in a basket, passes Ribby on the street, and hurries on to Ribby's house. [...] She puts her pie into the upper oven, and searches quickly for the mouse pie (which she does not find because she neglects {{to look in the}} lower oven). She slips <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> as Ribby returns.|$|E
500|$|Several {{shots were}} exchanged: {{the house was}} riddled with bullets, but the whites did not {{overtake}} it. [...] The standoff lasted long into the next morning, when Sarah and Sylvester Carrier were found dead inside the house; several others were wounded, including a child who {{had been shot in}} the eye. Two white men, C. P. [...] "Poly" [...] Wilkerson and Henry Andrews, were killed; Wilkerson had kicked in the front door, and Andrews was behind him. At least four whites were wounded, one possibly fatally. The remaining children in the Carrier house were spirited <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> into the woods. They crossed dirt roads one at a time, then hid under brush until they had all gathered away from Rosewood.|$|E
500|$|By chance, Johnson {{and three}} of his men, Lieutenant Daniel Toler and Sergeants Love and Miller, were still awake and {{discussing}} tactics. [...] Mexican troops {{had been told that}} the house where Johnson was quartered was one of their targets, yet a lamp burned in the window, signalling that this was the home of a loyalist. [...] Out of an abundance of caution, a group of troops knocked on the door. [...] Before the Texians could open the door, they heard the gunfire from the town square. [...] Toler looked out a window and saw uniformed troops on the porch. [...] Without opening the door, he told the soldiers, in Spanish, that there were no troops there, but he would open the door momentarily. [...] The fighting moved into the street, and soldiers who had been guarding {{the back door of the}} house rushed around to the front. [...] Johnson, Toler, Love, and Miller dashed <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> and escaped.|$|E
60|$|Still, he had {{no thought}} of {{breaking}} the engagement which he had made. He went to his room, made a bundle of his worldly possessions, and crept <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> down <b>the</b> road to the circus.|$|R
60|$|Peter Sadler {{threw himself}} {{back in his}} chair and laughed with such great roars that two hunting-dogs, who were asleep in the hall, sprang to their feet and dashed <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> their tails between their legs.|$|R
60|$|Then {{she slipped}} <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> again, and ran swiftly to the barn, {{fastening}} on her clean cuffs and collar as she ran. The fugitive was anxiously awaiting her, {{with a slight}} touch of brusqueness in his eagerness.|$|R
500|$|Rep. Jeff Miller. Republican of Florida, {{chairs the}} House Veterans Affairs Committee. He {{said that the}} new VA law gives agency {{officials}} five days to respond to notices of intent to fire them. The director of the Georgia VA retired four days in advance of VA's announcement {{that he would be}} fired, and the procurement official also retired in advance of her firing. The procurement official was nearly hired by the U.S. Department of Energy before that department learned of the findings against her at the VA. Miller said that [...] "If any current laws or regulations are impeding the (VA)’s ability to swiftly hold employees accountable, VA leaders must work with Congress so those laws and regulations can be changed", and “VA appears to be giving failing executives an opportunity to quit, retire or find new jobs without consequence." [...] He said he opposed allowing officials who had committed misconduct being allowed to “slip <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> with a pension." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tim's brother, {{the real}} Ben, finally tracks Tim down at Emily's house, {{saying that he}} must return his IRS credentials. After a passionate sexual {{interlude}} with Emily, and with Ben waiting outside her house, Tim disappears <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> leaving her sleeping. He returns on foot to the motel, first stopping by the hospital to ask the doctor if any chance exists that Emily will improve. Discovering that she will likely die before a donated organ becomes available, he decides [...] "it's time".|$|E
2500|$|Inside the bank, the {{assistant}} cashier Joseph Lee Heywood refused {{to open the}} safe and was murdered for resisting. The two other employees in the bank were teller Alonzo Bunker and assistant bookkeeper Frank Wilcox. Bunker escaped from the bank by running <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> despite being wounded in the right shoulder by Pitts as he ran. The three robbers then {{ran out of the}} bank after hearing the shooting outside and mounted their horses to make a run for it, having taken only several bags of nickels from the bank. Every year in September, Northfield hosts [...] "Defeat of Jesse James Days", a celebration of the town's victory over the James–Younger Gang.|$|E
6000|$|... "We went downstairs, and I {{borrowed}} two overcoats that {{we found}} hanging there, {{and put them on}} over our uniforms. Then we went <b>out,</b> by <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> and ran as hard as we could, keeping through narrow lanes, to the barracks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! heavens!" [...] she said, [...] "there is {{my father}} calling me. I came <b>out</b> by <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> but mother must have been {{up to my room}} and found me gone. She watches me all day now. What shall I do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|He went <b>out</b> to <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> where <b>the</b> {{boys had}} been at play, and shouted out, [...] "David! DA--VID! DWI--GHT! DA--VID!"

2500|$|Mr. Andrew arrived home, {{and they}} {{continued}} to argue with Dann, insisting she give up the second gun. Dann called her mother again and this time Mr. Andrew spoke with Mrs. Wasserman, asking her to persuade Dann {{to give up the}} gun. While Dann spoke with her mother, Mrs. Andrew left the house and alerted the police. Mr. Andrew told Dann that he would not remain in the house if she did not put down the gun, and also left the house. [...] Dann ordered Philip to stay. Just before noon, seeing the police advancing on the house she shot Philip in the chest, but he managed to escape <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> before collapsing and being rescued by the police and ambulance personnel.|$|E
60|$|As the {{man went}} <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> I complimented my wife. She {{was really an}} admirable hostess.|$|E
6000|$|... "The good Father Claude {{does not}} know Norman of Torn if he thinks he runs <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> like an old woman because a sword looks in at the front door." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is gone--escaped--fled--what do I know of him?" [...] {{said the}} glover. [...] "He got <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> and so through the little garden. Think not of him, but {{come and see}} the Valentine whose honour and life you have saved this morning." ...|$|R
60|$|ON {{the great}} western prairies of Dakota {{is a little}} town called Edgeley, because {{it is on the}} edge of civilization--a very big word which means some folks have found a better way to live than other folks. The Edgeley people have a good way to live, for there are almost {{seventeen}} wooden houses there, and among them is a school-house, a church, a store and a blacksmith-shop. If people walked out their front doors they were upon the little street; if they walked <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>doors</b> they were on the broad prairies. That was why Twinkle, who was a farmer's little girl, lived so near the town that she could easily walk to school.|$|R
50|$|Scared of defamation, Chaurasia ran <b>out</b> through <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> only to {{be caught}} by the villagers and was beaten up by them.

6000|$|He {{urgently}} {{interrupted her}} tragic farewell. [...] "Say! Gee whillikins! I know what we'll do. You sneak <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> and I'll meet you, and we'll {{run away and}} go seek-our-fortunes and we'll find your cousin----" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Peter Rabbit did a {{very brave}} thing. He remembered that Johnny Chuck could not run very fast and that if it hadn't been for him, Johnny Chuck would be safe at home. [...] "You stay right here," [...] whispered Peter Rabbit. Then he slipped <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b> Half-way down the hill he stopped and shouted: ...|$|E
60|$|Why {{the pale}} doubt that flitteth dim and nebulous athwart the {{forecastle}} of your third sentence? Have no fears. Your piece {{will be a}} Go. It will go <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> on the first night. They've all done it--the 1364. So will 1365. Not one of us ever thought of the simple device of half-soling himself with a stove-lid. Ah, what suffering a little hindsight would have saved us. Treasure this hint.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{man came}} {{and talked with}} your father in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> garden--just under this window.

6000|$|... "Yes, I {{think it}} would be the wisest thing," [...] said Alexander Abraham--not disagreeably this time, but reflectively, as if there was some doubt about the matter. [...] "I'll let you <b>out</b> by <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b> Then the--ahem!--the dog will not {{interfere}} with you. Please go away quietly and quickly." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} the clock. [...] "I don't think so," [...] she said quietly. [...] "It's hours since I slipped <b>out</b> by <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door.</b> They have very strict rules about runaway girls--even when their friends bring them back. If you send me back--" [...] she stopped, and looked thoughtfully into the fire.|$|R
60|$|A {{few days}} after that, a gang of the La Junta boomers came to the ranch and wanted us to go back with them. Naturally, we declined. We had the house on them, and before we were done refusing, that old 'dobe was plumb full of lead. When dark came we fagged 'em a batch of bullets and shoved <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> for the rocks. They sure smoked us as we went. We had to drift, which we did, and rounded up down in Oklahoma.|$|E
60|$|By and by Granny Fox {{came to a}} hole in the ground, an {{old house}} that had once belonged to her grandfather. Now this old house had a back door hidden close beside the hollow trunk of a fallen tree. Old Granny Fox just ran through the house, <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> through the hollow tree, and then jumped into a little brook where there was hardly more than enough water to wet her feet. Walking in the water, she left no scent in her tracks.|$|E
6000|$|... "So I set {{still in}} my room in the attic, an' Gran'dad set still in the room downstairs, an' it must 'a' be'n pretty late when I heard him get up an' go out. I slipped down right after him, meanin' to foller him, an' let myself <b>out</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> so's he wouldn't see me.

6000|$|Amyas went <b>out,</b> and at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door,</b> {{leaning on}} his staff, stood a tall, raw-boned, ragged man, [...] "pinked all over," [...] as the steward had said.|$|R
50|$|The Chettinad {{houses are}} built on a rectangular, {{traversal}} plot that stretches across two streets,with the front door opening into the first street and <b>the</b> <b>back</b> into <b>the</b> second.

60|$|With these {{directions}} and a kiss, Miss Penny, as Cicely did not stir, let <b>the</b> child <b>out</b> at <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>door</b> of <b>the</b> long hall, {{and watched her}} walk demurely down the main path of the prim old garden, where no child had played for years, and even the toads and fat robins behaved in the most decorous manner.|$|R
