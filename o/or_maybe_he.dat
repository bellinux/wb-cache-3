60|$|Gale {{dismounted}} to {{lead his}} horse, to go forward more slowly. He had ridden sixty miles since morning, and he was tired, and a not entirely healed wound in his hip made one leg drag a little. A mile up the arroyo, near its head, lay the Papago Well. The need of water for his horse entailed a risk that otherwise he could have avoided. The well was on Mexican soil. Gale distinguished a faint light flickering through the thin, sharp foliage. Campers were at the well, and, whoever they were, no doubt they had prevented Ladd from meeting Gale. Ladd {{had gone back to}} the next waterhole, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was hiding in an arroyo to the eastward, awaiting developments.|$|E
60|$|There {{were six}} in the brood. Five were hardy little fellows that made the water boil behind them as they scurried across the lake. But the sixth was a weakling. He had been hurt, by a hawk perhaps, or a big trout, or a mink; or he had {{swallowed}} a bone; <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was just a weak little fellow with no accounting for it. Whenever the brood were startled, he struggled bravely {{a little while to}} keep up; then he always fell behind. The mother would come back, and urge, and help him; but it was of little use. He was not strong enough; and the last glimpse I always had of them was a foamy wake disappearing round a distant point, while far in the rear was a ripple where the little fellow still paddled away, doing his best pathetically.|$|E
60|$|Could he borrow of any one? Had he {{nothing of}} his own to sell or exchange? Ah! {{if it had not}} been for that stupid hoard of little David's, he might have had even so much! By-the-bye, some of that {{collection}} was his own. He might quite lawfully take that back again. How much could it be? How much did he put in last week? the week before? Oh, never mind; some of it was his at all events; there was no harm in taking that. Most likely he should be able to restore it four-fold when Colonel Carey made his present; or, if not, nobody knew exactly what was in Toby Fillpot; and after all very likely they would forget all about it; people could not think about pigs when Mamma was ill; <b>or,</b> <b>maybe,</b> <b>he</b> should go to join his ship, and hear no more of it.

The porter was a pretty thick-headed darky, but he was lion-hearted; and his idea was to lay hold of a burglar wherever he could find him. There were plenty of burglars in the aisle there, or people that were afraid of burglars, {{and they seemed to}} think the porter had a good idea. They had hold of one another already, and now began to pull {{up and down the aisles}} in a way that reminded me of the old-fashioned mesmeric lecturers, when they told their subjects that they were this or that, and set them to acting the part. I remembered how once when the mesmerist gave out that they were at a horse--race, and his subjects all got astride of their chairs, and galloped up and down the hall like a lot of little boys on laths. I thought of that now, and although it was rather a serious business, for I didn't know what minute they would come to blows, I couldn't help laughing. The sight was weird enough. Every one looked like a somnambulist as he pulled and hauled. The young lady in the stateroom was doing her full share. She was screaming, 'Won't somebody let me out?' and hammering on the door. I guess it was her screaming and hammering that brought the conductor at last, <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> just came round in the course of nature to take up the tickets. It was before the time when they took the tickets at the gate, and you used to stick them into a little slot at the side of your berth, and the conductor came along and took them in the night, somewhere between Worcester and Springfield, I should say." ...|$|E
60|$|The oddest of Philip's masters was {{his teacher}} of French. Monsieur Ducroz was {{a citizen of}} Geneva. He was a tall old man, with a sallow skin and hollow cheeks; his gray hair was thin and long. He wore shabby black clothes, with holes at the elbows of his coat and frayed trousers. His linen was very dirty. Philip {{had never seen him}} in a clean collar. He was a man of few words, who gave his lesson conscientiously but without enthusiasm, {{arriving}} as the clock struck and leaving on the minute. His charges were very small. He was taciturn, and what Philip learnt about him he learnt from others: it appeared that he had fought with Garibaldi against the Pope, but had left Italy in disgust when it was clear that all his efforts for freedom, by which he meant the establishment of a republic, tended to no more than an exchange of yokes; he had been expelled from Geneva for it was not known what political offences. Philip looked upon him with puzzled surprise; for he was very unlike his idea of the revolutionary: he spoke in a low voice and was extraordinarily polite; he never sat down till he was asked to; and when on rare occasions he met Philip in the street took off his hat with an elaborate gesture; he never laughed, he never even smiled. A more complete imagination than Philip's might have pictured a youth of splendid hope, for he must have been entering upon manhood in 1848 when kings, remembering their brother of France, went about with an uneasy crick in their necks; and perhaps that passion for liberty which passed through Europe, sweeping before it what of absolutism and tyranny had reared its head during the reaction from the revolution of 1789, filled no breast with a hotter fire. One might fancy him, passionate with theories of human equality and human rights, discussing, arguing, fighting behind barricades in Paris, flying before the Austrian cavalry in Milan, imprisoned here, exiled from there, hoping on and upborne ever with the word which seemed so magical, the word Liberty; till at last, broken with disease and starvation, old, without means to keep body and soul together but such lessons as he could pick up from poor students, he found himself in that little neat town under the heel of a personal tyranny greater than any in Europe. Perhaps his taciturnity hid a contempt for the human race which had abandoned the great dreams of his youth and now wallowed in sluggish ease; or perhaps these thirty years of revolution had taught him that men are unfit for liberty, and he thought that he had spent his life in the pursuit of that which was not worth the finding. <b>Or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> was tired out and waited only with indifference for the release of death.|$|E
500|$|A concept album, Man on the Moon: The End of Day is an autobiographical track {{series of}} moody dark {{material}} that is separated into five acts that all surround [...] "Day 'n' Nite" [...] with an arcane account.

He eventually gets recognized as the star he always knew he was, and lives the superstar life… <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he's</b> still dreaming about that stage of his life, and we're just witnessing what his dreams sound like." [...] According to Cudi, more lively songs had to be added so that listeners did not feel like they were listening to a [...] "slit-your-wrists album". It was observed by a reviewer that on Man on the Moon: The End of Day, Cudi neither raps nor sings, instead he goes [...] "puzzling through some third way: a sort of loose, hazily melodic talking." [...] Musical collaborators included Kanye West, Ratatat and MGMT, among others, and the record is narrated by Common. Lyrically, he raps about anxiety and his frequent nightmares.|$|R

6000|$|I {{waited for}} this voyage always with {{excitement}} and boasted to other boys about it, and when I {{was a little}} boy had walked with my feet apart as I had seen sailors walk. I used to be sea-sick, but I must have hidden this from the other boys and partly even from myself; for, as I look back, I remember very little about it, while I remember stories I was told by the captain or by his first mate, and the look of the great cliffs of Donegal & Tory Island men coming alongside with lobsters, talking Irish and, if it was night, blowing on a burning sod to draw our attention. The captain, an old man with square shoulders and a fringe of grey hair round his face, would tell his first mate, a very admiring man, of fights he had had on shore at Liverpool; and perhaps it was of him I was thinking when I was very small and asked my grandmother if God was as strong as sailors. Once, at any rate, he had been nearly wrecked; the Liverpool had been all but blown upon the Mull of Galloway with her shaft broken, and the captain had said to his mate, [...] "mind and jump when she strikes, for we don't want to be killed by the falling spars;" [...] and when the mate answered, [...] "my God, I cannot swim," [...] he had said, [...] "who could keep afloat for five minutes in a sea like that?" [...] He would often say his mate was the most timid of men and that [...] "a girl along the quays could laugh him out of anything." [...] My grandfather had more than once given the mate a ship of his own, but he had always thrown up his berth to sail with his old captain where he felt safe. Once he had been put in charge of a ship in a dry dock in Liverpool, but a boy was drowned in Sligo, and before the news could reach him he wired to his wife, [...] "ghost, come at once, or I will throw up berth." [...] He had been wrecked a number of times and maybe that had broken his nerve <b>or</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>he</b> had a sensitiveness that would in another class have given him taste & culture. I once forgot a copy of [...] "Count Robert of Paris" [...] on a deck-seat, and when I found it again, it was all covered with the prints of his dirty thumb. He had once seen the coach-a-baur or death coach. It came along the road, he said, till it was hidden by a cottage and it never came out {{on the other side of}} the cottage. Once I smelled new-mown hay when we were quite a long way from land, and once when I was watching the sea-parrots (as the sailors call the puffin) I noticed they had different ways of tucking their heads under their wings, or I fancied it and said to the captain [...] "they have different characters." [...] Sometimes my father came too, and the sailors when they saw him coming would say [...] "there is John Yeats and we shall have a storm," [...] for he was considered unlucky.|$|E

It wa'n't any use; they hadn't took a trick. Of course they felt kind of ashamed before all those people, and well they might. Now, what would a magnanimous man do? Keep still, wouldn't he?
