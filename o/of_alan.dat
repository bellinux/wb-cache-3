5|$|At the {{beginning}} of March 2014, the structural framework for a new pedestrian walkway/footbridge over the junction <b>of</b> <b>Alan</b> Turing Way and Ashton New Road connecting the CFA with the Etihad Stadium was lowered into place. With sponsor Suisse Power & Gas SA having subsequently secured the naming rights, the completed SuisseGas Bridge was officially opened and turned over to Manchester City Council for general public access on 26 November 2014. Twelve days later, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, presided over the official opening of the CFA.|$|E
5000|$|Stephen <b>of</b> Tréguier's son <b>Alan</b> (c. 1116-1146), was {{the first}} of these lords to be styled 'Earl of Richmond' in a {{strictly}} legal sense. King Stephen also created <b>Alan</b> 1st Earl <b>of</b> Cornwall although this title would be forfeit in 1141 after the Battle <b>of</b> Lincoln. <b>Alan</b> <b>of</b> Brittany is recorded as riding at King Stephen's side in the Battle <b>of</b> Lincoln. <b>Alan</b> Rufus, Stephen <b>of</b> Tréguier, and <b>Alan</b> were members <b>of</b> [...] "the Richmond-Penthievre... and this family... maintained its rivalry with its ducal cousins Brittany into the next century."

50|$|Under Goar, they {{allied with}} the Burgundians led by Gundaharius, with whom they {{installed}} the usurping Emperor Jovinus. Under Goar's successor Sangiban, the <b>Alans</b> <b>of</b> Orléans {{played a critical role}} in repelling the invasion of Attila the Hun at the Battle of Châlons. After the 5th century, however, the <b>Alans</b> <b>of</b> Gaul were subsumed in the territorial struggles between the Franks and the Visigoths, and ceased to have an independent existence. In order to quell unrest, Flavius Aëtius settled large numbers <b>of</b> <b>Alans</b> in various areas, such as in and around Armorica. Several towns with names possibly related to 'Alan', such as Allainville, Yvelines, Alainville-en Beauce, Loiret, Allaines and Allainville, Eure-et-Loir, and Les Allains, Eure, are taken as evidence that a contingent settled in Armorica, Brittany. Other areas <b>of</b> <b>Alans</b> settlement were notably around Orléans and Valentia. It seems that the personal name Alan, which originated in Brittany, derives from these people.|$|R
5|$|B of the Bang {{was located}} {{next to the}} City of Manchester Stadium at Sportcity, in Beswick, at the corner <b>of</b> <b>Alan</b> Turing Way and Ashton New Road;. It took its name from a {{quotation}} of British sprinter Linford Christie {{in which he said}} that he started his races not merely at the 'bang' of the starting pistol, but at 'The B of the Bang'. The artwork had been nicknamed KerPlunk by the locals after the popular children's game from the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, an American {{film crew}} disappears in the Amazon {{rainforest}} while filming {{a documentary about}} indigenous cannibal tribes. The team consists <b>of</b> <b>Alan</b> Yates, the director; Faye Daniels, his girlfriend and script girl; and two cameramen, Jack Anders and Mark Tomaso. Harold Monroe, an anthropologist at New York University, agrees to lead a rescue team in hopes of finding the missing filmmakers. In anticipation of his arrival, the military conducts a raid on the local Yacumo tribe and takes a young male hostage {{in order to help}} negotiate with the natives. Monroe flies in via floatplane and is introduced to his guides, Chaco and his assistant, Miguel.|$|E
5|$|In April 2015 Polygon {{published}} an article describing the development process <b>of</b> <b>Alan</b> Wake 2 that started shortly after the first game released. Alan Wake 2 already had a working prototype and Remedy was prepared to pitch the game to Microsoft. However, according to Sam Lake, Remedy's founder, Microsoft wanted something else {{and development of the}} sequel has shifted to Quantum Break. Most of the ideas for Alan Wake 2 were implemented on American Nightmare. Like the game's location, the Arizona Desert.|$|E

50|$|Respendial's fate is unknown; by 418, he {{had been}} succeeded by Attaces, who was killed when the Visigoths invaded Hispania. This group <b>of</b> <b>Alans</b> {{thereafter}} united with the Asding Vandals, with whom they crossed into Africa and established an independent kingdom.|$|R
5|$|In June 2016 it was {{revealed}} that a five-man New IRA hit team were in Dublin's north inner city looking to murder two leading gangsters after one of their associates was shot dead in a gangland feud. Sources said the murder squad from the North spent several days and nights looking for their targets in the streets. In September 2016 a close associate <b>of</b> <b>Alan</b> Ryan, who had been arrested and imprisoned following the Stamullen raid, was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment in Belfast for possession of a sub-machine gun and ammunition, after getting off a bus from Dublin.|$|E
5|$|More {{recent studies}} however suggest that Eutharic's Amali ancestry {{may have been}} a {{deliberate}} invention on the part of Theoderic to aid his ambitions of establishing dynastic credibility. According to Gesta Theoderici Eutharic belonged to the Gothic house <b>of</b> <b>Alan</b> rather than the house of Amal. Whilst Jordanes, in his history of the Goths, does make reference to Eutharic's prudentia et virtus, or pride and valour, this too {{may have been a}} fabrication on the part of Theoderic. Those qualities were recognised as requirements of Gothic ethnographic ideology, expressed in their code of civilitas. It would have been highly beneficial for Theoderic's chosen son-in-law to possess them.|$|E
5|$|Some {{commentators}} noted further influences from {{comic book}} literature. Adams likened Cohle to the protagonist <b>of</b> <b>Alan</b> Moore's The Courtyard and drew parallels with Grant Morrison's The Invisibles for the show's brief exploration of M-theory {{with one of}} Cohle's monologues. ComicsAlliance and New York columnist Abraham Riesman cited Top 10 as {{the inspiration for the}} season finale based on dialogue from the episode's closing scene.|$|E
50|$|At the age <b>of</b> 4, <b>Alan</b> {{appeared}} (in scenes deleted) in the 1984 Russian film 'Shutki v storonu' (Jokes Aside) {{though his}} image {{remained on the}} movie's poster. At the age <b>of</b> 12, <b>Alan</b> and his family immigrated to the United States.|$|R
50|$|Aetius sent {{large numbers}} <b>of</b> <b>Alans</b> to both Armorica and Galicia {{following}} {{the defeat of}} Attila at the Battle of the Catalunian Plains. The Alans evidently assimilated quickly into the local Celtic cultures, contributing their own legends, e.g. to the Arthurian Cycle of romances.|$|R
25|$|In any case, Goar's Alans are universally {{identified}} with the group <b>of</b> <b>Alans</b> near Orléans, who helped repel Attila's invasion in 451, and who were led at that time by Sangiban—putting the end of Goar's reign, if the identification with Eochar is accepted, somewhere between 446 and 450.|$|R
5|$|The Butler Stand {{roof was}} blown {{off in a}} storm in January 1976. The ground damage meant the club's next home game against Middlesbrough had to be played at Vale Park, the home of local rivals Port Vale. The repair bill, {{in the region of}} £250,000, put the club in {{financial}} trouble, which was eased by the sale <b>of</b> <b>Alan</b> Hudson, Mike Pejic and Jimmy Greenhoff for a combined sum of £440,000. With the team depleted, relegation proved inevitable in the 1976–77 season. Waddington, after a spell of 17 years in charge, left the club after a 1–0 home defeat in March 1977.|$|E
5|$|The {{available}} sources give no {{clue as to}} Albin's {{pattern of}} allegiance in these factional politics, and neither do his recorded activities. Professor Donald Watt has suggested that Albin was probably aligned with the Durward faction, in contrast, for instance, to the allegedly Comyn aligned Clement of Dunblane. Watt even argued that Albin's postulation was {{probably due to the}} influence <b>of</b> <b>Alan</b> Durward, who at the time was a close advisor of King Alexander II.|$|E
5|$|Waddington was {{presented}} with a dilemma as both George Eastham and Peter Dobing retired {{not long after the}} club's League Cup win. Waddington responded by paying £240,000 to Chelsea for the services <b>of</b> <b>Alan</b> Hudson in early 1974. This was followed by Geoff Salmons' arrival from Sheffield United for £160,000, in the same year. Waddington later paid a world record fee for a goalkeeper, £325,000, to sign Peter Shilton from Leicester City. The new personnel brought added impetus to Waddington's side, and Stoke were close to winning the League title in 1974–75, but an end of season slump led to a fifth-place finish, four points off the champions, Derby.|$|E

5000|$|Gretchen Hartman (Chicago, August 28, 1897 - Los Angeles, January 27, 1979) was an American {{stage and}} film actress.

50|$|In 418 (or 426 {{according}} to some authors), the Alan king, Attaces, was killed in battle against the Visigoths, and this branch <b>of</b> the <b>Alans</b> subsequently appealed to the Asding Vandal king Gunderic to accept the Alan crown. The separate ethnic identity <b>of</b> Respendial's <b>Alans</b> dissolved. Although some <b>of</b> these <b>Alans</b> {{are thought to have}} remained in Iberia, most went to North Africa with the Vandals in 429. Later the rulers of the Vandal Kingdom in North Africa styled themselves Rex Wandalorum et Alanorum ("King of the Vandals and Alans").|$|R
5|$|Alice in Wonderland is a 2010 American fantasy {{adventure}} film {{directed by}} Tim Burton from a screenplay written by Linda Woolverton. The film stars Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway, Helena Bonham Carter, Crispin Glover, Matt Lucas, and Mia Wasikowska and features the voices <b>of</b> <b>Alan</b> Rickman, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, and Timothy Spall. Based on Lewis Carroll's fantasy novels, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. This film {{tells the story}} of a nineteen-year-old Alice Kingsleigh (stated in the film to be a daughter of Charles Kingsley), who is told that she can restore the White Queen to her throne, with the help of the Mad Hatter. She is the only one who can slay the Jabberwock, a dragon-like creature that is controlled by the Red Queen and terrorizes Underland's inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Allied to John de Courcy, Donnchadh fought {{battles in}} Ireland and {{acquired}} land {{there that he}} subsequently lost. A patron of religious houses, particularly Melrose Abbey and North Berwick priory nunnery, he attempted to establish a monastery in his own territory, at Crossraguel. He married the daughter <b>of</b> <b>Alan</b> fitz Walter, a leading {{member of the family}} later known as the House of Stewart—future monarchs of Scotland and England. Donnchadh was the first mormaer or earl of Carrick, a region he ruled for more than six decades, making him one of the longest serving magnates in medieval Scotland. His descendants include the Bruce and Stewart Kings of Scotland, and probably the Campbell Dukes of Argyll.|$|E
5|$|As he {{nears the}} cabin, the {{imaginary}} Barry appears and tells Alan {{that he will}} have to reject all the illusions before he can face off against the insane version <b>of</b> <b>Alan,</b> including the apparition of Barry. Alan is ready to accept that, forcing Alan to fight Taken illusions of Dr. Hartman, Barry, and the Andersons, defeating them all before he is able to reenter the cabin. His crazed side is in a paranoid state on the cabin floor, and when Alan touches him, the two are made whole again. Alan realizes that he cannot let himself fall into a delusional state again for fear of never being able to escape, and returns to the typewriter to start a new story—"Return".|$|E
50|$|Respendial {{was king}} {{of one of}} two groups <b>of</b> <b>Alans</b> which crossed the Rhine into the Roman Empire in 407 CE. The other group was led by Goar, who joined the Romans; Respendial allied himself instead to the Vandals, whom he aided in a battle against the Franks after the Vandal king Godigisel was slain. Along with the Siling and Asding Vandals and a group <b>of</b> Sueves, Respendial's <b>Alans</b> crossed Gaul and settled in Hispania in 409.|$|R
