There are instances, however, where the novel contradicts its own agenda. The central argument of this paper is that while Mootoo makes good on undermining heterosexual privilege and subverting entrenched binary constructions of gender and sexual identity, this is limited as far as the novel, at times, rather than challenging hegemonic modes of belonging, ossifies them.

40|$|AbstractCrucial for the {{perception}} of form are the spatial relationships between {{the elements of a}} visual stimulus. To investigate the mechanisms involved in coding the distance between visual stimuli, thresholds for detecting whether a central marker accurately bisects a spatial interval were compared for a variety of configurations. Thresholds are best when all three members of the bisection configuration are identical. Performance is impaired, often by as much as a factor of two, when the outer delimiters of the spatial interval differ from the central marker in either length, orientation or contrast polarity. Illusory contours act poorly as borders for bisection by a central line. Disparity thresholds are not affected by orientation differences between test and flanking lines. Because in peripheral vision bisection acuity improves with practice, transfer of training between configurations can be used to gauge overlap of neural processing mechanisms. Transfer is complete only between patterns where all markers are similar, reduced when the <b>outer</b> <b>markers</b> differ by 20 ° in orientation and absent when they are orthogonal. The dependence of bisection discrimination on similarity between the elements of the stimulus demonstrates that the encoding of spatial location and spatial extent are coupled to the coding of other stimulus propertie...|$|R
40|$|In {{a recent}} article Gensler (2003) has argued that little {{can be said about}} the {{ordering}} of bound person markers of the T(heme) and R(ecipient) relative to each other or relative to the verb stem apart {{from the fact that the}} <b>outer</b> <b>markers</b> are likely to be the result of a second-level cliticization process. We take issue with this claim and document that quite successful predictions with respect to the ordering of the T and R markers can be made on the basis of morphological alignment. Taking as our point of departure the typology of ditransitive alignment outlined in Haspelmath (2004; 2005), we show that the ordering patterns in which the R is placed closer to the verbal stem than the T are favoured in all relevant alignment types apart from the indirective, which exhibits a preference for positioning the T closer to the verbal stem than the R. These preferences for the ordering of the R and T are argued to relate directly to the frequency of use of the relative person forms and thus are seen as constituting yet another piece of evidence for the usage-based model of grammar being developed within the functional-cognitive typological paradigm (cf. e. g.

Nagarse under the same conditions, however, greatly decreased the malonyl-CoA inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase activity, the high-affinity binding of malonyl-CoA to mitochondria, and the ability of malonyl-CoA to shift to the right the sigmoid activity curve of carnitine palmitoyltransferase observed with variations in palmitoyl-CoA concentration. No noticeable effect of Nagarse pretreatment was observed on the binding of octanoyl-CoA to mitochondria.

Instead of being herded into the formal armies of the Confederacy and the Union, these young, white, southern-sympathizing men looked to antebellum models of manhood - both southern and western - to retain their independence while defending slavery and their families. Women, full partners in the war effort, produced clothing and food for their men, and provided them with emotional support, all of which allowed the guerrillas to strike out into the brush where they waged a frontier style war. As the war evolved, so too did the gender system that established roles for men and women. Not only did women find themselves performing the tasks of men and standing up to the enemy, but the masculine identity of white men proved to be much more fluid than previously thought. Rather than stubbornly standing their ground, guerrilla-men ran, hid, and avoided confrontations with enemy men only to strike when the backs of Union men were turned. By better understanding these men, we can better understand the war they chose to wage, and hopefully, the nature of war more generally...|$|R

40|$|In the {{vertebrate}} retina, {{the formation}} of neural circuits within discrete laminae is critical {{for the establishment of}} retinal visual function. Precise formation of retinal circuits requires the coordinated actions of adhesive and repulsive molecules, including repulsive transmembrane semaphorins (Sema 6 A, Sema 5 A, and Sema 5 B). These semaphorins signal through different Plexin A (PlexA) receptors, thereby regulating distinct aspects of retinal circuit assembly. Here, we investigate the physiological roles of three Class 6 transmembrane semaphorins (Sema 6 B, Sema 6 C, and Sema 6 D), previously identified as PlexA receptor ligands in non-retinal tissues, in mammalian retinal development.

However, we do not observe defects in stereotypical lamina-specific neurite stratification of retinal neuron subtypes in Sema 6 B-/- or Sema 6 C-/-; Sema 6 D-/- retinas. These findings indicate these Class 6 transmembrane semaphorins are unlikely to serve as major PlexA receptor ligands for the assembly of murine retinal circuit laminar organization...|$|R
40|$|Preparations enriched with plasmalemmal, outer mitochondrial, or Golgi complex {{membranes}} from rat liver were subfractionated by isopycnic centrifugation, without {{or after}} treatment with digitonin, {{to establish the}} subcellular distribution {{of a variety of}} enzymes. The typical plasmalemmal enzymes 5 '-nucleotidase, alkaline phosphodiesterase I, and alkaline phosphatase were markedly shifted by digitonin toward higher densities in all three preparations. Three glycosyltransferases, highly purified in the Golgi fraction, were moderately shifted by digitonin in both this Golgi complex preparation and the microsomal fraction. The <b>outer</b> mitochondrial membrane <b>marker,</b> monoamine oxidase, was not affected by digitonin in the <b>outer</b> mitochondrial membrane <b>marker,</b> monoamine oxidase, was not affected by digitonin in the out mitochondrial membrane preparation, in agreement wit its behavior in microsomes. With the exception of NADH cytochrome c reductase (which was concentrated in the outer mitochondrial membrane preparation), typical microsomal enzymes (glucose- 6 -phosphatase, esterase, and NADPH cytochrome c reductase) displayed low specific activities in the three preparations; except for part of the glucose- 6 -phosphatase activity in the plasma membrane preparation, their density distributions were insensitive to digitonin, as they were in microsomes. The influence of digitonin on equilibrium densities was correlated with its morphological effects. Digitonin induced pseudofenestrations in plasma membranes. In Golgi and outer mitochondrial membrane preparations, a few similarly altered membranes were detected in subfractions enriched with 5 '-nucleotidase and alkaline phosphodiesterase I. The alterations of Golgi membranes were less obvious and seemingly restricted to some elements in the Golgi preparation. No morphological modification was detected in digitonin-treated outer mitochondrial membranes. These results indicate that each enzyme is associated with the same membrane entity in all membrane preparations and support the view that there is little overlap in the enzymatic equipment of the various types of cytomembranes...|$|R
