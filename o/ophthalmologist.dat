40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to study the {{practice}} pattern, personal profile, and work-family balance of male and female <b>ophthalmologists</b> in India. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted through 41 point questionnaire sent to the members of All India Ophthalmological Society dealing with practice profile and personal circumstances of <b>ophthalmologists.</b> Results: Six hundred and twenty-two (8 %) responses were obtained out of 7723 invitations sent. A total of 452 were male and 170 were female <b>ophthalmologists.</b> Age group of 30 - 39 years was most common age of respondents (male 155; 35. 3 %; female 81; 47. 6 %). Larger number of male <b>ophthalmologists</b> (157; 34. 7 %) worked for more than 9 h a day than female <b>ophthalmologists</b> (41; 24. 1 %) (P = 0. 01). Larger number of male <b>ophthalmologists</b> (229; 50. 7 %) earned more than Rs. 1 lakh/month than female <b>ophthalmologists</b> (55; 32. 4 %) (P = 0. 00001) More female <b>ophthalmologists</b> (21; 12. 4 %) than males (26; 5. 8 %) said that they faced cultural, ethnic or gender bias at work place (P = 0. 002). Forty-four (25. 9 %) female and 54 (12 %) male <b>ophthalmologists</b> said that they often curtailed their work for family needs (P = 0. 0001). Two hundred and fifty-two (55. 8 %) male <b>ophthalmologists</b> and 78 (45. 9 %) female <b>ophthalmologists</b> considered their profession rewarding (P = 0. 02). Conclusion: Ophthalmology as a profession was considered rewarding by both male and female <b>ophthalmologists.</b> However, female <b>ophthalmologists</b> were curtailing their work for family needs and earning less than male <b>ophthalmologists.</b> Female <b>ophthalmologists</b> were also subject to gender bias at workplace.

Data were collected from the Bureau of National Health Insurance of Taiwan, the Bulletin of the Taiwan Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Society, and the Statistics Yearbook of Practicing Physicians and Health Care Organizations in Taiwan by the Taiwan Medical Association. We ascertained that 94 <b>ophthalmologists</b> were oculoplastic surgeons and accounted for 5. 8 % of 1621 <b>ophthalmologists</b> in Taiwan. They had their fellowship training abroad (most <b>ophthalmologists</b> trained in the United States of America) or in Taiwan.

Methods: As part of a prospective, multinational, non-interventional cohort study in 13 countries in Europe between 2006 and 2012, <b>ophthalmologists</b> completed the Baseline Questionnaire and the Follow-up Questionnaire 1  year after baseline. Results and discussion: Of the 125 <b>ophthalmologists</b> {{who participated in the}} study, 113 (90. 4 %) completed the Baseline Questionnaire. Most of these <b>ophthalmologists</b> were medical retina specialists (43. 0 %). The median number of IVT injections that the <b>ophthalmologists</b> performed per month during the year prior to completing the Baseline Questionnaire was 20. 0. The majority of the <b>ophthalmologists</b> had performed their last IVT injection prior to completing the questionnaire in an operating room or theater (68. 4 %). When performing IVT injections, a majority of the <b>ophthalmologists</b> reported applying povidone–iodine (90. 4 %) before IVT injections and topical antibiotics right after IVT injections (89. 5 %). In addition, 81. 6 % of the <b>ophthalmologists</b> reported using a sterile adhesive eye drape and 80. 7 % reported using an eyelid speculum. In all, 95 <b>ophthalmologists</b> (76 %) completed the Follow-up Questionnaire. The median number of IVT injections performed per month during the year prior to completing the Follow-up Questionnaire by these <b>ophthalmologists</b> was increased to 35. The results of the Follow-up Questionnaire on administering IVT injections were {{similar to those of the}} Baseline Questionnaire. A majority of the <b>ophthalmologists</b> reported applying povidone–iodine (87. 4 %) before IVT injections, topical antibiotics right after IVT injections (89. 5 %), and an eyelid speculum (85. 3 %).

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} is to explore and compare the {{prevailing}} practice patterns in the diagnosis and management of glaucoma among subspecialists and general <b>ophthalmologists</b> in India. Materials and Methods: This is an interactive audience response system (ARS) based poll of <b>ophthalmologists</b> attending the annual conference of the Glaucoma Society of India in 2013. Results: The information was obtained from 379 <b>ophthalmologists</b> (146 glaucoma specialists, 54 nonglaucoma subspecialists, and 179 general <b>ophthalmologists).</b> The majority of polled <b>ophthalmologists</b> (236; 62 %) had 10 or more years of experience in ophthalmology. The glaucoma specialists differed from nonglaucomatologists in their preference for Goldmann applanation tonometer (P < 0. 01), four-mirror gonioscope (P < 0. 01), Humphrey perimeter (P < 0. 01), laser peripheral iridotomy in primary angle closure disease (P = 0. 03), postiridotomy gonioscopy (P < 0. 01), and usage of antifibrotic agents during filtering surgery (P < 0. 01). Optical coherence tomography was the most preferred imaging modality and was utilized more often by the subspecialists than general <b>ophthalmologists.</b> The <b>ophthalmologists</b> also differed in their choice of antiglaucoma medications. More glaucoma specialists were performing surgery on children with congenital glaucoma (P < 0. 01), implanting glaucoma drainage devices (P < 0. 01), and using scientific journals to upgrade knowledge (P = 0. 03) than the other <b>ophthalmologists.</b> Conclusions: This poll is the first of its kind in India, in its usage of the ARS, and in comparing the practice patterns of care for glaucoma among subspecialists and general <b>ophthalmologists.</b> It has revealed substantial diversity in a few areas among those who did and did not receive specialty training in glaucoma...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Convergence {{insufficiency}} (CI) is {{a common}} binocular vision disorder. However, {{there is a lack}} of consensus regarding the treatment most appropriate for CI. The aim of the study was to investigate the treatment for CI by surveying the <b>ophthalmologists</b> regarding the most common treatment modalities used in India. Materials and Methods: Four hundred questionnaires were distributed amongst <b>ophthalmologists</b> attending different sessions of the Delhi Ophthalmological Society annual conference held in April 2007. Two hundred and three <b>ophthalmologists</b> responded (response rate 50. 75 &#x 0025;). The responders included 109 private practitioners, 57 consultants attached to teaching institutes and 37 residents. Results: The majority of <b>ophthalmologists</b> (66. 7 &#x 0025;) claimed encountering&# 62; 5 &#x 0025; outpatient department patients with CI. Pencil push-ups therapy (PPT) was the most common first line of treatment offered by <b>ophthalmologists</b> (79 &#x 0025;) followed by synoptophore exercises (18 &#x 0025;). Only 3 &#x 0025; referred the patients to optometrists. Thirty per cent <b>ophthalmologists</b> claimed good results with PPT, which was significantly higher in private practitioners (35 &#x 0025;). Only 26 &#x 0025; <b>ophthalmologists</b> explained physiological diplopia to patients on a regular basis and reported significantly higher percentage of patients (46. 3 &#x 0025;) with good results. Only 12. 3 &#x 0025; <b>ophthalmologists</b> needed to refer&# 62; 30 &#x 0025; patients for synoptophore exercises. For failure of PPT 86. 7 &#x 0025; considered lack of compliance as the major reason as perceived by <b>ophthalmologists.</b> Conclusions: This survey suggested that most ophthalmic practitioners prescribed PPT as the initial treatment for CI and had satisfactory results with PPT.
