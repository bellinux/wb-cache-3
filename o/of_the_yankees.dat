5|$|Early in the 1934 season, Ruth openly campaigned {{to become}} the Yankees manager. However, the Yankee job was never a serious possibility.

Regular season games <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> were not broadcast until 1939, as management believed that fewer fans would attend games if they could listen on radios.|$|E
