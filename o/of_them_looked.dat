5|$|Aiyer sent Ramanujan, {{with letters}} of introduction, to his {{mathematician}} friends in Madras. Some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>looked</b> at {{his work and}} gave him letters of introduction to R. Ramachandra Rao, the district collector for Nellore {{and the secretary of}} the Indian Mathematical Society. Rao was impressed by Ramanujan's research but doubted that it was his own work. Ramanujan mentioned a correspondence he had with Professor Saldhana, a notable Bombay mathematician, in which Saldhana expressed a lack of understanding of his work but concluded that he was not a phony. Ramanujan's friend C. V. Rajagopalachari tried to quell Rao's doubts about Ramanujan's academic integrity. Rao agreed to give him another chance, and listened as Ramanujan discussed elliptic integrals, hypergeometric series, and his theory of divergent series, which Rao said ultimately converted him to a belief in Ramanujan's brilliance. When Rao asked him what he wanted, Ramanujan replied that he needed work and financial support. Rao consented and sent him to Madras. He continued his research, with Rao's financial aid taking care of his daily needs. With Aiyer's help, Ramanujan had his work published in the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society.|$|E
25|$|On the Fascist side, {{after the}} fall of Tunis and Pantelleria, it was clear to many that the war had been lost. The landing in Sicily and the lack of {{resistance}} shocked the Fascists, who asked themselves why the Duce was not reacting. Many <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>looked</b> to the King, and many at Mussolini. One big problem was to find an institution suitable for a political action.|$|E

2500|$|Lawry's men left {{directly}} for South Africa. Already tired, they confronted fast and bouncy pitches {{in contrast to}} low, slow and dusty spinning pitches in India. Upon arrival, Lawry declared Ian Chappell {{to be the best}} batsman in the world, something that would come back to haunt him. For his part, the Australian commentator Alan McGilvray said that when they arrived in Johannesburg, the Australians [...] "looked haggard. Their eyes seemed to be standing out of their heads and some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>looked</b> positively yellow." [...] The Australians played their first match of the tour within a week of leaving the subcontinent. Prior to this first match, most of the team were seen sleeping on the benches at the ground half an hour before play was due to start. Initially, it appeared that the Australians were unaffected by the long campaign and change in conditions; they won their first two lead-in matches against their provincial sides by an innings and ten wickets respectively, Lawry scoring 86 against North Eastern Transvaal and 157 against Griqualand West, finishing unbeaten on both occasions. They drew the third match against Eastern Province, Lawry again unbeaten twice on 9 and 43.|$|E
2500|$|Hollywood Research Inc. {{was the new}} intelligence-gathering {{front of}} Confidential, run by Marjorie Meade, Robert Harrison's now 26-year-old niece. Despite her youth and {{red-headed}} beauty, {{she was the one}} of the most feared persons in Hollywood since her arrival in January 1955. John Mitchum, the younger brother of Robert Mitchum, described a visit to Fred Otash, where he was taken to [...] "a ground floor apartment in a luxury apartment building in Beverley Hills, the offices, it turned out, of Hollywood Research Inc., command central for Confidentials fact-gathering and surveillance agents. The place was filled with big, tough looking guys, and some <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>looked</b> like they were packing heat.

[...] The Harrison enterprise had evolved into a [...] "quasi-blackmail operation." [...] Once a proposed story was assembled, it could be published outright.

Their attorney was Jerry Giesler, who also represented heiress Doris Duke.|$|E
