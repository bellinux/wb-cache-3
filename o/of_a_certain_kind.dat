Poets treated her either as an {{individual}} {{or at least as}} the type <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>certain</b> <b>kind</b> of woman. The French poet Albert Glatigny addresses “Circé” in his Les vignes folles (1857) and makes of her a voluptuous opium dream, the magnet of masochistic fantasies. Louis-Nicolas Ménard's sonnet in Rêveries d'un païen mystique (1876) describes her as enchanting all with her virginal look, but appearance belies the accursed reality. Poets in English were not far behind in this lurid portrayal. Lord de Tabley's [...] "Circe" [...] (1895) is a thing of decadent perversity likened to a tulip, ‘A flaunting bloom, naked and undivine... With freckled cheeks and splotch’d side serpentine, A gipsy among flowers’. That central image is echoed by the blood-striped flower of T.S.Eliot's student poem “Circe’s Palace" [...] (1909) in the Harvard Advocate. Circe herself does not appear, her character is suggested by what is in the grounds and the beasts in the forest beyond: panthers, pythons, and peacocks that ‘look at us with the eyes of men whom we knew long ago’. Rather than a temptress, she has become an emasculatory threat.|$|E
