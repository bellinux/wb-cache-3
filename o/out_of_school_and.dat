The group's turnout on Amateur Night resulted in three consecutive wins and a cash prize, after which, upon returning home to Richmond, D'Angelo was inspired to produce his own album and began composing material.|$|E

50|$|Factors such as {{the cost}} of running a {{household}} have also affected literacy through American history. Research into family economics shows “how the interplay between early industrial wage structures and family demographics may have forced children from working-class families <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> into factories.” In limiting the learning potential of these children, economics serves as a sponsor of literacy, though not a benevolent one.|$|R

25|$|With the war's ever {{increasing}} need for able bodied men consuming America's labor {{force in the}} early 1940s, industry turned to teen-aged boys and girls to fill in as replacements.

Between 1940 and 1944, the number of teenage workers increased by 1.9 million, {{and the number of}} students in public high schools dropped from 6.6 million in 1940 to 5.6 million in 1944, as a million students—and many teachers—took jobs.|$|E
