5|$|Elsewhere, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) {{performs}} a <b>one-man</b> <b>show</b> on Broadway {{so that he}} can be considered for a Tony Award as part of his EGOT quest. His show receives positive reviews, and Tracy is convinced that he will win a Tony, but Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) tells him that in order for him to qualify for the award he must do his <b>one-man</b> <b>show</b> eight times, which worries Tracy, as he is unable to perform anything the same way twice. Despite initial reluctance to help him, Jenna eventually agrees to coach Tracy in the principles of acting, but this leads nowhere, resulting in the two arguing and Jenna telling him he can go on his show and read the phone book for all she cares. At the end of the episode, Tracy does read the phone book at his show, making Jenna very proud of him, and inexplicably drawing high praise from the audience.|$|E
