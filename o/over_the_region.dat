5|$|Signed on June 15, 1846, the Oregon Treaty {{ended the}} {{dispute between the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the United States, by {{dividing}} the Oregon Country at the 49th parallel.

Two years later, on August 14, 1848, the United States Congress created the Oregon Territory; this territory included today's states of Oregon, Washington, and Idaho, and parts of Montana and Wyoming. Appointed Governor of the Oregon Territory by President Polk, Joseph Lane arrived at Oregon City on 2 March 1849.|$|E

40|$|The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) is a {{panchromatic}} {{visible and}} near-infrared band capable of quantitative measurement of light radiances from 3 × 10 - 9 W∙cm- 2 ∙sr- 1 to 2 × 10 - 2 W∙cm- 2 ∙sr- 1. Its extreme {{sensitivity of the}} HGS to low lights, together with the nearly constant spatial resolution <b>over</b> <b>the</b> whole swath, enables numerous applications of environmental remote sensing and global monitoring of anthropogenic activities in nighttime. However, the DNB is susceptible to high energy particles (HEPs) hitting <b>over</b> <b>the</b> South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region. Although a special algorithm was designed to filter out high radiance pixels induced by HEPs, large amount of artificial bright pixels are still observed in the generated DNB nighttime images, leaving obstacles for several image based applications, such as automatic fishing boat detection <b>over</b> <b>the</b> SAA <b>region.</b> In this study, we investigated DNB nighttime images <b>over</b> <b>the</b> SAA <b>region.</b> It {{has been shown that}} the DNB gain selection logic is the possible root cause for the isolated bright pixels in DNB nighttime images <b>over</b> <b>the</b> SAA <b>region.</b> This result was confirmed by a recent DNB special data acquisition <b>over</b> <b>the</b> SAA <b>region.</b> With <b>the</b> knowledge acquired from the analysis of root cause, we explored method to eliminate artificial bright pixels induced by <b>the</b> HEPs <b>over</b> <b>the</b> SAA <b>region.</b> Our method could improve the DNB nighttime image quality <b>over</b> <b>the</b> SAA <b>region</b> and potentially benefits monitoring of anthropogenic activities in nighttime over that region...|$|R
