5|$|As {{early as}} 16 April, the German command {{realised}} that the British were evacuating troops on ships at Volos and Piraeus. The campaign then took <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of a pursuit. For the Germans, {{it was now}} primarily a question of maintaining contact with the retreating British forces and foiling their evacuation plans.

The 2nd and 5th Panzer Divisions, the 1st SS Motorised Infantry Regiment and both mountain divisions launched a pursuit of the Allied forces.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Hartman was {{preparing}} to voice Zapp Brannigan, a character written specifically for him on Groening's second animated series Futurama. Even though the role was made for Hartman, he still insisted on auditioning and according to Groening, he 'nailed it'. After Hartman's death, Futuramas lead character Philip J. Fry was named in his honour, and Billy West took over the role of Brannigan. Though executive producer David X. Cohen credits West with using his own take <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>character,</b> West later said that he purposely tweaked Zapp's voice to better match Hartman's intended portrayal. Hartman was also planning to appear with Lovitz in the indie film The Day of Swine and Roses, scheduled to begin production in August 1998.|$|E

5|$|Bayona {{cut parts}} of the script, {{including}} {{the outcome of the}} other orphanage children, because he wanted to focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of Laura and what happens to her. To create the film as he wanted, Bayona had to double both the film's budget and the amount of filming time. To accomplish this, Bayona received help from fellow film director Guillermo del Toro, whom he had met at Festival de Cine de Sitges when del Toro was presenting his film Cronos (1993). Del Toro offered to co-produce the film as soon as he learned about it. For the rest of his crew, Bayona worked with his regular team that he worked with on commercials and music videos.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier {{was a great}} {{admirer of}} Spanish author Miguel de Cervantes, having cited him {{in a number of}} {{different}} texts throughout his career. The Prologue begins with a quote from Cervantes' Los trabajos de Persiles y Sigismunda (Persiles and Sigismunda), which is subsequently mentioned, with a focus <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> of Rutilio. The mention of Rutilio is noteworthy, as the episode has been of interest to critics due to its magical subject matter, concerning lycanthropy. Both works feature a distant and exotic land where the marvellous is present by means of metamorphoses, and viewed from the characters' perspective.|$|E

His enigmatic depth in the sequel, D.Gray-man Hallow, was also praised. A variety of merchandise based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>character</b> has been released.|$|E
