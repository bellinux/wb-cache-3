5|$|As already described, chiral liquid-crystal {{molecules}} usually {{give rise}} to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a stereogenic center. An additional requirement is that the system not be racemic: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, {{a small amount of}} chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.|$|E
5|$|On 18 July, Casares Quiroga refused {{an offer}} of help from the CNT and UGT, proclaiming that nowhere outside Spanish Morocco had joined the rebels and that the populace should trust legal methods {{to deal with the}} uprising. Handing out weapons would be illegal. The CNT and UGT proclaimed a general strike, in effect mobilising. They opened weapons caches, some buried since the 1934 risings. The {{paramilitary}} forces, better trained than the army, often waited to see the outcome of militia action before either joining or suppressing the rebellion. Quick action by either the rebels or anarchist militias was <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> decide the fate of a town. General Queipo de Llano managed to secure Seville for the rebels, arresting a number of other officers.|$|E
5|$|The {{roughness}} of {{this version}} succeeded {{in a way}} the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished. It was a rare moment, one that true performers strive for and don't find <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> satisfy themselves.|$|E

5|$|Like other lanthanides, many isotopes, {{especially}} isotopes with odd mass {{numbers and}} neutron-poor isotopes like 152Eu, have high cross sections for neutron capture, <b>often</b> high <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be neutron poisons.|$|R
25|$|The {{distribution}} of the n-th digit, as n increases, rapidly approaches a uniform distribution with 10% {{for each of the}} ten digits, as shown below. Four digits is <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> assume a uniform {{distribution of}} 10% as '0' appears 10.0176% of the time in the fourth digit while '9' appears 9.9824% of the time.|$|E
25|$|Some special integrands occur <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> warrant special study. In particular, it may {{be useful}} to have, in the set of antiderivatives, the special {{functions}} (like the Legendre functions, the hypergeometric function, the gamma function, the incomplete gamma function and so on— see Symbolic integration for more details). Extending the Risch's algorithm to include such functions is possible but challenging and has been an active research subject.|$|E
25|$|Tinamous are avid bathers. During {{heavy rain}} they may stand erect with their bill {{pointing}} skyward allowing the rain to wash over them. They will dust-bathe at regular intervals, {{and have been}} known to dust-bathe <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> tint themselves the same color as the soil. They also sunbathe, and will do so while resting on one leg with an outstretched wing. Defecation for a tinamou is a slightly involved task as it must move aside the dense plumage that surrounds the cloaca to avoid soiling itself. Captive tinamous defecate once daily.|$|E

50|$|Load is <b>often</b> large <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> {{influence}} the market outcome by varying the quantity they bid into the DA market. Virtual bidding mitigates this power by allowing other market participants to simply bid in the load that was under-scheduled.|$|R
25|$|More recently, {{democracy}} is criticised for not offering enough political stability. As governments are frequently elected {{on and off}} there tends to be frequent changes in the policies of democratic countries both domestically and internationally. Even if a political party maintains power, vociferous, headline grabbing protests and harsh criticism from the popular media are <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> force sudden, unexpected political change. Frequent policy changes with regard to business and immigration are likely to deter investment and so hinder economic growth. For this reason, many people have put forward the idea that {{democracy is}} undesirable for a developing country in which economic growth and the reduction of poverty are top priorities.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} on-field {{incidents}} grew {{and after a}} particularly difficult game during 1935, newspaper cartoonist John Ludlow in The Age drew a picture of Dyer as a pirate and a journalist nicknamed him 'Captain Blood', after the Errol Flynn film Captain Blood. Initially, Dyer was angry at the connotation and the implied slur on his sportsmanship. Dyer preferred the 'hip and shoulder' method of meeting an opponent rather than grabbing him in a tackle. The force of being hit by the athletic, 89kg frame of Dyer was <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> leave a player prostrate {{and not wanting to}} re-enter the fray for a while. Occasionally, the hip and shoulder could go awry and Dyer's forearm would come into play, which was a reportable offence. In a nineteen-year career, he was reported five times and suspended once.|$|E
25|$|Control over Spanish Morocco {{was all but}} certain. The {{plan was}} {{discovered}} in Morocco on 17 July, which prompted the conspirators to enact it immediately. Little resistance was encountered. In total, the rebels shot 189 people. Goded and Franco immediately {{took control of the}} islands to which they were assigned. On 18 July, Casares Quiroga refused an offer of help from the CNT and Unión General de Trabajadores (UGT), leading the groups to proclaim a general strike—in effect, mobilizing. They opened weapons caches, some buried since the 1934 risings. The paramilitary security forces often waited to see the outcome of militia action before either joining or suppressing the rebellion. Quick action by either the rebels or anarchist militias was <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> decide the fate of a town.

25|$|Superhuman Strength: In human form, Michael is able {{to fully}} stop a truck that had just {{initiated}} its brakes, can break steel chains and rip a first aid kit box from a wall. When changed to his Hybrid form, Michael's strength increases significantly. He holds his ground against Viktor, a centuries-old Vampire Elder, in physical combat immediately following the transformation, taking the Elder by surprise with his incredible speed and strength before ultimately falling prey to Viktor's much greater combat experience and superior battle technique. Although Michael {{is one of the}} most physically powerful beings of the series, his lack of combat experience tends to put him at a disadvantage when facing particularly experienced combatants, though his raw strength, speed and rage is <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> compensate for this when facing the average Vampire or Lycan; Viktor is the only non-Hybrid being that Michael couldn't defeat due to Viktor's vast combat experience as an Elder Vampire. He can also punch through a Werewolf's chest with ease. His strength is so great that he {{is able to}} kill William, the first Werewolf in existence (who had been weakened by centuries without sustenance), by tearing his head in half with his bare hands, despite having recently recovered from being impaled by Markus. He also holds his own against another Hybrid, Markus, despite the latter's status as the eldest of the Vampires.|$|E
25|$|The variable-opt {{method is}} related to, and a {{generalization}} of the k-opt method. Whereas the k-opt methods remove a fixed number (k) of edges {{from the original}} tour, the variable-opt methods do not fix {{the size of the}} edge set to remove. Instead they grow the set as the search process continues. The best known method in this family is the Lin–Kernighan method (mentioned above as a misnomer for 2-opt). Shen Lin and Brian Kernighan first published their method in 1972, and it was the most reliable heuristic for solving travelling salesman problems for nearly two decades. More advanced variable-opt methods were developed at Bell Labs in the late 1980s by David Johnson and his research team. These methods (sometimes called Lin–Kernighan–Johnson) build on the Lin–Kernighan method, adding ideas from tabu search and evolutionary computing. The basic Lin–Kernighan technique gives results that are guaranteed to be at least 3-opt. The Lin–Kernighan–Johnson methods compute a Lin–Kernighan tour, and then perturb the tour by what {{has been described as a}} mutation that removes at least four edges and reconnecting the tour in a different way, then V-opting the new tour. The mutation is <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> move the tour from the local minimum identified by Lin–Kernighan. V-opt methods are widely considered the most powerful heuristics for the problem, and are able to address special cases, such as the Hamilton Cycle Problem and other non-metric TSPs that other heuristics fail on. For many years Lin–Kernighan–Johnson had identified optimal solutions for all TSPs where an optimal solution was known and had identified the best known solutions for all other TSPs on which the method had been tried.|$|E

50|$|Some velomobile {{fairings}} {{are mainly}} for weather protection. However, if the velomobile fairing is substaintally streamlined, then improved aerodynamics means the speeds on flats and down hills may be substantially higher than its unfaired counterpart, and <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> faster <b>to</b> {{make up for}} the slower climbing due to weight.|$|R
50|$|Criminals {{are less}} likely to carry {{firearms}} due to United Kingdom gun laws, and the presence of an armed officer can <b>often</b> be <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> negotiate their surrender. The Thames Valley Police has only used a firearm against a suspect once in its entire history.|$|R
50|$|Both {{conditional}} {{power and}} predictive power use statistical significance as success criteria. However statistical significance is <b>often</b> not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> define success. For example, health authorities often require {{the magnitude of}} treatment effect to be bigger than statistical significance to support a registration decision.|$|R
500|$|While ironclads spread {{rapidly in}} navies worldwide, {{there were few}} pitched naval battles {{involving}} ironclads. Most European nations settled differences on land, and the Royal Navy struggled to maintain a deterrent parity with at least France, while providing suitable protection to Britain's commerce and colonial outposts worldwide. [...] Ironclads remained, for the British Royal Navy, a matter of defending the British Isles first and projecting power abroad second. [...] Those naval engagements of {{the latter half of}} the 19th century which involved ironclads normally involved colonial actions or clashes between second-rate naval powers. [...] But these encounters were <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> convince British policy-makers of the increasing hazards of strictly naval foreign intervention, from Hampton Roads in the American Civil War to the hardening combined defences of naval arsenals such as Kronstadt and Cherbourg.|$|E
500|$|Li criticized Capcom for not {{providing}} an easy alternative to unlock characters since the multiple Arcade mode playthroughs needed to unlock {{them could be}} frustrating. Nintendo World Report's Neal Ronaghan mentioned it can get tedious, and echoing Li's sentiment, Ryan Scott of GameSpy complained that [...] "arcade mode needs {{to be left to}} die," [...] as multiplayer is the primary reason for playing fighting games. Both Scott and Ramsay thought many of the other unlockables obtainable through Arcade mode didn't offer sufficient value. Reviewers had mixed experiences with its online component; GameDaily's Robert Workman reported that it ran fluidly, but Scott said that the game lagged <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be unplayable. Edwards thought [...] "the netcode hasn't shown itself to be particularly sturdy," [...] but the situation may improve as the number of local players increase. Both Bozon and GameTrailers said that performance depends on each player's connection; the latter explained that lag is more likely to occur when playing against a distant opponent.|$|E

A bishop and knight are worth roughly a rook and a pawn, and a queen {{is worth a}} rook, a [...] (bishop or knight) and a pawn (see Chess piece {{relative}} value).

50|$|They were <b>often</b> small <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be {{operated}} by hand, {{and were not}} normally self-propelled, instead requiring {{the use of a}} shunting engine to move them into position. Once cheap road-going mobile cranes were available, these superseded the rail-mounted variety due to their greater flexibility and mobility.|$|R
50|$|The spot {{patterns}} on the backs are <b>often</b> distinctive <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> use for population estimation using capture and recapture techniques.

2500|$|The entire Augustan age's poetry was {{dominated}} by Alexander Pope. [...] His lines were repeated <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> lend quite a few clichés and proverbs to modern English usage. [...] Pope had few poetic rivals, but he had many personal enemies and political, philosophical, or religious opponents, and Pope himself was quarrelsome in print. [...] Pope and his enemies (often called [...] "the Dunces" [...] because of Pope's successful satirizing of them in The Dunciad) fought over central matters of the proper subject matter for poetry and the proper pose of the poetic voice.|$|E

2500|$|In the Fourth Test at Sydney, England took {{a series}} lead with a 299-run win {{after taking a}} 106-run first innings lead and setting Australia 415 for victory. Lawry's critics became more vocal, despite a defiant unbeaten 60 {{carrying}} his bat as Australia collapsed and fell for 116 in the second innings. It was England's largest victory in terms of runs over Australia for 34 years. His own batting saw him described by Ian Wooldridge as [...] "a corpse with pads on". According to Ray Robinson, Lawry [...] "appeared to be expecting the worst and getting it <b>often</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> expect more of the same". The selectors responded by axing both of Australia's frontline pace duo of McKenzie and Connolly for the Fifth Test.|$|E
50|$|Some {{sports cars}} are {{released}} to the public {{for the express purpose of}} meeting the homologation guidelines of a particular series or several series.
