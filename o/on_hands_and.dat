25|$|The nail {{is often}} {{considered}} an impermeable barrier, {{but this is}} not true. In fact, it is much more permeable than the skin, and the composition of the nail includes 7–12% water. This permeability has implications for penetration by harmful and medicinal substances; in particular cosmetics applied to the nails can pose a risk. Water can penetrate the nail as can many other substances including paraquat, a fast acting herbicide that is harmful to humans, urea which is often an ingredient in creams and lotions meant for use <b>on</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> fingers, and several fungicidal agents such as salicylic acid, miconazole branded Monistat, natamycin; and sodium hypochlorite which is the active ingredient in common household bleach (but usually only in 2–3% concentration).|$|E

The number of digits <b>on</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> feet became standardized at five, as lineages with more digits died out. Thus, those very few tetrapod fossils {{found in this}} [...] "gap" [...] are all the more prized by palaeontologists because they document these significant changes and clarify their history.|$|E

500|$|The gills are adnate (with gills broadly {{attached}} to the stem, slightly above {{the bottom of the}} gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem) or slightly rounded next to the stem. The individual gills are close to subdistant, with between 10–14 reaching the stem, and two or three tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not reach the stem). The gills are moderately broad, pale orange to whitish, often yellowish at the base and whitish along the edges. The stem is [...] long, and up to 1mm thick; flexuous (winding from side to side), brittle, with the base covered with sharp, straight, and stiff white hairs. The surface is densely white-pruinose initially, but soon becomes naked with a subsequent color shift to orange-yellow or lemon yellow. This species has been described as [...] "a delight to behold", but [...] "one usually has to get down <b>on</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees to find it!" ...|$|E
2500|$|There are {{significant}} advantages to assuming an upright position in labor and birth, such as {{stronger and more}} efficient uterine contractions aiding cervical dilatation, increased pelvic inlet and outlet diameters and improved uterine contractility.

2500|$|Zoologists often label behaviors, {{including}} bipedalism, as [...] "facultative" [...] (i.e. optional) or [...] "obligate" [...] (the animal has no reasonable alternative). Even {{this distinction}} {{is not completely}} clear-cut — for example, humans other than infants normally walk and run in biped fashion, but almost all can crawl <b>on</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees when necessary. There are even reports of humans who normally walk on all fours with their feet but not their knees on the ground, but these cases {{are a result of}} conditions such as Uner Tan syndrome — very rare genetic neurological disorders rather than normal behavior. Even if one ignores exceptions caused by some kind of injury or illness, there are many unclear cases, including the fact that [...] "normal" [...] humans can crawl <b>on</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees. This article therefore avoids the terms [...] "facultative" [...] and [...] "obligate", and focuses on the range of styles of locomotion normally used by various groups of animals.|$|E

2500|$|Nationalists in {{the years}} after World War I thought of {{themselves}} as combating the both liberal and domineering institutions created by cabinets—such as those of Giovanni Giolitti, including traditional schooling. Futurism, a revolutionary cultural movement which would serve as a catalyst for Fascism, argued for [...] "a school for physical courage and patriotism", as expressed by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti in 1919. Marinetti expressed his disdain for [...] "the by now prehistoric and troglodyte Ancient Greek and Latin courses", arguing for their replacement with exercise modelled on those of the Arditi soldiers (" [...] to advance <b>on</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees in front of razing machine gun fire; to wait open-eyed for a crossbeam to move sideways over their heads etc."). It was in those years that the first Fascist youth wings were formed: Avanguardia Giovanile Fascista (Fascist Youth Vanguards) in 1919, and Gruppi Universitari Fascisti (Fascist University Groups) in 1922.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} unusual parts of the cave is the Sand Garden, located about 3,000 feet (914m) from the entrance. [...] Here the floor of the cave is covered with sand. [...] The sand was carried into the cave by {{dripping}} water. [...] The sand is fine volcanic ash from the eruption of Mount Mazama 6,600 years ago. [...] Rain and melting snow carried the ash down from the surface through cracks in the rock and deposited it {{on the floor of the}} cave one grain at a time. [...] Occasionally, enough water leaks into the cave to create a pool. [...] This allows the sand to spread out across the floor. [...] At the Sand Garden, the constant dripping of water has carved spires and pinnacles in the sand. [...] Since it takes hundreds of years to build these delicate sand forms, the Forest Service has fenced off the garden area to protect it. [...] The 2,211 feet (674m) of cave trail beyond the Sand Garden has a sandy floor. [...] Along the way, the ceiling descends lower and lower until the sand fills the cave. [...] The last 310 feet (95m) of the cave was dug out of the sand plug by two men in the 1930s. [...] Exploring this section of the cave requires visitors to crawl <b>on</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees for much of the distance to the cave’s end, and usually takes at least thirty minutes.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{one hour}} long preparation, the 2/16th {{went in with}} two {{companies}} leading the assault: 'B' Company in the lead, with 'D' Company following it up. At the same time, the 2/27th Infantry Battalion carried out a feint attack along the Faria River. Overhead, Vasey viewed the battle in a Piper Cub light aircraft. 'B' Company attacked with a [...] "one up, two back" [...] formation for its platoons. Ladders fashioned out of bamboo were brought up to help the infantry scale the steep shale cliffs, but these proved too difficult to maneouvre and were discarded in favour of climbing <b>on</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees. The preparatory fires had the desired effect {{and for the most}} part the defenders were dazed, reducing the effectiveness of their resistance. However, on the left of the assault, the advance was held up by a pillbox that had to be attacked from the flank by a section from the right. Exploiting the position, the section began to establish themselves near the summit by around 09:46, while the rest of the platoon pushed [...] further towards another small outcrop, clearing Japanese from their entrenchments. Following the arrival of the Australian company commander with an artillery forward observer, another platoon pushed through the second outcrop in an effort to further exploit the position, but found itself held up around [...] "Green Sniper's Pimple", as it came up against a strongly held Japanese bunker.|$|E

2500|$|From 1935 the {{authorities}} began sending hundreds of Jehovah's Witnesses to concentration camps, {{where they were}} imprisoned with Communists, Socialists, other political prisoners and union members. In May 1938 they accounted for 12 percent of all prisoners at Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar; by May 1939 they represented 40 percent of all prisoners at Schloss Lichentenburg, the central concentration camp for women, though as {{the total number of}} prisoners increased rapidly, the proportion of Witnesses generally fell to about 3 percent. About 2,000 Witnesses were eventually sent to Nazi concentration camps, where they were identified by purple triangles; as many as 1,200 died in custody, including 250 who were executed. Garbe claims members of the group were special objects of hatred by the SS, receiving beatings, whippings and public humiliation and given the dirtiest and most laborious work details for refusing to salute, stand at attention or sing Nazi songs. They were subjected to high-pressure jets of ice-cold water from fire hydrants and subjected to arbitrary acts of torture including pushing a fully laden wheelbarrow with their necks while crawling <b>on</b> <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> knees. Others were forced to stand still for an entire day in the heat or cold or were confined in groups in small closets in an attempt to suffocate them. From March to December 1938 Jehovah's Witnesses in Buchenwald were not allowed to send or receive letters or to purchase food. Many approached starvation and were forced to eat leaves from trees and bushes. Many were forced to engage in a [...] "drill" [...] that included rolling, creeping, hopping and running for 75 minutes while camp guards kicked and beat them, while others, forced to work in stone quarries, were refused medical attention when sick. Despite persecution, Jehovah's Witnesses continued to hold secret religious gatherings inside the camps.|$|E
