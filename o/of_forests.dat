40|$|Nowadays, {{deforestation}} of {{territories and}} degradation <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources {{is a global}} problem as it leads to a climate change, soil degradation, the decline in natural reproduction <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources and to the disappearance of many valuable species <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> cultures. Due {{to the importance of}} the preservation <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources for environment it is necessary to revise the conceptual approach to the reflection of such resources both at the micro- and at the macroeconomic level. Preservation, rational use and reproduction <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources is one of the priorities of forestry development inUkraine. Accounting is a tool which allows to form the information about the condition and availability <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources. In this regard, we consider that the accounting information is an important tool for the preservation <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> assets and the reduction of anthropogenic impacts on these slowly recovering natural resources. The reflection <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources in accounting should be implemented {{on the basis of the}} rules defined in the P(S) BU 30 called «Biological Assets» and IAS 41 called «Agriculture». In addition, we consider that while reflecting <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources in accounting it’s necessary to take into account the life cycle of the tree stand which consists of several stages where each one should be taken into account in the recognition of expenses on their reproduction. For the formation of analytical cuts of the costs of care for the forest resources and their protection is proposed to open the following 3 sub-accounts to the account 155 called «Expenses on the formation <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources»: the first is «Expenses on the landing <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> cultures», the second is «Expenses on care for forest resources» and the third one is «Expenses on the protection <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources». Sustainable forest management involves the reproduction <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources. One <b>of</b> the main criteria for evaluating the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> management on the basis of sustainable development is the increasing of their productivity, the achievement and maintenance of high level of sanitary state <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources and provision of stable viability <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> ecosystems providing appropriate security and protection <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources. The proposed method <b>of</b> accounting <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources matches to the basic principles of the concept of sustainable development as it allows to generate the information about the reproduction of natural capital in the system of accounting and business entities reporting. The proposed changes in accounting will improve the enterprise management system <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> complex by forming the complete and reliable information about the availability and condition <b>of</b> <b>forest</b> resources and forest products. They will also provide the advantages to enterprises during participating in tenders when implementing of wood and the products of its recycling as they are confirmed by the legal origin of wood...|$|R
5|$|Forest covers about 12.6% of the country, {{most of it}} {{designated}} for commercial production. Forested areas typically consist of monoculture plantations of non-native species, which may result in habitats that are not suitable for supporting native species of invertebrates. Remnants of native forest can be found scattered around the island, in particular in the Killarney National Park. Natural areas require fencing to prevent over-grazing by deer and sheep that roam over uncultivated areas.
