5|$|Cooperative {{multitasking}} {{made its}} Macintosh debut in March 1985 {{with a program}} called Switcher by Andy Hertzfeld, which allowed the user to launch multiple applications and switch between them. Many programs and features did not function correctly with Switcher. Also, Switcher did not display windows of <b>other</b> <b>applications</b> beside the selected one. It was not included with the operating system, but was available from Apple for purchase separately. Both System 5 and System 6 had a feature called MultiFinder instead, which was much more mature and widely used in System 6. MultiFinder could be enabled or disabled, with a reboot. If disabled, the Finder would quit when the user launched another application, thus freeing RAM for it. If enabled, the system behaved as in the nowadays familiar multitasking tradition, with the desktop and windows of <b>other</b> <b>applications</b> in the screen's background.|$|E

5|$|Neodymium–iron–boron magnets {{can have}} up to 6% of the {{neodymium}} substituted by dysprosium to raise the coercivity for demanding applications, such as drive motors for electric vehicles and generators for wind turbines. This substitution would require up to 100grams of dysprosium per electric car produced. Based on Toyota's projected 2million units per year, the use of dysprosium in applications such as this would quickly exhaust its available supply. The dysprosium substitution may also be useful in <b>other</b> <b>applications</b> because it improves the corrosion resistance of the magnets.|$|E
