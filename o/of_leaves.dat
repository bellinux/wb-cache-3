The blackcurrant sawfly (Nematus ribesii) lays its eggs {{on the underside of}} the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded <b>of</b> <b>leaves.</b> Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and earwigs.|$|E

40|$|Masteroppgave i økonomi og administrasjon - Universitetet i Agder 2011 The job {{satisfaction}} level {{is a key}} determinant for the employees’ leaving or retention decisions. The satisfied employees {{have a tendency to}} stay in the organization while the dissatisfied employees have a greater tendency to leave the organization. The research study on impact of {{job satisfaction}} on perceived desirability <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> was conducted by selecting the executive level employees in cable manufacturing industry in Sri Lanka. The main objective {{of this study was to}} examine the impact of job satisfaction on perceived desirability <b>of</b> <b>leaving.</b> This was split into three sub objectives as; to examine the type of relationship between the job satisfaction and perceived desirability <b>of</b> <b>leaving,</b> to examine the type of relationship between the availability of outside job alternatives and perceived desirability <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> and to examine whether the availability of outside job alternatives weaken the negative relationship between the job satisfaction and perceived desirability <b>of</b> <b>leaving.</b> In order to realize these three objectives, three hypotheses were developed and tested by using regression analysis. It was evident in this study that the relationship between the job satisfaction and the perceived desirability <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> is negative and complies with the similar studies which have been conducted in different contexts. This proves that the dissatisfied employees have intentions to leave the cable manufacturing companies. This study also provided significant evidence to prove the positive relationship between availability of outside job alternatives and perceived desirability <b>of</b> <b>leaving.</b> However, there was no significance evidence to prove that the availability of outside job alternatives has a moderating effect for the relationship of job satisfaction and the perceived desirability <b>of</b> <b>leaving.</b> This represent as the major contribution of this study. Even the literature supports that there is a moderating effect to the main relationship between the job satisfaction and perceived desirability <b>of</b> <b>leaving,</b> there was no significant effect from availability of outside job alternatives which moderate the relationship between the job satisfaction and perceived desirability <b>of</b> <b>leaving.</b> In addition to the main variables, three control variables, which include the age, marital status and the tenure of the executives, have significant effect for the dependent variable-perceived desirability <b>of</b> <b>leaving.</b> Therefore, the findings about the influence of those control variables on perceived desirability <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> provide some insight to human resources policy changes.

5|$|Areoles are {{structures}} {{unique to}} cacti. Although variable, they typically appear as woolly or hairy {{areas on the}} stems from which spines emerge. Flowers are also produced from areoles. In the genus Pereskia, believed similar to the ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem). In leafless cacti, areoles are often borne on raised areas on the stem where leaf bases would have been.|$|E
5|$|Both species {{live on the}} ground, {{are active}} during the night, are solitary, and feed mainly on fruits and seeds, but may also eat herbs and insects. They build nests <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> and {{branches}} among vegetation, for example in a tree hollow, or under rocks. In Panama, T.talamancae breeds throughout the year and the average litter size is about six. Various species of mites, chiggers, fleas, and sucking lice have been recorded as parasites on both species.|$|E

5|$|Cacti show a {{wide variety}} of growth habits, which are {{difficult}} to divide into clear, simple categories. They can be tree-like (arborescent), meaning they typically have a single more-or-less woody trunk topped by several to many branches. In the genus Pereskia, the branches are covered with leaves, so the species of this genus may not be recognized as cacti. In most other cacti, the branches are more typically cactus-like, bare <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> and bark, and covered with spines, as in Pachycereus pringlei or the larger opuntias. Some cacti may become tree-sized but without branches, such as larger specimens of Echinocactus platyacanthus. Cacti may also be described as shrubby, with several stems coming from the ground or from branches very low down, such as in Stenocereus thurberi.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{is found}} in many butterflies. Some like the oakleaf {{butterfly}} and autumn leaf are remarkable imitations <b>of</b> <b>leaves.</b> As caterpillars, many defend themselves by freezing and appearing like sticks or branches. Others have deimatic behaviours, such as rearing up and waving their front ends which are marked with eyespots {{as if they were}} snakes. Some papilionid caterpillars such as the giant swallowtail (Papilio cresphontes) resemble bird droppings. Some caterpillars have hairs and bristly structures that provide protection while others are gregarious and form dense aggregations. Some species are myrmecophiles, forming mutualistic associations with ants and gaining their protection. Behavioural defences include perching and angling the wings to reduce shadow and avoid being conspicuous. Some female Nymphalid butterflies guard their eggs from parasitoidal wasps.|$|E
5|$|Cases of {{sick and}} dying trees of C.australis were first {{reported}} {{in the northern part}} of the North Island in 1987. The syndrome, eventually called Sudden Decline, soon reached epidemic proportions in Northland and Auckland. Affected trees usually suffer total defoliation within 2 to 12 months. The foliage turns yellow, and the oldest leaves wither and fall off. Growth <b>of</b> <b>leaves</b> ceases, and eventually all the leaves fall, leaving dead branches, often with the dried-out flowering panicles still attached. At the same time, the bark on the trunk becomes loose and detaches easily. The greatest number of dead trees (18 to 26 percent) was recorded around Auckland.|$|E
40|$|This article {{studies the}} {{association}} between social norms and the timing <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> home. Although largely overlooked by most recent studies on leaving home, life-course theory suggests that age norms and age grading infl uence life-course decisions in general and leaving home in particular. We use Fishbein and Ajzen’s model of “reasoned behavior” to integrate this strand of research with the more individualistic view that dominates current thinking. Using data from a Dutch panel survey, we use a Cox regression model with a control for sample selection to estimate {{the association between}} perceived age norms and the timing <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> home. We show that perceived opinions of parents {{are associated with the}} actual timing <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> the parental home but that societal norms and friends’ norms concerning the timing <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> home are not. In addition, the timing <b>of</b> <b>leaving</b> home is also associated with the perceived housing market situation. ...|$|R

5|$|During {{the first}} {{publications}} <b>of</b> <b>Leaves</b> of Grass, Whitman had financial difficulties {{and was forced}} to work as a journalist again, specifically with Brooklyn's Daily Times starting in May 1857. As an editor, he oversaw the paper's contents, contributed book reviews, and wrote editorials. He left the job in 1859, though it is unclear whether he was fired or chose to leave. Whitman, who typically kept detailed notebooks and journals, left very little information about himself in the late 1850s.|$|E

Leaves of Grass was revised and re-released in 1860 again in 1867, and several more times throughout the remainder of Whitman's life. Several well-known writers admired the work enough to visit Whitman, including Amos Bronson Alcott and Henry David Thoreau.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{tradition}} holds that, {{because of}} the great value of wood, only expert scribes used it, while pupils wrote on banana leaves.

He found experimentally that the glyphs were quite visible on banana leaves due to the sap that emerged from the cuts and dried on the surface. However, when the leaves themselves dried they became brittle and would not have survived for long.|$|E
