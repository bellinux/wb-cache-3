Remains from the Rancholabrean period (300,000 to 11,000 years ago) {{have been found}} in states such as Georgia and Tennessee, both of which are well south <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>current</b> range. After the receding of the ice, wood turtle colonies were able to re-inhabit their customary northern range (areas like New Brunswick and Nova Scotia).|$|E
5|$|Adventure was {{published}} by the developer of the 2600 console, Atari, Inc, and programmed by Atari employee Warren Robinett. At the time, Atari programmers were generally given full control on the creative direction and development cycle for their games, but this required them to plan for their next game as they neared completion <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>current</b> one to stay productive. Robinett was finishing his work on Slot Racers when he was {{given an opportunity to}} visit the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Julius Smith, one of several friends he was sharing a house with. There, he was introduced to the 1977 version of the computer text game Colossal Cave Adventure, created by Will Crowther and modified by Don Woods. After playing the game for several hours, he was inspired to create a graphical version of the game.|$|E
5|$|Robert E. Hall applied {{rational}} expectations to Friedman's permanent income hypothesis that people base the level <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>current</b> spending on their wealth and lifetime income rather than current income. Hall {{found that people}} will smooth their consumption over time and only alter their consumption patterns when their expectations about future income change. Both Hall's and Friedman's versions of the permanent income hypothesis challenged the Keynesian view that short-term stabilization policies like tax cuts can stimulate the economy. The permanent income view suggests that consumers base their spending on wealth, so a temporary boost in income would only produce a moderate increase in consumption. Empirical tests of Hall's hypothesis suggest it may understate boosts in consumption due to income increases; however, Hall's work helped to popularize Euler equation models of consumption.|$|E

5|$|The Great Powers occupying Paris {{demanded that}} Louis XVIII {{implement}} a constitution. Louis responded with the Charter of 1814, which included many progressive provisions: freedom of religion, a legislature {{composed of the}} Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Peers, a press that would enjoy a degree of freedom, and a provision that the Biens nationaux would remain in the hands <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>current</b> owners. The constitution had 76 articles. Taxation was to be voted on by the chambers. Catholicism {{was to be the}} official religion of France. To be eligible for membership in the Chamber of Deputies, one had to pay over 1,000 francs per year in tax, and be over the age of forty. The king would appoint peers to the Chamber of Peers on a hereditary basis, or for life at his discretion. Deputies would be elected every five years, with one fifth of them up for election each year. There were 90,000 citizens eligible to vote.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that one male sires all of the {{offspring}} there is less genetic diversity in the community, which is disadvantageous to females. Additionally, females sometimes encounter infanticide, which is when a breeding male is overthrown and a new breeding male becomes dominant and kills all <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>current</b> offspring, as he has not fathered them. Because the females no longer have offspring to nurse, they will go into estrous sooner, which allows the new breeding male to mate with the females earlier.|$|E

25|$|A bank is a {{financial}} institution that accepts deposits from the public and creates credit. Lending activities can be performed {{either directly or indirectly}} through capital markets. Due to their importance in the financial stability of a country, banks are highly regulated in most countries. Most nations have institutionalized a system known as fractional reserve banking under which banks hold liquid assets equal to only a portion <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>current</b> liabilities. In addition to other regulations intended to ensure liquidity, banks are generally subject to minimum capital requirements based on an international set of capital standards, known as the Basel Accords.|$|E

25|$|While the {{threshold}} age was {{changed in the}} 2017 CBA, {{the mechanics of the}} rule remained the same. Notably, several members of the union's executive committee at the time the 2017 CBA was negotiated were older players who were seen as potential major beneficiaries of a change to an over-38 rule. For example, the change to an over-38 rule gave union president Chris Paul, scheduled to become a free agent after the 2016–17 season, a potential gain of nearly $50 million over the life of his next contract. Similarly, executive committee members LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony, who could opt out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>current</b> contracts after the same season, had the potential for similar gains with this change.|$|E
