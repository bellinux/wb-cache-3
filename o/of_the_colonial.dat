5|$|Ann Eliza Bleecker's {{pastoral}} poems exemplified a {{new style}} of American poetry, and, due to her experience of the American Revolutionary tumult, {{a new sense of}} national identity. These poems, written in the pastoral tradition, conveyed both the beauty <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> New York countryside and the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified young mother, her articulate depictions of the Revolutionary War are still read by historians today.|$|E

Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito, the poverty of its people and their lack of good education, and he denounced the corruption <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> authorities.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, the Portuguese {{presence}} on the Angolan coast remained limited for much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> period.

5|$|Once {{the prison}} {{came under the}} control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonial</b> government, it was renamed Fremantle Prison.

This influx included desperate, dishonest people, from elsewhere in Australia and overseas, and Fremantle Prison was soon overcrowded.|$|E
