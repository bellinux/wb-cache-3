5|$|A newly industrialized country, the Philippine {{economy has}} been {{transitioning}} from <b>one</b> <b>based</b> upon agriculture to an economy with more emphasis upon services and manufacturing. Of the country's total labor force of around 40.813 Million, the agricultural sector employs 30% of the labor force, and accounts for 14% of GDP. The industrial sector employs around 14% of the workforce and accounts for 30% of GDP. Meanwhile, the 47% of workers involved in the services sector are responsible for 56% of GDP.|$|E
5|$|Anamorphic or {{imperfect}} fungi {{are those that}} seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce {{by the process of}} mitosis in structures called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, <b>one</b> <b>based</b> on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of S.coccinea is Molliardiomyces dudleyi.|$|E

5|$|Massachusetts {{manufactured}} 3.4 {{percent of}} total United States military armaments produced during World War II, ranking tenth among the 48 states. In Eastern Massachusetts, following World War II, the economy was transformed from <b>one</b> <b>based</b> on heavy industry into a service-based economy. Government contracts, private investment, and research facilities led to a new and improved industrial climate, with reduced unemployment and increased per capita income. Suburbanization flourished, and by the 1970s, the Route 128 corridor was dotted with high-technology companies who recruited graduates of the area's many elite institutions of higher education.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 1867, Ottoman Sultan Abdülaziz {{formally}} recognized Isma'il Pasha by {{the title}} Khedive, which ranked {{higher than that}} of Vizier but lower than that of Caliph. The Khedivate of Egypt was still nominally a subject of the Ottoman Sultan, and its rulers were still technically appointed and dismissed by an imperial firman. Nevertheless, the Khedive actually exercised most sovereign powers, including the appointment of his council of ministers, the rector of Al-Azhar, and high-ranking military and naval officers. He could also sign treaties with foreign powers and borrow money for the state treasury. On 17 May 1866, the rule of succession in Egypt was changed from <b>one</b> <b>based</b> on agnatic seniority to <b>one</b> <b>based</b> on male primogeniture in the direct line of Isma'il Pasha. After the British occupied the country in 1882, the Khedive's exercise of power was limited greatly by the advice of the British agent and consul general, who became the de facto ruler of the country.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} the first British {{airborne}} raid, Operation Colossus, prompted the War Office to expand the airborne force {{through the creation of}} the Parachute Regiment, and to develop plans to convert several infantry battalions into parachute and glider battalions. On 31 May 1941, a joint Army and RAF memorandum was approved by the Chiefs-of-Staff and Winston Churchill; it recommended that the British airborne forces should consist of two parachute brigades, <b>one</b> <b>based</b> in England and the other in the Middle East, and that a glider force of 10,000 men should be created.|$|E

The main tendency of each category with their principle ideas, application field, advantages and disadvantages are discussed. For each considered type some typical algorithms are described. Algorithms of the third category are mainly focused because of the intensive investigation on deformable models in the recent years. Possible applications of these algorithms on segmenting organs and tissues contained in the pelvic cavity are also discussed through several preliminary experiments...|$|R
