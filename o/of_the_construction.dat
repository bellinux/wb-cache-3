5|$|After its {{founding}} in 1915, a large source of the Avery Brundage Company's business was wartime government contracts.

5|$|Architects were HRTB and {{the main}} {{contractor}} was NCC Construction. While domed stadiums have been common in North America, no such stadiums of comparable size of Telenor Arena had previously been built for football in Europe. Construction started by demolishing a hangar, which was completed in February 2007.

5|$|Due to {{the limited}} budget, the {{restoration}} had been primarily focused on cleaning the sculptures, and Van Erp did not solve the drainage problem.

5|$|In 1927, Route 3 was legislated {{along the}} Paterson Plank Road portion of present-day Route 120. It was {{eventually}} designated {{along the entire}} portion of current Route 120. In 1953, Route 3 was moved to its current freeway alignment, replacing Route S3, and a portion of Route 20 was designated to run from current Route 3 north to Paterson Plank Road while Paterson Plank Road {{was removed from the}} state highway system. The portion of Paterson Plank Road that lost its state highway status in 1953 gained it back in 1972, when it became an extension of Route 20 as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of the Meadowlands Sports Complex. As this route was not connected to the mainline of Route 20, it was designated Route 120 by the 1990s. As a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> of American Dream Meadowlands, the interchange between Route 3 and Route 120 was improved. An overpass between eastbound Route 3 and northbound Route 120 was completed in 2009 and a flyover from southbound Route 120 to eastbound Route 3 was completed in 2010.|$|E
