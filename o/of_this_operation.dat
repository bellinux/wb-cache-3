5|$|For centuries, {{tracheotomy}} {{was considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, on patients who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had improved the outcome <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>operation</b> {{to the point that it}} could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E
5|$|In late May {{and early}} June 1951, the Eighth Army {{launched}} Operation Piledriver, a concentrated effort to push Chinese and North Korean troops further north {{and out of}} South Korea. The 25th Infantry Division advanced as part <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>operation.</b> The 24th Infantry saw a slow advance during this operation, attempting to advance on Kumwha but encountering strong resistance. On July 1, the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry took heavy casualties {{and was forced to}} withdraw to reserve positions, and the 1st and 3rd Battalions moved up to continue the advance.|$|E
5|$|Operation Tractable was {{the final}} {{offensive}} conducted by Canadian and Polish troops, supported by one brigade of British tanks, {{as part of the}} Battle of Normandy during World War II. The goal <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>operation</b> was to capture the strategically important French town of Falaise and then the smaller towns of Trun and Chambois. This operation was undertaken by the First Canadian Army, the 1st Polish Armoured Division and a British armoured brigade against Army Group B of the Wehrmacht as part of the largest encirclement on the Western Front during the Second World War. Despite a slow start and limited gains north of Falaise, novel tactics by the 1st Polish Armoured Division—under the command of Generał brygady Stanisław Maczek during the drive for Chambois—enabled the Falaise Gap to be partially closed by 19 August 1944, trapping about 150,000 German soldiers in the Falaise Pocket.|$|E

5|$|The {{campaign}} {{opened on}} 1 May 1945 when the 26th Brigade Group {{landed on the}} small island of Tarakan off {{the east coast of}} Borneo. The goal <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>operation</b> was to secure the island's airstrip as a base to support the planned landings at Brunei and Balikpapan. While it had been expected that it would take only a few weeks to secure Tarakan and re-open the airstrip, intensive fighting on the island lasted until 19 June and the airstrip was not opened until 28 June. As a result, the operation is generally considered to have not been worthwhile.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{repair and}} recovery plan was {{enacted by the}} Government of the Cook Islands within a month of Cyclone Pat, which covered agricultural, infrastructural, and societal sectors. Financial restraints hindered the expected progress <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>operation,</b> with {{more than two-thirds of}} it not being funded by the final plan report on March4. Of the NZ$15million (US$10.6million) in home damage, NZ$7.2million (US$5.1million) was covered. New Zealand later provided a NZ$5.5million (US$3.9million) grant to assist in this effort. Priority was placed on repairing damaged homes, with lesser emphasis on destroyed ones. Labor costs would ultimately reach NZ$6million (US$4.2million) for this project. Finalization of the funding for reconstruction was delayed and had not started by early June, with some residents still living in tents. Farmers were provided with NZ$195,000 (US$138,000) worth of seeds, seedlings, and various supplies to jump-start agricultural recovery. Since the majority of the island's electrical grid was destroyed, an earlier plan to convert the network to underground cables was accelerated due to a convenience factor.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, California was in {{the midst}} of a gold rush; backed by this sudden demand for luxuries, New England {{companies}} made the first shipments, by ship to San Francisco and Sacramento, in California, including a shipment of refrigerated apples. The market was proved, but shipping ice in this way was expensive and demand outstripped supply. Ice began to be ordered instead from the then Russian-controlled Alaska in 1851 at $75 a ton (901kg). The American-Russian Commercial Company was subsequently formed in San Francisco in 1853 to work in partnership with the Russian-American Company of Alaska to supply ice to the west coast of America. The Russian company trained Aleutian teams to harvest ice in Alaska, built saw-mills to produce insulating saw-dust and shipped the ice south along with supplies of chilled fish. The costs <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>operation</b> remained high and M. Tallman founded the rival Nevada Ice Company, which harvested ice on Pilot Creek and transported to Sacramento, bringing the west coast price for ice down to seven cents ($2) a pound (0.5kg).|$|E

5|$|In February 1967 1 ATF {{focused on}} the Dat Do area and the {{south-east}} of Phuoc Tuy province, initiating a program of conventional operations and pacification, with 5 RAR concentrating on cordon and search and civic action against Viet Cong cadres in the villages, while 6 RAR was tasked with search and destroy missions targeting the Viet Cong D445 Battalion. During the first week 6 RAR conducted ambushes along Route 23 between Dat Do and the Suoi Tre river, pre-empting Viet Cong attacks in the area during the Tet holiday. The results <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>operation</b> were modest, and the Australians suffered a number of casualties from a misplaced fire mission from the 161st Battery, Royal New Zealand Artillery which killed four and wounded 13, including Warrant Officer Class Two Jack Kirby, who had earlier received the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions at Long Tan, and was among the dead. Meanwhile, 5 RAR continued its cordon and search operations. On 13–14 February the battalion completed a cordon and search of An Nhut, just west of Dat Do, with South Vietnamese forces, apprehending 14 Viet Cong suspects, five communist sympathisers, two South Vietnamese Army (ARVN) deserters and a draft dodger. The Australians again suffered heavy casualties after the officer commanding C Company, his second-in-command, and a New Zealand artillery forward observer were killed by an unrecorded ARVN mine. Regardless, these operations met with some success, and over a six-day period the battalion captured 40 Viet Cong. Yet even as Graham continued to refine his strategy the Viet Cong struck, and this sudden initiative would force the Australians into the type of conventional engagement that Westmoreland had been advocating.|$|E
5|$|Modeste and Impérieuse were {{high-quality}} modern {{ships and}} were both immediately recommissioned into the Royal Navy, Modeste {{with the same}} name and Impérieuse as HMS Unite as there was already a ship with a similar name in service. The repercussions <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>operation</b> were severe however. Gell, acting on instructions from Hood, had violated Genoese neutrality in a deliberate attempt to intimidate the pro-Republican faction in the city, but their actions were readily seized upon by French propagandists such as Nicolas Ozanne, who portrayed the raid as a massacre of unarmed sailors in print form. The Genoese government broke off diplomatic relations with Britain, permitting only French ships to enter the harbour. The British instituted a blockade, {{and as a result}} the 5,000 Austrian reinforcements destined for Toulon were unable to embark. Drake and all British inhabitants of Genoa were expelled, and Gell initiated a blockade of the city, seizing neutral merchant shipping destined for the port. Three ships were stationed at Leghorn to watch the more quiescent Tuscan government, including the Royalist Scipion. On 26 November, Scipion, which was carrying 150 prisoners taken in the raid on Genoa, caught fire, possibly the result of arson, and was destroyed, although other accounts suggest that a barrel of brandy was ignited accidentally by a candle. The blaze killed 390 of the Royalist crew, many of whom were classed as unfit for duty.|$|E
5|$|On 6June, Wolfe {{received}} {{a message from}} Arnold informing him that the Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted a raid to be conducted against Japan as soon as possible. The goals <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>operation</b> were to relieve pressure on Chinese forces which were being attacked by the Japanese and to support the invasion of Saipan. Arnold's message also asked how many B-29s could be dispatched on 15 and 20June. At the time, the first raid on Japan was tentatively scheduled for 23June, when sufficient supplies {{were expected to be}} available in China to support 100 B-29 sorties. Wolfe replied stating that 50 B-29s could be used on 15June and 55 if the operation was conducted on the 20th of the month. Arnold regarded these numbers as too low, and directed that a raid by at least 70 B-29s be conducted against Japan on 15June. Following this order, XX Bomber Command's B-29s and transport aircraft embarked on an intensive effort to move fuel to China. Further fuel supplies were made available to the heavy bombers by reducing the activities of USAAF fighter units based in China. During the same period the command's ground crews reconditioned as many B-29s as possible to improve their reliability.|$|E

5|$|On 7 June 1942, German and Romanian forces began Operation Störfang, {{the final}} assault in the Siege of Sevastopol, which {{resulted}} in the city's capture on 4 July 1942. On the first day <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>operation,</b> Gollob claimed his 102nd victory, a LaGG-3 shot down over Sevastopol. The attack on Sevastopol was still making slow progress on 9 June, largely due to the artillery deployed within the fortress. Over the battle zone, Gollob claimed a I-153 shot down that day. Gollob did not claim any further victories until 18 June. The fighting over Sevastopol was still ongoing and Gollob claimed an Il-2 and a LaGG-3 over the southern sector of Sevastopol. These two victories took his total to 105. On 21 June 1942, Gollob was credited with two victories over LaGG-3 fighter aircraft. For this achievement, on 23 June, he was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords, after his score had increased to 107 aerial victories. This was the 13th presentation of this award. On 1 July 1942, he was promoted to Major.|$|E
5|$|The fleet carrier HMS Implacable was {{dispatched}} {{from the}} United Kingdom in February 1945 {{to reinforce the}} BPF. The ship arrived at Sydney on 8 May. On 24 May Implacable departed Sydney, and reached the BPF's forward base at Manus Island five days later. The {{main body of the}} BPF arrived at Manus to refuel on 30 May, and most of its ships continued to Sydney on 1 June. Implacable remained at Manus, which she and her air group used as a base for intensive training. As part of the preparations for the BPF's return to combat, Vice-Admiral Bernard Rawlings – the commander of the fleet's combat force – decided at around this time to dispatch Implacable and several other recently arrived warships to attack the Japanese positions at Truk. The purpose <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>operation</b> was to ensure that the warships' crews had recent combat experience before the BPF commenced operations off Japan during July. Rawlings' initial orders for the attack specified that it was to involve two days of air strikes against Japanese airfields. The crews of the ships involved, including Implacables aircraft pilots, were not told that the operation was being undertaken for training purposes.|$|E
