40|$|<b>Outward</b> <b>processing</b> {{has become}} a much {{discussed}} issue in Austria's economic policy debates. At first the negative impact on Austria's textile and apparel industry of the EU's <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> with East-Central Europe dominated the discussion. This problem disappeared, however, when Austria entered the EU. The increasing use of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> by Austria's firms to improve their price competitiveness has attracted less attention. This advantage was limited, however, by rules of origin, which rendered the export of merchandise produced in this way difficult. Again, membership in the EU removed these obstacles.

40|$|The US and the EU use <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> {{arrangements}} to shift labor intensive apparel operations to neighboring countries who have significantly lower labor costs, to promote demand for their capital-intensive textiles, {{and to provide}} economic assistance to the developing countries. They stimulate foreign investment, which, in turn, determines trade flows. The investment response to preferences is gradual because there are costs associated with capital stock adjustment. ^ This study focuses mostly on US <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade in apparel and textiles with the Caribbean. Preferential treatment of US <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade has been expanded recently by the Trade and Development Act of 2000 (TDA 2000). Tariffs were previously exempted only {{on the value of}} imported intermediates, and became zero afterwards. ^ To study <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade and the effects of trade policies in the long and short runs, a dynamic model with adjustment costs of investment is specified. The hypothesis of capital stock being the key determinant of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade flows in the short run and tariff changes having limited short-run effect on <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade is tested, using US data. Statistical tests support that hypothesis. The model is then used to simulate long-run outcomes of the introduction of TDA 2000 and the elimination of Multi-Fiber Agreement on US <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade in the Caribbean Basin since the latter has the potential to have significant impact on the US demand for <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> apparel. The costs and benefits of these trade policy changes are evaluated. ^ Simulations of the effects of TDA 2000 for Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Costa Rica showed that most of the adjustment of capital and trade would occur over 5 years, increasing trade by 12 % to 24 %. The elimination of MFA quotas, depending on the magnitude of its impact on US <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> (OP) demand, has the potential to eliminate the gains resulting from the adoption of TDA 2000. A 10 % negative MFA demand shock in 2000 decreased OP trade by 6 % and investment expenditures by 53 % on average as compared to the benchmark projections. A 30 % negative demand shock would bring disinvestments in all countries. ...|$|R

The focus is on cross-border sourcing of low-skill-intensive components of exports and import-competing products.

We find that <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> is more prevalent in import-competing industries, which are also the EU’s relatively intensive users of low-skilled labor. <b>Outward</b> <b>processing</b> in export industries is found to reduce the skill-to-low-skill ratio in EU industries, while <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> in import-competing industries has more ambiguous effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{dramatic}} increase in the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers observed in many developed countries has received much attention from economists in recent years. A similar rise of wage gap has now been observed for some newly developed economies, such as Hong Kong. However, few empirical studies have been carried out to explain the growing wage gap in these newly developed economies. This study uses the time series data to investigate the impact of increased <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade with the Chinese Mainland on the wage inequality of Hong Kong. We found that there is a significant positive association between the volume of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade and the wage premium of university graduates over primary school graduates and university graduates over secondary school graduates. Moreover, our econometric analysis also shows that it is the increased <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade that causes the widening of skill wage gap not vice versa. Furthermore, the increase of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade both increases the pay for well-educated people {{and at the same time}} decreases the pay for less well-educated people, thereby widening the wage gap in Hong Kong...|$|R

The immobilization-induced hyperalgesia (IIH) can disturb rehabilitation and {{activities of daily living}} in patients with orthopedic disorders. However, it is unclear what therapeutic and preventive approaches can be used to alleviate IIH. Exercise that activates the descending pain modulatory system may be effective for IIH. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the effects of treadmill exercise during the immobilization period, using the non-immobilized limbs, on IIH. Thirty-six 8 -week-old Wistar rats were randomly divided into (1) control, (2) immobilization (Im), and (3) immobilization and treadmill exercise (<b>Im.</b> +. <b>Ex)</b> groups. In the Im and <b>Im.</b> +. <b>Ex</b> groups, the right ankle joints of each rat were immobilized in full plantar flexion with a plaster cast for an 8 -week period. In the <b>Im.</b> +. <b>Ex</b> group, treadmill exercise (15. m/min, 30. min/day, 5 days/week) was administered during the immobilization period while the right hindlimb was kept immobilized. Mechanical hyperalgesia was measured using von Frey filaments every week. To investigate possible activation of the descending pain modulatory system, beta-endorphin expression levels in hypothalamus and midbrain periaqueductal gray were analyzed. Although IIH clearly occurred in the Im group, the hyperalgesia was partially but significantly reduced in the <b>Im.</b> +. <b>Ex</b> group. Beta-endorphin, which is one of the endogenous opioids, was selectively increased in the hypothalamus and midbrain periaqueductal gray of the <b>Im.</b> +. <b>Ex</b> group. Our data suggest that treadmill running using the non-immobilized limbs reduces the amount of hyperalgesia induced in the immobilized limb even if it is not freed. This ameliorating effect might be due to the descending pain modulatory system being activated by upregulation of beta-endorphin in the brain...|$|R

40|$|The {{countries}} of Central and Eastern Europe have displayed widely disparate trade performance {{since the beginning}} of the transition. The Czech Republic and Hungary have had some success moving into the production and export of more technologically-sophisticated, higher value-added goods, while Bulgaria and Slovakia have continued to specialize, sometimes increasingly, in low-skill, low-value-added goods. Poland and Romania are intermediate cases. In Poland, different parts of the economy show each of these tendencies. In Romania, performance is very different in different periods – significantly better after 1994 than before. In accounting for these patterns, our analysis points to the importance of direct foreign investment (DFI) and <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade. DFI has been an engine of technological and organization learning, but it has been significant only in the Czech Republic, Hungary and, most recently, Poland. Outward-processing trade (OPT) is widely spread and helps to explain the strong export performance of the region. The technological and organizational implications of OPT are, however, less obviously favourable: in particular, it does not encourage the development of differentiated, price-insensitive export products that offer countries insulation from foreign competition.

40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s the European apparel sector has {{witnessed}} a dramatic transformation. Driven by increasing costs in Western Europe, major Western apparel retailers and buyers have expanded their contracting of production into lower cost regions of `postcommunist' Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. One consequence {{of these changes}} is a burgeoning of apparel producers in peripheral European and North African regions, locked into supply relations with Western buyers. Equally apparent is a dramatic growth in apparel trade between the European Union (EU) and the countries of East - Central Europe (ECE). For much of the 1990 s these processes were driven by <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade arrangements between EU countries and applicant states in ECE, along with the EU customs union with Turkey.

40|$|At present, the {{business}} social responsibility {{is considered by}} a costs-benefits perspective, {{one of its most}} important benefits being that it can constitute a competitive advantage source for large enterprises {{as well as for the}} small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

A special case is represented by the SMEs operating on the basis of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade type of subcontracting, a business form characteristic for a large number of foreign investments operating on the Romanian market in the clothing industry, their competitive advantage being represented by the low cost production; it implies, also, a low cost of the workforce. In these conditions, one raises the question of the existence of ISR and of its forms of manifestations, the main hypothesis being that if the ISR exists, it is limited by the pursued advantage of the lowest costs possible and it is not formally practiced. This hypothesis was partially confirmed by the results of our case study, the most important finding being that of the necessity for the enterprise to practice some forms of ISR, as a result of contextual factors (cultural and socio-economical) influence, in order to efficiently function, it couldn't be possible only through the pursuit of low costs competitive advantage. internal social responsibility; competitive advantage; SMEs; lohn (<b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade); clothing industry; case study. ...|$|R

We find that unit values of exports from these countries to the EU rose steadily between 1988 and 1996, relative to the unit values of world exports to Europe. If increases in unit values satisfactorily proxy increases in product quality, then trade integration has fostered product upgrading and technological learning in the sample countries. We find that imported technologies and other sources of knowledge have a strong bearing on this pattern.

Explanations of Italy’s unusual industrial profile mainly emphasise the role of endogenous economic and cultural resources.

Note that, overall, the coefficients of worker and job characteristics do not change in a qualitative manner in these different specifications, nor do the GAV and ICT coefficients (except for the low skill level as a consequence of its interaction with the trade variables). We find some evidence (on the 5 % significance level) for a significant effect of import levels on the probability of becoming unemployed for low-skilled employees: A 1 % higher import value is associated with a 0.017 % (0.016 % for lagged imports) higher probability of becoming unemployed. In other words, low-skilled individuals who work in industries characterized by relatively large contemporaneous imports may, ceteris paribus, face a slightly greater likelihood of becoming unemployed.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the effects of globalisation of production in some footwear Italian districts. The aim is to investigate and compare the position of those districts in the process of fragmentation of production that affected the Italian footwear sector in the last few years. The following questions are tackled: Are Italian footwear districts specialising in some particular phases of the production cycle? Is there any common trend towards a reduction of activities carried out within the districts? Or, instead, are different patterns emerging according to districts’ main segment of market and according to the value chains (top brand, low brand, mass market) they belong to? This study explores these issues by analysing the pattern of fragmentation of production in the footwear sector at provincia level, with data on <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade (OPT) collected by Associazione Nazionale Calzaturieri Italiani (ANCI). Furthermore, it focuses on two case studies, Brenta and Barletta, in order to compare two districts characterised by a specialisation in different segments of the market. In the footwear districts investigated, we find evidence of differences in international delocalisation strategies and argue that these different patterns of specialisation are closely related with clusters’ market position. We suggest that the diverse patterns of specialisation condition the potential for industrial upgrading. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{some aspects of}} trade and {{investment}} relations between the EU and the countries {{of central and eastern}} Europe (CEEC). The approach used is based on a model of trade with, and development of, a frontier by a metropolitan economy developed by Ronald Findlay. Findlay’s model posits the existence of a monopolised supply of an input to the metropolitan economy. Development of the frontier enables the metropolitan economy to break the monopoly. The expansion of <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> trade between the EU and the CEEC, a form of intra-industry trade, is a notable feature of economic relations in Europe since the fall of the Soviet empire. This is modelled in the paper as a device whereby a supply side constraint (labour market restrictions) within the EU is relaxed by vertical disintegration of production and relocation outside the EU. This in turn has implications for the incorporation of the CEEC in the EU. While they remain outside the EU they provide regime competition, particularly in the area of labour market policy. The income distribution implications of this competition provides a political basis for moves to extend membership of the EU {{on the basis of the}} CEEC’s adopting the acquis communautaire.

The central idea is that heterogeneity of traded goods plays a crucial role both in terms of quality differentiation and vertical fragmentation of production. The basic concepts are presented in the introductory chapter. The second chapter presents an econometric study which shows that the role of factor intensity in IIT requires that different forms of IIT are properly distinguished. In the third chapter the evaluation of the impact of trade on labour markets is studied in a model in which IIT is explained on Heckscher-Ohlin principles. Applying the model to trade between Italy and less advanced countries and inferring the factor content of intra-industry trade from the inter-sectoral relationship between factor intensity and average unit values of exports, I find that the labour market effects f intra-industry trade add significantly to the estimated factor market impact of trade.

As expected, South European countries compete in the same range of products and in a more similar quality market with the CEECs than do other EC countries. A significant part of this trade is explained by outward-processing trade (OPT) of clothing, however. EC firms increasingly move the labour-intensive stages of production to the CEECs. OPT competes in a different quality market than `direct' trade. Up to 1993, trade policy favoured <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> and was against `direct' trade and foreign direct investment. We draw some lessons from a similar experience in Portugal regarding OPT movements, foreign direct investment and effects of trade policy changes. During the CEECs' transition period, the policy bias will be eliminated. EC firms may go on processing products in the CEECs or may move elsewhere. The competitive pressures on South European countries will not change with further trade liberalization towards the CEECs because those pressures are unlikely to depend on OPT location. New OPT legislation designed to keep employment in the EC may have distributive effects among EC countries, however. The CEECs are the most likely to suffer from the proposed legislation if it is strictly applied. Textiles and Clothing; Trade Integration; Trade Policy...|$|R
40|$|The Pearl River Delta {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} cases of economic re-integration after a long period of separation. Hong Kong's traditional policy of non-interventionism and China's open-door policy have induced a rapid increase in cross-border trade, <b>outward</b> <b>processing</b> and <b>outward</b> investment. The paper focuses on the different modes of integration as well as on the driving forces behind. It argues that small- and medium- sized enterprises have played the pivotal role in the Delta's economic development.
