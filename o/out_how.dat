5|$|Kennedy's chemists {{were able}} to reduce uranium hydride to {{uranium-235}} metal with 99.96% efficiency, and the metallurgists worked <b>out</b> <b>how</b> to cast and press it into the required shapes. While the chemists worked <b>out</b> <b>how</b> to purify plutonium, the metallurgists had to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> to cast it into a solid sphere. Eric Jette's CM-8 (Uranium and Plutonium Metallurgy) group found that they could stabilise plutonium in its malleable δ phase by alloying it with gallium. For his services, {{he was awarded the}} Medal for Merit by the President Harry S. Truman in 1946.|$|E

5|$|During Linnaeus' time it {{was normal}} for upper class women to have wet nurses for their babies. Linnaeus joined an ongoing {{campaign}} to end this practice in Sweden and promote breast-feeding by mothers. In 1752 Linnaeus published a thesis along with Frederick Lindberg, a physician student, based on their experiences. In {{the tradition of the}} period, this dissertation was essentially an idea of the presiding reviewer (prases) expounded upon by the student. Linnaeus' dissertation was translated into French by J.E. Gilibert in 1770 as La Nourrice marâtre, ou Dissertation sur les suites funestes du nourrisage mercénaire. Linnaeus suggested that children might absorb the personality of their wet nurse through the milk. He admired the child care practices of the Lapps and pointed <b>out</b> <b>how</b> healthy their babies were compared to those of Europeans who employed wet nurses. He compared the behaviour of wild animals and pointed <b>out</b> <b>how</b> none of them denied their newborns their breastmilk. It is thought that his activism played a role in his choice of the term Mammalia for the class of organisms.|$|E

5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, prokaryotes were {{regarded}} as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemistry, morphology and metabolism. For example, microbiologists tried to classify microorganisms based on the structures of their cell walls, their shapes, and the substances they consume. In 1965, Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling proposed instead using the sequences of the genes in different prokaryotes to work <b>out</b> <b>how</b> they are related to each other. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the main method used today.|$|E
5|$|Mark Mangini {{served as}} The Final Frontiers sound designer; he had {{previously}} worked on The Voyage Home. Because Mangini was concerned about creating continuity within Star Treks sounds, he decided to reuse some effects rather than create new and different-sounding ones— as such, the Bird of Prey's cloak effect, beaming sounds, and the Enterprise engines sound similar to past movies. Mangini collaborated with Shatner to work <b>out</b> <b>how</b> the completely new effects would sound. For Sybok's mind melds, Shatner wanted the sounds of beating hearts and breathing.|$|E

5|$|Paleontology {{seeks to}} map <b>out</b> <b>how</b> living {{things have changed}} through time. A {{substantial}} hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working <b>out</b> <b>how</b> old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires very careful laboratory work, its basic principle is simple: the rates at which various radioactive elements decay are known, and so {{the ratio of the}} radioactive element to the element into which it decays shows how long ago the radioactive element was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.|$|E
5|$|Adding to Sulley's lifelike {{appearance}} was an intense {{effort by the}} technical team to refine the rendering of fur. Other production houses had tackled realistic fur, most notably Rhythm & Hues in its 1993 polar bear commercials for Coca-Cola and in its talking animals' faces in the 1995 film Babe. This film, however, required fur on a far larger scale. From the standpoint of Pixar's engineers, the quest for fur posed several significant challenges; one was to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> to animate a large numbers of hairs — 2,320,413 of them on Sulley — in a reasonably efficient way, and another {{was to make sure}} that the hairs would cast shadows on other ones. Without self-shadowing, either fur or hair takes on an unrealistic flat-colored look (e.g., in Toy Story, the hair on Andy's toddler sister, as seen in that movie's opening sequence, is hair without self-shadowing).|$|E
5|$|Although {{only a small}} affray, it {{resulted}} {{in the deaths of}} some important people; viz. the Duke of Somerset, the Earl of Northumberland, and Lord Clifford. It has been suggested that, whilst Somerset might have been targeted by York, the latter too might have been intentionally slain by the Neville brothers. It was John who, after the battle, appears to have been responsible for the victorious Duke of York removing Sir William Skipwith from the household offices the latter held of the Duke. Neville was said to have achieved this by pointing <b>out</b> <b>how</b> Skipwith failed to join York in battle; John Neville subsequently shared in the profits of York's redistribution of Skipwith's ex-offices.|$|E

5|$|At Sandia Base, three Army officers, Captains Albert Bethel, Richard Meyer, and Bobbie Griffin {{attempted}} {{to re-create the}} Little Boy. They were supervised by Harlow W. Russ, an expert on Little Boy who served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was now leader of the Z-11 Group of the Los Alamos Laboratory's Z Division at Sandia. Gradually, they managed to locate the correct drawings and parts, and figured <b>out</b> <b>how</b> they went together. Eventually, they built six Little Boy assemblies. Although the casings, barrels, and components were tested, no enriched uranium was supplied for the bombs. By early 1947, the problem caused by the Wigner effect {{was on its way}} to solution, and the three officers were reassigned.|$|E

Coulson returns to being a field agent, due to the world believing he is dead, and is tasked with tracking down more enhanced people including Robbie Reyes / Ghost Rider. In addition, Agent Leo Fitz and Holden Radcliffe complete their work on the Life Model Decoy project as well as the development of the Framework.

5|$|Executives from Endemol, the {{production}} company for Big Brother worldwide, defended the format which is transmitted in 41 territories and noted the season {{premiere of the}} 11th season in America won its timeslot with year-to-year growth.

Paul Jonson, global head of marketing and brand partnerships for Endemol Group, noted that using audience averages to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> the show performs wouldn't work since the audience builds up until the finale. Jonson also noted that the series continued to rate very well when compared to the timeslot average for Channel 4.|$|E

Encouraged, Bart entertains a group of children and sets out on his path to become the school prankster.|$|E
5|$|In {{classical}} times, {{rather than}} making distant figures smaller with linear perspective, painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used reverse perspective for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his Book of Optics in 1021, but never applied it to art. The Renaissance saw a rebirth of Classical Greek and Roman culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand nature and the arts. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed to figure <b>out</b> <b>how</b> to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence {{of the physical world}} and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.|$|E
