The rationale: {{it has been reported}} that every year 15 million tonnes of food are wasted in the UK alone, and supermarkets and retailers are being blamed for this because they are convincing customers to purchase buy <b>one,</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> free products. They lure customers in by offering them something they don't necessarily need, and as a result of this food is wasted. Because many buy <b>one,</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> free foods have short shelf lives, customers do not get around to consuming the products before their ‘consume by date’.|$|R

The results show a trend: buy <b>one,</b> <b>get</b> <b>one</b> free promotions are aimed towards unhealthy products, such as chocolate, sweets, soft drinks, etc. Supermarkets might have to start using some of their marketing budget to specifically promote healthy products, and so would spend less money promoting unhealthy and fattening products.

25|$|Completing {{a number}} field K {{at a place}} w gives a {{complete}} field. If the valuation is archimedean, <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> R or C, if it is non-archimedean and lies over a prime p of the rationals, <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> a finite extension Kw / Qp: a complete, discrete valued field with finite residue field. This process simplifies the arithmetic {{of the field and}} allows the local study of problems. For example, the Kronecker–Weber theorem can be deduced easily from the analogous local statement. The philosophy behind the study of local fields is largely motivated by geometric methods. In algebraic geometry, it is common to study varieties locally at a point by localizing to a maximal ideal. Global information can then be recovered by gluing together local data. This spirit is adopted in algebraic number theory. Given a prime in the ring of algebraic integers in a number field, it is desirable to study the field locally at that prime. Therefore, one localizes the ring of algebraic integers to that prime and then completes the fraction field much in the spirit of geometry.|$|E

25|$|In How to Rock Climb, John Long {{notes that}} for {{moderately}} skilled climbers simply {{getting to the}} top of a route is not enough; how <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> to the top matters. In rock climbing, style refers to the method of ascending the cliff. There are three main styles of climbing: on-sight, flash, and redpoint. To on-sight a route is to ascend the wall without aid or any foreknowledge. It is considered the way to climb with the most style. Flashing is similar to on-sighting, except that the climber has previous information about the route including talking about the beta with other climbers. Redpointing means to make a free ascent of the route after having first tried it.|$|E

If all the numbers are used and no <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> three numbers that add up to 15 then the game is a draw.

25|$|For graphs {{drawn in}} the plane without crossings, Fáry's theorem states that <b>one</b> <b>gets</b> the same class of planar graphs {{regardless}} of whether the edges of the graph are drawn as straight line segments or as arbitrary curves. But this equivalence does not hold true for other types of drawing. For instance, although the crossing number of a graph (the minimum number of crossings in a drawing with arbitrarily curved edges) may be determined in NP, it is complete for the existential theory of the reals to determine whether there exists a drawing achieving a given bound on the rectilinear crossing number (the minimum number of pairs of edges that cross in any drawing with edges drawn as straight line segments {{in the plane}}).|$|E
