Six months after his resignation from parliament in July 1996, after various circulating rumours, O'Grady announced on television that he had AIDS. He made his announcement on the current affairs programme [...] "Witness", hosted by Jana Wendt, stating: [...] "I’m 35. I resigned from parliament in January. My parliamentary career is behind me. I have AIDS. It is progressing. I will fight on. Mind over matter." [...] His admission was met with overwhelming support including the Labor Premier Bob Carr, who said: [...] "Having a politician say, 'This is my life, HIV and Aids', is a reminder to everyone that a lot more <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen in our society." ...|$|E

I love this because this is the beginning, and all <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have an end". Having only intended to sculpt the rock, Kornegay was told by God to [...] "Go further" [...] and he asked God to [...] "Tell me how when I get up in the morning". The next day he was compelled to [...] "Put a piece here, put a piece there, put a piece over yonder. Go back and get that; never throw nothing away...So I fixed it up his way. I spaced it, you know, with the eye God give me. Everything got a place. I told them, [...] "I can see more with my eyes closed than they can see with their eyes open."

In his review for the Globe and Mail, Rick Groen praised Emily Lloyd's performance: [...] "Emily Lloyd, the callow Brit who burned up the screen in Wish You Were Here, is letter perfect [...] - [...] her accent impeccable and her energy immense". USA Today gave the film {{three out of four}} stars and praised Bruce Willis' [...] "subsidiary performance as Lloyd's reclusive guardian-uncle is admirably short on showboating". In his review for The Guardian, Derek Malcolm praised Lloyd for her [...] "portrait is of a lively waif who does not intend to be easily defeated by the comedy of life without adding a few jokes of her own, and it is the most complete thing she has so far done on the screen, good as she was in Wish You Were Here". Time magazine felt that the script [...] "perhaps pursues too many banal and inconsequential matters as it portrays teen life in a small town", but that [...] "the film starts to gather force and direction when a dance, organized to honor the local Viet vets, works out awkwardly". Furthermore, its critic felt that the film was [...] "a lovely, necessary little stitch in our torn time".|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} become {{globally}} competitive, South Africa has embarked on an industrial development zone (IDZ) programme to boost investment, increase the socio-economic climate, attract world-class manufacturers and generate local and foreign direct investment (FDI) while creating employment, encouraging skills and technology transfer, and increasing foreign exchange earnings. Twelve strategic areas within South Africa have been identified and {{are in the process}} of, or have been, declared IDZs. East London and Coega are the first two IDZs to come online in South Africa and have generated much publicity in the past number of years. One of the aims of the IDZs, as world-class production areas, is to generate FDI. Drivers of international FDI include globalisation, political, economic and legal environments and competitive advantage. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (2002 : 25), FDI accounts for 16 percent of worldwide gross fixed capital formation – and a growing proportion <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> developing nations. According to the World Economic Processing Zones Association (WEPZA), IDZs have been the star performer in attracting investment and technology to developing countries during the past 50 years (2002 : www. wepza. org). If the Eastern Cape IDZ programme is to be a success, the development corporations that have been established as the management arms of the IDZs will need to facilitate strategic economic advantage, look towards strategic investments that are sustainable, take advantage of and grow existing industrial capacity and create economic and social benefits for the region. There are a number of dynamics and reasons behind global FDI decisions. In order to be successful at attracting FDI the development corporations need to understand these dynamics and reasons in order to achieve a strategic fit between potential investor and the IDZ. This can be done by adopting a strategic management model for greenfield FDI from international investors...|$|E
50|$|Appraisal {{theory is}} the theory in {{psychology}} that emotions are extracted from our evaluations (appraisals or estimates) {{of events that}} cause specific reactions in different people. Essentially, our appraisal of a situation causes an emotional, or affective, response that <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> based on that appraisal. An example <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on a first date. If the date is perceived as positive, one might feel happiness, joy, giddiness, excitement, and/or anticipation, because they have appraised this event as one that could have positive long-term effects, i.e. starting a new relationship, engagement, or even marriage. On the other hand, if the date is perceived negatively, then our emotions, as a result, might include dejection, sadness, emptiness, or fear. (Scherer et al., 2001) Reasoning and understanding of one's emotional reaction becomes important for future appraisals as well. The {{important aspect of the}} appraisal theory is that it accounts for individual variances of emotional reactions to the same event.|$|R
