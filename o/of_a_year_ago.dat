60|$|As it was, the {{examining}} chaplain {{did not recognize}} the lean, pale, anxious man, for the round-faced, rosy, overgrown boy <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> His scholarship and critical knowledge were fairly above the mark, {{in spite of a}} racking headache; and his written sermon, together with all that was elicited from him, revealed, all unconsciously to himself, what treasures he had brought back from the deep waters which had so nearly closed over him.|$|E
60|$|Men seldom {{understand}} the subterfuges women instinctively use to conceal many a natural emotion {{which they are}} {{not strong enough to}} control, not brave enough to confess.

60|$|Suddenly {{she began}} to feel frightened. Some evil spirit, {{possibly}} the kettle, seemed to whisper to her that she had been foolish in coming here, to cast doubts on what she had hitherto regarded as the one rock-solid fact in the world, her love for Geoffrey. Could she have changed since those days in Wales? Life had been so confusing of late. In the vividness of recent happenings those days in Wales seemed a long way off, and she herself different from the girl <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> She found herself thinking about George Bevan.|$|E
6000|$|As we {{were going}} she came out with us, and went running on in front. We could not help noting how ragged and unkempt was her short black skirt.

I could not think this was the Strelley Mill <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> She fluttered up the steep orchard bank in front of us.

60|$|How every {{circumstance}} of her short, eventful life, came {{thronging into}} her mind, as they travelled on! Slight incidents, {{never thought of}} or remembered until now; faces, seen once and ever since forgotten; words scarcely heeded at the time; scenes, <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> and those of yesterday, mixing up and linking themselves together; familiar places shaping themselves out in the darkness from things which, when approached, were, of all others, the most remote and most unlike them; sometimes, a strange confusion in her mind relative to the occasion of her being there, and the place to which she was going, and the people she was with; and imagination suggesting remarks and questions which sounded so plainly in her ears, that she would start, and turn, and be almost tempted to reply;--all the fancies and contradictions common in watching and excitement and restless change of place, beset the child.|$|E
60|$|The father {{reflected}} a moment what answer he should give. It {{did not seem}} to him that George spoke of such a marriage as though the rumour of it had made him unhappy. The question had been asked almost with indifference. And then the young man's manner to Marie, and Marie's manner to him, during the last two days had made him certain that he had been right in supposing that they had both forgotten the little tenderness <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> And Michel had thoroughly made up his mind that it would be well that Marie should marry Adrian. He believed that he had already vanquished Marie's scruples. She had promised 'to try and think better of it,' before George's return; and therefore was he not justified in regarding the matter as almost settled? 'I think that they will be married,' said he to his son.|$|E
60|$|Education of {{the people}} {{entitled}} to exercise the right of franchise I regard essential to general prosperity everywhere, and especially so in republics, where birth, education, or previous condition does not enter into account in giving suffrage. Next to the public school, the post-office is the great agent of education over our vast territory. The rapidity with which new sections are being settled, thus increasing the carrying of mails in a more rapid ratio than the increase of receipts, is not alarming. The report of the Postmaster-General herewith attached shows {{that there was an}} increase of revenue in his Department in 1873 over the previous year of $1,674,411, and an increase of cost of carrying the mails and paying employees of $3,041,468.91. The report of the Postmaster-General gives interesting statistics of his Department, and compares them with the corresponding statistics <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago,</b> showing a growth in every branch of the Department.|$|E

6000|$|He {{touched his}} neck proudly. It was encircled by the stiffest of stick-up collars, which custom decreed could be worn {{only by the}} Sixth. And the Sixth saw those collars and said no word. [...] "Pussy," [...] Abanazar, or Dick Four <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> would have seen them {{discarded}} in five minutes or... But the Sixth of that term was made up mostly of young but brilliantly clever boys, pets of the house-masters, too anxious for their dignity to care to come to open odds with the resourceful three. So they crammed their caps at the extreme back of their heads, instead of a trifle over one eye as the Fifth should, and rejoiced in patent-leather boots on week-days, and marvellous made-up ties on Sundays--no man rebuking. McTurk was going up for Cooper's Hill, and Stalky for Sandhurst, in the spring; and the Head had told them both that, unless they absolutely collapsed during the holidays, they were safe. As a trainer of colts, the Head seldom erred in an estimate of form.|$|E

Mary can't help me--not for all the honor she does me, nor all the big books on art that she pores over. Mallet can't help me--not with all his money, nor all his good example, nor all his friendship, which I 'm so profoundly well aware of: not with it all multiplied a thousand times and repeated to all eternity! I thought you would help me, you and Mary; that 's why I sent for you. But you can't, don't think it! The sooner you give up the idea the better for you. Give up being proud of me, too; there 's nothing left of me to be proud <b>of!</b> <b>A</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago</b> I was a mighty fine fellow; but do you know what has become of me now?

60|$|It was on such {{occasions}} as these, that Nicholas, yielding almost unconsciously to {{the interest}} of old associations, would point out some tree that he had climbed, a hundred times, to peep at the young birds in their nest; and the branch from which he used to shout to little Kate, who stood below terrified at the height he had gained, and yet urging him higher still by the intensity of her admiration. There was the old house too, which they would pass every day, {{looking up at the}} tiny window through which the sun used to stream in and wake him on the summer mornings--they were all summer mornings then--and climbing up the garden-wall and looking over, Nicholas could see the very rose-bush which had come, a present to Kate, from some little lover, and she had planted with her own hands. There were the hedgerows where the brother and sister had so often gathered wild flowers together, and the green fields and shady paths where they had so often strayed. There was not a lane, or brook, or copse, or cottage near, with which some childish event was not entwined, and back it came upon the mind--as events of childhood do--nothing in itself: perhaps a word, a laugh, a look, some slight distress, a passing thought or fear: and yet more strongly and distinctly marked, and better remembered, than the hardest trials or severest sorrows <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b>|$|E

60|$|The {{barriers}} being now withdrawn, {{we walked}} adown {{the length of}} the nave, which did not seem to me so dim and vast as the recollection which I have had of it since my visit <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> But my pre-imaginations and my memories are both apt to play me false with all admirable things, and so create disappointments for me, while perhaps the thing itself is really far better than I imagine or remember it. We engaged an old man, one of the attendants pertaining to the cathedral, to be our guide, and he showed us first the stone screen in front of the choir, with its sculptured kings of England; and then the tombs in the north transept,-- one of a modern archbishop, and one of an ancient one, behind which the insane person who set fire to the church a few years ago hid himself at nightfall. Then our guide unlocked a side door, and led us into the chapter-house,--an octagonal hall, with a vaulted roof, a tessellated floor, and seven arched windows of old painted glass, the richest that I ever saw or imagined, each looking like an inestimable treasury of precious stories, with a gleam and glow even in the sullen light of this gray morning. What would they be with the sun shining through them! With all their brilliancy, moreover, they were as soft as rose-leaves. I never saw any piece of human architecture so beautiful as this chapter-house; at least, I thought so while I was looking at it, and think so still; and it owed its beauty in very great measure to the painted windows: I remember looking at these windows from the outside yesterday, and seeing nothing but an opaque old crust of conglomerated panes of glass; but now that gloomy mystery was radiantly solved.|$|E
6000|$|The work {{of weeks}} is soon recorded, and when another month was gone {{these were the}} changes it had wrought. The four so strangely bound {{together}} by ties of suffering and sin went on their way, to the world's eye, blessed with every gracious gift, but below the tranquil surface rolled that undercurrent whose mysterious tides ebb and flow in human hearts unfettered by race or rank or time. Gilbert was a good actor, but, though he curbed his fitful temper, smoothed his mien, and sweetened his manner, his wife soon felt the vanity of hoping to recover that which never had been hers. Silently she accepted the fact and, uttering no complaint, turned to others for the fostering warmth without which she could not live. Conscious of a hunger like her own, Manuel could offer her sincerest sympathy, and soon learned to find a troubled pleasure {{in the knowledge that}} she loved him and her husband knew it, for his life of the emotions was rapidly maturing the boy into the man, as the fierce ardors of his native skies quicken the growth of wondrous plants that blossom in a night. Mrs. Redmond, as young in character as in years, felt the attraction of a nature generous and sweet, and yielded to it as involuntarily as an unsupported vine yields to the wind that blows it to the strong arms of a tree, still unconscious that a warmer sentiment than gratitude made his companionship the sunshine of her life. Pauline saw this, and sometimes owned within herself that she had evoked spirits which she could not rule, but her purpose drove her on, and in it she found a charm more perilously potent than before. Gilbert watched the three with a smile darker than a frown, yet no reproach warned his wife of the danger which she did not see; no jealous demonstration roused Manuel to rebel against the oppression of a presence so distasteful to him; no rash act or word gave Pauline power to banish him, though the one desire of his soul became the discovery of the key to the inscrutable expression of her eyes as they followed the young pair, whose growing friendship left their mates alone. Slowly her manner softened toward him, pity seemed to bridge across the gulf that lay between them, and in rare moments time appeared to have retraced its steps, leaving the tender woman <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>ago.</b> Nourished by such unexpected hope, the early passion throve and strengthened until it became the mastering ambition of his life, and, only pausing to make assurance doubly sure, he waited the advent of the hour when he could [...] "put his fortune to the touch and win or lose it all." ...|$|E
