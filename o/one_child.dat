2500|$|... kal va-chomer is as follows: Leviticus 18:21 {{speaks of}} the {{prohibition}} of worshiping Molech, a form of worship in which children were passed through fire (presumably until dead). Now, one would assume {{that if it were}} prohibited to pass some of <b>one's</b> <b>children</b> through the fire, surely it would be prohibited to pass all of <b>one's</b> <b>children</b> through the fire –- a kal va-chomer. However, it is derived from the verse's use of the word [...] "ומזרעך", lit. [...] "and from your seed," [...] that this prohibition is only when some of <b>one's</b> <b>children</b> are sacrificed in this worship; when all of <b>one's</b> <b>children</b> are sacrificed, this is not punishable. This is explained with the reasoning that the intention of the Molech worship is to improve {{the health and well-being of}} <b>one's</b> remaining <b>children,</b> whereas complete sacrifice defeats the purported purpose of the service, rendering it unpunishable by lack of intent to perform it properly.|$|R

5|$|Alexios {{was born}} circa 1270 {{as the second}} son of prōtovestiarios and megas domestikos Michael Tarchaneiotes. His mother, Maria, belonged to the noble family of the Philanthropenoi, which rose to {{prominence}} {{in the latter half}} of the 13th century. She was the daughter of prōtostratōr and megas doux Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos, after whom Alexios was named. On his father's side, Alexios was also closely related to the imperial family of the Palaiologoi, through his grandmother, Martha Palaiologina, a sister of Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1261).

5|$|Chen Guangcheng, a blind self-taught Weiquan lawyer, rose to {{prominence}} for defending victims of China's one-child policy. First implemented in 1979, the one-child policy mandates that couples may only have <b>one</b> <b>child,</b> {{though there are}} exceptions for some rural citizens, ethnic minorities, and couples who were themselves only children. Though Chinese laws condemn harsh enforcement measures, Chinese authorities and family planning staff {{have been accused of}} carrying out coercive, late-term forced abortions, sterilization, incarceration and torture to enforce the policy. In 2005, Chen Guangcheng filed a class action case against family planning officials in Linyi, Shandong, who were accused of subjecting thousands of women to sterilization or forced abortions.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reform}} period, the Communist regime in China {{regulated}} birth control. The government shaped policies {{with the intention}} to develop population science “through selective absorption of Western science and technology.” In 1979, the Planned Birth Policy was implemented. The Chinese government only allowed <b>one</b> <b>child</b> per Han family, with more children allowed to non-Han families. Since this planned birth policy was implemented based on local laws rather than on a national population law, the level of birth restriction differed in urban and rural areas. In families reliant on farming for income, the household is the fundamental unit of production, so many rural families would rather pay the hefty fines for excess birth.|$|E
