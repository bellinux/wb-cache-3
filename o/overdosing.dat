5|$|Drug {{overdose}} and intoxication {{are significant}} causes of accidental death, {{and can also}} be used as a form of suicide. Death can occur from <b>overdosing</b> on a single or multiple drugs, or from combined drug intoxication (CDI) due to poly drug use. Poly drug use often carries more risk than use of a single drug, due to an increase in side effects, and drug synergy. For example, the chance of death from <b>overdosing</b> on opiates is greatly increased when they are consumed in conjunction with alcohol. While they are two distinct phenomena, deaths from CDI are often misreported as overdoses. Drug overdoses and intoxication can also cause indirect deaths. For example, while marijuana does not cause fatal overdoses, being intoxicated by it can increase the chance of fatal traffic collisions.|$|E

At their wedding, an assassin attempts to shoot Victor, but Adam takes the bullet and nearly dies for his father. As a result, he offers Victor the position of co-CEO at Newman, and they begin working together. However, their partnership ends several months later when Victor discovers that Adam's silent partner used to take Newman private again was Jack. Victor fears that Adam and Jack have been scheming {{to take back the}} company for themselves without Victor. In retaliating, Victor, who now owns Chancellor Industries according to Katherine Chancellor's will, has all major Newman clients sign to Chancellor, as Victor leaves Newman worthless so he could build up Chancellor. Adam signs over his shares in Newman over to Victor, who plans to merge Chancellor Industries with Newman. Nikki then reveals she gave birth to another son decades earlier before she was with Victor, revealed to be Dylan McAvoy (Steve Burton). A subsidiary of the newly merged conglomerate, named Bonaventure Industries, later produced an illegal speed drug that Summer Newman (Hunter King) ended up <b>overdosing</b> on.

40|$|Concern {{has been}} {{expressed}} at the widespread prescribing of methadone {{in view of}} its inherent toxicity. Commentators have opined that methadone is more toxic than heroin and causes more <b>overdose</b> deaths. However, data deficiencies and flawed analyses leave continuing uncertainty about this crucial policy issue. The relative contributions of heroin, other opiates (e. g. methadone) and non-opiate drugs to <b>overdose</b> and <b>overdose</b> deaths among drug misusers were examined in a community-recruited sample of 312 injecting drug misusers in London. Data were collected on last personal <b>overdose</b> (n= 117), last witnessed <b>overdose</b> (n= 167) and last witnessed fatal <b>overdose</b> (n= 55), and on the different drugs that had been involved with these <b>overdoses.</b> Heroin was involved in 83 % of last personal <b>overdoses,</b> 90 % of last witnessed <b>overdoses</b> and 80 % of last witnessed fatal <b>overdoses,</b> while other opiates were involved in only 18 %, 8 % and 26 %, respectively. Methadone accounted for about half of these “other opiate” <b>overdoses.</b> <b>Overdoses</b> involving a combination of heroin and a non-opiate were common − 29 %, 21 % and 39 %, respectively. Heroin was the drug most frequently involved in <b>overdose</b> across all three areas of study. However, combinations of heroin and a non-opiate were surprisingly frequent, especially in witnessed fatal <b>overdoses</b> (as reported recently by other investigators using different methodologies). Considering the wide extent of methadone prescribing to this group, methadone was remarkably infrequently reported as responsible (solely or in combination) for either personal <b>overdoses,</b> witnessed <b>overdoses</b> or witnessed fatal <b>overdoses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aims Methadone {{treatment}} {{has been shown}} to be an effective intervention that can lower the risk of heroin-induced <b>overdose</b> death. Recent reports have suggested increases in methadone-induced <b>overdose</b> deaths in several locations in the USA and in Europe. This study investigated the role of methadone and opiates in accidental <b>overdose</b> deaths in New York City. Design We analysed data from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner to examine all accidental drug <b>overdose</b> deaths in New York City between 1990 and 1998. Findings Of 7451 total <b>overdose</b> deaths during this period, there were 1024 methadone-induced <b>overdose</b> deaths, 4627 heroin-induced <b>overdose</b> deaths and 408 <b>overdose</b> deaths attributed to both methadone and heroin. Fewer than a third as many accidental <b>overdose</b> deaths were attributed to methadone than were attributed to heroin during this period. The proportion of accidental <b>overdose</b> deaths attributed to methadone did not change appreciably (12. 6 – 15. 8 % of total <b>overdose</b> mortality), while the proportion of <b>overdose</b> deaths attributed to heroin increased significantly (53. 5 – 64. 2 %) during the period of study.

40|$|Background: Opioid <b>overdose</b> is {{the primary}} cause of death among drug users globally. Personal and social {{determinants}} of <b>overdose</b> have been studied before, but the environmental factors lacked research attention. Area deprivation or presence of addiction clinics may contribute to <b>overdose.</b> Objectives: To examine the baseline incidence of all new opioid <b>overdoses</b> in an ambulance service, and their relationship with urban deprivation and presence of addiction services. Methods: A prospective chart review of pre-hospital advanced life support patients was performed on confirmed opioid <b>overdose</b> calls. Demographic, geographic, and clinical information, i. e. presentation, treatment, outcomes, was collected for each call. The Census data were used to calculate deprivation. Geographical information software mapped the urban deprivation and addiction services against the <b>overdose</b> locations. Results: There were 469 <b>overdoses,</b> 13 of which were fatal; most were male (80 %), of a young age (32 years), with a high rate of repeated <b>overdoses</b> (26 %), and common poly-drug use (9. 6 %). Majority occurred in daytime (275), on the streets (212). <b>Overdoses</b> were more likely in more affluent areas (r =. 15, P <. 05), and in a 1000 m radius of addiction services. Residential <b>overdoses</b> were in more deprived areas than street <b>overdoses</b> (mean difference 7. 8, t(170) = 3. 99, P <. 001).

Comparison was made with patients attending for illicit drug <b>overdose</b> or for self-harm by means other than <b>overdose.</b> Results Medication <b>overdose</b> cases (n= 453) showed a broadly comparable profile with those found in earlier studies (predominantly female gender, aged in their 30 s and referred for psychosocial assessment). A similar though not identical profile was noted for self-harm cases (n= 545). In contrast, patients attending for illicit drug <b>overdose</b> (n= 409) could be characterised as male, in their 20 s and not referred for psychosocial assessment.

Methods We explored injection drug users' experiences with opioid <b>overdose</b> response, examining differences between <b>overdose</b> responses in which naloxone was and was not used. The current study is based upon qualitative interviews (N = 31) with clients of the Chicago Recovery Alliance needle exchange program who had witnessed an <b>overdose</b> in the past six months. The interviews explored participants' drug use history, personal <b>overdose</b> experiences, and details concerning their last witnessed <b>overdose.</b> Verbatim transcripts were coded and analyzed thematically to address major study questions. Results Participants were 81 % were male, their median age was 38. They reported having injected a median of 10 years and having witnessed a median of six <b>overdoses</b> in their lifetime. All described <b>overdoses</b> were recognized and responded to quickly. None of the <b>overdoses</b> resulted in a fatality and naloxone was successfully administered in 58 % of the last witnessed <b>overdoses.</b> Administering naloxone for the first time was characterized by trepidation, but this feeling dissipated as the naloxone quickly took effect.

40|$|Introduction and Aims. In {{response}} to {{concerns about the}} prevalence of heroin-related morbidity and mortality, <b>overdose</b> response training programs have been implemented in Victoria, {{with the aim of}} improving outcomes after heroin <b>overdose.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} examine reported <b>overdose</b> response by current injecting drug users (IDU) during <b>overdose</b> events, in comparison with previous studies. Design and Methods. A total of 99 IDU (median age 35 years, 72 % male) were administered a questionnaire that collected information on knowledge and experience regarding recognition of heroin <b>overdose</b> and response. The primary outcome measure was the rate of ambulance notification and expired air resuscitation during witnessed heroin <b>overdose.</b> Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and univariate analysis. Results. Sixty participants had <b>overdosed</b> at least once, and 84 % had witnessed an <b>overdose.</b> 78 % recognised altered consciousness as a sign of heroin <b>overdose,</b> but less were aware of depressed breathing (42 %) or cyanosis (61 %). Reported <b>overdose</b> interventions included correct positioning (39 %), expired air resuscitation (32 %), ambulance notification (76 %) and staying with the victim (87 %). Discussion and Conclusions. Our study has found improved responses to heroin <b>overdose</b> during witnessed heroin <b>overdose</b> among current IDU, compared with earlier work. However, a lack of knowledge regarding appropriate first-aid response persists, which might improve with the development and implementation of training initiatives in this area, ranging from identification of <b>overdose</b> to the administration of life-saving measures.
