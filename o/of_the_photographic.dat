5|$|In 2007, a {{researcher}} remarked that only little technical {{information is available}} about lenses, shutters and the speed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> media, but reported that Neubronner obtained the film for his panoramic camera from ADOX. For this camera he estimated a film speed of ISO 25/15°–40/17° and a shutter speed of 1/60s–1/100s. The film was cut to the format 30mm×60mm and bent into a concave shape to prevent unnecessary distortion due to the half-circle movement of the lens.|$|E
5|$|In shots {{where there}} was no {{perspective}} change, still shots of the models were photographed and positive paper prints were made. The image of the model was cut out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> print and mounted on glass and filmed on an animation stand. The undeveloped film was re-wound to film the star background with the silhouette of the model photograph acting as a matte to block out where the spaceship image was.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, two Bristol Blenheims of No. 114 Squadron RAF made {{an attack}} on Frecamp and Dieppe, {{dropping}} bombs from high altitude. The Germans recorded no damage at Frecamp, and the attack on Dieppe seems to have gone unnoticed. As the bombers headed home, they passed two Spitfires <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Photographic</b> Reconnaissance Unit (PRU). These high-speed aircraft had been stripped of non-essential weight such as armament and radios and were fitted with cameras and extra fuel tanks. They photographed ports and airfields and then returned.|$|E

25|$|Lyons {{was also}} a curator of {{photography}} and an associate director at the George Eastman House in Rochester, New York and, in 1969, founded the independent Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester, which established a course of study relating to the history and practice <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> art form and curatorial studies specifically pertaining to the medium of photography.

25|$|In the 1880s, the University of Pennsylvania {{sponsored}} Muybridge's {{research using}} banks of cameras to photograph {{people in a}} studio, and animals from the Philadelphia Zoo to study their movement. The human models, either entirely nude or very lightly clothed, were photographed against a measured grid background {{in a variety of}} action sequences, including walking up or down stairs, hammering on an anvil, carrying buckets of water, or throwing water over one another. Muybridge produced sequences showing farm, industrial, construction, and household work, military maneuvers, and everyday activities. He also photographed athletic activities such as baseball, cricket, boxing, wrestling, discus throwing, and a ballet dancer performing. Showing a single-minded dedication to scientific accuracy and artistic composition, Muybridge himself posed nude for some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> sequences, such as one showing him swinging a miner's pick.|$|E
25|$|The {{activities}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Photographic</b> Section continued after 1961 when {{it became}} the West Cameroon Photographic Section (part of the Federal Republic) and thereafter, under the United Republic of Cameroon (formed after a referendum in 1972). The photographers working for the Information Service produced not only photographs but also movies, which were subsequently shown by mobile cinemas units in rural and urban areas all over the territory. These movies' primary purpose was the information and education of the population about matters such as health, hygiene or the importance of schooling. These photographers were also responsible for covering the Presidents’ and Prime Minister’s activities {{as well as any}} official events of public interest. From its inception and through the 1980s the Photographic Division was active and able to preside directly over all the phases of photo production, from shooting to development and print.|$|E
25|$|The {{tradition}} of dressing up in character {{continued into the}} following centuries. One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> series by Julia Margaret Cameron, a pupil of the painter George Frederic Watts, was of mythical characters, for whom she used the children of friends and servants as models. Young Kate Keown sat for the head of “Circe” in about 1865 and is pictured wearing a grape and vineleaf headdress to suggest the character’s use of wine to bring a change in personality. The society portrait photographer Yevonde Middleton, also known as Madame Yevonde, was to use a 1935 aristocratic charity ball {{as the foundation for}} her own series of mythological portraits in colour. Its participants were invited to her studio afterwards to pose in their costumes. There Baroness Dacre is pictured as Circe with a leafy headdress about golden ringlets and clasping a large Baroque porcelain goblet.|$|E

25|$|His {{international}} {{reputation and}} his signature photographic passions were established by four key books {{published in the}} 1960s. Five Girls (1962) explored a fresh approach to photographing the nude female figure and contained important first explorations with black-and-white printing, cropping and book design, which were a key feature of his subsequent books. Cowboy Kate & Other Stories (1964) was probably the first book to deliberately explore black-and-white photographic grain as a medium for expression and image design. It was highly influential at the time, sold roughly a million copies worldwide and won the Prix Nadar in France in 1964. It continues to influence contemporary photographers, film makers, fashion designers and make-up artists. Cowboy Kate & Other Stories or 'Kate' as the book is often referred to, had its place in photographic history cemented in 2005 when the International Center of Photography in New York included the book in their exhibition The Open Book: A History <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Photographic</b> Book from 1878 to the Present.|$|E
25|$|In the 1890s, Aimé Dupont began {{suffering}} from stomach cancer. Just {{prior to a}} sitting with Emma Eames, he fell ill {{and was unable to}} work. Despite never having done photography work before, Etta Dupont stepped in and successfully kept the appointment. From then on, she would be responsible for posing the subjects. Dupont died of his condition on 16 February 1900. Afterwards, Etta became the photographer for the business (and in later years, their son Albert also took his turn behind the camera), keeping the name Aimé Dupont Studio. For many years, a number <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> subjects were under the belief that she was Aimé Dupont. Her endeavors proved to be successful enough for her to open another studio in Newport, Rhode Island, photographing socialites when she closed the New York studio for the summers. However, in 1906 the Metropolitan Opera, the studio's primary client, hired its own photographer, and without the artistic direction of Dupont, the business began to suffer. Finally, in 1920, Etta had to declare bankruptcy. She sold the business to an investor, and the name Aimé Dupont Studio continued as a portrait studio until the 1950s.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} {{exposure time}} {{depended on the}} lighting conditions, the sensitivity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> plate, and the camera lens aperture used. In a letter to Leo Tolstoy requesting a portrait sitting, Prokudin-Gorsky described the exposure as taking one to three seconds, but later, when recollecting his time with Tolstoy, he described a six-second exposure on a sunny day. Blaise Agüera y Arcas studied one landscape view, photographed in broad daylight but showing a clear, well-defined moon, and used the moon's movement to estimate that the whole procedure of three filtered exposures and two repositionings of the camera's plate holder had taken over a minute. The lens aperture Prokudin-Gorsky chose to use greatly affected the exposure time required. A small aperture is often used for landscape photography because it allows objects at various distances to all be sharply imaged at the same time, while {{the use of a}} large aperture is common for portraiture and plainly evident in the Tolstoy portrait. All other factors being equal, if for example a 16-second exposure was required when using a 1/4-inch-diameter aperture, an exposure of only 1 second would suffice with a 1-inch aperture.|$|E

25|$|Coastal Command Spitfires and Lockheed Hudsons <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Photographic</b> Reconnaissance Unit {{flew from}} Norway to the Spanish border to {{photograph}} German-occupied ports, {{looking for signs}} of invasion preparations. Nothing was revealed until the second week of August, when accumulations of barges were found and interpreted as an invasion preparation. In the meantime, Bomber Command sent its bombers nightly against the German ports, aircraft industry and airfields when unable to bomb the primary target. The Blenheims of 2 Group made daylight attacks on airfields occupied by the Luftwaffe. In July ports and shipping were made the priority target but until the ports filled with invasion craft in August, Bomber Command continued to attack industry and Luftwaffe ground facilities. The Germans had 400 airfields available and dispersed aircraft around them, making bombing ineffectual. These targets were defended by large concentrations of anti-aircraft artillery, making ground strafing too risky. The Blenheims were vulnerable to fighter attack and the crews had orders to abandon raids unless there was 7/10ths cloud {{and by the end of}} June, 90 percent of sorties were cancelled. The Blenheims—with some Fairey Battles returned from France—began to fly on moonlit nights. In July 1940, Bomber Command lost 72 aircraft carrying out these operations.|$|E
25|$|The CPPA-B {{was founded}} in 1954 by the British colonial {{administration}} when Southern Cameroons was granted quasi regional status and started operating in November 1955. The person responsible for the setting up of the archives (more precisely the Photo Section within the Southern Cameroons Information Service) was Emmanuel Moanga Mbwaye (1928-2016) who had trained as a photographer in the Colonial Film Unit while working with the Cameroon Development Cooperation (C.D.C.) which had been formed in 1947 {{with the objective of}} developing and running plantations of tropical crops in Cameroon. Mbwaye worked alone from the early years but was joined in 1961 by Scott Fominyam. The latter was an assistant-photographer to Mbwaye and, in 1974, was transferred to Bamenda to set up the North West regional office <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Photographic</b> Section. Mbwaye was frequently sent out of office to cover events. Scheduling clashes meant he was unable to effectively do the work alone and this necessitated the contracting of studio photographers such as Batanwi Photos (South West in Victoria now Limbe) and CC Sports (North West in Bamenda). The mandate of the photographers of the Press Photo Agency was to follow any governmental or otherwise socially relevant events throughout its territory (today’s Northwest and Southwest Regions).|$|E

In the mid-1940s, since {{he was not able}} to gain admission to day session classes at colleges, he briefly attended evening classes at the City College of New York. Eventually, he sold a photographic series to Look magazine, having taken a photo to Helen O'Brian, head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>photographic</b> department, who purchased it without hesitation for £25 on the spot. It was printed on June 26, 1945. Kubrick supplemented his income by playing chess [...] "for quarters" [...] in Washington Square Park and various Manhattan chess clubs.|$|E
