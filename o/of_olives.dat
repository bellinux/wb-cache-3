5|$|After {{the failure}} of the initial assault, a meeting between the various leaders was {{organized}} in which it was agreed upon that a more concerted attack would be required in the future. On 17 June, a party of Genoese mariners under Guglielmo Embriaco arrived at Jaffa, and provided the Crusaders with skilled engineers, and perhaps more critically, supplies of timber (stripped from the ships) to build siege engines. The Crusaders' morale was raised when a priest, Peter Desiderius, claimed to have had a divine vision, of Bishop Adhemar, instructing them to fast and then march in a barefoot procession around the city walls, after which the city would fall, following the Biblical story of Joshua at the siege of Jericho. After a three-day fast, on 8 July the crusaders performed the procession as they had been instructed by Desiderius, ending on the Mount <b>of</b> <b>Olives</b> where Peter the Hermit preached to them, and shortly afterward the various bickering factions arrived at a public rapprochement. News arrived shortly after that a Fatimid relief army had set off from Egypt, giving the Crusaders a very strong incentive to make another assault on the city.|$|E

5|$|On October 24, 1979, church {{president}} Spencer W. Kimball visited Jerusalem {{to dedicate}} the Orson Hyde Memorial Gardens, {{located on the}} Mount <b>of</b> <b>Olives.</b> The church had donated money to beautify the Jerusalem area, and officials of the Jerusalem government were present at the occasion. It was at this dedication that Kimball announced the church's intent to build a center for BYU students in the city. Negotiations between {{the church and the}} Israeli government stretched from 1980-1984. The land the church wanted for the center, located at the northwestern margin of Mount Olivet, right next to the valley which separates it from Mount Scopus, had been acquired by Israel during the Six Day War of 1967 and could not be sold under Israeli law. The church decided to obtain a lease on the land instead. Leasing the land also prevented the politically controversial problem of the church owning a piece of Jerusalem land. Israeli officials saw the building of the center on the land as a way of solidifying control over land whose ownership was ambiguous under international law. By August 1984, the church had the land on a 49-year lease, building permits had been obtained, and construction on the building began.|$|E
5|$|The Provence and Côte d'Azur {{region is}} rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits, and herbs; the region {{is one of the}} largest {{suppliers}} of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount <b>of</b> <b>olives,</b> and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, tarragon, oregano, and bay leaf. Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in Poulet Provençal, which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert, e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and fougasse.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} source mentioning {{this specific}} site {{as a place}} of worship is from the 16th century. The previous sites used by Jews for mourning the destruction of the Temple, during periods when access to the city was prohibited to them, lay to the east, on the Mount <b>of</b> <b>Olives</b> and in the Kidron Valley below it. From the mid-19th century onwards, attempts to purchase rights to the wall and its immediate area were made by various Jews, but none was successful. With the rise of the Zionist movement in the early 20th century, the wall became a source of friction between the Jewish and Muslim communities, the latter being worried that the wall could be used to further Jewish claims to the Temple Mount and thus Jerusalem. During this period outbreaks of violence {{at the foot of the}} wall became commonplace, with a particularly deadly riot in 1929 in which 133 Jews were killed and 339 injured. After the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Eastern portion of Jerusalem was occupied by Jordan. Under Jordanian control Jews were completely expelled from the Old City including the Jewish quarter, and Jews were barred from entering the Old City for 19 years, effectively banning Jewish prayer at the site of the Western Wall. This period ended on June 10, 1967, when Israel gained control of the site following the Six-Day War. Three days after establishing control over the Western Wall site the Moroccan Quarter was bulldozed by Israeli authorities to create space for what is now the Western Wall plaza.|$|E

25|$|In 1971, Georg Kretschmar {{proposed}} {{a connection between}} the Christian custom of praying towards the east and a practice of the earliest Christians in Jerusalem of praying towards the Mount <b>of</b> <b>Olives,</b> situated to the east of the city and seen as the locus of key eschatological events and of the Second Coming of Christ. In this view, the localization of the Second Coming on the Mount <b>of</b> <b>Olives</b> was abandoned after the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70 and the eastward direction of Christian prayer became general. The theory of Christian prayer towards the Mount <b>of</b> <b>Olives</b> has been rejected by Stefan Heid, but is defended by Uwe Michael Lang.

30|$|The {{chemical}} composition <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> solid waste {{depends on the}} year, season, variety, proportion of branches of tree, storage condition, drying procedure, climatic conditions, moisture content, and degree of contamination with soil [28].

40|$|Objective: We {{reviewed}} the bioavailability and antioxidant effects of phenols from {{extra virgin olive}} oil. Search strategy: We searched the MEDLINE database for the years 1966 - 2002. To review the bioavailability <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> oil phenols, we selected animal and human studies that studied the absorption, metabolism, and urinary excretion <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> oil phenols. We also estimated the intake of the various phenols in the Mediterranean area. To review the antioxidant effects <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> oil phenols, we included human and animal studies on the effect <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> oil phenols on markers of oxidative processes in the body. We excluded studies without a proper control treatment and studies in which the antioxidant effects of phenols could not be disentangled {{from those of the}} fatty acid composition <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> oil. Results: Bioavailability studies in humans show that the absorption <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> oil phenols is probably larger than 55 - 66 mol%, and that at least 5 % is excreted in urine as tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol. Animal studies suggest that phenol-rich olive oil lowers oxidisability of ex vivo low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles or lowers markers in urine of oxidative processes in the body. In five out of seven human studies, however, these effects of phenols were not found. There are no data on the phenol concentrations in plasma that are attainable by intake <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> oil. We estimated that 50 g <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> oil per day provides about 2 mg or similar to 13 mumol of hydroxytyrosol-equivalents per day, and that the plasma concentration <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> oil phenols with antioxidant potential resulting from such an intake can be at most 0. 06 mumol/l. This is much lower than the minimum concentrations of these phenols (50 - 100 mmol) required to show antioxidant activity in vitro. Conclusion: Although phenols from olive oil seem to be well absorbed, the content <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> oil phenols with antioxidant potential in the Mediterranean diet is probably too low to produce a measurable effect on LDL oxidisability or other oxidation markers in humans. The available evidence does not suggest that consumption of phenols in the amounts provided by dietary olive oil will protect LDL against oxidative modification to any important extent...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to remove Cd(II) ions from aqueous {{solutions}} by adsorption. Mixed sorbent prepared from olive stone and date pit, an agricultural solid by-product was used as adsorbent. The adsorption experiments of Cd(II) onto the mixture <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> stone and date pit were conducted at different parameters such as, percent <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> stone and date pit in the mixture, temperature, initial solution pH and initial Cd(II) concentration. Adsorption isotherms were obtained at different percent <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> stone and date pit in the mixture. This adsorption data was fitted with the Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherms. The thermodynamic of Cadmium sorption on the mixed sorbent follows the Langmuir model and the sorption capacity for cadmium increases when we add a small amount <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> stone at date pits (90 % of date pits in mixture and 10 % <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> stone) and a small amount of date pits at olive stone (90 % <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> stone and 10 % of date pits in mixture. In addition, the thermodynamic parameters, standard free energy (°G°), standard enthalpy (ΔH°) and standard entropy (ΔS°) of the adsorption process were calculated. The sorption of Cd(II) onto the mixture <b>of</b> <b>olive</b> stones and dates pit is spontaneous and presents an endothermic nature. The characteristics of the mixture were determined by the analysis of infra red spectral analysis.
