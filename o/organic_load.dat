30|$|As {{shown in}} Table  3, the proper final pH values {{for all the}} groups in this study might be because the AD system could adjust pH {{gradually}} to some extent and an appropriate initial pH is easier for microorganism to adjust it into proper range. The low value of VFA (lower than 5000  mg L− 1) and VFA/TA indicated the high <b>organic</b> <b>loading</b> and F/I ratio {{in this study were}} acceptable for AD and no inhibition was happened. It is obvious that a high <b>organic</b> <b>loading</b> may lead to relatively higher TAN value while a relatively high F/I ratio could buffer the high TAN contribution of high <b>organic</b> <b>loading.</b> At condition of <b>organic</b> <b>loading</b> of 30  gVS L− 1, F/I ratio of 0.5, and initial pH of 7, the AD system showed a TAN value of 910  mg L− 1, which already reached the edge of proper range. If the <b>organic</b> <b>loading</b> increased continually at F/I ratio of 0.5, the TAN value could probably exceed over 1000  mg L− 1 and AD might be inhibited. That could be a good explanation for the downtrend of methane production when <b>organic</b> <b>loading</b> higher than 31.49  gVS L− 1 at F/I ratio of 0.5. Similarly, owing to the buffering of high F/I ratio, the TAN value of high <b>organic</b> <b>loading</b> group (more than 40  gVS L− 1) may not be too high (lower than 1000  mg L− 1), thus AD efficiency was not inhibited by TAN.

30|$|As the {{by-product}} of the vinegar production process, {{a large number}} of vinegar residue has been abandoned and caused a serious environmental pollution. Anaerobic digestion has been proved to be able to dispose and convert vinegar residue into bioenergy but still need to improve the efficiency. This study applied central composite design of response surface methodology to investigate the influences of feed to inoculum ratio, <b>organic</b> <b>loading,</b> and initial pH on methane production and optimize anaerobic digestion condition. The maximum methane yield of 203.91  mL gVS− 1 and biodegradability of 46.99 % were obtained at feed to inoculum ratio of 0.5, <b>organic</b> <b>loading</b> of 31.49  gVS L− 1, and initial pH of 7.29, which was considered as the best condition. It has a very significant improvement of 69.48 % for methane production and 52.02 % for biodegradability compared with our previous study. Additionally, a high methane yield of 182.09  mL gVS− 1 was obtained at feed to inoculum ratio of 1.5, <b>organic</b> <b>loading</b> of 46.22 gVS L− 1, and initial pH of 7.32. And it is more appropriate to apply this condition in industrial application owing to the high feed to inoculum ratio and <b>organic</b> <b>loading.</b> Besides, a significant interaction was found between feed to inoculum ratio and <b>organic</b> <b>loading.</b> This study maximized the methane production of vinegar residue and made a good foundation for further study and future industrial application.|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{anaerobic}} digestion efficiency of VR on methane production was improved by using response surface methodology {{and the interaction}} among feed to inoculum ratio, <b>organic</b> <b>loading,</b> and initial pH was also investigated in this study. Results showed that the best condition was feed to inoculum ratio of 0.5, <b>organic</b> <b>loading</b> of 31.49  gVS L− 1, and initial pH of 7.29, which achieved the maximum methane yield of 203.91  mL gVS− 1 and Bd of 46.99 %. It increased by 69.48 and 52.02 % compared with our previous study, respectively. The feed to inoculum ratio and <b>organic</b> <b>loading</b> showed a significant interaction on methane production. Additionally, high feed to inoculum ratio of 1.5 and <b>organic</b> <b>loading</b> more than 40  gVS L− 1 were confirmed effectively for {{anaerobic digestion}} of vinegar residue and showed a possibility of using them in future industrial application. The findings of this research provided useful information for both fundamental study and industrial application for AD of VR waste, which could not only reduce its pollution, but also facilitate its conversion to renewable energy.|$|R
