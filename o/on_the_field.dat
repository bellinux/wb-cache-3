5|$|A {{controversial}} fumble recovery by Sewanee {{may have}} saved the game. Auburn quarterback Reynolds Tichenor {{said it was a}} gift; the referee awarded Sewanee the ball, but he insisted Auburn recovered it. A double pass play to Warbler Wilson got the ensuing Sewanee touchdown. Bart Sims made the extra point to edge Auburn. Neither team managed to score in the second half. The delay from the crowd gathering <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> ran the game into darkness.|$|E

5|$|A {{forward is}} a player {{position}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> whose responsibility is primarily offensive. Typically, a forward is dominant throwing {{with one hand}} or the other, and will primarily play {{on that side of}} the floor. Some players, known as creasemen, do not focus on one side or the other. These players instead focus their offensive attention near the crease area in front of the goaltender.|$|E
5|$|A right-arm fast bowler, Halcombe {{moved from}} South Australia to Western Australia after two seasons {{due to a}} lack of opportunity. With more regular {{selection}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> Halcombe was considered a leading contender to become his state's first ever representative for Australia in Test cricket due to his express pace, but his career was derailed after he was no balled for throwing in two consecutive matches in early 1930.|$|E

5|$|Although the Giants were {{successful}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> {{in their first}} season, going 8–4, their financial status was a different story. Overshadowed by baseball, boxing, and college football, professional football was not a popular sport in 1925. They were in dire financial straits until the eleventh game of the season, when Red Grange and the Chicago Bears came to town, attracting over 73,000 fans. This gave the Giants a much needed influx of revenue, and perhaps altered {{the history of the}} franchise.|$|E

In the early battles, some Confederate units that wore dark blue uniforms were often mistaken <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field</b> of battle for the enemy. Conversely, many Union units that were originally militia units went to war wearing gray.|$|E

5|$|Culverhouse {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} team owners in the NFL, and was credited with modernizing the league, even while his teams were rarely competitive <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field.</b> He oversaw the league's course of direction through two player strikes, and the modern league's financial stability is in great part due to his leadership. He held influence for over a decade, before stepping back due to criticism of what other owners saw as his overly-secretive ways.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his success}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>field,</b> Macartney {{still had a}} regular job outside of cricket, as with most cricketers of the era.
