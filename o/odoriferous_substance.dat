5000|$|There is {{some doubt}} {{as to whether the}} onycha of the Old Testament was {{actually}} the operculum of a sea snail. [...] H.J. Abrahams says, [...] "The widely held mollusk hypothesis becomes quite perplexing if one considers that the mollusk was counted among the unclean animals in the Bible (Chapters Leviticus 11:9 and 12)." [...] Sea creatures such as the mollusk were an “abomination” and even their carcasses were to be considered an “abomination” and anyone simply touching them became unclean. Rabbeinu Bachyei insisted that only kosher species may be used for the mishkan. The Gemara states that “only items that one may eat may be used for the work of Heaven.” Nachmanides, Torah scholar and famed Jewish theologian, emphasized that the commandment concerning unclean animals pertained also to temple services. James Strong and J. McClintoch write that “it seems improbable that any such substance could {{have been one of the}} constituent spices of the most holy perfume; not only because we know of none bearing any powerful and agreeable odor, but specially because all marine creatures that were not finned and scaled fishes were unclean, and as such could not have been touched by the priests or used in the sanctuary.” [...] There is also some doubt that a mollusk would have been referred to as a sweet spice. Bahr states that “the odor of the burned shells is not pleasant.” [...] Although the word onycha has been interpreted as meaning [...] "nail" [...] it is pointed out that nail or claw is actually an extended connotation of onyx, derived from the translucent and sometimes veined appearance of the gemstone onyx which antiquity often describes as a black stone. Coincidentally onycha is the Greek word which was chosen to replace the original Hebrew word which was shecheleth. One of the Hebrew words that shecheleth seems to be related to, שחלים, sh'chalim, refers to a large variety of plants. An ancient Ugaritic text lists onycha among types of vegetables, implying that onycha was a vegetable also. The Talmud specifically states that although onycha (shecheleth) is not from a tree, it does grow from the ground and that it is a plant (Kerithoth 6b). Condor writes “Shecheleth, Exod. xxx. 34; is rendered by the Septuagint, onycha, and by the Arabic version, ladana [...] [...] [...] The root of the Hebrew word means to drop or distil, and shecheleth would seem, therefore, to mean some exudation.” James Strong writes [...] "the Syriac etymology of the word, namely, to run in drops, exude, distil, would lead to the idea of a resinous and <b>odoriferous</b> <b>substance</b> of the vegetable kingdom." [...] Another writer says “the context and the etymology seem to require the gum of some aromatic plant, perhaps gum-ladanum. The Hebrew word would seem to mean something that exuded, having odorous qualities.” [...] "Shecheleth" [...] identifies with the Syriac [...] "shehelta" [...] which is translated as “a tear, distillation, or exudation." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{olfactory}} {{segment is}} lined with a specialized type of pseudostratified columnar epithelium, known as olfactory epithelium, which contains receptors for {{the sense of the}} smell. This segment is located in and beneath the mucosa of the roof of each nasal cavity and the medial side of each middle turbinate. Histological sections appear yellowish-brown due to the presence of lipofuscin pigments. Olfactory mucosal cell types include bipolar neurons, supporting (sustentacular) cells, basal cells, and Bowman's glands. The axons of the bipolar neurons form the olfactory nerve (cranial nerve I) which enters the brain through the cribiform plate. Bowman's glands are serous glands in the lamina propria, whose secretions trap and dissolve <b>odoriferous</b> <b>substances.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The rabbit {{mating system}} is rather complex. Dominant males exhibit polygyny, whereas lower-status {{individuals}} (males and females) often form monogamous breeding relationships. Rabbits signal {{when they are}} ready to copulate by marking inanimate objects while giving off <b>odoriferous</b> <b>substances</b> though their chin gland, a process known as [...] "chinning". Dominance hierarchies exist in parallel for both males and females. Social rank is based on the amount of group aggression. The dominant buck has greater mobility and more aggression than the dominant doe. This is likely because males have to fight each other for the females. The social hierarchy of males is also determined by a number of other factors, such as the size of his patrol area, the number of females that visit his area, resting time near females, the number of shelters he visits, and the distance he travels daily.|$|R
40|$|Male Neotropical orchid bees (Euglossini) collect {{volatile}} chemicals from floral and non-floral {{sources and}} store then in specialized hind tibial structures. The ultimate causes of euglossine fragrance collection remain a mystery. Recent {{evidence suggests that}} <b>odoriferous</b> <b>substances</b> {{play a role in}} euglossine courtship and serve as indicator of male genetic quality. Males of Eulaema nigrita were observed robbing scents from the detached hind legs of a conspecific male E. nigrita in Belém, Brazil. The hind leg seemed to have been detached during fights between males, since one male was missing a hind leg where the observation was made. This behavior appears to be common among males of E. nigrita since more than one case was observed on the same day. The observation reported here shows that males of E. nigrita with tibiae filled with fragrances are attacked by conspecific males that attempt to steal it...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the occurrence of Euglossina’s species in a fragment of Araucaria Forest in Southern Brazil. Were determined eight sampling points in the Parque Municipal das Araucárias, which installed a set of traps containing <b>odoriferous</b> <b>substances</b> used as attractive (eugenol, eucalyptol, and vanillin).  We collected 35 male specimens belonging to two species: Eulaema nigrita (n = 34) and Euglossa fimbriata (n = 1).  Our findings add important information about the activity of Euglossina in the Araucaria Forest, since the occurrence of these bees is unprecedented for the region of Guarapuava.

40|$|The {{olfactory}} epithelium {{of mammals}} is simple in appearance when fixed and stained with conventional techniques and viewed {{with the light}} microscope. In it, there are three types of cells, the olfactory receptors, the supporting, and the basal cells, all of which rest upon a thin basement membrane, demonstrable only with difficulty (1 - 5). In spite of its apparently simple organization and single type of receptor element, the olfactory epithelium is capable of remarkably fine sensory discriminations. Olfactory receptors respond to stimulating substances in extraordinarily small concentration. Moreover, the receptors are sensitive to an enormous range of <b>odoriferous</b> <b>substances.</b> Electrophysiological investigations (6 - 9) have led several investigators to suggest recently that discrimination depends upon the existence {{of different types of}} olfactory receptors with selective sensitivities to basic odors, and although the spatial distribution of receptors may account for coarse discriminations of odors, fine differentiation seems to depend upon specific sensitivity of individual receptors to particular molecular configurations (9) ...|$|R
40|$|The Brazilian broiler {{industry}} {{is the most}} prominent branch in farming, due to its high levels of productivity. However, {{there is a growing}} concern about the environmental damages caused by such an activity, in special the atmospheric air pollution, {{as a consequence of the}} high volume of residues generated and the damages made to the environment. Air pollution, despite being most of the time detected by undesirable <b>odoriferous</b> <b>substances,</b> can be caused by numerous atmospheric pollutants such as particulate matter, odorless gases, non-volatile compounds, amongst others. This negatively impacts the health of both humans and animals, as well as of the surrounding ecosystem. Broiler production can be understood as a range of steps necessary to poultry meat production. Hence, their emissions can be computed all the way from the grain production, the feed fabrication, the poultry farming to, finally, the slaughtering and recycling of animal based products. As the poultry chain is well-segmented in its functions, it is necessary to establish and quantify the real impacts caused by its sectors and define mitigation controlling measures in regards to air pollutants...|$|R
40|$|Insects {{rely on the}} {{olfactory}} system to detect a vast diversity of airborne molecules in their environment. Highly sensitive olfactory tuning is expected to evolve when detection of a particular chemical with great precision is required {{in the context of}} foraging and/or finding mates. Male neotropical orchid bees (Euglossini) collect <b>odoriferous</b> <b>substances</b> from multiple sources, store them in specialized tibial pouches and later expose them at display sites, presumably as mating signals to females. Previous analysis of tibial compounds among sympatric species revealed substantial chemical disparity in chemical composition among lineages with outstanding divergence between closely related species. Here, we tested whether specific perfume phenotypes coevolve with matching olfactory adaptations in male orchid bees to facilitate the location and harvest of species-specific perfume compounds. We conducted electroantennographic (EAG) measurements on males of 15 sympatric species in the genus Euglossa that were stimulated with 18 compounds present in variable proportions in male hind tibiae. Antennal response profiles were species-specific across all 15 species, but there was no conspicuous differentiation between closely related species. Instead, we found that the observed variation in EAG activity follows a Brownian motion model of trait evolution, where the probability of differentiation increases proportionally with lineage divergence time. However, we identified strong antennal responses for some chemicals that are present as major compounds in the perfume of the same species, thus suggesting that sensory specialization has occurred within multiple lineages. This sensory specialization was particularly apparent for semi-volatile molecules ('base note' compounds), thus supporting the idea that such compounds {{play an important role in}} chemical signaling of euglossine bees. Overall, our study found no close correspondence between antennal responses and behavioral preferences/tibial contents, but confirms the utility of EAG profiling for discovering certain behaviorally active compounds...|$|R
40|$|In {{ordinary}} histological preparations the olfactory epithelium {{of mammals}} {{appears to have}} a relatively uniform structure throughout its extent, and, as in Man and the higher Primates, it may be disposed quite evenly in flat sheets which are uncomplicated by folds of turbinal processes. In spite of the apparent homogeneity of its composition, the discriminative potentiality of the epithelium is remarkable, for it permits the distinction and recognition by their odoriferous properties of a seemingly indefinite number of chemical substances (many of which have a comparatively simple molecular structure). The olfactory receptors and their connexions with the olfactory centres of the brain thus present a particularly interesting problem {{for the study of the}} morphological basis of sensory discrimination. Presumably the receptors are in some manner capable of functioning as "analysers" which are differentially sensitive to diverse <b>odoriferous</b> <b>substances,</b> for on a priori consideration this seems to be the most likely basis for the discriminatory functions of the olfactory epithelium. Such an hypothesis is also consonant with the phenomenon of selective olfactory fatigue. In recent years direct evidence that the olfactory receptors are not all equally sensitive to specific odorous substances has accrued from the electrophysiological studies of Adrian,. Beidler and Tucker, 5 and Ottoson"; for example, some receptors are reported to have a higher threshold of sensitivity for a particular chemical substance and other adjacent elements, a lower threshold. According to Adrian, also, these different types of receptor are not uniformly distributed over the olfactory epithelium, though there are some regions in which they are closely intermingled. This evidence that the olfactory receptors are not functionally homogeneous naturally raises the question whether they show any corresponding differentiation in their morphology and connexions. It was partly with thes...|$|R
2500|$|The {{first known}} {{use of the}} word [...] "aromatic" [...] as a {{chemical}} term—namely, to apply to compounds that contain the phenyl group—occurs in an article by August Wilhelm Hofmann in 1855. If this is indeed the earliest introduction of the term, it is curious that Hofmann says nothing about why he introduced an adjective indicating olfactory character to apply to a group of chemical substances only some of which have notable aromas. Also, many of the most <b>odoriferous</b> organic <b>substances</b> known are terpenes, which are not aromatic in the chemical sense. But terpenes and benzenoid substances do have a chemical characteristic in common, namely higher unsaturation than many aliphatic compounds, and Hofmann may not have been making a distinction between the two categories. Many of the earliest-known examples of aromatic compounds, such as benzene and toluene, have distinctive pleasant smells. This property led to the term [...] "aromatic" [...] for this class of compounds, and hence the term [...] "aromaticity" [...] for the eventually discovered electronic property.|$|R
