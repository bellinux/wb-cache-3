5|$|David Darts {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in {{an article}} for Studies in Art Education, and wrote that queries over artistic value as balanced against a desire to protect attendees of educational institutions from perceived harm repeatedly came up over {{time in the history}} of censorship.

Pipeline maps were frequently created by welders working on the pipeline, and the maps were frequently sold to tourists or given away as gifts.

5|$|Because of Nintendo's solid {{infrastructure}} for the DS, Igarashi {{wanted to try}} the online components, and test for possible online game play, in future Castlevania titles. Igarashi commented the two player game play was homage to , his favorite Castlevania game. The anime style <b>of</b> <b>artwork</b> was retained from Dawn of Sorrow, which Igarashi had switched to in the previous title to appeal more to the younger demographics of the Nintendo handheld systems.

5|$|However, not {{all forms}} <b>of</b> <b>artwork</b> {{along the highway}} were uncontroversial. In 1977, there were several {{complaints}} regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway, since they blocked {{the view of the}} coast. In 1981, an illegal mural that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I-8 interchange; while Caltrans discouraged the painting of such murals, they were impressed with the portion that had already been completed. Art Cole, the artist, stepped forward to the department, and was allowed to finish the mural of a desert highland sunrise; following this, Caltrans made efforts to have other murals commissioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} originated {{during a}} period marked by Harrison's devotion to a Hindu-aligned ascetic life and {{the height of his}} public association with the Hare Krishna movement, which included his donation of Bhaktivedanta Manor for use as an ISKCON temple. In his lyrics, Harrison sings of the falsehood of striving for wealth or power in the material world and advocates a direct relationship with one's deity as a genuine life goal. In doing so, he belittles the role of political leaders, as well as his own status as a celebrated rock musician. The song's Krishna Conscious message was also reflected in Harrison's choice <b>of</b> <b>artwork</b> for the Material World album, specifically the reproduction of a painting from a Prabhupada-published edition of the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E

He removes the larvae from their original cases and adds precious and semi-precious items such as grains of gold into the tank. The larvae then build new cases out of precious items, creating a unique form <b>of</b> <b>artwork.</b> The resulting works are sold across the world.|$|E
5|$|Square {{accumulated}} four SGI Origin 2000 series servers, four Onyx2 systems, and 167 Octane workstations for the film's production. The basic {{film was}} rendered at a custom render farm created by Square in Hawaii. It housed 960 Pentium III-933MHz workstations. Character movements were filmed using motion capture technology. Animator Matthew Hackett stated that while motion capture was effective {{for many of}} the scenes, in others animators still had to add movements manually. Hand and facial movements were all done manually. Some of General Hein's facial features and poses were based on Hackett. As animators did not want to use any actual photographs in the film, all backgrounds were done using matte paintings. 1,327 scenes in total needed to be filmed to animate the digital characters. The film consists of 141,964 frames, with each frame taking an average of 90 minutes to render. By the end of production Square had a total of 15 terabytes <b>of</b> <b>artwork</b> for the film. It is estimated that over the film's four-year production, approximately 200 people put in a combined 120 years of work on it.|$|E
5|$|TSR {{decided to}} create a franchise, {{including}} modules, board games, lead figures, andfor the first timenovels. Weis had been hired as an editor; with Hickman, she began working with the author hired to write the novels. They weren't satisfied with the author, and decided they should {{be the ones to}} write the books. They collaborated over a weekend, writing the prologue for the first five chapters of the first novel, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, based on the module Dragons of Despair. TSR liked their treatment and gave them the assignment, firing the author. After two years of development, TSR released Dragons of Autumn Twilight as a supplement to the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons game. TSR had doubts about the finished novel's sales potential, and attempted to order thirty thousand copies, ultimately ordering the minimum print run of fifty thousand. The success of the novel prompted TSR to publish more copies to meet demand. Dragonlance eventually received ancillary products such as novels, calendars, computer games, and books <b>of</b> <b>artwork.</b>|$|E
