50|$|When {{automobiles}} {{first started}} shipping with <b>on-board</b> <b>GPS</b> systems, {{it was not}} uncommon to use a forcing function which prevented the user from interacting with the GPS (such as entering in a destination) while the car was in motion. This ensures that the driver's attention is not distracted by the GPS. However, many drivers found this feature irksome, and the forcing function has largely been abandoned. This reinforces the idea that forcing functions are not always the best approach to shaping behavior.|$|E

Sinclair Interplanetary's SS-411 sun sensor and ST-16 star tracker both have applications for CubeSats and have flight heritage. Pumpkin's Colony I Bus uses an aerodynamic wing for passive attitude stabilization. Determination of a CubeSat's location can be done through the use of <b>on-board</b> <b>GPS,</b> which is relatively expensive for a CubeSat, or by relaying radar tracking data to the craft from Earth-based tracking systems.|$|E
50|$|The {{tracking}} {{project was}} launched on 8 September 2008. The project tracked a standard 40 ft shipping container {{as it was}} transported by the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) shipping line using intermodal freight transport with various cargoes. An <b>on-board</b> <b>GPS</b> unit tracked the Box's location and this was used to update a map showing the current location and previous route. If the container's GPS or communications signal was obstructed (such as having been stacked too far inside the ship's hold), the ship's own GPS location was being used to manually update a map. The tracking unit suffered technical problems during December 2008.|$|E
50|$|Because their {{geostationary}} orbit {{does not provide}} a relative motion between a distress beacon and a GEOSAR satellite, there is no opportunity to use the Doppler effect to calculate the location of a beacon. Therefore, the GEOSAR satellites only can relay a beacon’s distress message. If the beacon is a model with a feature to report its location (e.g., from an <b>on-board</b> <b>GPS</b> receiver) then that location is relayed to SAR authorities. While the inability to independently locate a beacon is a drawback of GEOSAR satellites, those satellites have an advantage in that the present constellation well covers the entire Earth in real time, except for the polar regions.|$|E

A team of four kite enthusiasts flew a 120 sq ft kite to 16009 ft above ground level.The record {{altitude}} was reached after 8 series of attempts over a ten-year period from a remote location in western NSW, Australia. The 8.2 ft tall and 19.6 ft wide Dunton-Taylor delta kite's flight was controlled by a winch system using 40682 ft of ultra high strength Dyneema line. The flight took about eight hours from ground and return. The height was measured with <b>on-board</b> <b>GPS</b> telemetry transmitting positional data in real time to a ground based computer and also back-up GPS data loggers for later analysis.|$|E
50|$|It {{is not a}} {{requirement}} that the station transmits its location, but of course this is advisable, and easy to do with <b>on-board</b> <b>GPS</b> location. UK amateurs have a system of regional secondary locators that they must use within UK territorial waters (e.g. adding D for Isle of Man, M for Scotland etc. in the second position in their callsign). In international waters, this is not necessary. When in the territorial waters of other countries, CEPT rules apply and these can get complex. The normal procedure is to prepend the national locator of the host country to the normal callsign, separated with another slash. So, amateur station A0AA, operating from a vessel within the territorial tidal waters of a country identified by the prefix B would identify itself as B/A0AA/MM when transmitting.|$|E

ORBCOMM {{is the only}} current satellite licensee operating in the 137-150 MHz VHF band, which was allocated globally for [...] "Little LEO" [...] systems. Several such systems were planned {{in the early to}} mid 1990s but ORBCOMM was the only one to successfully launch. In the continental United States, ORBCOMM statistically relays 90% of the text messages within six minutes, but gaps between satellites can result in message delivery times of 15 minutes or more. ORBCOMM reported during an earnings report call in early 2007 that 50% of subscriber-initiated reports (messages of six bytes in size) were received in less than 1 minute, 90% in less than 4 minutes and 98% in less than 15 minutes. With the current constellation of ORBCOMM satellites, there {{is likely to be a}} satellite within range of almost any spot on Earth at any time of the day or night.

5000|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a surge in large data sets {{available}} on human movements. These data sets are usually obtained from cell phone or GPS data, with varying degrees of accuracy. For example, cell phone data is usually recorded whenever a call or a text message has been made or received by the user, and contains the location of the tower that the phone has connected to as well as the time stamp. In urban areas, user and the telecommunication tower might be only a few hundred meters away from each other, while in rural areas this distance might well be in region of a few kilometers. Therefore, there is varying degree of accuracy when it comes to locating a person using cell phone data. These datasets are anonymized by the phone companies so as to hide and protect the identity of actual users. As example of its usage, researchers [...] used the trajectory of 100,000 cell phone users within a period of six months, while in much larger scale [...] trajectories of three million cell phone users were analyzed.GPS data are usually much more accurate even though they usually are, because of privacy concerns, much harder to acquire. Massive amounts of GPS data describing human mobility are produced, for example, by <b>on-board</b> <b>GPS</b> devices on private vehicles. The GPS device automatically turns on when the vehicle starts, and the sequence of GPS points the device produces every few seconds forms a detailed mobility trajectory of the vehicle. Some recent scientific studies compared the mobility patterns emerged from mobile phone data with those emerged from GPS data.|$|E

The <b>on-board</b> <b>GPS</b> receiver is a single frequency model supplied by China which, through the OBDH (On-Board Data Handling), downlinks the navigation solution (PVT) together with X-Band payload data. In order to verify the PVT accuracy of the <b>on-board</b> <b>GPS</b> receiver, two approaches were used: i) compare it with orbit determined by INPE´s control center; ii) compare it with orbit ephemeris generated by NASA two-line elements (TLE) freely available in Internet. The INPE´s Control Center (CCS) orbit determination using either ranging or Doppler tracking data agrees to each other to the tenth-s of meters. The NASA TLE ephemeris presents the worst agreement with either GPS or CCS. The CCS and GPS agree to the hundred-s meters level. Also it was investigated the possibility of determining the orbit using the GPS PVT data. For that, a simple orbit determination scheme was implemented to estimate the NASA two-lines elements (TLE) orbit representation. It is shown that, for the period analysed, such computed two-lines is as accurate as the Internet NASA two-lines elements, showing that GPS PVT data could eventually be used for operational orbit determination at the level of accuracy required for operation and tracking purposes of CBERS- 2 B.

40|$|Research {{towards an}} {{innovative}} {{solution to the}} problem of automated updating of road network databases is presented. It moves away from existing methods where vendors of road network databases either go through the time consuming and logistically challenging process of driving along roads to register changes or use update methods that rely on remote sensing images. For this approach we hypothesize that users of road network dependent applications (e. g. in-car navigation system or NavSat) could passively record drive trajectories with the <b>on-board</b> <b>GPS,</b> which would inform digital road network data providers if the user was on a road that departs from the known roads in the database. Then such drive characteristics would be collected using the <b>on-board</b> <b>GPS</b> on behalf of the provider. These data would be processed either by an on-board artificial neural network (ANN) or transferred back to the NavSat provider and input to an ANN along with similar track data provided by other service users, to decide whether or not to automatically update (add) the “unknown road” to the road database. As part of this work, in this paper we carry out an exploratory study on the trajectory information recorded with GPS. Trajectory data collected in London are analysed using a Snap-Drift Neural Network (SDNN) which categorises them into their strongest natural groupings, by combining clustering with feature detection in a single ANN. We investigate how the SDNN groups spatio-temporal variations associated with road traffic conditions. These variations are present in the recorded GPS trajectory data. For our approach which relies on users to passively record drive trajectory which are then processed as roads or not roads (Ekpenyong et al., 2007 a), it is important to investigate how these variations affects the recorded GPS which influences the grouping by the SDNN. For our approach a question like – how would SDNN groups GPS recorded on a road segment in the morning (supposedly heavy traffic) to that recorded in the day (less traffic) ?
