5|$|On July 31, the Tanana River {{began to}} {{overflow}} its banks in Nenana. Water flooded the rails <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Railroad in town, caused an evacuation of the town's clinic, and flooded low-lying areas throughout the town. By August 1, {{the entire town}} was at least partially flooded, with most basements and other low-lying areas being completely filled by floodwater. The flooding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Railroad track in town forced a halt to all passenger and freight operations between Anchorage and Fairbanks, effectively cutting off Fairbanks from rail traffic.|$|E
5|$|Born {{and raised}} in Springfield, Massachusetts, by French-Canadian {{immigrant}} parents, Gravel served in the U.S. Army in West Germany, and he later graduated from the Columbia University School of General Studies. He moved to Alaska in the late 1950s, becoming {{a real estate developer}} and entering politics. He served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1963 to 1966 and also became Speaker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> House. Gravel was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1968.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Railroad {{was completed}} in 1922, but by the 1930s, due to effects of the Great Depression, freight traffic declined on the railroad. In 1935, the Alaska Road Commission tried to force shippers to use the railroad, and raised the toll at the Tanana ferry crossing to almost 10 dollars a ton. The truckers rebelled at this, with some violent skirmishes. Pirate ferry operations were started, lasting until the start of World War II.|$|E
50|$|Herman Tilden Tripp (August 6, 1859 - July 5, 1939) was an Alaskan politician, {{including}} {{mayor of}} Juneau, Alaska from 1906 to 1907.

500|$|In addition, {{despite being}} {{much larger than}} the Baltimore class, <b>the</b> numbers <b>of</b> {{secondary}} and anti-aircraft batteries <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaskas</b> were similar. Whereas <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> class carried twelve 5"/38 caliber in six twin turrets, fifty-six 40mm, and thirty-four 20mm guns, the Baltimore class carried <b>the</b> same number <b>of</b> 5"/38s, eight fewer 40mm, and ten fewer 20mm., considerably fewer than new U.S. battleships that had ten (save for [...] ) 5"/38 twin mounts while older refitted U.S. battleships had eight. Author Richard Worth remarked that when they were finally completed, launched, and commissioned, they had <b>the</b> [...] "size <b>of</b> a battleship but <b>the</b> capabilities <b>of</b> a cruiser". <b>The</b> <b>Alaska</b> class was similarly expensive to build and maintain as contemporary battleships yet far less capable due to armor deficiencies, while able to put up an anti-aircraft defense comparable only to the much cheaper Baltimore cruisers.|$|R
5|$|About {{the time}} of the {{completion}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Railroad {{and the beginning of the}} dredging era in Fairbanks, Alaska's aviation industry began to take off. The first airplane flight in Alaska took place in Fairbanks on July 4, 1913, when a barnstormer flew from a field south of town. The aircraft had been crated and sent from Seattle via Skagway and Whitehorse. The pilot subsequently tried to sell the aircraft, but had no takers. Alaska's first commercial aircraft didn't arrive until June 1923, when Noel Wien began flying a Curtiss JN-4 on mail routes between Fairbanks and isolated communities. From Fairbanks, Wien became the first person to fly to Anchorage and cross the Arctic Circle in an airplane.|$|E
5|$|Alaska senator Ernest Gruening {{remained}} a staunch backer {{of the project}} from its inception to its cancellation, {{and made it a}} major personal political priority. Gruening led a coalition of Alaska lawmakers that included most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Legislature. In the 1962 Alaska state elections, every candidate elected to the state legislature was a supporter of the project. In the years that followed, the Alaska Legislature voted several times to allocate state funding for the project. Politicians at the city level also got into the action, as the city of Anchorage and the Fairbanks Public Utilities Board each voted to contribute $10,000 to a pro-Rampart organization. Among the group's members was Ted Stevens, who was appointed in 1968 as one of Alaska's representatives to the U.S. Senate.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of World War I, the easy-to-reach gold was {{exhausted}} and Fairbanks' population plunged as miners moved to promising finds at Ruby and Iditarod. Construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Railroad caused a surge of economic activity and allowed heavy equipment to be brought in for further exploitation of Fairbanks' gold deposits. Enormous gold dredges were built north of Fairbanks, and the city grew throughout the 1930s {{as the price of}} gold rose during the Great Depression. A further boom came during the 1940s and 1950s as the city became a staging area for construction of military depots during World War II and {{the first decade of the}} Cold War.|$|E

5|$|During summer 1942, more {{soldiers}} arrived in Fairbanks to replace those {{moved away from}} town. Fairbanks residents were drafted to work at Ladd Field because the U.S. Army believed Alaskans were best experienced in cold-weather work. After gold mining was suspended during the war, the Army leased FE Co. offices and requisitioned supplies from Fairbanks businesses. Wartime demand and the draft caused a severe labor shortage in Fairbanks, and supplies of various food and commercial products were interrupted beyond the wartime rationing {{in the rest of}} the country. Crime also increased, and because the U.S. Army was placed in wartime control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Territory, all newspapers and letters to and from Fairbanks were censored.|$|E
5|$|The 1941 census, {{the first}} to include Dawson Creek as a defined subdivision, counted 518 residents. Its growth spurred by the {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Highway, the town recorded a sevenfold increase to 3,589 residents in the 1951 census. Within five years, the population doubled to 7,531. New transport links with southern British Columbia and Alberta spurred continued growth into the next decade. The population peaked in 1966 at 12,392, then declined throughout the 1970s, rising again briefly during {{the construction of the}} nearby town of Tumbler Ridge in the early 1980s. Dawson Creek's population has remained relatively stable since then. Between 2005 and 2009, the population rose from 10,869 to 11,514, per provincial estimates.|$|E
5|$|The {{decline of}} Fairbanks' economy was {{partially}} {{offset by the}} construction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Railroad, {{and the arrival of}} President Warren G. Harding to dedicate the railroad in 1923. Harding visited the News-Miner offices and set a small bit of type for a special edition commemorating the visit. Less than one month later, however, Harding died on his return from Alaska. Harding's visit coincided with the first commercial airplane flight in the state of Alaska on July 19. By the next year, copies of the News-Miner were delivered regularly by aircraft to remote mining camps and roadhouses. In the process, the News-Miner became the first newspaper to regularly deliver via aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{secondary}} battery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> class {{was composed of}} twelve dual-purpose (anti-air and anti-ship) 5"/38 caliber guns in twin mounts, with four offset {{on each side of}} the superstructure (two on each beam) and two centerline turrets fore and aft. The 5"/38 was originally intended for use on only destroyers built in the 1930s, but by 1934 and into World War II it was being installed on almost all of the U.S.'s major warships, including aircraft carriers, battleships, and heavy and light cruisers.|$|E
5|$|In January 1941, a {{disagreement}} between Settlemier, {{one of his}} reporters, and the editor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Miner resulted in several changes to the News-Miner. Settlemier was replaced as editor by the reporter, David B. Tewkesbury, and the Alaska Miner was discontinued. Its editor, E.F. Jessen, created Jessen's Weekly, a separate newspaper, {{to compete with the}} News-Miner. The Weekly lasted until 1968, when it was closed by the Internal Revenue Service. The same year that Jessen founded his weekly newspaper, the United States became involved in the Second World War. Travel to and from Alaska was restricted, and after Japan invaded the Alaska islands of Attu and Kiska, the News-Miner was censored by the U.S. Army. Fairbanks benefited from a military construction boom as the United States built the Northwest Staging Route to ferry Lend-Lease aircraft to the Soviet Union. The boom left the News-Miner short-staffed, but it continued operations throughout the war.|$|E
5|$|The 1995 race {{featured}} 22 mushers, of whom 13 finished. Budget {{problems caused}} the first prize {{to drop by}} 25% to $15,000, contributing to the low participation. This problem was fixed for the 1996 race, with a first-place prize of $25,000. The 1997 race was won by Rick Mackey, brother of later Quest winner Lance Mackey; the two are the only brother-brother winning tandem in Quest history. Following the 1997 race, financial troubles again arose, this time on the Alaska side. Canadian organizers secured international sponsorship for the 1998 race, and when they refused to let this sponsorship money {{be used to pay}} debts accumulated in Alaska, members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> board threatened to host a separate competition. In the end, the Alaska board members were forced to resign, and a deal was worked out between the two sides.|$|E

500|$|The Japanese started {{designing}} the B64 class, which {{was similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> but with [...] guns. News <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaskas</b> led them to upgrade the design, creating Design B-65. Armed with 356mm guns, the B65s would have been <b>the</b> best armed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new breed <b>of</b> battlecruisers, but they still would have had only sufficient protection to keep out eight-inch shells. Much like the Dutch, the Japanese {{got as far as}} completing the design for the B65s, but never laid them down. By the time the designs were ready the Japanese Navy recognized that they had little use for the vessels and that their priority for construction should lie with aircraft carriers. Like <b>the</b> <b>Alaskas,</b> <b>the</b> Japanese did not call these ships battlecruisers, referring to them instead as super-heavy cruisers.|$|R

5|$|The {{injunction}} {{against the}} project forced Alyeska to do further research {{throughout the summer}} of 1970. The collected material {{was turned over to}} the Interior Department in October 1970, and a draft environmental impact statement was published in January 1971. The 294-page statement drew massive criticism, generating more than 12,000 pages of testimony and evidence in Congressional debates by the end of March. Criticisms of the project included its effect on the Alaska tundra, possible pollution, harm to animals, geographic features, and the lack of much engineering information from Alyeska. One element of opposition the report quelled was the discussion of alternatives. All the proposed alternatives—extension <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Railroad, an alternative route through Canada, establishing a port at Prudhoe Bay, and more—were deemed to pose more environmental risks than construction of a pipeline directly across Alaska.|$|E
5|$|The main {{advantage}} the HBC {{had over}} the Americans was that it could take such losses. As a vast corporation with {{a large amount of}} capital, the company was able to undersell the Americans, taking a loss, for years on end. By the middle to late 1830s the HBC policy on the coast was to pay whatever price necessary to ensure that furs fell into their hands and not the Americans. American traders soon found the coast fur trade unprofitable—the HBC had captured the trade. But Americans still traded with the Russians at Sitka and, once on the coast were wont to seek a few furs. As long as this continued, the HBC continued to have to pay high prices for furs and take losses. Eventually the Sitka trade became financially risky. The American-Russian agreement of 1824, which allowed Americans to trade in the Alaska Panhandle, expired in 1834 and was not renewed. In 1839 the HBC made an agreement with the Russian American Company (RAC), under which the HBC would supply the RAC with provisions and manufactures in exchange for a ten-year lease for portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Panhandle. This proved to be the final blow for the American traders, who were finally driven out of the North West Coast maritime fur trade altogether.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} {{of the population of the}} Pacific walrus spends its summers north of the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea of the Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of eastern Siberia, around Wrangel Island, in the Beaufort Sea along the north shore of Alaska south to Unimak Island, and in the waters between those locations. Smaller numbers of males summer in the Gulf of Anadyr on the southern coast of the Siberian Chukchi Peninsula, and in Bristol Bay off the southern coast of Alaska, west <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Alaska</b> Peninsula. In the spring and fall, walruses congregate throughout the Bering Strait, reaching from the western coast of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr. They winter over in the Bering Sea along the eastern coast of Siberia south to the northern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and along the southern coast of Alaska. A 28,000-year-old fossil walrus was dredged up from the bottom of San Francisco Bay, indicating Pacific walruses ranged that far south during the last ice age. There were roughly 200,000 Pacific walruses according to the most recent (1990) census-based estimate.|$|E
