500|$|In {{other common}} law jurisdictions, {{interpretation}} for similar situations is significantly different. In Canada, for example, four different interpretative doctrines {{are used in}} understanding taxation laws; [...] "strict construction, purposive interpretation, the plain meaning rule, and the words-in-total-context approach". In Stubart Investments Limited v The Queen, the Supreme Court of Canada decided to reject a strict approach and instead use the rule that [...] "the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, {{the object of the}} Act, and the intention of Parliament". Since then, however, both the purposive and plain meaning approaches have been used. Academics have rejected the idea that legislative history should be an aid to statutory interpretation, arguing, [...] "It would introduce intolerable uncertainty... if clear language in a detailed provision of [...] Act were to be qualified by unexpressed exceptions derived from a court's view of the <b>object</b> <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> ...|$|E

2500|$|As of 2016, the {{university}} was the world's largest English-French bilingual university. The university {{is one of the}} three bilingual universities in Ontario that is not federated with a larger university. Since its inception {{the university}} has seen itself as fostering English-French bilingualism. However, bilingualism was only made an official university policy in 1965 when the Government of Ontario passed An Act respecting Université d'Ottawa through the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. Section 4 of that Act specifically states that an <b>object</b> <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> of the university is"to further bilingualism and biculturalism and to preserve and develop French culture in Ontario", and [...] "to further ... Christian principles". [...] Despite that law, these parts of the university's mandate are now arguably superseded by the 1982 Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which constitutionalizes multiculturalism (not biculturalism) and freedom of religion.|$|E
2500|$|Glenn Perry {{asserts that}} because the French version {{resolves}} ambiguities in the English text, and is more consistent with the other clauses of the treaty, it is the correct interpretation. He argues that [...] "it is an accepted rule that the various language versions must be considered together, with the ambiguities of one version elucidated by the other". He cites Article 33 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which states that except when a treaty provides that one text shall prevail [...] "the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the <b>object</b> <b>and</b> <b>purpose</b> of the treaty, shall be adopted". He furthermore argues that {{the context of the}} passage, in a treaty that reaffirms [...] "'territorial integrity', 'territorial inviolability,' and 'the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war' - taken together cannot be reconciled with anything less than full withdrawal". He argues that the reference to [...] "secure and recognized borders" [...] can be interpreted in several ways, and only one of them contradicts the principle of full withdrawal.|$|E

40|$|The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) {{rules on}} the {{resolution}} of treaty conflicts are known as being despondently unhelpful. One identified lacuna is that these rules disregard many differences present in different kinds of treaties.

Respecting the intended <b>objects</b> <b>and</b> <b>purposes,</b> this paper presents three sub-characterizations, namely: universal character treaties; constitutional character treaties; and treaties with conflict resolution clauses.
