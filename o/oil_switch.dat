The research described in this thesis documents the efforts in developing repetitively pulsed, high-pressure <b>oil</b> <b>switch</b> technology. A high-pressure <b>oil</b> <b>switch</b> has been designed and optimized for lifetime operation to more than 10 ⁷ shots at the 250 J-level under repetitive pulsed conditions. The switch delivers pulses that are - 125 [kappa]V and 25 [kappa]A in amplitude, and 70 ns in duration, providing peak power up to 3. 25 GW into a matched impedance load. A pulsed modulator and pulse generating system has been developed to test the high-pressure <b>oil</b> <b>switch</b> to repetition rates of 22 pulses per second for sustained bursts at least 1, 000 shots long. Experiments were conducted under both single-shot and rep-rate conditions. The experiments identified both the mean breakdown voltage as well as the deviation of the breakdown voltages as functions of oil pressure and oil flow rate. The experiments found the breakdown voltage magnitude tracked the oil pressure. The experiments were inconclusive with respect to oil flow rate and breakdown performance. The experiments indicated that electrode erosion at 1, 000, 000 shots was relatively insignificant and thus all of the program goals (long life, high performance) have been met...|$|E

The research {{described in this}} thesis details the design, construction, and experimental results in developing a virtual cathode oscillator (vircator) high power microwave (HPM) source. The HPM source utilizes two independent vircators to create simultaneous microwave signals whose frequencies are variable from approximately 1 GHz to 3 GHz. The vircators are powered by a pulsed power modulator. The modulator consists of a thyratron-switched capacitor bank that pulse charges a water transmission line through a pulse transformer. An output pulse is created by a pressurized <b>oil</b> <b>switch</b> with an output risetime of 20 ns. The capacitor bank is charged to 30 kV by a bank of power supplies. A 1 : 10 pulse transformer charges the water line to 300 kV in approximately 2. 5 s. The output pulse from the water line is stepped up to 250 kV by an inductive adder. This signal is utilized to simultaneously drive the two, 32 Ω vircators in parallel with a 70 ns long pulse. Experimental results were collected for both the pulsed power system {{as well as the}} dual vircator HPM source. The vircators were characterized individually first to analyze the tunability of the sources. They were then connected in parallel to show frequency independence in order to create tunable multi-frequency HPM pulses...|$|E

The circuit breaker or switch {{is a piece}} of apparatus of prime importance in electrical engineering practice. Its value is evident at once on reflection that in the last analysis the control of electric power is primarily dependent on this part of the electrical system. The modern circuit breaker has taken the form of two or more separable contact immersed in an insulating fluid, usually oil. However, {{in the past few years}} the separation of contacts and the interruption of currents in vacuum has been successfully demonstrated and possesses distinct advantages. In connection with switching problems a difference between opening alternating current circuits and direct current circuits is encountered in that in the former case the current passes thru a zero value twice each cycle. Since the alternating case is the more important in modern practice (because alternating currents and voltages are employed on all large power and distribution systems) this case only will be discussed in this work. It would seem that the ideal method for electrical circuit interruption would be to separate the switch contacts very rapidly at the instant the current passes thru a zero value for at this time the energy stored in the magnetic fields linked with the circuit would be nil. If at this instant the voltage were also zero and if the contacts were opened with sufficient speed, an arcless switching operation would result. This is true only for the unity power factor case, however, and furthermore the contacts would have to be separated a reasonable distance in a time interval of the order of 0. 0001 second. The sensitive timing necessary for the realization of this ideal in a practical switch is as yet out of the question because of mechanical difficulties. In general the most severe duty imposed on a circuit breaker is that when it is called upon to interrupt short circuit currents. It is well known that one of the characteristics of these currents is their low lagging power factor. The condition is encountered that when the current is passing a zero value the voltage is near its maximum. If the current were interrupted at its zero value a high voltage would be impressed across the switch immediately and tend to strike an arc. If the contacts were separated at a time when the current value was not zero the voltage of induction would act to maintain the flow of current and an arc would necessarily result. Two examples will illustrate these points: Assume an inductive circuit draws a 50 -cycle current of 100 amperes at 0. 3 power factor lag from a 10, 000 volt source. If the contacts are opened at the time of zero current the voltage immediately impressed across the switch would be [ [...] . ] volts. Assume the contacts to be separated 0. 001 inch. The stress on the material interposed would be at least [ [...] . ] volts per inch. It is evident that such stress in the case of an oil circuit breaker would cause a break down the oil barrier and a formation of an arc. On the other hand if the contacts were opened at zero voltage a condition represented by the following calculation would result. From the above date – Inductance = 0. 303 henry. Assuming the electric strength of 0. 001 inch of oil to be 2500 volts, the permissible decay of the current would be 8200 amperes per second. For a condition of arcless switching the current should drop instantly to zero and this is of course inconsistent with the permissible decay of 8200 amperes per second. Many oscillograms of switching operation taken on various types of switches confirm the above and furthermore establish the fact that the arc once initiated continues until the current passes a zero value on some succeeding half cycle. It may be concluded that switching alternating currents is normally accompanied by an arc across the switch contacts with the possible exception of interrupting a unity power factor circuit when the current passes a zero value. In view of the fact that this phenomenon does enter into the switching problem it was considered pertinent to investigate the characteristics and especially to measure the voltages identified with it. The arc voltage is of considerable theoretical importance in the vacuum switch investigation and has never been accurately determined. It was also of interest to compare the arc characteristics of the <b>oil</b> <b>switch</b> with those of the vacuum switch and with those reported for oil switches by other investigators. This work has been undertaken with the purpose in mind of developing a method for accurate arc voltage measurement on a high voltage breaker and applying it to a vacuum switch and an <b>oil</b> <b>switch...</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{longitudinal}} cross-over feeding {{design was}} used to investigate the relationship of dietary lipid composition to the membrane lipid environment and activity of mitochondrial ATPase in vivo. Rats were fed a polyunsaturated fatty-acid-rich oil (soya-bean oil) for 12 days, crossed-over to a monounsaturated fatty-acid-rich oil (rapeseed oil) for the next 11 days, then returned to soya-bean oil for 11 more days. Additional rats were fed either soya-bean oil or rapeseed oil throughout. Rats fed rapeseed oil had lower rates of ATPase-catalysed ATP/[32 P]Pi exchange than rats fed soya-bean oil. Arrhenius plots showed higher transition temperature (Tt) and activation energy (Ea) for rats fed rapeseed <b>oil.</b> <b>Switching</b> from soya-bean <b>oil</b> to rapeseed oil was dynamically followed by changes in the thermotropic and kinetic properties of the mitochondrial ATPase exchange reaction. Returning to soya-bean oil reversed these changes. The rapid and reversible modulation of Tt caused by a change {{of the type of}} fat ingested suggests that membrane physicochemical properties are not under rigid intrinsic control but are continually modified by the profile of exogenously derived fatty acids. The studies suggest that in vivo the activity of mitochondrial ATPase is in part determined by dietary lipid via its influence on the microenvironment of the enzyme. The rapidity and ready reversibility of changes observed for this subcellular-membrane-bound enzyme suggest that dietary fatty-acid balance may be an important determinant of other membrane functions in the body...|$|R
