5|$|Charles {{continued}} {{the reform of}} coinage in the late 1330s. In 1336, he abolished the compulsory exchange of old coins for newly issued coins for villagers, but introduced a new tax, the chamber's profit, to compensate the loss of royal revenues. Two years later, Charles ordered the minting of a new silver penny and prohibited payments made in foreign coins <b>or</b> <b>silver</b> bars.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{is one of}} a few {{metallic}} elements with {{a natural}} color other than gray <b>or</b> <b>silver.</b> Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a reddish tarnish when exposed to air. The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light.|$|E
5|$|Ethiopian Airlines {{passengers}} are offered two lounges at Bole International Airport. Cloud Nine passengers can {{wait for the}} departure of flights at the Cloud Nine Lounge, where they are provided {{with a wide variety}} of amenities, as well as personal computers or wireless connection. Likewise, ShebaMiles cardholders with Gold <b>or</b> <b>Silver</b> status can make use of the Sheba Miles Lounge facilities. Customer Service agents are available at both lounges in order to assist passengers with any query regarding their flights.|$|E

5|$|Since its introduction, the Roosevelt dime {{has been}} struck {{continuously}} in large numbers. The Mint transitioned from striking the coin in silver to base metal in 1965, {{and the design}} remains essentially unaltered from when Sinnock created it. Without rare dates <b>or</b> <b>silver</b> content, the dime is less widely sought by coin collectors than other modern U.S. coins.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} bronze medals awarded {{was greater than}} either the gold <b>or</b> <b>silver.</b> This was due {{to a number of}} dead heats for third position, {{including}} the women's 100 meter hurdles and men's pole vault. Also, a second bronze medal was awarded for each of the boxing and judo events as there were no third/fourth position tiebreakers held.|$|E
5|$|The {{total number}} of bronze medals {{is greater than the}} {{total number of}} gold <b>or</b> <b>silver</b> medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in four sports: boxing, judo, karate and wrestling. In the women's 50m {{freestyle}} event of swimming, a tie for the second position between two swimmers from Italy meant that two silver medals (and no bronze) were awarded.|$|E

50|$|It {{is closely}} allied to, and {{isomorphous}} with, the corresponding sulfarsenide known as proustite <b>or</b> light red <b>silver</b> ore. Ruby <b>silver</b> <b>or</b> red <b>silver</b> ore (German Rotgiiltigerz) was mentioned by Georg Agricola in 1546, {{but the two}} species so closely resemble one another {{that they were not}} completely distinguished until chemical analyses of both were made.|$|R
5|$|Uranium is more {{plentiful}} than antimony, tin, cadmium, mercury, <b>or</b> <b>silver,</b> and it {{is about}} as abundant as arsenic or molybdenum. Uranium is found in hundreds of minerals, including uraninite (the most common uranium ore), carnotite, autunite, uranophane, torbernite, and coffinite. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as phosphate rock deposits, and minerals such as lignite, and monazite sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0.1% uranium).|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 609 medals (202 gold, 199 silver and 208 bronze) were awarded. The {{total number of}} bronze medals {{is greater than the}} total number of gold <b>or</b> <b>silver</b> medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in boxing (except men's light heavyweight and heavyweight categories). In +100kg {{category}} of freestyle wrestling, a tie for the first position in between the wrestlers of Iran and Japan meant that no silver medal was awarded. In gymnastics, a tie for second place in the parallel bars event resulted in two silver medals and thus no bronze was awarded, similarly a tie for first place in the uneven bars event meant that no silver medal was awarded.|$|E
5|$|At the {{national}} competition, Schools compete based on size and {{are divided into}} three divisions (I, II, and III). However, this separation is only limited to overall team score and overall individual score. Nine overall team medals are awarded: gold, silver and bronze for each division. Similarly, 27 overall individual medals are awarded: gold, silver and bronze for Honors, Scholastic, and Varsity in each division. The rest of the medals—for example, gold in art for Honors, <b>or</b> <b>silver</b> in math for Varsity—are awarded to the top scoring persons regardless of division. In addition, winning teams have often been invited to meet the President of the United States.|$|E
50|$|Tungsten's heat {{resistance}} makes it useful in arc welding applications {{when combined with}} another highly-conductive metal such as <b>silver</b> <b>or</b> copper. The <b>silver</b> <b>or</b> copper provides the necessary conductivity and the tungsten allows the welding rod to withstand the high-temperatures of the arc welding environment.|$|R

5|$|Bronze mirrors {{arrived to}} Japan from China {{as early as}} the Yayoi period and {{continued}} to be imported through the Tang Dynasty (618–907). During that period mirrors cast in Japan were imitations of Chinese prototypes and subsequently Japanese designs were established. All of these mirrors were generally circular, with a polished front, and a back decorated with molded or engraved reliefs, sometimes inlaid with gold <b>or</b> <b>silver.</b> Three mirrors or sets of mirrors decorated with floral and animal motifs have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} cheapness of manufacture of their basic components, many surviving examples of Late Roman helmets, including the Intercisa type, show evidence of expensive decoration {{in the form}} of silver or silver-gilt sheathing. A possible explanation {{is that most of the}} surviving exemplars may have belonged to officers and that silver- or gold-plating denoted rank; and, in the case of mounted gemstones, high rank e.g. the ornate Deurne helmet, believed by some historians to have belonged to a senior officer. Other academics, in contrast, consider that silver-sheathed helmets may have been widely worn by comitatenses soldiers, given as a form of pay or reward. Roman law indicates that all helmets of this construction were supposed to be sheathed in a specific amount of gold <b>or</b> <b>silver.</b>|$|E
5|$|Goldfish, {{domestication}} of: In ancient China, {{various species}} of carp (collectively known as Asian carps) were domesticated {{and have been}} reared as food fish for thousands of years. Some of these normally gray <b>or</b> <b>silver</b> species {{have a tendency to}} produce red, orange or yellow color mutations; this was first recorded in the Jin Dynasty (265–420). During the Tang Dynasty (618–907), it was popular to raise carp in ornamental ponds and watergardens. A natural genetic mutation produced gold (actually yellowish orange) rather than silver coloration. People began to breed the gold variety instead of the silver variety, keeping them in ponds or other bodies of water. Goldfish were introduced into Europe during the 17th century, and into North America in the 19th century.|$|E

50|$|Many tents {{are set up}} {{with fine}} kitchenware. Youll often find lots of lace and {{designer}} doilies, fine china, chandeliers, sterling <b>silver</b> <b>or</b> silver-plated candelabras and sterling <b>silver</b> <b>or</b> silver-plated utensils along with chandeliers in some tents. Much of the food is laid out on table cloths in sterling <b>silver</b> <b>or</b> silver-plated servers.|$|R
5|$|In Serbia, men {{believed}} to possess properties of an ala were called aloviti (ala-like) men, {{and they were}} given several explanations. An ala may have sneaked into them; these were recognized by their voracity, because the ala, {{in order to satisfy}} her excessive hunger, drove them to eat incessantly. They may also have survived an ala blowing on them– an ala’s breath is usually lethal to humans. These people would then become exceptionally strong. Alternatively, they could be the offspring of an ala and a woman, or could have been born covered with the caul. It was believed that aloviti men could not be killed with a gun or arrow, unless gold <b>or</b> <b>silver</b> was used.|$|E
5|$|In boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals {{are awarded}} in each weight class. Therefore, {{the total number}} of bronze medals is greater than {{the total number of}} gold <b>or</b> <b>silver</b> medals. An {{exception}} was the men's 84kg Greco-Roman wrestling, where Ara Abrahamian was stripped of his medal due to his conduct during the medal ceremony. Additionally there was a tie for the silver medal in the women's 100 metres in athletics and no bronze was awarded. Ties for third in swimming's men's 100 metre backstroke and men's 100 metre freestyle meant that two bronze medals were awarded for those events.|$|E
5|$|Martial's {{mention of}} gift-giving is {{repeated}} in the account by Dio, who says that Titus would throw wooden balls into the crowd from his seat in the box {{at the north end}} of the arena. These balls were inscribed with a description of a gift, either food, clothing, slaves, pack animals, horse, cattle, or gold <b>or</b> <b>silver</b> vessels. Anybody who caught one could hand over the ball to an official who would provide the named gift in return. This was not unusual: Suetonius mentions that Nero did the same, giving 1,000 birds daily, as well as food parcels, and vouchers for various extravagant gifts.|$|E
