In late 1929, Chaplin re-shot the first Flower Shop scene with Cherrill. This time, {{the scene was}} completed in six days and Chaplin was happy with Cherrill's performance. Chaplin had been shooting the film {{for a year and}} was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than half way finished. From March to April 1930, Chaplin shot the scenes inside of the millionaire's house at the Town House on Wilshire Boulevard. He hired Joe Van Meter and Albert Austin, whom he had known since his days working for Fred Karno, as the burglars. In the late spring of 1930, Chaplin shot the last major comedy sequence: the boxing match. Chaplin hired Keystone actor Hank Mann to play the Tramp's opponent. The scene required 100 extras and Chaplin took four days to rehearse and six to shoot the scene and was shot between June 23 and 30. Chaplin was initially nervous over the attendance for this scene so he invited his friends to be extras. Over 100 extras were present. Chaplin’s performance in the scene was so humorous that more people arrived daily to be an extra.|$|E
5|$|The {{battleship}} bombarded Iwo Jima from 19–22 February {{in support}} of the invasion there before escorting carriers which sent aircraft raids against Tokyo and targets on the island of Kyūshū. On 24 March and 19 April, Washington bombarded Okinawa; she then departed for Puget Sound to receive a refit, having been in action {{for the majority of the}} time since its refit in March–April 1944. This lasted through V-J Day and the subsequent formal ceremony aboard , so Washington received orders to voyage to Philadelphia, where she arrived on 17 October. Here she was modified to have an additional 145 bunks, so that she could participate in Operation Magic Carpet. Sailing to Southampton with a reduced crew of 84officers and 835crew, she brought 185army officers and 1,479enlisted men back to the United States; this was the only voyage she would make {{in support of}} the operation. The battleship was placed into reserve at Bayonne, New Jersey on 27 June 1947, after <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than six years of service. Washington was never reactivated. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1960—exactly 21 years to the day since its launch—she was sold on 24 May 1961 to be scrapped.|$|E

25|$|The Latvian {{language}} was not {{attractive to the}} Russian population of Latvia. In 1920–1930 <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than 15% of Russians could speak and write Latvian. The Latvian milieu of many towns was a good incentive for Russians to learn the Latvian language. 70% of Russian residents of Jelgava and more than 80% of those of Bauska, Valmiera and Kuldīga spoke Latvian.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, {{some smaller}} {{reserves}} were reorganised, and 83 Native Reserves of 21.6 million acres were recognised, which {{were for the}} exclusive use and occupation almost 900,000 Africans. Of this total, about 3 million acres were unsuitable for any agricultural use. A review {{after the end of}} BSAC administration in 1925 enforced stricter segregation of European and African land, while allowing <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> land for African use.|$|E

25|$|Apsley Cherry-Garrard in his {{analysis}} of the expedition estimated that even under optimistic assumptions the summit rations contained <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than half the calories actually required for the man-hauling of sledges. A carefully planned 2006 re-enactment of both Amundsen's and Scott's travels, sponsored by the BBC, confirmed Cherry-Garrard's theory. The British team had to abort their tour due to the severe weight loss of all members. The experts hinted that Scott's reports of unusually bad surfaces and weather conditions might in part have been due to their exhausted state which made them feel the sledge weights and the chill more severely.|$|E
25|$|ETFs are {{dependent}} on {{the efficacy of the}} arbitrage mechanism in order for their share price to track net asset value. While the average deviation between the daily closing price and the daily NAV of ETFs that track domestic indices is generally less than 2%, the deviations may be more significant for ETFs that track certain foreign indices. The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2008, during a period of market turbulence, that some lightly traded ETFs frequently had deviations of 5% or more, exceeding 10% in a handful of cases, although even for these niche ETFs, the average deviation was <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than 1%. The trades with the greatest deviations tended to be made immediately after the market opened.|$|E
25|$|F-5s {{were bought}} by aerial survey {{companies}} and employed for mapping. From the 1950s on, {{the use of}} the Lightning steadily declined, and <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than two dozen still exist, with few still flying. One example is a P-38L owned by the Lone Star Flight Museum in Galveston, Texas, painted in the colors of Charles H. MacDonald's Putt Putt Maru. Two other examples are F-5Gs which were owned and operated by Kargl Aerial Surveys in 1946, and are now located in Chino, California at Yanks Air Museum, and in McMinnville, Oregon at Evergreen Aviation Museum. The earliest-built surviving P-38, Glacier Girl, was recovered from the Greenland ice cap in 1992, fifty years after she crashed there on a ferry flight to the UK, and after a complete restoration, flew once again ten years after her recovery.|$|E

25|$|His army's {{numbers were}} also low, only about 1,500 men at first, with two third on cavalry, and <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than 600 had firearms. Bayonets were in short supply, {{so they had}} to improvise by adding lances to their arsenal. Those {{officers}} that could not bring their own saber would have to do without. The scarcity of arms and supplies forced them to impose a strict control and organization. Belgrano spent the first months of his command in establishing a hospital, military tribunal, supply corps, reconnaissance company and in negotiating the manufacturing of ammunition and clothing. The relative hostility of the local population over the demands of the porteños did not make his job easy. He utilized the few friendships with the locals, La Madrid among them, to help with troop recruiting. Crucial in this task was Güemes, who with his troubled personal relations with Belgrano would force the latter to release him in June before even having had a chance to do combat.|$|E
500|$|Everett {{opposed the}} 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed the territories to choose whether to allow slavery by popular vote, {{calling it a}} [...] "horrible" [...] and [...] "detested" [...] bill. [...] However, because of his health he missed a {{critical}} vote on the bill, departing the chamber during a debate that ended up lasting all night. [...] This angered Massachusetts anti-slavery interests, who sent him a strongly-worded petition {{to submit to the}} Senate. [...] Because of his distaste for the more extreme elements in the abolition debate, Everett's speech in support of the petition was weak, for which he was further criticized. [...] The rancor of the situation greatly upset Everett, and he submitted his resignation letter on May 12, 1854, after <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than one year into his six-year term, once again citing poor health.|$|E

Hazlitt, never reticent about criticising kings or government ministers, soon became a target. <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than a week had passed when the Quarterly Review [...] "delivered a diabolical notice of Characters of Shakespeare's Plays—possibly by its editor, William Gifford."

500|$|Altogether, Ripken spent 36 {{years in}} the Baltimore Orioles organization, serving as a player, a scout, a coach, and a manager. He is remembered for helping bring about [...] "The Oriole Way", Baltimore's {{tradition}} of excellence. The Baltimore Sun wrote, [...] "Most Baltimore fans couldn't define the term exactly, but they liked that it implied reverence for the sport and {{the skills needed to}} play it well." [...] Elrod Hendricks, another longtime Oriole coach who kept in touch with Ripken throughout the years, said [...] "He was baseball and baseball was him." [...] Sam Perlozzo, who like Ripken spent many years as a third base coach, said [...] "When you were around him, you didn't say much. One reason was out of respect. The other was because you could learn from him, no matter how long you had been in the game." [...] Despite his 36 years with the organization, <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> than one of them were as manager of the team, causing Thomas Boswell to write, [...] "The idea that a person could find deep satisfaction through fulfilling difficult responsibilities – while never focusing on personal rewards – seems antique these days.

"Eiseley {{took the}} {{occasion}} of the lunar landing to consider how far humans had to go in understanding their own small corner of the universe, their home planet, much less what he called the 'cosmic prison' of space. Likening humans to the microscopic phagocytes that dwell within our bodies, he grumpily remarks, 'We know <b>only</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>more</b> extended reality than the hypothetical creature below us. Above us may lie realms it is beyond our power to grasp.' Science, he suggests, would be better put to examining that which lies immediately before us, although he allows that the quest to explore space is so firmly rooted in Western technological culture that it was unlikely to be abandoned simply because of his urging. Eiseley's opinion continues to be influential among certain environmentalists, and these graceful essays show why that should be so.|$|E
