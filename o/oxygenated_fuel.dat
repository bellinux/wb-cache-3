40|$|Owing to the {{increasing}} share of biofuels in combustion engines, use of these <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> instead of diesel should be evaluated under different engine operating conditions. This paper studies the influence of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> on engine performance parameters under transient, compared to steady-state, operation on a six-cylinder, turbocharged, compression-ignition engine with a common rail injection system. The fuels {{used in this study}} were diesel, waste cooking biodiesel, and triacetin (as a highly oxygenated additive). A custom test was used to investigate different engine performance parameters during acceleration, load increase, and steady-state modes of operation. Additionally, a legislative transient cycle (NRTC), composed of many discrete transient modes, was used to study engine performance during a whole transient cycle. In this paper, different engine performance-related parameters were investigated, such as IMEP, BMEP, FMEP, turbocharger lag, air-to-fuel ratio, engine speed and torque, start of injection, start of combustion, injection pressure, maximum in-cylinder pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise, intake and exhaust manifold pressures, and CoV of IMEP. The investigation demonstrates that engine behavior during transient operation is different from steady-state operation. Results during NRTC indicated that, in comparison with diesel, the <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> have lower IMEP (up to 18. 7 %), BMEP (up to 21. 7 %), and FMEP (up to 12. 7 %).

By using a custom test designed for this study, a comparative investigation was performed on exhaust emissions during cold- and hot-start with diesel and three <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> based on waste cooking biodiesel and triacetin. This study used a six-cylinder, turbocharged, after-cooled diesel engine with a common rail injection system. The results during cold-start with diesel showed lower NOx (up to 15. 4 %), PN (up to 48 %), PM 1 (up to 44 %) and PM 2. 5 (up to 63 %).

Interesting candidates from <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> in this respect include both n-butanol and 2, 5 -dimethylfuran (DMF), because they have already been used in diesel engines recently. However, information is rather limited on n-butanol and DMF added into a diesel fuel surrogate in fundamental flames to investigate the mechanism of soot reduction. In the current work, both n-butanol and DMF was successively added into diesel surrogate (80 % n-heptane and 20 % toluene in volume, named as T 20) in co-flow partially premixed flames. The effects of different oxygenated structures on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and soot were investigated at the same oxygen weight fractions of 4 % and the same volume fractions of 20 %. The diagnostics on PAHs, soot volume fractions and soot sizes were conducted by using both laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and two-color laser-induced incandescence (2 C-LII). A combined detailed kinetic model (n-heptane/toluene/butanols/DMF/PAHs) has been obtained in order to clarify the chemical effects of the different <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> on PAHs formation. Results show that the reduced toluene content due to the addition of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> is the dominant factor for the reduction of soot, {{as compared with the}} base fuel of T 20. The oxygenated structure of n-butanol has a higher ability to reduce PAHs and soot as compared with the addition of DMF.

However, the formation of PAHs can be inhibited remarkably as blending n-butanol because only small hydrocarbons like C 2 H 2 and C 3 H 3 etc. are formed. The formation rate of A 4 is more similar to that of soot in comparison with the smaller ring aromatics.

40|$|This {{project is}} a {{combination}} of process simulation and catalyst development aimed at identifying the most economical method for converting coal to syngas to linear higher alcohols to be used as <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuel</b> additives. There are two tasks. The goal of Task 1 is to discover, study, and evaluate novel heterogeneous catalytic systems for the production of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuel</b> enhancers from synthesis gas, and to explore, analytically and on the bench scale, novel reactor and process concepts for use in converting syngas to liquid fuel products. The goal of Task 2 is to simulate, by computer, energy efficient and economically efficient processes for converting coal to energy (fuel alcohols and/or power). The primary focus is to convert syngas to fuel alcohols. This report contains results from Task 2. The first step for Task 2 was to develop computer simulations of alternative coal to syngas to linear higher alcohol processes, to evaluate and compare the economics and energy efficiency of these alternative processes, and to make a preliminary determination as to the most attractive process configuration. A benefit of this approach is that simulations will be debugged and available for use when Task 1 results are available. Seven cases were developed using different gasifier technologies, different methods for altering the H{sub 2 }/CO ratio of the syngas to the desired 1. 1 / 1, and with the higher alcohol fuel additives as primary products and as by-products of a power generation facility. Texaco, Shell, and Lurgi gasifier designs were used to test gasifying coal. Steam reforming of natural gas, sour gas shift conversion, or pressure swing adsorption were used to alter the H{sub 2 }/CO ratio of the syngas. In addition, a case using only natural gas was prepared to compare coal and natural gas as a source of syngas...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this memo is to {{document}} the effects of changing gasoline specifications on exhaust emissions from nonroad gasoline-fueled engines that are incorporated in EPAâ€™s NONROAD emissions inventory model. There {{have been a number}} of gasoline specifications that have changed or have been considered for change in the past few years. The most prominent of these changes has been summer volatility restrictions, wintertime <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuel</b> requirements, and reformulated gasoline requirements which incorporate year-round oxygenate requirements and summertime emission requirements. For reasons described below, the effect of these fuel changes on nonroad gasoline engines â€™ exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOC) is ascribed mainly to the oxygen content. Any expected changes to the fuel sulfur is expected to reduce SOx emissions only...|$|E
40|$|The {{combustion}} {{and emissions}} performance of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> {{has been investigated}} in a modern direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engine. In particular, the new biofuel candidate, 2, 5 -dimethylfuran, otherwise known as DMF, has been assessed as a future automotive fuel against ethanol, the most commercially accepted spark-ignition (SI) biofuel. When operating with DMF, the engine performance and emissions are less sensitive to changes in key control parameters than with gasoline. This allows a wider window for improving performance and/or reducing emissions. The relevance of modern injection strategies to increase performance or efficiency has also been assessed when using DMF. The use of split-injection at full load is shown to be less beneficial than with gasoline. Novel fuel preparation techniques have been investigated by comparing externally supplied gasoline-biofuel blends (conventional method) to internally mixed, dual-injection blends. This new mode presents an avenue for optimising <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> with a low heat of vaporization, such as DMF and n-butanol; low blends with gasoline (â‰¤ 25...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the present endeavor is to collect, consolidate, and review the vast amount of experimental data on the laminar flame speeds of hydrocarbon and <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> that {{have been reported in}} recent years, analyze them by using a detailed kinetic mechanism for the pyrolysis and combustion of a large variety of fuels at high temperature conditions, and thereby identify aspects of the mechanism that require further revision. The review and assessment was hierarchically conducted, in the sequence of the foundational C 0 eC 4 species; the reference fuels of alkanes (n-heptane, iso-octane, ndecane, n-dodecane), cyclo-alkanes (cyclohexane and methyl-cyclo-hexane) and the aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene); and the <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> of alcohols, C 3 H 6 O isomers, ethers (dimethyl ether and ethyl tertiary butyl ether), and methyl esters up to ethyl decanoate. Mixtures of some of these fuels, including those with hydrogen, were also considered. The comprehensive nature of the present mechanism and effort is emphasized...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} chemical {{kinetic model}} is developed and {{tested for the}} combustion of C 2 and C 3 <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> such as ethanol, DME (dimethyl ether), acetone and n-propanol. It is validated by comparing predictions with experimental data {{on the structure of}} low pressure burner stabilised premixed flames and laminar burning velocities over a wide range of equivalence ratios. Data from shock tube and stirred reactor studies has also been considered. The elementary reactions of ethanol and DME oxidation have been studied extensively and were used {{as a starting point for}} extension to C 3 <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels.</b> The chemistry of acetylene which is one of major intermediate species in higher hydrocarbon flames was also updated to improve the reliability of the present mechanism and acetylene laminar burning velocities and low-pressure premixed lean and rich flames were also computed. The detailed mechanism features more than 1500 reaction steps and 269 species. The structure of laminar premixed flames are predicted by using measured temperature profiles and conditions cover fuel-lean and fuel-rich mixtures at low pressure. The profiles of reactants, products and major intermediate species are compared to experimental data from mass spectrometry and the overall agreement between the kinetic model and experimental data is satisfactory. An analytic study of fuel consumption pathways is carried out to understand the detailed consumption pathways. The present mechanism is also tested against laminar flame speeds by calculating freely propagating premixed flames to extend the understanding of the combustion characteristics of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels.</b> A sensitivity analysis is also performed.
