The fuels {{used in this study}} were diesel, waste cooking biodiesel, and triacetin (as a highly oxygenated additive). A custom test was used to investigate different engine performance parameters during acceleration, load increase, and steady-state modes of operation. Additionally, a legislative transient cycle (NRTC), composed of many discrete transient modes, was used to study engine performance during a whole transient cycle. In this paper, different engine performance-related parameters were investigated, such as IMEP, BMEP, FMEP, turbocharger lag, air-to-fuel ratio, engine speed and torque, start of injection, start of combustion, injection pressure, maximum in-cylinder pressure, maximum rate of pressure rise, intake and exhaust manifold pressures, and CoV of IMEP. The investigation demonstrates that engine behavior during transient operation is different from steady-state operation.

By using a custom test designed for this study, a comparative investigation was performed on exhaust emissions during cold- and hot-start with diesel and three <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> based on waste cooking biodiesel and triacetin. This study used a six-cylinder, turbocharged, after-cooled diesel engine with a common rail injection system.

Interesting candidates from <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> in this respect include both n-butanol and 2, 5 -dimethylfuran (DMF), because they have already been used in diesel engines recently. However, information is rather limited on n-butanol and DMF added into a diesel fuel surrogate in fundamental flames to investigate the mechanism of soot reduction. In the current work, both n-butanol and DMF was successively added into diesel surrogate (80 % n-heptane and 20 % toluene in volume, named as T 20) in co-flow partially premixed flames. The effects of different oxygenated structures on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and soot were investigated at the same oxygen weight fractions of 4 % and the same volume fractions of 20 %. The diagnostics on PAHs, soot volume fractions and soot sizes were conducted by using both laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and two-color laser-induced incandescence (2 C-LII). A combined detailed kinetic model (n-heptane/toluene/butanols/DMF/PAHs) has been obtained in order to clarify the chemical effects of the different <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> on PAHs formation. Results show that the reduced toluene content due to the addition of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> is the dominant factor for the reduction of soot, {{as compared with the}} base fuel of T 20. The oxygenated structure of n-butanol has a higher ability to reduce PAHs and soot as compared with the addition of DMF. This {{is due to the fact}} that the consumption of DMF leads to much formation of C 5 H 5 which enhances the formation of PAHs and subsequent soot. However, the formation of PAHs can be inhibited remarkably as blending n-butanol because only small hydrocarbons like C 2 H 2 and C 3 H 3 etc. are formed. The formation rate of A 4 is more similar to that of soot in comparison with the smaller ring aromatics.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this memo is to {{document}} the effects of changing gasoline specifications on exhaust emissions from nonroad gasoline-fueled engines that are incorporated in EPA’s NONROAD emissions inventory model. There {{have been a number}} of gasoline specifications that have changed or have been considered for change in the past few years. The most prominent of these changes has been summer volatility restrictions, wintertime <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuel</b> requirements, and reformulated gasoline requirements which incorporate year-round oxygenate requirements and summertime emission requirements. For reasons described below, the effect of these fuel changes on nonroad gasoline engines ’ exhaust emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOC) is ascribed mainly to the oxygen content. Any expected changes to the fuel sulfur is expected to reduce SOx emissions only...|$|E
40|$|The {{combustion}} {{and emissions}} performance of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> {{has been investigated}} in a modern direct-injection spark-ignition (DISI) engine. In particular, the new biofuel candidate, 2, 5 -dimethylfuran, otherwise known as DMF, has been assessed as a future automotive fuel against ethanol, the most commercially accepted spark-ignition (SI) biofuel. When operating with DMF, the engine performance and emissions are less sensitive to changes in key control parameters than with gasoline. This allows a wider window for improving performance and/or reducing emissions. The relevance of modern injection strategies to increase performance or efficiency has also been assessed when using DMF. The use of split-injection at full load is shown to be less beneficial than with gasoline. Novel fuel preparation techniques have been investigated by comparing externally supplied gasoline-biofuel blends (conventional method) to internally mixed, dual-injection blends. This new mode presents an avenue for optimising <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> with a low heat of vaporization, such as DMF and n-butanol; low blends with gasoline (≤ 25...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the present endeavor is to collect, consolidate, and review the vast amount of experimental data on the laminar flame speeds of hydrocarbon and <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> that {{have been reported in}} recent years, analyze them by using a detailed kinetic mechanism for the pyrolysis and combustion of a large variety of fuels at high temperature conditions, and thereby identify aspects of the mechanism that require further revision. The review and assessment was hierarchically conducted, in the sequence of the foundational C 0 eC 4 species; the reference fuels of alkanes (n-heptane, iso-octane, ndecane, n-dodecane), cyclo-alkanes (cyclohexane and methyl-cyclo-hexane) and the aromatics (benzene, toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene); and the <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> of alcohols, C 3 H 6 O isomers, ethers (dimethyl ether and ethyl tertiary butyl ether), and methyl esters up to ethyl decanoate. Mixtures of some of these fuels, including those with hydrogen, were also considered. The comprehensive nature of the present mechanism and effort is emphasized...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} chemical {{kinetic model}} is developed and {{tested for the}} combustion of C 2 and C 3 <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels</b> such as ethanol, DME (dimethyl ether), acetone and n-propanol. It is validated by comparing predictions with experimental data {{on the structure of}} low pressure burner stabilised premixed flames and laminar burning velocities over a wide range of equivalence ratios. Data from shock tube and stirred reactor studies has also been considered. The elementary reactions of ethanol and DME oxidation have been studied extensively and were used {{as a starting point for}} extension to C 3 <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels.</b> The chemistry of acetylene which is one of major intermediate species in higher hydrocarbon flames was also updated to improve the reliability of the present mechanism and acetylene laminar burning velocities and low-pressure premixed lean and rich flames were also computed. The detailed mechanism features more than 1500 reaction steps and 269 species. The structure of laminar premixed flames are predicted by using measured temperature profiles and conditions cover fuel-lean and fuel-rich mixtures at low pressure. The profiles of reactants, products and major intermediate species are compared to experimental data from mass spectrometry and the overall agreement between the kinetic model and experimental data is satisfactory. An analytic study of fuel consumption pathways is carried out to understand the detailed consumption pathways. The present mechanism is also tested against laminar flame speeds by calculating freely propagating premixed flames to extend the understanding of the combustion characteristics of <b>oxygenated</b> <b>fuels.</b> A sensitivity analysis is also performed.
