5|$|The Celtics {{were unable}} to repeat their title in 1987 despite several {{dramatic}} playoff victories. Johnson played strong defense again, earning yet another appearance on the All-Defensive First Team, and the Celtics embarked on a nail-biting playoff campaign. In the 1987 Eastern Conference Semifinals, the Celtics split the first six games against the Milwaukee Bucks. In the deciding Game 7, which the Celtics won, Johnson had a spectacular play with 1:30 left in the game: a Celtics ball threatened to fly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds,</b> but Johnson dived for it and whipped it backwards in mid-air against Bucks center and former Sonics teammate Jack Sikma. The ball bounced off Sikma before going <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds,</b> and the Celtics maintained possession.|$|E

5|$|The Eagles' post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 33-yard line, and on the first play after the kick, Boston College committed a personal foul penalty when Tyrod Taylor was hit <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds.</b> Following the penalty, the ball was advanced to the Tech 42-yard line and the Hokies were given a first down. Tech completed two short passes, advancing to the 50-yard line, but the Hokies punted after not gaining another first down. The kick sailed <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds,</b> and the Eagles returned to offense with 19 seconds remaining in the first half. Rather than try to score quickly, Boston College elected to run out the clock with Virginia Tech leading, 14–7.|$|E
5|$|Because Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Boston College {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's kickoff was returned to the Eagles' 35-yard line, and Boston College's offense began the first possession of the second half. An incomplete pass by Davis {{was followed by a}} short rush and another incomplete pass, and the Eagles were forced to punt after going three and out. The kick went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> at Virginia Tech's 32-yard line, and the Hokies' offense had their first possession of the second half. Tech likewise went three and out, then returned the ball to the Eagles with a punt. The kick went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds,</b> and following the exchange, Boston College's offense started from its 31-yard line.|$|E

5|$|Texas {{returned}} the kick to its 32-yard line, {{and on the}} first play from scrimmage, Tech sacked Brown for a loss of nine yards. Williams regained five of the lost yards, but on third down Brown threw an incomplete pass. Texas' punt bounced <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> at the 33-yard line, and Virginia Tech's offense returned to the field with 5:30 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies {{were forced}} to punt again, and Brent Bowden's 50-yard punt stuck the Eagles deep in their own territory. The drive began with a five-yard penalty against Boston College and culminated two plays later in a six-yard loss on a sack of Matt Ryan by Hokie defender Barry Booker. Boston College punted, but the kick by Johnny Ayers {{traveled}} just 34yards before sailing <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the score, Tech was penalized 15 {{yards for}} {{excessive}} celebration, allowing Texas {{a better chance}} to return the post-score kickoff. Texas' kick returner fumbled the return, however and the ball rolled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> at the Texas 10-yard line. On the first play after the kickoff, Brown was sacked at the Texas two-yard line. Williams regained some of the lost yardage with a five-yard run, but on third down he was stopped after another five-yard gain. Rather than attempt to convert the fourth down, Texas punted with 2:33 remaining in the game.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop an}} {{approach}} to apply formal methods to represent the program source codes as a model, after that, using automated theorem prover to try to detect runtime violations in those codes by doing static analysis. Unlike other proof based program verification approaches, this approach is based on hypothesis to develop the formal specification information implied by source codes, such as invariants, preconditions, postconditions and other runtime assertions, then using automated theorem prover to verify the correctness of each statement in the program. Our research work is an extension to compilers, can catch those runtime exceptions which are <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bound</b> <b>of</b> the capability of compiler’s control-flow based analysis...|$|R
5|$|Because Nebraska {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Following the kickoff and return, Virginia Tech began at its 19-yard line. On the first play of the second half, Oxendine broke loose for a 36-yard run to the Nebraska 45-yard line and a first down. Despite that strong opening play, Tech was unable to gain another first down {{and was forced to}} punt after gaining only two additional yards. The Tech punt rolled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> at the Nebraska 26-yard line.|$|E
5|$|Box {{lacrosse}} is {{a modern}} version of the game that was invented in Canada during the 1920s and 1930s. The roots of indoor lacrosse are obscure, but its invention {{has been attributed to}} one Paddy Brennan, a field lacrosse player and referee from Montreal, who, being annoyed by the constant slowing of play from balls going <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> in the field game, experimented with indoor games at the Mount Royal Arena during the early 1920s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the team}} finals, Liukin {{performed}} on three events: beam, bars and floor exercise. Her uneven bars score of 16.900 {{was the highest}} mark awarded in the entire Olympic competition. Liukin performed second on balance beam, matching her qualifying score of 15.975. On floor exercise, she stepped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> on her first tumbling pass, incurring a 0.1-point penalty, with a final score of 15.200.

5|$|On {{the ensuing}} Tech possession, Tech's quarterback {{continued}} to play poorly. On the third play following the kickoff, Glennon was intercepted {{for the fourth time}} in the game. The downfield interception set up Georgia at their own 11-yard line. Georgia rushed the ball three times, forcing Virginia Tech to use twotimeouts in order to stop the clock. The punt by Georgia's Ely-Kelso was poorly done, and traveled only 15yards before going <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Gators later {{drove to}} the 4-yard line before they were held on downs. After Dodd's punt to midfield, the Gators' {{engineered}} their final scoring drive. A 27-yard pass from Brumbaugh to Van Sickel got the Gators <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> at the 1-yard line. Crabtree ran it in for the touchdown, but Brumbaugh's place kick for the extra point was wide and short. Some sources, such as Peter Golenbock's Go Gators!, claim it was blocked.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{outcome was}} in doubt {{until the final}} minute of play. With 19seconds left on the game clock, Vince Young ran for a {{touchdown}} and regained the lead for the Longhorns. He followed up by running {{the ball into the}} end zone for a two-point conversion. Leinart had time to attempt one pass but his pass fell <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> as time expired; UT beat USC by the score of 41–38.|$|E

The interception was the final play of the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech in the lead, 3413.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was {{returned}} to the 21-yard line, and Alabama again attempted to answer the Hokie score. After an incomplete pass, Zow completed a 21-yard pass to Jackson for a first down at the 42-yard line. Alexander was stopped for a one-yard loss on a running play, then caught a pass for no gain. On third down, Zow threw an incomplete pass, forcing another punt. The kick rolled <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds</b> at the Tech 17-yard line, and the Hokies' offense began another drive.|$|E
5|$|Air Force's post-score kickoff went <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>bounds,</b> {{resulting}} in a penalty that allowed Tech to automatically start its second offensive possession of the game at its 35-yard line. On his first play, Randall completed a 19-yard pass that drove the Hokie offense into Air Force territory {{for the first time}} and gained Tech another first down. Two plays later, Randall completed another pass, this time a 16-yard toss that pushed Tech to the Air Force 30-yard line. Though the Hokies gained several more yards on short plays, they were unable to earn another first down. Tech kicker Carter Warley was sent into the game to attempt a 41-yard field goal, but the kick bounced off the right upright and Tech was denied three points. With 4:59 remaining in the first quarter, Air Force still held a 10–0 lead.|$|E
