5|$|Although {{the concern}} for a thiomersal-autism link was {{originally}} derived from indirect evidence based on the known potent neurotoxic effects of methylmercury, recent studies show these feared effects were likely <b>overestimated.</b> Ethylmercury, such as in thiomersal, clears much faster from the body after administration than methylmercury, suggesting total mercury exposure over time is much less with ethylmercury. Currently used methods of estimating brain deposition of mercury likely overestimates the amounts deposited due to ethylmercury, and ethylmercury also decomposes quicker in the brain than methylmercury, suggesting a lower risk of brain damage. These findings show that the assumptions that originally led to concern about the toxicity of ethylmercury, which were based on direct comparison to methylmercury, were flawed.|$|E

The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the Army of the Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington.

Crass influenced the anarchist movement in the UK, the US and beyond. The growth of anarcho-punk spurred interest in anarchist ideas. The band have also claimed credit for revitalising the peace movement and the UK Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Others contend that they <b>overestimated</b> their influence, their radicalising effect on militants notwithstanding. Crass' philosophical and aesthetic influences on 1980s punk bands were far-reaching, although few mimicked their later free-form style (heard on Yes Sir, I Will and their final recording, Ten Notes on a Summer's Day). Their painted and collage black-and-white record sleeves (by Gee Vaucher) may have influenced later artists such as Banksy (with whom Vaucher collaborated) and the subvertising movement.

40|$|Previous {{research}} on building pre-tender cost estimating {{stresses the importance}} of giving accurate estimates and minimizing estimating errors. Cost models, especially those mathematical models using mean square error or the like for model training and validation, often treat positive errors (<b>overestimates)</b> and negative errors (underestimates) of equal magnitude the same with an implicit assumption that the regret or disutility of positive errors (<b>overestimates)</b> is equal to that of negative errors (underestimates). A survey was conducted in Hong Kong to study estimating practice and in particular, the attitude of clients and estimators towards estimating errors. This involved the use of regression analysis to model the relative disutility of underestimates (in terms of <b>overestimates)</b> for four different building types. Both clients and estimators are found to be risk averse—tolerating <b>overestimates</b> more than underestimates—and, arguably, clients are satisfied with <b>overestimates.</b> However, they have contrasting views on the desired characteristics of estimates with clients considering the ability to identify cost sensitive elements to be more important than accuracy.
