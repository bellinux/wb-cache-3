5|$|One {{of three}} {{libraries}} for Oregon State, The Valley Library stores more than 1.4 million volumes, 14,000 serials, {{and more than}} 500,000 maps and government documents. It is designated as a Federal Depository Library and is also a repository for state documents. The six-story library building is of a contemporary, neoclassical style with a red-brick exterior highlighted by white sections along the top and on part of the eastern side. The eastern side includes a white-faced rotunda that features a two-story atrium <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|Atticus {{does not}} want Jem and Scout to be present at Tom Robinson's trial. No seat is {{available}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor,</b> so by invitation of the Rev. Sykes, Jem, Scout, and Dill watch from the colored balcony. Atticus establishes that the accusers—Mayella and her father, Bob Ewell, the town drunk—are lying. It also becomes clear that the friendless Mayella made sexual advances toward Tom, and that her father caught her and beat her. Despite significant evidence of Tom's innocence, the jury convicts him. Jem's faith in justice becomes badly shaken, as is Atticus', when the hapless Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.|$|E

5|$|The librarians {{sought a}} larger and more centrally-located space than the Briarcliff Farms building. On March 18, 1930, after {{invitation}} from the Briarcliff school district's Board of Education, the library was relocated again. It moved to a large room <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor</b> of Briarcliff High School's extension to its Law Park school building. In August 1949, the school required more classroom space, so the Board of Education asked the library to relocate. The village board then provided the library with two rooms {{on the second floor}} of its recreation building near the village downtown on Old Route 100 (then part of NY Route 100). From the beginning, the recreation center rooms were too small to hold the library's collection (only holding about 7,000 of its 8,500 books), had insufficient room for tables and chairs, and no space for exhibits or displays. As well, the area was busy with traffic, due to its location at the intersection of two highways. It was also far from the village's public school buildings and had no sidewalks nearby, making it poorly-accessible and hazardous for children to visit.|$|E

50|$|Many {{shops in}} the {{building}} are import/export businesses dealing in parallel goods that are predominantly sold to Asian and African countries. <b>On</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floors</b> {{as well as on}} upper floors in the towers, there are many restaurants that attract visitors from all over the world. For example, some small and family-run Indian and Pakistani restaurants with traditional Indian curry and Nepalese food are very well known. Due to competition between the very large number of restaurants inside the Mansions that are similar in style, many of them send staff to distribute leaflets <b>on</b> <b>the</b> streets to aggressively promote their restaurants.|$|R
25|$|The mural in the Punjab Library (adjacent to Lahore Museum) {{is mounted}} in the library hall located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor.</b> All four {{sections}} of the mural have been disassembled and dismounted because of {{the damage to the}} building due to water seepage.|$|E

The rectangular annex consists of entrance <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor,</b> with block windows and upper-level windows align asymmetrically from the door (one on the left, and two to the right on both levels). Directly above this doorway is a bell-tower niche, surmounted by a cross.|$|E
25|$|Beneath the Calvary {{and the two}} chapels there, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor,</b> {{there is}} the Chapel of Adam. According to tradition, Jesus was crucified over the place where Adam's skull was buried. According to some, at the crucifixion, the blood of Christ ran down the cross and through the rocks to fill the skull of Adam. The Rock of Calvary appears cracked through {{a window on the}} altar wall, with the crack {{traditionally}} claimed to be caused by the earthquake that occurred when Jesus died on the cross, while some scholars claim it {{to be the result of}} quarrying against a natural flaw in the rock.|$|E
50|$|The $25 million {{center is}} the largest indoor arena in Mississippi, with 48000 sq ft of {{climate-controlled}} exhibit space <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> arena <b>floor.</b> It has a seating capacity of 6,000 and paved parking for 1,100 vehicles, plus 600 additional parking spaces and 66 RV spaces.|$|R
50|$|Starting in 2002, {{downtown}} Oak Lawn (95th Street between Tulley and 55th Court) {{became the}} target of a massive redevelopment program; properties <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north and south sides of 95th Street were demolished. Eventually several square blocks were leveled, making room for several multistory, high-end condominium complexes with retail space <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floors.</b> Part of <b>the</b> project was the expansion of the Metra commuter train station that houses a retail/office center and a new children's museum. This complex also includes a multistory parking garage. Downtown Oak Lawn as seen today bears little resemblance to the downtown from 2002. It now features modern high-rise buildings, new shopping areas, a large contemporary Metra train station, and several new retail and service facilities.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} {{features the}} unusual {{combination of a}} Moorish-style keyhole doorway surmounted by a Russian-style dome.

25|$|Sickler Hall, {{the oldest}} of three {{remaining}} original buildings on the campus, was built in 1902 with {{a gift from the}} estate of Christopher Sickler, an early Taylor trustee. Originally, the building was a residence hall that provided free housing for the children of ministers and missionaries. Later, it served as a science hall and educational department center; more recently, it was the location of the communication arts department. Remodeled in 1995, Sickler Hall currently houses the William Taylor Foundation, professional writing department, and alumni and parent relations. A campus prayer chapel is located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor</b> and is open 24 hours a day for personal worship, meditation, and prayer.|$|E
25|$|The University of Ottawa Museum of Classical Antiquities was {{established}} in 1975 as a teaching collection, operated by the Department of Classical and Religious Studies.

The university also houses a student-run gallery space, known as Gallery 115 <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor</b> of 100 Laurier East. The student-run gallery provides students the opportunity to work within a gallery setting. It provides graduate and undergraduate students a chance to develop curatorial and administrative skills, as well as, display their own art pieces. In co-operation with the University of Ottawa, the Gallery operates under a democratic structure representing many students enrolled in various programs, including Visual Arts, Art History and Art Administration.|$|E
25|$|Novelty acts (such as shower shows, fire shows, and oil wrestling) can be {{presented}} on dedicated stages, temporary staging on the floor, {{or on the}} main stage itself depending on the club. The main stage, if used, must be prepared and possibly covered to prevent damage, as accidents and injuries have been reported during these types of striptease performances. When dangerous materials such as fire are used as props a permit {{may be required to}} be compliant with local ordinances. Novelty acts are typically performed by feature dancers or by select house dancers during a featured performance. Shower shows require special equipment, so {{they are more likely to}} have a dedicated stage in the club with house dancers performing in the show. Optional staging can be present <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>floor</b> or in dedicated rooms throughout larger clubs.|$|E
50|$|Bishop Hendricken, however, was re-entombed on December 8, 2006, in a {{sarcophagus}} located <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cathedral's <b>main</b> <b>floor,</b> in <b>the</b> West Transept. Eight seniors {{from the}} high school {{that bears his name}} carried his remains to a more public resting place facing the high altar of the great cathedral he built.|$|R
50|$|The church hired Kahn in 1964 {{to design}} an addition, which was {{completed}} in 1969.

Built on a slope, it has two <b>main</b> <b>floors</b> and a lower level at its easternmost end, with complex windows <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two <b>main</b> <b>floors.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Chill-out music {{emerged in}} the early and mid-1990s in [...] "chill rooms" [...] at dance clubs, where {{relaxing}} music was played to allow dancers a chance to [...] "chill out" [...] from the more emphatic and fast-tempo music played <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>main</b> dance <b>floor.</b> Some notable chill-out artists include: Moby, Air, Paul Kalkbrenner, and Moonbootica.|$|R
