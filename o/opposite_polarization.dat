25|$|Linear polarizers can {{be divided}} into two general categories: {{absorptive}} polarizers, where the unwanted polarization states are absorbed by the device, and beam-splitting polarizers, where the unpolarized beam is split into two beams with <b>opposite</b> <b>polarization</b> states. Polarizers which maintain the same axes of polarization with varying angles of incidence are often called Cartesian polarizers, since the polarization vectors can be described with simple Cartesian coordinates (for example, horizontal vs. vertical) independent from the orientation of the polarizer surface. When the two polarization states are relative to the direction of a surface (usually found with Fresnel reflection), they are usually termed s and p. This distinction between Cartesian and s–p polarization can be negligible in many cases, but it becomes significant for achieving high contrast and with wide angular spreads of the incident light.|$|E

Switching the polarization of the ferroelectric material by applying a positive or negative voltage across the junction can lead to a two order of magnitude resistance variation: [...] (an effect called Tunnel Electro-Resistance). In general, the polarization does not switch abruptly. The reversal occurs gradually through the nucleation and growth of ferroelectric domains with <b>opposite</b> <b>polarization.</b> During this process, the resistance is neither RON or ROFF, but in between. When the voltage is cycled, the ferroelectric domain configuration evolves, allowing a fine tuning of the resistance value. The ferroelectric memristor's main advantages are that ferroelectric domain dynamics can be tuned, offering a way to engineer the memristor response, and that the resistance variations are due to purely electronic phenomena, aiding device reliability, as no deep change to the material structure is involved.|$|E

25|$|Polarization is {{important}} in radio communications because, for instance, if one attempts to use a horizontally polarized antenna to receive a vertically polarized transmission, the signal strength will be substantially reduced (or under very controlled conditions, reduced to nothing). This principle is used in satellite television in order to double the channel capacity over a fixed frequency band. The same frequency channel {{can be used for}} two signals broadcast in <b>opposite</b> <b>polarizations.</b> By adjusting the receiving antenna for one or the other polarization, either signal can be selected without interference from the other.|$|R
2500|$|If {{the signal}} from one {{polarization}} channel is {{received by the}} oppositely polarized antenna, it will cause crosstalk that degrades the signal-to-noise ratio. [...] The ability of an antenna to keep these orthogonal channels separate is measured by a parameter called cross polarization discrimination (XPD). [...] In a transmitting antenna, XPD is the fraction of power from an antenna of one polarization radiated in the other polarization. [...] For example, due to minor imperfections a dish with a vertically polarized feed antenna will radiate {{a small amount of}} its power in horizontal polarization; this fraction is the XPD. [...] In a receiving antenna, the XPD is the ratio of signal power received of the <b>opposite</b> <b>polarization</b> to power received in the same antenna of the correct polarization, when the antenna is illuminated by two orthogonally polarized radio waves of equal power.

50|$|The probe {{inside the}} LNB {{waveguide}} collects signals that are polarized {{in the same}} plane as the probe. To maximise {{the strength of the}} wanted signals (and to minimise reception of unwanted signals of the <b>opposite</b> <b>polarization),</b> the probe is aligned with the polarization of the incoming signals. This is most simply achieved by adjusting the LNB's skew; its rotation about the waveguide axis. To remotely select between the two polarizations, and to compensate for inaccuracies of the skew angle, it used to be common to fit a polarizer in front of the LNB's waveguide mouth. This either rotates the incoming signal with an electromagnet around the waveguide (a magnetic polarizer) or rotates an intermediate probe within the waveguide using a servo motor (a mechanical polarizer) but such adjustable skew polarizers are rarely used today.|$|E

40|$|Spin-orbit {{coupling}} (SOC) can induce spin polarization in nonmagnetic 3 D crystals {{when the}} inversion symmetry is broken, as manifested by the bulk Rashba (R- 1) and Dresselhaus (D- 1) effects. We determine that these spin polarization effects originate fundamentally from specific atomic site asymmetries, {{rather than from}} the generally accepted asymmetry of the crystal space-group. This understanding leads to the recognition that a previously overlooked hidden form of spin polarization should exist in centrosymmetric materials. Although all energy bands must be doubly degenerate in centrosymmetric materials, we find that the two components of such doubly degenerate bands could have <b>opposite</b> <b>polarizations</b> each spatially localized on one of the two separate sectors forming the inversion partners. We demonstrate such hidden spin polarizations in centrosymmetric crystals (denoted as R- 2 and D- 2) by first-principles calculations.

This Kondo regime, closely related to the SU(4) Kondo, flips spin from one to zero through cotunneling processes that generate almost totally spin-polarized currents with opposite spin orientation along the two channels. Moreover, by appropriately changing the gate voltages of both quantum dots, one can simultaneously flip the spin polarization of the currents in each channel. As a similar zero magnetic field Kondo effect has been recently observed by Y. Okazaki et al. [Phys. Rev.
