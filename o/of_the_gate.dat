The gates themselves were normally wooden with metal covering plates to prevent destruction by fire. Some gates had portcullises. Postern gates were built into towers or near them to allow sorties.|$|E

5|$|Several {{literary}} descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> survive. Procopius is {{the earliest}} and most prominent source, but {{accounts of the}} statues decorating the gatehouse's façade also come from the later Parastaseis syntomoi chronikai.|$|E
5|$|According {{to one of}} {{the many}} Greek legends about the Constantinople's fall to the Ottomans, when the Turks entered the city, an angel rescued the emperor Constantine XI Palaiologos, turned him into marble and placed him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again to conquer the city back for Christians. The legend {{explained}} the later walling up <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> as a Turkish precaution against this prophecy.|$|E
5|$|Although its {{population}} had dropped below a thousand {{by the late}} 1920s, in 1927 the state replaced the stage road with what eventually became Highway 82.

When he inadvertently received a black eye while he was helping the team with their punting drills, his father had to talk his mother out of making him come back home.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Klein {{served in}} the royal house guard for the King of France, holding the prestigious {{position}} as guard <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate.</b> He left military service in 1787.

40|$|It is {{suggested}} that <b>the</b> delayed rise <b>of</b> <b>gating</b> currents may result from a dielectric relaxation process within <b>the</b> membrane, not <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gating</b> systems themselves but <b>of</b> molecules in <b>the</b> neighborhood <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gating</b> systems. Such dielectric relaxation may prevent the electric fields at <b>the</b> locations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> from rapidly attaining their final, "clamped," values. Calculations based on this concept, using the Hodgkin Huxley m-process as an example, are shown to lead to gating currents whose shapes {{are similar to those}} observed experimentally. One possible interpretation in terms of membrane structure is proposed...|$|R

5|$|James Graham's {{exploits}} at Waterloo {{became much}} celebrated throughout Great Britain, and many {{accounts of the}} battle make reference to his actions, including a biography of Wellington, the memoirs of another sergeant, and Charles Dickens' magazine Household Words.

A watercolour portrait of Sergeant Graham himself is held at the National Gallery of Ireland.|$|E
5|$|QPR's {{victory was}} the first {{occasion}} a team from the Third Division had won a major trophy in England. Both teams received £18,000 as their share <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> receipts. QPR's victory created {{a problem for the}} Football League management committee. On previous occasions, one of the three nominations for the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup was the winner of the League Cup. However, the Fairs Cup committee required that only teams from the highest tier of a nation's league system could enter. In the end, Nottingham Forest, Leeds United and Liverpool qualified for the following season's competition.|$|E
5|$|The {{actions of}} Graham and Macdonnell {{continue}} {{to be remembered as}} an iconic moment in the battle of Waterloo. In 1915, cigarette manufacturers W.D. & H.O. Wills portrayed Graham and Macdonnell on one of the cigarette cards printed to commemorate the centenary of Waterloo. Since then, many authors of fiction concerning Waterloo have recreated the events at the gate, and even if they include their own fictional heroes they attribute the closing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> to Macdonnell and Graham.|$|E

The rear side of the façade, which is seen after entering through the gate, has many rooms and the library.

5|$|Also on Nanking's {{eastern side}} but further south, other {{units of the}} SEA faced the {{difficult}} task of fording the large moat standing between them and three of the city gates, Zhongshan Gate, Guanghua Gate, and Tongji Gate, though the speed of Japan's earlier advance played in their favor as key Chinese units slated to be deployed here were not yet in position. That evening, Japanese engineers and artillerymen closing in on Guanghua Gate managed to blow a hole in the wall. A Japanese battalion launched a daring attack through the gap and planted a Japanese flag on a portion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate,</b> but was immediately pinned down by a series of determined Chinese counterattacks. The Chinese brought up reinforcements, including tanks, and they poured down grenades and even flaming, gasoline-soaked lumber onto the Japanese battalion, which was only saved from annihilation by timely bursts of concentrated artillery fire from the rest of their division. The battalion succeeded in holding its position {{for the rest of the}} battle despite losing eighty of its eighty-eight men.|$|E
5|$|At the north-west {{corner of}} the walls stands Arundel tower, another large drum tower that {{originally}} overlooked a small cliff. South of this is Catchcold tower. Catchcold tower {{was designed to be}} defended with guns and has three gunports; the need to support cannon leaves it much heavier in appearance than the other circular towers on the walls. The remains of machine gun mountings fitted to the tower in 1941 can still be seen. The Arcades form part of the surviving west walls and are a unique feature in England; their closest architectural equivalent are in Rouen, France. The West Gate still stands three storeys high and was originally defended by two portcullises; the windows on the west side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> are the original medieval designs. Along {{the south side of the}} walls one of the twin towers protecting the South Gate still stands, largely intact.|$|E

Facchetti scored again in Bulgaria, but {{his goal was}} cancelled out by Nikolay Radlev, meaning that a play-off was needed to settle the tie.
