A plan to distribute content through downloads paid by micropayment was initially met with criticism by customers due to its alleged low value, but later releases—at a reduced price, and with more content—proved more popular.|$|E

The local chieftains took {{advantage}} of these conditions to re-establish their independence. Subsequently, the Arabs constructed the city of Mansurah {{on the other side}} of the wide and deep Indus, which was safe from attack. This became their new capital in Sindh. Thus began the reign of the imperial Gurjara-Pratiharas.|$|E
25|$|The Bold and the Beautiful (often {{referred}} to as B) is an American television soap opera created by William J. Bell and Lee Phillip Bell for CBS. It premiered on March 23, 1987 as a sister show to the Bells' other soap opera The Young and the Restless; several characters {{from each of the}} two shows have crossed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> since the early 1990s.

25|$|It {{may occur}} that systems of {{coordinates}} for two {{different sets of}} geometric figures are equivalent {{in terms of their}} analysis. An example of this is the systems of homogeneous coordinates for points and lines in the projective plane. The two systems {{in a case like this}} are said to be dualistic. Dualistic systems have the property that results from one system can be carried <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> since these results are only different interpretations of the same analytical result; this is known as the principle of duality.|$|E

These effects can be ascribed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> convergence of tactile and visual inputs onto neural centers which contain flexible multisensory representations of body parts.|$|R

25|$|In Samarra, meanwhile, {{plans were}} {{developed}} to attack al-Anbar, and soon al-Mu'tazz sent a force of Turks and North Africans to take the town. The defense at al-Anbar was split into two groups, with the reinforcements stationed outside {{the town and the}} Bedouins within. When the Samarran army arrived before al-Anbar, they caught the reinforcements by surprise and quickly fell upon them. Some of the defenders put up a fight, but they soon fled, with many of them killed or becoming prisoners. When the commander of the town saw the reinforcements flee, he decided to abandon his post. He and his troops crossed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side of the river, cut the pontoon bridge, and made their way back to Baghdad.|$|E
25|$|On 17 April, Kormoran sighted a {{passenger}} ship, {{but was unable}} to lure her into range before the vessel disappeared into a rain squall. Two days later, Kormoran met Atlantis and the blockade runner Dresden. An expected shipment of white metal for Kormoran had been supplied to a different blockade runner, which was delayed. Several supply ships arrived at the rendezvous point {{over the next few days}} and transferred provisions, ammunition, and fuel to the raider. Prisoners from Kormoran were handed <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> ships, and the raider received new sailors to make up numbers.

25|$|From 16 October, No. 451 Squadron was redeployed to Foggia in Italy. By {{the time}} the ground crew arrived at Naples on 23 October the {{headquarters}} of the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces had decided that {{there was no need for}} the squadron in Italy and recommended that it be returned to Australia. By this time it was not practical to deploy the squadron to the Pacific as the RAAF fighter units there were under-employed, and the squadron's training and equipment were not suited to it joining the other RAAF squadrons in Italy with the Desert Air Force. As a result, it was eventually decided to transfer No. 451 Squadron to the United Kingdom, and its personnel embarked at Naples on 17 November after handing its Spitfires <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> units of 251 Wing.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the steel}} columns were erected for the {{basement}} car park, the steelwork to the suspended ground floor was installed. Barrett then erected the 11 storey frame above this concrete base. Below the slab, Barrett Steel Buildings {{had already left}} studs on the columns which allowed Kier to erect the RC basement beams later on. For the steel frame, Barrett split the project into halves and erected three floors on one side before moving <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> This allowed the decking to be laid on the first side {{as well as the}} concrete floors. The programming meant Barrett was always erecting steelwork at least two levels ahead of the concreting team. The erection of steelwork was completed on Phase 2 by the end of 2007. The glass cladding is currently being installed. Kier Group's contract is due to expire when the building is completed in February 2009.|$|E
25|$|Maroto was in Toledo as {{commanding}} general of that province {{when he was}} visited by Ignacio de Negri y Mendizábal, Count of Negri, {{one of the principal}} Carlist conspirators of 1833. After their conversation, Maroto spent some time considering the revolutionary cause and finally decided, with great calm and certainty, to join it. He was asked if, given his position and standing {{at the head of a}} garrison, he could carry out a military coup, which would have given great support to the cause. Rafael Maroto was a proper and loyal man, and this proposal did not seem ethical to him. He did not want his enlistment in the Carlist ranks to start with a betrayal of the flag to which he had sworn allegiance, or with a flight. He decided to follow a legal path, and started by resigning his command and position within the comandancia general. Once he had broken this link, nothing was in the way of his going <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side.|$|E

After that we crossed back <b>over</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> side and transported other janissaries over the Danube, and when the entire infantry had crossed over, then we prepared and set out gradually against Vlad's army, together with the artillery and other equipment that we had brought with us. Having halted, we set up the cannon, but not in time to stop three hundred janissaries from being killed ... Seeing that our side was greatly weakening, we defended ourselves with the 120 guns which we had brought over and fired so often that we repelled the prince's army and greatly strengthened our position ... Vlad, seeing {{that he could not}} prevent the crossing, withdrew. After that the emperor crossed the Danube with his entire army and gave us 30,000 coins to be distributed among us.|$|E

50|$|BMW CleanEnergy {{vehicles}} {{have both}} a hydrogen and a petrol tank. If {{one of the}} tanks is empty, the bivalent BMW engine unit switches <b>over</b> automatically <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> fuel system. One decisive advantage of the combustion engine is bivalence. It enables both hydrogen and petrol to be used, thus creating the ideal conditions for a transition from non-regenerative to regenerative drive energies. During electrolysis water is split into its components of hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is stored and the oxygen is needed in the vehicle for the combustion of the hydrogen. The combustion process generates energy and water as a waste product, which returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> natural water cycle. And so {{with the aid of}} regenerative energy suppliers, a theoretically emission-free fuel is obtained.|$|R
