The kaolin surface had been pre-treated with 3 -mercaptopropyltrimethoxysilane to improve its dispersion in the rubbers. For natural rubber, the hardness and Young’s modulus improved, tensile strength and tear energy were unchanged and the remaining properties deteriorated when kaolin was added. The viscosity increased and the scorch and <b>optimum</b> <b>cure</b> times decreased whilst the cure rate rose with kaolin. For polybutadiene rubber and ethylene-propylene-diene rubber, {{with the exception of the}} compression set resistance, all the properties including the viscosity gained from the kaolin. The kaolin was found to be extending or non-reinforcing filler for natural rubber, and highly reinforcing for polybutadiene rubber and EPDM.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{bio-based}} bio-phenol-formaldehyde (BPF) resoles were prepared using hydrolytically depolymerized Kraft lignin (DKL) as bio-phenol to partially substitute phenol. The effects of phenol substitution ratio, weight-average molecular weight (Mw) of DKL and formaldehyde-to-phenol (F/P) ratio {{were also investigated}} to find the <b>optimum</b> <b>curing</b> temperature for BPF resoles. The results indicated that DKL with Mw ~ 1200 g/mol provides a curing temperature of less than 180 °C for any substitution level, provided that F/P ratios are controlled. Incorporation of lignin reduced the curing temperature of the resin, however, higher Mw DKL negatively affected the curing process. For any level of lignin Mw, the curing temperature was found to increase with lower F/P ratios at lower phenol substitution levels. At 25 % and 50 % phenol substitution, increasing the F/P ratio allows for synthesis of resoles with lower curing temperatures. Increasing the phenol substitution from 50 % to 75 % allows for {{a broader range of}} lignin Mw to attain low curing temperatures...|$|R

30|$|Optimized {{finishing}} {{parameters and}} related physical properties of finished cotton with modified DMDHEU and citric acid {{are shown in}} Tables  12, 13 and 14 respectively. Modified DMDHEU and CA both produced good DP rating (≥ 3.5) at 60  gpl with respective concentration of catalyst at 20 % (MgCl 2) and 65 – 70 % (SHP) respectively; the latter resulted in more tendering of finished cotton. Citric acid itself developed a pH of around 2.7 – 3 in bath and further addition of SHP increased acidity causing severe tendering. The <b>optimum</b> <b>curing</b> temperature was 160 and 180  °C for modified DMDHEU and CA respectively to obtain DP rating of ≥ 3.5. Higher curing temperature caused high strength loss and yellowing of finished cotton. More concentration of SS and PE was required for modified DMDHEU because of stiffness developed compared to lesser concentrations of these two in CA based formulation. TCRA was better with modified DMDHEU while CA caused more loss in tensile and tear strength. Citric acid produced yellowing of fabric which was removed by conditioning it in open.

The intercalation behaviour of PEG into the OMMT clay galleries and its interaction with clay platelets were characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetric techniques. A natural rubber (NR) -organoclay nanocomposite (NROCN) was prepared by melt-compounding of NR with PEG-treated organoclay (P-OMMT) and other compounding chemicals using a laboratory-scale internal mixer.
