5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} {{contains}} two distinct groups of neurons. The first group coexpresses neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and has stimulatory inputs to the LH and inhibitory inputs to the VMH. The second group coexpresses pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) and has stimulatory inputs to the VMH and inhibitory inputs to the LH. Consequently, NPY/AgRP neurons stimulate feeding and inhibit satiety, while POMC/CART neurons stimulate satiety and inhibit feeding. Both groups of arcuate nucleus neurons are regulated {{in part by}} leptin. Leptin inhibits the NPY/AgRP group while stimulating the POMC/CART group. Thus a deficiency in leptin signaling, either via leptin deficiency or leptin resistance, leads to <b>overfeeding</b> and may account for some genetic and acquired forms of obesity.|$|E
25|$|In the wild, {{the diet}} of {{goldfish}} consists of crustaceans, insects, and various plant matter. Like most fish, they are opportunistic feeders {{and do not}} stop eating on their own accord. <b>Overfeeding</b> can be deleterious to their health, typically by blocking the intestines. This happens most often with selectively bred goldfish, which have a convoluted intestinal tract. When excess food is available, they produce more waste and faeces, partly due to incomplete protein digestion. <b>Overfeeding</b> can sometimes be diagnosed by observing faeces trailing from the fish's cloaca.|$|E

25|$|Physical {{inactivity}} as a {{child could}} result in physical inactivity as an adult. In a fitness survey of 6,000 adults, researchers discovered that 25% {{of those who were}} considered active at ages 14 to 19 were also active adults, compared to 2% of those who were inactive at ages 14 to 19, who were now said to be active adults. Staying physically inactive leaves unused energy in the body, most of which is stored as fat. Researchers studied 16 men over a 14-day period and fed them 50% more of their energy required every day through fats and carbohydrates. They discovered that carbohydrate <b>overfeeding</b> produced 75–85% excess energy being stored as body fat and fat <b>overfeeding</b> produced 90–95% storage of excess energy as body fat.|$|E
30|$|One of the {{significant}} texturing processes in current use, air-jet texturing, operates by mechanical interlocking and not by heat setting {{in the case of}} the other texturing techniques such as false-twist. It is a cold fluid texturing process that converts flat, continuous synthetic filament yarns into an entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun-like yarn. Air-jet texturing has three types based on the supply yarn. Single-end air-jet texturing denotes the situation whereby single filament yarn is overfed to the texturing nozzle, and the resultant textured yarn is withdrawn. In case of parallel air-jet texturing, two or more filaments yarns are fed at the same <b>overfeed</b> into the nozzle so as to facilitate a blend of different types of supply material, or of the same material but with different filament linear densities or number of filaments, or different cross sectional shapes. In core-effect air-jet texturing two different filament yarns are fed under different <b>overfeeds</b> into the air-jet at the same time. In core-effect air-jet texturing, the lower <b>overfeed</b> yarn is called the core-yarn and the higher <b>overfeed</b> yarn is called the effect-yarn. The core-yarn <b>overfeed</b> determines the strength of the textured yarn. The effect-yarn <b>overfeed</b> determines the size of the protruded loops. It also has an indirect influence upon the number of loops per unit length and also on the linear density. Perhaps the most important influence of the effect-yarn <b>overfeed</b> is to be seen in the structure and appearance of the yarn. This is because loops are seen on the surface of the yarn in the same way that hairs are visible in a spun yarn. However, there is limited literature on core-effect air-jet texturing or the influence of the effect-yarn parameters on air-jet texturing performance. Researchers have not given adequate prominence in core-effect air-jet texturing and most of the research limited to single-end air-je texturing. Wickramasinghe (2003) has investigated the use of steam as an alternative fluid for air in spun-like textured yarn manufacturing and studied the performance of sewing threads manufactured using core-effect steam-jet textured yarns. He reported that steam could be used as an alternative fluid for air in manufacturing core-effect spun-like textured sewing threads.|$|R

30|$|Increasing effect-yarn {{draw and}} effect-yarn <b>overfeed</b> {{increases}} {{the level of}} texturing and reduces strength, elongation and tenacity in both steam-jet and air-jet textured yarn. When the steam-jet textured yarn is considered, {{it can be concluded}} that spun-like textured yarn can be made satisfactorily using steam as an alternative fluid to air. Steam-jet textured yarn has a similar filament entanglement structure to air-jet textured yarn. Steam-jet textured yarn has a stronger and more compact structure than air-jet textured yarn where the steam-jet yarn loops are shrunken due the effect of heat setting. Furthermore, steam-jet textured yarn has less shrinkage and therefore post intermingled heat setting could be eliminated and the production cost of the spun-like textured yarn using steam could further be reduced. Increasing effect-yarn <b>overfeed</b> increases the loop density of textured yarns and therefore have more protruding loops in the textured yarn structure. However, higher effect-yarn <b>overfeed</b> increase the effect-yarn consumption and increase the linear density of the textured yarn. This would increase the production cost per unit length of yarn.|$|R

25|$|UCP1 is {{a protein}} {{predominantly}} found in BAT. It acts to dissipate the proton gradient generated by oxidative phosphorylation, {{leading to the}} production of heat. Release of catecholamines from sympathetic nerves results in UCP1 activation and usually occurs after extended periods of cold exposure or in response to <b>overfeeding.</b> UCP1 activity is stimulated by long chain fatty acids that are produced subsequent to β-adrenergic receptor activation. UCP1 is proposed to function as a fatty acid proton symporter, although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated. In contrast, UCP1 is inhibited by ATP, ADP, and GTP.|$|E
25|$|Obesity can unfavorably alter {{hormonal}} and metabolic status via {{resistance to}} the hormone leptin, and a vicious cycle may occur in which insulin/leptin resistance and obesity aggravate one another. The vicious cycle is putatively fueled by continuously high insulin/leptin stimulation and fat storage, {{as a result of}} high intake of strongly insulin/leptin stimulating foods and energy. Both insulin and leptin normally function as satiety signals to the hypothalamus in the brain; however, insulin/leptin resistance may reduce this signal and therefore allow continued <b>overfeeding</b> despite large body fat stores. In addition, reduced leptin signaling to the brain may reduce leptin's normal effect to maintain an appropriately high metabolic rate.|$|E
25|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome can be induced by <b>overfeeding</b> with sugar or fructose, particularly concomitantly with high-fat diet. The resulting oversupply of omega-6 fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid (AA), {{is an important}} factor in the pathogenesis of {{metabolic syndrome}}. Arachidonic acid (with its precursor - linoleic acid) serve as a substrate to the production of inflammatory mediators known as eicosanoids, whereas the arachidonic acid-containing compound diacylglycerol (DAG) is a precursor to the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) while fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) mediates the metabolism of arachidonic acid into anandamide. Anandamide can also be produced from N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine via several pathways. Anandamide and 2-AG can also be hydrolized into arachidonic acid, potentially leading to increased eicosanoid synthesis.|$|E

40|$|Stress-strain {{properties}} including loop strength, {{stress relaxation}} and elastic recovery of air-textured PES/PES core-wrap sewing threads manufactured on “Eltex ” air-texturing machine with HemaJet ® air-texturing nozzle are investigated. Torlen FY HT PES 13. 3 tex multifilament yarn distinguished by increased strength {{was used as}} raw material. Two PES yarns were fed to the nozzle as core threads and one as wrap effect. The properties of threads manufactured alternatively with thermosetting and without it are studied in dependence on <b>overfeed</b> of wrap yarn and pressure of air fed into the texturing nozzle. ZWICK/ROELL BDO-FBO. 5 TH testing machine with a 50 N load cell was used performing the tests. Mechanical properties of the PES multifilament yarns are markedly changed by air-texturing. Breaking tenacities of PES/PES air-textured sewing threads are only one half of those of the raw PES yarn due to core-wrap structure of the air-textured threads and the disordering of filaments of core threads during air-texturing. PES/PES threads are pretty less responsive to loop testing if comparing with straight thread test than the raw PES yarn. Air-pressure and <b>overfeed</b> in texturing are influential factors in respect of stress-strain properties and loop strength of air-textured PES/PES sewing threads. Their influence is markedly affected by thread thermosetting: lower air pressure and <b>overfeed</b> values are advantageous factors while texturing without thermosetting but they are disadvantageous ones while texturing with thermosetting.
