5|$|The DOB {{spread to}} Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles, and The Ladder {{was mailed to}} hundreds—eventually thousands—of DOB members {{discussing}} the nature of homosexuality, sometimes challenging {{the idea that it}} was a sickness, with readers offering their <b>own</b> <b>reasons</b> why they were lesbians, and suggesting ways to cope with the condition or society's response to it. British lesbians followed with the publication of Arena Three beginning in 1964, with a similar mission.|$|E
5|$|Turner had his <b>own</b> <b>reasons</b> {{for wanting}} Alderson gone, {{following}} the Battle of St-Eloi in April 1916. After British troops {{had taken a}} large crater near {{the ruins of the}} Belgian town of St Eloi, a brigade of Turner's division was ordered to hold the gain against German counter-attacks. Due to dreadful management of the Canadian forces by Turner and Brigadier-General Huntly Ketchen, German soldiers overran the crater, causing 1,400 Canadian casualties and retaking the land around the crater, negating the gains made at heavy cost just a few days before. Sir Herbert Plumer, the commander of British 2nd Army who had overall responsibility for the front, demanded Ketchen's immediate dismissal and when Turner claimed that if Ketchen was dismissed he would resign, Alderson sought his dismissal as well. Both officers were supporters of Sam Hughes, who made it clear in no uncertain terms to Commander in Chief Sir Douglas Haig that if Turner went then Haig could no longer rely on Canadian support.|$|E

5|$|Two {{versions}} {{of the events that}} {{led to the creation of}} the new archdiocese appear in the form of an exchange of letters in 798 between Coenwulf and Pope Leo III. Coenwulf asserted in his letter that Offa wanted the new archdiocese created out of enmity for Jaenberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury at the time of the division; but Leo responded that the only reason the papacy agreed to the creation was because of the size of the kingdom of Mercia. The comments of both Coenwulf and Leo are partisan, as each had his <b>own</b> <b>reasons</b> for representing the situation as they did: Coenwulf was entreating Leo to make London the sole southern archdiocese, while Leo was concerned to avoid the appearance of complicity with the unworthy motives Coenwulf imputed to Offa. Coenwulf's desire to move the southern archbishopric to London would have been influenced by the situation in Kent, where Archbishop Æthelheard had been forced to flee by Eadberht Præn. Coenwulf would have wished to retain control over the archiepiscopal seat, and at the time he wrote to the pope Kent was independent of Mercia.|$|E
5|$|Pope Pius II's {{crusade against}} the Ottoman Empire was {{declared}} in November 1463. Skanderbeg, {{the leader of}} the Albanians, was a vital ally to this effort and would have become one of its main leaders. The Venetians, who had also joined the crusade, could not persuade Lekë Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's lukewarm ally in northern Albania, to join until the pope intervened. Furthermore, the major European powers were reluctant to join the pope's crusade. Among those inquired were the city of Florence, Francisco Sforza of Milan, Louis XI of France, and Ferdinand I of Naples, all of whom declined for their <b>own</b> <b>reasons.</b> The Republic of Venice, however, decided to aid Skanderbeg by sending 500 cavalry and 500 infantry under the condottiero Antonio da Cosenza, also known as Cimarosto. Once the campaign season began, Mathias Corvinus of Hungary recaptured many of the Bosnian strongpoints, including Jajce, which had been taken from the Kingdom of Bosnia by the Ottomans. Mehmed II marched into Bosnia, pillaging the countryside, hoping that his enemies would surrender. The Hungarian resistance, however, was stiff. The Ottomans still managed to make headway against the Hungarians who had been trying to lift Ottoman the siege on Jajce with a ruse. The Sultan continued his siege while Mathias escaped from the fortress with a force of men, but the retreating army was harried with two-hundred soldiers being captured and sent to Constantinople for execution. Despite the setback, Jajce held out and Mehmed retreated from Bosnia.|$|E
5|$|The first Mortal Kombat game {{takes place}} in Earthrealm (Earth) where seven {{different}} warriors with their <b>own</b> <b>reasons</b> for entering participated in the tournament with the eventual prize being the continued freedom of their realm, threatened with a takeover by Outworld. Among the established warriors were Liu Kang, Johnny Cage and Sonya Blade. With {{the help of the}} thunder god Raiden, the Earthrealm warriors were victorious and Liu Kang became the new champion of Mortal Kombat. In Mortal Kombat II, unable to deal with his minion Shang Tsung's failure, Outworld Emperor Shao Kahn lures the Earthrealm warriors to the Outworld where the Earthrealm warriors eventually defeat Shao Kahn. By the time of Mortal Kombat 3, Shao Kahn revives Edenia's (now a part of his Outworld domain) former queen Sindel in Earthrealm, combining it with Outworld as well. He then attempts to invade Earthrealm but is ultimately defeated by the Earthrealm warriors again. After Kahn's defeat, Edenia was freed from Kahn's grasp and returned to a peaceful realm, ruled by Princess Kitana. The following game, Mortal Kombat 4, features the former elder god Shinnok attempting to conquer the realms and attempting to kill the thunder god Raiden. However, he is also defeated by the Earthrealm warriors.|$|E

Although Chinese had their <b>own</b> <b>reasons</b> to enter the war (i.e. a {{strategic}} buffer zone in the Korean peninsula), the view that the Soviets had used them as proxies was shared in the Western bloc. China had to use Soviet loans originally intended to rebuild their shattered economy to pay for Soviet arms.|$|E
25|$|The work {{is painted}} as life sized {{and in a}} shallow space, with Bathsheba {{dominating}} the composition as she had in no other earlier version of the scene. It is not known whether Rembrandt painted Bathsheba for his <b>own</b> <b>reasons,</b> or to satisfy a commission. Presumably in response to Rembrandt's painting, his ex-pupil and close associate Willem Drost painted Bathsheba with David's Letter the same year, which {{is also in the}} Louvre.|$|E

25|$|As Bolshevik rule {{took hold}} in Ukraine, the early Soviet {{government}} had its <b>own</b> <b>reasons</b> {{to encourage the}} national movements of the former Russian Empire. While trying to ascertain and consolidate its power, the Bolshevik government was by far more concerned about political oppositions connected to the pre-revolutionary order than about the national movements inside the former empire. Besides, the reversal of the assimilationist policies of the Russian Empire was to help to improve {{the image of the}} Soviet government and boost its popularity among the common people.|$|E
25|$|Street Fighter IV {{takes place}} {{several months after}} the events of Street Fighter II (thus is {{chronologically}} set between Street Fighter II and III).

Each character has their <b>own</b> <b>reasons</b> for entering this tournament, but S.I.N.'s real desire is to lure Ryu to {{them in order to}} analyze the Satsui no Hadō, believed to be the last piece of data needed to complete BLECE.|$|E
25|$|Initially, Jewish {{immigration}} to Palestine met little {{opposition from the}} Palestinian Arabs. However, as anti-Semitism grew in Europe during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Jewish immigration (mostly from Europe) to Palestine began to increase markedly. Combined {{with the growth of}} Arab nationalism in the region and increasing anti-Jewish sentiments the growth of Jewish population created much Arab resentment. The British government placed limitations on Jewish {{immigration to}} Palestine. These quotas were controversial, particularly in the latter years of British rule, and both Arabs and Jews disliked the policy, each for their <b>own</b> <b>reasons.</b>|$|E

Original vocalist Johnson, who announced via the Internet {{that he would not be}} appearing and guitarist Nash, who declined to appear for his <b>own</b> <b>reasons,</b> did not take part.

25|$|The Soviet Union, {{having its}} <b>own</b> <b>reasons</b> {{to fear the}} German eastward expansionism, {{repeatedly}} negotiated with France and the United Kingdom, and through them made an offer to Poland of an anti-German alliance, similar to the earlier one made to Czechoslovakia. The British and the French sought {{the formation of a}} powerful political-military bloc, comprising the Soviet Union, Poland and Romania in the east, and France and Britain in the west. As of May 1939, the Soviet conditions for signing an agreement with Britain and France were as follows: the right of the Red Army troops to pass through Polish territory, the termination of the Polish–Romanian Alliance, and the limitation of the British guarantee to Poland to cover only Poland's western frontier with Germany. The Polish leaders believed that once on Polish territory the Soviet troops would not leave and throughout 1939 refused to agree to any arrangement which would allow Soviet troops to enter Poland.|$|E
25|$|Various {{characters}} are shown entering the fifth DOA tournament, {{which takes place}} at the platform. Each does it for their <b>own</b> <b>reasons,</b> often to either see once more or to defeat some other character. Usually they join it after either being approached by Zack, who is shown finding, fighting and recruiting them around the world. After Tina decides to return to fighting, her father Bass enters it as well, adopting a ring name of Mr. Strong; eventually, they reunite as a team. While stalking Jann Lee, Leifang eventually confronts him before the tournament and there is sexual tension between them. Hitomi, who still hopes to see Ein (Hayate), advances to the quarterfinals, defeating Mila and then Eliot. During a break, Hitomi meets Hayate, who wishes her good luck. Jann Lee, who had won constructive matches against Leifang and Mr. Strong, defeats her, emerging as the winner from the tournament but not attending the championship award ceremony out of a personal grudge for Rig, whom he lost to in an earlier fight.|$|E
