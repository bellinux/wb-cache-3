5|$|All {{five seasons}} of Friday Night Lights were filmed in Austin and Pflugerville. With the show {{yielding}} roughly $33 {{million a year}} in revenue, other states courted the production company after the state of Texas failed to pay all the rebates it had promised to the show's producers. The Texas legislature authorized funding to match the offers <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>states,</b> and the production company preferred to stay near Austin, so the show remained in Texas.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the bill}} granted the Governor of Alaska {{authority}} {{to enter into}} reciprocal mental health treatment agreements with the governors <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>states.</b> Alaskans who became mentally ill in the lower 48 states would be properly treated locally until they could be returned to Alaska; likewise, citizens of the lower 48 who fell mentally ill in Alaska would receive care there, before being returned to their home states.|$|E
5|$|Many later {{attempts}} to draft constitutional forms of government trace their lineage back to Magna Carta.

5|$|Congressional {{delegations}} {{from the}} Southern states, which had lower or no debts, and whose citizens would effectively pay {{a portion of}} the debt <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>states</b> if the federal government assumed it, were disinclined to accept the proposal. Additionally, many in Congress argued that the plan was beyond the constitutional power of the new government. James Madison led the effort to block the provision and prevent the plan from gaining approval. Jefferson approved payment of the domestic and foreign debt at par, but not the assumption of state debts. After Hamilton and Jefferson reached the Compromise of 1790, Hamilton's assumption plan was adopted as the Funding Act of 1790.|$|E
5|$|Despite strong pacifist {{sentiment}} after World War I, {{its aftermath}} still caused irredentist and revanchist nationalism in several European states. These sentiments were especially marked in Germany {{because of the}} significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the Treaty of Versailles. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 per cent of its home territory {{and all of its}} overseas possessions, while German annexation <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>states</b> was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{part due}} to his {{advanced}} years, Kenyatta rarely travelled outside of Eastern Africa. Under Kenyatta, Kenya was largely uninvolved in the affairs <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>states,</b> including those in the East African Community. Despite his reservations about any immediate East African Federation, in June 1967 Kenyatta signed the Treaty for East African Co-operation. In December he attended a meeting with Tanzanian and Ugandan representatives to form the East African Economic Community, reflecting Kenyatta's cautious approach toward regional integration. He also took on a mediating role during the Congo Crisis, heading the Organisation of African Unity's Conciliation Commission on the Congo.|$|E

5|$|Six of Washington's {{territorial}} {{governors and}} four of its state governors have served higher federal or confederate offices, or as governors <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>states.</b> Three represented Washington Territory as delegates to the U.S. House, and one additionally represented Idaho Territory in the same fashion, as well as serving as Governor of Idaho Territory. Two territorial governors represented eastern states, one as a representative from, and governor of, New Jersey, and one represented Virginia both in the United States and Confederate Houses. Three governors represented {{the state in the}} U.S. Senate, and two represented the state in the House. One governor has served in the United States Cabinet. Two of the territorial governors (marked with *) resigned their office to serve as territorial delegates.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} did {{not specify}} whether a plurality or a majority vote was required to elect the governor, but the electors, following a common practice <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>states,</b> decided to hold a second vote between Logan and Garrard {{in order to achieve}} a majority. Most of Todd's electors supported Garrard on the second vote, giving him a majority. In a letter dated May 17, 1796, Kentucky Secretary of State James Brown certified Garrard's election, and Governor Shelby sent him a letter of congratulations on his election on May 27.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other states}} that were created after the war, Rhineland-Palatinate (French zone) and Lower Saxony (British zone), chose to use the black-red-gold tricolour as their flag, defaced with the state's coat of arms. These two states were formed from parts <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>states,</b> and no colour {{combinations}} from these previous states were accepted as a new state flag. This led {{to the use of}} the black-red-gold for two reasons: the colours did not relate particularly to any one of the previous states, and using the old flag from the Weimar Republic was intended to be a symbol of the new democracy.|$|E

5|$|By June 1863, Ohio {{had not yet}} fielded an African American combat unit, but Ohio {{blacks were}} being {{recruited}} for service in the regiments <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>states.</b> Beaty enlisted from Cincinnati on June 7, 1863 for a three-year term of service in the Union Army; he was {{among a group of}} men recruited for a Massachusetts regiment. He joined as a private but was promoted to sergeant only two days later. He was placed in charge of a squad of forty-seven other recruits and ordered to report to Columbus, Ohio, from where they would be sent to Boston. Upon arriving in Columbus on June 15, however, they learned that the Massachusetts regiments were full and unable to accept their service. The Governor of Ohio, David Tod, immediately requested permission from the Department of War to form an Ohio regiment of African Americans. Permission was granted, and on June 17, Beaty and his squad became the first members of the 127th Ohio Volunteer Infantry, later re-designated the 5th United States Colored Troops. After three months of recruitment and organization in Camp Delaware, on the Olentangy River outside of Delaware, Ohio, the unit set out for Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Despite gaining {{considerable}} power {{during the}} mid twentieth-century, {{the governor is}} still much weaker than those <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>states.</b> He has no line-item veto authority, and the pocket veto was ruled unconstitutional. If a governor does not sign or reject a bill, it becomes law automatically. This led to a fist fight during the term of Claude Matthews, who was locked out of the House chambers {{to prevent him from}} returning a bill in time. Vetoes are also easily overridden, requiring only a simple majority as opposed to a supermajority. The legislature still exercises final control over the hiring of state employees, but given the large size of the government and the short legislative sessions, they are unable to make any considerable impact other than their continued advocacy for an expanded merit system. The cabinet is still almost entirely independent of the governor, and he has control over only half of the government's agencies, such as the Indiana State Police and the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Other large agencies, such as the Department of Administration, are {{under the control of the}} cabinet.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, the Organization for European Economic Cooperation (now the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) {{had made}} several {{attempts}} {{to create a}} framework for protecting international investments, but its efforts revealed conflicting views on how to provide compensation for the expropriation of foreign direct investment. In 1961, then-General Counsel of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) Aron Broches developed {{the idea for a}} multilateral agreement on a process for resolving individual investment disputes on a case by case basis as opposed to imposing outcomes based on standards. Broches held conferences to consult legal experts {{from all parts of the}} world, including Europe, Africa, and Asia, to discuss and compose a preliminary agreement. The IBRD staff wrote an official draft of the agreement and consulted with legal representatives of the IBRD's board of directors to finalize the draft and have it approved. The board of directors approved the final draft of the agreement, titled Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals <b>of</b> <b>Other</b> <b>States,</b> and the Bank president disseminated the convention to its member states for signature on 18 March 1965. Twenty states immediately ratified the convention. The convention establishing the ICSID entered into force on 14 October 1966.|$|E

5|$|In June 2009, a {{group of}} {{consumers}} filed the class action suits Owens v. Apple, Inc. and Johnson v. Apple Inc. against Apple on behalf of American individuals who purchased iTunes gift cards and who were then unable to use the cards to purchase iTunes music at the price advertised on the card because Apple raised {{the price of the}} music after it sold the cards to consumers. The Johnson case absorbed the Owens case and was settled on February 10, 2012, with payments to be made to consumers by Apple. The Owens complaint alleged that Apple wrongfully marketed, distributed, and sold iTunes gift cards and songs through its online iTunes store, while representing that consumers could use the gift cards to purchase songs for US$.99 a song and then, after such gift cards were purchased, raised the price on certain songs to $1.29 on April 7, 2009. The lawsuit's allegations included that Apple's conduct constituted breach of contract, violated the state consumer fraud statute, and violated consumer protection statutes <b>of</b> <b>other</b> <b>states.</b> The plaintiffs sought a $.30 refund remedy for each song that class members purchased using a $.99 iTunes card for which they were charged $1.29, plus their attorneys' fees and costs. Apple mounted a vigorous defense and sought to dismiss the suit but lost its motion in December 2009. Individuals are part of the class of plaintiffs if they are U.S. residents who purchased or received an iTunes Gift Card on which the card itself or its packaging contained language to the effect that songs were priced at $0.99 and who used the card to purchase one or more $1.29 songs from the iTunes Store on or before May 10, 2010. The settlement provides class members with an iTunes Store credit of $3.25 if an online claim form was submitted on or before September 24, 2012.|$|E
