500|$|According to Young, {{the music}} on Fascination was a {{progression}} for the band, and a challenge for them. Comparing their prior work to the new album, she said, [...] "They're probably a bit more bluegrass-influenced than this <b>one</b> <b>here.</b> While {{we still have the}} bluegrass and roots music influences, we really wanted to push ourselves harder on this one, something a bit more challenging to play live." [...] She described their music through their fourth album as having evolved, explaining that it began as traditional roots and bluegrass, but after six years is [...] "our own little sound". The track [...] "The Crystal Merchant" [...] was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Instrumental Performance.|$|E

500|$|Bottomley's last public venture was an {{engagement}} at the Windmill Theatre in September 1932, where he performed a monologue of reminiscences that, according to Symons, puzzled rather than amused his audience. Following a health breakdown, {{he lived with}} Primrose in quiet poverty until his final illness. He died in the Middlesex Hospital on 26 May 1933, and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium a few days later. A large crowd heard the Revd Basil Bourchier express the hope that [...] "no <b>one</b> <b>here</b> today will forget what Mr Bottomley did to revive the spirits of our men at the Front". Four years later, in accordance with Bottomley's wishes, Primrose scattered the ashes on the Sussex Downs.|$|E
500|$|Writer Richard Riegel {{evaluated}} the immediate impact of The Soft Parade on the Doors' {{reputation in the}} magazine Creem in 1981: [...] "If Waiting for the Sun set a lot of older hippies to questioning their former perceptions of the Doors as Avatars of the avant-garde, then The Soft Parade finished off their interest in the group." [...] In a review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger was slightly more positive, writing that [...] "about half the record is quite good, especially the huge hit 'Touch Me' (their most successful integration of orchestration)". However, Unterberger felt it is the [...] "weakest studio album recorded with Jim Morrison", as well as [...] "their weakest set of material, low lights including filler like 'Do It' and 'Runnin' Blue'". Compared to prior albums, Morrison's contributions to The Soft Parade were lackluster, putting his credibility as a serious poet and songwriter on the line according to writer James Riordan. Author Danny Sugerman in No <b>One</b> <b>Here</b> Gets Out Alive wrote [...] "overall the lyric impact was less {{than it had been}} on previous albums...horns by some of the top local studio jazz musicians further blurred the once-lucid Doors sound".|$|E

The song features a Europop keyboard in its arrangement. Nathan Rabin from The A.V. Club wrote that the lyrics of [...] "Castle Walls" [...] "offer similarly incisive and only occasionally self-pitying commentary on the tragedy and triumph of being young, black, rich, famous, and a repeat felon." [...] The song begins with the chorus, in which Aguilera sings, [...] "Everyone thinks that I have it all / But it's so empty living behind these castle walls (These castle walls) / If I should tumble if I should fall/ Would anyone hear me screaming behind these castle walls? / There's no <b>one</b> <b>here</b> at all, behind these castle walls." [...] After the chorus, T.I. raps the verse [...] "See with the Phantoms and Ferraris in the driveway / But you see it came in exchange of a sane man's sanity / Your vision jaded by the Grammys on the mantlepiece / Just switch your camera lenses, {{you will see the}} agony" [...] over a [...] "warbling" [...] electronic background and hip hop beats. Towards the song's conclusion, there is a [...] "sad" [...] string arrangement and an electronica-influenced [...] "triumphantly striding beat." [...] An editor from HipHopDX compared [...] "Castle Walls" [...] to [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] by Eminem featuring Rihanna, which was also produced by da Kid.|$|E

500|$|In 1888, Getzein {{compiled}} an 18–22record and a 3.05ERA. [...] He started 46games {{and completed}} 45 {{of them with}} 404innings pitched. However, Getzein lost his role at the team's leading pitcher, as Pete Conway compiled a 30–14record and a 2.25ERA for the 1888 Wolverines. [...] After Getzein gave up 10runs in an August1888 game against Washington, the Detroit Free Press dubbed him the [...] "Pulverized Pretzel." [...] The newspaper reported: [...] "The Detroits were defeated again to-day ... simply because Getzein could not keep the ball away from the Senatorial bat. [...] When he pitched high they hit it. [...] When he delivered his famous drop, he was knocked out of the lot, and his in and out curves were as big as balloons to Ted Sullivan's men." [...] As the 1888season progressed, relations between Getzein and the Detroit manager became strained. [...] After {{a game in which}} Getzein gave up 21hits against Boston, The Sporting Life reported on speculation that Getzein may have intentionally thrown the game: [...] "The Getzein episode makes Detroiters weary. [...] The Bostons have no license to make 21 hits off the Pretzel when he pitches his game. [...] Either he was not in condition to pitch or he didn't try to[...] [...] [...] If the latter, and he repeated his performance against the Kansas Citys a few years ago, when he deliberately tossed the balls to the plate and permitted the Cowboys to make 13 runs in one inning, why no <b>one</b> <b>here</b> would mourn much if he was fined to the limit. [...] What the merits of his quarrel with Watkins are of course are not known here. [...] But Getzein is inclined to be very free with his tongue. [...] Considering his fine treatment here it is time for him to get over his childish humors and do the best he knows how whenever called on." ...|$|E
