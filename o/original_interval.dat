50|$|When {{records are}} {{inserted}} into a control interval, they {{are placed in}} the correct order relative to other records. This may require records to be {{moved out of the}} way inside the control interval. Conversely, when a record is deleted, later records are moved down so that the free space remains contiguous. If there is not enough free space in a control interval for a record to be inserted, the control interval is split. Roughly half the records are stored in the <b>original</b> control <b>interval</b> while the remaining records are moved into a new control interval. The new control interval is taken from a pool of free control intervals within the same control area as the <b>original</b> control <b>interval.</b> If there is no remaining free control interval within that control area, the control area itself is split and the control intervals are distributed equally between {{the old and the new}} control areas.|$|R

One way to model imprecise probabilities is {{to represent a}} probability with the interval between the lowest possible and the highest possible probability, respectively.

Representing an imprecise probability with the distribution’s centre of mass therefore in practice gives much the same result as using an interval, but a single number instead of an interval is computationally easier and avoids problems such as overlapping intervals. We demonstrate why second-order calculations add information when handling imprecise representations, as is the case of decision trees or probabilistic networks. We suggest a measure of belief density for such intervals. We also discuss properties applicable to general distributions. The results herein apply also to approaches which do not explicitly deal with second-order distributions, instead using only first-order concepts such as upper and lower bounds...|$|R

40|$|Separated {{decision-making}} {{for maintenance}} and spare ordering is unrealistic in the industry, so this paper aims to optimize them together. A joint policy of inspection-based preventive maintenance (PM) and spare ordering considering two modes of spare ordering, namely, a regular order and an emergency order, is proposed for single-unit systems using a three-stage failure process. If {{the system is}} recognized {{to be in the}} minor defective stage, the <b>original</b> inspection <b>interval</b> is shortened and a regular order is placed. However, replacement is undertaken preventively or correctively if the severe defective stage is identified or a failure occurs. Depending on the system state and the state of the regular ordered spare when replacement is needed, all possible scenarios are considered to construct optimization model I. The decision variables are the optimal inspection interval and the times of shortening the <b>original</b> inspection <b>interval.</b> Additionally, model II on the basis of an assumption that the spare is always ordered at time 0 is also developed. The results from a numerical example illustrated the applicability and the effectiveness of model I compared to model II, and the irregular inspection policy is validated to be cost-saving compared to the regular inspection policy...|$|R
50|$|Bisection Search Theorem: The bisection search theorem {{is one of}} the {{bracketing}} {{methods for}} finding roots of equations. Assume that function y= f(x) and an interval b which contains a root x* of f(x) that lies somewhere in the interval such that f(c)= 0. The BST systematically moves the end points of the interval closer and closer together in the pace of halving interval for each step until an interval of arbitrarily small width that brackets the zero is obtained. The decision step for this process is first to choose the midpoint c =(a+b) / 2 and then to analyze the three possibilities that might rise. If f (a) and f (b) have opposite signs, a zero lies in c. If f (a) and f (b) have opposite signs, a zero lies in b. If f (c)=0, then the zero is c.

Using this new representation, {{the problem of}} lack of robustness in all state-of-the art CAD systems can be largely overcome. In this paper this concept has been discussed {{to form a new}} curve over rectangular domain such that its parameter varies in an arbitrary range, - instead of standard parameter, -. Where and are real and, we also want that curve gets generated within the given error tolerance limit. The four fixed Kharitonov's polynomials (four fixed Bezier curves) associated with the <b>original</b> <b>interval</b> Bezier curve are obtained. A new parameterization is applied to the four fixed Kharitonov's polynomials (four fixed Bezier curves). Finally, the required interval control points are obtained from the fixed control points of the four fixed Kharitonov's polynomials. Subdividing a parametric interval Bezier curve into two interval segments is also presented. The two interval segments have the same shape as the <b>original</b> <b>interval</b> Bezier curve, but they are defined by more entities (interval control points or interval vectors) thereby making it possible to fine-tune the interval Bezier curve.
