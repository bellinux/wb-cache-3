In April 2017, she made her musical theatre debut in the Australian production of The Bodyguard, {{which is based on}} Whitney Houston's 1992 film of the same name. Paulini plays the lead role of Rachel Marron—originally portrayed by Houston in the film—a fictional pop superstar who is stalked by a fan and falls in love with her bodyguard. Paulini took acting lessons and increased her fitness to prepare for the role, which included singing and running <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>treadmill</b> at the same time. The Bodyguard musical is playing shows in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne from April until October 2017. Paulini's performance in the musical has been well-received by critics and audiences.|$|E

60|$|It may {{be worth}} inquiring where I {{should have gone to}}. I should say that {{practically}} every time I should have gone to a much more educational place. I should have gone into the country, or into the sea, or into the National Gallery, or to hear a band if there was one, or to any library where there were no schoolbooks. I should have read very dry and difficult books: for example, though nothing would have induced me to read the budget of stupid party lies that served as a text-book of history in school, I remember reading Robertson's Charles V. and his history of Scotland from end to end most laboriously. Once, stung by the airs of a schoolfellow who alleged that he had read Locke On The Human Understanding, I attempted to read the Bible straight through, and actually got to the Pauline Epistles before I broke down in disgust at what seemed to me their inveterate crookedness of mind. If there had been a school where children were really free, I should have had to be driven out of it for the sake of my health by the teachers; for the children to whom a literary education can be of any use are insatiable: they will read and study far more than is good for them. In fact the real difficulty is to prevent them from wasting their time by reading for the sake of reading and studying for the sake of studying, instead of taking some trouble {{to find out what they}} really like and are capable of doing some good at. Some silly person will probably interrupt me here with the remark that many children have no appetite for a literary education at all, and would never open a book if they were not forced to. I have known many such persons who have been forced to the point of obtaining University degrees. And for all the effect their literary exercises has left on them they might just as well have been put <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>treadmill.</b> In fact they are actually less literate than the treadmill would have left them; for they might by chance have picked up and dipped into a volume of Shakespear or a translation of Homer if they had not been driven to loathe every famous name in literature. I should probably know as much Latin as French, if Latin had not been made the excuse for my school imprisonment and degradation.|$|E
6000|$|Heavens, how stale and distasteful {{his former}} pursuits and friendships {{appeared}} to him! He had not been, {{up to the}} present time, much accustomed to the society of females of his own rank in life. When he spoke of such, he called them [...] "modest women." [...] That virtue which, let us hope, they possessed, had not hitherto compensated to Mr. Foker for the absence of more lively qualities which most of his own relatives did not enjoy, and which he found in Mesdemoiselles, the ladies of the theatre. His mother, though good and tender, did not amuse her boy; his cousins, the daughters of his maternal uncle, the respectable Earl of Rosherville, wearied him beyond measure. One was blue, and a geologist; one was a horsewoman, and smoked cigars; one was exceedingly Low Church, and had the most heterodox views on religious matters; at least, so the other said, who was herself of the very Highest Church faction, and made the cupboard in her room into an oratory, and fasted on every Friday in the year. Their paternal house of Drummington, Foker could very seldom be got to visit. He swore he had rather go <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>treadmill</b> than stay there. He was not much beloved by the inhabitants. Lord Erith, Lord Rosherville's heir, considered his cousin a low person, of deplorably vulgar habits and manners; while Foker, and with equal reason, voted Erith a prig and a dullard, the nightcap of the House of Commons, the Speaker's opprobrium, the dreariest of philanthropic spouters. Nor could George Robert, Earl of Gravesend and Rosherville, ever forget that on one evening when he condescended to play at billiards with his nephew, that young gentleman poked his lordship in the side with his cue, and said, [...] "Well, old cock, I've seen many a bad stroke in my life, but I never saw such a bad one as that there." [...] He played the game out with angelic sweetness of temper, for Harry was his guest as well as his nephew; but he was nearly having a fit in the night; and he kept to his own rooms until young Harry quitted Drummington on his return to Oxbridge, where the interesting youth was finishing his education at the time when the occurrence took place. It was an awful blow to the venerable earl; the circumstance was never alluded to in the family; he shunned Foker whenever he came to see them in London or in the country, and could hardly be brought to gasp out a [...] "How d'ye do?" [...] to the young blasphemer. But he would not break his sister Agnes's heart, by banishing Harry from the family altogether; nor, indeed, could he afford to break with Mr. Foker, senior, between whom and his lordship there had been many private transactions, producing an exchange of bank-cheques from Mr. Foker, and autographs from the earl himself, with the letters I O U written over his illustrious signature.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Recent {{studies have}} {{confirmed}} that regular tread-mill training can improve walking capabilities in incomplete spinal cord-injured subjects. At {{the beginning of this}} training the leg movements of the patients have to be assisted by phys-iotherapists during gait <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moving <b>treadmill.</b> <b>The</b> physical capabilities and the individual experience of the therapists usu-ally limit this training. A driven gait orthosis (DGO) has been developed that can move the legs of a patient in a physiologi-cal way <b>on</b> <b>the</b> moving <b>treadmill.</b> <b>The</b> orthosis is adjustable in size so different patients can use it. Actuators at the knee and hip joints are controlled by a position controller. With the DGO the legs of patients with different degrees of paresis and spas-ticity could be trained for more than half an hour, and physio-logical gait patterns were obtained.

40|$|Conventionally {{motorized}} treadmills elicit different sprinting kinematics to <b>the</b> over-ground condition. <b>Treadmills</b> {{powered by}} a torque motor {{have been used to}} assess sprinting power; yet, the kinematics of sprinting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> torque <b>treadmill</b> are unknown. This study compares the sprinting kinematics, during the constant velocity phase, between a conventional treadmill, a torque <b>treadmill</b> and <b>the</b> over-ground condition to assess the suitability of each treadmill for sprinting studies and training. After familiarization, 13 recreationally active males performed multiple sprints at various experimental settings on each surface. Ninety sprints, which attained mean velocities over 7. 0 m/s, had their lower-body sagittal plane joint angles during ground contact captured at 250 Hz. These data were low-pass filtered at 10 Hz, and compared with respect to surface, subject and velocity using an ANCOVA statistical model. Sprinting <b>on</b> <b>the</b> conventional <b>treadmill</b> elicited a longer ground contact time, a longer braking phase, a more extended knee at foot strike and a faster extending hip than <b>the</b> torque <b>treadmill</b> and over-ground (all P< 0. 05). <b>The</b> torque <b>treadmill</b> obtained an equivalent sprinting technique to the over-ground condition, {{with the exception of a}} less extended hip at toe-off, suggesting that it is more appropriate for laboratory sprinting analyses and training than <b>the</b> conventional <b>treadmill...</b>|$|R
