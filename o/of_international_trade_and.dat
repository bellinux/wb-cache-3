5|$|Other major {{employers}} {{in the county}} include: BAE Systems, Sunseeker International, J.P. Morgan, Cobham plc and Bournemouth University. Dorset's three ports, Poole, Weymouth and Portland, and the smaller harbours of Christchurch, Swanage, Lyme Regis, Wareham and West Bay generate a substantial amount <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>trade</b> <b>and</b> tourism. Around 230 fishing vessels that predominantly catch crab and lobster are based in Dorset's ports. When the waters around Weymouth and Portland were chosen for the sailing events in the 2012 Summer Olympic Games, the area underwent an increased investment in infrastructure and a growth in the marine leisure sector. It is expected that this {{will continue to have}} a positive effect on local businesses and tourism.|$|E

After containerization, large crews of longshoremen were no longer necessary at port facilities, and the profession changed drastically.|$|E

25|$|Japan v. Fairchild: In {{the early}} 1960s, both Fairchild and Texas Instruments {{tried to set}} up IC {{production}} in Japan, but were opposed by the Japan Ministry <b>of</b> <b>International</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>and</b> Industry (MITI). In 1962, MITI banned Fairchild from further investments in the factory that they already purchased in Japan, and Noyce tried to enter the Japanese market through the corporation NEC. In 1963, the management of NEC pushed Fairchild to extremely advantageous for Japan licensing terms, strongly limiting the Fairchild sales in the Japanese market. Only after concluding the deal Noyce learned {{that the president of}} NEC also chaired the MITI committee that blocked the Fairchild deals.|$|E
25|$|After the war Idemitsu Kosan {{lost its}} {{overseas}} {{trade with the}} Allied occupation of Japan. It was among the ten petroleum suppliers selected by the Ministry <b>of</b> <b>International</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>and</b> Industry (MITI) and cut its ties with Nippon Oil. Idemitsu began importing naphtha (an intermediate oil product) first from the United States and later from Venezuela and Iran. The protectionist Oil Industry Law helped Idemitsu against foreign competition in Japan, but also made owning its own refineries important. Idemitsu's first Tokuyama Refinery opened in 1957. This {{was followed by the}} Chiba oil refinery in 1963, Hyogo oil refinery in 1970, the Hokkaido oil refinery in 1973, and the Aichi oil refinery in 1975.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} Panama Canal has {{a limited}} capacity determined by operational times and cycles {{of the existing}} locks and further constrained by the current trend towards larger (close to Panamax-sized) vessels transiting the canal, requiring more transit time in the locks and channels. Also, periodic maintenance on the aging canal requires shutdowns of this waterway. Demand is growing due to the growth <b>of</b> <b>international</b> <b>trade,</b> <b>and</b> many users require a guaranteed level of service. Despite the gains which {{have been made in}} efficiency, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) estimated that the canal would reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012. The long-term solution for the congestion was the expansion of the canal with a third set of locks.|$|E
