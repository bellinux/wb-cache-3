5|$|A {{particular}} {{thorn in}} the side of the Scottish Crown at the turn of the thirteenth century was Haraldr Maddaðarson, Earl of Orkney and Caithness (died 1206). At some point in the last half of the twelfth century, Haraldr put aside his first wife, a daughter of an Earl of Fife, and married Hvarflǫð, a daughter of an Earl of Ross. The latter woman was a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powerful</b> meic Áedha, a northern kindred who had been in open conflict with the Scottish Crown throughout the twelfth century. Previous Orcadian earls had extended influence into Ross, and it may well have been through Hvarflǫð, and the claims to the earldom that she passed to their children, that drew Haraldr into conflict with the Scots.|$|E
5|$|According to a {{royal decree}} of 1428, Louis I had also ordered that only Catholics be granted {{land in the}} Sebeş {{district}} of Timiş county. As a result of official pressure, many Romanian noblemen converted to Catholicism. For example, the members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powerful</b> Drágffy family turned Catholic in the 15thcentury. The Ottomans raided Transylvania {{for the first time}} in 1394.

5|$|Alternatively, recent {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} seals of Neferhotep's brother Sobekhotep IV in proximity with seals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powerful</b> Hyksos king Khyan of the 15th Dynasty (c.16501550 BC) {{in a closed}} archaeological context, possibly indicating that the two were contemporary. If this is so, Neferhotep I would have been contemporary with either Khyan {{or one of his}} predecessors, such as Sakir-Har, and would not have reigned over the Nile Delta. This conclusion is strongly debated at the moment since Sobekhotep IV and Khyan are separated by c. 100 years in the conventional Egyptian chronology.|$|E

5|$|During the 15th and 16th centuries Framlingham was at {{the heart}} of the estates <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powerful</b> Mowbray and Howard families. Two {{artificial}} meres were built around the castle, which was expanded in fashionable brick. With a large, wealthy household to maintain, the castle purchased supplies from across England and brought in luxury goods from international markets. Extensive pleasure gardens were built within the castle and older parts redesigned to allow visitors to enjoy the resulting views. By the end of the 16th century, however, the castle fell into disrepair and after the final Howard owner, Theophilus, entered into financial difficulties the castle and the surrounding estates were sold off.|$|E

5|$|During {{the siege}} of Amphipolis, the Chalkidian League, led by Olynthos, began to fear Philip's {{territorial}} ambitions (since Amphipolis also controlled access to Chalkidiki), and therefore sought to ally with Athens against him. However, the Athenians still hoped to receive Amphipolis from Philip and so refused. Philip himself feared an alliance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powerful</b> Chalkidian League and Athens, so he moved to reassure the Olynthians by offering them an alliance on very advantageous terms. As part of the agreement with Olynthos, Philip was to capture the city of Potidea, located in {{the territory of the}} Chalkidian League. Potidea was at that time under the control of Athens, and represented a threat to the stability of the league.|$|E
5|$|Following the rebels' rout at Deir al-Ghusun on 14 July, Ibrahim Pasha's troops {{proceeded}} to Nablus unhindered, passing through Arraba, the loyalist stronghold of the Abd al-Hadi family, {{and then through}} Sanur, the throne village of the Jarrar clan. When they entered Nablus on 15 July, no resistance was put up, and shortly afterward, the rest of Jabal Nablus submitted to Muhammad Ali's troops. For the most part, due to the loyalty of the Abd al-Hadi's to Muhammad Ali, and the neutrality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powerful</b> Nimr clan, {{the inhabitants of the}} city of Nablus had not participated in the revolt. From Nablus, Ibrahim Pasha dispatched his troops north to occupy Jenin and Nazareth, before arriving in Jerusalem on 20 July with 30,000 new conscripts.|$|E
5|$|Goodrich Castle was {{probably}} built by Godric of Mappestone after the Norman invasion of England, initially as an earth and wooden fortification. In {{the middle of}} the 12th century the original castle was replaced with a stone keep, and was then expanded significantly during the late 13th century into a concentric structure combining luxurious living quarters with extensive defences. The success of Goodrich's design influenced many other constructions across England over the following years. It became the seat <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>powerful</b> Talbot family before falling out of favour as a residence in late Tudor times.|$|E
