5|$|About 19hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning from Apalachicola to Venice, Florida, which was preceded by {{a tropical storm}} watch six hours prior. As the storm intensified further, the NHC issued a hurricane warning from Apalachicola to Anclote Key, and extended the tropical storm warning westward to Fort Walton Beach. The agency later issued a tropical storm warning for the Atlantic coast from Cape Canaveral to Little River Inlet in South Carolina. Officials ordered evacuations for barrier islands in nine Florida counties along the gulf coast, and about 3,000people stayed in shelters. Government offices closed along the storm's projected path in the state. Later, the storm forced the cancellation of part of Bob Dole's bus tour through New York, and postponed {{a search for the}} wreck <b>of</b> <b>TWA</b> Flight 800. Game one of the 1996 World Series was postponed by one day due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bromine is toxic {{and causes}} {{chemical}} burns on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure {{may lead to}} frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds. Caution is required when transporting bromine; it is commonly carried in steel tanks lined with lead, supported by strong metal frames. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States has set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for bromine at a time-weighted average (TWA) of 0.1ppm. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) <b>of</b> <b>TWA</b> 0.1ppm and a short-term limit of 0.3ppm. The exposure to bromine immediately dangerous to life and health (IDLH) is 3ppm. Bromine is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Hughes {{placed an}} order for 63 Convair 880s for TWA {{at a cost of}} $400million. Although Hughes was {{extremely}} wealthy at this time, outside creditors demanded that Hughes relinquish control <b>of</b> <b>TWA</b> in return for providing the money. In 1960, Hughes was ultimately forced out <b>of</b> <b>TWA,</b> although he owned 78% of the company and battled to regain control.|$|E

25|$|The crash <b>of</b> <b>TWA</b> Flight 800, {{and that}} of ValuJet Flight 592 earlier in 1996, {{prompted}} Congress to pass the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996 {{as part of the}} federal aviation appropriations bill. Among other things, the Act gives NTSB, instead of the particular airline involved, responsibility for coordinating services to the families of victims of fatal aircraft accidents in the United States. In addition, it restricts lawyers and other parties from contacting family members within 30 days of the accident.|$|E
25|$|As the {{investigation}} progressed, the NTSB decided {{to form a}} witness group to more fully address the accounts of witnesses. From November 1996 through April 1997 this group reviewed summaries of witness accounts on loan from the FBI (with personal information redacted), and conducted interviews with crewmembers from a New York Air National Guard HH-60 helicopter and C-130 airplane, {{as well as a}} U.S. Navy P-3 airplane that was flying in the vicinity <b>of</b> <b>TWA</b> 800 {{at the time of the}} accident.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} {{explanation for}} the explosion and subsequent crash <b>of</b> <b>TWA</b> Flight 800 is that an explosive fuel/air mixture was created {{in one of the}} aircraft's fuel tanks. Faulty wiring then provided an ignition source within the tank, destroying the airliner. While the accuracy of the official findings is still questioned in this case, similar explosions have occurred in other aircraft. It is possible to reduce the chance of fuel tank explosions by a fuel tank inerting system or fire fighting foam in the tanks.|$|E
25|$|Donald Douglas was {{initially}} reluctant {{to participate in}} the invitation from TWA. He doubted {{that there would be a}} market for 100 aircraft, the number of sales necessary to cover development costs. Nevertheless, he submitted a design consisting of an all-metal, low-wing, twin-engined aircraft seating 12 passengers, a crew of two and a flight attendant. The aircraft exceeded the specifications <b>of</b> <b>TWA</b> even with only two engines, principally through the use of controllable pitch propellers. It was insulated against noise, heated, and fully capable of both flying and performing a controlled takeoff or landing on one engine.|$|E
25|$|A {{review of}} {{recorded}} data from long-range and airport surveillance radars revealed multiple contacts of airplanes or objects in TWA800's vicinity {{at the time}} of the accident. None of these contacts intersected TWA 800's position at any time. Attention was drawn to data from the Islip, New York, ARTCC facility that showed three tracks in the vicinity <b>of</b> <b>TWA</b> 800 that did not appear in any of the other radar data. None of these sequences intersected TWA 800's position at any time either. All the reviewed radar data showed no radar returns consistent with a missile or other projectile traveling toward TWA 800.|$|E

25|$|The NTSB was {{notified}} about 8:50pm {{the day of}} the accident; a full go-team was assembled in Washington, D.C. and arrived on scene early the next morning. Meanwhile, initial witness descriptions led many to believe the cause of the crash was a bomb or surface-to-air missile attack. The NTSB does not investigate criminal activity. The Attorney General is empowered to declare an investigation to be linked to a criminal act, and require the NTSB to relinquish control of the investigation to the FBI. In the case <b>of</b> <b>TWA</b> 800, the FBI initiated a parallel criminal investigation alongside the NTSB's accident investigation.|$|E
25|$|The ground-maintenance crew {{locked out}} the thrust {{reverser}} for engine #3 (treated as a {{minimum equipment list}} item) because of technical problems with the thrust reverser sensors during the landing <b>of</b> <b>TWA</b> 881 at JFK, prior to Flight 800's departure. Additionally, severed cables for the engine #3 thrust reverser were replaced. During refueling of the aircraft, the volumetric shutoff (VSO) control was {{believed to have been}} triggered before the tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the automatic VSO by pulling the volumetric fuse and an overflow circuit breaker. Maintenance records indicate that the airplane had numerous VSO-related maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident.|$|E
25|$|December 21, 1978 TWA Flight 541 from Louisville International Airport to Kansas City was hijacked by 17-year-old Robin Oswald to Williamson County Regional Airport in Illinois in {{attempt to}} secure the release of Garrett Brock Trapnell, who was serving time at United States Penitentiary, Marion for the January 28, 1972, {{hijacking}} <b>of</b> <b>TWA</b> Flight 2 from Los Angeles to New York City. Oswald's mother Barbara Oswald was killed May 24, 1978, after hijacking a helicopter {{in an attempt to}} rescue him (and Martin J. McNally, who was serving time for the June 23, 1972, hijacking of a St. Louis-Tulsa American Airlines flight). Robin surrendered after 10 hours at the Williamson airport.|$|E
