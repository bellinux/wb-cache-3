5|$|Particularly {{within the}} Labour Party there was {{disagreement}} {{about whether or}} not to build the Hardanger Bridge. In addition to crossing the Hardangerfjord, there were concerns that the bridge would increase the traffic through Hardangervidda National Park, and that it subsequently would result in an all-year road being built with subsequent negative impact <b>on</b> <b>nature</b> and wildlife. Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland of the Labour Party stated on 10 October 1995 that the government was in favor of the Triangle Link and opposed to the Hardanger Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Rimsky-Korsakov's {{interest}} in pantheism was whetted by the folkloristic studies of Alexander Afanasyev. That author's standard work, The Poetic Outlook <b>on</b> <b>Nature</b> by the Slavs, became Rimsky-Korsakov's pantheistic bible. The composer first applied Afanasyev's ideas in May Night, {{in which he}} helped fill out Gogol's story by using folk dances and calendar songs. He went further down this path in The Snow Maiden, where he made extensive use of seasonal calendar songs and khorovodi (ceremonial dances) in the folk tradition.|$|E
5|$|Smart's {{two most}} widely known works are A Song to David and Jubilate Agno, both {{at least partly}} written during his {{confinement}} in asylum. However, Jubilate Agno was not published until 1939 and A Song to David received mixed reviews until the 19th century. To his contemporaries, Smart was known mainly for his many contributions in the journals The Midwife and The Student, along with his famous Seaton Prize poems and his mock epic The Hilliad. Although he is primarily recognised as a religious poet, his poetry includes various other themes, such as his theories <b>on</b> <b>nature</b> and his promotion of English nationalism.|$|E

5|$|More {{accelerated}} {{classes were}} added, but {{the core of}} the gifted curriculum remained the individualized approaches and learning by doing that had long been central to the Avery Coonley curriculum. Nature study was still prominent in the student's activities, with music, art, and drama. The traditional learning themes and school projects involving maple trees, Native Americans, ancient Egypt and other topics were preserved but adapted to serve the gifted curriculum. In early 1980, an early childhood (EC) program for three-year-olds was launched, designed to cater to the needs of gifted preschool children and prepare them to transition from home to kindergarten. Again departing from the prevailing educational theory, Avery Coonley introduced academics in the EC program, with the same focus <b>on</b> <b>nature,</b> music, movement, and practical skills as the higher grades.|$|E

25|$|Empedocles is {{considered}} the last Greek philosopher to write in verse and the surviving fragments of his teaching are from two poems, Purifications and <b>On</b> <b>Nature.</b> Empedocles was undoubtedly acquainted with the didactic poems of Xenophanes and Parmenides– allusions to the latter {{can be found in}} the fragments,– but he seems to have surpassed them in the animation and richness of his style, and in the clearness of his descriptions and diction. Aristotle called him the father of rhetoric, and, although he acknowledged only the meter as a point of comparison between the poems of Empedocles and the epics of Homer, he described Empedocles as Homeric and powerful in his diction. Lucretius speaks of him with enthusiasm, and evidently viewed him as his model. The two poems together comprised 5000 lines. About 550 lines of his poetry survive, although because ancient writers rarely mentioned which poem they were quoting, it is not always certain to which poem the quotes belong. Some scholars now believe that there was only one poem, and that the Purifications merely formed the beginning of <b>On</b> <b>Nature.</b>|$|E
25|$|Crickets are {{a common}} subject of children's books <b>on</b> <b>nature</b> and advice on keeping pet crickets are plentiful. An ideal home habitat for a cricket is a large {{transparent}} jar or a small terrarium {{with at least two}} inches of damp soil on the bottom. There must be plenty of shelter where the crickets can hide; children's books and industrial breeders recommend egg-crate shells. The top of the terrarium must be tightly covered with a lid or nylon mesh.|$|E

Because Wright's design was based <b>on</b> <b>nature,</b> and everything in nature is at a 30/60-degree angle, the only 90 degree angles in the theater are where the walls meet the ceiling and floor.|$|E

25|$|Wicca is a neo-pagan {{religion}} focused <b>on</b> <b>nature,</b> {{guided by}} the philosophy of Wiccan Rede that advocates Harm None, Do As Ye Will. The concept of karmic return in Wicca states that our deeds return to us threefold, or multiple times to teach us lessons (The Threefold Law), whether in this lifetime or the next. Reincarnation therefore is an accepted part of the Wiccan faith. Wiccans also believe in death and afterlife as important experiences for the soul to transform and prepare for future lifetimes.|$|E
25|$|Canadian {{literature}} is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which {{are rooted in}} the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. Canada’s early literature, whether written in English or French, often reflects the Canadian perspective <b>on</b> <b>nature,</b> frontier life, and Canada’s position in the world, for example the poetry of Bliss Carman or the memoirs of Susanna Moodie and Catherine Parr Traill. These themes, and Canada's literary history, inform the writing of successive generations of Canadian authors, from Leonard Cohen to Margaret Atwood.|$|E
