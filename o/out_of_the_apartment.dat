40|$|Studies on {{rent control}} have {{generally}} failed to elicit attitudes and reactions of landlords to rent control ordinances. This analysis attempts {{to fill the}} gap by querying 1357 landlords in San Diego County, an area currently without rent control. As expected, almost all the landlords were opposed to rent control. The landlords were asked if actual rent control enactment would impact their investment plans and, if so, how. They also were asked if <b>the</b> current threat <b>of</b> rent control is having an impact on their investment plans and, if so, how. <b>The</b> vast majority <b>of</b> landlords responded to both of these questions in the affirmative. The various answers on type of reaction center around two themes: getting <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>apartments</b> business and a cessation of any further investment in apartments.
