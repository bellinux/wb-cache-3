His next book, Home Game: Hockey and Life in Canada (1990), written with Roy MacGregor, was developed into an award-winning Canadian Broadcasting Corporation six-part documentary series for television. His fourth book was The moved and the shaken: The story of one man's life (1993). His fifth book, In School: Our Kids, Our Teachers, <b>Our</b> <b>Classrooms</b> (1995), written with Roy MacGregor, was about Canada’s educational system.

We had heard Khan's TED talk and {{were aware of the}} concept of inverted pedagogies in general. Yet, it really hit home when we accidentally flipped <b>our</b> <b>classroom.</b> <b>Our</b> objective was to better prepare our students for class. We set out to effectively move some of our course content outside of class and decided to tweak the Just-in-Time-Teaching approach (JiTT). To our surprise, this tweak - which we like to call the flip-JiTT - ended up completely flipping <b>our</b> <b>classroom.</b> What follows is narrative of our experience and a procedure that any teacher can use to extend JiTT to a flipped classroom.

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{back to our}} daily lives, from the minute boys enter <b>our</b> <b>classrooms,</b> {{masculine}} identity building {{is taking place in}} one form or another. At some level, teachers and students, both male and female, often act in accordance with a set of unspoken tenets that are subtly or explicitly reinforced through tacit approval, willing indifference, or a lack of awareness. William Pollack (as cited in Neu & Weinfeld, 2007) calls this set of culturally embedded expectations about masculinity the Boy Code. An examination of this [...] "code" [...] yields new insights about the troublesome behaviors exhibited by many struggling boys in <b>our</b> <b>classrooms</b> and reveals why boys with certain styles (SF/Interpersonal and NF/Self-Expressive, specifically) might experience its negative impact more deeply than their peers.|$|E

They were 2 ̆ 2 paid 2 ̆ 2 for some of these responsibilities and were responsible for managing their earnings to pay rent, fines, or purchase rewards. To assess what students learned, I implemented three assessments, photographed materials, and recorded field notes.

40|$|This {{inquiry is}} a {{collaborative}} {{study of the}} benefits of integrating cooperative learning into the classroom. Specifically, we attempt to answer the following questions: 1) How can we effectively integrate cooperative learning into the classroom? 2) In what ways will cooperative learning benefit the students in <b>our</b> <b>classroom?</b> In <b>our</b> inquiry, we discuss the three types of cooperative learning: partner work, group work, and whole class collaboration, which we implemented in the classroom. We used lesson, plans, field notes, reflections, photographs, student work, and literature to support our inquiry. We analyzed our data to determine the benefits as well as limitations of using cooperative learning in the classroom.
