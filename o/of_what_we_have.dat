Her overall impression of the country was of drabness and oppression, with welfare provision generally well below British levels, although she conceded that medical facilities were excellent.

500|$|Widmerpool's egotism and will-power enable him, once set, {{to carry}} all before him, {{although}} before his ultimate downfall his powers develop in somewhat sinister directions. [...] In {{a review of}} the early novels in the sequence, Arthur Mizener wrote: [...] "Powell makes his great egoists, for all their absurdity, something not essentially different from all the rest of us; even Widmerpool, the most extravagant of the lot, is not. However sublimely ridiculous he becomes, he continues to remind us, not so much, perhaps, <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> done, as what we have, in our time, known we might do".|$|E

This time we've made 20-plus songs, and we'll put the best <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> on there, whatever the numbers end up being. We have so many to choose from, I think it's {{going to be a}} little extra special this time." [...] Munky later confirmed this by saying that the band completed 25 songs and 15 of them would be put on the album. Head later elaborated that musically this was Korn's best album.|$|E

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the report [...] "further corroboration <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> already known, that Hezbollah and its Iranian patrons are orchestrating a worldwide campaign of terror that is spanning countries and continents." [...] Netanyahu said that the attack in Bulgaria was just one of many that Hezbollah and Iran have planned and carried out, including attacks in Thailand, Kenya, Turkey, India, Azerbaijan, Cyprus and Georgia.|$|E

He said that Obama's position on moral issues regarding life and the family had crossed that line.

[...] The show {{went on to win the}} award, on which Yorke stated, [...] "To win such a prestigious award is a huge honour for all the team—and proof that the EastEnders brand is as brave and innovatory as it was when it first started, a quarter of a century ago."

Their manifesto of April 26 (April 13), reviewed for publishing by the Transylvanian poet Octavian Goga, was signed by 250 officers and 250 soldiers, and is probably the first unionist statement to be issued by a Transylvanian representative body. The document states: [...] "we Romanians, like all other subjugated nations, have grown aware that {{once and for all}} that we [...] cannot carry on with our lives within the frame of the Austro-Hungarian state; we [...] demand, with unwavering will, our incorporation into Romania, so that together we may form a single national Romanian state. [...] For the sake of this ideal, we throw in the balance all <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> our lives and fortunes, our women and children, our descendants' life and happiness.

500|$|After {{less than}} five years as a judge, Denning was {{appointed}} a Lord Justice of Appeal on 14 October 1948. He was sworn in as a Privy Counsellor on 25 October 1948. As a Lord Justice of Appeal he continued to make reforming judgments in a variety of areas, particularly in family law and the rights of deserted wives. In 1952 the Court of Appeal heard Bendall v McWhirter [...] 2 QB 466 and ruled that a deserted wife occupying the marital home had a personal licence to stay there. The decision provoked disapproval among the judiciary and from the public; a correspondent wrote: Dear Sir: You are a disgrace to all mankind to let these women break up homes and expect us chaps to keep them while they rob us <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> worked for and put us out on the street. I only hope you have the same trouble as us. So do us all a favour and take a Rolls and run off Beachy Head and don't come back.|$|E
500|$|The episode's humour {{was praised}} by the {{majority}} of commentators. Julia Raeside, writing for The Guardian, said the writers [...] "managed to pull together a loving tribute to [...] cult horror source material with an all-out gag rate that most sitcoms would fail to keep up with", claiming that [...] "they get the look and tone just right and then inject it with the kind of comedy that is perfectly tailored to puncture the fictional world without deflating it". Similarly, Debnath felt that the jokes, including [...] "anachronistic references" [...] and [...] "dark punnery", were [...] "bang on". By contrast, Hawksley claimed that the episode had several [...] "inspired moments", including a [...] "perfectly pitched" [...] joke about selfies, but that the writers had failed to properly exploit the 17th-century setting. Overall, though finding it [...] "occasionally funny", Hawksley thought the episode [...] "fell some way short <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> come to expect from Pemberton and Shearsmith". For the comedy critic Bruce Dessau, the episode was [...] "all the more hauntingly funny because it is played pretty straight", but he noted that the character of Sir Andrew Pike allowed [...] "some offbeat humour". Chater called the episode [...] "very, very funny", and Philip Cunnington, of the Lancashire Evening Post, called it [...] "one of the funniest half-hours of TV so far this year" [...] after the conclusion of the series.|$|E
500|$|Perot {{participated in}} the first of three presidential debates for the 1992 election, on October 11 in Clayton, Missouri, along with George Bush and Bill Clinton. It {{was the first time that}} a third party {{candidate}} was involved in a national televised debate since John B. Anderson in 1980, and was the first presidential debate to ever feature three candidates. During the event, Perot discussed a wide range of issues including the budget deficit, education and drug use, and proclaimed that as president, he would eliminate the influence of lobbyists. He also had a few memorable quips. When asked to address detractors' criticism of his lack of government experience, he remarked: [...] "Well, they've got a point. I don't have any experience running up a $4 trillion debt." [...] When discussing what would happen if one of his opponents won, he commented: [...] "then they will have heard the harsh reality <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to do. I'm not playing Lawrence Welk music here tonight." [...] After the debate, three out of four polls declared Perot as the winner. The average of all four showed Perot at 37% followed by Clinton with 30% and Bush with 18%, but election polls still showed Perot in third with 14%, far behind both Bush and Clinton. His running mate, James Stockdale, participated in a Vice Presidential debate in Atlanta, with fellow Vice Presidential nominee Al Gore and Vice President Dan Quayle. Largely unknown to the general public, Stockdale memorably opened the debate by unexpectedly asking the philosophical question, [...] "Who am I? Why am I here?" [...] He was unprepared to deal with some of the substantive issues raised, and his struggling performance may have damaged the Perot campaign.|$|E

500|$|... "His Last Vow" [...] {{received}} critical acclaim, with Louisa Mellor of Den of Geek {{saying that}} the episode was [...] "as good a finale as Sherlock's ever had", with a very strong plot. Mark Jefferies of The Mirror called the episode [...] "easily the best yet in this run", with a [...] "fascinating" [...] plot. He also praised Mikkelsen as [...] "brilliant". Josh Wilding, also writing for The Mirror, said the episode [...] "was {{in many ways the}} best episode of Sherlock yet" [...] and called it [...] "simply one of the greatest TV shows of all-time", giving it 5/5. Caroline Frost of the Huffington Post called it a [...] "fitting finale to the series, with writers and actors all saving their best for last", despite the third series' [...] "patchy" [...] performances. Serana Davies of The Telegraph called the episode [...] "the best of the lot" [...] and gave 4 out of 5 stars, calling Moffat [...] "the superior Sherlock writer". Although her review was mainly positive, she questioned whether the programme had become [...] "a little vain, rather a show-off". Lucy Mangan of The Guardian said the episode was [...] "perfect", and a [...] "ceaseless flow of wit, invention and intelligence", a sentiment echoed by Ellen Jones of The Independent, who stated that it contained [...] "intelligence, humour and obscure fanboy references galore" [...] which [...] "delivered the goods". She went on to state that it is [...] "enough detail in this episode to justifying watching it again and again, once weekly, until series four". Chris Harvey of The Telegraph praised the [...] "beautifully done" [...] conclusion of the episode featuring Moriarty, saying it was [...] "very playful, very neat. And very unexpected". Sandipan Deb, writing in Indian newspaper Mint, was positive about the episode, calling it [...] "the best" [...] episode in the series, and praised its [...] "stunning twists and turns, its thrilling upending <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> known about the characters for a lifetime, an emotional depth not seen before, and its clever throwaway references to the Canon". Deb also praised the [...] "uber-cool cinematic technique", singling out the moment when Sherlock has been shot and falls to the floor as an [...] "extraordinary leap of the imagination and cinematic bravura". However, it was stated that the writers were [...] "influenced by the zoned-out Holmes films directed by Guy Ritchie".|$|E
