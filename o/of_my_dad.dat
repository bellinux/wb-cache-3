There will never be another like him," [...] Barham told The Shreveport Times.|$|E

Later on in the nursery all of us children were rather frightened of him, and we used to have great discussions as to where this uncle came from. The Christmas present theory was soon exploded, because of some difficulty about Uncle Arthur not having been actually found in a stocking, and his being too big anyway to be hidden in one, so we fell back on Jim's suggestion that he was the man in the moon come down for a holiday." ...|$|E

40|$|When I was {{six years}} old <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> told me he grew up in a {{religious}} cult called Wisdom Knowledge Faith Love Fountain of the World, where a man he called “the master” said he was the second coming of Christ- turns out he wasn’t. When <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> was twelve, two disgruntled members, blew up the building my grandparents and uncle were sleeping in and they died. I had a lot <b>of</b> questions, but <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> didn’t have many answers because he blocked much of the experience out – as many survivors of trauma do. This half-hour film documents my quest for the truth <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>dad’s</b> mysterious childhood. Why did my grandparents join a cult? How did <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> and uncle cope growing up barefoot with long braids in LA public schools during an era of crew cuts?

In order to tell the story I travel with <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> and uncle to the places of their childhood, all the time trying to get <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> to answer questions he couldn’t in the past. This story of a daughter probing into family history touches on the early days of a counter culture movement and the effects on one family involved. Even though I set out to understand my grandparents in the end I learned more about <b>my</b> <b>dad</b> and uncle’s survival as our relationship deepened through the filmmaking process...|$|R
