5|$|During {{the later}} Third Intermediate Period and later periods, {{intrusive}} burials were introduced into many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> tombs. In Coptic times, {{some of the}} tombs were used as churches, stables, and even houses.|$|E
5|$|However, the Cabildo {{appointed}} a Junta headed by Cisneros, who {{would stay in}} power, even if under a new office. Saavedra was appointed to this Junta, as well as Castelli and two peninsulars. They made the oath of office, but the Junta was received with strong popular unrest, as it was perceived as going contrary to the result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> cabildo. By the night, Saavedra and Castelli resigned, convincing Cisneros to do the same.|$|E

5|$|Prior to opening, {{the flower}} buds are enveloped and {{protected}} {{in a thin}} dry papery or membranous (scarious) spathe. The spathe consists of a singular bract that is ribbed, and which remains wrapped around the base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> flower. As the bud grows, the spathe splits longitudinally. Bracteoles are small or absent.|$|E
5|$|The Cabildo {{interpreted}} the decision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> cabildo {{in its own}} way. When it formed the new Junta to govern until the arrival of representatives from other cities, Leiva arranged for former viceroy Cisneros to be appointed president of the Junta and commander of the armed forces. There are many interpretations of his motives for departing from the decision <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> cabildo in this way. Four other members were appointed to the Junta: criollos Cornelio Saavedra and Juan José Castelli, and peninsulars Juan Nepomuceno Solá and José Santos Inchaurregui.|$|E

5|$|The {{end of the}} Johnson County War also {{marked the}} end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> range in Wyoming. By 1893, the WSGA was opened to the other small ranchers and farmers, finally ending their {{monopoly}} and control over Wyoming business interests. Previous practices of the WSGA, such as vigilantism and confiscation of cattle were finally stopped. Many prominent leaders of the Association such as Frank Wolcott, Frank M. Canton and Tom Smith later left the area.|$|E
5|$|The insect {{circulatory system}} {{utilizes}} hemolymph, a tissue analogous to blood that circulates {{in the interior}} of the insect body, while remaining in direct contact with the animal's tissues. It is composed of plasma in which hemocytes are suspended. In addition to hemocytes, the plasma also contains many chemicals. It is also the major tissue type <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> circulatory system of arthropods, characteristic of spiders, crustaceans and insects.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{branches}} {{of political parties}} on the council, including Communist, Islamist, and secular. The leftist factions of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and the Palestinian People's Party (PPP) usually dominate the reserved seats. Hamas gained the majority <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> seats in the 2005 Palestinian municipal elections.|$|E

5|$|Transparency is common, even dominant, {{in animals}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> sea, {{especially}} those that live in relatively shallow waters. It is found in plankton of many species, as well as larger animals such as jellyfish, salps (floating tunicates), and comb jellies.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, genes {{can have}} {{regulatory}} regions many kilobases upstream or downstream <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> reading frame that alter expression. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop {{so that the}} regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.|$|E
5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell into one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> construction sites nearby. This {{is widely regarded as}} unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate {{at the top of the}} stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E
5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, {{it has been suggested that}} this unique bill was used as a pincer, with the tips of both mandibles touching. The hookbill could have used this movement to pluck fruits or flowers for consumption, or it may have been used to extract snails from their shells. It is also possible that the bird could have crushed a snail shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>open</b> sides of the beak.|$|E
