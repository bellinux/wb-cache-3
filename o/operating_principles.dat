It {{was formed in}} 1925, and took on its modern form under the Radio New Zealand Act 1995. The broadcaster is bound by the Charter and <b>Operating</b> <b>Principles</b> included in the Act, which is reviewed by the New Zealand Parliament every five years and was last amended in 2004. The broadcaster is required to provoke debate and critical thought, reflect New Zealand and MƒÅori cultural diversity, cater for varied ages and interests, promote music and drama and {{create a sense of}} national identity. It is also a Civil Defence broadcaster.|$|E

500|$|The Vietnamese {{judicial}} system {{is based upon}} Socialist legality. The country's highest judicial organ is the Supreme People's Court (SPC). The composition of the SCP includes the Chief Justice, Deputy Chief Judge, jurors and court secretaries. The structure of the SCP (from the top down) is as follows: Council of Judges, Commission of Judges, Central Military Court, Criminal Court, Civil Court, Appeal Court, and assisting staff. The Chief Judge of the SCP is elected by the National Assembly, while the President of the Socialist Republic {{has the power to}} nominate and dismiss the Deputy Chief Judge and judges at the Chief Judge's request. The Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front introduces People's Jurors, which are in turn appointed by the Standing Committee of the National Assembly. According to the Government Web Portal, the <b>operating</b> <b>principles</b> of the courts are, during hearings, that the [...] "judges and jurors are independent and only obey the laws." [...] Justice and democracy within the system is supposedly ensured because legal decision-making is an open process. Jurors play an essential role, and defenders have the right of defence and to hire a lawyer.|$|E
500|$|In a {{detailed}} {{study published in}} 1987 of the tiger's musical and noise-making functions, Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume concluded that since coming to Britain, [...] "the instrument has been ruthlessly reworked, {{and in doing so}} much of its original <b>operating</b> <b>principles</b> have been destroyed". There are two ranks of pipes in the organ (as opposed to the wailing and grunting functions), each [...] "comprising eighteen notes, [...] are nominally of 4ft pitch and are unisons - i.e. corresponding pipes in each register make sounds of the same musical pitch. This is an unusual layout for a pipe organ although while selecting the two stops together results in more sound ... there is also detectable a slight beat between the pipes so creating a celeste effect. ... it is considered likely that as so much work has been done ... this characteristic may be more an accident of tuning than an intentional feature". The tiger's grunt is made by a single pipe in the tiger's head and the man's wail by a single pipe emerging at his mouth and connected to separate bellows located in the man's chest, where they can be accessed by unbolting and lifting off the tiger. The grunt operates by cogs gradually raising the weighted [...] "grunt-pipe" [...] until it reaches a point where it slips down [...] "to fall against its fixed lower-board or reservoir, discharging the air to form the grunting sound" [...] Today all the sound-making functions rely on the crank-handle to power them, though Ord-Hume believes this was not originally the case.|$|E

2500|$|The {{most common}} stove for heating in the {{industrial}} world for almost {{a century and a}} half was the coal stove that burned coal. [...] Coal stoves came in all sizes and shapes and different <b>operating</b> <b>principles.</b> [...] Coal burns at a much higher temperature than wood, and coal stoves must be constructed to withstand the high heat levels. [...] A coal stove can burn either wood or coal, but a wood stove cannot burn coal unless a grate is supplied. The grate may be removable or an [...] "extra".|$|E
2500|$|In 1937-1938, Tolnai {{had several}} {{temporary}} assignments {{for the army}} administration in Sweden, which exploited his patents for, among others, including driving relay, an electrically operated switch, which then became part of his construction of the Central Instrument (key instrument). Many relays use an electromagnet to operate a switching mechanism mechanically, but other <b>operating</b> <b>principles</b> are also used. The structure is used to measure one or more physical quantities. In terms of the basic physical tasks required, a driver {{must be able to}} control direction, acceleration, and deceleration. A latching relay has two relaxed states (bistable). These are also called [...] "impulse", [...] "keep", or [...] "stay" [...] relays.|$|E

2500|$|The HK45 {{represents}} an evolutionary {{advancement of the}} Heckler & Koch USP, and shares the same <b>operating</b> <b>principles</b> of that weapon. It {{is available in the}} same ten variants as the USP. The HK45 is a full size model pistol, but significant effort went towards making it more ergonomic than the HK USP full-size chambered in [...]45 ACP by incorporating features found on the Heckler & Koch P2000. These include an extended ambidextrous slide release, a textured ergonomic grip with finger grooves, and interchangeable backstraps to fit differently sized hands. The newer grip and backstraps allow the pistol to sit lower into the web of the hand, contributing to greater control of the weapon and recoil management. In order to accommodate the smaller, more ergonomic grip, the HK45 has a magazine capacity of 10 rounds versus 12 rounds for the USP45. The HK45 also added grip serrations on {{the front end of the}} slide, a Picatinny rail in front of the trigger guard for mounting accessories, and an O-ring polygonal barrel similar to the USP Expert and Match models and the Mark 23 for more consistent lock-up of the slide and barrel during cycling and increased accuracy.|$|E
