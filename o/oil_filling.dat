40|$|AIM:To {{evaluate}} anatomical {{and visual}} outcomes of episcleral macular buckling (EMB) for posterior retinal detachment in silicone <b>oil</b> <b>filled</b> eyes associated with myopic macular hole. METHODS: Five cases of EMB for initial failure of retinal reattachment after internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling and silicone oil tamponade caused by myopic macular hole were retrospectively reviewed. A silicone sponge sutured {{directly across the}} macular region {{was performed on the}} silicone <b>oil</b> <b>filled</b> eyes. Silicone <b>oil</b> was removed no sooner than 1 month post-EMB. The duration of follow-up time after removal of silicone oil was more than 3 months. RESULTS: Retinas of five eyes were all reattached at the last follow-up.

CONCLUSION: Anatomical results improved after EBM for posterior retinal detachment in silicone <b>oil</b> <b>filled</b> eyes associated with myopic macular hole, which was not evident for visual outcome...|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic damping is provided, as {{the leaf}} springs are {{immersed}} in oil. Any {{movement of the}} spring plates must squeeze oil through the narrow gaps around them between the plates and the casing. As the springs have a high surface area, yet {{there is only a}} small gap between them and their housing, the damping factor can be high. Damping can be adjusted completely independent from the coupling's torsional stiffness. The oil used for damping is usually supplied by the engine lubrication system, through a drilling in the crankshaft. If this is unavailable, an oil-filled coupling can be used. This <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> also aids lubrication and encourages a long service life.|$|E
50|$|Initially, the PW1000G {{start up}} {{sequence}} took about seven minutes, compared to {{one to two}} and a half minute startups on the similar CFM56 and IAE V2500 engines; hardware fixes and software upgrades decreased the time required by a little over a minute, and cooling down both engines at the same time saved slightly over two minutes, for a total reduction of three and a half minutes. This modifications were included on new-build engines, as well as retrofitting existing units.

50|$|The {{nuances of}} the SP log are still being researched. In theory, almost all porous rocks contain water. Some pores are {{completely}} filled with water. Others have {{a thin layer of}} water molecules wetting the surface of the rock, with gas or <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> the rest of the pore. In sandstones and porous limestones there is a continuous layer of water throughout the formation. If there is even a little permeability to water, ions can move through the rock and decrease the voltage difference with the mud nearby. Shales do not allow water or ion movement. Although they may have a large water content, it is bound {{to the surface of the}} flat clay crystals comprising the shale. Thus mud opposite shale sections maintains its voltage difference with the surrounding rock. As the SP logging tool is drawn up the hole it measures the voltage difference between the reference stake and the mud opposite shale and sandstone or limestone sections. The resulting log curve reflects the permeability of the rocks and, indirectly, their lithology. SP curves degrade over time, as the ions diffuse up and down the mud column. It also can suffer from stray voltages caused by other logging tools that are run with it. Older, simpler logs often have better SP curves than more modern logs for this reason. With experience in an area, a good SP curve can even allow a skilled interpreter to infer sedimentary environments such as deltas, point bars or offshore tidal deposits.|$|E
30|$|On the whole, the tracing {{results of}} the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> stages {{demonstrate}} a general <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> orientation from south to north in the Tuoputai region.

The location of the source kitchen/bed is in agreement with the findings of previous studies (e.g., Wang et al. 2008; Chang et al. 2013 b; Xiao et al. 2016; Fang et al. 2016).|$|E

30|$|The Markit Slope is an {{important}} area for the petroleum exploration in the Tarim Basin. Elucidation of the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> history of discovered oilfields has great significance for recognizing the accumulation processes of the whole region. Using molecular geochemistry, fluid inclusion techniques and basin modeling, we studied the <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> process of the Bashituo Oilfield that {{is located in the}} west of the Markit Slope. The molecular migration indexes, such as the methyldibenzothiophene ratio (4 -/ 1 -MDBT), trimethylnaphthalene ratio (TMNr) and pyrrolic nitrogen compounds content, decrease from west to east, indicating that the charging direction and migration pathways are from west to east. Lithological analysis and homogenization temperatures of saline fluid inclusions accompanied with oil fluid inclusions suggest that two charging periods occurred in the Devonian oil reservoir. Combining the burial history and heating history of well BT 4, Basinmod ID software modeling shows the two <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> periods are from 290 Ma to 285 Ma and from 10 Ma to 4 Ma, respectively, and later <b>oil</b> <b>filling</b> dominates.
