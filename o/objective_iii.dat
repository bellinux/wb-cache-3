40|$|M. Cur. The {{learning}} accompanists (nurse educator), in the didactic situation {{within the}} context of a nursing college, is midst a process of transformation. This transformation has a direct influence on the learning accompanists didactic role fulfilment. Didactic support systems enables the learning accompanist to fulfil her/his didactic role. These didactic support systems should be managed during the process of transformation, in such a way that it enables the learning accompanist to fulfil her/his didactic role. A new creative approach to the management of the didactic situation is necessary. The goal of this study is to describe guidelines for the management of didactic support systems, at a nursing college, to enable the learning accompanist to fulfil her/his didactic role. An inductive, qualitative, contextual, exploring, descriptive strategy is used to reach the goal of the study. The background and rationale of the study are described, the problem is stated as well as a central theoretical statement. The assumptions of the study are described within the framework of the nursing theory for the whole person. No explicit theoretical assumptions are made, so that the researcher is open to empirical findings and to prevent pre-conceived ideas. The methodological assumptions is based on the Botes research model. No explicit conceptual framework is used as point of departure. Because the participants are midst a process of transformation, their knowledge and experience are used as source of data, as they can express their needs and views the best. The goal of this study is reached by setting four objectives. Objective I is to explore and describe the learning accompanists need for didactic support systems, {{within the context}} of a nursing college. Objective II is to explore and describe the managements views with regard to the way they can give didactic support, {{within the context of}} a nursing college. <b>Objective</b> <b>III</b> is to describe a conceptual framework. Objective IV is derived from objective I, objective II and <b>objective</b> <b>III.</b> Objective IV is the description of guidelines for the management of didactic support systems at a nursing college. To attain objective I, exploring is done by means of interviews with learning accompanist's. One semi-structured question is: "What are your needs for didactic support systems in the college?" To attain objective II, exploring is done by means of individual interviews with role players. One central question is set: "How can you give didactic support to the learning accompanist?" The interviews are conducted by an independent moderator/interviewer and assistant. Data is recorded by means of audio tapes and field notes, whereafter transcription takes place. Data is coded by the researcher and an assistent coder. The data analysis is done through a systematic approach of text analysis, as described by Tesch (in Cresswell, 1995 : 155). Thereafter the empirical findings of objective I and objective II are described. The interpretations are grounded by statements from the empirical data. Statements (n = 57) are formulated from the empirical findings of objective I and objective II. From these statements (n = 57) a list of concepts are generated. These concepts are utilized to attain <b>objective</b> <b>III,</b> the describing of a conceptual framework. The survey list of Dickoff, James and Wiedenbach (1968) is utilized to describe the conceptual framework in a structured manner. Data collection is done through a literature search to correlate the empirical findings with the literature. During the description of the conceptual framework conclusion statements (n = 15) are made. These conclusion statements are utilized to attain objective IV. Objective IV is to describe guidelines for the management of didactic support systems at a nursing college. Through logical inferention 12 guidelines and possible operationalisation of each are described. The uniqueness of the study lies in the relevance within the current time frame context and that it expresses the needs of the learner accompanists and the views of the managers at a nursing college. An abundance of possibilities for further research are created...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of network}} Newton methods for the {{decentralized}} optimization of a sum cost distributed through agents {{of a network}} is considered. Network Newton methods reinterpret distributed gradient descent as a penalty method, observe that the corresponding Hessian is sparse, and approximate the Newton step by truncating a Taylor expansion of the inverse Hessian. Truncating the series at $K$ terms yields the NN-$K$ that requires aggregating information from $K$ hops away. Network Newton is introduced and shown to converge to {{the solution of the}} penalized objective function at a rate that is at least linear in a companion paper [3]. The contributions of this work are: (i) To complement the convergence analysis by studying the methods' rate of convergence. (ii) To introduce adaptive formulations that converge to the optimal argument of the original <b>objective.</b> (<b>iii)</b> To perform numerical evaluations of NN-$K$ methods. The convergence analysis relates the behavior of NN-$K$ with the behavior of (regular) Newton's method and shows that the method goes through a quadratic convergence phase in a specific interval. The length of this quadratic phase grows with $K$ and can be made arbitrarily large. The numerical experiments corroborate reductions in the number of iterations and the communication cost that are necessary to achieve convergence relative to distributed gradient descent.

Our study examined the following on INSL 3 peptide expression in ALC lineage (i) timing, (ii) which cell stage, and (iii) effects of triiodothyronine (T 3). Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats of postnatal days (pd) 1, 5, 7 - 21, 28, 40, 60, and 90 {{were used for the}} objectives (i) and (ii). For the <b>objective</b> (<b>iii),</b> control and T 3 -treated (daily T 3 SC, 50 mug/kg bw) SD rats of pd 7 - 16 and 21 were used. INSL 3 was immunolocalized in Bouin's-fixed testes. FLC were positive and mesenchymal and Leydig progenitor cells were negative for INSL 3 at tested ages. INSL 3 in ALC lineage was first detected in newly formed ALC on pd 16, although they were present from pd 10. The intensity of INSL 3 label was greater in ALC of pd 40 - 90. ALC were present in T 3 -treated testes at pd 9, but INSL 3 first detected in them was on pd 12. While INSL 3 in FLC regulates testicular descent, INSL 3 in ALC still has no well-defined function. However, its pattern of expression correlates temporally with the development of steroidogenic function and spermatogenesis. Thus, the delay between ALC differentiation and INSL 3 expression in them implies that INSL 3 in ALC is associated with maturation. The advancement of INSL 3 expression in the ALC of T 3 -treated rats implies that this function is established earlier with T 3 -treatment.

Alterations in these properties affect the heat and moisture exchanges between the land surface and atmospheric boundary layer. The objectives of this research were; (i) to quantitatively identify the High plains 2 ̆ 7 regional climate change in temperatures over the period 1895 to 2006, (ii) detect the signatures of anthropogenic forcing of LULC changes on the regional climate change of the High Plains, and (iii) examine the trends in evolving regional latent heat flux under the changing climate during the past thirty years. ^ We investigated the regional climate change by comparing two trend periods, the reference period (1895 – 1930) and the warming period (1971 – 2006), using the base period as 1935 – 1965. For the objective (ii) the study developed an enhanced signal processing procedure to maximize the {{signal to noise ratio}} by introducing a pre-filtering technique of ARMA modeling, before applying the optimal fingerprinting technique to detect the signals of LULC change. For the <b>objective</b> (<b>iii),</b> we estimated ETc using the widely accepted two-step approach. We developed a linear model to estimate spatial crop coefficient (K c) from AVHRR-based NDVI. The Kc estimates were used to adjust spatial ETo estimates, thereby yielding spatial ETc estimates that are representative of the summer latent heat fluxes of years 1981 to 2006. ^ The results from the study show that, the overall warming trend in the High Plains was about 0. 11 °C/decade. The minimum temperature had the strongest warming at a rate of 0. 19 °C/decade. Due to LULC changes attributed to increase in irrigation application and vegetation surfaces, more surface energy in summer is being redistributed into latent heat flux. Therefore, there is a significant influence of evaporative cooling on regional temperatures during summer season. As a result, the greenhouse warming effect in the region is being surpassed. ...|$|E

40|$|Discretization is an {{important}} tool to transfer optimization problems that include differentiations and integrals into standard optimization prob-lems with {{a finite number of}} variables and a finite number of constraints. Recently, Betts and Campbell proposed a heat-transfer optimization problem that includes the heat partial differential equation as one of its constraints, and the objective function includes integrals of the temperature function squared. Using discretization methods, this problem can be converted to a convex quadratic optimization problem, which can be solved by standard interior point method solvers in polynomial time. The discretized model of the one dimensional problem is further an-alyzed, and some of its variants are studied. Extensive numerical testing is performed to demonstrate the power of the “discretize then optimize”. Then the heat transfer optimization problem is generalized to two dimensions, and the discretized model and computational comparisons for this variant are in-cluded. Flexibility of discretization methods allow us to apply the same ”dis-cretize then optimize ” methodology to solve optimization problems that in-clude differential and integral functions as constraints or <b>objectives.</b> <b>iii</b> Acknowledgements I would like to express my sincere thanks to my supervisors, Dr. Tamás Terlaky and Dr. Nedialko Nedialkov.

40|$|Several {{processes}} {{have been}} suggested for the bioconversion of lactose from whey to other useful chemicals. However, these whey bioconversion processes can generate aqueous waste streams with a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) level because of their residual amounts of lactose and other metabolic by-products. There {{is a need for}} a simple treatment process that will reduce the pollution level of the fermented whey waste streams. This work investigates the production of yeast single-cell protein (YSCP) from these wastes. ^ The objectives were to: (i) define an appropriate mixed yeast culture, (ii) determine the model and parameters that describe the culture growth, and (iii) compare batch and continuous culture operating modes for the reduction of COD. ^ Objective (i) was achieved by identifying the mixed yeast culture consisting of Kluyveromyces marxianus and Candida utilis strains. The selection was based in higher growth rates, simultaneous utilization of lactose, lactic acid, glycerol and ethanol by the two yeasts, and faster COD reduction rates. There was no apparent interaction between the two species in the cultures. ^ Objective (ii) was completed by selecting the cybernetic model described by Kompala et al., (1986), and performing the individual substrate/yeast strain kinetics to determine the growth parameters needed. The most interesting case was K. marxianus and lactose, where aerofermentative growth can occur and the model was adjusted to account for this phenomenon. ^ <b>Objective</b> (<b>iii)</b> was fulfilled by performing and modeling the yeast co-cultures in media containing the mixed substrates. No significant difference was observed in the COD reduction levels (80 %) between batch and CSTR. The batch culture produced a final yeast biomass with a proportion of each strain similar to the inoculum proportion. In CSTR, C. utilis dominated (90 %) because of its lower nutrient requirements at the low dilution rates investigated. ^ The growth rates were faster under non oxygen-limiting conditions, obtained when the total substrate concentration did not exceed 15 g/L. The model predicted very well the substrate utilization and COD reduction profiles in batch cultures. The results were excellent when non oxygen-limiting conditions persisted in the cultures, but showed some discontinuities in the dissolved oxygen profiles if the culture switched from excess oxygen to oxygen-limiting conditions. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{motivated}} by the wide family changes which started in the 1960 s in Europe and the United States. In light {{of the process of}} the deinstitutionalisation of marriage, the thesis examines the role of increasing marital instability and rising prevalence of cohabitation in repartnering and fertility after union dissolution. The thesis has three objectives: (i) to provide detailed description of the state of women’s repartnering dynamics by union type in Europe and the US, (ii) to examine the role of women’s demographic characteristics in repartnering behaviour in 14 European countries, and (iii) to assess the effect of mothers’ partnership history on continued childbearing following separation. The objectives of this thesis are addressed by using the Harmonized Histories and employing demographic approach (life-table estimates) and statistical methods (discrete-time hazard models). Findings regarding objective (i) : The results show an increase in women’s repartnering levels across birth cohorts, however, substantial cross-national difference exists. Repartnering starts predominantly with cohabitation, yet countries differ significantly in the pace at which repartnering occurs. There is a strong positive association between the level of union dissolution and the pace of repartnering in Europe and the US. The proportion of women who repartner within 5 years after first union dissolution is similar or slightly higher for previously cohabiting women than for divorcees. Findings regarding objective (ii) : Women’s age and presence of children at union dissolution have strong negative effects on repartnering in all European countries. First union type has no significant effect on repartnering. The variation in micro-level demographic characteristics does not fully explain the cross-national differences in repartnering behaviour in Europe. More research on the role of macro-level factors in explaining cross-national differences in repartnering is needed. Findings regarding <b>objective</b> (<b>iii)</b> : The union type in which women entered motherhood does not matter for continued childbearing after separation. Current union status is significantly associated with mothers’ birth risks after dissolution of first fertile union. Currently cohabiting women have significantly lower birth risks after separation than currently married mothers. The birth risks of currently married or currently cohabiting mothers do not depend on the type of union in which women entered motherhood. The results indicate that despite increases in cohabitation childbearing is still associated with marriage...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Focused on the accelerometer-determined {{physical}} activity and sedentary time metrics in 9 – 11 -year-old children, we sought to determine the following: (i) number of days {{that are necessary to}} achieve reliable estimates (Ggreater than or equal to 0. 8); (ii) proportion of variance attributed to different facets (participants and days) of reliability estimates; and (iii) actual reliability of data as collected in The International Study of Childhood Obesity, Lifestyle and Environment (ISCOLE). Methods: The analytical sample consisted of 6025 children (55 % girls) from sites in 12 countries. Physical activity and sedentary time metrics measures were assessed for up to 7 consecutive days for 24 h per day with a waist-worn ActiGraph GT 3 X+. Generalizability theory using R software was used to investigate the objectives i and ii. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were computed using SAS PROC GLM to inform <b>objective</b> <b>iii.</b> Results: The estimated minimum number of days required to achieve a reliability estimate of Ggreater than or equal to 0. 8 ranged from 5 to 9 for boys and 3 to 11 for girls for light {{physical activity}} (LPA); 5 to 9 and 3 to 10, for moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA); 5 to 10 and 4 to 10 for total activity counts; and 7 to 11 and 6 to 11 for sedentary time, respectively. For all variables investigated, the ‘participant’ facet accounted for 30 – 50 % of the variability, whereas the ‘days’ facet accounted for {{less than or equal to}} 5 %, and the interaction (P × D) accounted for 50 – 70 % of the variability. The actual reliability for boys in ISCOLE ranged from ICCs of 0. 78 to 0. 86, 0. 73 to 0. 85 and 0. 72 to 0. 86 for LPA, MVPA and total activity counts, respectively, and 0. 67 to 0. 79 for sedentary time. The corresponding values for girls were 0. 80 – 0. 88, 0. 70 – 0. 89, 0. 74 – 0. 86 and 0. 64 – 0. 80. Conclusions: It was rare that only 4 days from all participants would be enough to achieve desirable reliability estimates. However, asking participants to wear the device for 7 days and requiring greater than or equal to 4 days of data to include the participant in the analysis might be an appropriate approach to achieve reliable estimates for most accelerometer-derived metrics...|$|E

Our literature review shows that most research on biases was done 15 – 30 years ago. This study focuses on biases that are introduced {{at an early}} stage of MCDA when building objectives hierarchies and their effect on the weights. The main objective is to investigate whether prior findings regarding such biases, which were mostly based on laboratory experiments, can be found in real-world applications. We conducted a meta-analysis of the objectives hierarchies and weight elicitation procedures in 61 environmental and energy MCDA cases. Relationships between the structural characteristics of the objectives hierarchy and assigned objectives’ weights were analysed with statistical tests. Our main research questions were: (i) How does hierarchy size and structure affect the objectives’ weights? (ii) How are weights distributed across economic, social and environmental <b>objectives?</b> (<b>iii)</b> Is there support for the equalising bias? Our findings are mostly aligned with earlier research and suggest that the hierarchy structure and content can substantially influence weight distributions. For example, hierarchical weighting seems {{to be sensitive to the}} asymmetry bias, which can occur when a hierarchy has branches that differ in the number of sub-objectives. We found no evidence for the equalising bias. We highlight issues deserving more attention when developing objectives hierarchies and eliciting weights.

40|$|Despite {{substantial}} {{contribution to}} the economies of their countries, mobile pastoralists are marginalised in many aspects of their daily lives. Mobility complicates their access to schooling or health and veterinary services. They increasingly face challenges concerning their right to use natural resources in the south-eastern Lake Chad area. Mobile communities compete with sedentary ones over access to land and water, {{as more and more}} people move into the area of the receding lake. Little is known about the demography of mobile pastoralists. They are poorly represented in national censuses because the assessment of mobile populations proves difficult and costly. The longstanding partnership and a history of transdisciplinary experience, connecting the population, authorities and researchers in the study area has led to mutual trust and has contributed to an environment open to innovative approaches. The concept of One Health (combining human and animal healthcare and using synergies) is well known and appreciated in the area. The general objectives of the work presented here were: I. 	 To assess the density of sedentary and mobile people and their animals in the study zone at different time points. II. 	 To test and evaluate a small-scale demographic surveillance system for mobile pastoralists and their animals using mobile phones. III. 	 To investigate a disease perceived as a priority by mobile pastoralists. Throughout the data collection we conducted semi-structured interviews with representatives of all sampled communities to assess the livelihood priorities of the sedentary as well as the mobile population. The main concerns were access to food, animal and human healthcare, access to resources and the frequent conflicts between mobile and sedentary communities, access to education, legal restrictions and the loss of harvest caused by natural disasters.

40|$|Appetite is {{regulated}} by {{a balance between}} excitatory (drive) and inhibitory (satiety) processes. Dysregulation of this balance leads to eating disorders. However, the neuronal mechanism of control of appetite has not been clearly understood. A cichlid fish, the Nile tilapia(Oreochromis niloticus) is a maternal mouthbrooder in which the female churns the eggs in her mouth for 10 - 14 days. During mouthbrooding, female fish stops feeding and minimizes energy expenditure to maintain energy homeostasis. Thus, the mouthbrooding tilapia is an ideal model to study the mechanism of appetite regulation and energy homeostasis in the reproductive state. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is a potent orexigenic neuropeptide which is highly conserved in vertebrates. Although central NPY is known to essentially promote feeding and reduce energy expenditure, recent research has revealed that NPY expression is also influenced by different physiological states. In this thesis, we hypothesize that NPY plays an integral role in linking reproductive and metabolic functions. In Objective I (Chapter 2), we examined the distribution of NPY neurons in the brain to understand its possible role regulation of reproduction in the mouthbrooding tilapia. The 5 ’and 3 ’ rapid amplification of cDNA ends method was used to obtain the full length sequence of NPY cDNA. In situ hybridization technique was used to localize NPY cells in three major central brain areas which includes the telencephalon, preoptic area and hypothalamus. In Objective II (Chapter 3), to examine potential roles of three NPY cell populations in the appetite control, npy mRNA expression levels were examined in three brain regions containing NPY cells in mouthbrooding and induced fasting female fish. In the mouthbrooding female, npy mRNA levels were significantly decreased in the hypothalamus of 4 and 12 day mouthbrooding females in comparison to non-mouthbrooding females. In induced fasting female, npy mRNA levels were significantly increased only in the telencephalon. These results suggest different roles of the NPY neuronal populations in the regulation of appetite and energy homeostasis. A significant increase in leptin receptor (Lep-R) and ghrelin receptors (GHS-R) subtypes namely GHS-R 1 a and GHS-R 1 b gene expression was measured in mouthbrooding fish. We also found {{a significant increase in}} kisspeptin (Kiss 2) gene expression in the hypothalamus. In <b>Objective</b> <b>III</b> (Chapter 4), to identify potential association between metabolism and reproduction, effect of kisspeptin on NPY gene was examined in female tilapia under different feeding regimes. Intraperitoneal injection of tilapia kisspeptin (Kiss 2) decreased NPY mRNA expression in all feeding groups. Furthermore, in situ hybridization confirmed the distribution of kisspeptin receptor in NPY cell containing regions, suggesting its potential action on NPY systems. The colocalization of the kiss 2 R mRNA in some NPY mRNA containing cells using the double in situ hybridization in the telencephalon, preoptic area and the hypothalamus, confirmed the role of NPY neurons an important candidate gene in the regulation of feeding and energy metabolism during reproduction. Collectively, the outcome of the three main objectives revealed the neural population specific function of NPY under different feeding conditions. In addition, the different NPY systems are possibly differentially regulated by other neuroendocrine factors including kisspeptin as well as peripheral cues from leptin and ghrelin under different physiological conditions. This study led to the identification of an alternative NPY signaling by Kiss 2 to influence feeding behavior and energy homeostasis under specific physiological conditions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{continuous}} tillage {{on the distribution}} of soil organic matter (SOM) and aggregates have been well studied for arable soils. However, less is known about the effects of sporadic tillage on SOM and aggregate dynamics in grassland soils. The objectives of the present thesis were (I) to study the longer-term effects of sporadic tillage of grassland on organic carbon (Corg) stocks and the distribution of aggregates and SOM, (II) to investigate the combined effects of sporadic tillage and fertilization on carbon and nitrogen dynamics in grassland soils, and (III) to study the temporal dynamics of Corg stocks, aggregate distribution and microbial biomass in grassland soils. Soil samples were taken in three soil depths (0 – 10 cm; 10 – 25 cm; 25 – 40 cm) from a field trial with loamy sandy soils (Cambisols, Eutric Luvisols, Stagnosols, Anthrosols) north of Kiel, Germany. For Objective I we have sampled soil two and five years after one or two tillage operation(s). Treatments consisted of (i) permanent grassland, (ii) tillage of grassland followed by a re-establishment of grassland and (iii) tillage of grassland followed by a re-establishment of grassland with one season of winter wheat in between. The tillage in grassland led to a reduction in Corg stocks, large macroaggregates (> 2000 µm) and SOM in the top 10 cm soil depth. These findings were still significant two years after tillage; however, five years after tillage no longer present. Regarding the soil profile (0 – 40 cm) no significant differences in the mentioned parameters between the tilled plots and the permanent grassland existed. A second tillage event and the insertion of one season of winter wheat did not lead to any further effects on Corg stocks as well as aggregate and SOM concentrations in comparison with a single tillage event in these grassland soils. Treatments adapted for Objective II included (i) long-term grassland and (ii) tillage of grassland followed by a re-establishment of grassland with one season of winter wheat in between. The plots were split and received either 240 kg N ha- 1 year- 1 in the form of cattle slurry or no cattle slurry application. The application of slurry within a period of four years had no effects on the Corg and total nitrogen stocks or the aggregate distribution, but led to a reduction of free and not physically protected SOM. However, the application of cattle slurry and the grassland renovation seems to change the plant species composition and therefore generalizations on the direct effects are not yet possible. For studying <b>Objective</b> <b>III</b> a further field trial was initiated in September 2010. Soil samples were taken six times within one year (from October 2010 to October 2011) (i) after the conversion from arable land into grassland, (ii) after the tillage of grassland followed by a re-establishment of grassland and (iii) in a permanent grassland. We found an increase in the microbial and fungal biomass after the conversion of arable land into grassland, but no effect on aggregate distribution and Corg stocks. A one-time tillage operation in grassland led to a reduction in large macroaggregates and Corg stocks in the top 10 cm soil depth with no effect on the sampled soil profile. However, we found large variations in the fungal biomass and aggregate distribution within one year in the permanent grassland, presumably caused by environmental factors. Overall, our results suggest that a single tillage operation in grassland soils markedly decreased the concentrations of Corg, larger aggregates and SOM. However, this does not result in long-lasting effects on the above mentioned parameters. The application of slurry cannot compensate the negative effects of a tillage event on aggregate concentrations or Corg stocks. However, while the Corg concentration is not subject to fluctuations within a year, there are large variations of the aggregate distribution even in a permanent grassland soil. Therefore conclusions of results from a single sampling time should be handled with care...|$|E

40|$|A {{functional}} ecology {{approach was}} combined with floristic studies to seek increased ecological understanding of forest characteristics and {{processes in the}} Central Highlands of Chiapas State, Mexico. The study had two main aims: 1) to determine the major ecological factors driving the floristic and functional variation of forest ecosystems, with emphasis on the operation of either environmental (niche model) or spatial (dispersal limitation model) factors and 2) to determine the relationship of leaf-litter decomposition rates to both leaf functional traits and forest conditions. For this, the specific objectives were i), characterise both the dominant species and the forest stands they form using functional traits, determining also the trait-trait and species-trait relationships; ii), characterise the floristic and functional variation amongst forest stands, {{and the relationship of}} this variation with spatial and environmental variables; iii) determine the influence of spatial factors, climate variables, anthropogenic disturbance, forest canopy openness and the traits of species on the abundance of saplings and iv), determine the effect of species leaf trait values, forest type, and their interaction, on leaf-litter decomposition. The study area encompassed a narrow altitudinal range from 2100 to 2800 m a. s. l., located on a carboniferous limestone substrate with abrupt topography and a cool and humid climate. For objectives i), ii) and iii), both adult trees and saplings were counted, measured and identified in field plots in four previously-defined forest types –oak forest, pine-oak forest, pine forest and broadleaved forest– at seven study sites. Plots were characterised in terms of spatial location, altitude above sea level and climate variables from Worldclim climate surfaces. Leaf, stem and whole-plant traits, as well as leaf carbon fractions, were measured for dominant species, and saplings were sampled under both closed and open canopies. For objective iv), first, leaf litter decomposition rates of 20 dominant species were measured in a greenhouse experiment for the assessment of trait effects and second, decomposition rates of representative litter from each forest type, plus two standard species, were measured in a field experiment using forest type as the main factor. Forests of the study area are a mosaic in which three main functional groups of species were identified (objective i). Two groups were respectively dominated by Quercus species and Pinus species, which both reach the canopy or sub-canopy layers of the forests and had high wood density, leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and other trait values suggesting relatively slow growth. The third group contained a wide taxonomic range of species that generally develop in the forest understorey and had high specific leaf area, leaf nutrient contents and other trait values suggesting relatively high rates of growth and population turnover. These three functional groups of species form a variety of floristic assemblages, ranging from those of simple structure and low floristic diversity (mostly pine forests) to complex and diverse broad-leaved forests. Most oak and pine-oak forests had intermediate characteristics. Variation partitioning analysis showed that the floristic variation of both adults and saplings was related to climate but also to spatial factors, suggesting an important role of dispersal limitation in the shaping of species assemblages (objectives ii and iii). In contrast, variation partitioning also showed that forest functional characteristics –measured using weighted mean trait values– were strongly linked to human disturbance, suggesting that people have had strong effects on the ecological functions of these forests (objective ii). Additionally, floristic variation among forest stands was not always accompanied by functional variation, suggesting that floristics can change across space while forest functional characteristics remain relatively homogeneous. Regarding <b>objective</b> (<b>iii),</b> leaf area was the only species functional trait with a clear relationship to the absolute densities of saplings, suggesting that the abundance of regeneration increases with increasing leaf area, though the effect of canopy openness was small. Finally, for objective iv), the greenhouse experiment showed that Quercus spp. and Pinus spp. with tough leaves had relatively slow decomposition rates and species with lower LDMC and associated tradeoffs in trait values, such as high specific leaf area, had higher decomposition rates. In the field experiment (objective iv), decomposition rates did not vary significantly between the four different forest types, supporting the hypothesis that persistent leaf characteristics of species, rather than forest functional characteristics and environment, are the most important controls on decomposition. Nevertheless, there was evidence that litter mixtures tended to show higher decomposition rates in forest associations where they were collected, than in other forest associations (the “home-field advantage” hypothesis). This result suggests probable variations in leaf-litter substrates determined by forest functional composition. It is believed {{that this is the first}} study to apply a functional traits approach to understanding variation of forest ecological characteristics and processes in Mesoamerican mountains. The study shows that dispersal limitation, as well as environmental and anthropogenic factors, probably influences the characteristics of forest stands, and that the degree of functional variation may be smaller than that of floristic variation. The study demonstrates that leaf trait values of dominant tree species influence litter decomposition rates and therefore, potentially, nutrient cycling. Even though litter decomposition rates in the field were most likely to be affected by leaf and litter characteristics, not forest environment, there was evidence for a home-field advantage effect. In the current era of anthropogenic global change effects on the forests of Chiapas, this work sheds new light on forest function and forest change and has special relevance for the design of conservation strategies for the tropical montane ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{renewable}} primary products as co-substrate or single substrate for biogas production has increased consistently {{over the last}} few years. Maize silage is the preferential energy crop used for fermentation due to its high methane (CH 4) yield per hectare. Equally, the by-product, namely biogas slurry (BS), is used with increasing frequency as organic fertilizer to return nutrients to the soil and to maintain or increase the organic matter stocks and soil fertility. Studies concerning the application of energy crop-derived BS on the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization dynamics are scarce. Thus, this thesis focused on the following objectives: I) The determination of the effects caused by rainfall patterns on the C and N dynamics from two contrasting organic fertilizers, namely BS from maize silage and composted cattle manure (CM), by monitoring emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and CH 4 as well as leaching losses of C and N. II) The investigation of the impact of differences in soil moisture content after the application of BS and temperature on gaseous emissions (CO 2, N 2 O and CH 4) and leaching of C and N compounds. III) A comparison of BS properties obtained from biogas plants with different substrate inputs and operating parameters and their effect on C and N dynamics after application to differently textured soils with varying application rates and water contents. For the objectives I) and II) two experiments (experiment I and II) using undisturbed soil cores of a Haplic Luvisol were carried out. <b>Objective</b> <b>III)</b> was studied on a third experiment (experiment III) with disturbed soil samples. During experiment I three rainfall patterns were implemented including constant irrigation, continuous irrigation with periodic heavy rainfall events, and partial drying with rewetting periods. Biogas slurry and CM were applied at a rate of 100 kg N ha- 1. During experiment II constant irrigation and an irrigation pattern with partial drying with rewetting periods were carried out at 13. 5 °C and 23. 5 °C. The application of BS took place either directly before a rewetting period or one week after the rewetting period stopped. Experiment III included two soils of different texture which were mixed with ten BS’s originating from ten different biogas plants. Treatments included low, medium and high BS-N application rates and water contents ranging from 50 % to 100 % of water holding capacity (WHC). Experiment I and II showed that after the application of BS cumulative N 2 O emissions were 4 times (162 mg N 2 O-N m- 2) higher compared to the application of CM caused by a higher content of mineral N (Nmin) in the form of ammonium (NH 4 +) in the BS. The cumulative emissions of CO 2, however, were on the same level for both fertilizers indicating similar amounts of readily available C after composting and fermentation of organic material. Leaching losses occurred predominantly in the mineral form of nitrate (NO 3 -) and were higher in BS amended soils (9 mg NO 3 [...] N m- 2) compared to CM amended soils (5 mg NO 3 [...] N m- 2). The rainfall pattern in experiment I and II merely affected the temporal production of C and N emissions resulting in reduced CO 2 and enhanced N 2 O emissions during stronger irrigation events, but showed no effect on the cumulative emissions. Overall, a significant increase of CH 4 consumption under inconstant irrigation was found. The time of fertilization had no effect on the overall C and N dynamics. Increasing temperature from 13. 5 °C to 23. 5 °C enhanced the CO 2 and N 2 O emissions by a factor of 1. 7 and 3. 7, respectively. Due to the increased microbial activity with increasing temperature soil respiration was enhanced. This led to decreasing oxygen (O 2) contents which in turn promoted denitrification in soil due to the extension of anaerobic microsites. Leaching losses of NO 3 - were also significantly affected by increasing temperature whereas the consumption of CH 4 was not affected. The third experiment showed that the input materials of biogas plants affected the properties of the resulting BS. In particular the contents of DM and NH 4 + were determined by the amount of added plant biomass and excrement-based biomass, respectively. Correlations between BS properties and CO 2 or N 2 O emissions were not detected. Solely the ammonia (NH 3) emissions showed a positive correlation with NH 4 + content in BS as well as a negative correlation with the total C (Ct) content. The BS-N application rates affected the relative CO 2 emissions (% of C supplied with BS) when applied to silty soil as well as the relative N 2 O emissions (% of N supplied with BS) when applied to sandy soil. The impacts on the C and N dynamics induced by BS application were exceeded by the differences induced by soil texture. Presumably, due to the higher clay content in silty soils, organic matter was stabilized by organo-mineral interactions and NH 4 + was adsorbed at the cation exchange sites. Different water contents induced highest CO 2 emissions and therefore optimal conditions for microbial activity at 75 % of WHC in both soils. Cumulative nitrification was also highest at 75 % and 50 % of WHC whereas the relative N 2 O emissions increased with water content and showed higher N 2 O losses in sandy soils. In summary it can be stated that the findings of the present thesis confirmed the high fertilizer value of BS’s, caused by high concentrations of NH 4 + and labile organic compounds such as readily available carbon. These attributes of BS’s are to a great extent independent of the input materials of biogas plants. However, considerably gaseous and leaching losses of N may occur especially at high moisture contents. The emissions of N 2 O after field application corresponded with those of animal slurries.

40|$|Reduction or {{elimination}} of nuclear arms {{is not likely}} to occur absent a lower perceived need for a nuclear weapons arsenal to support national security. Achieving such confidence on a national-level is the grand challenge. Lessons from verification of peaceful uses of nuclear fuel cycle activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) over more than 50 years has taught us that achieving confidence requires a coherent and comprehensive picture of the State’s compliance with its obligations. This may be achieved by piecing together, in a well-structured way, a broad range of information encompassing declared, undeclared, international technical monitoring data, information from national technical means, open source, state-level, and international trade and diplomacy related to the material and capabilities under consideration. The paper proposes a state-level analytical approach to be considered in developing future arms reductions initiatives based on the IAEA’s State-Level Concept (SLC). The SLC outlines sequences of activities (cheating pathways) that a State could consider to acquire weapons usable material. It analyzes all plausible CPs aiming to determine whether a proposed set of safeguards measures will be sufficient. Mapping out the CPs is essentially producing a state-specific network of process and material and flows with identified nodes for inter-connections. The “relative attractiveness” of a CP, or usefulness in a nuclear weapons program, is considered in addition to the time it would take to implement such a process in a country. The SLC might allow State-specific approaches to nuclear arms control with differentiation between States, taking into account all information available to the authorities and being responsive to the variations in risk of cheating. Similar to the IAEA SLC, the process could be implemented in three steps: (i) Identification of cheating pathways (CP), (ii) Specification and prioritization of State-specific technical <b>objectives,</b> (<b>iii)</b> Identification of verification measures to address the technical objectives. Initial consideration of using this methodology to verify nuclear materials in states possessing nuclear weapons is outlined.
