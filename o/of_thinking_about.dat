5|$|But reform {{brought with}} it new ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the church and its personnel, derived not only from {{contemporary}} continental movements {{but also from the}} rich pastoral and canonical literature of the Carolingian renaissance. This disseminated ideas concerning the separation of the lay and religious spheres, the distinction between monks and clergy, and enhanced the authority of bishops as both pastoral and political leaders. Ultimately, these ideas were to strike at deeply entrenched features of the early medieval church, such as hereditary control of churches and the right of the clergy to marry.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{advances}} in psychological, medical, and physiological research {{have led to}} a new way <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> health and illness. This conceptualization, which has been labeled the biopsychosocial model, views health and illness as the product of a combination of factors including biological characteristics (e.g., genetic predisposition), behavioral factors (e.g., lifestyle, stress, health beliefs), and social conditions (e.g., cultural influences, family relationships, social support).|$|E

Simply put, the important part is notions like connections and components, not the choice between writing them as predicates or LISP constructs.|$|E

Two related ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> the problem of climate change decision-making in the presence of uncertainty are iterative risk management and sequential decision making Considerations in a risk-based approach might include, for example, the potential for low-probability, worst-case climate change impacts.|$|E
25|$|Plato's philosopher, {{in search}} of the real and the true, must turn away from this {{transitory}} realm and contemplate the eternal Forms and Ideas. The pensive man in Hopper's painting is positioned between the lure of the earthly domain, figured by the woman, and the call of the higher spiritual domain, represented by the ethereal lightfall. The pain <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> this choice and its consequences, after reading Plato all night, is evident. He is paralysed by the fervent inner labour of the melancholic.|$|E
25|$|McLuhan {{writes about}} robotism {{in the context}} of Japanese Zen Buddhism and how it can offer us new ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> {{technology}}. The Western way <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> technology is too much related to the left hemisphere of our brain, which has a rational and linear focus. What he called robotism might better be called androidism in the wake of Blade Runner and the novels of Philip K. Dick. Robotism-androidism emerges from the further development of the right hemisphere of the brain, creativity and a new relationship to spacetime (most humans are still living in 17th century classical Newtonian physics spacetime). Robots-androids will have much greater flexibility than humans have had until now, in both mind and body. Robots-androids will teach humanity this new flexibility. And this flexibility of androids (what McLuhan calls robotism) has a strong affinity with Japanese culture and life. McLuhan quotes from Ruth Benedict, The Chrysanthemum and the Sword, an anthropological study of Japanese culture published in 1946: “Occidentals cannot easily credit the ability of the Japanese to swing from one behavior to another without psychic cost. Such extreme possibilities are not included in our experience. Yet in Japanese life the contradictions, as they seem to us, are as deeply based in their view of life as our uniformities are in ours.” The ability to live in the present and instantly readjust.|$|E

25|$|With these {{limitations}} in mind, fitness landscapes {{can still be}} an instructive way <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> evolution. It is fundamentally possible to measure (even if not to visualise) some of the parameters of landscape ruggedness and of peak number, height, separation, and clustering. Simplified 3D landscapes can then be used relative to each other to visually represent the relevant features. Additionally, fitness landscapes of small subsets of evolutionary pathways may be experimentally constructed and visualized, potentially revealing features such as fitness peaks and valleys. Fitness landscapes of evolutionary pathways indicate the probable evolutionary steps and endpoints among sets of individual mutations.|$|E
25|$|In 1498, Annius of Viterbo (an {{official}} of Pope Alexander VI) {{claimed to have}} discovered lost books of Berossus. These were in fact an elaborate forgery. However, they greatly influenced Renaissance ways <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> population and migration, because Annius provided a list of kings from Japhet onwards, filling a historical gap following the Biblical account of the Flood. Annius also introduced characters from classical sources into the biblical framework, publishing his account as Commentaria super opera diversorum auctorum de antiquitatibus loquentium (Commentaries on the Works of Various Authors Discussing Antiquity). One consequence was sophisticated theories about Celtic races with Druid priests in Western Europe.|$|E
25|$|Abduction, deduction, and {{induction}} make incomplete {{sense in}} isolation from one another but comprise a cycle understandable as a whole insofar as they collaborate toward the common end of inquiry. In the pragmatic way <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> conceivable practical implications, every thing has a purpose, and, as possible, its purpose should first be denoted. Abduction hypothesizes an explanation for deduction to clarify into implications to be tested so that induction can evaluate the hypothesis, {{in the struggle to}} move from troublesome uncertainty to more secure belief. No matter how traditional and needful it is to study the modes of inference in abstraction from one another, the integrity of inquiry strongly limits the effective modularity of its principal components.|$|E

50|$|In philosophy, {{intelligibility}} is {{what can}} be comprehended by the human mind in contrast to sense perception. The intelligible method is thought thinking itself, or the human mind reflecting on itself. Plato referred to the intelligible realm of mathematics, forms, first principles, logical deduction, and the dialectical method. The intelligible realm <b>of</b> thought <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> thought does not necessarily require any visual images, sensual impressions, and material causes for the contents of mind. Descartes referred to this method <b>of</b> thought <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> itself, without the possible illusions of the senses. Kant made similar claims about a priori knowledge. A priori knowledge is claimed to be independent {{of the content of}} experience.|$|R

25|$|There {{is a clear}} {{distinction}} between feeling lonely and being socially isolated (for example, a loner). In particular, one way <b>of</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>about</b> loneliness is as a discrepancy between one's necessary and achieved levels of social interaction, while solitude is simply the lack of contact with people. Loneliness is therefore a subjective experience; if a person thinks they are lonely, then they are lonely. People can be lonely while in solitude, or {{in the middle of a}} crowd. What makes a person lonely is the fact that they need more social interaction or a certain type of social interaction that is not currently available. A person can be in the middle of a party and feel lonely due to not talking to enough people. Conversely, one can be alone and not feel lonely; even though there is no one around that person is not lonely because there is no desire for social interaction. There have also been suggestions that each person has their own sweet spot of social interaction. If a person gets too little or too much social interaction, this could lead to feelings of loneliness or over-stimulation.|$|E
