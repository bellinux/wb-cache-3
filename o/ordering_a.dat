5|$|The short was {{released}} on the home media release of Iron Man 3, and was received positively by critics and the audience from an earlier screening at San Diego Comic-Con.

5|$|To {{commemorate the}} 50th anniversary of Jeff Hall's death, the club {{commissioned}} a memorial clock {{to replace the}} original which did not survive the 1990s renovations. Placed centrally above the Main Stand, it was unveiled in September 2008 by Hall's teammates Alex Govan and Gil Merrick. However, adverse reaction to the clock's size and position provoked the club into <b>ordering</b> <b>a</b> larger replacement to be incorporated in a proposed big screen.|$|E
5|$|Abercrombie {{made two}} notable errors of {{judgment}} during the battle. One {{was a failure}} to recognize after {{the first wave of}} attacks that his chosen method of attack was unlikely to work. Instead of ordering additional waves of troops to the slaughter, he should have retreated to a safe distance and considered alternative actions. The second failure was that he apparently never considered <b>ordering</b> <b>a</b> flanking maneuver against the French right. At a minimum this would have stretched the French defenses, allowing his attackers elsewhere to find weak points. In fact, the French twice in the battle sent companies of militia out of their works on the right to enfilade the British attackers.|$|E

5|$|After McCoy {{told them}} they were the Miami Showband, Thomas Crozier (who had a notebook) asked the band members for their names and addresses, while the others bantered with them about {{the success of their}} {{performance}} that night. As Crozier took down the information, a car pulled up and another uniformed man appeared on the scene. He wore a uniform and beret noticeably different from the others. He spoke with an educated English accent and immediately took charge, <b>ordering</b> <b>a</b> man who appeared to have been the leader of the patrol, to tell Crozier to obtain their names and dates of birth instead of addresses.|$|E
5|$|Fleming {{also used}} {{historical}} references {{for some of}} his names and Marc-Ange Draco's name is based upon that of El Draco, the Spanish nickname for Sir Francis Drake, a fact also used by J. K. Rowling for the naming of her character Draco Malfoy. For Tracy's background, Fleming used that of Muriel Wright, a married wartime lover of Fleming's, who died in an air-raid and Bond's grief {{for the loss of}} his wife is an echo of Fleming's at the loss of Wright. Fleming did make mistakes in the novel, however, such as Bond <b>ordering</b> <b>a</b> half-bottle of Pol Roger Champagne: Fleming's friend Patrick Leigh Fermor pointed out that Pol Roger was the only champagne at the time not to be produced in half-bottles.|$|E

The breakthrough was soon accomplished by attacking the gaps in the Venetian lines, causing disorder among their ranks. The battle continued for hours until large groups of Venetian troops began to flee. Skanderbeg, seeing his fleeing adversaries, ordered a full-scale offensive, routing the entire Venetian army. The Republic's soldiers were chased right to the gates of Scutari, and Venetian prisoners were thereafter paraded outside the fortress.|$|E
5|$|The Bosnian War {{began in}} 1992, {{as a result}} of the breakup of Yugoslavia.

From June 1993 until October 1996, Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28February 1994, NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the no-fly zone.|$|E

5|$|The {{regional}} ORCA {{card was}} introduced as an integrated smart card for transit {{agencies in the}} Puget Sound region on April 20, 2009, allowing users to load monthly passes and value through an e-purse web interface. The card also allowed free transfers within a two-hour period between transit agencies of equal value, with the difference for higher fare subtracted from the e-purse or prompting for cash. While initially available for no fee, effective March 1, 2010 a $5 cost was added when <b>ordering</b> <b>a</b> standard adult or youth ORCA card.

5|$|To {{reestablish}} their {{supply lines}} and retake {{the towns of}} Bardaï, Zouar and Wour, the Libyans sent a task-force of 2,000 troops with T-62 tanks and heavy support by the Libyan Air Force into the Tibesti. The offensive started successfully, expelling the GUNT from its key strongholds, also {{through the use of}} napalm. This attack ultimately backfired, causing the prompt reaction of Habré, who sent 2,000 FANT soldiers to link with the GUNT forces. Also Mitterrand reacted forcefully, <b>ordering</b> <b>a</b> mission which parachuted fuel, food, ammunition and anti-tank missiles to the rebels, and also infiltrated military personnel. Through this action, the French made clear that they no longer felt committed to keep south of the Red Line, and were ready to act whenever they found it necessary.|$|E
5|$|Bonaparte's armada sailed from Toulon on 19 May 1798, making rapid {{progress}} through the Ligurian Sea and collecting more ships at Genoa, before sailing southwards along the Sardinian coast and passing Sicily on 7 June. On 9 June, the fleet arrived off Malta, then under the ownership of the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem, ruled by Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim. Bonaparte demanded that his fleet be permitted entry to the fortified harbour of Valletta. When the Knights refused, the French general responded by <b>ordering</b> <b>a</b> large scale invasion of the Maltese Islands, overrunning the defenders after 24 hours of skirmishing. The Knights formally surrendered on 12 June and, in exchange for substantial financial compensation, handed the islands and all of their resources over to Bonaparte, including the extensive property of the Roman Catholic Church on Malta. Within a week, Bonaparte had resupplied his ships, and on 19 June, his fleet departed for Alexandria {{in the direction of}} Crete, leaving 4,000 men at Valletta under General Claude-Henri Vaubois to ensure French control of the islands.|$|E

The Municipal Court in Prague acquitted Soghojan due to lack of evidence; however, the decision was repealed on appeal by the High Court, and the case will be heard again by a different tribunal of the Municipal Court.

5|$|Meanwhile, some rebels {{took over}} a {{civilian}} hospital; subsequently stormed by government soldiers, the rebels were rounded up, tortured and 22 were executed without trial. Those that had escaped, including Fidel and Raúl, assembled at their base where some debated surrender, while others wished to flee to Havana. Accompanied by 19 comrades, Castro decided to set out for Gran Piedra in the rugged Sierra Maestra mountains several miles to the north, where they could establish a guerrilla base. In response to the Moncada attack, Batista's government proclaimed martial law, <b>ordering</b> <b>a</b> violent crackdown on dissent and imposing strict censorship of the media. Propaganda broadcast misinformation about the event, claiming that the rebels were communists who had killed hospital patients. Despite this censorship, news and photographs soon spread of the army's use of torture and summary executions in Oriente, causing widespread public and some governmental disapproval.|$|E

In the wake of the retreat, the disorganized Eighth Army regrouped and re-formed. I Corps relinquished command of the 1st Cavalry Division, the 24th Infantry Division, and the 27th British Brigade, taking command of the 3rd Infantry Division and the 25th Infantry Division in their place. On 1 January 1951, 500,000 Chinese troops attacked the Eighth Army's line at the Imjin River, forcing them back 50 miles and allowing the Chinese to capture Seoul. The Chinese eventually advanced too far for their supply lines to adequately support them, and their attack stalled. The Eighth Army, battered by the Chinese assault, began to prepare spring offensives to retake lost ground.|$|E
