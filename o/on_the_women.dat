5|$|According to Sean Scalmer, Gandhi in {{his final}} year of life was an ascetic, looked ugly and a sickly {{skeletal}} figure, already caricatured in the Western media. Gandhi's public experiments, as they progressed, were widely discussed and criticised by his family members and leading politicians. However, Gandhi {{said that if he}} would not let Manu sleep with him, it would be a sign of weakness. Nirmalkumar Bose, Gandhi's Bengali interpreter, for example criticised Gandhi, not because Gandhi did anything wrong, but because Bose was concerned about the psychological effect <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> who participated in his experiments. Veena Howard states Gandhi's views on brahmacharya and religious renunciation experiments were a method to confront women issues in his times.|$|E

Blackfish pointed out that he had brought 40 horses to transport those unable to walk. Boone asked for another day to consult with the others.

25|$|Most pornographic {{films are}} {{directed}} at a heterosexual male viewer, {{and the primary}} focus and most on-screen time is <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> in them. Pornographic films attempt to present a sexual fantasy and actresses are selected {{on their ability to}} create or fit that fantasy. Many times the fantasy can be an actress' physical features and appearance, such as figure, breast size, hair style, ethnicity, as well as on her willingness and expertise in performing particular sex acts. Actresses are required to present a positive attitude to on-screen sexual performance with all sex acts being presented as enjoyable and joyfully entered into. Actresses are usually presented as always being available and willing to engage in any sex acts that their on-screen partner, as the proxy of the viewer, wishes.|$|E

25|$|At {{the request}} of the Security Council, the Secretary-General issued a report on women's {{participation}} in peacebuilding in 2010. The report outlines the challenges women continue to face in participating in recovery and peacebuilding process and the negative impact this exclustion has on them and societies more broadly. To respond to these challenges, it advocates a comprehensive 7-point action plan covering the seven commitment areas: mediation; post-conflict planning; financing; civilian capacity; post-conflict governance; rule of law; and economic recovery. The action plan aims to facilitate progress <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>women,</b> peace and security agenda. The monitoring and implementation of this action plan is now being led jointly by the Peacebuilding Support Office and UN Women. In April 2011, the two organizations convened a workshop to ensure that women are included in future post-disaster and post-conflict planning documents. In the same year, the PBF selected seven gender-sensitive peacebuilding projects to receive $5 million in funding.|$|E
25|$|On December 1, 1598, Juan de Zaldívar, Oñate's nephew, reached Acoma with 20–30 men and peacefully traded {{with them}} and had to wait some days for their order of ground corn. On December 4th, Zaldívar went with 16 armored men to Acoma {{to find out about}} the corn. Zutacapan met them and {{directed}} them to the homes with the corn. Zaldívar's people then divided into groups to collect the corn. The traditional oral Acoma narrative tells that a group attacked some Acoma women leading Acoma warriors to retaliate. The Spanish documents do not report an attack <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and say that the division of the men was a reaction to Zutacapan's plan to kill Zaldívar's party. The Acoma killed 12 of the Spaniards including Zaldívar. Five men escaped although one died from jumping over the citadel leaving four to escape with the remaining camp.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{propelling}} {{factors of}} the explosion of hip hop onto the music scene in Japan is the fashion aspect. At hip hop nightclubs, often owned and run by Africans, one would find clubbers wearing hip hop clothing typical of American youth such as oversized shirts, Tommy Hilfiger jeans and baseball caps. This macho look is even found <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>women.</b> In Tokyo you {{are most likely to}} find the latest fashions amongst the youth including burapan, the black wannabe fashion. Shibuya is a center of youth culture in Tokyo, where hip hop's growing presence can be most experienced. Here many stores offer hip hop clothing including the Bathing Ape line. Bape has been worn by Pharrell Williams and other popular hip hop artists of America. The hip hop clothing available in many of these stores can be very expensive. Hip hop fashion is now also popular in the suburbs - although some people are only following fashion trends and are not necessarily into hip hop music. Hip hop's presence can definitely be seen on the youth of Japan as they use their clothing to express themselves.|$|E

Dimitri tries to warn her about Jonathan, but she will not listen, thus putting a strain on their marriage again. While {{under the influence of}} the increasingly higher doses of drugs Jonathan gives her, Erica has sex with him. Her dependence on her supplier grows until she finally has to admit she has an addiction and checks herself into the Betty Ford Center. Once she is out, Erica and Dimitri start finding their way back to each other. This does not sit well with Jonathan. The doctor drugs Erica and tricks Dimitri into thinking they are still sleeping together. After seeing his wife in bed with another man, Dimitri files for divorce and finds comfort with an equally as devastated Maria Santos Grey. Erica has no idea what Jonathan did or why Dimitri is angry with her. Dimitri shuts her out and refuses to explain why he divorced her. Erica does not find out what happened until she and her new friends Janet Green and Skye Chandler (each of whom was wronged by Kinder) corner Jonathan and he confesses. He gets the upper hand <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> and is about to assault Erica when Dimitri comes to her rescue. Jonathan is sent to prison.|$|E

500|$|At its introduction, The Woman's Bible {{was widely}} criticized in editorials {{and from the}} pulpit. Stanton wrote that [...] "the clergy denounced it {{as the work of}} Satan..." [...] Some were put off just by its prejudicial, sacrilegious title, {{especially}} those who did not take the time to read the book. Others countered the book's more extreme conclusions one by one in public fora such as letters to the editor. One female reader of The New York Times wrote to decry The Woman's Bible for its radical statements that the Trinity was composed of [...] "a Heavenly Mother, Father, and Son", and that prayers should be addressed to an [...] "ideal Heavenly Mother". Mary Seymour Howell, a member of the Revising Committee, wrote to The New York Times in defense of the book, saying that its title could be better understood as [...] "The Woman's Commentary <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Women</b> of the Bible". Stanton countered attacks by women readers, writing [...] "the only difference between us is, we say that these degrading ideas of woman emanated from the brain of man, while the church says that they came from God." ...|$|E

500|$|A Girl in Every Port is {{considered}} by film scholars {{to be the most}} important film of Hawks's silent career. It is the first of his films to utilize many of the Hawksian themes and characters that would define much of his subsequent work. It was his first [...] "love story between two men," [...] with two men bonding over their duty, skills and careers, who consider their friendship to be more important than their relationships with women. Hawks wrote the original story and developed the screenplay with James Kevin McGuinness and Seton Miller. In the film Victor McLaglen and Robert Armstrong play two merchant seamen who are archrivals when it comes to women, with McLaglen constantly finding Armstrong's tattoo <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>women</b> that he is attempting to seduce. Eventually the two rivals become friends. Louise Brooks plays the cabaret singer with whom the two men fall in love. The film was shot from October to December 1927 and released in February 1928. It was successful in the US, and a hit in Europe where Louise Brooks was developing a cult following. In France, Henri Langlois called Hawks [...] "the Gropius of the cinema" [...] and Swiss novelist and poet Blaise Cendrars said that the film [...] "definitely marked the first appearance of contemporary cinema." [...] Hawks went over budget once again with this film, though, and his relationship with Sol Wurtzel deteriorated. After an advance screening that received positive reviews, Wurtzel told Hawks, [...] "This is the worst picture Fox has made in years." ...|$|E
