Comminution circuits are rarely designed (or even operated) to minimise energy consumption. The initial capital cost is a more common driver in their design. There is no doubt that many circuits can be made more energy-efficient by modify-ing their design or operating conditions (Valery and Jankovic, 2002). In this scenario, the optimisation of milling, especially ine to mill type 05; Michaux and many othe ze distribu the SAG mills throughput, power consumption and accor specific energy. The feed size distribution together with t characteristics (hardness, lithology, alterations, etc.) are th important factors affecting the SAG mills performance. Some oper-ations have recognised an opportunity in the relationship between feed size and mill performance and manipulate feed size to obtain efficiency improvements (Morrell and Valery, 2001). The specific energy does not just depend on <b>ore</b> <b>competence</b> but also on factors such as feed size and ball load (Morrell, 2004). The <b>ore</b> <b>competence</b> is usually characterised by pilot plant testing, lab testing an eve...|$|E
40|$|The t 10 {{relationship}} {{developed by}} Narayanan and Whiten has underpinned {{a number of}} the JKMRC models and the characterisation of <b>ore</b> <b>competence</b> through impact testing with the drop weight tester. This usefulness is based on a consistent relationship between the ho value and the overall size distribution that was noted for brittle rocks. However, like all characterisation tests this should be used only when the controlling conditions apply, which in this case is single impact breakage between two metal platens and within the range of sizes in which fragment sizes are normalizable. For any other mode of breakage the relationship should be confirmed before being applied. Soft ores or bimodal ores with widely different competence between dominant components have nontypical breakage signatures. Breakage via single point impact abrasion, compressed-bed breakage, low-energy surface breakage and incremental breakage, to name some of the other breakage modes, do not obey the general ho relationship, so their outcomes cannot be used to provide a direct comparison. Inappropriate use of the ho parameter can result in misleading conclusions about efficiency of energy use. These issues and alternative comparison techniques are presented and discussed in terms of choosing appropriate measures of efficiency of breakage, <b>ore</b> <b>competence</b> and energy required for comminution...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{characterisation}} of <b>ore</b> <b>competence</b> through controlled single particle impact can enable improved modelling of comminution process {{response to}} ore variability. A simple relationship {{is presented to}} relate the energy input and feed particle size to the breakage progeny with two fitting parameters. Previous techniques have focused either on low energy repeated impacts or high energy single impacts and have been applied over relatively small ranges of particle sizes. The method presented builds on previous understanding to unite these two disparate fields on feed particle sizes over more than two orders of magnitude. The method has been tested on 5 ores from 37. 5 mm to 250 μm over energies from 0. 02 to 3. 5 kWh/t. The resultant standard error of 3. 3 % is lower than other benchmarked models, with considerably fewer fitting parameters and no use of splining functions required. The direct calculation of appearance function for any feed size and input energy renders the proposed model well suited to incorporation in comminution process models. Further testing is required on additional ores, and further interpretation is required to obtain mechanistic explanations for the empirical fits to the model parameters...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{the effect}} of the pre-weakening of ore {{particles}} by high voltage pulses is evaluated by the percentage change of A ∗ b values between pulse-treated and untreated ore particles. The values of A ∗ b, widely used as an <b>ore</b> breakage <b>competence</b> indicator in the mineral industry, are determined from the parameters of the JKMRC breakage models. In this study a t 10 -based method was developed to predict the degree of size reduction, t 10, of pulse-treated particles from that of untreated particles broken at the same size/energy level. This method incorporates one parameter, CAb, which is equivalent to the percentage change of A ∗ b values. The t 10 -based method was validated using nine sets of comparative JK Rotary Breakage Tester data on pulse-treated and untreated ore samples over a wide range of impact specific energies and particle sizes. The t 10 -based method can be used to calculate the energy reduction due to the pre-weakening effect in the downstream comminution process. It indicates that the energy reduction by pre-weakening increases with an increase in the target product fineness and the degree of pre-weakening, and with the decrease in feed particle size...|$|R
40|$|The {{competitive}} situation within the process industry has increased {{due to the}} global industrialization. Companies operative within the industry {{are being forced to}} develop more efficient supply chains in order to sustain their competitive advantage on the market. An efficient supply chain is characterized by a combination of material and information flow where the objective is to reduce costs via reduced throughput times and material that arrives when needed. The {{purpose of this study is}} to obtain an understanding concerning factors that characterize an efficient supply chain within the mining industry with focus on reducing costs associated with material handling. Furthermore, this study aims to design a cost-effective supply chain within the mining industry. A case study is conducted at Boliden Mineral AB, where focus has been on the total supply chain from the mines to the concentrator within the Boliden area. Boliden Mineral AB is operative within the mining industry, belonging to the process industry, with their core <b>competence</b> <b>ore</b> mining where the minerals mainly consist of copper, zinc, lead, gold, and silver. The data has been gathered through interviews, observations, and written materials in both literature and from Boliden Mineral ABs intranet. This method has created conditions for the authors of this study to obtain an understanding about affecting factors on an efficient supply chain within the mining industry. The collected data has been summarized in a description of the current situation which has been the main source of information to identify the factors that negatively affect the material flow between mines and concentrator within the studied company. The most important thing for the company to take into account is to reduce the variations in the system in order to increase the availability. In order to reduce the variations this study has resulted in a template for reporting any unforeseen blockages that affects the material flow. Based on a summary of the reported data, target areas for improvement can be identified. Furthermore, a recommendation has been given about changing the shift form of ore transports. This would result in more leveled out material flows that leads to lowered storage levels due to that material is arriving when needed. The recommended shift form concludes that the total amount of trucks needed can be reduced which leads to a safer traffic situation. This recommendation would generate a cost reduction for Boliden Mineral AB because of a reduced amount of material handling and less bound capital in storage. Additionally, an efficient supply chain needs a material flow that is supported by an information flow. Thereby, the authors of this study have developed activities along with responsibilities that are needed in order to achieve efficiency in the information flow. These recommendations would generate an increased control and a capacity to manage the material flow within the company. This will result in shorter throughput times since material is arriving when needed and reduced storage levels, which will lead to a cost reduction.

40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{comminution}} energy requirements of gold and copper producing mines has been conducted to provide reliable benchmarking data {{which can be used}} to compare comminution energy consumption across different mine sites. The total gold and copper production of the mines included in the study equated to 15 % and 24 % respectively of global production and all of Australian production. The comminution energy per unit metal product has been presented in a graphical form similar to a cost curve. This simple technique allows individual mines to be ranked with respect to energy consumption and clearly displays the potential energy and cost benefits of moving down the graph into more efficient operating regimes. Assuming similar specific energy requirements for other sites, comminution of gold and copper ores can be expected to consume about 0. 2 % of global, and 1. 3 % of Australia’s electricity consumption. Efforts to reduce this figure should be aimed at the top third of consumers as they are responsible for 80 % of the total consumption. Analysis of the contribution of circuit efficiency, <b>ore</b> <b>competence,</b> grind size and ore grade showed that ore grade was the greatest determinate of specific comminution energy. Therefore, concentrating the ore via gangue rejection or grade engineering prior to grinding is likely to achieve the largest positive effect on comminution energy efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Comminution and {{classification}} circuits consume {{significant amounts}} of energy. Some estimates show that comminution processes accounts for around 40 % of the total energy consumed in mining operations and 1. 5 - 1. 8 % of the total national energy consumption in mining intensive countries such as South Africa, Australia and Canada (Tromans, 2008). Apart from recent market fluctuations the global trend is that the demand for metals and minerals is increasing (Norgate and Haque, 2010). At {{the same time the}} <b>ore</b> <b>competence</b> generally increases as material is mined at greater depths and the grade is usually lower. The consequence is that increased amounts of raw material need to be processed in larger and larger comminution devices. The task of reducing the energy consumption in this context seems daunting. The conventional comminution circuit is usually based on a crushing and screening process followed by a tumbling milling process. HPGR machines and other new devices have also become more common during the last 20 years. Independent of what type on units that are used in the circuits the global trend is that larger and larger comminution devices are manufactured and installed. With this outlook as a foundation we propose an alternative mindset to think about circuits; poly-stream comminution circuits. A general trend in product development is that technologies transform from mono-systems to poly-systems. In this paper the concept is described and exemplified in a case study including a comparison with a conventional SABC circuit. In poly-stream circuits the material streams after one or several parallel primary crushing stages are split into 5 - 20 streams by using ore sorting and classification units. Each stream handles a proportional throughput capacity and the material passes through a dedicated set of smaller comminution and classification modular units with settings optimized to target the specific properties of the material in each stream. The results of this conceptual case study suggests that smaller, instead of larger, comminution and classification units open up for modularization, higher theoretical operational availability, better plant flexibility and expansion potential. Lower mass flow streams enable the use of ore sorting with separate treatment and early rejection of gangue. It is generally also easier to achieve higher energy efficiency performance for smaller comminution, classification and separation units. There are a number of apparent challenges and problems associated with the concept. It requires new solutions for stream rerouting, sensor technology, advance control systems and advanced maintenance management systems to name a few. However, the consequent conclusion of this hypothetical concept is that perhaps the focus of research and development efforts should target material handling, sensor technology and comminution unit modularization {{in order to meet the}} challenges of future comminution circuits...|$|E
