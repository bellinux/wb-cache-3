5|$|The {{basement}} {{rooms at}} Wappocomo are located almost entirely aboveground. The house's foundation is constructed of large stone blocks, into which was crafted a large <b>open</b> <b>fireplace</b> that once exhibited a swinging iron chimney crane. The space around this large <b>open</b> <b>fireplace</b> within the mansion's basement formerly {{served as a}} kitchen, {{where most of the}} cooking and food preparation took place. Entry into the home's basement is accessible through a wide and heavy exterior door.|$|E
25|$|The Franklin Stove, {{also known}} as the {{circulating}} stove, is a metal-lined fireplace with baffles in the rear to improve the airflow, providing more heat and less smoke than an ordinary <b>open</b> <b>fireplace.</b> The stove became very popular throughout the Thirteen Colonies and gradually replaced open fireplaces. The Franklin stove was invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1742.|$|E
25|$|Enclosing a fire also {{prevents}} {{air from}} being sucked {{from the room}} into the chimney. This can represent a significant loss of heat as an <b>open</b> <b>fireplace</b> can pull away many cubic metres of heated air per hour. Efficiency is generally regarded as the maximum heat output of a stove or fire, and is usually referred to by manufacturers as the difference between heat to the room and heat lost up the chimney.|$|E

25|$|In rural areas, {{the older}} {{technology}} using coal or wood stoves or even brick-and-mortar <b>open</b> <b>fireplaces</b> remained common throughout. Gas and water pipes were first {{installed in the}} big cities; small villages were connected only much later.|$|R
25|$|The Tower was {{originally}} the power station when the railway was built {{and now has}} two parts: the tower itself and the Lötschberghaus (sleeping building). In total there is accommodation for 57 people - four rooms with 12 beds in the Lötschberghaus and a newly renovated room with nine beds in the tower. Facilities include full toilet and shower facilities for boys and girls, a fully equipped electric kitchen and a big living room with an <b>open</b> <b>fireplace</b> and balcony.|$|E
500|$|Two of the 100 listed {{buildings}} and structures in the Borough of Crawley are in Southgate. [...] Goffs Manor, in Goffs Park, is a Grade II-listed 16th-century farmhouse which is now a restaurant and pub. [...] Before its conversion, actor Peter Vaughan owned and lived in it. [...] The building is timber-framed, as many Crawley houses of the time were, although little of this is now visible. [...] The upper floor is hung with red tiles. [...] The roof is made of slabs of Horsham Stone. [...] An original <b>open</b> <b>fireplace</b> remains inside. [...] The signal box next to the level crossing on Crawley High Street, another Grade II-listed building, is just on the Southgate side of the railway line. [...] It was built in about 1860 and has a hipped roof.|$|E
500|$|Fort Dansborg {{is located}} in the {{southern}} part of Tharangambadi, located [...] from the state capital Chennai. It is built in Danish style, characterized by large halls, columned structures, high ceilings and projecting drapery. The length of the fort in the side facing the sea is [...] and the width is about [...] The fort is trapezoidal in shape with three rooms in the left wing, originally used as the governor's residence, a kitchen with an <b>open</b> <b>fireplace</b> and chimney in the top left hand corner, and a church room, now a museum, located in the centre of the building. The original rectory and the northern part of it, which are now the store rooms, are located in the right wing. The corner room on the right side was the residence of the commercial director. In modern times, it is used as a store room. The core of the building is made of brick. The main door of the fort faces north, while an additional door faces the east. The second storey of the fort has a set of guard rooms. The staircase leading to it are built with bricks. The central part of the fort has four camel hump shaped domes. The central pillar of the hall holds the entire weight of the domes.|$|E

50|$|The inn is {{modelled}} on its namesake, the Smokehouse in Beck Row, Mildenhall, England, the United Kingdom. The {{interior is}} reminiscent of a typical English country house with <b>open</b> <b>fireplaces</b> and wood-panelled walls. Outside, the landscape would pass for an authentic English garden.|$|R
50|$|From the 1890s to {{the time}} of World War Two, most Rockhampton houses also possessed spacious living areas with dining and sitting rooms, {{separated}} by open archways that were often bordered with intricate fretwork designs produced by local skilled craftsmen. In this period very few houses built had <b>open</b> <b>fireplaces</b> and chimneys, although Clancholla exhibits a centrally placed chimney.|$|R
2500|$|All the {{first-class}} public rooms, and the en-suite staterooms of {{the upper}} deck, were generally heavily panelled, in oak, satinwood or mahogany; and thickly carpeted. Velvet curtains hung aside the windows and portholes, while the furniture was richly upholstered in matching design. The predominant style was Art Nouveau, although other styles were also in use, such as [...] "French Renaissance" [...] which {{was applied to the}} forward first-class entrance hall, whilst the 1st class smoking room was in [...] "Elizabethan style", comprising heavy oak panels surrounding the first <b>open</b> <b>fireplace</b> ever to be used aboard a passenger liner.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{at the end}} of the Diele {{near the}} back of the farmhouse, was the Flett, an open kitchen and dining area that took up the entire width of the house. The <b>open</b> <b>fireplace,</b> about 1.5 metres across, was located in the middle of the Flett and was ringed with fieldstones. It was not like a hearth in other regions. Many types of cooking were not {{possible}} in this environment (*). Pots had to be high enough, in effect cauldrons, and were hung over the fire with pothooks attached to a wooden frame (Rahmen) hanging over the fireplace, often decorated with horses heads. At night an iron grid was pulled over the fire to prevent sparks, a practice known by the English term curfew. Well-to-do families had a candle arch (Schwibbogen) of masonry instead of a wooden frame. Smoke escaped through an opening in the roof on the gable, the Uhlenloch (also Eulenloch, literally: [...] "owl hole"). The <b>open</b> <b>fireplace</b> meant that such buildings were considered as a particular fire risk by early fire insurance firms. The open fire also provided some heat to the stalls and living quarters of the Hallenhaus. In this way, hay stored in the loft could be dried out and protected from vermin by the smoke. When the farmer's family and farm hands gathered for meal times, the best places were between the fireplace and the rooms. Because there was no partition between Diele and loft, winter temperatures in the Flett never rose above 12°C.|$|E
2500|$|MSU {{provides}} three on-campus dining centers {{offering an}} all-you-can-eat cafeteria format. The oldest and busiest is Blair-Shannon Dining Hall (located {{on the first}} floor of Blair-Shannon House) which employs a staff of 60 and serves over 19,000 meals per week during the fall and spring semesters. Garst Dining Center is located between Hammons House and Hutchens House. [...] Along with traditional fare and hours, Garst also offers [...] "after hours" [...] dining with a reduced menu from 9:00–11:00PM during the fall semester. [...] After hours dining switches to Blair-Shannon for the second half of the year. [...] Kentwood Dining Center is located in the historic Kentwood Hall. Smallest of the on-campus dining centers, Kentwood was remodeled in 2002, and provides a more traditional atmosphere, with exposed brick walls and an <b>open</b> <b>fireplace.</b>|$|E
50|$|County School {{station was}} {{equipped}} with three platforms, two platform buildings, a signal box and a small coal yard.

The station was also provided with a large orchard on land provided for sidings that were never required.|$|R
50|$|The George at Nunney Inn {{is close}} to the church and {{opposite}} Nunney Castle. It dates from the mid-18th century. Since that time it has been much extended and is now a 10 bedroom hotel with holiday cottages.

50|$|Today, the Hall {{with its}} {{elaborate}} timber roof survives {{as well as}} the kitchen—possibly the most complete medieval kitchen in England. The kitchen still contains many original features, including two <b>open</b> <b>fireplaces,</b> each large enough to roast an ox, and two bread ovens served by a third chimney. The Hall is over five hundred years old {{and one of the best}} preserved medieval manor houses in England.|$|R
2500|$|The burn {{temperature}} in modern stoves can increase {{to the point}} where secondary and complete combustion of the fuel takes place. A properly fired masonry heater has little or no particulate pollution in the exhaust and does not contribute to the buildup of creosote in the heater flues or the chimney. Some stoves achieve as little as 1 to 4grams per hour. This is roughly 90% less smoke than older stoves, and equates to nearly zero visible smoke from the chimney. This is largely achieved through causing the maximum amount of material to combust, which results in a net efficiency of 60 to 70% as contrasted to less than 30% for an <b>open</b> <b>fireplace.</b> (Net efficiency is the amount of heat energy transferred to the room compared to the amount contained in the wood, minus any amount central heating must work to compensate for airflow problems.) ...|$|E

50|$|Blink Bonnie, {{also known}} as Robertson House, is a {{historic}} plantation house located near Ridgeway, Fairfield County, South Carolina. It was built in 1822, and is a 1-½ story clapboard frame house on a brick foundation. It features a one-story, hipped roof front porch supported by six double capped square columns. The house has a one-story addition and an old two-room brick kitchen with large <b>open</b> <b>fireplaces,</b> ovens and warmers.|$|R
60|$|Both {{living room}} and {{sleeping}} room were arranged so that the Painted Desert could be seen from one window, {{and on the other}} side the whole of the San Francisco Mountains. Both rooms were to have <b>open</b> <b>fireplaces.</b> Carley's idea was for service and durability. She thought of comfort in the severe winters of that high latitude, but elegance and luxury had no more significance in her life.|$|R
50|$|Unlike most megabats {{endemic to}} the Comoros Islands, R. obliviosus thrives in captivity {{and has been}} a staple in the North American and Australian pet trades since the late 1990s. Because its care {{requirements}} are relatively minimal, their care is simple and low-cost. The average suburban household (fitted with aluminum window screens) serves as an excellent environment for these large bats, so long as ceiling fans and <b>open</b> <b>fireplaces</b> are responsibly maintained.|$|R

50|$|Some of the {{interior}} wood panelling is nineteenth century, some older, perhaps original. The vaulted cellars are thought {{to belong to a}} 13th-century Carmelite monastery which once occupied the site. The entrance to this pub is situated in a narrow alleyway and is very unassuming, yet once inside visitors will realise that the pub occupies a lot of floor space and has numerous bars and gloomy rooms. In winter, <b>open</b> <b>fireplaces</b> are used to keep {{the interior}} warm. In the bar room are posted plaques showing famous people who were regulars.|$|R
6000|$|The {{house is}} a large, three-story affair, with crossed gables, and a large semicircular veranda at one end.
