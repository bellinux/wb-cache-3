5000|$|Attention {{regarding}} DDC's use of VDM in compiler design led {{to interest}} from other computer manufacturers and sales {{were made of}} {{what became known as}} the DDC OEM Compiler Kit. [...] The compiler system offered two points for retargeting, a high-level tree-structured intermediate language and a sequence of instructions for an abstract stack machine; the latter meant shorter project times but usually not the most optimized generated code. [...] (The abstract stack-based virtual machine was also worked on by Christian Rovsing; there was also some idea of possibly implementing it in hardware or firmware.) The first such <b>OEM</b> <b>sale</b> was to Nokia, for rehosting on the Nokia MPS 10. [...] The second, with a contract made in February 1984, was with Honeywell Information Systems in Boston. The compiler was thus rehosted and retargeted to the Honeywell DPS6 and validated in November 1984.|$|R

50|$|In an {{automotive}} context, BTO is {{a demand}} driven production approach where {{a product is}} scheduled and built {{in response to a}} confirmed order received for it from a final customer. The final customer refers to a known individual owner and excludes all orders by the original equipment manufacturer (<b>OEM),</b> national <b>sales</b> companies (NSC), dealers or point of sales, bulk orders or other intermediaries in the supply chain. BTO excludes the order amendment function, whereby forecast orders in the pipeline are amended to customer requirements, as this is seen as another level of sophistication for a build to stock (BTS) system (also known as build to forecast (BTF)).|$|R

STB Systems was one of the larger graphics card manufacturers at the time; the intent was for 3dfx to start manufacturing, marketing, and selling its own graphics cards, rather than functioning only as an OEM supplier. STB was obviously intended to give 3dfx access to that company's considerable <b>OEM</b> resources and <b>sales</b> channels, but the intended benefits of the acquisition never materialized. The two corporations were vastly different entities, with different cultures and structures, and they never integrated smoothly.|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the concept of}} quality risk in outsourcing. Recent trends in outsourcing extend a contract manufacturer's (CM's) responsibility to several functional areas, such as {{research and development and}} design in addition to manufacturing. This trend enables an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) to focus on sales and pricing of its product. However, increasing CM responsibilities also suggest that the OEM's product quality is mainly determined by its CM. We identify two factors that cause quality risk in this Outsourcing relationship. First, the CM and the OEM {{may not be able to}} contract on quality; second, the OEM may not know the cost of quality to the CM. We characterize the effects of these two quality risk factors on the firms' profits and on the resulting product quality. We determine how the OEM's pricing strategy affects quality risk. We show, for example, that the effect of noncontractible quality is higher than the effect of private quality cost information when the <b>OEM</b> sets the <b>sales</b> price after observing the product's quality. We also show that committing to a sales price mitigates the adverse effect of quality risk. To obtain these results, we develop and analyze a three-stage decision model. This model is also used to understand the impact of recent information technologies on profits and product quality. For example, we provide a decision tree that an OEM can use in deciding whether to invest in an enterprise-wide quality management system that enables accounting of quality-related activities across the supply chain...|$|R

Pack did not reach as many retail consumers as the operating system itself (it was mainly advertised for its non-Internet-related add-ons such as themes and better disk compression) but was usually included in pre-installed (<b>OEM)</b> <b>sales,</b> and at the time of Windows 95's release, the web was being browsed mainly with a variety of early web browsers such as NCSA Mosaic and Netscape Navigator (promoted by products such as Internet in a Box).|$|E
50|$|In June 1982 Cole hired Rod Turner as the {{director}} of <b>OEM</b> <b>sales</b> for Ashton-Tate. In a few weeks Turner solved a sales commission plan issue, that had been bothering George Tate for some time, with the top performing salesperson (Barbara Weingarten, now Guerra), and Tate and Cole promoted Turner to be Vice President of world-wide sales three weeks after his initial hire. Turner was approximately the 12th employee of Ashton Tate. Since the company was truly boot-strapped, using no external venture capital, the founders did not make a practice of hiring experienced veterans, and most of the team at Ashton-Tate were young and enthusiastic, but inexperienced. Jim Taylor was responsible for product management in the early days, and worked closely with Wayne Ratliff and the other key developers on dBASE II. In 1982 Perry Lawrence and Nelson Tso were the two developers who were employed at Ashton-Tate, while Wayne Ratliff employed Jeb Long from his royalty stream.|$|E

5000|$|Data General {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{minicomputer}} firms from the late 1960s. Three of the four founders were former employees of Digital Equipment Corporation. Their first product, the Data General Nova, was a 16-bit minicomputer. This used their own operating system, Data General RDOS (DG/RDOS), and in conjunction with programming languages like [...] "Data General Business Basic" [...] they provided a multi-user operating system with record locking and built-in databases far ahead of many contemporary systems. The Nova was followed by the Supernova and Eclipse product lines, all of which were used in many applications for the next two decades. The company employed an original equipment manufacturer (<b>OEM)</b> <b>sales</b> strategy to sell to third parties who incorporated Data General computers into the OEM's specific product lines. A series of missteps in the 1980s, including missing the advance of microcomputers despite the launch of the microNOVA in 1977, and the Data General-One portable computer in 1984, led to a decline in the company's market share. The company did continue into the 1990s, however, and was eventually acquired by EMC Corporation in 2002.|$|E
5000|$|While {{these new}} {{features}} and security improvements have garnered positive reviews, Vista {{has also been}} the target of much criticism and negative press. Criticism of Windows Vista has targeted its high system requirements, its more restrictive licensing terms, the inclusion of a number of, then, new DRM technologies aimed at restricting the copying of protected digital media, lack of compatibility with some pre-Vista hardware and software, longer boot time, and the number of authorization prompts for User Account Control. As a result of these and other issues, Windows Vista had seen initial adoption and satisfaction rates lower than Windows XP. However, with an estimated 330 million Internet users as of January 2009, it had been announced that Vista usage had surpassed Microsoft's pre-launch two-year-out expectations of achieving 200 million users.At the release of Windows 7 (October 2009), Windows Vista (with approximately 400 million Internet users) was the second most widely used operating system on the Internet with an approximately 19% market share, the most widely used being Windows XP with an approximately 63% market share. In May 2010, Windows Vista's market share had an estimated range from 15% to 26%. [...] On 22 October 2010, Microsoft ceased sales of retail copies of Windows Vista, and the <b>OEM</b> <b>sales</b> for Vista ceased a year later.

40|$|With growing {{popularity}} for commercial air travel and aerial military operations comes {{an increase in}} demand for innovative, technological solutions of aircraft system components. As <b>OEM</b> <b>sales</b> of these components rise, this creates a burden on the aftermarket {{side of the business}} when these parts and systems require service in order to continue functioning properly. Parker Aerospace, Fluid Systems Division, and its Product Support Team are experiencing this growth burden and want to reconfigure necessary means within the layout to succeed in accommodating new program areas on the aftermarket side. During this process, cost reduction opportunities will be explored and a systematic approach to facility design will be used. In this approach, the departments are initially defined before the relationships between them are to be analyzed. Space requirements are also recorded. Once these steps are complete, alternative layouts are constructed and analyzed before a final layout is chosen. This systematic approach provides a fully analyzed facility design, taking into consideration the needs of the customer, the constraints of the company, and the total cost of implementation. Moreover, the increase in revenue due to new program areas along with cost savings provided by the layout is presented to show the economic justification of the facility redesign. Once the required steps of the facilities systematic approach are complete, the appropriate upper management at Parker Fluid Systems Division must be convinced before signing off on all necessary paperwork and eventually becoming implemented...|$|E
