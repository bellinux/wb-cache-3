5|$|Air {{contains}} water vapor, and {{the amount}} of water in a given mass <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> air, known as the mixing ratio, is measured in grams of water per kilogram <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> air (g/kg). The amount of moisture in air is also commonly reported as relative humidity; which is the percentage of the total water vapor air can hold at a particular air temperature. How much water vapor a parcel of air can contain before it becomes saturated (100%relative humidity) and forms into a cloud (a group of visible and tiny water and ice particles suspended above the Earth's surface) depends on its temperature. Warmer air can contain more water vapor than cooler air before becoming saturated. Therefore, one way to saturate a parcel of air is to cool it. The dew point is the temperature to which a parcel must be cooled in order to become saturated.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to analyse the impact <b>of</b> parameters and <b>drying</b> method on the increase of the volume <b>of</b> <b>dried</b> apple slices and cubes during their rehydration. Ligol apples (cut into 3 and 10 mm slices and 10 mm cubes) were dried with the following meth-ods: natural convection (temperature <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> 60 ºC), forced convec-tion (a tunnel <b>drier,</b> parameters <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> air: 50, 60, 70 ºC and 0, 5, 2 ms- 1), fluid drying (60 ºC and 6 ms- 1). Dried fruit were rehydrated in the distilled water of 20 ºC temperature. Determination of volume was carried out with an uplift pressure method in petroleum ether. Tests proved the impact <b>of</b> ground <b>dried</b> particles and the impact <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> method on the increase of the volume <b>of</b> <b>dried</b> apples during their rehydration.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new model for {{thermodynamic}} analysis, in terms of exergy, <b>of</b> a <b>drying</b> process. Exergy efficiencies are derived as functions of heat and mass transfer parameters. An illustrative example is considered to verify the present model and to illustrate {{the applicability of the}} model to actual drying processes at different drying air temperatures, specific exergies <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> air, exergy differences of inlet and outlet products, product weights, moisture contents <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> air, and humidity ratios <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> air. As a result, this work is intended not only to demonstrate the usefulness of exergy analysis in thermodynamic assessments <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> processes, but also to provide insights into their performances and efficiencies. It is believed that the present model should be useful to people seeking (i) to optimize the design <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> systems and their components and (ii) to identify appropriate applications and optimal configurations for drying systems.

5|$|After {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression {{turned to a}} northwest motion before resuming a track to the west-northwest. On May7 it intensified into a deep depression, and though its winds had increased, the structure became disorganized as the center became exposed from the thunderstorm activity. The convection waned, due to the influence <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> air from the Arabian Peninsula, {{as well as from}} wind shear. As a result, the IMD downgraded it to depression status early on May8. However, later in the day, convection redeveloped over the western half of the circulation, and it again reached deep depression status, about 830km (515mi) southeast of Oman.|$|E
5|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Gulf of Oman, the cyclone briefly re-intensified slightly, possibly {{due to the}} warm waters.

On June 6, the cyclone turned to the north-northwest, and later that day the JTWC downgraded Gonu to tropical storm status. The IMD followed suit by downgrading Gonu to severe cyclonic storm status and later to cyclonic storm status early on June 7. Gonu crossed the Makran coast in Iran six hours later and the IMD stopped issuing advisories on the cyclone. This made it the first tropical cyclone on record to hit the country since 1898.

5|$|At {{the time}} of Erika's classification, {{forecast}} models diverged significantly on the potential future of Erika. Statistical guidance and the HWRF depicted a hurricane while the ECMWF and GFS showed a weaker system due to increasing wind shear. The models that intensified the storm indicated a more northerly track while those that kept it weaker had the system continuing along a westward course. Accordingly, the NHC noted low confidence in their five-day forecast for Erika. This uncertainty ultimately reflected in above-average forecast errors when compared to all tropical cyclones, but roughly average for weak, poorly organized systems. Throughout August25 and into early August26, the convective organization of Erika fluctuated due to wind shear and entrainment <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> air, periodically leaving the center of circulation devoid of convection.|$|E
