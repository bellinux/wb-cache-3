5|$|Horses {{were first}} {{reported}} in the Kaimanawa Range in 1876, although the first horses had been brought into New Zealand in 1814. The feral herds grew as horses escaped and were released from sheep stations and cavalry bases. Members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> were recaptured by locals for use as riding horses, {{as well as being}} caught for their meat, hair and hides. The herd declined as large scale farming and forestry operations encroached on their ranges, and only around 174 horses were known to exist by 1979. The Kaimanawa herd was protected by the New Zealand government in 1981, and there were 1,576 horses in the herd by 1994. A small, mostly unmanaged population also exists on the Aupouri Peninsula at the northern tip of the North Island. Roundups have been carried out annually since 1993 to manage the size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd,</b> removing around 2,800 horses altogether. The Kaimanawa population is listed as a herd of special genetic value by the United Nations' Food and Agricultural Organization, and several studies have been conducted on the herd dynamics and habits of the breed.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, the NPS {{began the}} process of {{developing}} a management plan for the Cumberland Island horse. After compiling information, they released a draft environmental assessment in early 1996 and began taking public comment on a potential management plan. Public opinion was severely divided, with environmentalists approving of the management plan, which would have likely resulted in the reduction or removal <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd,</b> and animal rights activists and island residents protesting the plan. However, before a plan could be implemented, US Representative Jack Kingston included a provision in a federal appropriations bill that prevented any management of the horses. Kingston made the change to the bill after touring the island, but without consultation with the NPS. He initially claimed that he personally did not see significant damage to the island from the horses, and that the herd size had decreased. However, upon later questioning, he refused to expand upon his observations of the damage to the island. The provision expired in 1997, but effectively halted momentum toward a park management plan. The study published in 2000 recommended a management strategy that reduced herd populations to environmentally-recommended sizes through a combination of off-island adoption to private owners and contraceptives. The researchers recommended that contraceptive use be focused on the female members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd,</b> due to the high numbers of bachelor stallions.|$|E

Since then, few new horses have been introduced to the island, though four Arabians were introduced in the early 1990s {{in the hopes of}} diversifying and bettering the existing population. Since 1981, the NPS has been monitoring the horses and tracking their impact on the environment. In 1991, an outbreak of eastern equine encephalitis killed about 40 horses, or approximately 18% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd.</b> The population on Cumberland Island is one of seven feral horse herds on US barrier islands.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, {{the park}} sold off {{a large number}} of horses, {{including}} herd stallions, and released several stallions with outside bloodlines into the herds. At this point, brothers Leo and Frank Kuntz began purchasing the horses with the aim of preserving the breed, and founded the Nokota Horse Conservancy in 1999, later beginning a breed registry through the same organization. Later, a second, short-lived, registry was begun by another organization in Minnesota. In 2009, the North Dakota Badlands Horse Registry was created, which registers the slightly different type of horses which have been removed from the park in recent years. Today, the park conducts regular thinning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> to keep numbers between 70 and 110, and the excess horses are sold off.|$|E

5|$|Historically, Egyptian breeders {{imported}} horses bred in {{the deserts}} of Palestine and the Arabian peninsula {{as the source of}} their foundation bloodstock. By the time that the Ottoman Empire dominated Egypt, the political elites of the region still recognized the need for quality bloodstock for both war and for horse racing, and some continued to return to the deserts to obtain pure-blooded Arabians. One of the most famous was Muhammad Ali of Egypt, also known as Muhammad Ali Pasha, who established an extensive stud farm in the 19th century. After his death, some of his stock was bred on by Abbas I of Egypt, also known as Abbas Pasha. However, after Abbas Pasha was assassinated in 1854, his heir, El Hami Pasha, sold most of his horses, often for crossbreeding, and gave away many others as diplomatic gifts. A remnant <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> was obtained by Ali Pasha Sherif, who then went back to the desert to bring in new bloodstock. At its peak, the stud of Ali Pasha Sherif had over 400 purebred Arabians. Unfortunately, an epidemic of African horse sickness in the 1870s that killed thousands of horses throughout Egypt decimated much of his herd, wiping out several irreplaceable bloodlines. Late in his life, he sold several horses to Wilfred and Lady Anne Blunt, who exported them to Crabbet Park Stud in England. After his death, Lady Anne was also able to gather many remaining horses at her Sheykh Obeyd stud.|$|E

Within-herd prevalence ranged from 4 to 88 %, with the prevalence in most herds being greater than 10 %. A large diversity of Salmonella serotypes was found, with Typhimurium, 4,[5], 12 :i: 2, and Rissen being the most prevalent. Two or more serotypes coexisted in 73 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herds.</b> Salmonella Typhimurium was present in 68 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herds.</b> Most (82 %) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Salmonella isolates belonged to serogroups targeted by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests for pig salmonellosis. Resistance {{to at least one}} antimicrobial agent was detected in 73 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> strains, and one or more resistant strains were recovered from pigs in 93 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herds.</b> Antimicrobial agent resistance (AR) was more frequent among the most prevalent than it was among the rarer serotypes.

Nasal samples (60 – 80 pigs per herd) were collected from 38 herds; in 20 herds, environmental samples were collected as well. Ten MRSA-positive <b>herds</b> (based on <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> nasal swabs of 10 individual pigs per herd) from a prior study were included in <b>the</b> data analysis. <b>Herds</b> were classified as MRSA positive if at least one sample tested positive. <b>The</b> 48 <b>herds</b> were part of 14 complete (40 herds) and 4 incomplete (8 herds) pig production chains. Fifty-six percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herds</b> were classified as MRSA positive.

Resistance against tetracycline, erythromycin and clindamycin was found in 100, 74 and 76 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isolates, respectively. Seventy-nine percent of herds with a MRSA-positive supplier of pigs were MRSA positive, whereas 23 % of herds with a MRSA-negative supplier were MRSA positive (OR = 10. 8; 95 % CI: 1. 5 – 110. 1; P = 0. 011). <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> entirely MRSA-positive and MRSA-negative chains and the strong association between <b>the</b> MRSA status <b>of</b> <b>herds</b> and their suppliers illustrates a large risk associated with purchasing pigs from MRSA-positive herds; a top-down strategy for future control programs is, therefore, a basic requirement.

25|$|This {{method of}} {{insemination}} quickly gained popularity among dairy producers for several reasons. Dairy bulls are notoriously dangerous {{to keep on}} the average dairy facility. AI also {{makes it possible to}} speed the genetic improvement of the dairy herd because every dairy farmer has access to sperm from genetically superior sires. Additionally, AI has been shown to reduce spread of venereal diseases within herd that would ultimately lead to fertility problems. Many producers also find it to be more economical than keeping a bull. On the other hand, AI does require more intensive reproductive management <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>herd</b> as well as more time and expertise. Detection of estrus, becomes reliant on observation in the absence of bulls. It takes considerable expertise to properly inseminate a cow and high quality sperm is valuable. Ultimately, because dairy production was already a management intensive industry the disadvantages are dwarfed by the advantages of the AI for many dairy producers.|$|E
