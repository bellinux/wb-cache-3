5|$|On August 29th 2005, flood {{walls and}} levees catastrophically failed {{throughout}} the metro area. Many collapsed well below design thresholds (17th Street and London Canals). Others collapsed {{after a brief}} period of <b>overtopping</b> (Industrial Canal) caused “scouring” or erosion of the earthen levee walls. In eastern New Orleans, levees along the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway failed in several places because they were built with sand and erodible materials instead of clay, an obvious construction flaw.|$|E

25|$|The primary {{mechanisms}} of failure at the 17th Street Canal, London Avenue Canal and Industrial Canal (east side north) were improper {{design of the}} canal floodwalls. The failure mechanism for the Industrial Canal (east side south and west side) was <b>overtopping</b> of levees and floodwalls by the storm surge. The primary mechanism of failure for levees protecting eastern New Orleans was the existence of sand in 10% of places instead of thick Louisiana clay. The primary mechanism of failure for the levees protecting St. Bernard Parish was <b>overtopping</b> due to negligent maintenance of the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet, a navigation channel, built and maintained by the Corps of Engineers.|$|E
40|$|The {{emphasis}} of this thesis {{is on the}} derivation of original results or improvement to the available results {{in order to obtain}} a practical design methodology for <b>overtopped</b> rockfill dams. The work comprised of experiments in a large hydraulic flume, and extensive theoretical development of design aspects. A non-linear finite element analysis for non-Darcy flow in dams has also been formulated. The important contributions of the thesis are listed as follows: I. Non-Darcy seepage flow. (1) Development of a general relationship between the Reynolds number and the friction coefficient for seepage in rockfill; (2) Development of a general relationship between the hydraulic gradient and the velocity of seepage flow in rockfill; (3) Investigation of the difference between all the available formulae for non-Darcy flow by the computer simulation with wide range of porosity and size of rockfill. Comparisons between the simulated results of available formulae and the available prototype data have also been undertaken. (4) Determination of the hydraulics mean radius of rockfill material by empirical relationship; (5) Estimation of the seepage discharge through a rockfill dam without numerical modelling. II. Numerical modelling of non-Darcy seepage flow. (1) Development of a high-accuracy finite element method to model the non-Darcy seepage field within a flowthrough and <b>overtopped</b> rockfill dam. III. Stability analysis and design methodology for flowthrough and <b>overtopped</b> rockfill dams. (1) Development of a formula for the design of the external layer comprising of large-size particles at the downstream slope of a flowthrough and <b>overtopped</b> flow rockfill dam; (2) Development of a formula for the design of mesh protection at the downstream slope of a flowthrough and <b>overtopped</b> rockfill dam; (3) Development of a formula for the design of steel bars protected at the downstream slope of a flowthrough and <b>overtopped</b> rockfill dam; (4) Development of a practical design methodology which applies to small flowthrough and <b>overtopped</b> rockfill dams. IV. Behaviour of forces acting on the downstream slope. (1) Investigation of the stochastic and statistical behaviour of the forces acting on the force panels installed at the downstream slope in a model flowthrough and <b>overtopped</b> rockfill dam. V. Theoretical solution of 1 -D seepage flow in <b>overtopped</b> rockfill. (1) Development of a theoretical solution for the seepage flow at the transition zone in an <b>overtopped</b> rockfill dam...|$|R

50|$|On July 1 the Corps of Engineers {{reported}} that every non-federal levee from Rulo to Wolcott, Kansas, in Wyandotte County, Kansas, {{on both sides}} of the river were either <b>overtopped</b> or breached. Included in the overtoppings was Kansas Department of Corrections land below the Lansing Correctional Facility at Lansing, Kansas. Another report indicated that the only <b>overtopped</b> federal levee was the one at Fort Leavenworth by Sherman Army Airfield.|$|R
25|$|During {{this period}} the Missoula Floods {{periodically}} discharged {{large volumes of}} water, some of which reached Upper Crab Creek by <b>overtopping</b> the divide between the Columbia drainage and the Crab Creek drainage, and some diverted into the Columbia River to enter Crab Creek at Moses Lake. As a result, substantial coulees and scablands were created in the Upper Crab Creek drainage, and the drainage below the Potholes Reservoir is overlarge (i.e., the channel sizes could contain a substantially larger river than currently flows there).|$|E
25|$|According to a {{study by}} the National Academy of Engineering and the National Research Council, levees and floodwalls {{surrounding}} New Orleans—no matter how large or sturdy—cannot provide absolute protection against <b>overtopping</b> or failure in extreme events. Levees and floodwalls should be viewed as a way to reduce risks from hurricanes and storm surges, not as measures that completely eliminate risk. For structures in hazardous areas and residents who do not relocate, the committee recommended major floodproofing measures—such as elevating the first floor of buildings to at least the 100-year flood level.|$|E
25|$|Following an {{inspection}} in 2006 and further investigations {{in the years}} that followed, it was decided that maintenance works were needed to the eastern dam. The threats to the dam included internal erosion and <b>overtopping</b> of the dam during a storm event.Lichfield District Council appointed Galliford Try as principal contractor for works to start in December 2010. In May 2011 ownership of the reservoir passed to Staffordshire County Council to ensure successful completion of the works. The county council maintained the principal contractor and appointed civil engineers, URS to complete the works.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 31, in a {{farmhouse}} on a hill just above the South Fork Dam, Elias Unger, president of the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club, awoke {{to the sight of}} Lake Conemaugh swollen after a night-long heavy rainfall. Unger ran outside in the still-pouring rain to assess the situation and saw that the water was nearly cresting the dam. He quickly assembled a group of men to save the face of the dam by trying to unclog the spillway; it was blocked by the broken fish trap and debris caused by the swollen waterline. Other men tried digging a ditch {{at the other end of}} the dam, on the western abutment which was lower than the dam crest. The idea was to let more water out of the lake to try to prevent <b>overtopping</b> of the crest, but without success. Most remained on top of the dam, some plowing earth to raise it, while others tried to pile mud and rock on the face to save the eroding wall.|$|E
25|$|During November {{a series}} of floods {{affected}} many parts of Britain. On 22 November a man died after his car was washed down a flooded brook in Chew Stoke, Somerset and trapped against a small bridge. A 26-year-old man was also killed as his car overturned in torrential rain in Devon. In Sonning, Berkshire a 91-year-old was apparently witnessed to have gone swimming in the flooded Thames and was missing, feared dead. A Downing Street spokesman said that 300 properties were flooded in 24 hours in England and Wales on 22 November. Heavy rains led to <b>overtopping</b> of the Grand Western Canal near to Halberton, Devon forcing homes to be evacuated as the canal wall breached, spilling the canal contents on lower land. The Environment Agency and Police via the media stressed that motorists should take great care when driving through flood waters after {{a series of}} fatalities involving motorists during the flooding of 2012. In Welney, Norfolk a man who posted a video of driving a 4x4 vehicle through deep floodwaters along the closed A1101 road online, was branded as irresponsible and dangerous by Norfolk Police. While Cambridgeshire Police said that drivers who drove through floods and got stuck could face prosecution, after several vehicles were stranded in floodwaters.|$|E

500|$|The {{longevity}} of the dams {{and their ability}} to hold Colorado River water in large lakes has been debated. In one hypothesis water from the Colorado River backed up behind the dams in large lakes that extended as far as Moab, Utah. Dams were overtopped in short time; those that were [...] high were overtopped by their lakes in 2to17days. At the same time, sediment filled the lakes behind the dams. Sediment would fill a lake behind a -high dam in 10.33 months, filled a lake behind an -high dam in 345years, and filled the lake behind the tallest dam in 3000years. Cascades of water flowed over a dam while waterfalls migrated up-river along it. Most lava dams lasted for around 10,000 to 20,000 years. However others have proposed that the lava dams were much more ephemeral and failed catastrophically before <b>overtopping.</b> In this model dams would fail due to fluid flow through fractures in the dams and around dam abutments, through permeable river deposits and alluvium.|$|E
500|$|The {{rainfall}} {{also caused}} Venustiano Carranza Dam in Coahuila to fill completely; the large water {{pressure in the}} dam forced the dam's gates shut, and cranes were employed to open them. The rest of the gates were unable to be opened {{due to lack of}} electrical power, sparking fears of a potential dam <b>overtopping</b> or rupture. The municipality of Anáhuac in Nuevo León was evacuated after reports early on July6 that the dam had overtopped; Anáhuac's municipal president stated that the flood could cause the [...] "total destruction" [...] of the city. On July7, as water releases from the dam were increased to , the town was reported to be [...] underwater, with more discharge expected. Personnel from the Mexican Army and the city's prison population were evacuated from Anáhuac that same day. [...] In San Luis Potosí, the rainfall from Alex was beneficial, as it caused increases in dam water levels of up to 20% in very dry areas.|$|E
500|$|Devon County Council {{agreed to}} pay for repairs to the canal, in time for its 200th anniversary and on 7 July 2013, a 3 million pound project to repair the breach, began with an {{official}} turf cutting. The repairs included rebuilding the failed embankment and raising the level {{to reduce the risk}} of <b>overtopping</b> in the future, and further improvements to water management.The canal was lined with an impermeable material along the length of the embankment. In addition a water level monitoring and alarm system has been installed. This system has sensors in Tiverton and Burlescombe and alerts the canal rangers and Devon County Council if the levels become exceptionally high. Refilling of the breached section began on 4 March 2014 using a [...] sluice gate at Rock Bridge which gradually filled the empty section and the canal was officially re-opened on 19 March 2014 by chairman of Devon County Council Councillor Bernard Hughes.

500|$|Flooding in Maryland largely {{occurred}} {{along the}} Potomac River, primarily {{along the north}} branch, as well as downstream after draining floodwaters from Virginia and West Virginia. Two gauging stations recorded new discharge records, although the peak of [...] at Paw Paw was slightly less than the record set in 1936. There was also flooding along the Youghiogheny River, which had a peak discharge of [...] at Oakland, just below the record set in 1941. The floods along the Potomac swept up debris and animals. In Georgetown in Washington, D.C., the floods reached within [...] of <b>overtopping</b> the lock, thus preventing significant flooding in the nation's capital, although floodwaters reached [...] deep in portions of the neighborhood. Levels along the Potomac in Washington were the third highest on record. Officials closed the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, and Jefferson Memorial for two days due to fears of flooding. The floods left $9million worth of damage to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal between Georgetown and Cumberland, Maryland, which was closed {{for the first time}} in its 157-year history. In general, the floods in Maryland caused less damage than in neighboring states, and overall damage in the state was estimated at $21million; there was one death.|$|E
500|$|The {{historic}} rainfall caused several dams to fill throughout northeast Mexico. In Nuevo León, due to {{the heavy}} rainfall, CNA also began water discharges of [...] from the La Boca Dam in Santiago, [...] from Cerro Prieto in Linares, and [...] from Cuchillo Dam in China; the dams were at 98%, 114%, and 124% of operating maximum capacity, respectively. Cuchillo Dam saw water inflows of [...] The water releases from these dams raised a state of alert in Tamaulipas, which was slated to receive the discharged water. In Coahuila, the rainfall caused La Fragua Dam to release [...] of water into the Rio Grande, and Amistad Dam to reach 119% of normal operating capacity. In {{the case of the}} latter dam, the excess storage in Amistad Lake sparked fears of flooding in downstream municipalities, although the possibility of <b>overtopping</b> of the dam was discarded by the Mexican section of the International Boundary and Water Commission. However, contingency plans were put in place to prepare for the crest of the Sabinas River, a tributary of the Rio Grande, and the subsequent crest on the Rio Grande itself, which was expected to carry at least [...] due to additional inflows from other tributaries. At one point, the Rio Grande was clocked at [...] due to its many flooded tributaries. [...] The river's rise forced the evacuation of 40 families in Piedras Negras, and required the closure of the Gateway to the Americas International Bridge and Colombia–Solidarity International Bridge between Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas and Laredo, Texas on July8.
