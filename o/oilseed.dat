Shortly after taking command of No.3 Squadron in May 1942, he was shot down and captured by Axis forces, and incarcerated in Italy.

Repatriated to England, he saw action during the invasion of Normandy in June 1944 before returning to Australia as chief instructor with No.2 Operational Training Unit. After the war he became a company director, and rejoined the RAAF as an active reserve officer from 1951 to 1953.

50|$|Before the Ethiopian Revolution, pulses and <b>oilseeds</b> {{played an}} {{important}} role, second only to coffee, in the country's exports. In EFY 1974/75, pulses and <b>oilseeds</b> accounted for 34% of export earnings (about 163 million Birr), but this share declined to about 3% (about 30 million Birr) in EFY 1988/89. Three factors contributed to {{the decline in the}} relative importance of pulses and <b>oilseeds.</b> First, the recurring droughts had devastated the country's main areas where pulses and <b>oilseeds</b> were grown. Second, because peasants faced food shortages, they gave priority to cereal staples to sustain themselves. Finally, although the production cost of pulses and <b>oilseeds</b> continued to rise, the government's price control policy left virtually unchanged the official procurement price of these crops, thus substantially reducing net income from them. In EFY 2007/2008, the CSA reported that 17,827,387.94 quintals of pulses were produced on 1,517,661.93 hectares, an increase from the 15,786,215.3 quintals produced on 1,379,045.77 hectares. In the same fiscal year, 707,059.29 hectares under cultivation produced 6,169,279.99 quintals of <b>oilseeds,</b> an increase from the previous year of 4,970,839.57 quintals grown on 741,790.98 hectares. In 2006/2007 (the latest year available), exports of <b>oilseeds</b> accounted for 15.78% of export earnings (or million 187.4 Birr) and pulses 5.92% (or 70.3 million Birr).|$|R
5|$|Birbhum is a {{major centre}} of cottage industries. Perhaps the most notable cottage {{industry}} is a non-profit rural organisation named Amar Kutir.

40|$|This {{scientific}} paper {{presents the}} evolution of <b>oilseeds</b> market in Romania, during the period 2008 - 2013. In order to show as concise as possible {{the reality of the}} <b>oilseeds</b> sector, the research pictures, on the one hand, an evolution of <b>oilseeds</b> specific indicators and on the other hand, an evolution of external trade. Romania disposes of tradition and favourable pedo-climatic conditions for cultivating the <b>oilseeds</b> plants. This is demonstrated by the favourable results obtained in the last years, especially concerning the sunflower crop. In 2013, Romania registered a record for sunflower, occupying the first position in the European Union for cultivated area and production. A negative aspect is represented by the fact that our country has the best conditions in Europe for soybean crop, but it is still dependent on import. Romania imports a huge quantity of soybean oilcakes for animal feeding. Nowadays, Romania is an important actor in the sunflower world market, covering almost 19 % of the global demand. In perspective, one could expect significant <b>oilseeds</b> productions with a positive influence on the agro-food trade balance in our country...|$|R
