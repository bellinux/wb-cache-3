Cain threw curveballs in roughly equal proportions to righties and lefties.|$|E

Drilling accounts for <b>over</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> costs, and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks.

Throughout the village, 71people were killed. <b>Over</b> <b>half</b> <b>the</b> town, including 20homes, were demolished due to the mudslide.

5|$|On 18 December 1939, Vickers Wellington bombers {{carried out}} a raid on German {{shipping}} in {{what became known as}} the Air Battle of the Heligoland Bight.

Ludlow-Hewitt presented a report on the attack on 22 December 1939, noting that flying straight and level for the CSBS made the bombers easy targets for fighters and anti-aircraft gunners.
