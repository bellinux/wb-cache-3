5000|$|On 1 April 2016, ADS {{confirmed}} {{that it was}} working to resolve manufacturing faults affecting fourteen propeller gear boxes (PGBs) produced by TP400 supplier Europrop International (EPI) {{in the first half}} of 2015. The gearboxes are made by Italian supplier Avio Aero, owned by General Electric. The issue involved a specific heat treatment process in manufacturing that adversely affected the strength of the ring gear; no other PGBs before or since were affected and the units involved either have been or are being changed. Airbus noted that [...] "pending full replacement of the batch, any aircraft can continue to fly with no more than one affected propeller gear box installed and is subject to continuing inspections." [...] Another PGB issue involves cracking of the input pinion plug, which in some cases can result in the release of small metallic particles into the oil system, where they are detected by a magnetic chip detector. Only engines 1 and 3, which have propellers that rotate to the right, are affected. The European Aviation Safety Agency has issued an Airworthiness Directive mandating immediate <b>on-wing</b> inspection, followed by replacement if evidence of damage is found, or else return-to-service and continuing inspections. On 27 April 2016, when delivering Q1 2016 financial results, Airbus warned there could be a significant cost in repairing the gearbox. In June 2016, two German A400Ms received in December 2014 - aircraft 54-01 and 54-02 - were temporarily grounded after inspections found heavy engine wear in the clockwise rotation PGBs after only 365 and 189 hours of operations, respectively. An interim fix for this PGB issue was certified in July 2016, which extends the inspection phase from 100 hours to 650 hours, with follow-up inspections every 150 hours, up from 20 hours.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Multiple {{classifier}} systems (MCS) {{are considered}} {{as one of the}} most significant advances in pattern classification in recent years. Numerous studies (both theoretical and empirical) have proved that MCS are effective in achieving improved classification performance for various application problems. Aircraft engine fault diagnosis plays a crucial rule in costeffective operation of aircraft engines. By accurately detecting and reliably diagnosing impending engine faults, aircraft engine fault diagnosis can help to increase engine <b>on-wing</b> time, reduce maintenance turnaround time, reduce aircraft life-cycle costs, and increase flight safety. However, designing a reliable aircraft engine fault diagnostic system is a challenging task, due to a number of characteristics of aircraft engines. These characteristics include the wide range of flight regime that aircraft engines are operated over and that engines experience normal wear that needs to be differentiated from faults. Motivated by a goal of achieving the highest possible performance of fault diagnosis, we introduce MCS to aircraft engine fault diagnosis.

40|$|In this study, coated {{reinforced}} carbon-carbon (RCC) samples of similar {{structure and composition}} as that from the NASA space shuttle orbiter s thermal protection system were fabricated with slots in their coating simulating craze cracks. These specimens were used to study oxidation damage detection and characterization using NDE methods. These specimens were heat treated in air at 1143 and 1200 C to create cavities in the carbon substrate underneath the coating as oxygen reacted with the carbon and resulted in its consumption. The cavities varied in diameter from approximately 1 to 3 mm.

40|$|It is {{generally}} known that an engine component will accumulate damage (life usage) during its lifetime of {{use in a}} harsh operating environment. The commonly used cycle count for engine component usage monitoring has an inherent range of uncertainty which can be overly costly or potentially less safe from an operational standpoint. With the advance of computer technology, engine operation modeling, and the understanding of damage accumulation physics, it is possible (and desirable) to use the available sensor information to make a more accurate assessment of engine component usage. This paper describes a probabilistic approach to quantify the effects of engine operating parameter uncertainties on the thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) life of a selected engine part. A closed-loop engine simulation with a TMF life model {{is used to calculate}} the life consumption of different mission cycles. A Monte Carlo simulation approach is used to generate the statistical life usage profile for different operating assumptions. The probabilities of failure of different operating conditions are compared to illustrate the importance of the engine component life calculation using sensor information.

40|$|Current {{aircraft}} engine controllers are designed and operated to provide both performance and stability margins. However, the standard {{method of operation}} results in significant {{wear and tear on}} the engine and negatively affects the <b>on-wing</b> life [...] the time between cycles when the engine must be physically removed from the aircraft for maintenance. The NASA Glenn Research Center and its industrial and academic partners have been working together toward a new control concept that will include engine life usage as part of the control function. The resulting controller will be able to significantly extend the engine's <b>on-wing</b> life with little or no impact on engine performance and operability. The new controller design will utilize damage models to estimate and mitigate the rate and overall accumulation of damage to critical engine parts. The control methods will also provide a means to assess tradeoffs between performance and structural durability on the basis of mission requirements and remaining engine life. Two life-extending control methodologies were studied to reduce the overall life-cycle cost of {{aircraft engine}}s. The first methodology is to modify the baseline control logic to reduce the thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) damage of cooled stators during acceleration. To accomplish this, an innovative algorithm limits the low-speed rotor acceleration command when the engine has reached a threshold close to the requested thrust. This algorithm allows a significant reduction in TMF damage with only a very small increase in the rise time to reach the commanded rotor speed. The second methodology is to reduce stress rupture/creep damage to turbine blades and uncooled stators by incorporating an engine damage model into the flight mission. Overall operation cost is reduced by an optimization among the flight time, fuel consumption, and component damages. Recent efforts have focused on applying life-extending control technology to an existing commercial turbine engine, and doing so without modifying the hardware or adding sensors. This approach makes it possible to retrofit existing engines with life-extending control technology by changing only the control software in the full-authority digital engine controller (FADEC). The significant results include demonstrating a 20 - to 30 -percent reduction in TMF damage to the hot section by developing and implementing smart acceleration logic during takeoff. The tradeoff is an increase, from 5. 0 to 5. 2 sec, in the time required to reach maximum power from ground idle. On a typical flight profile of a cruise at Mach 0. 8 at an altitude of 41, 000 ft, and cruise time of 104 min, the optimized system showed that a reduction in cruise speed from Mach 0. 8 to 0. 79 can achieve an estimated 25 -to 35 -percent creep/rupture damage reduction in the engine's hot section and a fuel savings of 2. 1 percent. The tradeoff is an increase in flight time of 1. 3 percent (1. 4 min) ...|$|E
40|$|The NASA Glenn Research Center and {{academic}} partners are developing advanced multiagent robotic control algorithms {{that will enable}} the autonomous inspection and repair of future propulsion systems. In this application, <b>on-wing</b> engine inspections will be performed autonomously by large groups of cooperative miniature robots that will traverse the surfaces of engine components to search for damage. The eventual goal is to replace manual engine inspections that require expensive and time-consuming full engine teardowns and allow the early detection of problems that would otherwise result in catastrophic component failures. As a preliminary step toward the long-term realization of a practical working system, researchers are developing the technology to implement a proof-of-concept testbed demonstration. In a multiagent system, the individual agents are generally programmed with relatively simple controllers that define a limited set of behaviors. However, these behaviors are designed {{in such a way}} that, through the localized interaction among individual agents and between the agents and the environment, they result in self-organized, emergent group behavior that can solve a given complex problem, such as cooperative inspection. One advantage to the multiagent approach is that it allows for robustness and fault tolerance through redundancy in task handling.

The experiment is being conducted {{under the auspices of}} NASA s Vehicle Integrated Propulsion Research (VIPR) Program and will take place in early 2014 at Edwards AFB in California as an on-ground, <b>on-wing</b> test. The primary objectives are to determine the effect on the engine of several hours of exposure to low to moderate ash concentrations, currently proposed at 1 and 10 mg/m 3 and to evaluate the capability of engine health management technologies for detecting these effects.

While not intended to be sufficient for rigorous certification of engine performance when ash is ingested, the experiment should provide useful information to aircraft manufacturers, airline operators, and military and civil regulators in their efforts to evaluate the range of risks that ash hazards pose to aviation...|$|E
40|$|Turbine engine life {{management}} {{is a very}} complicated process to ensure the safe operation of an engine subjected to complex usage. The challenge of life {{management is}} to find a reasonable compromise between the safe operation and the maximum usage of critical parts to reduce maintenance costs. The commonly used "cycle count" approach does not take the engine operation conditions into account, and it oversimplifies the calculation of the life usage. Because of the shortcomings, many engine components are regularly pulled for maintenance before their usable life is over. And, if an engine has been running regularly under more severe conditions, components might not be taken out of service before they exceed their designed risk of failure. The NASA Glenn Research Center and its industrial and academic partners have been using measurable parameters to improve engine life estimation. This study was based on the Monte Carlo simulation of 5000 typical flights under various operating conditions. First a closed-loop engine model was developed to simulate the engine operation across the mission profile and a thermomechanical fatigue (TMF) damage model was used to calculate the actual damage during takeoff, where the maximum TMF accumulates. Next, a Weibull distribution was used to estimate the implied probability of failure for a given accumulated cycle count. Monte Carlo simulations were then employed to find the profiles of the TMF damage under different operating assumptions including parameter uncertainties. Finally, probabilities of failure for different operating conditions were analyzed to demonstrate the importance of a sensor-based damage calculation in order to better manage the risk of failure and <b>on-wing</b> life...|$|E

Both airline and maintenance companies need the best possible accu-racy regarding the prediction of emerging costs and time of en-gine maintenance process to secure their operation. Estimating the deterioration status of engine modules prior to disassembling {{is one of the}} greatest challenges for the maintenance process. In a pilot project a Bayesian belief network (BBN) has been de-veloped to determine the deterioration condition of the General Electric CF 6 - 80 C 2 first stage high pressure turbine (HPT) noz-zle guide vane (NGV). The aim of this paper is to extend the used BBN techniques to the HPT first and second stage rotor blades and the second stage vanes. Thereby, its objective is to prove the successful application of the developed method for constructing a BBN for component hardware forecast. The BBN is composed of following parameters: component re-pair history, region, <b>on-wing</b> cycles, airfoil material, thrust rat-ing, engine wing position and customer segment. Performing statistical data analysis and combining these parameters with expert knowledge result in component specific BBNs. These nets provide a moderate forecast accuracy of 59 percent for the first stage rotor blades, 65 percent for the second stage rotor blades and promising 89 percent for the second stage NGVs. The paper concludes that a BBN has very good qualities to fore-cast the hardware condition of HPT components impressively shown by virtue of the nozzles.

40|$|Engine fleet {{management}} {{has always been}} one of the most challenging tasks in any airline as it requires assuring reliability and cost effectiveness of engine operation at all times. The engine maintenance expenses are quite significant and accounts for about one third of the total aircraft maintenance costs. For all airlines with “Labour & Material” type of contractual arrangement with respective OEM / MRO provider, maximizing engine’s Time <b>On-Wing</b> (TOW) is extremely crucial to face lower maintenance costs, while at the same time abiding by governing airworthiness standards. Engine’s TOW is generally limited due to at least one of the following reasons: performance degradation reflected by lower Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) margin, hot section hardware life monitored by regular borescope inspections and Life Limited parts (LLP) expiry enforced by OEM or regulatory authority. After introducing relevant aero engine maintenance concepts and terminology, this thesis will serve to provide both qualitative and quantitative assessment of how certain operational factors of flight profile influence engine performance deterioration and maintenance costs. One such factor is the thrust rating of the engine. Higher thrust gives rise to higher internal temperatures, exposing engine hardware to greater mechanical and thermal stresses and therefore leading to faster rate of degradation and earlier engine removal. This thesis will be of interest to airlines having at least two different types of aircraft models in their fleet with different average flight profiles but powered by the same engine model with the required thrust variant. A particular engine may spend some time first on the aircraft that requires higher thrust rating before being switched to the aircraft that requires lower thrust rating or vice versa. This thesis will look into the feasibility of such an operational strategy through different aspects and discuss its effectiveness in retaining the engine performance for a longer time, thereby affecting the operating fuel costs and restoration costs per flying hour expected at the time of shop visit...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{spending}} {{much of their}} operating life in clear air, aircraft gas turbine engines are naturally prone to deterioration as they are generally not fitted with air filters. Engines are particularly at risk during takeoff and landing, and whilst operating in areas of pollution, sand, dust storms, etc. The build-up of contaminants, especially on the compressor surfaces, leads to a dramatic reduction in compressor efficiency, which {{gives rise to a}} loss of available power, increased fuel consumption and increased exhaust gas temperature. These conditions can lead to flight delays, inspection failures, withdrawal from service, increased operating costs and safety compromises. With the growing interest in life cycle costs for gas turbine engines, both engine manufacturers and operators are investigating the tradeoffs between performance improvements and associated maintenance costs. This report introduces the problem of output and efficiency degradation in two aero gas turbine engines (the T 56 –A– 15 and the F 110 –GE– 129) caused by various deterioration factors. Their causes are broadly discussed and the effects on powerplant performance are simulated and analyzed. One of the key factors leading to performance losses during operation of these engines is compressor fouling. The fouling can come {{from a wide variety of}} sources; hydrocarbons from fuel and lubricating oils; volcanic ash; pollen; marine aerosols; dust; smoke; pollution, etc. The presence of these fouling sources acts as a bonding agent for the solid contaminants, ‘gluing’ them to the compressor surfaces. Thus, the aggravation in terms of power output, fuel consumption and additional time to carry out a typical mission will be assessed and an economic analysis will be attempted in order to quantify the effects of compressor fouling on the additional costs which arise, because of this specific deterioration. The effect of compressor fouling can be maintained by frequent cleaning to improve efficiency, resulting, hence, in improved power output, fuel savings and prolonged engine life. Compressor cleaning is thoroughly presented, and the implementation of <b>on-wing</b> off-line cleaning on the performance of the F 110 engine was investigated from a technical and economical standpoint. Finally, according to the results obtained, the optimal frequency of compressor washing for the F 110 engine is estimated, in order to eliminate safety compromises, improve performance and reduce the engine’s life cycle cost...|$|E
40|$|The {{instrumentation}} and {{the developments}} {{presented in this}} thesis aim to address the challenges associated with in-service non-destructive testing of aeroengine components, imposed by severe restrictions on component accessibility. In-service non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential to ensure early detection of service-induced damage and prevent catastrophic failures of such safety-critical aeroengine components as turbine/compressor blades and disks, increasing the safety of operations and dramatically reducing the cost of engine changes. The main concern during their inspection is detection of fatigue cracking, typically initiated {{on the surface of}} the part. The application of inspection techniques used during overhaul to <b>on-wing</b> testing is restricted both by the complex, spatially-confined access to the components and the inaccessibility of the high-stress concentration surfaces in the full engine assembly. Two routinely-used techniques providing a solution to these challenges are the use of endoscopes for access and surface acoustic waves to inspect parts of the assembly. CHOTs are optically-activated ultrasonic transducers located on the surface of a sample, that use laser illumination to remotely generate and detect ultrasound, providing a non-contact wireless alternative to conventional piezoelectric transducers (PZTs). The benefits of optical activation are paired with fibre-optic light delivery in an endoscopic pulser [...] a simple portable ultrasonic inspection system with flexible instrumentation, beneficial for testing hard-to-reach components in locations with limited access or hazardous environments. This thesis presents the instrumentation of the endoscopic pulser and the development of the self-adhesive portable CHOTs (SA CHOTs) to complement its potential field application by enabling transducer delivery to components in-service and application to large and curved parts, previously limited by laboratory-based direct on-sample CHOT fabrication. The developed transducers overcome frequent barriers for industrial adaptation of fully-optical inspection systems presented by the sample surface conditions such as reflectivity and roughness. The NDT capabilities of the CHOTs endoscopic pulser are demonstrated by performing detection of machined slots on controlled aluminium samples and representative industrial parts using 4 [...] 5 MHz surface acoustic waves. System capabilities for active structural health monitoring (SHM) as well as inspection of samples in motion are demonstrated. Although in its present configuration the size of the endoscope exceeds practical access requirements, the potential of the system for further development and miniaturisation is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Lógica matemática. Engine health {{monitoring}} data {{is at the}} current core of the civil aeronautical business. The use of engine {{health monitoring}} systems has existed for several years, however it is only now that the in-flight knowledge gathered through this means {{is being used to}} address not only safety and reliability but to also understand customer operation and the overall engine condition. The assessment of EHM data for optimized life cycle cost, this is, the extension of an engine¿s time on wing and reduction of maintenance costs, has not yet been fully exploited due to several reasons. The main reasons however have been the lack of available data and the time and material type of maintenance operation common until now. Modern technology and a change towards TotalCare have influenced the current importance of EHM and its detailed assessment developments. This thesis develops a new EHM assessment methodology and its associated prognosis with the main objective of improving the level of engine maintenance required detail for a given engine prior to its maintenance shop visit. In addition, the prognosis methodology provides a significant long term capability {{on the state of the}} engine at module level which enables trade studies, not possible today. The existing EHM assessment capabilities concentrate on the safety and reliability aspects of engine containment and its reactive capabilities. The EHM methods developed are a proactive approach towards interpreting EHM data in its full extent, without filtering, in order to determine the actual condition of an engine at a modular level. The application of existing methods as BSS, and subsequently a possibilistic filter together with a fuzzy classifier, have enabled a new approach at understanding the internal engine condition through the combined assessment of all of the available variables. A subsequent classification method which enables the association of this level of deterioration to a known state or level of deterioration allows for a prediction of the level of engine deterioration, expected cost of maintenance and main exchanged parts to be replaced, to be performed. The assessment of events or condition changes does not directly reflect the deterioration of the engine. A sequence mining approach to the previous results obtained above was carried out to establish if certain sequences may be associated to specific levels of deterioration, transitions or to no significant changes. The additional knowledge provided through these methodologies to the current business is already a significant step change. A prognosis however was developed associated to this engine condition assessment which further enables the detailed understanding of the engine remaining useful life based on the integral of the instantaneous engine deterioration speed and the life objective established on its release. The result from this assessment is a new set of methods, which allows the maintenance facilities to optimize their limited capacity and predict in detail the level of workscope and man-hours to be employed for specific engine refurbishments. These methods also allow trade studies to be performed to optimize time <b>on-wing</b> versus over all engine level of deterioration...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{modelling}} and simulation {{have played}} a critical role in the research and development towards today’s powerful and efficient gas turbine engines for both aviation and power generation. The simultaneous progress in modelling methods, numerical methods, software development tools and methods, and computer platform technology has provided the gas turbine community with ever more accurate design, performance prediction and analysis tools. An important element is the development towards generic tools, in order to avoid duplication of model elements for different engine types. This thesis focuses on the development of generic gas turbine system performance simulation methods. This includes the research required to find the optimal mathematical representation of the aero-thermodynamic processes in the gas turbine components in terms of fidelity, accuracy and computing power limitations. The results have been applied in the development of the Gas turbine Simulation Program GSP. GSP is a modelling tool for simulation and analysis of gas turbine system performance. This involves 0 -D (i. e. zero-dimensional or parametric) component sub-models that calculate averaged values for parameters such as pressures and temperatures at the gas path stations between the components. The component sub-models are configured (‘stacked’) corresponding to the gas turbine configuration. Component performance is determined by both aero-thermodynamic equations and user specified characteristics, such as turbomachinery performance maps. If higher fidelity is required at a specific location in the system model, 1 -D component models can be added to predict the change in gas state or other parameters as a function of a spatial (usually in the direction of a streamline) parameter. Non-linear differential equations (NDEs) are used to represent the conservation laws and other relations among the components. The sets of NDEs are automatically configured depending on the specific gas turbine configuration and type of simulation. Simulation types include design point (DP), steady-state off-design (OD) and transient simulations. The research and development challenge lies in the development of generic, accurate and user friendly system modelling methods with sufficient flexibility to represent any type of gas turbine configuration. The accuracy and fidelity is enhanced by the development of modelling methods capturing secondary effects on component and system performance in 0 -D or 1 -D sub-models. Object oriented software design methods have been used to accomplish the flexibility objectives, also resulting in a high degree of code maintainability. This allows easy adaptation and extension of functionalities to meet new requirements that are emerging since the start of the development of GSP in its current form (1997). The object oriented architecture and how it relates to the system and component modelling and the ensuing solving of the NDEs, is described in the thesis. An important element has been the development of the gas model with chemical equilibrium and gas composition calculations throughout the cycle. Fuel composition can be specified in detail for accurate prediction of effects of alternative fuels and also detailed emission prediction methods are added. The gas model uses a unique and efficient method to iterate towards chemical equilibrium. The object oriented architecture enabled the embedding of a generic adaptive modelling (AM) functionality in the GSP numerical process and NDEs, providing best AM calculation speed and stability. With AM, model characteristics are adapted for matching specified (often measured) output parameter values for engine test analysis, diagnostics and condition monitoring purposes. The AM functionality can be directly applied to any GSP engine model. The recent trend towards the development of micro turbines (with very high surface-to-volume ratios in the gas path) requires accurate representation of thermal (heat transfer) effects on performance. For this purpose, GSP has been extended with an object oriented thermal network modelling capability. Also, a 1 -D thermal model for representing the significant heat soakage effects on micro turbine recuperator transient performance has been developed. For real-time transient simulation, the Turbine Engine Real-Time Simulator (TERTS) modelling tool has been derived from GSP. In TERTS, the methods from GSP are used with fidelity reduced to some extent in order to meet the real-time execution requirements. GSP has been applied to a wide variety of gas turbine performance analysis problems. The adaptive modelling (AM) based gas path analysis functionality has been applied in several gas turbine maintenance environments. Isolation of deteriorated and faulty turbofan engine components was successfully demonstrated using both test rig data and <b>on-wing</b> data measured on-line during flight. For a conceptual design of a 3 kW recuperated micro turbine for CHP applications, design point cycle parameters were optimized based on careful component efficiency and loss estimates. Worst and best case scenarios were analysed with GSP determining sensitivity to deviations from the estimates. The predictions have proven very accurate after a test program showing 12 % (electric power) efficiency on the first prototype. For increasing the efficiency towards 20 %, GSP was used to predict the impact of several design improvements on system efficiency. GSP was used to study the effects on performance and losses of scaling micro turbines in the range of 3 to 36 kW. At small scales, turbomachinery losses become relatively large due to the smaller Reynolds number (larger viscous losses) and other effects. The scale effects have been analysed and modelled for the turbine and compressor and GSP has been used to predict the effects on system efficiency. Other applications include prediction of cumulative exhaust gas emissions of the different phases of commercial aircraft flights, simulation of thermal load profiles for hot section lifing studies, alternative fuel effect studies, performance prediction of vertical take-off propulsion systems and reverse engineering studies. The object oriented design of GSP has proven its value and has provided the building blocks for an ever increasing number of component models, adaptations and extensions. The flexibility of GSP is demonstrated with the modelling of novel cycles, including a parallel twin spool micro turbine with a single shared combustor, a rotating combustor micro turbine concept, a modern heavy duty gas turbine with a second (reheat) combustor and a multi-fuel hybrid turbofan engine, also with a reheat combustor. Several new capabilities have been developed following new requirements from the user community, using the original object oriented framework and component model classes. In the future, new technologies may replace today’s simulation tools. Maybe even the concept of modelling and simulation as we know it today will entirely change. However, as long as gas turbines and related systems will be developed and operated, there will be a need to understand their behaviour. The fundamental physics behind this will not change nor will the equations describing the processes. In that sense, GSP can be seen as a phase in the development of gas turbine modelling and simulation technology. An interesting question would be, how long will GSP remain before it is left behind for new ways. A lot will depend on the ability of GSP and its developers to adapt to future needs and also future opportunities emerging from new modelling, simulation, and computer and software technologies. So far however, GSP has proven a remarkable track record and will be around for quite a while, serving many scientists and engineers interested in gas turbine system performance analysis and simulation.
