5|$|After the British army {{captured}} Palestine {{from the}} Ottomans in 1917-1918, Bayt Jibrin resumed {{its role as}} an important town in the District of Hebron. The population was entirely Muslim, and had two schools, a medical clinic, a bus and a police station. The town's inhabitants cultivated grain and fruit, and residents from nearby towns flocked to its weekly market or souk. During the winter of 1920-1921 there was a severe <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria.</b> 157 villagers (one-sixth of the population) died with the mortality rate in the district reaching 68 per 1,000. Crops remained unharvested {{due to lack of}} people strong enough to work in the fields. The new British regime began a program of sealing open wells, improving drainage and distributing quinine across Palestine. In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bayt Jibrin had a population of 1,420, all Muslim, increasing the 1931 census to 1,804, still all Muslim, in a total of 369 houses.|$|E
5|$|The {{deportation}} {{policy was}} tightened during the 1730s, after an <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> killed thousands, including the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Dirck van Cloon. According to Indonesian historian Benny G. Setiono, the outbreak {{was followed by}} increased suspicion and resentment in native Indonesians and the Dutch toward the ethnic Chinese, who were growing in number and whose wealth was increasingly visible. As a result, Commissioner of Native Affairs Roy Ferdinand, under orders of Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier, decreed on 25July 1740 that Chinese considered suspicious would be deported to Ceylon (modern day Sri Lanka) and forced to harvest cinnamon. Wealthy Chinese were extorted by corrupt Dutch officials who threatened them with deportation; Stamford Raffles, a British explorer and historian of Java, noted in 1830 that in some Javanese accounts, the Dutch were told by the Dutch-appointed Chinese headman of Batavia, Nie Hoe Kong, Kapitein der Chinezen, to deport all Chinese wearing black or blue because these {{were thought to be}} poor. There were also rumours that deportees were not taken to their destinations but were thrown overboard once out of sight of Java, and in some accounts, they died when rioting on the ships. The deportation of ethnic Chinese caused unrest among the remaining Chinese, leading many Chinese workers to desert their jobs.|$|E

25|$|This time, {{to prevent}} {{providing}} Sukarno with a {{platform to make}} political speeches, the hardline governor-general Jonkheer Bonifacius Cornelis de Jonge utilised his emergency powers to send Sukarno to internal exile without trial. In 1934, Sukarno was shipped, along with his family (including Inggit Garnasih), to the remote town of Ende, {{on the island of}} Flores. During his time in Flores, he utilised his limited freedom of movement to establish a children's theatre. Among its members was future politician Frans Seda. Due to an <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> in Flores, the Dutch authorities decided to move Sukarno and his family to Bencoolen (now Bengkulu) on western coast of Sumatra, in February 1938.|$|E

Loring was ordered to sail her back to Britain in June, escorting a large convoy, and arrived in the Downs on 11 August. He briefly paid her off and she was taken into Portsmouth Dockyard for a refit, before rejoining the Channel Fleet, still off Brest, and under the command of Admiral Sir William Cornwallis. These duties lasted until early 1805, with Loring being superseded by Captain John Cooke on 24 April.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} {{with many of}} his scholar-gentry colleagues who lacked a military training, Định was regarded as having {{a good understanding of}} the capabilities and limitations of his armed resistance. Định hoped to wear down the French over an extended period by exploiting the constant <b>outbreak</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> among the Europeans. During the initial phase of the invasion in 1858, the French had suffered heavily from tropical disease. Định calculated that such illnesses would partly compensate for the inferior weaponry of his forces. He attempted to maintain an administration parallel to the one imposed on the districts by the French admirals. These objectives required a high degree of regional coordination, something that was impossible without the support of the imperial bureaucracy. Định's appeal among the peasantry was attributed to their gratitude for his administration of the đồn điền. Under such a system, he was responsible for assisting them in matters such as clearing land, educating the community, providing health care and mediating disputes. Joining the resistance army was seen as a means of showing trust and gratitude. Hịch Trương Định (The proclamation of Trương Định), which was believed to have been written in 1862 or 1863, emphasised such themes. It read: ...|$|E

During 1754-1756 they were administrated from Tranquebar (in continental Danish India). The islands were repeatedly abandoned due to <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria</b> between 14 April 1759 and 19 August 1768, from 1787 to 1807/05, 1814 to 1831, 1830 to 1834 and gradually from 1848 for good.|$|R

While northern Australia previously experienced regular <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria,</b> the disease was eliminated in 1962 [1] – although it still experiences sporadic <b>outbreaks</b> following reintroductions <b>of</b> the parasites [2].

5|$|Due to the {{hurricane}} and the widespread destruction, {{the hurricane}} caused <b>outbreaks</b> <b>of</b> <b>malaria,</b> dengue, cholera, and various fever and respiratory illnesses.

Damaged crops also prevented the export of cash crops, and exports decreased by 9.4% in 1999. Many of the people left homeless also became unemployed, and there were reductions in exports and economic growth. Officials set up shelters that housed 285,000people for about a month. In Tegucigalpa, where the Choluteca River was dammed by a landslide, a temporary lagoon filled with sewage persisted for about two months, until a crew from the United States Army Corps of Engineers and United States Geological Survey dug a channel to drain the water.|$|R
40|$|Epidemiological Surveillance allows {{tracking}} down sources of diseases {{and the movement}} of contagions.
