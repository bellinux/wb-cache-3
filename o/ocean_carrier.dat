40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} a novel multi-level hierarchical approach which models the oligopolistic and competitive behavior of carriers and their relationships in maritime freight transportation networks. With {{the merger of}} the carriers’ industry and some dominant carriers in a shipping market, the carrier competition frequently exhibits an oligopolistic nature. Three types of carriers are considered herein; <b>ocean</b> <b>carriers,</b> land carriers and port terminal operators. The oligopolistic <b>ocean</b> <b>carriers,</b> land carriers and port terminal operators {{compete with each other}} in their pricing and routing decisions, respectively. The carriers determine service charges and delivery routes at different parts of the multimodal freight network, having hierarchical interactions. In a game theoretic approach, <b>ocean</b> <b>carriers</b> are regarded as the leaders in an oligopoly shipping market. Port terminal operators are the followers of <b>ocean</b> <b>carriers</b> as well as the leaders of land carriers. For the individual carrier problems, Nash equilibrium is used to find the optimal decisions for which each carrier obtains the greatest profit. A three–level model is formulated to capture the interactions among different types of carriers. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the validity and capability of the model...|$|R

An international standards group similar to the Paris based International Chamber of Commerce could devise the service standards that partners should accept and work to. Then both <b>ocean</b> <b>carriers</b> and customers as well as partners could measure departure from these service standards, and could share information to track them and identify how to improve.|$|R

50|$|Not all LTL {{shipments}} {{travel by}} truck only. LTL carriers rely on rail or air to forward some freight toward its destination. LTL carriers are normally {{able to deal}} with railroads more effectively than small shippers since LTL carriers typically send a large volume of freight daily. For example, a significant portion of rail intermodal traffic consists of UPS truck trailers, often dozens in a single intermodal train, carrying LTL freight. LTL carriers are able to monitor railroad performance to ensure delivery of freight within the specified delivery window. An Intermodal freight transport shipment employs several methods of transporting goods from start to finish. For instance one shipment will start out on the railroad, then be transferred to an <b>ocean</b> <b>carrier,</b> and end up on a truck before delivery.|$|E

For these ten containers, ICC Ltd. arranged for carriage by truck from Milperra to Sydney, by sea from Sydney to Savannah, by rail from Savannah to Huntsville, Alabama, and by truck from Huntsville to Athens.

5000|$|Claims {{for damage}} to cargo shipped by <b>ocean</b> <b>carrier</b> in {{international}} commerce {{into and out}} of the United States are governed by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (COGSA), which is the U.S. enactment of the Hague Rules. One of its key features is that a carrier is liable for cargo damaged from [...] "hook to hook," [...] meaning from loading to discharge, unless it is exonerated under one of 17 exceptions to liability, such as an [...] "act of God," [...] the inherent nature of the goods, errors in navigation, and management of the ship. A shipowner is generally entitled to limit its liability to $500 per package, unless the value of the contents is disclosed and marked on the container. There is significant litigation as to what constitutes a [...] "package" [...] for purposes of determining liability under COGSA. This practice has resulted in substantial and continuing litigation in the United States. Federal Courts in the United States, however, are reluctant to treat an ocean shipping container as a single COGSA package. The statute of limitations on cargo claims is one year.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the pricing scheme of <b>ocean</b> <b>carrier</b> for inbound container storage so as to assist container supply chain finance. In this paper, how an <b>ocean</b> <b>carrier</b> should set price of inbound container storage to the customer while facing the contract from the container terminal operator is first analyzed. Then, two different contract systems, the free-time contract system which is widely used in practice and the free-space contract system which is newly developed recently, are considered. In the two different contract systems, inbound container storage pricing models are constructed, and accordingly optimal solution approaches for the <b>ocean</b> <b>carrier</b> are provided. For comparison purpose, some numerical experiments for the two different contract systems are conducted to investigate the effects of the container terminal operator’s decision on the system outcomes. Numerical experiments show that (1) the carrier is more flexible in the free-space contract system and can receive more profit by using the free-storage-space as a pooling storage system and (2) the free-space contract system benefits both the carrier in profit and the busy terminal in traffic control...|$|E
40|$|Maritime freight {{shipping}} {{has increased}} significantly {{and air pollution}} from international ships has grown accordingly, having serious environmental effects all over the world. This paper analyzes {{the effects of the}} emission cost on ocean route choices, focusing on international container ships. First, the paper formulates a freight network model that captures decisions and interactions of <b>ocean</b> <b>carriers</b> and port terminal operators in the maritime freight transport system. Then, the emission cost is calculated based on an activity-based approach as a component of the ocean transportation cost function. A case study is examined to find if the emission cost affects ocean route choices. The results indicate that the optimal ocean route and transportation cost are changed distinctively due to the emission cost. The research discusses how the emission cost plays a role in route changes and why <b>ocean</b> <b>carriers</b> have to consider these costs in their routing decisions...|$|R

40|$|Firms buy factor inputs in {{the factor}} market and sell {{value-added}} outputs to {{customers in the}} product market. Firms also engage in economic exchanges along and across the value chain. The combination of these value-adding and exchange functions determine a firm’s performance. This paper examines how the factor and product markets are related to organisational capacity and firm performance in the container shipping industry. The findings revealed that the price on the product market is positively related to the production capacity of the industry. This study also illustrates the relationship between firm size and level of vertical expansion for carriers to own ships rather than charter ships from the factor market. A regression equation model is developed to predict the level of ordering new ships by <b>ocean</b> <b>carriers.</b> This study tests the relationship between organisational capacity and firm performance, shedding light on the profitability of <b>ocean</b> <b>carriers.</b> Department of Logistics and Maritime StudiesAuthor name used in this publication: Y.
