5000|$|Maltz has researched, lectured, {{and written}} about women's sexual fantasies and sexual arousal. She co-authored Private Thoughts: Exploring the Power <b>of</b> Women’s Sexual <b>Fantasies</b> (with Suzie Boss and first {{published}} as In the Garden of Desire). This seminal work includes the categorizing <b>of</b> women's sexual <b>fantasies</b> into [...] "scripted" [...] and [...] "unscripted" [...] and additional breaking down <b>of</b> <b>fantasies</b> into more specific subcategories (i.e. [...] "Pretty Maiden" [...] "Victim" [...] "Wild Woman" [...] "Dominatrix""Beloved" [...] and [...] "Voyeur"). She has described various positive functions <b>of</b> sexual <b>fantasy,</b> {{as well as}} the types of problems that can emerge when the contents and employment <b>of</b> sexual <b>fantasies</b> strongly conflicts with a person’s goals and values.|$|R
50|$|The {{incidence}} <b>of</b> sexual <b>fantasies</b> {{is nearly}} universal, but vary by gender, age, sexual orientation, and society. However, {{because of a}} reliance on retrospective recall, as well as response bias and taboo, there is an inherent difficulty in measuring the frequency <b>of</b> types <b>of</b> <b>fantasies.</b> In general, the most common fantasies {{for men and women}} are: reliving an exciting sexual experience, imagining sex with a current partner, and imagining sex with a different partner. There is no consistent difference in the popularity of these three categories <b>of</b> <b>fantasies.</b> The next most common fantasies involve oral sex, sex in a romantic location, sexual power or irresistibility, and rape.|$|R

5|$|World Fantasy Award nominees and {{winners are}} decided by judges and {{attendees}} of the World Fantasy Convention. A ballot is posted in June for attendees {{of the current}} and previous two conferences to determine two of the finalists, with the two most-nominated selected, and a panel of five judges adds three or more nominees before voting on the overall winner. The panel of judges is typically made up <b>of</b> <b>fantasy</b> authors, {{as well as other}} fantasy professionals and is chosen each year by the World Fantasy Awards Administration, which has the power to break ties if the judges are deadlocked. The awards administration is a subgroup of the World Fantasy Convention Board, which selects sites for upcoming World Fantasy Conventions. Both the board and the judges panel are largely made up of professionals in the field <b>of</b> <b>fantasy.</b> The judges for the 2014 awards, for example, were authors Andy Duncan, Kij Johnson, Oliver Johnson, and Liz Williams, and editor John Klima.|$|E
