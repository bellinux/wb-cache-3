5|$|The Antarctic scallop {{was first}} {{described}} by the British zoologist Edgar Albert Smith in 1902 as Pecten colbecki. He worked at the British Museum and was responsible for examining and describing shells from collections made <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> had been deposited there. The German malacologist Johannes Thiele determined in 1934 that {{the characteristics of the}} Antarctic scallop were sufficiently different from those of other members of the genus Pecten to warrant its inclusion in a separate genus, Adamussium. More recently, examinations of the chromosome structure and of the mitochondrial DNA of A. colbecki have been undertaken, but the exact phylogenetic relationship it has with other pectinids is still unclear.|$|E
5|$|The World Fantasy Awards are a set {{of awards}} given each year for the best fantasy fiction {{published}} during the previous calendar year. Organized and overseen by the World Fantasy Convention, the awards are given each year at the eponymous annual convention as the central focus of the event. They were first given in 1975, at the first World Fantasy Convention, and have been awarded annually since. <b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> the award has been given, the categories presented have changed; currently World Fantasy Awards are given in five written categories, one category for artists, and four special categories for individuals to honor their general {{work in the field}} of fantasy.|$|E

5|$|In {{the final}} Test at The Oval, Bradman {{walked out to}} bat in Australia's first innings. He {{received}} a standing ovation from the crowd and three cheers from the opposition. His Test batting average stood at 101.39. Facing the wrist-spin of Eric Hollies, Bradman pushed forward to the second ball that he faced, was deceived by a googly, and bowled between bat and pad for a duck. An England batting collapse resulted in an innings defeat, denying Bradman the opportunity to bat again and so his career average finished at 99.94; if he had scored just four runs in his last innings, {{it would have been}} 100. A story developed <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> claimed Bradman missed the ball because of tears in his eyes, a claim Bradman denied {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|<b>Over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> the Atlantic {{hurricane}} basin {{has been}} thoroughly studied since 1851, {{there was only}} one other storm prior to Hurricane Fred to attain Category 3 intensity south of 30°N and east of 35°W. This storm was Hurricane Frances in 1980. Frances attained major hurricane status farther south and east than Fred; however, Fred was the strongest of the two, peaking with estimated winds of 120mph (195km/h) and a minimum pressure of 958mbar (hPa; 28.29inHg). Just over a year later, this intensity record was broken by Hurricane Julia, which attained winds of 140mph (220km/h) and a pressure of 948mbar (hPa; 27.99inHg) at 17.7°N and 32.2°W, becoming the easternmost-forming Category4 hurricane on record. In one of the NHC's discussions on Hurricane Fred, it was mentioned that due to the unusual location of a storm of its intensity, the hurricane would likely have gone unnoticed before the advent of satellite imagery in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|The Hugo Awards are {{a set of}} {{literary}} awards given annually for the best science fiction or fantasy works and achievements of the previous year.

Organized and overseen by the World Science Fiction Society, the awards are given each year at the annual World Science Fiction Convention as the central focus of the event.

Throughout 1998–2002 it would train with German engineers, including German units from Lahnstein and Speyer, {{as well as the}} German Engineering School. The brigade also set up marksman competitions with German units, to give US soldiers the chance to earn the German Armed Forces Badge of Marksmanship, the German Sports Badge, and other badges. Over 2,500 of these badges would be earned by soldiers of the 130th <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> it served in Germany. It also trained extensively in bridging operations at rivers throughout Germany. In summer of 2000, the brigade participated in a joint engineering exercise in Moldova with US Navy Seabees and the 505th Engineer Brigade of the North Carolina Army National Guard. The exercise was the first ever conducted in Moldova and featured numerous training scenarios as well as the construction of a medical clinic. Several other such exercises were conducted in nations throughout Europe including Albania, Romania, Georgia, Latvia, Bulgaria and Macedonia. They also performed annual humanitarian missions to Poland, working on community projects around the country with the assistance of Polish Armed Forces every September, as a training exercise.|$|E

She held various titles <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> indicated her advancing rank as a favored consort until she eventually became Empress Dowager in 1933.
