5|$|The lipid {{component}} of MFGM {{is rich in}} phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, and cholesterol. Phospholipids make up approximately 30% of the total lipid weight of MFGM, the three most prominent being sphingomyelin (SM), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which together represent up to 85% of total phospholipids. Phospholipids and sphingolipids play central roles in cerebral neurogenesis and migration during fetal development, as well as promoting neuronal growth, differentiation, and synaptogenesis {{during the first year}} of life. Other important polar lipids present in the membrane include the glycerophospholipids phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylinositol (PI), as well as gangliosides (GG), which are sphingolipids containing sialic acid and an <b>oligosaccharide</b> side chain.

The degraded smaller oligosaccharides; (M-r < 1000) were baseline-separated by CE under a 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 9. 0) in 10 min. Standard heparin disaccharides and larger <b>oligosaccharides</b> (1000 < M-r < 8000) were all separated under optimized separation conditions. Compared with standard heparin disaccharides, smaller <b>oligosaccharides</b> contained one nonsulfated, two monosulfated, and two disulfated disaccharides, but trisulfated disaccharides were not found. The smaller <b>oligosaccharides</b> were also identified and molecular mass was deduced by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). Furthermore, interactions between G-CSF and the oligosaccharides; were studied by using capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) under the above separation conditions. It was found that larger <b>oligosaccharides</b> could interact with G-CSF while smaller <b>oligosaccharides</b> were not observed to bind to G-CSF under the experimental conditions.
