Things didn't get much better once the season began when the team received a 17-3 defeat away at Oxford (although this was an improvement on the 23-5 loss that took place the year before). The next game saw things go {{from bad to worse}} when London Dragons made their visit to the Welsh capital in a game that saw 3 Redhawks ejected in what had been a promising first period where they were trailing by just one goal almost up until the buzzer.

Despite this Cardiff picked up 4 points on the year and reduced their goals against average by nearly 3 goals a game <b>on</b> <b>last</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

Nadal missed the last Masters of the event in the BNP Paribas Masters due to a shoulder injury. This is his fourth appearance reaching the Semifinals twice having a 4-7 record.
