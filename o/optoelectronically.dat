Thus, supramolecular chemist wants to improve their photovoltaic performance by constructing an ordered, oriented and high hierarchical architecture on solid surface. Matile and co-workers introduced a high hierarchical network, called zipper assembly. Dream zipper assembly will be “panchromatic zipper assembly” which can absorb solar illumination AM 1. 5.

Functionalisation of these materials {{is considered to be a}} key step in tailoring their properties towards specific applications and unlocking their full potential. Here we present a van der Waals functionalisation strategy for creating MoS 2 nanosheets decorated with free base phthalocyanine chromophores. The semiconducting sheets are found to intimately interact with these <b>optoelectronically</b> active chromophores, resulting in an electronic heterostructure that exhibits enhanced optoelectronic properties and exploitable charge transfer. We show that by utilising laterally confined MoS 2 nanosheets, the conduction band of the semiconductor could be positioned between the chromophore&# 039;s S 1 and S 2 states. Consequently, bidirectional photoinduced electron transfer processes are observed, with excitation of the functionalised nanosheet&# 039;s semiconductor transition resulting in electron transfer to the phthalocyanine&# 039;s LUMO, and excitation of the chromophore&# 039;s S 2 state leading to electron injection into the MoS 2 conduction band.

The goal {{of this study is to}} evaluate the biomechanical advantage of a dual rod construct in the thoracolumbar spine, using a burst fracture cadaveric model. Methods: Seven fresh human cadaveric (T 9 -L 3) spines were tested in normal conditions, after an iatrogenic T 12 burst fracture, and successively after laminectomy and standard two rod pedicle screw stabilization (two level above and two below) and two different dual rod overlapping constructs.

While {{the dynamics of the}} two systems are very different, robust synchronization of end lasers is obtained in both cases over a range of parameters. Here, we present analysis and numerical simulation to explain some of the observed synchronization phenomena. First, we introduce the system of three coupled semiconductor lasers and discuss the onset of oscillations that occurs via a bifurcation as the coupling strength increases. Next, we analyze the synchronization of the end lasers by examining the dynamics transverse to synchronized state. We prove that chaotic synchronization of the outer semiconductor lasers will occur for sufficiently long delays, and we make a comparison to generalized synchronization in driven dissipative systems. It is shown that the stability of synchronous state (as indicated by negative Lyupunov exponents transverse to the synchronization manifold) depends on the internal dissipation of the outer lasers.

40|$|Biosensors for DNA (genosensors) are of {{significant}} interest because they address {{the need for}} rapid diagnosis of, e. g., genetic disorders and infections by pathogens. Electrochemical genosensors are of particular interest because they are miniaturised more readily than optical sensors, typically require small sample volumes, little sample pre-treatment, and are suitable for use with portable instrumentation by minimally trained clinical personnel. We here present the combination of two strategies towards sequence-selective DNA detection, viz. intrinsically sequence-selective electrochemical detection of DNA hybridisation and detection of double-stranded DNA by electronically active molecules. A capture strand, either DNA or PNA (peptide nucleic acid) is immobilised on an electrode, using immobilisation procedures which have previously been optimised for DNA detection using electrochemically impedance spectroscopy. Following hybridisation, an electronically active molecule binds to the duplex DNA on the electrode, establishing a detectable electronic contact, thus acting as “sensitisers” for the electrochemical detection. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried out using two types of sensitisers: a Co aqphen complex binding to dsDNA through intercalation and a cationic quaterthiophene binding through the minor groove. The intercalation of a cobalt(II) complex containing mixed-ligands of 12, 17 -dihydronaphtho- 2, 3 -hdipyrido- 3, 2 -a: 2 ', 3 '-c-phenazine- 12, 17 -dione (aqphen) and glycolic acid (GA), [Co(GA) 2 (aqphen) ] with DNA was investigated by electronic absorption spectroscopy. The corresponding phen complex, with an oxidation potential of 0. 12 V vs Ag/AgCl, had previously shown weak intercalation. Increasing the conjugation with an anthraquinone increased significantly the binding affinity of the complex. The use of an <b>optoelectronically</b> active cationic quaterthiophene as a sensitiser was also explored. This water-soluble quaterthiophene interacts with dsDNA with an affinity of 10 ^ 5 M- 1 and has an oxidation potential of 1. 0 V vs Ag/AgCl.

40|$|The secure {{identification}} {{of an object}} or electronic system is carried out through the provision of some unique internal or external characteristic. The most obvious examples of these include passwords and fingerprints that can identify a person or an electronic device, and holograms that can tag any given object to provide a check of its authenticity. Unfortunately, modern technology provides resources that enable the trust of these everyday techniques to be undermined. Identification schemes have been proposed {{to address these issues}} by extracting the identity of a system from its underlying physical structure, which is constructed such that the system is hard‐to‐ clone or predict. These systems are known as Unique Objects (UNOs) and Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). The aim of the work in this thesis is to create a novel type of UNO/PUF that utilises the atomic‐scale uniqueness of semiconductor devices by measuring a macroscopic quantum property of the system. The variations in these quantum properties are amplified by the existence of such atomic‐scale imperfections, meaning these devices would be the hardest possible system to clone, use the least resources and provide robust security. Such devices would be of great societal and political significance and would provide the biggest technological barrier between the good guys and the bad.

40|$|Organic {{semiconductors}} {{have emerged}} as potential replacements for inorganic materials based on several promising advantages, such as their low-cost, high-throughput fabrication and tolerance for flexible substrates. While these attributes ensure {{that the use of}} organic semiconductors is appealing, further improvements in electronic performance and stability are still required. This work focuses on the design, synthesis and analysis of a novel range of organic semiconductors incorporating carborane units. Carboranes possess unusual properties which, in principle, make them highly attractive species to incorporate into <b>optoelectronically</b> active materials, although they have been largely untested as components of organic electronic devices. An uncommon three-dimensional delocalised bonding motif infers upon carboranes extreme thermal and chemical stability and a strong electron-withdrawing nature, traits that, if correctly exploited, could potentially lead to organic semiconductors with improved stabilities and optimised electronic properties. This thesis reports a number of approaches to the incorporation of carborane into semiconducting polymers. In the first, ortho-carborane is directly fused to the aromatic backbone via both carbon atoms. The novel difunctionalisation of benzocarborane, and its subsequent incorporation into two previously unreported polymer systems, is reported. Copolymerisation with electron-rich and electron-poor comonomers established that the incorporation of benzocarborane did not prevent electronic delocalisation along the polymer backbone, and that it acted as a mildly electron withdrawing comonomer. P-type behaviour in organic field effect transistors was observed. Based on these results, a second-generation monomer unit was synthesised, incorporating two fused thienyl rings and facilitating observable improvements in molecular ordering and charge-transporting behaviour. The second approach focuses on the attachment of carborane to the conjugated polymer backbone via the functionalisation of one of its carbon atoms, either directly or via a vinylene spacer. Hence carborane functionalised benzodithiophene monomers were prepared via a novel method of carborane C-arylation, before subsequent polymerisation with a range of electron accepting comonomers. The resultant polymers demonstrate OFET performance higher than that reported for non-carborane containing equivalents and exhibit promising solar cell performance. The final chapter details the attachment of various carboranes onto two polythiophene systems via a vinylene linker. Through careful consideration of carborane and vinyl bond stereochemistries, and pendant group spacing it was observed that optical, material, OFET and OPV properties of the resultant polymers could be controlled.

Chemo - chromic devices {{have been developed to}} detect hydrogen gas in several embodiments. Because hydrogen is odorless and colorless and poses an explosion hazard, there is an emerging need for sensors to quickly and accurately detect low levels of leaking hydrogen in fuel cells and other advanced energy- generating systems in which hydrogen is used as fuel. The device incorporates a chemo - chromic pigment into a base polymer. The article can reversibly or irreversibly change color upon exposure to hydrogen. The irreversible pigment changes color from a light beige to a dark gray. The sensitivity of the pigment can be tailored to its application by altering its exposure to gas through the incorporation of one or more additives or polymer matrix. Furthermore, through the incorporation of insulating additives, the chemochromic sensor can operate at cryogenic temperatures as low as 78 K. A chemochromic detector of this type can be manufactured into any feasible polymer part including injection molded plastic parts, fiber-spun textiles, or extruded tapes. The detectors are simple, inexpensive, portable, and do not require an external power source. The chemochromic detectors were installed and removed easily at the KSC launch pad without need for special expertise. These detectors may require an external monitor such as the human eye, camera, or electronic detector; however, they could be left in place, unmonitored, and examined later for color change to determine whether there had been exposure to hydrogen. In one type of envisioned application, chemochromic detectors would be fabricated as outer layers (e. g., casings or coatings) on high-pressure hydrogen storage tanks and other components of hydrogen-handling systems to provide visible indications of hydrogen leaks caused by fatigue failures or other failures in those systems. In another type of envisioned application, chemochromic detectors of this type could be <b>optoelectronically</b> instrumented for monitoring to provide measured digital indications of color changes indicative of the presence of hydrogen...|$|E
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{continuous}} and natural motion, fluidic elastomer actuators (FEAs) have shown potential {{in a range}} of robotic applications including prosthetics and orthotics. Despite their advantages and rapid developments, robots using these actuators still have several challenging issues to be addressed. First, the reliable production of low cost and complex actuators that can apply high forces is necessary, yet none of existing fabrication methods are both easy to implement and of high force output. Next, compliant or stretchable sensors that can be embedded into their bodies for sophisticated functions are required, however, many of these sensors suffer from hysteresis, fabrication complexity, chemical safety and environmental instability, and material incompatibility with soft actuators. Finally, feedback control for FEAs is necessary to achieve better performance, but most soft robots are still “open-loop”. In this dissertation, I intend to help solve the above issues and drive the applications of soft robotics towards hand orthotics and prosthetics. First, I adapt rotational casting as a new manufacturing method for soft actuators. I present a cuboid soft actuator that can generate a force of > 25 N at its tip, a near ten-fold increase over similar actuators previously reported. Next, I propose a soft orthotic finger with position control enabled via embedded optical fiber. I monitor both the static and dynamic states via the optical sensor and achieve the prescribed curvatures accurately and with stability by a gain-scheduled proportional-integral-derivative controller. Then I develop the soft orthotic fingers into a low-cost, closed-loop controlled, soft orthotic glove that can be worn by a typical human hand and helpful for grasping light objects, while also providing finger position control. I achieve motion control with inexpensive, binary pneumatic switches controlled by a simple finite-state-machine. Finally, I report the first use of stretchable optical waveguides for strain sensing in a soft prosthetic hand. These optoelectronic strain sensors are easy to fabricate, chemically inert, and demonstrate low hysteresis and high precision in their output signals. I use the <b>optoelectronically</b> innervated prosthetic hand to conduct various active sensation experiments inspired by the capabilities of a real hand...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Branched macromolecules or dendrimers have {{provided}} a rich seam of research {{in terms of both}} innovative chemistry and applications. 1 - 14 For example, dendrimers have been studied for use as low-dielectric materials, 15 as templates for the growth of single-wall carbon nanotubes, 16 as catalysts, 17 - 19 and in biological applications, 20 - 23 including biosensors, 24 magnetic resonance imaging, 25 - 28 and drug delivery. 29 - 33 However, it has only been more recently that such macromolecular structures have been explored in terms of their electronic and optoelectronic properties, which is the focus of this series of reviews. For example, charge-transporting dendrimers have become an important class of organic semiconducting material 34 and significant effort has focused on light harvesting and energy transfer from a peripheral dye or chromophore to an emissive dye at the center or focus of the dendrimer. 35 - 39 Organic semiconductors have become increasingly important as the active component in applications including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), 40 - 42 transistors, 43, 44 photovoltaic (PV) cells, 45, 46 optical amplifiers, 47, 48 and lasers. 49 - 51 Traditionally, organic semiconductors have fallen into two main classes, small molecules and polymers, and these materials and their applications will be covered in detail by other authors. Small molecules are generally processed by evaporation techniques and have the advantages that the structure−property relationships are relatively simple to understand, the materials are mono(disperse), and they are deposited in a pure form. On the other hand, conjugated polymers are soluble and can be deposited from solution by processes such as spin-coating and ink-jet printing, which opens up the exciting prospect of simple, fast, large-area, low-temperature device manufacturing. An additional advantage for conjugated polymers is that solution processing is potentially less wasteful of material than evaporation for devices that require patterning. However, {{it is often difficult to}} control the polydispersity, molecular weight, backbone defects, and end groups of conjugated polymers reproducibly. Branched macromolecules, known as dendrimers, also have the advantage of being solution processable but by careful design can incorporate the control over the optoelectronic properties that is reminiscent of small molecules. In addition, the dendritic architecture provides a number of other attractive properties, including the ability to independently control the processing and optoelectronic properties; providing the processing power to enable simple chromophores to be deposited as stable amorphous films; dendrimer generation as a tool for controlling the intermolecular interactions that govern device performance; and the ability in well-defined dendrimers to have high chemical purity. In this review, we will focus on synthetic strategies that have been investigated for the preparation of <b>optoelectronically</b> active solution-processable dendritic materials and concentrate on two different applications, namely OLEDs and solar cells, in which they have been used. In the context of OLEDs, we limit the discussion to light emission, as branched macromolecules for charge transport will be discussed in the review by Shirota. We will also briefly comment on other recent light-emitting and -absorbing branched molecular materials that have been used in OLEDs and solar cells...|$|E
40|$|Harvesting energy {{directly}} from the Sun is a very attractive, but not an easy way of providing mankind with energy. Efficient, cheap, lightweight, flexible, and environmentally friendly solar panels are very desirable. Conjugated polymers bear the potential of fulfilling these requisites. Due to their unique chemical makeup, these polymers {{can be used as}} <b>optoelectronically</b> active materials, e. g., they can be optically excited and can transport charge carriers. As compared to inorganic materials, polymers have (at least) one serious drawback: upon light absorption excitons are formed, rather than free charge carriers. A second material is needed to break up these excitons. A much used way of achieving this is to mix the polymer with a material that readily accepts the electrons, leaving the holes in the polymer phase. As excitons in the polymer phase only move around for a couple of nanometers before they decay to the ground state, it is vital to induce a morphology that is characterized by intimate mixing of both materials (a so-called bulk heterojunction or BHJ). A typical BHJ solar cell consists of a glass substrate coated with a transparent electrode, the active layer, and a metallic top electrode. The active layer is formed by spin casting a co-solution of the polymer and the electron accepting material. The voltage for which the current in the external circuit is zero is called the open-circuit voltage Voc. The current density that flows out of the solar cell at zero bias is named the short-circuit current density Jsc. These two important quantities are described in the following. Although significant progress has been made, the efficiency of current BHJ solar cells still does not warrant commercialization. Targeted improvement is hindered by limited understanding of the factors that determine the performance. The main theme of this thesis is to introduce a simple model for the electrical characteristics of BHJ solar cells relating their performance to basic physics and material properties such as charge carrier mobilities. The metal-insulator-metal (MIM) model, as introduced in this work, describes the generation and transport processes in the BHJ as if occurring in one virtual semiconductor. Drift and diffusion of charge carriers, the effect of charge density on the electric field, bimolecular recombination, and a temperature- and field-dependent generation mechanism of free charges are incorporated. By using (values close to) measured charge carrier mobilities, the experimental current-voltage characteristics are regained by the MIM model, showing the soundness of this approach. Although bimolecular recombination in organic semiconductors can be adequately described by Langevin’s equation, meaning that the recombination strength depends on the sum of the charge carrier mobilities, BHJs behave differently. As is known from direct measurements, the bimolecular recombination strength in BHJs is significantly smaller than predicted by the Langevin equation. From the modeling of current-voltage characteristics, it is found that the bimolecular recombination strength is indeed significantly reduced, and is governed by the mobility of the slowest charge carrier and not by the sum of the mobilities. The MIM model sheds new light on two key parameters of BHJ solar cells: the open-circuit voltage and the short-circuit current. By studying the dependence of Voc on incident light intensity, it is established that BHJs behave differently than inorganic p-n junctions. Within the framework of the MIM model, an alternative explanation for the open-circuit voltage is presented. Based on the notion that the quasi-Fermi potentials are constant throughout the device, a formula for Voc is derived that consistently describes the open-circuit voltage. In short, if suitable electrodes are applied to the active layer, Voc is determined by the energy levels of both materials. The energy needed to dissociate excitons represents an important loss in Voc. Simple analytical expressions for the current that can be drawn from a photoconductor indicate that the short-circuit current density should be equal to qGL, where q is the elementary charge, G the generation rate of free electrons and holes, and L is the thickness of the active layer. In this case, Jsc is proportional (through G) to the intensity I of light incident on the device. This linear dependence has been observed in many systems. A small deviation from linearity, in which case Jsc µ Iα with 0. 85 ≤ α ≤ 1, was also reported for various systems. This sublinear behavior was ascribed to bimolecular recombination. In the 1970 ’s Goodman and Rose pointed out that the photocurrent can become limited by space charge, provided that the active layer be thick enough and there exists a difference between electron and hole mobilities. Under these premises, the photocurrent is expected to be proportional to I 0. 75. This suggests that the exponent α {{is a function of the}} charge carrier mobilities and that the sublinear behavior is caused by space-chargebuildup. Numerical modeling and measurements on a suitable BHJ system confirm that the intensity dependence of Jsc is indeed governed by space charge rather than by bimolecular recombination per se. Hybrid organic/inorganic solar cells, are an auspicious alternative to polymer/ fullerene devices. In this case, an inorganic semiconductor, either titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, is used as the electron acceptor. One way of making these cells is the precursor route: A precursor for the inorganic semiconductor is mixed with the solution of the polymer. Upon spin casting of the active layer in ambient conditions, the precursor reacts with moisture from the air and the inorganic semiconductor is formed. Although promising, this method seems to harm the transport of holes through the polymer phase in the active layer. Alternatively, the inorganic semiconductor, in this case zinc oxide, can be formed ex situ in the form of nanoparticles. This enables one to control the reaction conditions and purity of the material better. It is demonstrated that the hole transport through the thus-formed blends is not affected by the presence of the zinc oxide nanoparticles. The electron mobility in blends with the often used conjugated polymer MDMO-PPV is quite decent and, consequently, the hole transport through the polymer phase is identified as the limiting factor in these devices. A much pursued way to increase the performance is to increase the amount of photons absorbed by the film by decreasing the band gap of the polymer. Calculations based on the model presented in this work confirm that this would indeed enhance the performance. However, it is demonstrated that the effect of minimizing the energy loss in the electron transfer from the polymer to the acceptor phase is even more beneficial. By combining these two effects—under the premise of just sufficient driving force for exciton dissociation—it turns out, that the optimal band gap of the polymer is 1. 9 eV. This is significantly higher than what is predicted for p-n junction solar cells (1. 4 eV). With balanced charge transport, polymer/fullerene solar cells can reach power conversion efficiencies of at least 10. 8 %. ...|$|E
