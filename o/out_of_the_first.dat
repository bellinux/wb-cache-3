5|$|In the tournaments between 1934 and 1978, 16 teams {{competed in}} each tournament, except in 1938, when Austria was absorbed into Germany after qualifying, leaving the tournament with 15 teams, and in 1950, when India, Scotland, and Turkey withdrew, leaving the tournament with 13 teams. Most of the {{participating}} nations were from Europe and South America, with a small minority from North America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania. These teams were usually defeated easily by the European and South American teams. Until 1982, the only teams from outside Europe and South America to advance <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> round were: USA, semi-finalists in 1930; Cuba, quarter-finalists in 1938; North Korea, quarter-finalists in 1966; and Mexico, quarter-finalists in 1970.|$|E

Ormerod was forced to step down, as new business figures took control behind the scenes and began to sign promising young Scottish players.

5|$|A Bosman {{transfer}} to Portsmouth followed after three successful seasons at the Berkshire-based club. Initially, Primus struggled {{to break into}} the team and had his progress hindered by injuries. But the 2002–03 season signaled a change in direction as Primus broke into the first team and won Portsmouth fan's player of the season as well as the PFA Fans' Player of the Year for his division. For the next three seasons Primus was in and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> team and worked under three managers: Harry Redknapp, Velimir Zajec and Alain Perrin. The 2006–07 season was the last injury-free season for Primus as a career-threatening knee injury meant he would not make an appearance the following season. Primus went out on loan to former club Charlton and made 10 appearances and one further appearance for Portsmouth before retiring through injury in December 2009. The Milton End stand at Fratton Park was renamed the 'Linvoy Primus Community Stand' because of his outstanding services to the club.|$|E
5|$|After another knee {{operation}} and rehabilitation period, Sayers attempted a comeback for the 1971 season. He was kept <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> three games after carrying the ball only {{twice in the}} preseason, as Bears head coach Jim Dooley planned to slowly work {{him back into the}} rotation. His first game back was against the New Orleans Saints on October 10, in which he carried eight times for 30 yards. After the game, he told reporters he was satisfied with his performance and that his knee felt fine. The following week, against the 49ers, he carried five times before injuring his ankle in the first quarter, an injury that ultimately caused him to miss the remainder of the season. He was encouraged to retire but decided to give football one last try. Sayers' final game was in the 1972 preseason in which he fumbled twice in three carries; he retired from professional football days later.|$|E

5|$|Allardyce {{was offered}} a {{contract}} by Norwich City manager John Bond, but the offer was bettered by Colin Addison at Derby County, and he verbally agreed a three-year contract with Derby. However, before signing the contract he received a late offer from Ken Knighton to play for Sunderland on a £300 a week contract with a £20,000 signing on fee – which more than quadrupled his wage at Bolton. Knighton appointed him as club captain. However Allardyce soon wearied of the long-distance travel from Sunderland {{to his home in}} Bolton, and put in a transfer request when chairman Tom Cowie refused to help finance the purchase of a home in Sunderland. Cowie sacked Knighton late in the 1980–81 season, leaving caretaker manager Mick Docherty in charge to steer the club <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>First</b> Division relegation zone. New manager Alan Durban left Allardyce out of the team {{at the start of the}} 1981–82 campaign, leaving Allardyce's departure from Roker Park inevitable.|$|E
5|$|As third seed, the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in {{the first}} round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs. The series drew much media {{attention}} as Vince Carter, a former Raptor who left Toronto under acrimonious circumstances two seasons ago, was now back at the ACC as a Net. In the opening game, while Carter was constantly booed by the home crowd and was not an offensive threat, Toronto's inexperience was evident as they too struggled offensively and were down 65–78 going into the fourth quarter. A late rally by Toronto in the fourth quarter was not enough as they eventually lost 91–96. The Raptors won game 2 89–83 at the ACC to tie the series 1–1, as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game-high 13 rebounds. The Nets won games 3 and 4 to lead 3–1, but Toronto forced a game 6 when they narrowly won 98–96 in game 5. In that game, the Raptors set two post-season franchise records: most number of points going into halftime and biggest lead for a half. The attendance for the game was also a franchise record for a playoff game. In game 6, however, New Jersey won 98–97, sealing the series 4–2 and sending Toronto <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> round.|$|E
5|$|Despite her {{inability}} to take a wicket in the WNCL, Ebsary was retained in the national team {{and in the next}} five months of international cricket, she did not bowl a ball. Ahead of the 2009 World Cup, the Australians headed to New Zealand for a Rose Bowl series, Ebsary was left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two ODIs against New Zealand, but was recalled for the next two matches at Seddon Park in Hamilton. She scored 30 from 47 balls in the first match before making her ODI top-score of 86 the next day. Batting at No. 3, she struck nine boundaries and faced only 76 balls, scoring at faster than a run-a-ball. This helped set up Australia's 4/307 and they went on to win by 44 runs, their second consecutive victory. The teams returned to Australia where Ebsary made her T20 international debut at the Sydney Cricket Ground. She did not bat or bowl in a rain-affected Australian win.|$|E
