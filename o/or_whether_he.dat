5|$|Very {{little is}} known about Israel's early life. Michael Lapidge dates his birth to around 900, while Wood places it {{slightly}} earlier, around 890. He was a disciple of Ambrose and spent time at Rome, but it is unknown who Ambrose was <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was Israel's tutor in Rome. In Wood's view Israel was a monk at Saint-Maximin in Trier in the 930s.|$|E
5|$|Crassus {{was given}} a praetorship, and {{assigned}} six new legions {{in addition to the}} two formerly consular legions of Gellius and Lentulus, giving him an estimated army of some 32,000–48,000 trained Roman infantrymen plus their attached auxiliaries (there being quite a historical range in the size of Republican Legions). Crassus treated his legions with harsh, even brutal, discipline, reviving the punishment of unit decimation within his army. Appian is uncertain whether he decimated the two consular legions for cowardice when he was appointed their commander, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> had his entire army decimated for a later defeat (an event in which up to 4,000 legionaries would have been executed).|$|E

5|$|She {{suffered}} another serious financial setback in 1835 {{when she}} {{lost most of}} her life savings, about £300, in a bad investment. Sources differ somewhat on what exactly went wrong. Deborah Cadbury says that she invested with a conman who swindled her and disappeared with the money, but Shelley Emling writes that {{it is not clear whether}} the man ran off with the money <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> died suddenly leaving Anning with no way to recover the investment. Concerned about her financial situation, her old friend William Buckland persuaded the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the British government to award her an annuity, known as a civil list pension, in return for her many contributions to the science of geology. The £25 annual pension gave her a certain amount of financial security.|$|E
5|$|Slaughter's {{political}} career {{began in earnest}} with his 1797 election to the Kentucky House of Representatives representing Mercer County. He {{was named to the}} Committee on Enrollments, and probably served as chair, since he delivered the committee's reports to the Assembly. It is unclear whether he did not seek re-election in 1798, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was defeated in that year's canvass. Whatever the case, he filled the space of his legislative hiatus by serving as trustee of the newly incorporated Harrodsburg Academy. He was re-elected to the state House in 1799. In addition to the Committee on Enrollments, he served on the Committee on Privileges and Elections and a joint committee that reported {{on the state of the}} Auditor's, Treasurer's, and Registrar's offices. Records show that he also served as chairman when the House sat as a committee of the whole on November 25, 1799.|$|E

In 1040, a Michael Gabras {{was one of the}} leaders of a failed aristocratic conspiracy against the Domestic of the Schools Constantine, a brother of Emperor Michael IV (r. 1034–1041).

5|$|Vietnamese and French {{historians have}} {{fiercely}} debated Định's choice {{to disregard the}} treaty. The effectiveness of Định's insurgency led French officials to claim that Tự Đức was secretly assisting him, thereby violating the treaty, a pretext the French used to seize three more provinces in 1867. Vietnamese records dispute this, contending that Tự Đức attempted to ensure Định's compliance with the treaty. Định's defiance of the emperor has led historians to debate whether his actions were motivated by {{a rejection of the}} monarch's authority <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> disobeyed in an attempt to help Tự Đức. Định remains widely respected among Vietnamese of all political persuasions. During the Vietnam War, communist historians sought to portray the Việt Cộng as Định's modern successor.|$|E
5|$|During {{his early}} years as a practising barrister, Garrow was {{particularly}} noted for his aggressive and confrontational style of cross-examination. When James Wingrove was charged with theft and violence {{in the course of}} a highway robbery in 1784, Garrow's cross-examination of William Grove (who acted as a witness and the person charging Wingrove) got him to admit that he was perjuring himself in an attempt to get a reward, and that Wingrove had not robbed the two injured parties. Garrow showed a dislike of most thief-takers, of which Grove was one, although he did not treat the Bow Street Runners and other professionals with contempt. His dislike of such men was highlighted in his defence of three men in 1788 for theft; they were charged with assaulting John Troughton, putting him in fear of his life, and stealing his hat. The issue was whether the assault put him in fear of his life, <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was exaggerating to claim a reward, which could not be claimed for simple theft. Garrow established that Troughton was uncertain about how he lost his hat, despite his attempts to claim that the defendants knocked it off him, and after four witnesses gave character evidence the defendants were found not guilty.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after his}} consecration, John bought Bath Abbey's grounds from the king, {{as well as}} the city of Bath itself. Whether John paid Rufus for the town <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was given the town as a gift by the king is unclear. The abbey had {{recently}} lost its abbot Alfsige, and was according to Domesday Book the owner of large estates in and near the town. It would have been the wealth of the abbey that attracted John to take over the monastery. By acquiring the town of Bath, John also acquired the mint that was in the town. In 1090 he transferred the seat, or administration, of the bishopric to Bath Abbey, probably as an attempt to increase the revenues of his see. Bath was a rich abbey, and Wells had always been a poor diocese. By taking over the abbey, John increased his episcopal revenues. William of Malmesbury portrays the moving of the episcopal seat as motivated by a desire for the lands of the abbey, but {{it was part of a}} pattern at the time of moving cathedral seats from small villages to larger towns. When John moved his episcopal seat, he also took over the abbey of Bath as his cathedral chapter, turning his diocese into a bishopric served by monks instead of the canons located at Wells that had previously served the diocese.|$|E

5|$|Bath was ravaged in {{the power}} {{struggle}} between the sons of William the Conqueror following his death in 1087. The victor, William II Rufus, granted the city to a royal physician, John of Tours, who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath. Shortly after his consecration John bought Bath Abbey's grounds from the king, {{as well as the}} city of Bath itself. Whether John paid Rufus for the city <b>or</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> was given it as a gift by the king is unclear. The abbey had recently lost its abbot, Ælfsige, and according to Domesday Book was the owner of large estates in and near the city; it was likely the abbey's wealth that attracted John to take over the monastery.

John rebuilt the monastic church at Bath, which had been damaged during one of Robert de Mowbray's rebellions. Permission was given to move the see of Somerset from Wells– a comparatively small settlement– to the then walled city of Bath.|$|E
