40|$|Modern {{semiconductor}} fabrication facilities {{depend on}} automated material handling systems (AMHSs) {{to manage the}} processes and variations in time required to produce advanced semiconductor products. Unified AMHSs, which operate <b>overhead</b> <b>hoist</b> transport vehicles, support direct tool-to-tool transfers between different bays. AMHSs continue to use static routing, but dynamic routing schemes have been studied to improve traffic conditions. In this dissertation, we propose an approach integrating optimization and simulation to design a track layout of an AMHS employing dynamic routing.

The problem requires input data, especially a base graph and commodities, reflecting realistic traffic conditions. We use simulation to validate the design from the optimization problem and provide its input data. We obtain a solution design using a heuristic that combines optimization and simulation.

40|$|In {{semiconductor}} manufacturing, automated {{material handling}} systems (AMHSs) transport wafers through a complex re-entrant manufacturing process. In some systems, <b>Overhead</b> <b>Hoist</b> Transport (OHT) vehicles move throughout the facility on a ceiling-mounted track system, delivering wafers to machines and storage locations. To improve efficiency in such systems, this thesis proposes an adaptive dynamic routing approach {{that allows the}} system to self-regulate, reducing steady-state travel times by 4 - 6 % and avoiding excessive congestion and deadlock. Our approach allows vehicles to be rerouted while in progress in response {{to changes in the}} location and severity of congestion as measured by edge traversal time estimates updated via exponential smoothing. Our proposed method is efficient enough to be used in a large system where several routing decisions are made each second. We also consider how the effectiveness of a AMHS layout differs between static and dynamic routing. We demonstrate that dynamic routing significantly reduces sensitivity to shortcut placement and allows an eight-fold {{increase in the number of}} shortcuts along the center loop. This reduces travel times by an additional 24 %. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed routing approach, we use a high-fidelity simulation of vehicle movement. To test the impact of routing methods on layout effectiveness, we developed an associated Excel-based automated layout generation tool that allows the efficient generation of thousands of candidate layouts. The user selects from among a set of modular templates to create a design and all simulation files are generated with the click of a button. Ph. D...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} couple of years, a high level of {{automation}} was integrated in the factories of semiconductor industry. This implies the whole production process as well as the material delivery process. An automated material handling system (AMHS) is such an integrated automated transport solution of today's 300 mm semiconductor waferfabs. These AMHS are based on a direct delivery approach (unified) model with alternative flexible storage systems to handle surges of lots in process or unplanned events. As the 300 mm fabs are very large and the number or process and handling steps is rising, a fast and reliable transport system with short delivery times is required which, in addition, minimizes its footprint inside the expensive clean room. Currently, the implemented transport solutions are based on <b>overhead</b> <b>hoist</b> vehicles (OHV) which have to cope with several problems. On one hand there is an increasing traffic on the whole track system caused by the increasing number of process steps. On the other hand there is a higher number of hoist-actions as a result of new storage strategies. Instead of large central stockers, distributed tool assigned Under Track Storages (UTS) are used. Both issues mentioned can result in vehicles blocking track sections frequently. This can cuase accumulations which lead to high variances in delivery times and make the delivery time for loads in this system less predictable. An additional effect might be the increased idle times of expensive process equipments, which need to minimized. This paper describes an approach of dynamic vehicle routing and identifies simulation based improvements of the AMHS performance. Furthermore different vehicle routing strategies are presented and compared...|$|E

40|$|We {{show how}} to limit a program’s {{resource}} usage in an efficient way, using a novel combination of dynamic checks and static analysis. Usually, dynamic checking is inefficient, {{due to the}} overhead of checks, while static analysis is difficult and rejects many safe programs. We propose a hybrid approach that solves these problems. We split each resource-consuming operation into two parts. The first part is a dynamic check, called reserve. The second part is the actual operation, called consume, which does not perform any dynamic checks. The programmer is then free to hoist and combine reserve operations. Combining reserve operations reduces their <b>overhead,</b> while <b>hoisting</b> reserve operations ensures that the program does not run out of resources at an inconvenient time. A static verifier ensures that the program reserves resources before it consumes them. This verification is both easier and more flexible than a priori static verification of resource usage.

40|$|Abstract: The {{behavior}} of many mechanical systems, such as overhead cranes, can be predicted through intuitive observation of their motion under various forces. Mathematical modeling of an overhead crane {{shows that it}} is highly coupled. Nonetheless, it is surprisingly easy for an experienced crane operator to drive payloads to target positions with minimal cable swing. This observation naturally promotes the use of fuzzy logic to control overhead cranes. Traditionally, fuzzy logic controllers of overhead cranes were presented for specific crane system/motion parameters. This work presents a novel approach for automatically creating anti-swing fuzzy logic controllers for <b>overhead</b> cranes with <b>hoisting.</b> The model of the crane includes the distributed mass of the cable. The presented approach uses the inverse dynamics of the overhead crane and the desired motion parameters to determine the ranges of the variables of the controllers.
