5|$|A {{circumstance}} {{occurred during}} the action which so strongly marks the invincible spirit of British seamen, when engaging the enemies of their country, that I cannot resist the pleasure I have in making it known to their Lordships; the Temeraire was boarded by accident; or design, by a French ship <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> Spaniard on the other; the contest was vigorous, but, {{in the end the}} combined ensigns were torn from the poop and the British hoisted in their places. Collingwood's account, probably based largely on Harvey's report {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the battle, contained several errors. Temeraire had closely engaged two French ships, rather than a French and a Spanish ship, and had not been boarded by either during the action. Nevertheless, the account was popular and a print was rushed out purporting to show Harvey taking the lead in clearing Temeraires decks of enemy seamen.|$|E
5|$|They fought alone, or in bands {{composed}} of {{individuals from the}} same area. Thus {{it was thought that}} the zduhaći from eastern Bosnia fought together against those from Herzegovina and Montenegro. The zduhaći from Sandžak fought jointly against the Albanian zduhaći. On the Adriatic coast, battles were waged between a band of zduhaći from Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, and northern Albania <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> band of zduhaći from Apulia in southeast Italy on the other side. The latter were also called the transmarine zduhaći, as Apulia is situated across the Adriatic Sea from Montenegro. Each band had its leader. A man named Mato Glušac (1774–1870), from the village of Korita in Herzegovina, was reputed the supreme commander of the Herzegovinian and Montenegrin zduhaći; he was also a famous seer.|$|E
5|$|Efforts {{to promote}} a {{commemorative}} coin for the exposition began around January 1892. They were strongly advocated {{by the head of}} the Company's Committee on Liberal Arts, James Ellsworth, who was particularly interested as he had recently purchased a 16th-century painting by Lorenzo Lotto of a learned man, said to be Columbus. Ellsworth wanted the portrait to be the basis of the coin. In this, he was advised by author and journalist William Eleroy Curtis, also a fair official. In April 1892, partisans had gained the support of the Director of the Bureau of the Mint, Edward O. Leech, who envisioned a coin carrying a visage of Columbus <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side,</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> suitable inscription on the other. Curtis was well aware of the difficulties with the Mint's failed competition for new silver coins in 1891, which had led to the issuance of the Barber coinage, designed by Mint Chief Engraver Charles E. Barber. The new coins were widely criticized, and Curtis counseled Ellsworth to gain control of the commemorative coin's design process, to ensure both a better design {{and the use of the}} Lotto portrait. No United States coin had depicted an actual person, although the goddess of Liberty had often been portrayed.|$|E

25|$|Many older {{structures}} were fabricated by inserting red-hot rivets into pre-drilled holes; the soft rivets are then peened using an air hammer <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> bucking {{bar on the}} head end. As these cool slowly, they are left in an annealed (soft) condition, while the plate, having been hot rolled and quenched during manufacture, remains relatively hard. Under extreme stress the hard plates can shear the soft rivets, resulting in failure of the joint.|$|E
25|$|Sandstone slip gate piers {{are found}} at the bottom entry point to the Buchans field beside the {{pedestrian}} footpath. Such slip gates were built {{with a series of}} downward facing 'L'-shaped grooves <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> matching concavity on the other gatepost. Wood bars could then be inserted across and parallel, giving a gate without a hinge. These are sometimes still found in the countryside at large, but they are almost always adapted to carry metal hinged gates. In some areas wood rather than stone was used to construct this type of hinge-less gatepost.|$|E

25|$|The median nerve can be {{compressed}} by {{a decrease}} {{in the size of the}} canal, an increase in the size of the contents (such as the swelling of lubrication tissue around the flexor tendons), or both. Since the carpal tunnel is bordered by carpal bones <b>on</b> <b>one</b> <b>side</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> ligament on the other, when the pressure builds up inside the tunnel, there is nowhere for it to escape and thus it ends up pressing up against and damaging the median nerve. Simply flexing the wrist to 90 degrees will decrease the size of the canal.|$|E
