In Fig.  4, we present {{the relative}} importance of the following foreign currency movements for (R 1), (R 2) and (R 3): (1) total exports from Guatemala (Fig.  4 a); (2) total imports to Guatemala (Fig.  4 b); (3) receipt of loans to Guatemala (Fig.  4 c); (4) payment of loans from Guatemala (Fig.  4 d); (5) remittance payments to Guatemala (Fig.  4 e). For all cases, we compute relative importance with respect to the sum of total inflows and total <b>outflows</b> <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>currency,</b> and we estimate average relative importance separately for each month. We find that {{the relative importance}} of total exports, on average, significantly decreases from (R 1) to (R 2) and (R 3) (Fig.  4 a). Furthermore, we also find that {{the relative importance of}} loans and remittance payments that do not have a significant seasonality component, on average, significantly increases from (R 1) to (R 3) (Fig.  4 c–e). These results also support the reducing amplitude of GTQ/USD seasonality for the data window.|$|E

The income from the international tourism for many countries in the world, especially for the countries in development represents an important factor for the development not only for the tourism economy but the overall economy.

50|$|The {{flight from}} {{domestic}} money {{depends on a}} country's institutional factors. The first factor {{is the level of}} development of the domestic financial market. An economy with a well-developed financial market can offer a set of alternative financial instruments denominated in domestic currency, reducing the role <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> as an inflation hedge. The pattern of the currency substitution process also varies across countries with different foreign exchange and capital controls. In a country with strict foreign exchange regulations, the demand for <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> will be satisfied in the holding <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> assets abroad and outside the domestic banking system. This demand often puts pressure on the parallel market <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>currency</b> and on the country's international reserves. Evidence for this pattern is given in the absence of currency substitution during the pre-reform period in most transition economies, because of constricted controls on foreign exchange and the banking system. In contrary, by facilitating the domestic holding <b>of</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>currency,</b> a country might mitigate the shift of assets abroad and strengthen its external reserves in exchange for a currency substitution process. However, the effect of this regulation on the pattern of currency substitution depends on the public's expectations of macroeconomic stability and the sustainability <b>of</b> the <b>foreign</b> exchange regime.|$|R
