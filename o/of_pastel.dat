25|$|Custard tarts {{were first}} {{introduced}} in Hong Kong in the 1940s through cha chaan tengs. Hong Kong egg tarts are the adaptations <b>of</b> <b>pastel</b> de nata, popular in Macau. Canton (modern Guangdong) had more frequent {{contact with the}} West, particularly with Britain and Portugal, {{than the rest of}} China. Also, being a neighbour of Macau, Hong Kong has adopted some of the Macanese cuisine.|$|E
25|$|In São Paulo, {{a typical}} dish is virado à paulista, made with rice, tutu de feijão, sauteed kale, and pork. São Paulo {{is also the}} home <b>of</b> <b>pastel,</b> a food {{consisting}} of thin pastry envelopes wrapped around assorted fillings, then deep fried in vegetable oil. It is a common belief that they originated when Japanese immigrants adapted the recipe of fried spring rolls to sell as snacks at weekly street markets.|$|E
25|$|The Foxfield Races are {{a longstanding}} University of Virginia tradition. Some chide the event as the {{pinnacle}} {{representation of the}} upper middle class nature of UVA’s student demographic. Students use Race Day {{as an excuse to}} break out their “preppiest” attire. There is an abundance <b>of</b> <b>pastel</b> colors, Lilly Pulitzer patterns, and large sun hats. Girls are found wearing sundresses and many boys don a colorful bowtie for the occasion. Students tailgate at plots which are often organized through Greek organizations or other student groups.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Painting (1946) sold to Alfred Barr for the Museum of Modern Art in New York for £240. Bacon {{wrote to}} Sutherland asking that he apply {{fixative}} to the patches <b>of</b> <b>pastel</b> on Painting (1946) {{before it was}} shipped to New York. Painting (1946) is now too fragile to be moved from MoMA for exhibition elsewhere. At least one visit to Paris in 1946 brought Bacon into more immediate contact with French postwar painting and Left Bank ideas such as Existentialism. He had, by this time, embarked on his lifelong friendship with Isabel Rawsthorne, a painter closely involved with Giacometti and the Left Bank set. They shared many interests including ethnography and classical literature.|$|E
25|$|A typical episode {{features}} several vignettes of {{the everyday}} life of a couple, with the camera mostly centered on them. Often other characters are cropped, giving the programme its unique visual style. The couple receive friends for supper, go to the convenience store, or leave on a trip, and sometimes get on each other's nerves. Their quirks, and loving bickering, provide much of the program's humor. The graphic design style associated with the original Un gars, une fille, which consists of a palette <b>of</b> <b>pastel</b> blue and pink, and rough lines and scribbles, (seen in the transition graphics, see Original section), {{as well as a}} logo with simulated printing mistakes and smears, has been imitated by most of the other versions, with the notable exception of the American version. The character names are often those of the actors, as in the first version.|$|E
500|$|Christ and {{the disciples}} {{are placed in}} a semicircle, {{reflecting}} {{the shape of the}} chapel's apse. The tax collector, on the other hand, stands outside the holy space. While the group of holy men are dressed almost entirely in robes <b>of</b> <b>pastel</b> pink and blue, the official wears a shorter tunic of a striking vermilion. The colour adds to the impertinence expressed through his gestures. Another way contrast is achieved is in the way [...] both in the central scene and on the right [...] the tax collector's postures are copying almost exactly those of Peter, only seen from the opposite angle. This gives a three-dimensional quality to the figures, allowing the spectator to view them from all sides.|$|E

500|$|... "Hold Tight" [...] is a [...] "reflective and sombre" [...] midtempo pop ballad, having {{atmospheric}} keyboards, military {{drums and}} flourishes <b>of</b> <b>pastel</b> electronics as its main instrumentation. Its [...] "tribal" [...] chorus [...] "gallops euphorically over twinkling arpeggio, picked {{out by a}} Juno whistle", which according to The Quietus Amy Pettifer, is [...] "reminiscent of Kate Bush's 'Running Up that Hill'. John Marrs of Gay Times noted the song's synths remind of [...] "Confessions on a Dance Floor"'s 'Forbidden Love' and the [...] "euphoric instrumentals" [...] of British electronica band Faithless. Lyrically, the song talks about holding on and being strong, with Madonna singing about being [...] "scarred and bruised". For Adam R. Holz of Plugged In, the song permeates in the same lyrical content of [...] "Living for Love", while Pettifer noted that it's [...] "a galvanising anthem of shoulder-to-shoulder survival that's collective and communal, rather than intimate and romantic." ...|$|E
500|$|On its release, Manhunter was {{met with}} widely mixed reviews. At first, it was seen as too stylish, owing largely to Mann's 1980s {{trademark}} use <b>of</b> <b>pastel</b> colors, art-deco architecture and glass brick. A common criticism in the initial reviews was that the film overemphasized the music and stylistic visuals. Petersen's skill as a lead actor was also called into question. Particularly critical of the film's stylistic approach was the New York Times, which called attention to Mann's [...] "taste for overkill", branding his stylized approach as [...] "hokey" [...] and little more than [...] "gimmicks". Chicago Tribune writer Dave Kehr remarked that Mann [...] "believes in style {{so much that he}} has very little belief left over for the characters or situations of his film, which suffers accordingly", adding that the film's focus on style serves to [...] "drain any notion of credibility" [...] from its plot.|$|E

Clapp said [...] "Thelma Barlow played , with exceptional delicacy, {{in a variety}} <b>of</b> <b>pastel</b> pinnies, for 26years." [...] She concluded {{that she had a}} [...] "tumultuous relationship with her soulmate, Derek". When Barlow quit the role as Mavis in 1997, various Coronation Street stars praised her contribution: Sherrie Hewson (who played Maureen Holdsworth) said [...] "Thelma's a wonderful lady and a superb actress. We'll miss her"; Michael Le Vell (Kevin Webster) said [...] "Thelma's quality as an actress shone through for everyone to see after the death of Derek"; Peter Baldwin (Derek) said [...] "It has made a difference to the programme and the departure of Derek and now Mavis is going to upset a lot of viewers".|$|E

2500|$|Hills came {{to prefer}} {{watercolor}} and pastel to oils {{even though these}} media were at the time considered suitable only for preliminary work and were not often exhibited. [...] This situation began to change early in Hills' career, spurred {{in part by the}} founding of national and local watercolor and pastel societies in the late 1800s. Hills had her first solo exhibition in 1889 at the J. Eastman Chase Gallery in Boston, showing a group <b>of</b> <b>pastel</b> landscapes and still lifes. [...] The following year, she showed work at the Boston Water Color Club's Fourth Annual Exhibition, which was also held at the Chase Gallery. She exhibited watercolors and pastels throughout her career, and focused on pastels in her later years as her eyesight began to fail.|$|E
2500|$|The clothes worn on Miami Vice had a {{significant}} influence on men's fashion. They popularized, if not invented, the [...] "T-shirt under Armani jacket"–style, and popularized Italian men's fashion in the United States. Don Johnson's typical attire of Italian sport coat, T-shirt, white linen pants, and slip-on sockless loafers became a hit. Even fine timepiece manufacturers got in on the action. Crockett initially wore an 18k Rolex Day-Date [...] "President" [...] model in the first season, until Ebel won the contract for the remaining seasons. Similarly, Crockett's perpetually unshaven appearance sparked a minor fashion trend, inspiring men to wear {{a small amount of}} beard stubble, also known as a five o'clock shadow (or [...] "designer stubble") at all times. In an average episode, Crockett and Tubbs wore five to eight outfits, appearing in shades of pink, blue, green, peach, fuchsia, and the show's other [...] "approved" [...] colors. Designers such as Vittorio Ricci, Gianni Versace, and Hugo Boss were consulted in keeping the male leads looking trendy. Costume designer Bambi Breakstone, who traveled to Milan, Paris, and London in search of new clothes, said that, [...] "The concept of the show is to be on top of all the latest fashion trends in Europe." [...] Jodi Tillen, the costume designer for the first season, along with Michael Mann, set the style. The abundance <b>of</b> <b>pastel</b> colors on the show reflected Miami's Art-deco architecture.|$|E

2500|$|A {{writer for}} the Video Business {{magazine}} said of Journey to Joke-a-lot: [...] "While [...] ain't no Shrek—the gold standard—the movie is still amusing enough to charm the target demographic of ages 2–5 and should do well with parents looking for harmless kiddie fare." [...] Bruce Kluger of Parenting commented likewise: [...] "The computer animation {{might not be as}} quaint as the pen-and-ink of the 1980s version, but the new songs and brisk pace make this one a keeper for a new generation." [...] In July 2005, Rob Lowing of Sydney, Australia's The Sun-Herald gave it three stars out of five, and wrote: [...] "Adults will find this computer-generated cartoon as sickly sweet as fairy floss but tiny tots will love the colourful blobsoops, we mean the Care Bears. [...] Support characters that look like toys, four bright songs and lots of giggling will score with the under-fives." [...] Saskatchewan's The Star Phoenix also praised the film and its soundtrack, adding that [...] "Even the movie is [...] "bear"-able for grown-ups with subtle adult humour woven into the silliness." [...] But MaryAnn Johanson of the Flick Filosopher called it a [...] "horrifying attempt at children's entertainment", adding that [...] "The cold CGI animation removes any vestige of coziness that might have been found in what is essentially a giant advertisement for itself." [...] She referred to the title setting, Joke-a-lot, as [...] "a sort of Oz-meets-Candyland with just a soupcon <b>of</b> <b>pastel</b> near-oddity Tim Burton might have pondered in a moment of sentimental weakness".|$|E
6000|$|I {{recognised}} {{that this}} was as near as I should ever come, certainly as I should come that night, to pressing on her misfortune. Neither of us would name it more than we were doing then, and Flora would never name it at all. Little by little I saw that what had occurred was, strange as it might appear, {{the best thing for}} her happiness. The question was now only of her beauty and her being seen and marvelled at; with Dawling to do for her everything in life her activity was limited to that. Such an activity was all within her scope; it asked nothing of her that she couldn't splendidly give. As {{from time to time in}} our delicate communion she turned her face to me with the parody of a look I lost none of the signs of its strange new glory. The expression of the eyes was a rub <b>of</b> <b>pastel</b> from a master's thumb; the whole head, stamped with a sort of showy suffering, had gained a fineness from what she had passed through. Yes, Flora was settled for life--nothing could hurt her further. I foresaw the particular praise she would mostly incur--she would be invariably [...] "interesting." [...] She would charm with her pathos more even than she had charmed with her pleasure. For herself above all she was fixed for ever, rescued from all change and ransomed from all doubt. Her old certainties, her old vanities were justified and sanctified, and in the darkness that had closed upon her one object remained clear. That object, as unfading as a mosaic mask, was fortunately the loveliest she could possibly look upon. The greatest blessing of all was of course that Dawling thought so. Her future was ruled with the straightest line, and so for that matter was his. There were two facts to which before I left my friends I gave time to sink into my spirit. One was that he had changed by some process as effective as Flora's change, had been simplified somehow into service as she had been simplified into success. He was such a picture of inspired intervention as I had never yet conceived: he would exist henceforth for the sole purpose of rendering unnecessary, or rather impossible, any reference even on her own part to his wife's infirmity. Oh yes, how little desire he would ever give me to refer to it! He principally after a while made me feel--and this was my second lesson--that, good-natured as he was, my being there to see it all oppressed him; so that by the time the act ended I recognised that I too had filled out my hour. Dawling remembered things; I think he caught in my very face the irony of old judgments: they made him thresh about in his chair. I said to Flora as I took leave of her that I would come to see her, but I may mention that I never went. I'd go to-morrow if I hear she wants me; but what in the world can she ever want? As I quitted them I laid my hand on Dawling's arm, and drew him for a moment into the lobby.|$|E
