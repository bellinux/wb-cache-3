5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice and {{goodness}} can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of accessing the unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only be achieved through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only be achieved by those who practice their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is <b>our</b> <b>spiritual,</b> not physical comprehension of him which is important.|$|E
25|$|I want to {{conclude}} with a few remarks about the domestic scene {{and the role of}} Social Democrats, U.S.A. in it. We are not a political party with our own candidates. We are not alone in our specific programs for more employment, more insurance, more welfare, less discrimination, less bureaucratic inefficiency. <b>Our</b> <b>spiritual</b> task should be to relate these programs and demands to the underlying philosophy of democracy, to express and defend those larger moral ideals that should inform, programs for which we wish to develop popular support.|$|E
25|$|The Alexandrian {{contribution}} to Christian mysticism centers on Origen and Clement of Alexandria. Clement {{was an early}} Christian humanist who argued that reason {{is the most important}} aspect of human existence and that gnosis (not something we can attain by ourselves, but the gift of Christ) helps us find the spiritual realities that are hidden behind the natural world and within the scriptures. Given the importance of reason, Clement stresses apatheia as a reasonable ordering of our passions in order to live within God's love, which is seen as a form of truth. Origen, who had a lasting influence on Eastern Christian thought, further develops the idea that the spiritual realities can be found through allegorical readings of the scriptures (along the lines of Jewish aggadah tradition), but he focuses his attention on the Cross and on the importance of imitating Christ through the Cross, especially through spiritual combat and asceticism. Origen stresses the importance of combining intellect and virtue (theoria and praxis) in <b>our</b> <b>spiritual</b> exercises, drawing on the image of Moses and Aaron leading the Israelites through the wilderness, and he describes our union with God as the marriage of our souls with Christ the Logos, using the wedding imagery from the Song of Songs. Alexandrian mysticism developed alongside Hermeticism and Neoplatonism and therefore share some of the same ideas, images, etc. in spite of their differences.|$|E

2500|$|Clients’ {{religious}} beliefs {{are increasingly being}} considered in psychotherapy {{with the goal of}} improving service and effectiveness of treatment. A resulting development was theistic psychotherapy. Conceptually, it consists of theological principles, a theistic view of personality, and a theistic view of psychotherapy. Following an explicit minimizing strategy, therapists attempt to minimize conflict by acknowledging their religious views while being respectful of client’s religious views. This is argued to up the potential for therapists to directly utilize religious practices and principles in therapy, such as prayer, forgiveness, and grace. [...] In contrast to such an approach, psychoanalyst Robin S. Brown argues for the extent to which <b>our</b> <b>spiritual</b> commitments remain unconscious. [...] Drawing from the work of Jung, Brown suggests that [...] "our biases can only be suspended in {{the extent to which they}} are no longer our biases".|$|E

Bonciu: [...] "From a sty of crude colors, {{with plenty of}} gilded gossamer rubbed into it, his thick and greasy brush [...] paints into the fresco of <b>our</b> <b>spiritual</b> bedlam". Felix Aderca too campaigned for the novel and its [...] "pages of genius". Another notable fan of the book was novelist and literary chronicler Mihail Sebastian, his Trăirist colleague, although he noted that Bonciu's text was not a fully formed novel. The same was concluded by Călinescu, who once described Bonciu the novelist {{as the author of}} [...] "prose poems". Other critics tend to rate Bagaj... as a poorly finished work, insisting on its centrifugal narrative—one such conservative voice was that of Pompiliu Constantinescu, who still saluted Bonciu's decision to move into the genre of [...] "Surreal prose", away from poetry.

2500|$|The Eastern church {{then saw}} the {{development}} of monasticism and the mystical contributions of Gregory of Nyssa, Evagrius Ponticus and Pseudo-Dionysius. Monasticism, also known as anchoritism (meaning [...] "to withdraw") {{was seen as an}} alternative to martyrdom, and was less about escaping the world than about fighting demons (who were thought to live in the desert) and about gaining liberation from our bodily passions in order to be open to the Word of God. Anchorites practiced continuous meditation on the scriptures as a means of climbing the ladder of perfection—a common religious image in the Mediterranean world and one found in Christianity through the story of Jacob's ladder—and sought to fend off the demon of acedia ("un-caring"), a boredom or apathy that prevents us from continuing on in <b>our</b> <b>spiritual</b> training. Anchorites could live in total solitude ("hermits", from the word erēmitēs, [...] "of the desert") or in loose communities ("cenobites", meaning [...] "common life").|$|E
2500|$|Residents {{agreed to}} a strict code of conduct. They {{surrendered}} all personal possessions to the group, which provided food, clothing, and shelter. The rules also forbade consumption of alcohol and tobacco. Although the colony raised chickens in the beginning, eating any meat except fish was later prohibited. Ogden even said they must stop planting gardens, {{but they were still}} permitted to hire out as laborers to local farmers. Ogden received instructions for the settlement through her typewriter as well as in revelatory trips to the top of nearby Shay Mountain. She taught from the Aquarian Gospel and other theosophical works. Her doctrines included reincarnation, communication with the dead, and asceticism. It is said that she claimed to be the reincarnated Virgin Mary, identifying other group members as reincarnations of Brigham Young and the prophet Nathan. However, this was only reported by newspapers and never verified by credible sources from within the commune. Ogden also handled the colony's financial matters. In 1934, she purchased the local newspaper, the San Juan Record, made herself editor, and added a column in which she promoted her metaphysical ideas. In her first column of “Metaphysical Truths”, printed May 24, 1934, she describes metaphysics as [...] "that division of philosophy which relates to the science of being and to the hidden, or unseen things, which pertain to <b>our</b> <b>spiritual</b> rather than our material, or physical being which we KNOW because we are more conscious of the physical senses we have allowed to predominate. It also embraces that which tells you how the Universe came to being, what composes the Universe, and how life started to manifest on it. As one writer states: 'It's the science of exploring the Universe outside of the Finite.'" [...] Additionally, a column called the “Dry Valley News” gave a summary of the goings-on at Home of Truth. She used the press to print pamphlets about her beliefs to distribute out as well.|$|E
