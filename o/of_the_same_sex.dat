5|$|Generally {{when two}} or more rats from the same litter are <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sex</b> they live {{together}} with no disruptions but with the occasional friendly tussle and play fight. Although {{it is possible that}} rats from different litters can be integrated together, the integration process can be easy or hard. Several measures have to be taken to provide security for both rats.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{selection}} as first articulated by Darwin (using {{the example of}} the peacock's tail) refers specifically to competition for mates, which can be intrasexual, between individuals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sex,</b> that is male–male competition, or intersexual, where one gender chooses mates, most often with males displaying and females choosing. However, in some species, mate choice is primarily by males, as in some fishes of the family Syngnathidae.|$|E
5|$|Buczynski welcomed {{a number}} of friends and flatmates, {{including}} Geraci, into the Huntington coven, and later stated his desire to personally initiate Geraci up to the third degree; Saperton disagreed, citing the traditional Gardnerian prohibition on anyone initiating a member <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sex.</b> Buczynski thought that her attitude was homophobic, and subsequently abandoned both her and Gardnerian Wica. Meanwhile, he and Geraci moved out of their crowded apartment into a new flat in Middle Village. Despite same-sex marriage not being legally recognised at the time, they undertook a private wedding ceremony to marry one another, although were non-monogamous, and would go together to gay bath houses to partake in sexual activity with other patrons, resulting in Buczynski's contraction of several sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5000|$|People {{holding hands}} is an {{ordinary}} display of friendship though women and men, but seldom show public affection toward {{the opposite sex}} but are affectionate in private. It is also common for people <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sexes</b> to hold hands, and is often mistakenly viewed as homosexuality to outsiders.|$|R

5|$|Giraffe groups {{tend to be}} sex-segregated {{although}} mixed-sex groups made {{of adult}} females and young males are known to occur. Particularity stable giraffe groups are those made of mothers and their young, which can last weeks or months. Social cohesion in these groups is maintained by the bonds formed between calves. Female association appears {{to be based on}} space-use and individuals may be matrilineally related. In general, females are more selective than males in who they associate with in regards to individuals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sex.</b> Young males also form groups and will engage in playfights. However, as they get older males become more solitary but may also associate in pairs or with female groups. Giraffes are not territorial, but they have home ranges. Male giraffes occasionally wander far from areas that they normally frequent.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sex.</b> For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch. It {{is for this reason that}} anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.|$|E
5|$|Phenotypic traits can be {{displayed}} in one sex and desired {{in the other}} sex, causing a positive feedback loop called a Fisherian runaway, for example, the extravagant plumage of some male birds such as the peacock. An alternate theory proposed by the same Ronald Fisher in 1930 is the sexy son hypothesis, that mothers want promiscuous sons to give them large numbers of grandchildren and so choose promiscuous fathers for their children. Aggression between members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sex</b> is sometimes associated with very distinctive features, such as the antlers of stags, which are used in combat with other stags. More generally, intrasexual selection {{is often associated with}} sexual dimorphism, including differences in body size between males and females of a species.|$|E

5|$|Relay {{races are}} the only track and field event in which a team of runners {{directly}} compete against other teams. Typically, a team {{is made up of}} four runners <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sex.</b> Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over a baton to a teammate, who then begins their leg upon receiving the baton. There is usually a designated area where athletes must exchange the baton. Teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the change within the area, or if the baton is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its runners are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors.|$|E
5|$|Shortly before {{mating season}} begins, females exhibit {{swelling}} of the sex skin, which reaches its peak around {{the middle of their}} 14.8 day estrous cycle. Male sexual physiology also undergoes its own change, with testicular volume increasing during mating season, peaking around the time of breeding. Aggression also increases during the mating season, both between members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sex</b> and by females towards the male attempting to mate with her. Females have been observed grappling, cuffing, and biting the male during copulation. Either sex may approach the other when the female is in estrus. Initially they may roar-shriek with each other. When a male approaches a female he often lowers his head and squeals, inspecting the female's genitalia by licking or sniffing, scent-marking, and offering a submissive chattering vocalization. When a female approaches a male, she may posture herself for mounting. Mating pairs often copulate many times {{during the course of a}} mating bout.|$|E
5|$|The nest {{is usually}} domed, {{though it may}} lack a roof in {{enclosed}} sites. It has an outer layer of stems and roots, a middle layer of dead grass and leaves, and a lining of feathers, {{as well as of}} paper and other soft materials. Nests typically have external dimensions of 20 × 30cm (8 × 12in), but their size varies greatly. The building of the nest is initiated by the unmated male while displaying to females. The female assists in building, but is less active than the male. Some nest building occurs throughout the year, especially after moult in autumn. In colder areas house sparrows build specially created roost nests, or roost in street lights, to avoid losing heat during the winter. House sparrows do not hold territories, but they defend their nests aggressively against intruders <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sex.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 5 February 2013, Drax {{voted in}} <b>the</b> House <b>of</b> Commons against a Second Reading <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Marriage (<b>Same</b> <b>Sex</b> Couples) Act 2013 which legalised {{marriage}} for same-sex couples.|$|R

5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick {{their ears}} whilst sniffing. Playful {{individuals}} will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, {{and raise their}} tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails {{back and forth with}} their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture of fear and aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sex.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{refined and}} expanded from the version they used in Awakening. The My Castle feature was suggested by Maeda {{as an alternative}} activity for players, {{and to provide a}} means for getting to know the main characters outside battle. The amount of content included in the feature made some staff comment that it could be its own game. The social elements of My Castle were originally going to be exclusive to StreetPass, but it was suggested that players in areas with low StreetPass activity should be able to access the functions through a normal Internet connection. Some ideas thought up by Maeda for earlier titles, such as the Dragon Vein ability and the way skills were inherited by second generation characters, were also implemented. Due to the necessity for multiple versions, map designing became a larger task than anticipated, with very few maps being shared between versions. The Phoenix Mode was included to bring new fans into the series, a philosophy that they had neglected up until Awakening and improved for Fates. For {{the first time in the}} Fire Emblem series, the option for the main character to marry a character <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sex</b> was included: the potential male and female partners respectively appear in Conquest and Birthright, and both appear in Revelation. According to Nintendo, this move was done to reflect the diversity of their player base.|$|E
