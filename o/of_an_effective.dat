Nine days later, he had successfully completed the task.|$|E

5|$|Some {{historians have}} claimed that had German {{intruder}} operations been maintained over Britain in 1941, and thereafter, the British night flying training program, which produced {{the nucleus of the}} huge bomber force that operated in 1944–45, could have been halted or disrupted. The decision not to continue intruder operations, in their view, allowed the British to build their bomber force virtually unhindered for over four years. A consequence <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> German intruder campaign at this time may have given the Luftwaffe night fighter defences an unassailable lead in the night war, and may have stopped, or diminished, the effectiveness of British bombing operations. This omission could be {{regarded as one of the}} major errors attributable to the OKL concerning the air defence of Germany.|$|E
5|$|Yorkshire's run {{of success}} ended in 1926 as fierce rivals Lancashire relegated them into second place. Kilner had some {{successful}} matches {{in the season}} and achieved at a consistent level, but his performance showed signs of deteriorating. He scored 1,187 runs at 37.09, the highest seasonal average of his career. He completed the double for the fourth and final time by taking 107 wickets, but his bowling average of 22.52 was his worst since 1920, {{before he became a}} regular bowler. He finished sixth in the Yorkshire batting and third in the bowling averages. He played for the Players for the final time at Lord's, scoring 72, but failed to take a wicket. His final first-class century came against Middlesex, when he compiled 150 {{out of a total of}} 415, dominating the scoring while he was at the crease. During the summer's Ashes series, he was selected for the first four Tests. He only batted twice with a highest score of 36. With the ball, he took seven wickets at 39.42, but the editor of Wisden criticised much of the English bowling; he described Kilner's only notable achievement as quickly ending Australia's innings in the second Test at Lord's. For the final Test, Kilner was dropped in favour of 48-year-old Wilfred Rhodes. According to the chairman of selectors, Pelham Warner, Rhodes was recalled because of the lack <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> alternative left-arm spinner. Rhodes had a successful match and England defeated Australia to win the Ashes for the first time since 1912, but Kilner had played his last Test. In nine Tests, he scored 233 runs at an average of 33.28 and took 24 wickets at 30.58.|$|E

40|$|Using {{multiple}} scattering theory, we derived for {{the first}} time analytical formulas for electrostrictive tensors for two dimensional metamaterial systems. The electrostrictive tensor terms are found to depend explicitly on the symmetry of the underlying lattice of the metamaterial and they also depend explicitly on the direction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local <b>effective</b> wave vector. These analytical results enable us to calculate light induced body forces inside a composite system (metamaterial) using the Helmholtz stress tensor within the effective medium formalism {{in the sense that the}} fields used in the stress tensor are those obtained by solving the macroscopic Maxwell equation with the microstructure of the metamaterial replaced by <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> medium. Our results point to some fundamental questions <b>of</b> using <b>an</b> <b>effective</b> medium theory to determine optical force density. In particular, the fact that Helmholtz tensor carries electrostrictive terms that are explicitly symmetry dependent means that the standard effective medium parameters cannot give sufficient information to determine body force density, even though they can give the correct total force. A more challenging issue is that the electrostrictive terms are related to <b>a</b> local <b>effective</b> wave vector, and it is not always obtainable in systems with boundary reflections within the context <b>of</b> <b>a</b> standard <b>effective</b> medium approach.
