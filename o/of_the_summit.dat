5|$|Volcanic {{activity}} at Kita-dake ended around 4,900years ago: subsequent eruptions have been centered on Minami-dake. Since 2006 activity has centred on Showa crater, to the East <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> of Minami-dake.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mountain}} has two summits, named Øystre Rasletind and Rasletind (Øystre meaning Eastern). The name probably {{derives from}} the Norwegian word for rumble [...] "rasle" [...] - <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> stones falling down. <b>The</b> south wall <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> is steep, so this makes the rumble-theory even more plausible. The name {{is also found in}} <b>the</b> tarn south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> and <b>the</b> smaller <b>summit</b> on <b>the</b> south end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plain south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> is called Raslet.|$|R

5|$|While the Soviet {{team was}} in Canada, Rick Noonan, a trainer for the University of British Columbia’s sports teams, was {{assigned}} by Hockey Canada {{to assist the}} Soviets. Noonan, who would be later be named general manager of Team Canada for the 1980 Winter Olympics, was the only Canadian to have regular access to the Soviet's locker room, and he was behind the Soviet's bench during the first four games <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Summit</b> Series.|$|E
5|$|Altar 19 {{was buried}} in the fill of the final version of Temple 33, {{immediately}} in front of the second version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> shrine. It was badly damaged and was broken into several pieces, and the majority of a sculpture depicting a seated person was chipped away. The three fragments were buried together in a way that paired the altar with the buried Stela 31; this may have maintained a relationship between the monuments that existed when they were originally on public display. The altar was crafted from limestone and is now in the site museum at Tikal. It has been dated to approximately AD 445.|$|E

5|$|As part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit,</b> {{the winners}} of the first Kavli Prizes were {{announced}} in a simulcast linking New York City and Oslo. The first Kavli Prize for astrophysics was awarded to Maarten Schmidt and Donald Lynden-Bell for their pioneering work on quasars. Louis E. Brus and Sumio Iijima shared the nanoscience prize for their contributions to the science of quantum dots and carbon nanotubes, respectively. Pasko Rakic, Thomas Jessell and Sten Grillner were awarded the neuroscience prize for their research into how neuronal networks develop and communicate.|$|E
5|$|Burial 7 was interred in a cist {{under the}} central {{chamber of the}} Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). Although {{it had already been}} looted when it was {{discovered}} by archaeologists, the prior collapse of the ceiling <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> shrine of the pyramid protected a section of the tomb from the looters. The remains were those of an adult male with an artificially deformed skull; he was laid out on his back with a north-south orientation with the head towards the north. The funerary offering included three polychrome ceramics; a tripod plate, a plate painted with the figure of a dancer and a vessel bearing the images of human figures and a jaguar. Burial 7 was immediately above the cist of Burial 9.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Summit</b> Series in 1972, {{a series of}} {{exhibition}} games between NHL and Soviet league clubs known as the Super Series was launched. On New Year's Eve 1975, the Canadiens met the Soviet Red Army {{in a game that}} is considered {{to be one of the}} greatest ever played. A contest between the two greatest hockey teams in the world, the match ended in a 3–3 draw following Soviet goaltender Vladislav Tretiak's 35-save performance.|$|E

5|$|On 22 December Hinkler, {{accompanied}} by John F. Leeming, {{president of the}} Lancashire Aero Club, made another attempt. The landing was no problem. On the steep slope and with a strong headwind the plane stopped quickly. Professor E. R. Dodds witnessed the landing. The uphill take-off was more difficult and the plane dived off the edge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> with insufficient airspeed, but picked up speed as it dived, narrowly missing Striding Edge, to return to Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Regular races were {{organised}} until 1903, {{when two}} events were held; {{these were the}} last for 24years, perhaps due to the closure <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> observatory the following year. The first was from Achintee, {{at the foot of}} the Pony Track, and finished at the summit; It was won in just over an hour by Ewen MacKenzie, the observatory roadman. The second race ran from new Fort William post office, and MacKenzie lowered the record to 2hours 10minutes, a record he held for 34years.|$|E
5|$|The 24th Infantry {{consistently}} captured Battle Mountain in {{the same}} way. Artillery, mortar, and tank fire raked the crest and air strikes employing napalm blanketed {{the top of the}} peak. Then, the infantry attacked from the hill beneath the east slope <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit.</b> Supporting mortars would set up a base of fire and kept the heights under barrage until the infantry had arrived at a point just short of the crest. The mortar fire then lifted and the infantry moved rapidly up the last stretch to the top, usually to find it abandoned by the North Koreans.|$|E

5|$|The Rhyd Ddu path, {{also called}} the Beddgelert Path, leads {{from the village of}} Rhyd Ddu, west of Snowdon, gently up on to Llechog, a broad ridge {{dropping}} west from the summit. It {{is considered one of the}} easier routes to the summit, with the advantage that the summit is visible from the start, but is one of the least used routes. It climbs at a shallow gradient to Bwlch Main, shortly southwest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit,</b> from where it climbs more steeply, meeting up with the Watkin Path at a site marked with a large standing stone a few hundred metres from the summit. An alternative start begins at Pitt's Head on the A4085 road.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} his father due to heart {{problems}} at the age of 49 had a lasting effect on Henderson. He was conscious of his own health, and survived a blockage in his own heart that was discovered in 2004. He was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2009. The disease prevented him from attending 40th anniversary celebrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Summit</b> Series in Moscow, but he was responding well to experimental treatment as part of a clinical trial he participated in into 2013.|$|E
5|$|The incline {{from there}} is not visible because of tree growth and it is {{difficult}} to get access to it without unreasonable encroachment on private property, although the OS map shows a public footpath crossing the incline about two-thirds of the way up. The remains of Brendon Hill station are Grade II listed. The remains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> winding house can be approached but are dangerous to enter: they are located just west of the junction of the B3224 and B3190 roads. A chapel built to attend to the spiritual needs of the miners and their families still stands at the junction.|$|E

5|$|The next {{successful}} ascent {{was made}} on January 29, 1834, 40years later, by the Scottish botanist David Douglas, who also reached the summit caldera using the ʻAinapō Trail. By the time Douglas reached the summit the environment had put him under extreme duress, but he nonetheless stayed overnight to make measurements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> caldera's proportions and record barometric data on its height, both now known to be widely inaccurate. Douglas collected biological samples on the way both up and down, and after a difficult and distressing descent began collating his samples; he planned to return to England, but instead several months later his body was mysteriously discovered crushed in a pit besides a dead wild boar.|$|E
5|$|The present period began about 150,000years ago and {{involved}} {{the development of}} the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. During the past 11,000years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them.|$|E
5|$|The {{summit and}} {{surrounding}} areas of Nethermost Pike contain many species and communities which are of biological interest. North east <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summit</b> is Nethermost Cove which contains some of England's best arctic-alpine and tall-herb vegetation, including {{one third of}} the English population of Downy Willow (Salix lapponum). Similarly Ruthwaite Cove contains Arctic-alpine and tall-herb communities, and it is believed that the cove may contain very rare species of plants in very small, and therefore precarious, populations. The lower eastern slopes form Grisedale Common, a large expanse of dwarf shrub heath. The lower slopes are grazed by sheep, which has a significant effect on the type of vegetation which grows. Certain areas, such as Eagle Crag, are inaccessible to sheep due to their steep slopes.|$|E
50|$|Like most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>summits</b> in <b>the</b> {{southern}} Carneddau, {{it has a}} flat, boulder-strewn summit plateau. Immediately to {{the north}} lie <b>the</b> crags <b>of</b> Ysgolion Duon, well-known to climbers.|$|R
