5|$|Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> were {{surprised}} that an episode about Homer's mother {{had not previously}} been produced. The writers used the episode {{as an opportunity to}} solve several puzzles about the show, such as where Lisa's intelligence came from.|$|E

5|$|Several {{years after}} {{studying}} experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, Hillenburg met Joe Murray, creator of Rocko's Modern Life, at an animation festival.

40|$|AUTHOR’S TEXT AS A RESOURCE FOR THE NATIONAL CORPUS AND THE WRITER’S LANGUAGE DICTIONARY Summary A {{dictionary}} of a writer’s {{language is}} a vocabulary that has been methodically collected, analyzed and commented upon and represents the language as used by a particular author. <b>The</b> existence <b>of</b> such dictionaries indicates <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific cultural environment, <b>the</b> stage <b>of</b> development <b>of</b> humanities and <b>the</b> capacity <b>of</b> computer resources. In <b>the</b> first stage <b>of</b> <b>the</b> project, <b>the</b> corpus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> language is created by collecting all <b>the</b> necessary texts <b>of</b> a selected author in a digital form. In the second stage, linguistic analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corpus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> language is carried out using the existing and improved technologies (software and software tools). And, finally, in the third stage, on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corpus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> language a dictionary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> language is created according to set thematic, philological and stylistic intentions. The analysis is carried out on three levels: computational linguistic, philological and cultural semiotic. The computerized environment provides a precise quantitative characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> vocabulary (part <b>of</b> speech, word use, collocations etc.). From <b>the</b> philological point <b>of</b> view, vocabulary is analyzed with <b>the</b> help <b>of</b> software tools that help identify and demonstrate <b>the</b> stylistic characterization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> language, namely, <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> vocabulary and word use (e. g. metaphors, synonyms, similes etc.). Another benefit of computerized analysis {{is related to the}} intention to acquire a more complete and comprehensive idea about specific features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writer’s</b> language style. </p...|$|R
5|$|The {{producers}} originally asked Anthony Hopkins and Clint Eastwood {{to provide}} {{the voice of the}} dentist, Dr. Wolfe, but they both turned the role down. Anthony Perkins was later asked to fulfill the role and he agreed, but died before the role could be recorded. In the end, the role went to Simpsons regular Hank Azaria. As well, the original panelist on Smartline was supposed to be O. J. Simpson, but he turned it down, much to the relief <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> when Simpson was later tried for murder.|$|E
5|$|The trial <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> Yuli Daniel and Andrei Sinyavsky in 1966 — {{the first}} such public trials since Stalin's day — marked the {{reversion}} to a repressive cultural policy. Under Yuri Andropov the state security service (in {{the form of the}} KGB) regained some of the powers it had enjoyed under Stalin, although there was no return to the purges of the 1930s and 1940s, and Stalin's legacy remained largely discredited among the Soviet intelligentsia.|$|E
5|$|The writing {{staff of}} Saturday Night Live and Henson's team did share some qualities; each group formed a {{separate}} social clique and were independently opinionated and creative.

Shortly afterwards, Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} {{speculation}} about possible successor shows, in May 2017 HBO commissioned five screenwriters – Max Borenstein, Jane Goldman, Brian Helgeland, Carly Wray and a fifth writer {{yet to be}} announced – to develop individual Game of Thrones successor series. All <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> are to be working individually with George R. R. Martin. Martin said that all the concepts under discussion are prequels, and some may be set outside Westeros. He also ruled out Robert's Rebellion (the overthrow of Daenerys's father by Robert Baratheon) as a possible idea. D. B. Weiss and David Benioff {{said that they would}} not be involved with any of the projects, and want to enjoy the successor series as fans. Martin is co-writing two of the four announced scripts. In September 2017, it was announced that Game of Thrones writer Bryan Cogman would be developing a fifth prequel series.|$|E
5|$|Benioff and Weiss {{sometimes}} assign {{characters to}} particular writers; for example, Cogman {{was assigned to}} Arya Stark for the fourth season. The writers spend several weeks writing a character outline, including what material from the novels to use and the overarching themes. After these individual outlines are complete, they spend another {{two to three weeks}} discussing each main character's individual arc and arranging them episode by episode. A detailed outline is created, with each <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> working on a portion to create a script for each episode. Cogman, who wrote two episodes for the fifth season, took {{a month and a half}} to complete both scripts. They are then read by Benioff and Weiss, who make notes, and parts of the script are rewritten. All ten episodes are written before filming begins, since they are filmed out of order with two units in different countries.|$|E

5|$|Credited with 19 episodes, Steve Callaghan is {{the most}} {{prolific}} writer on Family Guy staff. Many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> that have left the show {{have gone on to}} create or produce other successful series. Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan co-wrote 13 episodes for the NBC sitcom Scrubs during their eight-year run on the show, while also serving as co-producers and working their way up to executive producers. Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman left the show and went on to create the long-running and still ongoing adult animated series American Dad! MacFarlane is also a co-creator of American Dad! On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Barker had departed American Dad! during its run as well, after 10 seasons of serving as producer and co-showrunner over the series.|$|E
5|$|Drew Karpyshyn, who {{previously}} {{served as a}} senior writer for Knights of the Old Republic, was the lead writer for Mass Effect. Despite of the fact that each of the game's planets had one primary writer, all <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> involved in the production had to review each other's work and offer criticism. This process of collaborative feedback and individual effort is common at BioWare, and it behoved Karpyshyn to make sure the style was consistent across all different areas. One of the biggest challenges the writers faced was the amount of volume they were required to write to support the game's multiple dialogue paths and story outcomes. It took them three years to get everything into the game, which featured about 400,000 words and more than 20,000 lines of spoken dialogue. According to Karpyshyn, this is roughly the equivalent of 20 movies or 4-5 full novels.|$|E
5|$|Given {{its subject}} matter, the episode {{features}} many references to witchcraft and occultism. The nurse from the episode, Rebecca Waite, was originally {{named after a}} friend <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>writers</b> called Rebecca White. However, this was changed {{because there was a}} real nurse from Chicago whose last name was White. Some viewers ended up believing that Waite's name as a reference to either Rebecca Nurse, an innocent woman prosecuted during the Salem witch trials, or the Rider-Waite tarot deck, the most popular tarot deck utilized in the world. The episode itself directly references Gerald Gardner, a wiccan known for publishing several books on witchcraft and founder of the Gardnerian Tradition. While the Mayhew sisters tried to depict occultism without offending anybody by not connecting Franklin or Waite to any known cult, many Wiccans sent angry letters and e-mails to Fox regarding the portrayal of their beliefs.|$|E
