He began performing on city buses, often covering Mississippi John Hurt alongside original, sometimes improvisational compositions. [...] "I'd get <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>and</b> start playing Mississippi John Hurt with totally improvised lyrics. Some drunk would start yelling at me, calling me Axl Rose. So I'd start singing about Axl Rose and the levee and bus passes and strychnine, mixing the whole thing up," [...] he later recalled. He was also in a band called Youthless that hosted Dadaist-inspired freeform events at city coffee shops. [...] "We had Radio Shack mics and this homemade speaker and we'd draft {{people in the audience}} to recite comic books or do a beatbox thing, or we'd tie the whole audience up in masking tape," [...] Beck recalled.|$|E

The team cooled off {{the next day with}} a session in Sodertalje playing for the employees of a Volkswagen plant. The team played mock games against local teams of youngsters 12 and 13 years in age. The practice improved the mood of the players. The team drank beer <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus,</b> <b>and</b> started [...] "singing songs like a bunch of kids." [...] Several of the players then went out drinking, impressing Sinden the next day with their best practice session to date.

It too was a {{critical}} and commercial failure which, along with its two singles [...] "Stuck in a Loop" [...] and [...] "Post Post-Modern Man", hold {{the distinction of being}} Devo's worst-selling efforts; all failed to appear on the U.S. charts. Devo launched a concert tour in support of the album, but poor ticket sales and the bankruptcy and dissolution of Enigma Records, who was responsible for organizing and financing the tour, caused it to be cancelled part way through. They had a falling out and played one final show in March 1991 before breaking up. In an interview with Mark Mothersbaugh from excerpts on their 1996 computer game [...] "Devo Presents Adventures of the Smart Patrol, [...] "Around '88, '89, '90 maybe, we did our last tour in Europe, {{and it was kind of}} at that point, We were watching This Is Spinal Tap <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>and</b> said, 'Oh my God, that's our life.'

2500|$|The game {{ended with}} a final score of 79–10. North Texas's points came on a field goal {{in the third quarter}} and a 69-yard {{touchdown}} pass from quarterback Giovanni Vizza to Casey Fitzgerald {{at the beginning of the}} fourth quarter. The Mean Green finished with 15 yards rushing and 232 yards passing. All three of Oklahoma's quarterbacks saw gametime. Joey Halzle followed Bradford in the third quarter and completed four of his five pass attempts. Nichol finished the game, but did not attempt a pass. The Sooners had 668 yards of total offense against North Texas, the 11th-highest in school history to that point, and 403 passing yards, the fifth-highest in school history to that point. Oklahoma's 482 yards in the first half was the third highest for yardage in a half. Coach Stoops did admit being worried about running up the score. He said, [...] "Well, we were telling our guys not to score, if they broke free we were telling them to take a knee or something. Their style of play didn’t really help either. They got on the line and snapped the ball with 20 or so seconds left on the play clock. I’m not criticizing, I’m just saying that the style of play doesn’t help either.” Former Oklahoma coach Barry Switzer agreed: [...] "They had no game plan for losing… Because when you can't win a game, you need to run the clock, don't let it stop, don't throw passes incomplete… get the game over with, get <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>bus</b> <b>and</b> go home." [...] Stoops requested a running clock for the fourth quarter, but the request was not granted. North Texas's coach handled the loss well and held no ill-feelings towards to Sooners for the lopsided win. [...] "When you play a great team like that, you always have the chances of obviously this happening,” Dodge said. [...] "Give credit where credit is due – a great Oklahoma football team. Um ... Wow!
