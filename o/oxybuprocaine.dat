50|$|A topical {{anesthetic}} {{is a local}} anesthetic {{that is used to}} numb {{the surface}} of a body part. They can be used to numb any area of the skin as well as the front of the eyeball, the inside of the nose, ear or throat, the anus and the genital area. Topical anesthetics are available in creams, ointments, aerosols, sprays, lotions, and jellies. Examples include benzocaine, butamben, dibucaine, lidocaine, <b>oxybuprocaine,</b> pramoxine, proparacaine, proxymetacaine, and tetracaine (also named amethocaine).|$|E
50|$|Some {{patients}} {{who suffer from}} eye pain, which is often considerably strong neuropathic pain caused by the irritation of the nerves within the cornea and/or conjunctiva, unfortunately try to illegally obtain <b>oxybuprocaine</b> or other eye anesthetics (for example by stealing them at their ophthalmologist or optometrist, by forging medical prescriptions or by trying to order it via an online pharmacy) and secretly use the substance to numb their eye pain, often ending up with irreversible corneal damage or even destruction (which is a vicious cycle and causes even much more pain).

40|$|Anaesthetic eye drops for {{children}} in casualty departments across south east England It is a common practice to use topical anaesthetic drops to provide temporary relief and aid in {{the examination of the}} eyes when strong blepharospasm precludes thorough examination. Ophthalmology departments usually have several types of these—for example, amethocaine, <b>oxybuprocaine</b> (benoxinate), and proxymetacaine. The dura-tion and degree of discomfort caused by amethocaine is significantly higher than proxymetacaine, 1 2 whilst the difference in the discomfort between amethocaine and <b>oxybuprocaine</b> is minimal. 2 When dealing with children, therefore, it is recommended to use proxymetacaine drops. 1 It was my experience that Accident & Emergency (A&E) departments tend to have less choice of these drops. This survey was done to find out the availability of different anaesthetic drops, and the preference for paediatric use given a choice of the above three. Questionnaires were sent to 40 A&E departments across south east England. Thirty nine replied back, of which one department did not see any eye casualties. None of the 38 departments had proxymeta-caine. Twenty units had amethocaine alone and 10 units had <b>oxybuprocaine</b> alone. For paediatric use, these units were happy to use whatever drops were available within the unit. Eight units stocked amethocaine and <b>oxybuprocaine,</b> four of these were happy to use either of them on children and four used only <b>oxybuprocaine.</b> One of the latter pre-ferred proxymetacaine but had to contend with <b>oxybuprocaine</b> due to cost issues. Children are apprehensive about the instillation of any eye drops. Hence, it is desirable to use the least discomforting drops like proxymetacaine. For eye casualties, in majority of District General Hospitals, A&E departments are the first port of call. Hence, A&E units {{need to be aware of}} the benefit of proxymetacaine and stock them for paedia-tric use...|$|E

40|$|Background: No {{previous}} study in South Africa has used {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) in assessing corneal thickness changes following the instillation of an anaesthetic. Aim: The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the short-term effects of <b>oxybuprocaine</b> 0. 4 % on corneal thickness. Setting: The study was conducted at a university eye clinic in Westville, KwaZulu-Natal. Methods: A total of 34 (N = 34) participants, of both genders, aged 18 – 25 years participated in the study. Data collection commenced once ethical clearance was obtained. Baseline measurements of central corneal thickness (CCT) (within 0 mm – 2 mm of the corneal apex) and mid-peripheral corneal thickness (MPCT) (within 2 mm – 5 mm of the corneal apex) were taken using the Optovue iVue 100 OCT. Measurements were obtained using the standard iVue 100 corneal pachymetry map. One drop of <b>oxybuprocaine</b> was then instilled using a sterile technique in the right eye (RE) of each participant. Central and MPCT measurements were obtained using the OCT at time intervals of 30 s for the first 2 min and then for 60 -s intervals up until 5 min. Baseline central and MPCT were then measured for the left eye (LE) using the OCT. The effect of two drops of <b>oxybuprocaine</b> on CCT was also investigated on the left eye only using the same procedure as on the right eye. Results: There were minimal fluctuations of the CCT and MPCT in the 5 min following instillation of either one or two drops of <b>oxybuprocaine.</b> The fluctuation of both the CCT and MPCT was within 10 µm irrespective of dosage and returned to baseline thickness after 5 min. Conclusion: Clinically, short-term CCT and MPCT changes following the instillation of <b>oxybuprocaine</b> are not large enough to affect the accuracy of Goldmann applanation tonometry. </p...|$|E

This observational study was designed to investigate the effect of topical anesthesia on the parameters measured by the ocular response analyzer: corneal hysteresis, corneal resistance factor, Goldmann-correlated intraocular pressure (IOPg), and corneal-compensated intraocular pressure (IOPcc). Methods: Two sets of measurements were made for 78 eyes of 39 subjects, approximately 1 week apart. In session 1, each eye of each subject was randomized into one of three groups: polyvinyl alcohol (0. 5 %), tetracaine hydrochloride (0. 5 %), or <b>oxybuprocaine</b> hydrochloride (0. 4 %). In session 2, eyes that were in the polyvinyl alcohol group in session 1 were assigned to the tetracaine group, those in the tetracaine group in session 1 were assigned to <b>oxybuprocaine</b> group, and those in the <b>oxybuprocaine</b> group in session 1 were assigned to the polyvinyl alcohol group. For both sessions, each subject first had his or her central corneal thickness assessed with a specular microscope, followed by measurements of intraocular pressure and corneal biomechanical parameters with the Ocular Response Analyzer. All measurements were repeated for 2 minutes and 5 minutes following the instillation of either polyvinyl alcohol, tetracaine, or <b>oxybuprocaine.</b> The level of statistical significance was 0. 05. Results: Polyvinyl alcohol, tetracaine hydrochloride, and <b>oxybuprocaine</b> hydrochloride had no statistically significant (P &gt; 0. 05) effect on any of the biomechanical parameters of the cornea. There was no statistically significant effect on either IOPg (P &gt; 0. 05) or IOPcc (P &gt; 0. 05) 2 minutes after the eye drops were instilled in either session. Five minutes after the eye drops were instilled, polyvinyl alcohol showed no statistically significant effect on either IOPg (P &gt; 0. 05) or IOPcc (P &gt; 0. 05) in either session. <b>Oxybuprocaine</b> and tetracaine caused statistically significant (P &lt; 0. 05) reductions in IOPg in session 1, but only tetracaine had a significant (P &lt; 0. 05) effect in session 2. Tetracaine also caused a statistically significant (P &lt; 0. 05) reduction in IOPcc in session 1. Conclusion: The statistically significant effect of topical anesthesia on IOPg varies with the anesthetic used, and while this effect was statistically significant in this study, the small effect is probably not clinically relevant. There was no effect on any of the biomechanical parameters of the cornea.

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} {{outcomes}} such as postoperative nausea/vomiting, analgesic requirements, and hospital stay following {{the use of}} topical <b>oxybuprocaine</b> hydrochloride 0. 4 % or intravenous (IV) fentanyl in children undergoing strabismus surgery. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study. Children operated under general anesthesia for strabismus were given topical <b>oxybuprocaine</b> hydrochloride 0. 4 % (Group T) and IV fentanyl (Group F) before surgery. The episodes of nausea/vomiting, pain score, requirement of additional analgesia during postoperative period, and duration of hospital stay were compared in two groups. Results: There were 47 children in Group T and 59 children in Group F. The median pain score in two groups were 2. 38 (25 % quartile; 2. 0) and 3. 00 (25 % quartile; 3. 00), respectively. The difference was significant (K W P < 0. 03). The episodes of nausea/vomiting in two groups were in 2 and 6 children in Group T and Group F, respectively. The median hospital stay of children of Group T and Group F were 242 and 285 min, respectively. The difference {{was not statistically significant}} (P = 0. 22).

40|$|Background/Aims: Contact {{tonometry}} {{is generally}} considered more accurate than non-contact tonometry {{in the assessment of}} intraocular pressure (IOP). This study was designed to investigate the effect of ocular anesthesia, a pre-requisite for contact tonometry, on the IOP in a sample of visually normal subjects. Method: In a random sample of 120 young visually normal subjects (divided equally among three groups), the Topcon CT 80 non-contact tonometer was used to measure IOP before, at the second minute and at the fifth minute following instillation of one drop of one of three eyedrops – carboxymethylcellulose sodium 0. 5 % (control), <b>oxybuprocaine</b> hydrochloride 0. 4 % and proparacaine hydrochloride 0. 5 %. Results: The IOP measured before instilling the ophthalmic drops did not vary significantly among the three groups of subjects (p > 0. 05). In the control group, the average IOP of 15. 1 ± 2. 6 mmHg did not vary significantly (p > 0. 05) 2 minutes and 5 minutes following instillation of one drop of Carboxymethylcellulose sodium. There were statistically significant reductions of IOP 2 minutes (p 0. 01) and 5 minutes (p 0. 001) after the instillation of one drop of <b>oxybuprocaine</b> hydrochloride. One drop of proparacaine hydrochloride caused significant reductions in the average IOP after 2 minutes (p 0. 001) and after 5 minutes (p 0. 001). Conclusions: One drop of topical proparacaine or <b>oxybuprocaine</b> may cause a small but a statistically significant reduction in IOP which could lead to lower IOP readings...|$|E

An INADEQUATE two-dimensional experiment was used to link signals for the same independent molecule. The chemical shifts are discussed in relation to the crystal structure. Of the four ethyl groups attached to NH(+) nitrogens, one gives rise to unusually low chemical shifts, very different from those of the other three ethyl groups. This is attributed empirically to gamma-gauche conformational effects, as is confirmed by shielding computations. These considerations allow (13) C signals to be assigned to specific carbons in the two crystallographically inequivalent molecules in the crystal structure. Indeed, information about the conformations is inherent in the NMR spectrum, which thus provides data of crystallographic significance.

Materials and Methods : Prospective non-comparative evaluation of patients′ and surgeon′s satisfaction {{at the end of the}} procedure. Three hundred patients (300 eyes) were included in the study. The procedure was explained to patients with details regarding what will happen and what to expect during surgery. All patients received topical anesthesia with Benoxinate 0. 4 % eye drops and Xylocaine gel 2 %. All surgeries were done by the same surgeon using the same machine (updated LEGACY phacoemulsifier, Alcon) and approach (clear corneal incision) and followed by a foldable intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. Results : None of the patients had severe pain during the procedure; only 2 % (six of 300) required use of intravenous sedation (Propofol), both the surgeon′s and the patients′ satisfaction were high. Eye movements and blepharospasm were not significant problems, and no serious complications occurred. Rate of vitreous loss due to posterior capsule tear/rupture was within literature reported range and not different from our previous experience.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} instilling 13 commonly used preservatives on the murine cornea in vivo. Due to the instillation of preservatives, micro-lesions are formed on the cornea and can be selectively marked by fluorescein. The sum of the resulting fluorescent areas was measured using an episcopic microscope coupled to an image processing system. All the tested preservatives proved to be well-tolerated by the eye at commonly used concentrations. However, in some cases, increased concentrations of preservatives or combinations resulted in significant increase {{of the amount of}} corneal damage. With increasing the concentration, corneal lesion increased the most in the case of cetylpyridinium. While a combination of chlorobutanol 0. 5 % and phenylethylalcohol 0. 5 % did not result in an increase in corneal damage (when compared to the use of each separately), the associations of thiomersal 0. 02 % and phenylethylalcohol 0. 4 % on one hand and of edetate disodium (EDTA) 0. 1 % and benzalkonium 0. 01 % on the other, resulted in significant increases in the amount of corneal damage. However, in none of the tested combinations, the increase in the observed damage exceed the limit of ocular intolerance we had defined beforehand: thus, they were all deemed relatively well-tolerated.

Methods: Single-center randomized clinical trial. 40 eyes of 24 {{patients with}} treatment-naive proliferative diabetic retinopathy randomized to 20 ms-PRP and 100 ms-PRP under topical 0. 4 % <b>oxybuprocaine.</b> A masked grader used a pain questionnaire within one-hour (Numerical pain score: NPS) and one-month after treatment (Numerical headache score: NHS). Primary outcome measure was NPS immediately post-PRP. Secondary outcome measures were mean NHS scores {{and levels of}} photophobia reported within 4 -weeks of primary PRP. Results: Mean laser fluence was significantly lower using 20 ms-PRP (4. 8 J/cm 2) compared to 100 ms-PRP (11. 8 J/cm 2; p< 0. 001). Mean NPS scores for treatment were 2. 4 ± 2. 3 (mild) for 20 ms-PRP group compared to 4. 9 ± 3. 3 (moderate) in 100 ms-PRP group, a significant difference (95 %CI – 4. 3 to - 0. 68;p= 0. 006). Mean NHS score within 1 -month was 1. 5 ± 2. 7 in 20 ms-PRP group compared to 3. 2 ± 3. 5 in 100 ms-PRP group (p< 0. 05).

Aim {{of the study was}} to evaluate feasibility, protocol standardization and normal cytologic pattern of CIC in healthy horses. Methods Samples were taken from the bulbar conjunctiva of 25 healthy horses. The first 10 horses were used to standardize the method. CIC smears were collected following Bolzan???s protocol (4), after the instillation of <b>Oxybuprocaine</b> hydrochloride. Impressions were taken applying a 5 x 7 mm strip of Millipore filter with a pore size of 0. 45 µm (Merck Millipore, Milan) on the temporal bulbar conjunctiva and fixed in 95 % alcohol. Specimens were stained with Periodic Acid???Schiff (PAS) and with Hematoxilin???Eosin (H&E) stains. The Bolzan???s protocol was modified, reducing the time of immersion in Schiff???s reagent (3 min) and elongating the immersions in sodium metabisul???te (10 min). Stained samples were immersed in xylene and then mounted on slides cover-slipped. Conjunctival and inflammatory cells were differentiated with a light microscope, counting 200 cells for each eye, by scanning each sample in a sinuous and continuous pattern. Cellularity, cell distribution and damage were scored following the criteria of Bauer et al. (5). Results Cells??? count and quality scores were reported in table 1. A nose twitch was used in 5 cases. The technique allowed to collect a sufficient quantity of well-preserved cells. Goblet cells and erythrocytes were not observed. Epithelial and inflammatory cells, debris, naked nuclei and keratinized cells were found for both stains. Conclusions CIC can be considered a quite good technique for the study of the conjunctiva in the horse. Even if difficulties in the placement on the bulbar conjunctiva and the maintenance of the open eye were observed, the instillation of local anesthetic facilitate samples collection. CIC is non-invasive and well tolerated by the animal, as demonstrated by the absence of erythrocytes in the smears. It is important to assess the size of the strip, because smaller strips leaked from the biocassette. Samples had a good cellularity and cells were well distributed and preserved. The staining methods influenced the evaluation. PAS stain gave a strongly pink background, although the time of staining was reduced and the time of discoloration was elongated. The H&E stain gave less background and a better definition of morphologic cellular features and allowed the differentiation of inflammatory cells. Thus, H&E may be considered advisable when an inflammatory disease is suspected...|$|E
