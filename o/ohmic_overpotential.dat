The Butler-Volmer equation, Fick's model and Ohm's law {{were used to determine}} the activation, concentration and <b>ohmic</b> <b>overpotentials,</b> respectively. One important feature of this model is that both the exchange current density and gas diffusion coefficients were dependent on the cell microstructures (porosity and pore size) and operational parameters (temperature, pressure and gas composition). The simulation results were compared with experimental data from the literature, and good agreement was obtained. The subsequent parametric modeling analyses determined how individual overpotentials were related to the geometric and operational parameters. It was found that there existed optimal values of electrode pore size and porosity for maximum cell performance. Both the activation and <b>ohmic</b> <b>overpotentials</b> decreased significantly with increasing temperature. However, the concentration overpotential was found to increase with increasing temperature. This unexpected phenomenon was caused by the reduced gas density at elevated temperature despite the increase in diffusion coefficient with increasing temperature. Besides, increasing the hydrogen content in the fuel stream and increasing the operating pressure were possible ways to enhance the SOFC power output. The parametric analyses provided insights in the operation of SOFCs and clarified some ambiguous understanding of SOFC overpotentials.

The model was validated by comparing the simulation results with experimental data from the literature. Additional modelling analyses were conducted to gain better understanding of the SOFC working mechanisms at the micro-scale level and to quantify the performance of micro-structurally graded SOFC. It was found that micro-structural grading could significantly enhance the gas transport but had negligible effects on the <b>ohmic</b> and activation <b>overpotentials,</b> especially for thick electrodes. However, for thin electrodes with large particles, too much grading should be avoided as the increased activation overpotentials may result in higher overall overpotentials at a medium or low current density.

The difference between micro-structurally graded SOFC and conventional SOFC is more pronounced for smaller electrode-electrolyte (EE) interfacial particles. Particle size grading is generally more effective than porosity grading and it can increase the maximum power density by one-fold in comparison with conventional SOFC.

40|$|Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) is a {{promising}} technology for producing electricity cleanly and efficiently. This {{type of fuel}} cell is a high temperature fuel cell operating around 1000 °C for state-of-the-art SOFC. An advantage of the high temperature {{is the possibility of}} combined heat and power generation which would even further increase the efficiency of this technology. However, due to high operating temperatures, there are problems associated with the development and commercialization of SOFC, such as requirement of high temperature gas seals, and relatively poor long-term stability. The current trend in SOFC development is therefore to reduce the operating temperature of the cell to the range 600 - 800 °C. However, this requires developing new cell designs and materials since decreasing the operating temperature increases the <b>ohmic</b> <b>overpotential</b> due to higher ionic diffusion resistance in the electrolyte, thereby reducing electrochemical performance. For intermediate temperature SOFC, SDC is {{a promising}} electrolyte material to reduce the <b>ohmic</b> <b>overpotential.</b> The present research focused on developing a lD model of SDC based SOFC validated for a number of feed gas compositions, from humidified H 2, mixture of CO and C 02, to several syngas compositions (typical of diesel syngas, biomass syngas and pre-reformed natural gas). The model was developed for an anode supported cell. Few parameters were used as free fit parameters: essentially structural parameters, such as porosity and tortuosity, as well as kinetic parameters for H 1 and CO electrochemical reactions. In most cases, the simulated results (polarization curve) fitted well the experimental data. It was seen that the performance of CO/C 02 system is considerably lower than the H 2 /H 20 system. The model results also allowed to access variables' profiles that would not be accessible experimentally, such species composition profile and local current density along the anode. In particular, it was observed that most the electrochemical reaction occurred within 10 μm away from the anode/ electro I yte interface. In the literature, the water-gas shift (WGS) reaction is considered to occur only over Ni, but the present work demonstrated that SDC is active toward the WGS reaction. Therefore, a kinetic study was carried out to determine a rate expression for the WGS reaction. This rate expression was then incorporated into the SOFC model. The results indicated that inclusion of the WGS reaction on SDC has minor or negligible effect in most situations, except in the case of CO mole fraction for the diesel syngas feed at higher cell voltage. The reason was that the composition of diesel syngas was such that there was a higher driving force for the WGS reaction to proceed in the reverse WGS direction. When the water content is high enough, {{as in the case of}} higher current densities, the form of the derived rate expression for the WGS on SDC makes the value of this rate very small.

The calculation results based on the electrochemistry impedance spectroscopy test results revealed that the striking increase of the electrolysis voltage was mainly attributed to the <b>ohmic</b> <b>overpotential,</b> which was due to the replacement of H+ by Fe 3 + in the Nafion resin. Interestingly, the voltage lagged behind the current for several minutes in the multi-current- step test for the contaminated electrolyser, which phenomenon may be used for judging whether the SPE water electrolyser performance degradation is due to the metal ions contamination. Furthermore, recovery strategy has been developed, and {{it was found that the}} contaminated electrolyser could be mostly recovered by 0. 5 M H 2 SO 4 solution treatment for 13 h.

40|$|The {{instantaneous}} {{efficiency of}} an operating photoelectrochemical solar-fuel-generator {{system is a}} complicated function of the tradeoffs between the light intensity and temperature-dependence of the photovoltage and photocurrent, {{as well as the}} losses associated with factors that include <b>ohmic</b> resistances, concentration <b>overpotentials,</b> kinetic overpotentials, and mass transport. These tradeoffs were evaluated quantitatively using an advanced photoelectrochemical device model comprised of an analytical device physics model for the semiconducting light absorbers in combination with a multi-physics device model that solved for the governing conservation equations in the various other parts of the system. The model was used to evaluate the variation in system efficiency due to hourly and seasonal variations in solar irradiation as well as due to variation in the isothermal system temperature. The system performance characteristics were also evaluated {{as a function of the}} band gaps of the dual-absorber tandem component and its properties, as well as the device dimensions and the electrolyte conductivity. The modeling indicated that the system efficiency varied significantly during the day and over a year, exhibiting local minima at midday and a global minimum at midyear when the solar irradiation is most intense. These variations can be reduced by a favorable choice of the system dimensions, by a reduction in the electrolyte ohmic resistances, and/or by utilization of very active electrocatalysts for the fuel-producing reactions. An increase in the system temperature decreased the annual average efficiency and led to less rapid ramp-up and ramp-down phases of the system, but reduced midday and midyear instantaneous efficiency variations. Careful choice of the system dimensions resulted in minimal change in the system efficiency in response to degradation in the quality of the light absorbing materials. The daily and annually averaged mass of hydrogen production for the optimized integrated system compared favorably to the daily and annually averaged mass of hydrogen that was produced by an optimized stand-alone tandem photovoltaic array connected electrically to a stand-alone electrolyzer system. The model can be used to predict the performance of the system, to optimize the design of solar-driven water splitting devices, and to guide the development of components of the devices as well as of the system as a whole...|$|R
40|$|Today, the {{electricity}} industries are facing new challenges {{as the market}} is being liberalized and deregulated in many countries. Electricity storage is undoubtedly a disruptive technology that will play, in the near future, {{a major role in}} the fast developing distributed generations network. Indeed, electricity storage has many potential applications: management of the supply and demand of electricity, power quality, integration of renewable sources, improvement of the level of use of the transport and distribution network, etc. Over the years, many storage technologies have been investigated and developed, some have reached the demonstrator level and only a few have become commercially available. The pumped hydro facilities have been successfully storing electricity for more than a century; but today, appropriate locations are seldom found. Electrochemical storage is also an effective means to accumulate electrical energy; among the emerging technologies, the flow batteries are excellent candidates for large stationary storage applications where the vanadium redox flow battery (VRB) distinguishes itself thanks to its competitive cost and simplicity. In this ambitious work that encompasses the domains of electricity, electrochemistry and fluid mechanics, we have proposed a novel multiphysics model of the VRB. This model describes the principles and relations that govern the behaviour of the VRB under any set of operating conditions. Furthermore, this multiphysics model is a powerful means to identify and quantify the sources of losses within the VRB storage system; indeed, one of the purposes of this study is to propose strategies of control and operation for a greater effectiveness of the overall storage system. The electrochemical model is based on the electrochemical principles and the study of the VRB chemistry; this model determines the equilibrium voltage from the vanadium concentrations, and the associated activation, concentration, <b>ohmic</b> and ionic <b>overpotentials.</b> Furthermore, the vanadium concentrations within the tank and the stack are constantly determined as a function of the current and the electrolyte flowrate. A simplified model of the internal loss is also proposed. The electrochemical performance was then established through the simulation of a stand alone system composed of a solar source, a VRB and a load. The model determines the stack voltage, the power flows and the vanadium concentrations over a 24 h period. Furthermore, the model was successfully compared with experimental data through a series of charge and discharge cycles at constant currents. Thereafter, the properties of the electrolyte are briefly investigated: in particular their dependence upon the electrolyte composition. Indeed, the viscosity and the density are important parameters of the mechanical model. In order to analyse the battery performance, a mechanical model has been proposed to determine the mechanical power required to flow the electrolytes. This model based on fluid mechanics has an analytical part that predicts the pressure drop within the pipes and the tanks, and a numerical part. Indeed, the stack geometry is so complex that it can not be described analytically; therefore, a numerical model based on finite element method (FEM) is proposed. Hence, the mechanical power necessary to the battery operation is obtained at any operating conditions. The electrochemical and the mechanical models are finally assembled to form the original multiphysics model of the VRB. This model provides a good insight of the battery operation and offers a powerful means to enhance the battery performance. Indeed, there is at constant current an optimal flowrate that maximizes the efficiency. A second series of charge and discharge cycles has determined the efficiency of different control strategies. Finally, the battery operations at constant power were also discussed in details and an optimal operating point has been highlighted...|$|R
40|$|An {{electrochemical}} {{model was}} developed to study the NH 3 -fed and H 2 -fed solid oxide fuel cells based on proton conducting electrolyte (SOFC-H). The modeling results were consistent with experimental data in literature. It is found {{that there is little}} difference in working voltage and power density between the NH 3 -fed and the H 2 -fed SOFC-H with an electrolyte-support configuration due to an extremely high <b>ohmic</b> <b>overpotential</b> in the SOFC-H. With an anode-supported configuration, especially when a thin film electrolyte is used, the H 2 -fed SOFC-H shows significantly higher voltage and power density than the NH 3 -fed SOFC-H due to the significant difference in concentration overpotentials. The anode concentration overpotential of the NH 3 -fed SOFC-H is found much higher than the H 2 -fed SOFC-H, as the presence of N 2 gas dilutes the H 2 concentration and slows down the transport of H 2. More importantly, the cathode concentration overpotential is found very significant despite of the thin cathode used in the anode-supported configuration. In the SOFC-H, H 2 O is produced in the cathode, which enables complete fuel utilization on one hand, but dilutes the concentration of O 2 and impedes the diffusion of O 2 to the reaction sites on the other hand. Thus, the cathode concentration overpotential is the limiting factor for the H 2 -fed SOFC-H and an important voltage loss in the NH 3 -fed SOFC-H. How to reduce the concentration overpotentials at both electrodes is identified crucial to develop high performance SOFC-H. © 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of a charge-transfer reaction at a porous gas-diffusion electrode {{are presented}} using the simple pore model. The rate of diffusion of the reactant gas through the electrolyte-free {{part of the}} pore is sufficiently fast for pore radii of 10 - 4 cm or higher. The dissolution of gas at the gas-electrolyte interface causes no limitations. For the processes occurring in the electrolyte occupied part of the pore, all forms of polarization {{are taken into account}} and expressions are derived for the current distribution and overpotential-current-density relations. By using numerical values of the various parameters (diffusion coefficient, solubility of reactant gas in electrolyte, specific conductance of electrolyte), it is shown that the case of all forms of polarization reduces to one of activation and concentration overpotential. A one-dimensional treatment is valid up to about 25 % of the limiting current for this case. The dependence of current-distribution and overpotential-current-density relations on the various kinetic parameters is shown graphically for these cases. It is shown that most of the current (over 90 %) is generated over {{a small fraction of the}} pore length (10 - 2 - 10 - 4) in the practical overpotential range (i. e. for reasonable current densities) when all forms of polarization are taken into account. The case of activation and <b>ohmic</b> <b>overpotential</b> shows the interesting result that current densities can be increased by a factor of up to 10 3 times if concentration overpotential is eliminated, as for example by using very soluble fuels or by circulating the electrolyte saturated with reactant through the porous electrode.

40|$|To {{decrease}} {{the consumption of}} fossil fuels, {{research has been done}} on utilizing low grade heat, sourced from industrial waste streams. One promising thermoenergy conversion system is a thermogalvanic cell; it consists of two identical electrodes held at different temperatures that are placed in contact with a redox-based electrolyte [1, 2]. The temperature dependence of the direction of redox reactions allows power to be extracted from the cell [3, 4]. This study aims to increase the power conversion efficiency and reduce the cost of thermogalvanic cells by optimizing the electrolyte and utilizing a carbon based electromaterial, reduced graphene oxide, as electrodes. Thermal conductivity measurements of the K 3 Fe(CN) 6 /K 4 Fe(CN) 6 solutions used, indicate that the thermal conductivity decreases from 0. 591 to 0. 547 W/m K as the concentration is increased from 0. 1 to 0. 4 M. The lower thermal conductivity allowed a larger temperature gradient to be maintained in the cell. Increasing the electrolyte concentration also resulted in higher power densities, brought about by a decrease in the <b>ohmic</b> <b>overpotential</b> of the cell, which allowed higher values of short circuit current to be generated. The concentration of 0. 4 M K 3 Fe(CN) 6 /K 4 Fe(CN) 6 is optimal for thermal harvesting applications using R-GO electrodes due to the synergistic effect of the reduction in thermal flux across the cell and the enhancement of power output, on the overall power conversion efficiency. The maximum mass power density obtained using R-GO electrodes was 25. 51 W/kg (three orders of magnitude higher than platinum) at a temperature difference of 60 °C and a K 3 Fe(CN) 6 /K 4 Fe(CN) 6 concentration of 0. 4 M...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on aqueous thermogalvanic cells has been reviewed. Wherever possible, the power conversion efficiency, +r, relative {{to that of}} a Carnot engine operating between the same temperatures and the figure of merit, Z, of the cell have been extracted from the literature data in order to assess the cell's possible use for solar energy conversion. The determina-tion of qSr and Z in such a cell requires the temperature dependence of its open-circuit potential difference and the knowledge of the current delivery characteristics of the cell. The current delivery characteristics depend on the effects of activation overpotential, <b>ohmic</b> <b>overpotential,</b> nd mass transport overpotential on the cell's current. The determination f the cell performance is hindered because a number of researchers apply an external potential to their cells or use forced electrolyte stirring, both of which introduce unknown amounts of energy into the energy balance for the cell. The best performance found for an aqueous thermogalvanic cell which does not have such external energy inputs, is (~r = 0. 50 % and Z = 0. 58 • 10 - 4 K 1. Estimates of the maximum ~ = likely to be obtained from an aqueous thermogalvanie c ll suggest that {{it would be difficult to}} obtain values in excess of qbr = 1. 2 %, which corresponds to Z = 1. 5 • 10 - 4 K- 1. These values are somewhat lower than the typical values for metal and semiconductor thermocouples. The main cause of the low efficiencies of aqueous thermogalvanic cells is the presence of high concentrations of water molecules which conduct heat from the hot to the cold electrode but which are not themselves charge carriers. It is shown that the replacement of aqueous electrolytes by molten salts would not provide a sufficiently large increase in qbr to justify the very high temperatures required for such systems...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} work, a model-based {{parametric}} {{analysis of the}} performance of a direct ethanol polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (DE-PEMFC) is conducted with the purpose to investigate the effect of several parameters on the cell's operation. The analysis is based on a previously validated one-dimensional mathematical model that describes the operation of a DE-PEMFC in steady state. More precisely, the effect of several operational and structural parameters on (i) the ethanol crossover rate from the anode to the cathode side of the cell, (ii) the parasitic current generation (mixed potential formation) and (iii) the total cell performance is investigated. According to the model predictions {{it was found that the}} increase of the ethanol feed concentration leads to higher ethanol crossover rates, higher parasitic currents and higher mixed potential values resulting in the decrease of the cell's power density. However there is an optimum ethanol feed concentration (approximately 1. 0 mol L(- 1)) for which the cell power density reaches its highest value. The platinum (Pt) loading of the anode and the cathode catalytic layers affects strongly the cell performance. Higher values of Pt loading of the catalytic layers increase the specific reaction surface area resulting in higher cell power densities. An increase of the anode catalyst loading compared to an equal one of the cathode catalyst loading has greater impact on the cell's power density. Another interesting finding is that increasing the diffusion layers' porosity up to a certain extent, improves the cell power density despite the fact that the parasitic current increases. This is explained by the fact that the reactants' concentrations over the catalysts are increased, leading to lower activation overpotential values, which are the main source of the total cell overpotentials. Moreover, the use of a thicker membrane leads to lower ethanol crossover rate, lower parasitic current and lower mixed potential values in comparison to the use of a thinner one. Finally, according to the model predictions when the cell operates at low current densities the use of a thick membrane is necessary to reduce the negative effect of the ethanol crossover. However, in the case where the cell operates at higher current densities (lower ethanol crossover rates) a thinner membrane reduces the <b>ohmic</b> <b>overpotential</b> leading to higher power density values.

40|$|The Li-O 2 {{battery is}} a {{promising}} {{electrochemical energy storage}} platform for transportation applications due to its high theoretical specific energy of 3260 W h kg[-] 1. However, several problems must be solved {{before it can be}} developed commercially. We identify the Li-O 2 cell's most pertinent problems as those that are the direct result of the discharge product, Li 2 O 2. In particular, Li 2 O 2 deposits as an electrically insulating solid in the cathode, which can limit the transport of oxygen and electrons, both of which are essential for the cell's operation. By using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we find that oxygen transport limitations are insignificant compared to electron transport limitations. Furthermore, electron transport limitations are manifested in a complex manner, as demonstrated through a model in which Li 2 O 2 nucleate and grow as discrete particles on the cathode surface. The potential drop at the end of discharge coincides with the complete coverage of the cathode surface, indicating that the overpotential gained during discharge is the kinetic overpotential of the oxygen reduction reaction rather than an <b>ohmic</b> <b>overpotential</b> through the Li 2 O 2 bulk. Increasing the current density is shown to decrease the capacity by increasing the nucleation rate, leading to faster crowding of the cathode surface. An improved understanding of Li 2 O 2 formation can instruct effective strategies for improving the capacity and rechargeability of the Li-O 2 cell. Methods to improve capacity are proposed based on the general strategy of reducing the nucleation rate. With a molecular dynamics simulation, we show that solvents that coordinate with Li+, such as tetraglyme, can form a steric barrier against the deposition of O 2 -, the precursor to Li 2 O 2. An open-structure cathode material, vapor grown carbon fiber (VGCF), is demonstrated to exhibit a high discharge capacity despite its low surface area, as indicated by the formation of Li 2 O 2 particles up to 4 [mu]m in diameter. By coupling a diffusion model to the Li 2 O 2 nucleation and growth model, we show that VGCF can provide access to a greater volume of electrolyte for LiO 2 to diffuse in, which effectively reduces the rate of nucleation by reducing {{the rate at which the}} nucleating species accumulates near the surface. The formation of Li 2 O 2 particles also provides clues to the origins of capacity fade during cycling. Large Li 2 O 2 particles can electronically isolate carbon particles from the cathode, thus reducing their surface area. We use electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to show that the effective capacitance of the cathode, which is proportional to its surface area, decreases as a function of the number of cycles passed. VGCF is able to resist electronic isolation, achieving both a stable reversible capacity of 630 mAh g[-] 1 and a stable capacitance value after 35 cycles. To address the rechargeability of Li 2 O 2 particles that are larger than the electron transport length, we study the use of soluble redox mediators. Preliminary experiments show that the depletion of redox activity over time is a challenge that must be overcome to make redox mediators work in a practical Li-O 2 cell...|$|E
40|$|Solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) are {{solid-state}} ceramic cells, typically operating between 1073 K and 1273 K. Because of high operating temperature, SOFCs are mostly applicable in stationary power generation. Among various configurations in which SOFCs exist, the planar configuration of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) {{has the potential}} to offer high power density due to shorter current path. Moreover, the planar configuration of SOFC is simple to stack and closely resemble the stacking arrangement of polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells. However, due to high operating temperature, there are problems associated with the development and commercialization of planar SOFCs, such as requirement of high temperature gas seals, internal stresses in cell components, and high material and manufacturing costs. Mathematical modeling is an essential tool for the advancement of SOFC technology. Mathematical models can help in gaining insights on the processes occurring inside the fuel cell, and can also aid in the design and optimization of fuel cells by examining the effect of various operating and design conditions on performance. A multi-component and multi-dimensional mathematical model of SOFCs has been developed in this thesis research. One of the novelties of the present model is its treatment of electrodes. An electrode in the present model is treated as two distinct layers referred to as the backing layer and the reaction zone layer. Reaction zone layers are thin layers {{in the vicinity of the}} electrolyte layer where electrochemical reactions occur to produce oxide ions, electrons and water vapor. The other important feature of the present model is its flexibility in fuel choice, which implies not only pure hydrogen but also any reformate composition can be used as a fuel. The modified Stefan-Maxwell equations incorporating Knudsen diffusion are used to model multi-component diffusion in the porous backing and reaction zone layers. The coupled governing equations of species, charge and energy along with the constitutive equations in different layers of the cell are solved for numerical solution using the finite volume method and developed code written in the computer language of C++. In addition, the developed numerical model is validated with various experimental data sets published in the open literature. Moreover, it is verified that the electrode in an SOFC can be treated as two distinct layers referred to as the backing layer and the reaction zone layer. The numerical model not only predicts SOFC performance at different operating and design conditions but also provides insight on the phenomena occurring within the fuel cell. In an anode-supported SOFC, the <b>ohmic</b> <b>overpotential</b> is the single largest contributor to the cell potential loss. Also, the cathode and electrolyte overpotentials are not negligible even though their thicknesses are negligible relative to the anode thickness. Moreover, methane reforming and water-gas shift reactions aid in significantly reducing the anode concentration overpotential in the thick anode of an anode-supported SOFC. A worthwhile comparison of performance between anode-supported and self-supported SOFCs reveals that anode-supported design of SOFCs is the potential design for operating at reduced temperatures. A parametric study has also been carried out to investigate the effect of various key operating and design parameters on the performance of an anode-supported SOFC. Reducing the operating temperature below 1073 K results in a significant drop in the performance of an anode-supported SOFC; hence ionic conductivity of the ion-conducting particles in the reaction zone layers and electrolyte needs to be enhanced to operate anode-supported SOFCs below 1073 K. Further, increasing the anode reaction zone layer beyond certain thickness has no significant effect on the performance of an anode-supported SOFC. Moreover, there is a spatial limitation to the transport of oxide ions in the reaction zone layer, thereby reflecting the influence of reaction zone thickness on cell performance...|$|E
