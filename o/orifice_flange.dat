40|$|Structural {{failure of}} a high {{pressure}} <b>orifice</b> <b>flange</b> of an oil refinery is studied by using visual inspection, optical and electron microscopy, tensile tests, fractography and stress calculation. This flange was located at a high pressure (2700 KPa), elevated temperature (370 CÂ°) feeding pipe line. Failure observed during a startup {{at the time of}} increasing pressure and temperature. The results of the analysis show that brittle fracture has acted as a main factor for failure of the structure and stress concentration together with corrosion have provided minor sources for the failure. These results indicate that brittle behavior of this flange can attribute to hydrogen embrittlement of the steel material...|$|E

Coverage {{is limited to}} the following: (a) welding neck flanges Classes 300, 400, 600, 900, 1500, and 2500 (b) slip-on and threaded Class 300.|$|R

5000|$|Rosette {{and lower}} {{pitchers}} are only produced {{for a short}} time before the plant transitions into a scrambling vine (although they may be produced later on offshoots from the original stem). They grow up to 18 cm high by 5 wide. They are ovate in the basal fifth to half of the pitcher cup, being bulbous to varying degrees in this portion, often narrowly so. The pitcher is narrower in the upper part and may be cylindrical or slightly [...] towards the orifice. The boundary between these two portions is often delineated by a pronounced hip. The ventral face of the pitcher is flattened. A pair of wings up to 16 mm wide runs down the ventral surface of the pitcher cup. These wings bear densely packed [...] fringe elements up to 19 mm long, which commonly exceed the width of the wings themselves. These filaments are often arranged in pairs, spaced around 2 mm apart, and are usually branched [...] once or twice. The waxy zone of the inner surface is well developed.The pitcher mouth is often distinctly rhomboid in shape, but may also be oval or elliptic. It has a highly oblique insertion and is concave when viewed in profile. The mouth rises at the rear to form a tapered neck, which may be held upright or be inclined forward over the pitcher orifice. The species is noted for having possibly the most developed peristome in the genus. It is cylindrical to slightly flattened, glossy, rigid, and up to 5 mm wide (excluding the teeth). It consists of expanded ribs up to 6 mm high and spaced up to 5 mm apart. The entire flanges can measure up to 15 mm in length, although their size and number differ between populations (a typical number being approximately 20 {{on each side of the}} <b>orifice).</b> These <b>flanges</b> form exceptionally long, incurved teeth at the inner edge of the pitcher orifice. The teeth are sickle-shaped (...) and extend approximately 7 mm into the interior, as measured from the inner edge of the peristome to the tooth apex. The outer edge of the peristome is , with the recurved flanges extending for around 2 mm past the rim. The teeth of the neck may assume a dagger-like shape and measure up to 10 mm by 2 mm. These uppermost teeth are often noticeably splayed forward.|$|R
