40|$|Extreme solar {{activity}} fluctuations and {{the occurrence of}} solar grand minima and maxima episodes, are well established, observed features of the solar cycle. Nevertheless, such extreme activity fluctuations and {{the dynamics of the}} solar cycle during Maunder minima-like episodes remain ill-understood. We explore the origin of such extreme {{solar activity}} fluctuations and the role of dual poloidal field sources, namely the Babcock-Leighton mechanism and the mean-field alpha effect in the dynamics of the solar cycle. We mainly concentrate on entry and recovery from grand minima episodes such as the Maunder minimum and the dynamics of the solar cycle. We use a kinematic solar dynamo model with a novel set-up in which stochastic perturbations force two distinct poloidal field alpha effects. We explore different regimes of operation of these poloidal sources with distinct <b>operating</b> <b>thresholds,</b> to identify the importance of each. The perturbations are implemented independently in both hemispheres which allows one to study the level of hemispheric coupling and hemispheric asymmetry in the emergence of sunspots. From the simulations performed we identify a few different ways in which the dynamo can enter a grand minima episode. While fluctuations in any of the α effects can trigger intermittency we find that the mean-field alpha effect is crucial for the recovery of the solar cycle from a grand minima episode which a Babcock-Leighton source alone, fails to achieve. Our simulations also demonstrate other cycle dynamics. We conclude that stochastic fluctuations in two interacting poloidal field sources working with distinct <b>operating</b> <b>thresholds</b> is a viable candidate for triggering episodes of extreme solar activity and that the mean-field alpha effect capable of working on weak, sub-equipartition fields is critical to the recovery of the solar cycle following an extended solar minimum.

40|$|Results on {{the effects}} of digital {{accumulators}} in phase and frequency tracking loops are presented. Digital accumulators or summers are used extensively in digital signal processing to perform averaging or to reduce processing rates to acceptable levels. For tracking the Doppler of high-dynamic targets at low carrier-to-noise ratios, it is shown through simulation and experiment that digital accumulators can contribute an additional loss in <b>operating</b> <b>threshold.</b> This loss was not considered in any previous study and needs to be accounted for in performance prediction analysis. Simulation and measurement results are used to characterize the loss due to the digital summers for three different tracking loops: a digital phase-locked loop, a cross-product automatic frequency tracking loop, and an extended Kalman filter. The tracking algorithms are compared with respect to their frequency error performance and their ability to maintain lock during severe maneuvers at various carrier-to-noise ratios. It is shown that failure to account for the effect of accumulators can result in an inaccurate performance prediction, the extent of which depends highly on the algorithm used...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Static {{random access}} memory (SRAM) is the most {{commonly}} employed semiconductor {{in the design of}} on-chip processor memory. However, {{it is unlikely that the}} SRAM technology will have a cell size that will continue to scale below 45 nm, due to the leakage current that is caused by the quantum tunneling effect. Magnetic {{random access memory}} (MRAM) is a candidate technology to replace SRAM, assuming appropriate dimensioning given an <b>operating</b> <b>threshold</b> voltage. The write current of spin transfer torque (STT) -MRAM is a known limitation; however, this has been recently mitigated by leveraging perpendicular magnetic tunneling junctions. In this article, we present a comprehensive comparison of spin transfer torque-MRAM (STT-MRAM) and SRAM cache set banks. The non-volatility of STT-MRAM allows the definition of new instant on/off policies and leakage current optimizations. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that STT-MRAM is a candidate for the memory hierarchy of embedded systems, due to the higher densities and reduced leakage of MRAM. We demonstrate that adopting STT-MRAM in L 1 and L 2 caches mitigates the impact of higher write latencies and increased current draw due to the use of MRAM. With the correct system-on-chip (SoC) design, we believe that STT-MRAM is...|$|E
