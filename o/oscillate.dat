5|$|A shell {{galaxy is}} a type of {{elliptical}} galaxy where the stars in the galaxy's halo are arranged in concentric shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been observed in spiral galaxies. The shell-like structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a smaller companion galaxy. As the two galaxy centers approach, the centers start to <b>oscillate</b> around a center point, the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar to ripples spreading on water.

5|$|Planet Nine modifies {{the orbits}} of extreme trans-Neptunian objects via a {{combination}} of secular and resonant dynamics. The secular dynamics acts on very long timescales and causes {{the distance of the}} perihelia of anti-aligned objects to rise and fall while the directions of their perihelia <b>oscillate.</b> The resonant dynamics acts on shorter timescales and provides phase protection, maintaining the stability of the objects by preventing close approaches. The inclination of Planet Nine's orbit weakens this protection, resulting in a chaotic variation of semi-major axes as objects hop between resonances. The orbital poles of the objects circle that of the Solar System's Laplace plane, which is bent toward the plane of Planet Nine's orbit, causing their poles to be clustered toward one side.|$|E

5|$|The {{oldest and}} most precise method of X-ray {{crystallography}} is single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered beams. When they land {{on a piece of}} film or other detector, these beams make a diffraction pattern of spots; the strengths and angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each spot is called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and to within a few tenths of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but <b>oscillate</b> about their mean positions, usually by less than a few tenths of an angstrom. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations.|$|E

5|$|The secular {{effects of}} a distant massive planet alters this behavior, causing the longitudes of {{perihelion}} of anti-aligned objects to librate, or <b>oscillate</b> within a limited range of values, while their perihelia rise and fall. As the angle between an anti-aligned object's perihelion and Planet Nine's (delta longitude of perihelion on diagram) climbs beyond 180° Planet Nine exerts an increasingly positive torque on the object. This torque increases the object's angular momentum, causing the eccentricity of its orbit to decline (see blue curves on diagram) and its perihelion to rise away from Neptune's orbit. While the object's eccentricity is declining its precession rate is slowing. Once the object's precession rate becomes slower than that of Planet Nine delta longitude of perihelion begins to descend. After delta longitude of perihelion drops below 180° the object begins to feel an increasingly negative torque. This causes the object's angular momentum to decrease, and its eccentricity grows and perihelion falls. When the object's eccentricity is again large, its precession rate increases, causing delta longitude of perihelion to climb toward 180°, returning the object to its original orbit.|$|E
5|$|The slight {{eccentricity}} of Europa's orbit, {{maintained by}} the gravitational disturbances from the other Galileans, causes Europa's sub-Jovian point to <b>oscillate</b> around a mean position. As Europa comes slightly nearer to Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational attraction increases, causing Europa to elongate {{towards and away from}} it. As Europa moves slightly away from Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational force decreases, causing Europa to relax back into a more spherical shape, and creating tides in its ocean. The orbital eccentricity of Europa is continuously pumped by its mean-motion resonance with Io. Thus, the tidal flexing kneads Europa's interior and gives it a source of heat, possibly allowing its ocean to stay liquid while driving subsurface geological processes. The ultimate source of this energy is Jupiter's rotation, which is tapped by Io through the tides it raises on Jupiter and is transferred to Europa and Ganymede by the orbital resonance.|$|E
5|$|On April17, the {{tropical}} cyclone began to track slightly southwestward and encountered {{an area of}} dry air and enhanced wind shear, thus temporarily weakening Kujira. Despite the prolonged effects from these inhibitors, the typhoon restrengthened to a secondary peak intensity the following day. Though the JTWC indicated {{a significant increase in}} maximum sustained winds, the intensification was only reflected by the JMA with a slight drop in barometric pressure. Over the next two days Kujira would begin to track more northward due to a weakness in the nearby subtropical ridge and <b>oscillate</b> in strength due to an eyewall replacement cycle; a tertiary peak in strength occurred on April20 before subsequent weakening. This trend continued, and at 1800UTC on April21, both the JMA and JTWC downgraded Kujira to tropical storm status. Following the system's downgrade, Kujira became quasi-stationary due to the presence of two nearby high pressure areas, and its motion became erratic. Despite hostile atmospheric conditions, {{the tropical}} storm remained intact with persistent, deep convection and organized rainbands. Late on April23, however, the cyclone began to drift towards the north as it made its closest approach to Taiwan. Throughout the following day, Kujira would continue to accelerate towards the northeast and weaken at the same time. At 1200UTC on April24, PAGASA ceased issuing advisories on the storm as it had exited the agency's area of responsibility. At 0300UTC the next day, the JMA downgraded the storm to tropical depression intensity while the JTWC ceased monitoring of the system three hours later. At roughly the same time, Kujira made landfall near Ushibuka, Kumamoto at the same intensity. Weakening continued, and the JMA would continue to classify the system as a tropical depression until 1200UTC on April25, when it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. The JMA would continue to track the extratropical remnants of Kujira until they crossed the International Dateline on April30.|$|E

The cyclone turned northwest after formation while continuing to intensify, moving over Barbados by 09:00UTC on October30 with winds of 70mph (110km/h); as such, Tomas became the latest storm in a calendar year to strike the Windward Islands. The system reached hurricane intensity three hours later, and by 20:00UTC, attained its peak winds of 100mph (160km/h) while moving across St. Lucia. After moving into the Caribbean, a sharp increase in wind shear and dry air entrainment caused Tomas to dramatically weaken, and the storm fell to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on November3.
