40|$|Advanced optical {{systems of}} telescopes and {{scientific}} instrumentation require high accuracy mounting and joining of components. Applications for deep UV, under high energetic radiation, for vacuum operation, or assemblies subjected to environmental loads (e. g. humidity and temperature) require a replacement of organic adhesives or <b>optical</b> <b>cement</b> {{by a more}} robust bonding agent. Soldering allows the bonding of different materials with an inorganic filler material. We present the optimization of the laser-based Solderjet Bumping for the mounting of optical components and {{the parameters of the}} bonding process for fused silica and LAK 9 G 15 (radiation resistant glass) with thermally matched metal mounts. The investigation covers the experimental determination and optimization of solder wetting to the respective base materials and the bond strengths achieved...|$|E
40|$|A Lambertian {{reference}} standard for uniformly scattering {{a beam of}} light is constructed of a plate having a planar surface with a layer of glue disposed on the surface. An evenly packed layer of monodisperse spheres is set in the layer, and when the standard is used for bi-directional (BRDF) measurements, the spheres are coated with a layer of highly relective substance, such as gold or silver. When the standard is used for bi-directional transmittance distribution function (BTDF) measurements, the spheres are of a transparent material and are provided with a roughened surface, as by acid etching. In this case, the layer of glue is an <b>optical</b> <b>cement,</b> and the plate is of glass, with the spheres, the layer, and the plate all possessing a similar refractive index...|$|E

Most modern <b>optical</b> <b>cements</b> for bonding glass elements also block UV light, negating the need for a UV filter. UV photographers must {{go to great lengths to}} find lenses with no cement or coatings.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Here a {{photonic}} crystal plate polarizer (with periodic air gaps), operating over a broad wavelength range extending from 1000 nm to 1770 nm {{and with a}} wide angular field of 16 ◦ measured in air, is suggested. The polarizer has an average degree of polarization equal to 0. 9999, and a high extinction ratio (> 8. 308 × 104) in transmitted light. Since the plate polarizer does not require <b>optical</b> <b>cements,</b> it is most suitable for use with high power laser systems. It is also smaller in size as compared with multilayered cube polarizers. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} {{account of the}} proton radiation hardness of Eljen Technology's EJ- 500 <b>optical</b> <b>cement</b> used {{in the construction of}} experiment detectors. The cement was embedded into five plastic scintillator tiles which were each exposed to one of five different levels of radiation by a 50 MeV proton beam produced at the 88 -Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. A cosmic ray telescope setup was used to measure signal amplitudes before and after irradiation. Another post-radiation measurement was taken four months after the experiment to investigate whether the radiation damage to the cement recovers after a short amount of time. We verified that the radiation damage to the tiles increased with increasing dose but showed significant improvement after the four months time interval. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figures, 1 tabl...|$|E
3000|$|The WLS {{and clear}} fibers {{are of the}} type Bicron BCF- 91 A MC [...] and BCF- 98 MC, respectively, both with a {{diameter}} of 1 mm. The WLS fibers are inserted into the central duct running along {{the center of the}} bars. In order to increase the photo-electron yield, the fibers are glued along their whole length with the BC- 600 <b>optical</b> <b>cement.</b> A reflecting coating is placed at the free end of the fiber in order to further increase the yield (Pla-Dalmau et al., 2005). The other end of the WLS fiber is connected to optical connectors embedded in the scintillator bar. The connectors have been specially designed to either ensure the coupling of the WLS fibers with the clear fibers which transmit the green light to the cookie receiving the PM or to receive solidstate silicon photomultipliers for future replacement of the presently used multianode photomultipliers. When a muon hits the detector matrix, the X and Y bars whose intersection forms the pixel crossed by the particle emit UV light which is in turn captured by their WLS fibers inserted in their duct. The visible green light produced by the WLS fiber is transmitted to a clear fiber connected to a channel of the PM.|$|E
40|$|Solder joining is an all inorganic, {{adhesive}} free bonding {{technique for}} optical components and support structures of advanced optical systems. We established laser-based Solderjet Bumping for mounting and joining of elements with highest accuracies and stability. It {{has been proven}} for optical assemblies operating under harsh environmental conditions, high energetic or ionizing radiation, and for vacuum operation. Spaceborne instrumentation experiencing such conditions and can benefit from inorganic joining to avoid adhesives and <b>optical</b> <b>cements.</b> The metallization of components, necessary to provide solder wetting, mainly relies on well-adhering layer systems provided by physical vapor deposition (PVD). We present the investigation of electroless Ni(P) /Pd/Au plating as a cost-efficient alternative under bump metallization of complex or large components unsuitable for commercially available PVD. The electroless Ni(P) /Pd/Au plating is characterized with respect to layer adherence, solderability, and bond strength using SnAg 3 Cu 0. 5 lead-free solder alloy...|$|R

All of the fractional Fourier transform orders with the correct magnification can be achieved simultaneously by the suggested new setup with high precision, which consists of only two <b>optical</b> elements, a <b>cemented</b> linear varifocal lenses and a curvy image plane. This setup can offer practical applications for analyzing and processing of stationary or non-stationary signals...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACI: Accounts of {{epitaxial}} cements on pelmatozoan fragments {{assume a}} progressive reduction in numbers of sub-crystals, {{which in turn}} reduces boundary free energy. Pelmatozoan grainstones from Hadeland, Norway, show several departures from this model. In some a specific event, such as an abrupt change in water chemistry, increased the numbers of sub-crystals, which ranged from forms with planar faces, through those showing distorted faces and growth zones, to crystallites embayed by dissolution. Many ossicles show complete or partial dissolution, with subsequent growth of <b>cements</b> restoring <b>optical</b> continuity. The <b>cement</b> stratigraphy suggests that these features have a common cause, with local variations in concentration of some non-essential ion occuning {{against a background of}} regional chemical change. Such variation on a centimeter scale is thought to reflect near-surface diagenesis...|$|R
40|$|For cutting {{applications}} of sheet thicknesses up to 1 mm a compact diode laser system of high brilliance has been developed. By {{the combination of}} three different wavelengths {{as well as two}} polarization states six linear polarized diode laser bars are superimposed nearly without loss in beam quality. The maximum optical output power amounts to 155 W at a beam parameter product of about 22 mm mrad. The wavelength- and polarization-multiplexing is realized with one <b>cemented</b> <b>optical</b> component consisting of edge filters, a / 4 -retardation plate and a polarization beam splitter. The linear shaped beam of the six superimposed diode laser bars is symmetrized by micro step mirror beam shaping technology. Limited by manufacturing tolerances and particularly the mounting process of the diode laser bars, the system reaches the limits of incoherent beam multiplexing of six broad area diode laser bars. Combined with beam expanding and focussing optics, cutting experiments on differen t metallic and organic materials with sheet thicknesses ranging from 0. 1 to 1 mm have been realized...|$|R
40|$|Osteo-odonto-keratoprostheses (OOKP) is {{a unique}} form of keratoprosthesis {{involving}} surgical removal of a tooth root and surrounding bone from the patient which are then used to construct an osteo-odonto lamina into which an <b>optical</b> cylinder is <b>cemented.</b> The OOKP procedure is successful and capable of withstanding the very hostile ocular environments found in severe Stevens–Johnson syndrome, pemphigoid, chemical burns, trachoma and multiple corneal graft failure. The existing procedure is complex and time consuming in terms of operative time, and additionally involves sacrifice of the oral structures. This paper discusses the rational search for a “synthetic” analogue of the dental lamina, capable of mimicking those features of the natural system {{that are responsible for}} the success of OOKP. In this study the degradation of selected commercial and natural bioceramics was tested in vitro using a purpose-designed resorption assay. Degradation rate was compared with tooth and bone, which are currently used in OOKP lamina. At normal physiological pH the degradation of bioceramics was equivalent to tooth and bone; however, at pH 6. 5 – 5. 0, associated with infectious and inflamed tissues, the bioceramics degrade more rapidly. At lower pH the degradation rate decreased in the following order: calcium carbonate corals > biphasic calcium phosphates > hydroxyapatite. Porosity did not significantly influence these degradation rates. Such degradation is likely to compromise the stability and viability of the synthetic OOKP. Consequently more chemically stable materials are required that are optimized for the surrounding ocular environment...|$|R
