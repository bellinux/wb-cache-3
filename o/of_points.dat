5|$|On 14 February in Vikersund, Prevc won {{the event}} despite sliding upon landing (he {{remained}} {{on his feet}} nevertheless), which rarely happens in ski jumping. By winning the second event in Almaty on 28 February, Prevc secured his first World Cup title, six events {{before the end of}} the season. At the end of the season, Prevc broke several statistical records. He won the highest number <b>of</b> <b>points,</b> victories, and podium finishes in a single season (2303 points, 15 victories and 22 podiums in total, the previous records being 2083 points, 13 victories, and 20 podiums by Gregor Schlierenzauer from the 2008/09 season). Other records include the point difference between the first and the second in the overall standings (813), the best average <b>of</b> <b>points</b> per event (79.4), and the highest number <b>of</b> <b>points</b> in the Four Hills Tournament (1139.4). By winning the ski flying title, Prevc became the first ski jumper to win the title for three years in a row.|$|E

5000|$|One useful variant is the {{homotopy}} category <b>of</b> <b>pointed</b> spaces. A pointed space means a pair (X,x) with X a {{topological space}} and x {{a point in}} X, called the base point. The category Top* <b>of</b> <b>pointed</b> spaces has objects the pointed spaces, and a morphism f: X → Y is a continuous map that takes the base <b>point</b> <b>of</b> X to the base <b>point</b> <b>of</b> Y. The naive homotopy category <b>of</b> <b>pointed</b> spaces has the same objects, and morphisms are homotopy classes <b>of</b> <b>pointed</b> maps (meaning that the base point remains fixed throughout the homotopy). Finally, the [...] "true" [...] homotopy category <b>of</b> <b>pointed</b> spaces is obtained from the category Top* by inverting the pointed maps that are weak homotopy equivalences.|$|R

5|$|Additional minor classifications {{included}} the combativity classification, {{which was a}} compilation <b>of</b> <b>points</b> gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Alessandro Petacchi was the original winner, but with all his 2007 Giro results forfeited, it appears there is no official winner of this award.

5|$|Combat is turn-based, {{with each}} {{character}} in the player's party receiving action points {{at the beginning of}} the player's turn. The number received is dependent on the items the player character has equipped and the skills the character or creations possess. Each action uses a specific number <b>of</b> <b>points,</b> for example, moving one square takes a single point and attacks or spells take five. Attacking or spellcasting with fewer than ten action points immediately ends the character's turn, otherwise a character can continue to act until they run out <b>of</b> <b>points.</b> Most enemies will attack the player on sight, retreating in terror if they reach a certain threshold of damage without being killed. Other specialized behaviors are also present, including creatures which call for help, or creatures which act as sentries and retreat to an ambush location when threatened. Creations made by the player character can also be controlled by a similar artificial intelligence, or the player can invest more essence in the creation's intelligence and control them manually.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{location}} <b>of</b> <b>point</b> excitation {{force is}} an important factor to influence sound radiation of underwater structure. A vibroacoustic model of a simply supported rectangular plate covered by decoupling coating is presented. The influences of the locations and the number <b>of</b> <b>point</b> excitation force to sound radiation power insertion loss are analyzed. The results show that: 1) The location <b>of</b> <b>point</b> excitation force has much influence to sound radiation power insertion loss; 2) The average sound radiation power insertion loss is closer to convergence as the number <b>of</b> <b>point</b> excitation force becomes larger; 3) When The location <b>of</b> <b>point</b> excitation force is closer to the corner of plate, sound radiation power insertion loss compares well with that of multi-point average. When plate model is used to measure the performance of noise reduction of decoupling coating, the location <b>of</b> <b>point</b> excitation force should be located of the position from a corner of the tested plate so that as many plate modes as possible are excited.

5|$|In {{the theory}} of cluster analysis, the nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} is an algorithm that can speed up several methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering. These are methods that take a collection <b>of</b> <b>points</b> as input, and create a hierarchy of clusters <b>of</b> <b>points</b> by repeatedly merging pairs of smaller clusters to form larger clusters. The clustering methods that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm {{can be used for}} include Ward's method, complete-linkage clustering, and single-linkage clustering; these all work by repeatedly merging the closest two clusters but use different definitions of the distance between clusters. The cluster distances for which the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm works are called reducible and are characterized by a simple inequality among certain cluster distances.|$|E
