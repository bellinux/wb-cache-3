5|$|Aspinall {{worked closely}} with Epstein, who {{provided}} weekly notes for Aspinall {{to give to the}} group's stage act, their concert appearances, and the fees they would receive. The Beatles had to travel in Aspinall's van along with their equipment, but British roads in the early 1960s were notoriously pot-holed and slow to navigate. Ringo Starr remembered that the travelling never seemed to stop during the early tours of Britain in Aspinall's van, as they would be driven up and down Great Britain with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> in the passenger seat, but with the other three on a hard bench seat in the back.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the entire}} party, none were skilled skiers and only Bernacchi and Armitage had any {{experience}} with dog-sledges. The {{results of the}} men's early efforts to master these techniques were not encouraging, and tended to reinforce Scott's preference for man-hauling. The dangers of the unfamiliar conditions were confirmed when, on 11 March, a party returning from an attempted journey to Cape Crozier became stranded on an icy slope during a blizzard. In their attempts to find safer ground, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> Able Seaman George Vince, slid {{over the edge of}} a cliff and was killed. His body was never recovered; a cross with a simple inscription, erected in his memory, still stands at the summit of the Hut Point promontory.|$|E

25|$|Ranulf was {{probably}} {{born in the}} Cotentin Peninsula at Soules, the family's seigneurie near Saint-Lô.

As David's tenant, Ranulf held Great Doddington on the former's Honour of Huntingdon.

Patel is yet to play any further 50-over tournaments for the U.S. national side – he was selected in the U.S. squad for the 2015 Americas Twenty20 Championship, but withdrew the month before the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Following the convictions, Hanns Martin Schleyer, {{a former}} {{officer of the}} SS and NSDAP member who was then President of the German Employers' Association (and thus {{one of the most}} {{powerful}} industrialists in West Germany) was abducted in a violent kidnapping. On 5 September 1977, Schleyer's convoy was stopped by the kidnappers reversing a car into the path of Schleyer's vehicle, causing the Mercedes he was being driven in to crash. Once the convoy was stopped, five masked assailants immediately shot and killed the three policemen and the driver and took Schleyer hostage. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> (Sieglinde Hofmann) produced her weapon from a pram she was pushing down the road.|$|E
25|$|During the War of 1812, while Larned was dining with a {{group of}} {{prominent}} citizens in Shelby County, Kentucky, word came to the group from Governor Isaac Shelby that General William Henry Harrison was in danger of being overwhelmed by British General Henry Procter and his Indian allies. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> Colonel Owen, undertook the organization of a regiment, including Larned and commanded by Governor Shelby himself, to reinforce Harrison's troops. Many of the regiment were slaughtered by the Indians after surrendering to the British, in an event known as the River Raisin Massacre.

25|$|Settlements by the Polynesians were of two categories: {{the hamlet}} and the village. The {{size of the}} island {{inhabited}} determined {{whether or not a}} hamlet would be built. The larger volcanic islands usually had hamlets because of the many zones that could be divided across the island. Food and resources were more plentiful. These settlements of four to five houses (usually with gardens) were established so {{that there would be no}} overlap between the zones. Villages, on the other hand, were built on the coasts of smaller islands and consisted of thirty or more houses—in the case of atolls, on only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>group</b> so that food cultivation was on the others. Usually these villages were fortified with walls and palisades made of stone and wood.|$|E
25|$|Thallium is a soft, {{reactive}} metal (MH 1.0), {{so much so}} that it has no structural uses. It has a close-packed crystalline structure (BCN 6+6) but an abnormally large interatomic distance that has been attributed to partial ionisation of the thallium atoms. Although compounds in the +1 (mostly ionic) oxidation state are the more numerous, thallium has an appreciable chemistry in the +3 (largely covalent) oxidation state, as seen in its chalcogenides and trihalides. It is the only <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Group</b> 13 elements to react with air at room temperature, slowly forming the amphoteric oxide Tl2O3. It forms anionic thallates such as Tl3TlO3, Na3Tl(OH)6, NaTlO2, and KTlO2, and is present as the Tl− thallide anion in the compound CsTl. Thallium forms Zintl phases, such as Na2Tl, Na2K21Tl19, CsTl and Sr5Tl3H.|$|E

The new program was known as a tosser/scanner. The tosser produced a file that was similar (or identical) to the output from the normal netmail scan, however, these files were then compressed and attached to a normal netmail message as an attachment. This message was then sent to a special address on the remote system. After receiving netmail as normal, the scanner on the remote system looked for these messages, unpacked them, and put them into the same public forum on the original system.|$|E
