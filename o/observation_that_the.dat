5|$|Although Malaysia's acting Transport Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, who is {{also the}} country's Defence Minister, denied the {{existence}} of problems between the participating countries, academics said that because of regional conflicts, there were genuine trust issues involved in co-operation and sharing intelligence, and that these were hampering the search. International relations experts said entrenched rivalries over sovereignty, security, intelligence, and national interests made meaningful multilateral co-operation very difficult. A Chinese academic made the <b>observation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parties were searching independently; thus it was not a multilateral search effort. The Guardian noted the Vietnamese permission given for Chinese aircraft to overfly its airspace as a positive sign of co-operation. Vietnam temporarily scaled back its search operations after the country's Deputy Transport Minister cited a lack of communication from Malaysian officials despite requests for more information. China, through the official Xinhua News Agency, said that the Malaysian government ought to take charge and conduct the operation with greater transparency, a point echoed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry days later.|$|E
5|$|Among {{investigators}} {{there is}} disagreement regarding the terminology {{used to describe}} the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some investigators believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the <b>observation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others, consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.|$|E

5|$|Douglas Carl Engelbart (January 30, 1925– July 2, 2013) was an American {{engineer}} and inventor, {{and an early}} computer and Internet pioneer. He {{is best known for}} his work on founding the field of human–computer interaction, particularly while at his Augmentation Research Center Lab in SRI International, which resulted in creation of the computer mouse, and the development of hypertext, networked computers, and precursors to graphical user interfaces. These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968. Engelbart's Law, the <b>observation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after him.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, Ryan Schott {{and colleagues}} made a more {{comprehensive}} analysis of cranial dome ontogeny in S. validum. The {{study found that the}} parietosquamosal shelf conserved the arrangement of ornamentation throughout growth, and that vascularity of the frontoparietal domes decreased with size. It also found that dome shape and size was strongly correlated with growth, and that growth was allometric (in contrast to isometric) from flat to domed, supporting Ornatotholus as a juvenile Stegoceras. They also hypothesized that this model of dome growth, with dramatic changes from juvenile to adult, was the common developmental trajectory of pachycephalosaurs. These researchers noted that though Williamson and Carr's <b>observation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> supratemporal fenestrae closed with age was generally correct, there was still a high degree of individual variation in the size of these fenestrae, regardless {{of the size of the}} frontoparietal, and this feature may therefore have been independent of ontogeny.|$|E
5|$|Over time, the Universe and its {{contents}} have evolved; for example, the relative population of quasars and galaxies has changed and space itself has expanded. Due to this expansion, scientists on Earth can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away even though that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion {{is consistent with the}} <b>observation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> light from distant galaxies has been redshifted; the photons emitted have been stretched to longer wavelengths and lower frequency during their journey. Analyses of Type Ia supernovae indicate that the spatial expansion is accelerating.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court, {{reversing}} the Fifth Circuit, {{held that the}} NLRB decision was appropriate because its interpretation of the NLRA was permissible. The Court explained that the NLRB is entrusted with the responsibility to adapt the NLRA to changing times and {{that as a result}} courts reviewing its decisions only have the authority to reject its interpretations of the NLRA if those decisions are impermissible under it.

5|$|The first {{quantitative}} {{estimate of}} the speed of light was made in 1676 by Rømer (see Rømer's determination {{of the speed of}} light). From the <b>observation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> periods of Jupiter's innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of , 26% lower than the actual value.|$|E
5|$|This {{proved that}} the unknown {{radioactive}} source originated from the decay of uranium and, coupled with the previous <b>observation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> source was different chemically from all known elements, proved beyond all doubt that a new element had been discovered. McMillan and Abelson published their results in a paper entitled Radioactive Element 93 in the Physical Review on May 27, 1940.

McMillan and Abelson's success compared to Nishina and Kimura's near miss {{can be attributed to the}} favorable half-life of 239Np for radiochemical analysis and quick decay of 239U, in contrast to the slower decay of 237U and extremely long half-life of 237Np.|$|E

5|$|Cabral {{was later}} passed over, {{possibly}} {{as a result}} of a quarrel with Manuel I, when a new fleet was assembled to establish a more robust presence in India. Having lost favor with the King, he retired to a private life of which few records survive. His accomplishments slipped mostly into obscurity for more than 300 years. Decades after Brazil's independence from Portugal in the 19th century, Cabral's reputation began to be rehabilitated by Emperor Pedro II of Brazil. Historians have long argued whether Cabral was Brazil's discoverer, and whether the discovery was accidental or intentional. The first question has been settled by the <b>observation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> few, cursory encounters by explorers before him were barely noticed at the time and contributed nothing to the future development and history of the land which would become Brazil, the sole Portuguese-speaking nation in the Americas. On the second question, no definite consensus has been formed, and the intentional discovery hypothesis lacks solid proof. Nevertheless, although he was overshadowed by contemporary explorers, Cabral today is regarded as a major figure of the Age of Discovery.|$|E
5|$|Many {{classification}} {{systems have}} been developed {{in an effort to}} predict difficulty of tracheal intubation, including the Cormack-Lehane classification system, the Intubation Difficulty Scale (IDS), and the Mallampati score. The Mallampati score is drawn from the <b>observation</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> size of the base of the tongue influences the difficulty of intubation. It is determined by looking at the anatomy of the mouth, and in particular the visibility of the base of palatine uvula, faucial pillars and the soft palate. Although such medical scoring systems may aid in the evaluation of patients, no single score or combination of scores can be trusted to specifically detect all and only those patients who are difficult to intubate. Furthermore, one study of experienced anesthesiologists, on the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system, found they did not score the same patients consistently over time, and that only 25% could correctly define all four grades of the widely used Cormack–Lehane classification system. Under certain emergency circumstances (e.g., severe head trauma or suspected cervical spine injury), it may be impossible to fully utilize these the physical examination and the various classification systems to predict the difficulty of tracheal intubation. In such cases, alternative techniques of securing the airway must be readily available.|$|E
