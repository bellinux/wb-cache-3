5|$|Because American {{football}} is a full-contact sport, head injuries are relatively common. According to the San Francisco Spine Institute at Seton Medical Center in Daly City, California, up to 1.5 million young men participate in football annually, {{and there are}} an estimated 1.2 million football-related injuries per year. An estimated 51% of injuries occur during training sessions, while 49% occur elsewhere. Injuries are nearly 5 times more likely to happen during contact training sessions than in controlled, non-contact sessions. Older players are at the most risk for injuries, while teams with experienced coaches and more assistant coaches are less likely to experience injuries. Fifty percent of injuries <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> the lower extremities (with knee injuries alone counting for roughly 36% of all injuries) and 30% <b>occur</b> <b>in</b> the upper extremities.|$|E
