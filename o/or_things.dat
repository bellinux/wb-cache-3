5|$|The {{practice}} of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back several centuries, with systems named after places, saints <b>or</b> <b>things</b> they hit before the formal start of naming in the Western Pacific. These included the Kamikaze, 1906 Hong Kong typhoon, 1922 Swatow typhoon and the 1934 Muroto typhoon.|$|E

Fuko is extremely enthralled by starfish, <b>or</b> <b>things</b> that are star-shaped, and will often go into short euphoric bouts where her awareness of her surroundings is completely overtaken.|$|E
5|$|The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution prohibits {{unreasonable}} {{searches and}} seizures. It requires governmental searches and seizures {{to be conducted}} only upon issuance of a warrant, judicially sanctioned by probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing {{the place to be}} searched and the persons <b>or</b> <b>things</b> to be seized. It is part of the Bill of Rights and was adopted in response to the abuse of the writ of assistance, a type of general search warrant issued by the British government, and a major source of tension in pre-Revolutionary America. The Fourth Amendment was introduced in Congress in 1789 by James Madison, along with the other amendments in the Bill of Rights, in response to Anti-Federalist objections to the new Constitution. Congress submitted the amendment to the states on September 28, 1789. By December 15, 1791, the necessary three-fourths of the states had ratified it. On March 1, 1792, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson announced the adoption of the amendment.|$|E

5|$|The {{practice}} of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back many years, with systems named after places <b>or</b> <b>things</b> they hit before the formal start of naming. The system currently used provides positive identification of severe weather systems {{in a brief}} form, that is readily understood and recognized by the public. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems is generally given to the Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge who named systems between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming weather systems subsequently fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived {{in the latter part}} of World War II for the Western Pacific. Formal naming schemes have subsequently been introduced for the North and South Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins as well as the Australian region and Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} of using names to identify tropical cyclones goes back several centuries, with storms named after places, saints <b>or</b> <b>things</b> they hit before the formal start of naming in each basin. Examples of such names are the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane and the 1938 New England hurricane. The system currently in place provides identification of tropical cyclones {{in a brief}} form that is easily understood and recognized by the public. The credit for the first usage of personal names for weather systems {{is given to the}} Queensland Government Meteorologist Clement Wragge, who named tropical cyclones and anticyclones between 1887 and 1907. This system of naming fell into disuse for several years after Wragge retired, until it was revived {{in the latter part of}} World War II for the Western Pacific. Over the following decades formal naming schemes were introduced for several tropical cyclone basins, including the North and South Atlantic, Eastern, Central, Western and Southern Pacific basins as well as the Australian region and Indian Ocean.|$|E

25|$|The state name {{is simply}} México {{according}} to the 1917 Constitution of the United Mexican States, but to distinguish it from both {{the city and the}} country it is most often called Estado de México. The demonym used to refer to people and things from the state is mexiquense, distinct from mexicano ("Mexican"), which describes the people <b>or</b> <b>things</b> from the country as a whole.|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{original}} attractions are outside {{the gates of the}} current-day theme park along Grand Ave. at the California Marketplace, mostly things which would no longer be considered interesting to today's audience, <b>or</b> <b>things</b> which were merely there for decoration. Near the restrooms behind Berry Place are the waterfall overshooting the water wheel and historic gristmill grindstone, a replica of George Washington's Mount Vernon estate fireplace hearth, and what remains of the visible beehive. Some attractions still exist, but have been incorporated into backstage areas, such as the Rock Garden, now an employee smoking area. Other attractions have been removed, such as the historic volcano, and the cross-section of giant sequoia with age rings denoting historic events such as Christopher Columbus visiting America.|$|E

25|$|The {{determinants}} of job performance consist of factors {{having to do}} with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance, job performance is a result of the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts <b>or</b> <b>things),</b> procedural knowledge (knowledge of what needs to be done and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level of effort to expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen). The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.|$|E
25|$|What {{already has}} been {{observed}} directly in many systems are the lower non-relativistic velocities of matter orbiting further out from what are presumed to be black holes. Direct Doppler measures of water masers surrounding the nuclei of nearby galaxies have revealed a very fast Keplerian motion, only possible with {{a high concentration of}} matter in the center. Currently, the only known objects that can pack enough matter in such a small space are black holes, <b>or</b> <b>things</b> that will evolve into black holes within astrophysically short timescales. For active galaxies farther away, the width of broad spectral lines can be used to probe the gas orbiting near the event horizon. The technique of reverberation mapping uses variability of these lines to measure the mass and perhaps the spin of the black hole that powers active galaxies.|$|E
25|$|Yet another circumstantial {{evidence}} is that Jagannath is sometimes identified with or substituted for Buddha, as the ninth avatar of Vishnu by Hindus, {{when it could}} have been substituted for any other avatar. Jagannath was worshipped in Puri by the Odias as a form of Buddha from a long time. Jayadeva, in Gita Govinda also has described Buddha as one among the Dasavatara. Indrabhuti, the ancient Buddhist king describes Jagannath as a Buddhist deity in Jnanasidhi. Further, as a Buddhist king, Indrabhuti worshipped Jagannath. This is not unique to the coastal state of Odisha, but possibly also influenced Buddhism in Nepal and Tibet. In Nepal, Buddha is also worshipped as Jagannath in Nepal. This {{circumstantial evidence}} has been questioned because the reverent mention of Jagannath in the Indrabhuti text may merely be a coincidental homonym, may indeed refer to the Buddha, because the same name may refer to two different persons <b>or</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E

25|$|Fiscal {{contributions}} were {{of prime}} concern to policymakers in the 17th century, {{as they have}} remained ever since, for the wise country would not spend above its revenues. By Petty's time, England was engaged in war with Holland, {{and in the first}} three chapters of Treatise of Taxes and Contributions, Petty sought to establish principles of taxation and public expenditure, to which the monarch could adhere, when deciding how {{to raise money for the}} war. Petty lists six kinds of public charge, namely defence, governance, the pastorage of men's souls, education, the maintenance of impotents of all sorts and infrastructure, <b>or</b> <b>things</b> of universal good. He then discusses general and particular causes of changes in these charges. He thinks that there is great scope for reduction of the first four public charges, and recommends increased spending on care for the elderly, sick, orphans, etc., as well as the government employment of supernumeraries.|$|E
