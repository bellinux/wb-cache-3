Wayne Gretzky said of Crosby, [...] "He's proven <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>that</b> he's the best player in the game today.

Unless you put two guys on him, he'll kill you in a game". In 2016, Mario Lemieux praised his protégé for his ability to play both sides of the puck, [...] "I think he's more of a complete player. Defensively, I think he's improved a lot over the last couple of years." [...] On January 27, 2017, in a ceremony during the All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, Crosby was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players in history. In that same year, Fox Sports ranked Crosby 15th on their [...] "21 greatest athletes of the 21st century (so far)" [...] list. In a survey conducted by Sportsnet in June 2017, Crosby was voted by Canadians to be the greatest athlete of the 21st century.|$|E

They are designed to elicit identifying responses from people. The statements can then be developed into longer and more sophisticated paragraphs and seem to reveal great amounts of detail about a person.

It was yet early in the day. Isabel dressed carefully, ordered her carriage and went forth to pay visits. New acquaintances must see that she was not a crushed wife. She wanted to tell every one that her husband was getting better. The splendid pride of her young nature rose up for conquest. Pity was not for Isabel. And after a pleasant outing she returned to find the house, withal, more cheerful than for weeks back. Nurses had gone, and Reginald's unrestrained shouts echoed at will.|$|E

A crowd blocked the pavement, and hustled and shoved at the doors,--roughs, and soldiers off duty, and ladies and gentlemen whom the Judge and Stephen knew, and some of whom they spoke to. All of these were come out of curiosity, that they might see for themselves any who had the temerity to bid on a neighbor's household goods. The long hall, which ran from street to street, was packed, the people surging backward and forward, and falling roughly against the mahogany pieces; and apologizing, and scolding, and swearing all in a breath. The Judge, holding tightly to Stephen, pushed his way fiercely to the stand, vowing <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>that</b> the commotion was a secession trick to spoil the furniture and stampede the sale.

He remembered the thrill that was his, a callow youth of fifteen, when, in Tempas Butte, through lack of a fourth man, Tom Galsworthy, the gambler, had said, [...] "Get in, Kid; take a hand." [...] That thrill was his now. The bald, typewritten sentences seemed gorged with mystery. [...] "Our Mr. Howison will call upon you at your hotel. He is to be trusted. We must not be seen together.

You may be reprobates and {{not be aware of}} it, if you do not examine and prove your own selves. It is {{therefore}} FOR THY LIFE, wherefore do not deceive thyself. I have given you before a description of a righteous man, namely, that he is one made so of God by imputation--by an inward principle, and one that brings forth fruit to God.

6000|$|It {{was three}} evenings later {{that we heard}} {{uncertain}} footfalls on the flagstones of the verandah, then a sort of brushing sound against the wood of the long, open window.

He came in, and seeming not to know quite where he went, took stand by the hearth, and putting up his dark hand, gripped the mantelshelf. Then, as if recollecting himself, he said: [...] "Gude evenin', sir; beg pardon, M'm." [...] No more for a full minute; but his hand, taking some little china thing, turned it over and over without ceasing, and down his broken face tears ran. Then, very suddenly, he said: [...] "She's gone." [...] And his hand turned <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> <b>that</b> little china thing, and the tears went on rolling down. Then, stumbling, and swaying like a man in drink, he made his way out again into the moonlight.

She thought that she understood her child and all her feelings. She recognised the violence of the shock which must be encountered before Lily could be brought to acknowledge such a change in her heart. But if the thing could be done, Lily would be a happy woman. When once done it would be in all respects a blessing. And if it were not done, might not Lily's life be blank, lonely, and loveless to the end?
