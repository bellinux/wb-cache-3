5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis, {{responsible}} for New York City's green areas, and Ron Delsener, {{one of the}} city's most influential concert promoters, developed the idea of helping Central Park financially with a free open-air concert, under the legal guidance <b>of</b> <b>Bob</b> Donnelly. The city would use profits from merchandising, television, and video rights to renovate the park. Earlier park performances by Elton John and James Taylor showed that this concept could be a success.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{transmission}} <b>of</b> <b>Bob</b> & Rose, Davies {{was approached by}} Abbott to write for his new BBC show Linda Green. He accepted the offer and wrote an episode where the titular character (portrayed by Liza Tarbuck) and her friends attend a schoolmate's funeral and become psychologically haunted by the deceased woman's solitary life. His first work for the BBC in eight years prompted them to approach him with additional concepts for period dramas, which he invariably declined as his sole intent was to revive Doctor Who, which had then been on hiatus for over a decade.|$|E

5|$|A new, {{extensive}} {{hurricane warning}} was issued late on August18 as forecasts showed Bob moving directly over southern New England. The warning covered areas between Cape Henlopen, Delaware to Plymouth, Massachusetts, including Long Island and Long Island Sound. Early on August19, all watches and warnings south of Cape Lookout, North Carolina were discontinued and the hurricane warning was extended northward to encompass areas south of Eastport, Maine. The Canadian Hurricane Centre began issuing warnings for Atlantic Canada later that day. Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick were placed under wind and heavy rain warnings. By {{the morning of}} August20, all watches and warnings in the United States were discontinued; however, a brief tropical storm warning was declared for coastal Maine between Rockland and Eastport before the remnants <b>of</b> <b>Bob</b> moved through eastern Canada. The advisories for Atlantic Canada were later discontinued after the system {{moved out of the}} region.|$|E
5|$|About 19hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) {{issued a}} {{tropical}} storm warning from Apalachicola to Venice, Florida, which was preceded by {{a tropical storm}} watch six hours prior. As the storm intensified further, the NHC issued a hurricane warning from Apalachicola to Anclote Key, and extended the tropical storm warning westward to Fort Walton Beach. The agency later issued a tropical storm warning for the Atlantic coast from Cape Canaveral to Little River Inlet in South Carolina. Officials ordered evacuations for barrier islands in nine Florida counties along the gulf coast, and about 3,000people stayed in shelters. Government offices closed along the storm's projected path in the state. Later, the storm forced the cancellation of part <b>of</b> <b>Bob</b> Dole's bus tour through New York, and postponed {{a search for the}} wreck of TWA Flight 800. Game one of the 1996 World Series was postponed by one day due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|By August18, the NHC {{noted that}} the {{hurricane}} was asymmetrical, having uneven distribution of the wind radii. Later that day, deep convection continued to form and an eye later appeared on satellite imagery. Early the next day, the eye became increasingly defined as the center <b>of</b> <b>Bob</b> passed roughly 35mi (55km) from the North Carolina coastline. By 0600UTC, Hurricane Hunters recorded flight level winds of 140mph (225km/h), corresponding to surface winds of 115mph (185km/h). At this time, the barometric pressure of the storm also decreased to 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg), the lowest pressure recorded during the storm. After attaining this intensity, the hurricane tracked quickly northeast at 25mph (35km/h), steered by the trough over the southeast United States, an upper-level cutoff low over the Great Lakes Region and the subtropical ridge over the Atlantic.|$|E
