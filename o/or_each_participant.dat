40|$|When a key press {{causes a}} stimulus, the key press is {{perceived}} later and the stimulus earlier than key presses and stimuli presented independently. This bias in time perception {{has been linked}} to the intention to produce the effect and thus been called intentional binding (IB). In recent studies {{it has been shown that}} the IB effect is stronger when participants believed that they caused the effect stimulus compared to when they believed that another person caused the effect (Desantis et al., 2011). In this experiment we ask whether causal beliefs influence the perceived time of an effect when the putative effect occurs temporally close to another stimulus that is also an effect. In our study two participants performed the same task on connected computers with separate screens. Each trial started synchro- nously on both computers. When a participant pressed a key, a red and a yellow stimulus appeared as action effects simultaneously or with a slight delay of up to 50 ms. The partic- ipants’ task was to judge the temporal order of these two effect stimuli. Participants were either told that one participant caused one of the two stimuli while the other participant seated at the other computer caused the other stimulus, <b>or</b> <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> was told that he/she caused both stimuli. The different causal beliefs changed the perceived time of the effects’ appearance relative to each other. When participants believed they each caused one effect, their “own” effect was perceived earlier than the other participant’s effect. When the participants believed each caused both effects, no difference in the perceived temporal order of the red and yellow effect was found. These results confirm that higher order causal beliefs change the perceived time of an action effect even in a setting in which the occurrence of the putative effect can be directly compared to a reference stimulus...|$|E

40|$|Multi User Virtual Worlds {{provide a}} {{simulated}} immersive 3 D {{environment that is}} similar to the real world. Popular examples include Second Life and OpenSim. The multi-user nature of these simulations means that there are significant computational demands on the processes that render the different avatar-centric views of the world for <b>each</b> <b>participant,</b> which change with every movement <b>or</b> interaction <b>each</b> <b>participant</b> makes. Maintaining quality of experience can be difficult when the density of avatars within the same area suddenly grows beyond a relatively small number.

In this paper we make a start to assessing the feasibility of using the Cloud for virtual worlds by measuring the performance of virtual worlds in virtual machines of the type used for Clouds. A suitable benchmark is researched and formulated and the construction of a test-bed for carrying out load experiments is described. The system is then used to evaluate the performance of virtual worlds running in virtual machines. The results are presented and analysed before presenting the design of a system that we have built for managing virtual worlds in the Cloud. ...|$|R

(Chiropractic) Purpose: To {{establish}} the immediate effect of sacroiliac joint adjustment on functional leg length Method: Seventy participants were randomly divided in two equal groups. Participants of Group A (n= 35) leg length was measured pre and immediately post adjustment of dysfunctional sacroiliac joint. Group B (n= 35) {{received the same}} assessment protocol with no adjustment being administered. The trial consisted of one treatment session only in which all data was obtained. Objective data consisted of measuring participant’s leg length from the anterior superior iliac spine to {{the apex of the}} medial malleolus using the standardized tape measure method. Subjective data was obtained through performing four sacroiliac joint orthopaedic tests <b>or</b> <b>each</b> <b>participant’s</b> and recording the results. Results: The subjective results showed positive results in at least three out of four of the orthopedic tests for the participants of both groups. The sacral thrust technique and sacroiliac joint compression showed a greater percentage positive result in Group A at 91. 4 % where as the sacroiliac joint distraction was positive in 94. 3 % of the participants in Group B. Gaenslen’s showed the least accuracy with a positive result in 82. 9 % of participants in Group A and 74. 3 % in Group B. Objectively, Shapiro-Wilk analysis indicated a statistically significant (p = 0. 014) change in the length of the left leg after treatment in Group A. A significant change in the length of both the right (p = 0. 002) and left (p = 0. 034) leg was found in Group B following assessment. Conclusion: The study showed that adjustment of the sacroiliac joint does not consistently result in change in functional leg length inequality. This information suggests that the assessment of functional leg length should not be used as the sole assessment tool in the diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Practitioners should rather incorporate a variety of assessment methods as the inequality may be caused by factors unrelated to the dysfunction...|$|R

Results indicate that on the immediate memory participants in the positive mood condition were more susceptible to false memory. On the immediate memory test it was also found that participants in the neutral condition had the highest acceptance rates for target words, suggesting they had the best true memory. On the delayed memory test, it was found that participants in the negative condition were less likely to accept all types of words than participants in the negative and positive emotion conditions. This finding is consistent with what was found on the immediate memory test. Interestingly, on the delayed memory test participants in the positive emotional condition actually increased their acceptance rate for targets while participants in the neutral condition decreased their acceptance rates and participants in the negative condition kept their target rates consistent...|$|R

The current study found that if an individual feels their mentoring partner is meeting their expectations they are more committed to continuation of the relationship, trust their partner more, and feel that the relationship itself is more effective. Additionally, those individuals who reported higher levels of relationship effectiveness, trust in one’s partner, and commitment to the mentoring relationship were more likely to continue the mentoring relationship after completion of the program. This provides organizers of formal mentoring programs an insight into these formally arranged relationships – if the relationships are not as beneficial as a mentor or protégé expects, they will only stay in the relationship while the program is active.

40|$|When {{each eye}} views a {{different}} stimulus, visual perception alternates irregularly between them: binocular rivalry. One theory is that: reciprocal inhibition between neurons processing the two stimuli yields active (dominant) and suppressed neurons—we see the stimulus processed by active neurons; adaptation of active neurons eventually reverses activity—perception changes. We know that highly active neurons adapt faster than sluggishly active neurons. Hence, {{if we had}} some way of measuring the early activity of the active population, we could predict when a rivalry alternation will take place. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure brain activity to a 1000 -ms display of dichoptic, orthogonally oriented, sine-wave gratings. Then we turned off both gratings for a 200 -ms, dark gap, before showing the same rival gratings for another 1000 ms. We followed this by a mask then an inter-trial interval (ITI). Thirteen participants pressed keys during the ITI of numerous trials to say whether perception changed at the gap <b>or</b> not. <b>Each</b> <b>participant</b> also responded to numerous non-rivalry trials in which the gratings had identical orientations for the two eyes and for which the orientation of both either changed physically at the gap or did not. We found, with simple averaging (rather than requiring pattern classifiers), that greater activity about 180 ms after initial onset of rival stimuli predicted a change in perception more than 1000 ms later, after the gap. We conclude that the predictive activity is consistent with adaptation’s being responsible for binocular rivalry alternations...|$|R

Os aportes teórico-metodológicos estão embasados no Interacionismo Sociodiscursivo de Bronckart (2007; 2008), nas concepções de trabalho desenvolvidas pela Clínica da Atividade e Ergonomia e nas características de trabalho de Machado (2010). Participaram do estudo seis docentes universitários de Língua Inglesa que utilizam as TIC no trabalho. Os dados foram gerados via internet, via e-mails e Moodle. Cada participante produziu um texto em que relatou os usos que faria dessas ferramentas. Os resultados indicam que os docentes fazem usos semelhantes das ferramentas e que há impedimentos no uso das TIC para os docentes da universidade pública. This article {{presents}} representations {{about the kind}} of work that university professors hope to achieve when using Information & Communications Technology (ICT) in the classroom. The theoretical background is based on Socio-discursive Interactionism, theories about work as developed in Clinical Activity and Ergonomics and in the characteristics of work proposed by Machado (2010). Six English language professors that use ICT at work participated in the research project. Data were collected via internet, through e-mail <b>or</b> Moodle. <b>Each</b> <b>participant</b> provided a text on their experiences and the use of ICT. The results indicate that university professors use the ICT in the same way, butsome restrictions to this matter are appointed by public university professors...|$|R
