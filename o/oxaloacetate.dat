5|$|In the liver, the {{carboxylation}} of cytosolic pyruvate into intra-mitochondrial <b>oxaloacetate</b> is {{an early}} step in the gluconeogenic pathway, which converts lactate and de-aminated alanine into glucose, {{under the influence of}} high levels of glucagon and/or epinephrine in the blood. Here, the addition of <b>oxaloacetate</b> to the mitochondrion does not have a net anaplerotic effect, as another citric acid cycle intermediate (malate) is immediately removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into cytosolic <b>oxaloacetate,</b> which is ultimately converted into glucose, in a process that is almost the reverse of glycolysis.|$|E
5|$|Making these {{predictions}} is not trivial, {{even for}} simple systems. For example, <b>oxaloacetate</b> is formed by malate dehydrogenase within the mitochondrion. <b>Oxaloacetate</b> {{can then be}} consumed by citrate synthase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase or aspartate aminotransferase, feeding into the citric acid cycle, gluconeogenesis or aspartic acid biosynthesis, respectively. Being able to predict how much <b>oxaloacetate</b> goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of <b>oxaloacetate</b> {{as well as the}} concentration and kinetics of each of these enzymes. This aim of predicting the behaviour of metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms. Alternatively, one useful simplification of the metabolic modelling problem is to ignore the underlying enzyme kinetics and only rely on information about the reaction network's stoichiometry, a technique called flux balance analysis.|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH {{relies on the}} malate-aspartate shuttle (and to a lesser extent, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts <b>oxaloacetate</b> to malate, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing <b>oxaloacetate</b> and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD+. A transaminase converts the <b>oxaloacetate</b> to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.|$|E
5|$|Pyruvate {{molecules}} {{produced by}} glycolysis are actively transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane, {{and into the}} matrix where they can either be oxidized and combined with coenzyme A to form CO2, acetyl-CoA, and NADH, or they can be carboxylated (by pyruvate carboxylase) to form <b>oxaloacetate.</b> This latter reaction ”fills up” the amount of <b>oxaloacetate</b> in the citric acid cycle, and is therefore an anaplerotic reaction, increasing the cycle’s capacity to metabolize acetyl-CoA when the tissue's energy needs (e.g. in muscle) are suddenly increased by activity.|$|E
5|$|In plants, {{nitrogen}} {{is first}} assimilated into organic compounds {{in the form}} of glutamate, formed from alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia in the mitochondrion. In order to form other amino acids, the plant uses transaminases to move the amino group to another alpha-keto carboxylic acid. For example, aspartate aminotransferase converts glutamate and <b>oxaloacetate</b> to alpha-ketoglutarate and aspartate. Other organisms use transaminases for amino acid synthesis, too.|$|E
5|$|In the {{citric acid}} cycle, all the {{intermediates}} (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and <b>oxaloacetate)</b> are regenerated during each {{turn of the}} cycle. Adding more {{of any of these}} intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that the additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence, the addition of any one of them to the cycle has an anaplerotic effect, and its removal has a cataplerotic effect. These anaplerotic and cataplerotic reactions will, {{during the course of the}} cycle, increase or decrease the amount of <b>oxaloacetate</b> available to combine with acetyl-CoA to form citric acid. This in turn increases or decreases the rate of ATP production by the mitochondrion, and thus the availability of ATP to the cell.|$|E
5|$|Acetyl-CoA, on {{the other}} hand, derived from {{pyruvate}} oxidation, or from the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, is the only fuel to enter the citric acid cycle. With each turn of the cycle one molecule of acetyl-CoA is consumed for every molecule of <b>oxaloacetate</b> present in the mitochondrial matrix, and is never regenerated. It is the oxidation of the acetate portion of acetyl-CoA that produces CO2 and water, with the energy thus released captured {{in the form of}} ATP.|$|E
5|$|Although fat is {{a common}} way of storing energy, in {{vertebrates}} such as humans the fatty acids in these stores cannot be converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis as these organisms cannot convert acetyl-CoA into pyruvate; plants do, but animals do not, have the necessary enzymatic machinery. As a result, after long-term starvation, vertebrates need to produce ketone bodies from fatty acids to replace glucose in tissues such as the brain that cannot metabolize fatty acids. In other organisms such as plants and bacteria, this metabolic problem is solved using the glyoxylate cycle, which bypasses the decarboxylation step in the citric acid cycle and allows the transformation of acetyl-CoA to <b>oxaloacetate,</b> {{where it can be}} used for the production of glucose.|$|E
25|$|To cataplerotically remove <b>oxaloacetate</b> {{from the}} citric cycle, malate can be transported from the {{mitochondrion}} into the cytoplasm, decreasing {{the amount of}} <b>oxaloacetate</b> that can be regenerated. Furthermore, citric acid intermediates are constantly used to form a variety of substances such as the purines, pyrimidines and porphyrins.|$|E
25|$|PEPCase {{converts}} <b>oxaloacetate</b> into phosphoenolpyruvate {{and carbon}} dioxide.|$|E
25|$|In the {{citric acid}} cycle all the {{intermediates}} (e.g. citrate, iso-citrate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate and <b>oxaloacetate)</b> are regenerated during each {{turn of the}} cycle. Adding more {{of any of these}} intermediates to the mitochondrion therefore means that that additional amount is retained within the cycle, increasing all the other intermediates as one is converted into the other. Hence the addition of <b>oxaloacetate</b> greatly increases the amounts of all the citric acid intermediates, thereby increasing the cycle's capacity to metabolize acetyl CoA, converting its acetate component into CO2 and water, with the release of enough energy to form 11 ATP and 1 GTP molecule for each additional molecule of acetyl CoA that combines with <b>oxaloacetate</b> in the cycle.|$|E
25|$|Only plants {{possess the}} enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into <b>oxaloacetate</b> from which malate can be formed to {{ultimately}} {{be converted to}} glucose.|$|E
25|$|The {{pyruvate}} {{produced by}} glycolysis {{is an important}} intermediary in the conversion of carbohydrates into fatty acids and cholesterol. This occurs via the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA in the mitochondrion. However, this acetyl CoA needs to be transported into cytosol where the synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol occurs. This cannot occur directly. To obtain cytosolic acetyl-CoA, citrate (produced by the condensation of acetyl CoA with <b>oxaloacetate)</b> {{is removed from the}} citric acid cycle and carried across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the cytosol. There it is cleaved by ATP citrate lyase into acetyl-CoA and <b>oxaloacetate.</b> The <b>oxaloacetate</b> can be used for gluconeogenesis (in the liver), or it can be returned into mitochondrion as malate. The cytosolic acetyl-CoA is carboxylated by acetyl CoA carboxylase into malonyl CoA, the first committed step in the synthesis of fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is {{an enzyme}} in the lyase family {{used in the}} {{metabolic}} pathway of gluconeogenesis. It converts <b>oxaloacetate</b> into phosphoenolpyruvate and carbon dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Fatty acids {{are broken}} down to acetyl-CoA {{by means of}} beta {{oxidation}} inside the mitochondria, whereas fatty acids are synthesized from acetyl-CoA outside the mitochondria, in the cytosol. The two pathways are distinct, not only in where they occur, {{but also in the}} reactions that occur, and the substrates that are used. The two pathways are mutually inhibitory, preventing the acetyl-CoA produced by beta-oxidation from entering the synthetic pathway via the acetyl-CoA carboxylase reaction. It can also not be converted to pyruvate as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex reaction is irreversible. Instead the acetyl-CoA produced by the beta-oxidation of fatty acids condenses with <b>oxaloacetate,</b> to enter the citric acid cycle. During each turn of the cycle, two carbon atoms leave the cycle as CO2 in the decarboxylation reactions catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Thus each turn of the citric acid cycle oxidizes an acetyl-CoA unit while regenerating the <b>oxaloacetate</b> molecule with which the acetyl-CoA had originally combined to form citric acid. The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. Only plants possess the enzymes to convert acetyl-CoA into <b>oxaloacetate</b> from which malate can be formed to ultimately be converted to glucose.|$|E
25|$|The {{family also}} {{contains}} L-lactate dehydrogenases that catalyse {{the conversion of}} L-lactate to pyruvate, the last step in anaerobic glycolysis. Malate dehydrogenases that catalyse the interconversion of malate to <b>oxaloacetate</b> {{and participate in the}} citric acid cycle, and L-2-hydroxyisocaproate dehydrogenases are also members of the family. The N-terminus is a Rossmann NAD-binding fold and the C-terminus is an unusual alpha+beta fold.|$|E
25|$|The acetyl-CoA {{produced}} by beta oxidation enters the citric acid cycle in the mitochondrion by combining with <b>oxaloacetate</b> to form citrate. This {{results in the}} complete combustion of the acetyl-CoA to CO2 and water. The energy released in this process is captured {{in the form of}} 1 GTP and 11 ATP molecules per acetyl-CoA molecule oxidized. This is the fate of acetyl-CoA wherever beta oxidation of fatty acids occurs, except under certain circumstances in the liver.|$|E
25|$|During reverse {{electron}} transfer, complex I {{might be}} the most important site of superoxide production within mitochondria, with up to 5% of electrons being diverted to superoxide formation. Reverse electron transfer, the process by which electrons from the reduced ubiquinol pool (supplied by succinate dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, or dihydro-oorotate dehydrogenase in mammalian mitochondria) pass through complex I to reduce NAD+ to NADH, driven by the inner mitochondrial membrane potential electric potential. Although it is not precisely known under what pathological conditions reverse-electron transfer would occur in vivo, in vitro experiments indicate that it can be a very potent source of superoxide when succinate concentrations are high and <b>oxaloacetate</b> or malate concentrations are low.|$|E
25|$|As PEPCK acts at the {{junction}} between glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, it causes decarboxylation of a C4 molecule, creating a C3 molecule. As the first committed step in gluconeogenesis, PEPCK decarboxylates and phosphorylates <b>oxaloacetate</b> (OAA) for its conversion to PEP, when GTP is present. As a phosphate is transferred, the reaction results in a GDP molecule. When pyruvate kinase - the enzyme that normally catalyzes the reaction that converts PEP to pyruvate - is knocked out in mutants of Bacillus subtilis, PEPCK participates {{in one of the}} replacement anaplerotic reactions, working in the reverse direction of its normal function, converting PEP to OAA. Although this reaction is possible, the kinetics are so unfavorable that the mutants grow at a very slow pace or do not grow at all.|$|E
2500|$|PEPCK (...) is one {{of three}} {{decarboxylation}} enzymes used in the inorganic carbon concentrating mechanisms of C4 and CAM plants. The others are NADP-malic enzyme and NAD-malic enzyme. In C4 carbon fixation, carbon dioxide is first fixed by combination with phosphoenolpyruvate to form <b>oxaloacetate</b> in the mesophyll. In PEPCK-type C4 plants the <b>oxaloacetate</b> is then converted to aspartate, which travels to the bundle sheath. [...] In the bundle sheath cells, aspartate is converted back to <b>oxaloacetate.</b> PEPCK decarboxylates the bundle sheath <b>oxaloacetate,</b> releasing carbon dioxide, which is then fixed by the enzyme Rubisco.|$|E

2500|$|Citrate is an {{intermediate}} in the TCA cycle (aka TriCarboxylic Acid [...] cycle, Krebs cycle, Szent-Györgyi — Krebs cycle), a central metabolic pathway for animals, plants and bacteria. Citrate synthase catalyzes the condensation of <b>oxaloacetate</b> with acetyl CoA to form citrate. Citrate then {{acts as the}} substrate for aconitase and is converted into aconitic acid. The cycle ends with regeneration of <b>oxaloacetate.</b> This series of chemical reactions {{is the source of}} two-thirds of the food-derived energy in higher organisms.

2500|$|At {{least two}} {{pathways}} {{exist for the}} enzyme-mediated formation of oxalate. In one pathway, <b>oxaloacetate,</b> {{a component of the}} Krebs citric acid cycle, is hydrolyzed to oxalate and acetic acid by the enzyme oxaloacetase: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the liver}} <b>oxaloacetate</b> can be wholly or {{partially}} diverted into the gluconeogenic pathway during fasting, starvation, a low carbohydrate diet, prolonged strenuous exercise, and in uncontrolled {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus. Under these circumstances <b>oxaloacetate</b> is hydrogenated to malate which is then removed from the mitochondrion to be converted into glucose in the cytoplasm of the liver cells, from where it is released into the blood. In the liver, therefore, <b>oxaloacetate</b> is unavailable for condensation with acetyl-CoA when significant gluconeogenesis has been stimulated by low (or absent) insulin and high glucagon concentrations in the blood. Under these circumstances acetyl-CoA is diverted {{to the formation of}} acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Acetoacetate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and their spontaneous breakdown product, acetone, are frequently, but confusingly, known as ketone bodies (as they are not [...] "bodies" [...] at all, but water-soluble chemical substances). The ketone bodies are released by the liver into the blood. All cells with mitochondria can take ketone bodies up from the blood and reconvert them into acetyl-CoA, which can then be used as fuel in their citric acid cycles, as no other tissue can divert its <b>oxaloacetate</b> into the gluconeogenic pathway in the way that this can occur in the liver. Unlike free fatty acids, ketone bodies can cross the blood-brain barrier and are therefore available as fuel for the cells of the central nervous system, acting as a substitute for glucose, on which these cells normally survive. The occurrence of high levels of ketone bodies in the blood during starvation, a low carbohydrate diet, prolonged heavy exercise and uncontrolled type 1 diabetes mellitus is known as ketosis, and, in its extreme form, in out-of-control type 1 diabetes mellitus, as ketoacidosis.|$|E
2500|$|Firstly, the [...] NADH + H+ {{generated}} by glycolysis {{has to be}} transferred to the mitochondrion to be oxidized, and thus to regenerate the NAD+ necessary for glycolysis to continue. However the inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to NADH and NAD+. [...] Use is therefore made of two “shuttles” to transport the electrons from NADH across the mitochondrial membrane. They are the malate-aspartate shuttle and the glycerol phosphate shuttle. In the former the electrons from NADH are transferred to cytosolic <b>oxaloacetate</b> to form malate. The malate then traverses the inner mitochondrial membrane into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is reoxidized by NAD+ forming intra-mitochondrial <b>oxaloacetate</b> and NADH. The <b>oxaloacetate</b> is then re-cycled to the cytosol via its conversion to aspartate which is readily transported out of the mitochondrion. In the glycerol phosphate shuttle electrons from cytosolic NADH are transferred to dihydroxyacetone to form glycerol-3-phosphate which readily traverses the outer mitochondrial membrane. Glycerol-3-phosphate is then reoxidized to dihydroxyacetone, donating its electrons to FAD instead of NAD+. This reaction takes place on the inner mitochondrial membrane, allowing FADH2 to donate its electrons directly to coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) {{which is part of the}} electron transport chain which ultimately transfers electrons to molecular oxygen (O2), with the formation of water, and the release of energy eventually captured in the form of ATP.|$|E

[...] The decarboxylation reactions occur before malate is formed in the cycle. This is the only substance that can be removed from the mitochondrion to enter the gluconeogenic pathway to form glucose or glycogen in the liver or any other tissue. There can therefore be no net conversion of fatty acids into glucose.|$|E
2500|$|Citrate can {{be transported}} {{out of the}} {{mitochondria}} and into the cytoplasm, then broken down into acetyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis and into <b>oxaloacetate.</b> Citrate is a positive modulator of this conversion, and allosterically regulates the enzyme acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which is the regulating enzyme in the conversion of acetyl-CoA into malonyl-CoA (the commitment step in fatty acid synthesis). [...] In short, citrate is transported to the cytoplasm, converted to acetyl CoA, which is converted into malonyl CoA by the acetyl CoA carboxylase, which is allosterically modulated by citrate.|$|E
2500|$|Beta oxidation, in the {{mitochondrial}} matrix, then {{cuts the}} long carbon chains of the fatty acids (in {{the form of}} acyl-CoA molecules) {{into a series of}} two-carbon (acetate) units, which, combined with co-enzyme A, form molecules of acetyl CoA, which condense with <b>oxaloacetate</b> to form citrate at the [...] "beginning" [...] of the citric acid cycle. [...] It is convenient to think of this reaction as marking the [...] "starting point" [...] of the cycle, as this is when fuel - acetyl-CoA - is added to the cycle, which will be dissipated as CO2 and H2O with the release of a substantial quantity of energy captured in the form of ATP, during the course of each turn of the cycle.|$|E
2500|$|When glucose {{has been}} {{converted}} into G6P by hexokinase or glucokinase, it can either be converted to glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) for conversion to glycogen, or it is alternatively converted by glycolysis to pyruvate, which enters the mitochondrion where it is converted into acetyl-CoA and then into citrate. Excess citrate is exported from the mitochondrion back into to the cytosol, where ATP citrate lyase regenerates acetyl-CoA and <b>oxaloacetate</b> (OAA). The acetyl-CoA is then used for fatty acid synthesis and cholesterol synthesis, two important ways of utilizing excess glucose when its concentration is high in blood. The rate limiting enzymes catalyzing these reactions perform these functions when they have been dephosphorylated through the action of insulin on the liver cells. [...] Between meals, during fasting, exercise or hypoglycemia, glucagon and epinephrine are released into the blood. This causes liver glycogen to be converted back to G6P, and then converted to glucose by the liver-specific enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase and released into the blood. Glucagon and epinephrine also stimulate gluconeogenesis, which coverts non-carbohydrate substrates into G6P, which joins the G6P derived from glycogen, or substitutes for it when the liver glycogen store have been depleted. This is critical for brain function, since the brain utilizes glucose as an energy source under most conditions. The simultaneously phosphorylation of, particularly, phosphofructokinase, but also, {{to a certain extent}} pyruvate kinase, prevents glycolysis occurring {{at the same time as}} gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Oxaloacetate</b> decarboxylase is a carboxy-lyase {{involved}} in the conversion of <b>oxaloacetate</b> into pyruvate.|$|E

Once in the cytosol, the malate is oxidized back to <b>oxaloacetate</b> by cytosolic malate dehydrogenase. Finally, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) converts <b>oxaloacetate</b> to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).|$|E
50|$|Asparagine usually {{enters the}} citric acid cycle in humans as <b>oxaloacetate.</b> In bacteria, the {{degradation}} of asparagine leads {{to the production of}} <b>oxaloacetate</b> which is the molecule which combines with citrate in the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle).
