5|$|Despite Marx's {{stress on}} {{critique}} {{of capitalism and}} discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, {{as he saw it}} as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal). Marx also never clearly discusses issues <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> <b>and</b> justice, although scholars agree that his work contained implicit discussion of those concepts.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} also imposes {{restrictions on}} these rights. The government restricts these freedoms {{in the interest}} of the independence, sovereignty and integrity of India.

The six freedoms are also automatically suspended or have restrictions imposed on them during a state of emergency.|$|E
5|$|The {{portrayal}} of nudes was officially discouraged in 17th-century Spain.

However, within intellectual and aristocratic circles, the aims of art were believed to supersede questions <b>of</b> <b>morality,</b> <b>and</b> there were many, generally mythological, nudes in private collections.|$|E

40|$|THE THEME OF MORALITIES AND DEPRAVITIES IN RENAISSANCE DECORATION OF SGRAFFITOS IN THE CZECH AND MORAVIA ARCHITECTURE The {{thesis is}} focused on {{decoration}} of fronts in the renaissance architecture, there is special consideration to the theme <b>of</b> <b>moralities</b> <b>and</b> depravities and their iconography. Firstly, the theme is in general. There is decribed the sgraffitos technique and it's previous phases in Italy. Hereinafter, there is charakterised the slow perforation to our teritory with the oldest examples and later on with other pieces, and also the splitting of sgraffitos in two units. Thereafter, there is mentioned the sense of humane thinking in previous period, which came to our teritory, and extended idea of the influance of humane literature in our country over the morality tendency in the society. Those chapters are very important base to {{understand the meaning of}} popularity of the theme <b>of</b> <b>moralities</b> <b>and</b> depravities in illustrations at that time. Furthermore, there is underlined the signification of the graphic masters for creating sgraffitos decoration of fronts, there are also mentioned the most used themes, that were taken over the sgraffitos later on. After that follows the elaboration about iconography, mainly personification <b>of</b> <b>moralities</b> <b>and</b> depravities from their first illustration till the period [...] ...|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} philosophers, {{including}} Elizabeth Anscombe , Jean Bethke Elshtain , Servais Pinckaers, Iris Murdoch, and the Catholic Encyclopedia, have all {{suggested that the}} Kantian conception of ethics rooted in autonomy is contradictory in its dual contention that humans are co-legislators <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> <b>and</b> that morality is a priori. They argue that if something is universally a priori (i.e., existing unchangingly prior to experience), then it cannot also be in part dependent upon humans, who have not always existed. On the other hand, if humans truly do legislate morality, then they are not bound by it objectively, because they are always free to change it.|$|E
5|$|Chapter seven {{deals with}} conceptions <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> <b>and</b> ethics, arguing that whereas High Magic {{typically}} envisions a dualistic world view of good versus evil, Wicca adheres to a monistic worldview in which malevolence and benevolence {{are seen as}} intrinsic parts of the whole. Disagreeing with Luhrmann's view that morality's place in the occult is to hide the pseudo-scientific nature of magic, Greenwood discusses how magic and witchcraft developed in Europe {{as a part of}} moral discourse. She looks at the internal source of morality in High Magic, explaining concepts such as that of the Qliphoth, before examining the internal source of morality in Wicca and Feminist Witchcraft.|$|E
5|$|Love in Several Masques was Fielding's first play, and {{was first}} {{released}} on 16 February 1728. Though {{the play was}} never revived and only ran for four nights, it still did moderately well especially {{when compared with the}} competing plays at that time. In the play, three respectable males each meet a female counterpart three times, and share a parallel incident with letters and an unmasking. Fielding focuses on men and how he believes they should prove their worth before marriage. It also highlights Fielding's belief in the relationship <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> <b>and</b> libertine beliefs and introduces character types that Fielding would use throughout his plays and novels.|$|E

5|$|The {{argument}} from morality {{is an argument}} {{for the existence of}} God. Arguments from morality tend to be based on moral normativity or moral order. Arguments from moral normativity observe some aspect <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> <b>and</b> argue that God is the best or only explanation for this, concluding that God must exist. Arguments from moral order are based on the asserted need for moral order to exist in the universe. They claim that, for this moral order to exist, God must exist to support it. The {{argument from}} morality is noteworthy in that one cannot evaluate the soundness of the argument without attending to almost every important philosophical issue in meta-ethics.|$|E

5|$|While Hawks was not {{sympathetic}} to feminism, he popularized the Hawksian woman archetype, a portrayal {{of women in}} more strong, less effeminate roles. Such an emphasis had never {{been done in the}} 1920s and therefore was seen to be a rarity and, according to Naomi Wise, has been cited as a prototype of the post-feminist movement. Another notable theme carried throughout his work included the relationship <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> <b>and</b> human interaction. In this sense he tended to portray more dramatic elements of a concept or a plot in a humorous way.|$|E
5|$|Studio Ghibli {{released}} {{an adaptation of}} the series in 2006 titled Tales from Earthsea. The film very loosely combines elements of the first, third, and fourth books into a new story. Le Guin commented with displeasure on the film-making process, saying that she had acquiesced to the adaptation believing Hayao Miyazaki would be producing the film himself, which was eventually not the case. Le Guin praised the imagery of the film, but disliked the use of violence. She also expressed dissatisfaction with the portrayal <b>of</b> <b>morality,</b> <b>and</b> in particular {{the use of a}} villain who could be slain as a means of resolving conflict, which she said was antithetical to the message of the book. The film received generally mixed responses.|$|E
5|$|The reason no {{successful}} rescue {{was ever}} effected {{lies in the}} remoteness of the Hebrides from the anglophone world in the early 18th century. No reliable naval charts of the area became available until 1776. Without local assistance and knowledge, finding a captive in this wilderness would have required a significant expeditionary force. Nonetheless, the lack of action taken by Edinburgh society in general and her children in particular to retrieve {{one of their own}} is remarkable. The Kirk hierarchy, for example, made no attempt to contact her or convey news of her condition to the capital, yet they could easily have done so. Whatever the call <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> <b>and</b> natural justice may have suggested, John Chiesley's daughter evidently did not command a sympathetic audience in her home town.|$|E

5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society would be fair. To achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents <b>of</b> <b>morality</b> <b>and</b> entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the shared ability of humans to reason should be the basis <b>of</b> <b>morality,</b> <b>and</b> {{that it is the}} ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, {{believed that}} all humans {{should have the right to}} common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even if they were the patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests on patients without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient, so they must be informed of all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.|$|E
