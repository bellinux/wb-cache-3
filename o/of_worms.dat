5|$|Internal parasites of {{the common}} loon include many species <b>of</b> <b>worms,</b> {{including}} flatworms, tapeworms, nematodes and spiny-headed worms. High levels <b>of</b> <b>worms</b> may result from feeding changes due to low availability of fish, {{and can lead to}} illness and death. Protozoal infections including one caused by Eimeria gaviae and avian malaria has been recorded in this loon. The black fly Simulium annulus is closely associated with the common loon to which it is attracted to chemicals in the uropygial gland secretions as well as by visual and tactile cues. This fly is detrimental to loons, their preferred hosts, transmitting blood-borne parasites and viruses, and causing nest abandonment when numbers are high. External parasites include ischnoceran feather lice, although these are not found on the bird's head.|$|E
5|$|The PC version <b>of</b> <b>Worms</b> Armageddon was {{critically}} successful. Whilst {{writing that}} veterans <b>of</b> <b>Worms</b> 2 {{would find the}} game to be similar, Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the game for being easy to play and control and humorous and the game's graphics, physics, and seemingly endless customization {{as well as the}} game's WormNet. He also likened the single-player missions to the classic game of Lemmings in that the missions often required the player to precisely utilize a limited supply of weapons and tools to accomplish the objective. Among his only criticisms are that the AI-controlled worms do not utilize their full arsenals and that the player would wish that there were more weapons, more diverse graphics and sound, and more content. Matthew Pierce of PC Gamer UK commended Team17 for addressing the problems of single-player (i.e. the missions and AI) that the original Worms and Worms 2 had always been criticized for.|$|E
40|$|Number of {{conventional}} methods {{are available for}} solving different types of optimization problems. But due to their complexity and convergence problems these methods {{are not able to}} give optimal solution.

A Gear design require the designer to compromise many design variables; i. e. continuous, discrete & integer variables in order to determine best performance of gear set. Therefore researchers are now going to use Evolutionary Techniques. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is one of such technique. In this paper the attempt has been made to optimize worm and worm wheel with multiple objectives, which takes gear ratio (i), face width <b>of</b> <b>worm</b> & worm wheel (b) and pitch circle diameters <b>of</b> <b>worm</b> (dw) & worm wheel (dg) as design variables.

Naturally, composting to obtain organic fertilizer from cowdung and market waste need a long time. Vermicomposting is a technique to make compost of biodegradable waste become fertilizer with high quality by earth-worm such as Lumbricus Rubellus. This process need 8 week, but with vermicomposting only need a half time. This mechanism was happened because worm assisted to eat cellulose of cowdung which cannot decomposed by composting bacterium.

5|$|One of the undeniable {{aspects of}} that {{division}} {{is that the}} Anacletans were mainly older cardinals, veterans of the investiture controversy, created either by Paschalis II or early in the pontificate of Callixtus II, while Innocentine cardinals with few exceptions were created after Concordat <b>of</b> <b>Worms</b> (1122), which established peace with the Emperor. Out of nineteen cardinals created before 1122, only five supported the Chancellor, while out of twenty four appointed from that time onwards as many as fourteen. The other possible reasons for such radical tensions in the College (e.g. national divisions, connections to different spiritual centres) are widely discussed by historians without final conclusion.|$|E

Her husband was occupied in finding a compromise with the Pope, who had excommunicated him. In 1122, Henry and probably Matilda were at the Council <b>of</b> <b>Worms.</b> The council settled the long-running dispute with the Church when Henry gave up his rights to invest bishops with their episcopal regalia. Matilda attempted to visit her father in England that year, but the journey was blocked by Charles I, Count of Flanders, whose territory she would have needed to pass through. Historian Marjorie Chibnall argues Matilda had intended to discuss the inheritance of the English crown on this journey.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Worm gear {{is usually}} made of bronze, {{which is a}} {{precious}} and nonferrous metal. In order to substitute for the bronze, {{a new kind of}} antifriction composite material of polymer-matrix, ZW- 1 material has been successfully developed. Compared with <b>worm</b> gear made <b>of</b> bronze, <b>worm</b> gear made <b>of</b> ZW- 1 material has made worm gear transmission possess many advantageous properties. In order to bring the excellent properties <b>of</b> <b>worm</b> gear transmission <b>of</b> ZW- 1 material into play and substitute for bronze, the test for anti-fracture capacity <b>of</b> <b>worm</b> gear made <b>of</b> ZW- 1 material under static load has been made. A simple test-bed is designed. The test has been carried out under static load. The test <b>of</b> <b>worm</b> gear with ZW- 1 and nylon materials, different teeth numbers、tooth width and tooth forms is made. The test findings show that in the test conditions the invalidation <b>of</b> ZW- 1 <b>worm</b> gear is radial fracture in gear rim. Applying stress transmission theory and micrographic analysis, fracture mechanism of ZW- 1 material is found out, namely degumming on the interface between fiber and polymer. Anti-fracture capacity <b>of</b> <b>worm</b> gear <b>of</b> ZW- 1 material is twenty three times as much as that <b>of</b> bronze <b>worm</b> gear(Q/ZB 125 - 73). Archimedes worm gear has the same anti-fracture capacity as arc tooth <b>worm</b> gear <b>of</b> ZW- 1 material. Macrographic analysis shows that load concentration and contact stress concentration of bolt hole caused by bending bolt are significant factors which affect invalidation <b>of</b> <b>worm</b> gear. The test result shows an important fact that overlapping coefficient <b>of</b> <b>worm</b> gear transmission <b>of</b> ZW- 1 material worm gear is much higher than that of calculating in theory, for small modulo of elasticity has a good effect upon the <b>worm</b> gear transmission <b>of</b> ZW- 1 <b>worm</b> gear...|$|R
