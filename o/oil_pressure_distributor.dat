5000|$|Tucker {{initially}} {{tried to}} develop an innovative engine, with help from Ben Parsons, then owner {{and president of the}} Fuelcharger Corporation, and would later be Tucker's VP of engineering. It was a [...] flat-6 cylinder with hemispherical combustion chambers, fuel injection, and overhead valves operated by oil pressure rather than a camshaft. An <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>distributor</b> was mounted in line with the ignition distributor and delivered appropriately timed direct oil pressure to open each valve at proper intervals. The oil pressure fed to each valve was [...] "timed" [...] by intake and exhaust eccentrics and measured by spring-loaded plungers. It had large pistons built of aluminum and magnesium castings with steel-plated cylinder linings. This unique engine was designed to idle at 100 rpm and cruise at 250-1200 rpm through the use of direct-drive torque converters on each driving wheel instead of a transmission. It was designed to produce almost 1 and [...] of torque at only 1800 RPM. When cruising at 60 mph, it would only turn at approximately 1000 rpm. [...] These features would have been auto industry firsts in 1948, but as engine development proceeded, problems appeared. Six prototypes of the 589 engine were built, but it was installed only in the test chassis and the first prototype.|$|E
50|$|The <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is {{monitored}} by an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> sending unit, usually mounted to the block of the engine. This {{can either be}} a spring-loaded pressure sensor or an electronic pressure sensor, {{depending on the type}} of sending unit. Problems with the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> sending unit or the connections between it and the driver's display can cause abnormal <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> readings when <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is perfectly acceptable.|$|R
50|$|Some vehicle engines have an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> {{switch that}} {{switches}} a warning light on at low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> Some vehicles have an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> gauge in the dashboard or instrument cluster.|$|R
40|$|The {{basis of}} {{the design of the}} oil system of a H. V. oil filled cable circuit is {{considered}} in particular the choice of oil feed locations along the cable route. Methods are established for determining the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> tank requirements and the <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> response on application of step or pulse loads for typical oil sections of a single core H. V. oil filled cable circuit. These methods are applied to an existing 132 KV installation and minimum <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> tankage requirements and the maximum and minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressures</b> considering various loading conditions determined. To establish the minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> the <b>oil</b> <b>pressures</b> occurring on switching off various continuous loads are compared to that occurring on switching off load shortly after having switched on. Recommendations are made for similar circuits based on the loading condition giving the minimum transient <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> Possible ways of verifying the theoretical methods and en electrical analogue of the oil system are considered...|$|R
50|$|<b>Oil</b> <b>pressure</b> {{is higher}} when {{the engine is}} cold due to the {{increased}} viscosity of the oil, and also increases with engine speed until the relief valve in the oil pump opens to divert excess flow. <b>Oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is lowest under hot idling conditions, and the minimum pressure allowed by the manufacturer's tolerances is usually given at this point. Excessive <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> may indicate a blocked filter, blocked oil gallery or the wrong grade of <b>oil.</b> Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> indicates worn bearings or a broken oil pump.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{control of}} <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> of wet-clutch {{is of great}} {{importance}} for improving shift quality. Based on dynamic models of two-gear planetary transmission and hydraulic control system, a trajectory tracking model of <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> was built by sliding mode control method. An experiment was designed to verify the validity of hydraulic control system, through which the relationship between duty cycle of on-off valve and <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> of clutch was determined. The tracking effect was analyzed by simulation. Results showed that <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> could follow well the optimal trajectory and the shift quality was effectively improved...|$|R
5000|$|Colour {{may also}} {{communicate}} {{information about the}} nature of the tell-tale, for example red may signify that the vehicle cannot continue driving (e.g. <b>oil</b> <b>pressure).)</b> Many older vehicles used schemes which were specific to the manufacturer, e.g. some British Fords of the 1960's used green for <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> warning, while many other makes of the same era used amber for <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|R
25|$|However, {{shortly after}} 09:20am IST, {{the flight crew}} {{encountered}} {{a problem with the}} transmission <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> The pilots became engaged in finding out emergency checklist procedures for the transmission <b>oil</b> <b>pressure,</b> but were unsuccessful.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} a {{technical}} {{change in the way}} <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is regulated in the clutch, i.e. FWD switching. <b>Oil</b> <b>pressure</b> on the clutch plates is now regulated by a centrifugal valve integrated in the electric axial six piston oil pump. Compared to the previous generation, the Haldex 5 system is 1.4 kg lighter (ca. 6.6 kg without oil) and simpler as it does not contain an <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> accumulator.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> idiot light lights when engine <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> {{drops below}} a {{predetermined}} level. The light normally appears when the vehicle ignition is turned on, but {{the engine is}} not running, as it detects no <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> due to the oil pump not operating (the oil pump is powered off the crankshaft, so only operates when the engine is running). It normally turns off a few seconds after engine start as the oil pump starts working and building up <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> This tell-tale can bear the legend [...] or a pictogram of an oil can. Some cars illuminate the light red or yellow, depending on the action needed to be taken.|$|R
50|$|There {{are only}} 4 reasons for low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure.</b> 1) no <b>oil</b> or low {{oil in the}} engine 2) worn or {{defective}} oil pump or broken pressure relief valve spring 3) worn main bearings (big ends {{have nothing to do}} with <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> as most of the pressure to these are supplied by centrifugal force and 4) oil gallery fracture or blockage. Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> can cause engine damage. First thing to fail will be cam carrier bearings if vehicle is OHC as this is fed through a restrictor and low pressure will starve top of engine of lube.If pistons have crown jets eg scania,could cause piston/liner nip. Also the crankshaft and connecting rod bearings will seize. Indications of low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> may be that the warning light is on, a low pressure reading on the gauge, or clattering/clinking noises from the engine. Low <b>oil</b> <b>pressure</b> is a problem that must be addressed immediately to prevent serious damage.|$|R
