40|$|A {{thin film}} of electron-trapping {{material}} (ETM), {{when combined with}} suitable optical bistability, is considered as medium for optical implementation of bio-inspired neural nets. The optical mechanism of ETM under blue light and NIR exposure has the inherent ability at the material level to mimic the crucial components of the stylized Hodgkin-Huxley model of biological neuron. Combining this unique property with high resolution capability of ETM, a dense network of bio-inspired neurons can be realized in a thin film of this infrared stimulable storage phosphore. The work presented here, when combined with suitable optical bistability and <b>optical</b> <b>interconnectivity,</b> {{has the potential of}} producing an artificial nonlinear excitable medium analogue to cortical tissue...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} development of the communication protocol for the customized data communication switch (FloSwitch). This protocol concentrates on the serial link interface between PCI -e add-on cards and the FloSwitch in the parallel computing system. The serial link is an <b>optical</b> <b>interconnectivity</b> with a bit rate of 6. 25 Gbps in full duplex mode. The protocol receives data from the PCI-Express PCI -e) add-on cards through the optical link at the FloSwitch and does the necessary process ing on the data (example: floating point addition), and the result is transmitted through the optical link to the destinations. This task is performed according to the command field, other information available in the header and the data. This implementation is done on the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA...|$|E
