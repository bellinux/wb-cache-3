But Seurat, one feels, saw it almost as one might suppose some visitant from another planet would have done. He saw it with this penetrating exactness of a gaze vacant of all direct understanding... Each figure seems to be so perfectly enclosed within its simplified contour, for, however precise and detailed Seurat is, his passion for geometricizing never deserts him—enclosed so completely, so shut off in its partition, that no other relation than a spatial and geometrical one is any longer possible. The syntax of actual life has been broken up and replaced by Seurat's own peculiar syntax with all its strange, remote and unforeseen implications.|$|E
25|$|In June 1867 Ismail was {{declared}} khedive of Egypt, with succession {{in favor of}} his eldest son. Nubar now had a harder task to undertake than ever before. The antiquated system of capitulations which had existed in the Ottoman Empire since the 15th century had grown in Egypt to be a practical creation of seventeen imperia in imperio: seventeen consulates of seventeen different powers administered seventeen different codes in courts before which alone their subjects were amenable. A plaintiff could only sue a Frenchman in the French court, with appeal to Aix-en-Provence; an Italian in the Italian court, with appeal to Ancona; a Russian in the Russian court, with appeal to Moscow. Nubar's bold design, for which alone he deserves the credit, was to induce these seventeen powers to consent to abandon their jurisdiction in civil actions, to substitute mixed International Courts and a uniform code binding <b>on</b> <b>all.</b> <b>That</b> {{in spite of the}} jealousies of all the powers, in spite of the opposition of the Sublime Porte, he should have succeeded, places him at once in the first rank of statesmen of his period. Nubar made no attempt {{to get rid of the}} criminal jurisdiction exercised by the consular representatives of the foreign powers — such a proposal would have had, at that time, no chance of success.|$|E

It just opens up your mind to another dimension...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style—doesn't matter whether it's off Paranoid or if it's off Heaven and Hell—it's very distinctive." [...] Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian said [...] "I always get the question in every interview I do, 'What are your top five metal albums?'

According to Lowry Nelson, Jr., Sonnet 65 is simply a continuation of Sonnet 64 and he argues that [...] "both poems are meditations {{on the theme of}} time's destructiveness". He also explains that [...] "Sonnet 65 makes use of the same words [...] and more or less specific notions, but it proceeds and culminates far more impressively," [...] in comparison to Sonnet 64. The last two couplets are Shakespeare's own summary on the theme that love itself is a [...] "miracle" [...] that time nor human intervention can destroy.|$|E

[...] In particular, Patel pointed to Apple's AirPlay protocol as an example of an established competitor with many more features. TechCrunch's review of the device said, [...] "Even with a bug or two rearing its head, the Chromecast is easily worth its $35 pricetag." [...] Gizmodo gave the device a positive review, highlighting the ease of setup and sharing video. In comparing the device to competitors, the review said, [...] "Chromecast isn't Google's version of Apple TV, and it's not trying to be... But Chromecast also costs a third of what those devices do, and has plenty of potential given that its SDK is just a few days old." ...|$|E

2500|$|Xavier Thaxton, {{protagonist of}} Count Geiger's Blues: A Comedy (Tor Books, 1992), is {{the fine arts}} editor for a {{newspaper}} in the fictional Southern metropolis of Salonika (a satirical/alternate reality version of contemporary Atlanta) with a particularly low opinion of pop culture. [...] When he is accidentally exposed to illegally dumped nuclear waste, the radiation exposure turns him into a superhero (or, as Bishop has designated, a [...] "stalwart"). Analog reviewer Tom Easton writes about the novel's resolution: [...] "This is where Bishop falters. The satire he has painstakingly [...] created now teeters {{on the brink of}} farce. He quite properly makes the decision to yank it back from that brink, but then he loses the satire. [...] He becomes heavy-handed and obvious." [...] Faren Miller disagrees: [...] "The most ambitious comic books are no longer merely comic – may even incorporate tragedy in a critique of modern life as savage and acute, in its way, as the ferocious satire of Dante's Inferno. Count Geiger's Blues also goes beyond humor – well beyond, in its remarkable closing chapters. [...] But they build <b>on</b> <b>all</b> <b>that</b> has gone before. In unleashing a startling talent for comedy and a wide-ranging knowledge of pop culture in both its absurdity and its splendor, Michael Bishop has written his best book yet." [...] John Kessel writes [...] "Comedy is certainly a new tone from Bishop, and he demonstrates a talent for it…But it seems to me Bishop doesn't really want to write comedy. It's as if Bishop is running riffs on whatever wacky ideas come to hand, without much plan, holding his characters at arm's length; as if, trying to avoid sententiousness, he has to avoid caring – but in the end can't. The result being a loose, baggy sort of book." ...|$|E
