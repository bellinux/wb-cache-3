With assistance from Nintendo, Iwata helped turn the company around from its ¥1.5billion debt and stabilize its finances within six years.

After the clean-up effort put into these programs for Y2K, a 2003 survey found that many remained in use.|$|E

In the wake of the conference, Oppenheimer saw that while they had {{come to grips with the}} physics, considerable work was still required on the engineering, chemistry, metallurgy and ordnance aspects of building an atomic bomb. He became convinced that bomb design would require an environment where people could freely discuss problems and thereby reduce wasteful duplication <b>of</b> <b>effort.</b> He reasoned that this could best be reconciled with security by creating a central laboratory in an isolated location.|$|E

5|$|Scherger {{served as}} Officer Commanding No.2 Training Group at RAAF Station Wagga from July 1943 {{until he was}} {{appointed}} AOC of the newly formed No.10 Operational Group (No.10 OG) in November. The Air Force's main mobile strike force, No.10 OG at its formation consisted of No.77 Wing, operating A-31 Vengeance dive bombers, and No.78 Wing, operating P-40 Kittyhawk fighters, as well as various ancillary units. Promoted to acting air commodore in January 1944, Scherger established his headquarters at Nadzab, Papua New Guinea, {{in support of the}} US Fifth Air Force. Though able to launch No.78 Wing's first mission that same month, he had to deal with several organisational problems to bring all his squadrons to combat readiness, including lack of training in tropical conditions, and shortcomings in aircraft maintenance and staff rotation that resulted in the RAAF's operational rate <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> being inferior to similar USAAF formations. These issues were overcome later in the year and No.10 OG units began exceeding the rate <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> of their American counterparts.|$|E

Its rate <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> increased in May, when it conducted missions against harbors and other choke points around Honshu and Kyushu.

5|$|The Army and Air Force {{had been}} {{involved}} in interservice fighting over missile systems since they split in 1947. The Army considered surface-to-surface missiles (SSM) an extension of conventional artillery, and surface-to-air designs as the modern replacement for their anti-aircraft artillery. The Air Force considered the nuclear SSM to be an extension of their strategic bombing role, and any sort of long-range anti-aircraft system to be their domain as it would integrate with their fighter fleet. Both forces were developing missiles for both roles, leading to considerable duplication <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> which was widely seen as wasteful.|$|E

The first major amphibious operation undertaken by the Australian Army since the failed Gallipoli Campaign, the Australians invested a significant amount <b>of</b> <b>effort</b> into planning the operation.|$|E

When the game released in the West, it retained its Japanese voicetrack to preserve its atmosphere. It released to moderate sales and positive reviews. The Vita port, released in the West as Muramasa Rebirth, released to strong sales and similar reception to its original version.|$|E
5|$|The most {{successful}} Soviet spy was Klaus Fuchs, {{a member of}} the British Mission who played an important part at Los Alamos. The 1950 revelation of his espionage activities damaged the United States' nuclear cooperation with Britain and Canada. Subsequently, other instances of espionage were uncovered, leading to the arrest of Harry Gold, David Greenglass, and Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. Other spies like George Koval and Theodore Hall remained unknown for decades. The value of the espionage is difficult to quantify, as the principal constraint on the Soviet atomic bomb project was a shortage of uranium ore. The consensus is that espionage saved the Soviets one or two years <b>of</b> <b>effort.</b>|$|E
