5|$|The routing of VT17 varies greatly on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of the Bristol town center. West of Bristol, {{the route}} passes through {{generally}} level terrain and connects multiple communities. East of Bristol, VT17 is more mountainous and more rural in nature.|$|E
5|$|To {{expand the}} blast radius for {{ammunitions}} testing at Fort Custer, MDOT rerouted the BL I-94/M-37 to {{run along the}} southern and eastern edges of the airport in Battle Creek instead of following roads on the <b>opposite</b> <b>sides.</b> This change was completed in 2015.|$|E
5|$|A ship {{received}} {{by a pair}} of induction coils hung on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of the ship, and fed through an amplifier into a headset (see diagram, below). By switching between coils, the relative strength of the signal on each side could be compared. The ship maintained a course parallel to the cable by maneuvering to keep the signal strength constant.|$|E

5|$|The Texas Tornado {{held the}} Intercontinental Championship {{for almost three}} months before {{dropping}} it back to Perfect on November 19. The match was aired on the December 15 edition of WWF Superstars. The two men were also on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> for an elimination match at Survivor Series. Perfect eliminated the Tornado with a PerfectPlex, but the Tornado's team won the match. Brutus Beefcake did not wrestle again until 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{arrival of}} the French in the south {{threatened}} existing trade links that Carolina colonists had established into the interior, creating tension among all three powers. France and Spain, allies in this conflict, had been on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of the recently ended Nine Years' War. Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the Savannah River were overlaid by animosity over religious divisions between the Roman Catholic Spanish and the Protestant English along the coast.|$|E
5|$|The four {{pictures}} depict {{scenes of}} daily life in various locations in London as the day progresses. Morning shows a prudish spinster making her way to church in Covent Garden past the revellers of the previous night; Noon shows two cultures on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of the street in St Giles; Evening depicts a dyer's family returning hot and bothered {{from a trip to}} Sadler's Wells; and Night shows disreputable goings-on around a drunken freemason staggering home near Charing Cross.|$|E

40|$|The {{detection}} of surface breaking cracks at the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of a plate is of practical interest when the <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> {{of the plate}} is inaccessible. Ultrasonic techniques using a single PZT transducer {{have been used to}} detect and characterize <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> surface breaking cracks [1]. By considering the effects of curved surfaces, the technique using a single transducer has been employed to inspect pipes and boiling water reactors for cracks located on their inner walls [2]...|$|R
5|$|These ore bodies {{formed in}} {{different}} places along a ring fault in the caldera. About 50 million years after they were deposited, the tectonic plate of which they were a part collided with another small plate {{and then with the}} proto-North American continent. The collisions, which welded the plates to the continent, folded the Cleopatra tuff {{in such a way that}} the two ore bodies ended up on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of a fold called the Jerome anticline.|$|E
5|$|A {{pendulum}} hangs straight downwards in a symmetrical gravitational field. However, if {{a sufficiently}} large mass {{such as a}} mountain is nearby, its gravitational attraction should pull the pendulum's plumb-bob slightly out of true. The change in plumb-line angle against a known objectsuch as a starcould be carefully measured on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of the mountain. If {{the mass of the}} mountain could be independently established from a determination of its volume and an estimate of the mean density of its rocks, then these values could be extrapolated to provide the mean density of the Earth, and by extension, its mass.|$|E
5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows {{from the fact that}} this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E

5|$|As one road, NY14 and NY414 travel down Franklin Street, {{the main}} {{thoroughfare}} of Watkins Glen. The routes pass by several blocks of homes as {{they follow the}} western base of the ravine and meet {{the east end of}} NY329, which ascends the side of the valley to serve Watkins Glen State Park. NY414 continues to follow NY14 to Watkins Glen's central business district, where NY414 splits from the overlap to travel east at an intersection that also acts as the eastern terminus of NY409. From this point north, NY14 and NY414 follow <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of Seneca Lake, with NY414 running along the east lake shore.|$|E
5|$|Because a Leslie speaker modifies {{as well as}} amplifies the sound, {{the output}} cannot simply be {{connected}} to a larger PA system if the volume onstage from the built-in amplifier is too quiet. This is particularly problematic for an older Leslie like the 122 or 147, which only has a 40 watt RMS power amplifier. Instead, microphones are placed around the Leslie, and the output from these {{is connected to the}} PA. A typical setup for onstage miking is to use two microphones placed on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of the horn and a single microphone on the drum.|$|E
5|$|Bróðir and Óspak of Man {{were two}} Danish {{brothers}} who {{were active in}} the Isle of Man and Ireland in the 11th century. They are mentioned in the 12th century Irish Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh and the 13th century Icelandic Njal's Saga as key leaders who fought on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> in the Battle of Clontarf in 1014. The latter account names Bróðir as the killer of Brian Boru, the High King of Ireland. Both Boru and Bróðir died in the battle, although accounts differ as to who killed whom. Óspak fought {{on the side of}} Boru, was injured, and lost his two sons in the battle.|$|E

5|$|De Lacy {{witnessed}} charters of the Empress in 1141. During {{the later}} 1140s, de Lacy {{was able to}} recover many of his father's Welsh marcher lands, {{and one of his}} efforts at Ludlow was later embroidered in the medieval romance Fouke le Fitz Waryn. He and Miles of Gloucester were claimants to many of the same lands, and during Stephen's reign were generally on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of the succession dispute. In June 1153, de Lacy was in the company of Matilda's son, Henry fitzEmpress, who became King Henry II of England in 1154.|$|E
5|$|Having {{ensured that}} {{sufficient}} tissue {{has been removed}} to allow the desired fusion of the skin, the circumciser pulls together the <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of the labia majora, ensuring that the raw edges where the skin has been removed are well approximated. The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If a needle and thread are being used, close tight sutures will be placed {{to ensure that a}} flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.|$|E
5|$|I-190 and NY 324 follow {{parallel}} routings across Grand Island, {{with both}} roads passing on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of Fantasy Island, a local amusement park, {{near the center}} of the island. At the northern edge of the island, NY324, as signed, terminates at exit20; however, officially, NY324 rejoins I-190 across the Niagara River once again via the North Grand Island Bridge. Now in Niagara Falls, Niagara County, NY324 ends at a complex interchange featuring NY384, the Niagara Scenic Parkway, and the LaSalle Expressway on the eastern bank of the river. Farther north, I-190 meets U.S. Route62 (US62) at exit22 and NY182 at exit23.|$|E

5|$|In 1851 the Florida Legislature {{voted to}} {{establish}} two seminaries {{of higher education}} on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of the Suwannee River. Francis W. Eppes and other city leaders established an all-male academy called the Florida Institute in Tallahassee as a legislative inducement to locate the West Florida Seminary in Tallahassee. The East Florida Seminary opened in Ocala in 1853, closed in 1861, and reopened in Gainesville in 1866. The East Florida Seminary is the institution to which the modern University of Florida traces its foundation.|$|E
5|$|The Continental Divide of North America runs diagonally {{through the}} southwestern {{part of the}} park.

The origins of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers are near each other but on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of the divide. As a result, the waters of the Snake River flow to the Pacific Ocean, while those of the Yellowstone find their way to the Atlantic Ocean via the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The second arc is {{the story}} of Larc and Sierra—brother and sister dragoons who serve {{different}} dragon masters and fight on <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of the same war for power. Larc serves the dragon Drakonis, who wants to kill the other three dragons so that he can rule the world. Larc blackmails the game's protagonist to help him in this quest. Sierra, a dragoon for Vadise the White Dragon, wants to stop Drakonis without hurting her brother Larc. In the end, Drakonis is defeated again and banished to the underworld, and Larc is killed.|$|E
