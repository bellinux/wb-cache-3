The break proved to be advantageous as this single returned the group to the UK top 20, peaking at number 15. The follow-up single [...] "Golden Days" [...] was released alongside their fourth studio album I Hear Talk. However again, the group saw their fortunes tumble as neither dented the top 40.

2500|$|When {{she breaks}} with German {{practice}} and asks the judge at her trial [...] "What {{would you have}} done?" [...] about whether she should have left her job at Siemens and taken the guard position, her question indicates {{that she does not}} know that she could have acted differently, and her statement that there was [...] "no alternative" [...] claims a lack of moral responsibility. As a result of her shame at being illiterate, she has not only let the bulk of the crime be pinned on her, she has let those with a greater share of responsibility escape full accountability. Franklin writes that this is the moral center of the novel—that Hanna, as Michael puts it, chooses exposure as a criminal <b>over</b> <b>exposure</b> as an illiterate—and in Franklin's view the novel cannot recover from the weakness of this position. Franklin regards it not only as implausible, but the implication that Hanna chose the job and acted as she did because of her illiteracy appears intended to exonerate her. Her Nazism was accidental, and Franklin writes that Schlink offers no guidance about how to punish a brutality of convenience, rather than of ideology.|$|E

40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{relationship}} between short-term neuroplasticity and individual differences in intelligence. Twenty-two participants completed cognitive testing and a visual EEG experiment involving exposures to repeated and novel stimuli. Time-frequency analyses of phase-locked (evoked) and non-phase-locked (induced) power showed a small effect of decreasing evoked/induced theta (4 - 8 Hz) ratios <b>over</b> stimulus <b>exposures,</b> irrespective of condition. Hypotheses that intelligence would relate {{to an increase in}} this ratio <b>over</b> <b>exposures</b> were not supported. However, the magnitude of the ratio positively correlated with intelligence; while the amount of induced gamma (30 - 50 Hz) activation pre- to post-stimulus was highly inversely related to g. Results suggest that transient changes in neural network phase strongly relate to intelligence in physiological measurements acquired over brief intervals.

40|$|Abstract Background On March 11, 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake and tsunami that {{followed}} caused severe damage along Japans northeastern coastline {{and to the}} Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. To date, there are few reports specifically examining psychological distress in rescue workers in Japan. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent concern <b>over</b> radiation <b>exposure</b> has caused psychological distress to such workers deployed in the disaster area. Methods One month after the disaster, 424 of 1816 (24 %) disaster medical assistance team workers deployed to the disaster area were assessed. Concern <b>over</b> radiation <b>exposure</b> was evaluated by a single self-reported question. General psychological distress was assessed with the Kessler 6 scale (K 6), depressive symptoms with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), fear and sense of helplessness with the Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and posttraumatic stress symptoms with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R). Results Radiation exposure was a concern for 39 (9. 2 %) respondents. Concern <b>over</b> radiation <b>exposure</b> {{was significantly associated with}} higher scores on the K 6, CES-D, PDI, and IES-R. After controlling for age, occupation, disaster operation experience, duration of time spent watching earthquake news, and past history of psychiatric illness, these associations remained significant in men, but did not remain significant in women for the CES-D and PDI scores. Conclusion The findings suggest that concern <b>over</b> radiation <b>exposure</b> was strongly associated with psychological distress. Reliable, accurate information on radiation exposure might reduce deployment-related distress in disaster rescue workers. </p...|$|R
