5|$|A {{few weeks}} after {{accepting}} the offer, Apollo is assigned to investigate three separate incidents: a hit-and-run involving Phoenix, the theft of a noodle vendor's cart, and the disappearance of Trucy's favorite pair of panties. At the same time, the Kitaki crime family hires him to defend one of their own, Wocky Kitaki, in a murder trial concerning the death of Dr. Pal Meraktis.

In his biography, Chrisye noted that he enjoyed eating at roadside foodstalls well after his marriage and would be perplexed when people stared at him. Guruh recalled that Chrisye would sleep anywhere during extended planning sessions, including under the piano.|$|E

It is revealed that out of her family, Persephone is the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> knows of Lydia's sexuality. Lydia replaces Rhys Ashworth (Andrew Moss) as the drummer of Josh's band 'The Somethings' as he kicked him out because he was against having wheelchair user Hayley Ramsey (Kelly Marie Stewart) as the lead singer because of their bad breakup.

5|$|Marcos {{initially}} {{needed to}} win votes of the delegates of the Nacionalista Party for the presidential candidacy. Imelda assumed the managerial position in her husband's campaign. The other candidates of the party noted her enthusiasm during the campaign; she met with and befriended every single delegate of the 1,347 who would {{have a say in}} the Nacionalista Party Convention. She would talk with each of them, visit them in their own homes, and attend gatherings such as birthday parties, anniversaries, and weddings. Of all the presidential candidates' wives, Imelda was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> went through a detailed and personal campaign for her husband. On November 21, 1964, Ferdinand Marcos won the presidential nomination for the Nacionalista Party.|$|E
5|$|Promoted {{to major}} on 8 June, Morshead {{distinguished}} {{himself in the}} Battle of Lone Pine on 6 August.

However, on 16 September, like many others, he succumbed to dysentery and paratyphoid fever. He was evacuated to the 3rd General Hospital on Lemnos, and then to England on the hospital ship Aquitania, where he {{was admitted to the}} 3rd London General Hospital in Wandsworth, England. For his services in the Gallipoli campaign, he was mentioned in despatches.|$|E

5|$|The passion {{she showed}} for Abigail, and the {{stubborn}} refusal to dismiss her, angered Sarah {{to the point}} that she implied that a lesbian affair was taking place between the two women. During the mourning period for Anne's husband, Sarah was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> refused to wear suitable mourning clothes. This gave the impression that she did not consider Anne's grief over his death to be genuine. Eventually, because of the mass support for peace in the War of the Spanish Succession, Anne decided she no longer needed the Duke of Marlborough and took the opportunity to dismiss him on trumped-up charges of embezzlement.|$|E

5|$|A batting all-rounder, Loxton {{played as}} a {{right-handed}} middle-order batsman and a right-arm fast medium bowler who reinforced the frontline pace attack of Lindwall, Miller and Bill Johnston. When fit, the trio all bowled before Loxton in the Tests. With medium pacer Ernie Toshack and off spinner Ian Johnson also {{playing in the}} Third and Fourth Tests, Loxton was the sixth bowler. In the Fifth Test, Johnson was replaced by leg spinner Ring and the injured Toshack {{was replaced by a}} batsman, so Loxton became the fifth bowler. Of the seven regular bowlers, Loxton was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> was not a frontline bowler, and as such he had the worst average, the second-worst economy rate and the third-worst strike rate. Loxton ended the Test series with 144 runs at 48.00 and three wickets at 49.33, having bowled 63 overs. Loxton batted at No.6 or No.7 during the Tests, and was the last batsman in the batting order before the wicket-keeper and the bowlers.|$|E
5|$|A towering {{figure in}} the Republican party of his day, Blaine fell into obscurity fairly soon after his death. A 1905 {{biography}} by his wife’s cousin, Edward Stanwood, was written when the question was still in doubt, {{but by the time}} David Saville Muzzey published his biography of Blaine in 1934, the subtitle “A Political Idol of Other Days” already spoke to its subject’s fading place in the popular mind, perhaps because of the nine men the Republican Party nominated for the Presidency from 1860 to 1912, Blaine is the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> never became President. Although several authors studied Blaine’s foreign policy career, including Edward P. Crapol’s 2000 work, Muzzey’s was the last full-scale biography of the man until Neil Rolde’s 2006 book. Historian R. Hal Williams was working on a new biography of Blaine, tentatively titled James G. Blaine: A Life in Politics, until his death in 2016.|$|E
5|$|After {{his brother}} Virgil was maimed in an ambush and Morgan was assassinated by hidden assailants, the men {{suspected}} of involvement were provided alibis by fellow Cowboys and released without trial. Wyatt {{and his brother}} Warren {{set out on a}} vendetta ride to locate and kill those they felt were responsible. Wyatt has been portrayed in a number of films and books as a fearless Western hero. He is often viewed as the central character and hero of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, at least in part because he was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> was not wounded or killed. In fact, his brother, Tombstone Marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a Union soldier in the Civil War, and in law enforcement as a sheriff, constable, and marshal. As city marshal, Virgil made the decision to disarm the Cowboys in Tombstone and requested Wyatt's assistance. But because Wyatt outlived Virgil and due to a creative biography, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal published two years after Wyatt's death, Wyatt became famous and the subject of various movies, television shows, biographies and works of fiction.|$|E

5|$|Alice in Wonderland is a 2010 American fantasy {{adventure}} film {{directed by}} Tim Burton from a screenplay written by Linda Woolverton.

Based on Lewis Carroll's fantasy novels, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. This film {{tells the story of}} a nineteen-year-old Alice Kingsleigh (stated in the film to be a daughter of Charles Kingsley), who is told that she can restore the White Queen to her throne, with the help of the Mad Hatter. She is the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> can slay the Jabberwock, a dragon-like creature that is controlled by the Red Queen and terrorizes Underland's inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|In September 2003, the NCAA {{reversed}} {{its decision}} to add a second year of postseason ineligibility after hearing an appeal by the University; the Wolverines {{went on to become}} champions of the 2004 National Invitation Tournament. Also in September 2003, Judge Edmunds deferred sentencing until she could monitor Webber's service of 300 hours of community service at a middle-school literacy program for two summers that she ordered. Also in September the University announced it sought $695,000 in restitution from Webber. Webber was the only involved athlete that the University sought restitution from in part because he was the <b>only</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> confessed to lying to a grand jury. Webber stated that he did not feel the University's request was appropriate because he had not stolen from the University.|$|E
