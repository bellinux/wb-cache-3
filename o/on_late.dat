5|$|After {{the defeat}} in Tampere, the Red Guards began a slow retreat eastwards. As the German army seized Helsinki, the White Army shifted the {{military}} focus to Viipuri; 18,500 Whites raided against 15,000 Red defending troopers. General Mannerheim's Vyborg plan {{was affected by}} the battle for Tampere, the civilian industrial town. He aimed to avoid a new bloody city combat, in Viipuri - the old border ground military fortress. The Jäger detachments tried to destroy and bind the Red force outside Viipuri, and conquer the lamed town area in a mild battle. The Whites were able to cut the Reds' connection to Petrograd and weaken the troops, in the fierce combats, in the Karelian Isthmus on 20–26 April, but the decisive blow remained in besieged Viipuri. The final attack to the city began <b>on</b> <b>late</b> 27 April with a heavy, concentrated Jäger artillery barrage. The Reds' tough defence in the street combat collapsed gradually and eventually the Whites conquered Patterinmäki - the symbolic Last Stand-hill of the Finnish Red 1918 Uprising - {{in the center of}} Viipuri, on early hours of 29 April 1918. In total 400 Whites and 500–600 Reds died and 12,000–15,000 were imprisoned.|$|E

5|$|In 1695 the French command {{found that}} the {{inhabitants}} of the areas occupied by the French army were reluctant to pay war contributions and started to oppose an organized and growingly successful resistance. During the winter of 1694-1695, the inhabitants of Calella repelled a punishment force of 800 or 1,000 French soldiers from the Blanes garrison and killed between 60 or 100 of them. French troops were also harassed by Catalan militia forces, the miquelets, who laid ambushes to Noailles' forces from woods and heights. One of the most effective leaders of the miquelets was Captain Ramon de Sala i Saçala, the veguer of Vic, who achieved two victories over the French during the winter: <b>on</b> <b>late</b> December he overran a convoy on way to Hostalric, killing 25 French soldiers and taking 25 prisoners, and on 24 February he defeated a company of French dragoons at Navata, killing 7 of them and taking 28 prisoners and 32 horses.|$|E
