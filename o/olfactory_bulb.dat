5|$|The {{olfactory}} system {{is made up}} in part of the RMS which stretches from the subventricular zone in {{the wall of the}} lateral ventricle, through the basal forebrain, to the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb</b> (OB). VONS is the name given to this pathway, and it consists of the subventricular zone, the RMS, the olfactory tract and the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb.</b> Developing neurons leave the subventricular zone and enter the RMS and travel caudally and ventrally along the undersurface of the caudate nucleus; this {{is referred to as the}} descending limb. Upon reaching the ventral side of the caudate nucleus, the neurons follow the rostral limb and travel ventrally and rostrally, entering the anterior olfactory cortex (AOC). The AOC gives rise to the olfactory tract, which ends in the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once the {{developing}} neurons reach {{the core of}} the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb,</b> they detach from the RMS, which is initiated by Reelin and tenascin and move radially toward glomeruli, this migration is dependent on tenascin-R, and differentiate into subtypes of interneurons. These neurons have been studied in vivo via electrophysiology and confocal imaging.|$|E
5|$|The <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb</b> is {{a special}} {{structure}} that processes olfactory sensory signals and sends its output to the olfactory part of the pallium. It is a major brain component in many vertebrates, but is greatly reduced in humans and other primates (whose senses are dominated by information acquired by sight rather than smell).|$|E
40|$|Parallel to the {{olfactory}} system, most mammals {{possess an}} accessory olfactory or vomeronasal system. The olfactory and vomeronasal epithelia project {{to the main}} and accessory <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs,</b> which in turn project to adjacent areas of the telencephalon, respectively. New data indicate that projections arising from the main and accessory <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs</b> partially converge in the rostral telencephalon and are non-overlapping at caudal telencephalic levels. Therefore, the basal telencephalon should be reclassified in olfactory, vomeronasal and mixed areas. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that virtually all olfactory- and vomeronasal-recipient structures send reciprocal projections to the main and accessory <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs,</b> respectively. Further, non-chemosensory recipient structures also projects centrifugally to the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs.</b> These feed-back projections appear to be essential modulating processing of chemosensory information. The present work aims at characterizing centrifugal projections to the main and accessory <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs</b> arising from <b>olfactory,</b> vomeronasal, mixed and non-chemosensory recipient telencephalic areas. This issue has been addressed by using tracer injections in the rat and mouse brain. Tracer injections were delivered into the main and accessory <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs</b> {{as well as in}} olfactory, vomeronasal, mixed and non-chemosensory recipient telencephalic structures. The results confirm that olfactory- and vomeronasal-recipient structures project to the main and accessory <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs,</b> respectively. Interestingly, <b>olfactory</b> (e. g., piriform cortex), vomeronasal (e. g., posteromedial cortical amygdala), mixed (e. g., the medial amygdala) and non-chemosensory-recipient (e. g., the nucleus of the diagonal band) structures project to the main and to the accessory <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs</b> thus providing the possibility of simultaneous modulation and interaction of both systems at different stages of chemosensory processing...|$|R
40|$|A {{mouse model}} of Sendai virus {{infection}} was adopted {{to examine the}} in vivo neurovirulence of parainfluenza viruses.

Viral proteins were histochemically detected in some olfactory neurons for 7 days p. i. They were also found in glomeruli of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs</b> {{but not in the}} mitral cells and the tufted cells.

5|$|The {{sense of}} smell is {{generated}} by receptor cells in the epithelium of the olfactory mucosa in the nasal cavity. This information passes through a relatively permeable part of the skull to the olfactory nerve. This nerve transmits to the neural circuitry of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb</b> from where information is passed to the olfactory cortex.|$|E
5|$|The strepsirrhine rhinarium {{can collect}} {{relatively}} non-volatile, fluid-based chemicals (traditionally categorized as pheromones) and transmit {{them to the}} vomeronasal organ (VNO), which is located below {{and in front of}} the nasal cavity, above the mouth. The VNO is an encased duct-like structure made of cartilage and is isolated from the air passing through the nasal cavity. The VNO is connected to the mouth through nasopalatine ducts (which communicate via the incisive foramen), which pass through the hard palate at the top, front of the mouth. Fluids traveling from the rhinarium to the mouth and then up the nasopalatine ducts to the VNO are detected, and information is relayed to the accessory <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb,</b> which is relatively large in strepsirrhines. From the accessory <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb,</b> information is sent to the amygdala, which handles emotions, and then to the hypothalamus, which handles basic body functions and metabolic processes. This neural pathway differs from that used by the main olfactory system.|$|E
5|$|The {{ventral tegmental area}} (VTA) {{is another}} {{midbrain}} area. The most prominent group of VTA dopaminergic neurons projects to the prefrontal cortex via the mesocortical pathway and another smaller group projects to the nucleus accumbens via the mesolimbic pathway. Together, these two pathways are collectively termed the mesocorticolimbic projection. The VTA also sends dopaminergic projections to the amygdala, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb.</b> Mesocorticolimbic neurons {{play a central role}} in reward and other aspects of motivation.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{function}} in a nocturnal and ground-dwelling niche requires {{a unique set of}} sensory specializations. The New Zealand kiwi has shifted away from vision, instead relying on auditory and tactile stimuli to function in its environment and locate prey. Behavioral evidence suggests that kiwi also rely on their sense of smell, using olfactory cues in foraging and possibly also in communication and social interactions. Anatomical studies appear to support these observations: the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs</b> and tubercles have been suggested to be large in the kiwi relative to other birds, although the extent of this enlargement is poorly understood. In this study, we examine the size of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs</b> in kiwi and compare them with 55 other bird species, including emus, ostriches, rheas, tinamous, and 2 extinct species of moa (Dinornithiformes). We also examine the cytoarchitecture of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs</b> and <b>olfactory</b> epithelium to determine if any neural specializations beyond size are present that would increase olfactory acuity. Kiwi were a clear outlier in our analysis, with <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs</b> that are proportionately larger than those of any other bird in this study. Emus, close relatives of the kiwi, also had a relative enlargement of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs,</b> possibly supporting a phylogenetic link to well-developed olfaction. The <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs</b> in kiwi are almost in direct contact with the olfactory epithelium, which is indeed well developed and complex, with olfactory receptor cells occupying {{a large percentage of the}} epithelium. The anatomy of the kiwi olfactory system supports an enhancement for olfactory sensitivities, which is undoubtedly associated with their unique nocturnal niche...|$|R
5|$|Baleen whales have a small, yet functional, vomeronasal organ. This allows baleen whales {{to detect}} {{chemicals}} and pheromones released by their prey. It {{is thought that}} 'tasting' the water is important for finding prey and tracking down other whales. They {{are believed to have}} an impaired sense of smell {{due to the lack of}} the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb,</b> but they do have an olfactory tract. Baleen whales have few if any taste buds, suggesting they have lost their sense of taste. They do retain salt-receptor taste-buds suggesting that they can taste saltiness.|$|E
5|$|The {{large size}} of the {{olfactory}} bulbs, {{as well as the}} terminal and olfactory nerves, suggest that Tarbosaurus had a keen sense of smell, as was also the case with Tyrannosaurus. The vomeronasal bulb is large and differentiated from the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb,</b> which was initially suggested as being indicative of a well-developed Jacobsen's organ, which was used to detect pheromones. This may imply that Tarbosaurus had complex mating behavior. However, the identification of the vomeronasal bulb has been challenged by other researchers, since they are not present in any living archosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Developing neurons travel {{toward the}} <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb</b> along the RMS via glial tubes, which mark the {{division}} between the differentiated nervous tissue and the tissue with embryonic characteristics. Uniquely, the cells travel tangential to the brain surface, parallel to the pial surfaces rather than radially like most developing neurons. Neurons that migrate tangentially are typically believed to migrate independently of radial glia but in the RMS researchers believe {{this is not the}} case. Adult rat glial tubes have been observed via light and electron microscopy and described as a meshwork of astrocytic bodies and processes. They have been determined to be astrocytes based on the typical expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and more specifically as protoplasmic astrocytes based on their morphology. Furthermore, these glial cells were found to be positive for vimentin expression, a protein commonly found in embryonic or immature glial cells. The developing neurons are identified by their expression of the cell surface molecule, a polysialylated (PSA) embryonic form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) called PSA-NCAM, as well as β-tubulin, a protein often found in postmitotic neuroblasts, proving the cells of RMS are committed to developing into neurons and will do so upon entry into the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb.</b> With the removal of NCAM, the neuroblasts scatter, proving the importance of NCAM in chain formation. The neurons form both clusters and chains along the lumen of these glial tubes.|$|E

5|$|Skeletal {{elements}} of the upper jaw {{appear to have been}} rhynchokinetic (movable in relation to each other), which must have affected its feeding behaviour. In extant birds, such as frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons, kinetic premaxillae help with consuming large food items. The beak also appears {{to have been able to}} withstand high force loads, which indicates a diet of hard food. In 2016, the first 3D endocast was made from the brain of the dodo; examination found that though the brain was similar to that of other pigeons in most respects, the dodo had a comparatively large <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb.</b> This gave the dodo a good sense of smell, which may have aided in locating fruit and small prey.|$|E
5|$|In {{humans and}} many other mammals, new neurons are created mainly before birth, and the infant brain {{contains}} substantially more neurons than the adult brain. There are, however, a few areas where new neurons continue to be generated throughout life. The two areas for which adult neurogenesis is well established are the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb,</b> which {{is involved in the}} sense of smell, and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, where there is evidence that the new neurons play a role in storing newly acquired memories. With these exceptions, however, the set of neurons that is present in early childhood is the set that is present for life. Glial cells are different: as with most types of cells in the body, they are generated throughout the lifespan.|$|E
5|$|The rostral migratory stream (RMS) is a {{specialized}} migratory route {{found in the}} brain of some animals along which neuronal precursors that originated in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the brain migrate to reach the main <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb</b> (OB). The importance of the RMS lies {{in its ability to}} refine and even change an animal's sensitivity to smells, which explains its importance and larger size in the rodent brain as compared to the human brain, as our olfactory sense is not as developed. This pathway has been studied in the rodent, rabbit, and both the squirrel monkey and rhesus monkey. When the neurons reach the OB they differentiate into GABAergic interneurons as they are integrated into either the granule cell layer or periglomerular layer.|$|E

5|$|Tyrannosaurus {{had very}} large <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs</b> and <b>olfactory</b> nerves {{relative}} to their brain size, the organs responsible for {{a heightened sense of}} smell. This suggests that the sense of smell was highly developed, and implies that tyrannosaurs could detect carcasses by scent alone across great distances. The sense of smell in tyrannosaurs may have been comparable to modern vultures, which use scent to track carcasses for scavenging. Research on the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulbs</b> has shown that Tyrannosaurus rex had the most highly developed sense of smell of 21 sampled non-avian dinosaur species.|$|R
5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb,</b> medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and basal forebrain and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are not common unless the person is demented.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of an analogous RMS in humans {{has been difficult to}} identify, possibly because the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb</b> is significantly less developed in humans than in rodents and thus harder to study, and much of the previous scientific work has been called into question concerning the RMS in humans. In the developing fetal brain and in young postnatal infants, chains of immature neurons typical of the RMS were observed. However, there was little evidence for the existence of a migrating chain along the SVZ or olfactory peduncle to the bulb in the adult human brain, even though there was a distinct population of adult neuronal stem cells in the SVZ. These researchers studied subjects from 0 to 84 years of age by analyzing brain sections that had been removed during surgery or during autopsies. They discovered that cells that expressed DCX (doublecortin) and PSA-NCAM are present in the brain sections taken from infants, but have disappeared by 18 months. Yet further studies indicated the {{presence of}} a small population of migrating immature neurons, which originate solely from the SVZ. These neuroblasts appear singly or in pairs without forming chains, in contrast to the elongated chains of neuroblasts observed in the rodent RMS. This suggests that the RMS is drastically reduced beyond infancy and especially into adulthood, but is not absent. However, a direct correlation between stem cell quiescence and age has not yet been defined due to a high level of variability between individuals. Thus an RMS analogous structure in the adult human brain remains highly controversial.|$|E
25|$|The {{mammalian}} primary {{olfactory system}} has retained {{the ability to}} continuously regenerate during adulthood. Olfactory receptor neurons have an average lifespan of 6–8 weeks and therefore must be replaced by cells differentiated from the stem cells that are within a layer at the nearby epithelium's base. The new olfactory receptor neurons must project their axons through the CNS to an <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb</b> {{in order to be}} functional. Axonal growth is guided by the glial composition and cytoarchitecture of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb</b> in addition to the presence of olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs).|$|E

25|$|Colbert's {{monograph}} on Sebecus {{included a}} description of the brain, Eustachian tubes, and jaw musculature. Details of these soft tissues were inferred from characteristics of the skull and endocasts, or molds of its interior. The deep snout of Sebecus makes the shape of its brain somewhat different from those of living crocodiles, although its structure is the same. The <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb</b> is elongate and makes up {{a significant portion of the}} brain. The cerebrum is narrow and long in comparison to crocodilians, and tapers toward the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb.</b> The temporal lobes are somewhat smaller than those of living crocodilians. Colbert interpreted the smaller cerebrum of Sebecus as a sign of primitiveness, with an evolutionary trend toward larger brain size in crocodilians. Hans C. E. Larsson performed a 2001 study of the endocranial anatomy of the dinosaur Carcharodontosaurus saharicus, comparing the ratio of its cerebrum to its total brain volume to the ratios of other prehistoric reptiles. Larsson found that Sebecus and Allosaurus fragilis had similar ratios to C. saharicus, falling within the 95% confidence range characterizing living reptile species.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian {{olfactory}} cues play {{an important}} role in the coordination of the mother infant bond, and the following normal development of the offspring. The offspring of several different mammals are attracted to the odor of amniotic fluid, which helps to calm and adapt the infant to the novel environment outside of the womb. Sheep form olfactory recognition memory for their lambs within 2–4 hours of giving birth, which causes the mother to subsequently reject advances from unfamiliar lambs and scents. This bond is thought to be enhanced by olfactory cues that cause enhanced transmission across synapses of the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb.</b> After the birth of the offspring, there is a shift in the value of the infant’s odors to the mother, which causes change in neural structures such as the <b>olfactory</b> <b>bulb.</b> These changes contribute to maternal responsiveness and memorization of these odors. Olfactory cues from the baby lamb are important in establishing maternal behavior and bonding. After birth, the smell of amniotic fluid (which was previously disgusting) becomes attractive for ewes.|$|E
