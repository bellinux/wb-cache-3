5|$|In 2003, Let It Be... Naked, a reconceived {{version of}} the Let It Be album, with McCartney supervising production, was released. One of the main {{differences}} with the Spector-produced version was the omission of the <b>original</b> <b>string</b> arrangements. It was a top ten hit in both Britain and America. The US album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 – The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 and Volume 2 included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl {{at the time of}} the music's original American release.|$|E
25|$|For {{function}} that manipulate strings, modern object-oriented languages, like C# and Java have immutable strings and return a copy (in newly allocated dynamic memory), while others, like C manipulate the <b>original</b> <b>string</b> unless the programmer copies data {{to a new}} string.

25|$|Edgar never {{discussed}} his early musical training in detail with {{anyone in the}} science fiction, fantasy, or mystery fields. It was known that he studied the piano and violin, but that was all. In 2003, however, a large stack of handwritten music manuscripts were discovered in the attic of the Bearsville house in which Edgar died. These manuscripts included <b>original</b> <b>string</b> quartets, sonatas, nocturnes, and other orchestral forms written by Edgar during his music conservatory days.|$|E
40|$|Classical {{fingerprinting}} {{associates with}} each string a shorter string (its fingerprint), such that, with high probability, any two distinct strings {{can be distinguished}} by comparing their fingerprints alone. The fingerprints can be exponentially smaller than the <b>original</b> <b>strings</b> if the parties preparing the fingerprints share a random key, but not if they only have access to uncorrelated random sources. In this paper we show that fingerprints consisting of quantum information can be made exponentially smaller than the <b>original</b> <b>strings</b> without any correlations or entanglement between the parties: we give a scheme where the quantum fingerprints are exponentially shorter than the <b>original</b> <b>strings</b> and we give a test that distinguishes any two unknown quantum fingerprints with high probability. Our scheme implies an exponential quantum/classical gap for the equality problem in the simultaneous message passing model of communication complexity. We optimize several aspects of our scheme. ...|$|R

25|$|The strings {{may have}} been thicker than {{harpsichord}} strings of the same period, {{although there are no}} <b>original</b> <b>string</b> gauge markings on any of the three surviving pianos to prove this. Thicker strings are thought to be better suited to the hammer blows. Comparing the two 1726 instruments, one a piano, the other a harpsichord, the lengths of the 8-foot strings are almost the same, certainly in the upper halves of the compasses of the two instruments.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{programs}} use Unicode strings {{to allow}} internationalization of text. Often, these programs will convert incoming ASCII strings to Unicode before processing them. Unicode strings encoded in UTF-16 use two bytes to encode each character (or four bytes for some special characters). When an ASCII string {{is transformed into}} UTF-16, a zero byte is inserted after each byte in the <b>original</b> <b>string.</b> Obscou proved in Phrack 61 {{that it is possible}} to write shellcode that can run successfully after this transformation. Programs that can automatically encode any shellcode into alphanumeric UTF-16-proof shellcode exist, based on the same principle of a small self-modifying decoder that decodes the original shellcode.|$|E

Lowe was originally expected to be a guest star departing from the show after the episode [...] "Indianapolis". However, after his <b>original</b> <b>string</b> of episodes were filmed, Lowe was signed as a permanent Parks and Recreation cast member, prompting the writers {{to find a way to}} reintroduce the character to the series.

50|$|The <b>original</b> <b>strings</b> {{were made}} out of sheep intestine, similar {{to the use of}} catgut (made from the {{intestines}} of cattle) in violins. The village people allotted intestines of sheep, sacrificed during major festivals like Dasain, to the Gandarvas. The Gandarvas left the intestine in a pot for some days. Once the meat was fully rotten, it was pulled out, leaving behind the fine nerves of the intestine which were then woven to get the strings, which produced fine quality sound. However these days, readily available nylon and steel strings have generally replaced gut strings.|$|R
