5|$|In 1908, Baith Israel {{merged with}} Degraw Street's Talmud Torah Anshei Emes Synagogue, a growing {{congregation}} {{that had become}} too large for the row house in which it held services. Talmud Torah Anshei Emes's membership was mostly made up of Eastern European Jews, who were stricter in their observances than Baith Israel's mostly German-origin membership; to accommodate them, a special all-men section of pews was designated at the front left <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary.</b>|$|E
5|$|A temple {{dedicated}} to the goddess Satet, personification of the Nile floods, had stood {{on the island of}} Elephantine to the south of Egypt since at least the late Predynastic Period around 3200 BC. The temple was enlarged and renovated several times from the Early Dynastic Period onwards and was again rebuilt {{in the course of the}} Fifth Dynasty, possibly during Nyuserre's reign. A faience plaque bearing Nyuserre's name was discovered in a deposit of votive offerings located under the floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary.</b> Unfortunately, this deposit does not represent the original context of the plaque, which could have once adorned the walls of the temple or could equally have been deposed in a foundational offering made in anticipation of the temple reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|Nearly 300 {{households}} {{were members}} by 2006, {{and in the}} same year, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation awarded the synagogue a grant of $350,000 for exterior restoration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary.</b> The grant was part of a million-dollar capital campaign that the membership intended to carry out in 2008, as the synagogue building still required extensive repairs: the roof leaked, causing interior damage, and (along with the gutters) needed to be replaced; interior columns were taped to prevent plaster from falling off them; the sanctuary doors needed to be replaced; and the stained glass windows needed to be removed, the metal holding them repaired, and their wooden framing replaced. In 2007 the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites Program awarded Baith Israel Anshei Emes grants totaling $17,500, for copper roof and masonry restoration.|$|E

5|$|Tamagnino {{is known}} to have left Brescia while the {{construction}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> was ongoing, evidently finding his work undervalued and underpaid. The reasons for the bias are unclear, but it is possible that Cairano enjoyed local favour, especially from the directors of the company commissioning the shrine, which allowed him to prevail over Tamagnino despite the latter's technical superiority. Tamagnino then won the prestigious contract for the façade of the Certosa of Pavia, to be installed under the aegis of Father Amedeo and Antonio Mantegazza. The corporate pact between the artist and the two sculptors strengthened in May 1492, providing Tamagnino with a unique training experience as well as a remarkable leap in his career.|$|E

5|$|The Mumbai slum set in {{the season}} finale was {{constructed}} on {{the parking lot of}} the studio, which took two to three weeks to complete. The finale was filmed during one of the hottest heatwaves to hit British Columbia; Tapping found that the set was hotter than the average temperature of the actual Mumbai. Three main cameras were used, one of which was crane-operated. 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an Sanctuary episode. For the extras to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes. The streeting area was also limited in size, so the streets were recycled frequently with every scene. The practical sets <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sanctuary</b> offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary.|$|E

50|$|Enough {{architectural}} evidence remains {{from the}} late Battiad period to enable one to confidently assert some existence of an Upper Sanctuary and a Middle <b>Sanctuary.</b> Although <b>the</b> identity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Upper <b>Sanctuary's</b> Classical buildings remains {{for the most part}} ambiguous until as late as the Hellenistic period, the artifactual evidence for cultic activity on this level is extremely good. <b>The</b> <b>Sanctuary's</b> expansion north or down the wadi slope to <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lower <b>Sanctuary</b> does not occur until the early Imperial period when both the Upper and <b>the</b> Lower <b>Sanctuary</b> levels take on <b>the</b> architectural features <b>of</b> what henceforth remain their characteristic layouts until <b>the</b> earthquake <b>of</b> 262 AD. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site's architectural limestone and marble frusta located scattered throughout the earthquake levels across <b>the</b> Middle <b>Sanctuary</b> appears to have originated with the Imperial period Upper Sanctuary additions. It is these additions which furnish most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sanctuary's</b> restorable monuments. Moreover, although most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surviving evidence for building activity down to <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hellenistic period pertains to <b>the</b> Middle <b>Sanctuary,</b> in years leading up to <b>the</b> <b>Sanctuary's</b> earthquake destructions in the 3rd and 4th centuries, little new architectural endeavors are undertaken across most of its ca. 1900 sq. m. interior. Instead what new construction occurs takes place mainly at <b>the</b> Upper <b>Sanctuary</b> level. On <b>the</b> whole, <b>the</b> <b>Sanctuary</b> <b>of</b> Demeter and Persephone is a physical expansion covering approximately six hundred years <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occupation <b>of</b> its Upper and Middle Sanctuary grounds.|$|R
5|$|The {{south side}} of the nave is characterised by eight bays with stepped buttresses between them, with aisle windows {{featuring}} reticulated heads. At the side of the south aisle <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuary</b> is Chapter House, a small, square building, of two storeys. It dates to the mid 13th century and is made from Chipping Camden and Bath limestone, with some local red sandstone from Radyr. The octagonal roof was the brainchild of Prichard, though it was lowered in pitch by Pace and later worked on by Donald Buttress. The buttresses of the building are made from ashlar. The seven stained glass roundels are of 16th century Flemish origin. In the interior is a pulpit featuring Moses. Also of note is the St David's Chapel, added by George Pace in 1953–56, which is accessed through the Norman north door of the cathedral.|$|E
5|$|Zimmerman {{returns to}} the Sanctuary also after his unit are killed by the attacks. Now believing Magnus is who she says she is, Zimmerman recounts {{the events of the}} plague to her; ten years ago, a {{contagion}} was released in Old City, transforming humans to cannibalistic creatures. When containing the city failed, the disease spread throughout the globe and despite her best efforts, Magnus could not find a cure and was eventually killed in Buenos Aires. Several world governments deployed nuclear weapons in an attempt to stop the threat until they fell. All Sanctuary personnel apart from Zimmerman were killed in the process. Only around 100,000 unaffected humans remain in colonies in the Arctic and remote islands. Jessica is revealed to be infected and alerts the creatures to the Sanctuary after she transforms, forcing Zimmerman to kill her. Both Magnus and Zimmerman fortify one section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sanctuary</b> so Magnus can learn, via computer files, how the plague started. Zimmerman is revealed to have been infected during his last skirmish, and sacrifices himself to buy Magnus more time.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{the most relevant}} results of a thorough archaeoastronomical study conducted since 1997 in several tens of Iberian archaeological sites, most of them located in <b>the</b> southeast <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Iberian Peninsula. We found that a substantial fraction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuaries</b> studied, all <b>of</b> them dedicated to a feminine goddess, shows a marker <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sunrise or sunset on conspicuous elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizon at the equinoxes or a date very close to it, possibly the temporal midpoint between solstices. This result suggests the existence among <b>the</b> Iberians <b>of</b> rituals associated with seasonality, agrarian festivities of fecundity similar to other well-known ones <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient Mediterranean. <b>The</b> earliest chronology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sanctuaries</b> related to <b>the</b> equinoxes indicates that they became operational around mid-IV BCE, coincident with a period of major ideological changes in the Iberian society and increased Punic influence in the area. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results suggests a possible influence of Greco-Punic beliefs on <b>the</b> astronomical aspects <b>of</b> Iberian ritual...|$|R
