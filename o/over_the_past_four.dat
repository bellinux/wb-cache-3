40|$|This report {{examines}} measurement {{issues related}} to the amount of electricity used by the commercial sector in the U. S. and the implications for historical trends of commercial building electricity intensity (kWh/sq. ft. of floor space). The report compares two (Energy Information Administration) sources of data related to commercial buildings: the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) and the reporting by utilities of sales to commercial customers (survey Form- 861). Over past two decades these sources suggest significantly different trend rates of growth of electricity intensity, with the supply (utility) -based estimate growing much faster than that based only upon the CBECS. The report undertakes various data adjustments in an attempt to rationalize the differences between these two sources. These adjustments deal with: 1) periodic reclassifications of industrial vs. commercial electricity usage at the state level and 2) the amount of electricity used by non-enclosed equipment (non-building use) that is classified as commercial electricity sales. In part, after applying these adjustments, there is a good correspondence between <b>the</b> two sources <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>four</b> CBECS (beginning with 1992).
