5|$|For the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden, two new multi-event {{disciplines}} were included, the pentathlon and the decathlon. A pentathlon, based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> Greek event, {{had been}} introduced at the 1906 Intercalated Games. The 1912 version consisted of the long jump, javelin throw, 200-meter dash, discus throw and 1500-meter run.|$|E
5|$|Brownhills is {{situated}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> Watling Street {{and there is}} evidence of early settlement in the area, including an ancient burial mound and a guard post believed to date from Roman times and later dubbed Knaves Castle. The name Brownhills, however, is not recorded before the 17th century. The most popular suggestion for the origin of the name is that it refers to the early mining spoil heaps which dotted the area.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{discovered}} of a Roman road passing through the area, <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> route between Coccium (Wigan) and Mamucium (Manchester). Following the Anglo-Saxon invasion of England, Atherton, which is built on and around seven brooks, {{became part of the}} manor of Warrington until the Norman conquest, when it became a township or vill in the ancient parish of Leigh. Since 1974 the town {{has been part of the}} Metropolitan Borough of Wigan, a local government district of the Metropolitan County of Greater Manchester.|$|E

5|$|The 60th Division {{commanded}} by Major General J. S. M. Shea, was to fight <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> battlefield between Arsuf and the Nahr el Faliq, where in 1191 King Richard defeated Saladin and avenged Hattin. Shea's infantry division was {{to advance to}} establish a bridgehead across the Nahr el Faliq and create {{a gap in the}} front line for the cavalry. Then the 60th Division was to advance north-east to capture Tulkarm and cut the railway line east of it.|$|E
5|$|The race {{starts in}} Port Town, with the winners {{traveling}} {{in a boat}} to a large desert. Legend has it that four stone tablets are buried somewhere in the desert, and the contestants are sent out to dig for them {{and bring them to}} the Viscount. According to the stone tablets, the actual location of the Crystal is hidden somewhere <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> map. Before he can investigate the matter further, Doctor Neo Cortex swoops in and snatches the map. As the two struggle for the map, the map is torn to shreds.|$|E
5|$|As their {{relationship}} had become increasingly strained, {{his wife had}} left and returned to Britain. Although hoping to leave his post in India several months early, he was concerned for his economic prospects, and desperately searched for a new position. Through friends in the British archaeological community, he was offered a job as the Secretary of the Royal Commission <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> and Historical Monuments of Wales, although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his professional status and income and decided to turn it down. Instead, he agreed {{to take up a}} chair in the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces at the Institute of Archaeology. In addition, the Pakistani Minister of Education invited him to become the Archaeological Adviser to the Pakistani government; he agreed to also take up this position, on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three.|$|E

5|$|From late 1651, passes {{were needed}} {{to move from one}} area of the country to another. The {{ownership}} of firearms was restricted, necessitating a licence. In the Highlands the administration fell back <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> expedient of making clan chiefs responsible for the conduct of their followers. The security of the regime depended on an armed force of never less than 10,000 men. Citadels were built at Ayr, Perth and Leith and 20 smaller forts were built as far away as Orkney and Stornoway. Control of the Highlands was secured by strongpoints at Inverlocky and Inverness. These were built at a massive cost of money and manpower. The citadel at Inverness, begun in 1652 and using stone shipped {{from as far away as}} Aberdeen, had cost £50,000 in 1655, when it was still unfinished. Inverlocky had a garrison of 1,000 and from 1654 became the centre for a new administrative region of Lochaber, made up of three of the most remote and lawless shires.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the site}} of Noel Park was {{virtually}} uninhabited. The 1619 Earl of Dorset's Survey of Tottenham shows the area as forming the historic Duckett's (Dovecote) Manor; as {{with the rest of}} the Moselle valley, the land consisted almost entirely of woodland and pasture, with the only building shown in the area which was to become Noel Park being Dovecote House itself, dating from 1254 and the earliest recorded property in Wood Green. The small village of Wood Green itself is shown a short distance to the north-east. The manor itself was situated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> arterial road of Green Lanes. The last recorded occupancy of the manor was in 1881, shortly before the site was cleared for the construction of Noel Park.|$|E
5|$|In his {{commentary}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> Confucian philosopher Mencius (372–289 BC), Shen {{wrote of}} the importance of choosing to follow what one knew to be a true path, yet the heart and mind could not attain full knowledge of truth through mere sensory experience. In his own unique way but using terms influenced by the ideas of Mencius, Shen wrote of an autonomous inner authority that formed the basis for one's inclination towards moral choices, a concept linked to Shen's life experiences of surviving and obtaining success through self-reliance. Along with his commentary on the Chinese classic texts, Shen Kuo also wrote extensively on the topics of supernatural divination and Buddhist meditation.|$|E

The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant – the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark, their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra {{is the key to}} finding the Well of Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried.|$|E
5|$|List began lecturing {{on these}} subjects; for instance, in February 1893 {{he spoke to}} the {{nationalist}} Verein 'Deutsches Geschichte' ("'German History' Association) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> priesthood of Wotan. He also worked as a playwright, and in December 1894 his play Der Wala Erweckung ("The Wala's Awakening") was premiered at an event organised by the Bund der Germanen (Germanic League) which was devoted to the German nationalist cause, with Jews being explicitly banned from attending the event. Alongside his affiliation with the Bund, List was {{also a member of the}} Deutscher Turnverein (Germanic Gymnastic League), a strongly nationalistic group to whom he contributed literary works for their events.|$|E
5|$|Monteverdi's next {{commission}} from Mantua {{came early}} in 1618, {{when he was}} asked to provide the music for Andromeda, an opera based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> Greek myth of the princess chained to a rock. The libretto was written by Duke Ferdinando's chancellor, Ercole Marigliani, and the project was sponsored by the duke's younger brother, Don Vincenzo Gonzaga. It is probable that the work was intended for performance at the Mantua Carnival of March 1618, but as Carter records, Monteverdi's approach to his Mantua commissions was often dilatory and half-hearted; his inability or unwillingness to work on Andromeda delayed its performance, first to 1619 and then to 1620.|$|E

5|$|The {{design of}} the Shrine is based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> Mausoleum of Maussollos at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, and the Parthenon in Athens. It is a {{structure}} of square plan roofed by a stepped pyramid and entered on {{the north and south}} through classical porticos, each of eight fluted Doric columns supporting a pediment containing sculpture in high relief. The porticos are approached by wide flights of steps which rise in stages to the podium on which the Shrine sits. The east and west facing fronts are marked at the corners by four groups of statuary by Paul Raphael Montford, representing Peace, Justice, Patriotism and Sacrifice. The Art Deco style and motifs draw on Greek and Assyrian sculpture. The symbolism is Neo-Classical.|$|E
5|$|The {{interpretation}} of Tibbers {{has changed over}} time, and in the 18th century it {{was thought to be}} a Roman fort though it was later understood to be a medieval castle. The name of the castle led to the suggestion that it derived from Tiberius Caesar, however 'Tibbers' comes from the Gaelic word 'Toibar' meaning a well. The earliest recorded excavation at Tibbers Castle took place in 1864, which recovered two coins from the reign of Edward II of England (1307–1327) and a dagger from the early 15th century. The site was surveyed in 1912 with no further archaeological investigation until the 21st century. It was designated as a scheduled ancient monument in 1937. In 2013 and 2014 the Royal Commission <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ancient</b> and Historical Monuments of Scotland carried out measured and geophysical (using resistivity and a gradiometer) surveys at Tibbers with funding from Historic Scotland and the Castle Studies Trust.|$|E
5|$|The town lies <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> Watling Street, {{but is not}} {{recorded}} before the 17th century, although Ogley Hay, which in modern times is a district of the town, is recorded as a settlement in the Domesday Book. Brownhills quickly grew around the coal mining industry, especially after it became linked to the canal and railway networks in the mid-19th century, {{and by the end}} of the century had grown from a hamlet of only 300 inhabitants to a town with a population of over , of whom the vast majority were employed in the coal industry. Mining remained the town's principal industry until the 1950s, but the subsequent closure of the area's pits led to a severe economic decline which has continued until the present day. The local authority has instituted a regeneration programme which it is hoped will revive the town's fortunes, providing better transport and leisure facilities.|$|E

5|$|The short-tailed isopods {{have a short}} pleotelson and terminal, stylus-like uropods {{and have}} a {{sedentary}} lifestyle on or under the sediment on the seabed. The long-tailed isopods have a long pleotelson and broad lateral uropods {{which can be used}} in swimming. They are much more active and can launch themselves off the seabed and swim for short distances. The more advanced long-tailed isopods are mostly endemic to the southern hemisphere and may have radiated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ancient</b> supercontinent of Gondwana soon after it broke away from Laurasia 200 million years ago. The short-tailed forms may have been driven from the shallow seas in which they lived by increased predatory pressure from marine fish, their main predators. The development of the long-tailed forms may also have provided competition that helped force the short-tailed forms into refugia. The latter are now restricted to environments such as the deep sea, freshwater, groundwater and dry land. Isopods in the suborder Asellota are by far the most species-rich group of deep sea isopods.|$|E
