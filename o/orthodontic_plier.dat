40|$|Removal of a {{permanently}} cemented crown or fixed partial denture is a cumbersome {{procedure for}} a prosthodontist, {{especially when there}} is no purchase point available to remove it. The technique described in this article consists of sectioning of a crown on facial surface followed by removal of the crown with <b>orthodontic</b> <b>plier.</b> This technique does not damage the gingival/periodontal tissues or underlying tooth structure as the crown need not to be removed with jerky back-action force...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY Five {{commonly}} used types of <b>orthodontic</b> <b>plier</b> of similar design, but different manufac-ture were evaluated for wear and corrosion following a 6 -month regime of routine {{use in a}} hospital department together with steam autoclaving in a centralized unit. Three different types of manufacture (metal finish) were evaluated: (1) a stainless steel plier; (2) a chrome plated plier; and (3) a cheaper chrome plated plier. Four identical kits for changing archwires were assembled {{for each of the}} three manufacture types. A sixth 'plier', always of chrome plated manufacture (group 2) was added to every kit and acted as an additional control. In all, 72 pliers were evaluated by three observers immediately before and after the trial. Visual analogue and rank scales were used to assess corrosion, damage, the efficiency of the plier, etc. Generally, all of the pliers stood up well to a combination of routine clinical use and steam autoclaving; however, the stainless steel pliers appeared to perform the best. It is likely that the most important factor, when setting up this type of sterilizing method for orthodontic instruments, is to establish a careful and meticulous routine for cleaning, lubricating, and steam autoclaving pliers...|$|E
