25|$|In the following, we have {{to remind}} <b>ourselves</b> <b>that</b> every one of Turing’s “computing machines” is a binary-number generator/creator that begins work on “blank tape”. Properly constructed, it always cranks away ad infinitum, but its {{instructions}} are always finite. In Turing’s proofs, Turing’s tape had a “left end” but extended right ad infinitum. For sake of example below we will assume that the “machine” is not a Universal machine, but rather the simpler “dedicated machine” with the instructions in the Table.|$|E
25|$|Some {{people have}} {{characterized}} his removal as a rendition. That {{is not what}} happened here. It was a deportation.

And we do that in every case. And if in fact he had been rendered to Syria, we would have sought those same kind of assurances, as we do in every case.|$|E
25|$|The 29th had dawned calm, {{but while}} we were still trying to persuade <b>ourselves</b> <b>that</b> the tragedy was over and the volcano had {{exhausted}} its bowels, at about 8 o'clock, we heard a crash and then I noticed that smoke was rising {{from the point of}} the island that looks towards east. The smoke spread very gradually as far as the crater of the volcano, while there were many whiffs issuing from points in the direction of another headland. I realized that the island had opened in these places and fearing that, if a crater should open below the water, an explosion might follow, much more formidable than the preceding ones, I mounted a horse and retired permanently to the Sanctuary of Caysasay.|$|E

25|$|Religion, Unger argues, is {{a vision}} of the world within which we anchor our {{orientation}} to life. It is within this orientation that we deal with our greatest terrors and highest hopes. Because we are doomed to die, we hope for eternal life; because we are unable to grasp to totality of existence or of the universe, we try to dispel the mystery and provide a comprehensible explanation; because we have an insatiable desire, we cry for an object that is worthy of this desire, one that is infinite. Humans initially invested religious discourse in nature and the human susceptibility to nature. But as societies evolved and people developed ways to cope with the unpredictability of nature, the emphasis of religion shifted to social existence and its defects. A new moment in religion will begin, Unger argues, when we stop telling <b>ourselves</b> <b>that</b> all will be fine and we begin to face the incorrigible flaws in human existence. The future of religion lies in embracing our mortality and our groundlessness.|$|E
500|$|Faced with a vacancy, Disraeli and Derby tried {{yet again}} to bring Gladstone, still {{nominally}} a Conservative MP, into the government, hoping to strengthen it. Disraeli wrote a personal letter to Gladstone, {{asking him to}} place {{the good of the}} party above personal animosity: [...] "Every man performs his office, and there is a Power, greater than <b>ourselves,</b> <b>that</b> disposes of all this." [...] In responding to Disraeli, Gladstone denied that personal feelings played any role in his decisions then and previously whether to accept office, while acknowledging that there were differences between him and Derby [...] "broader than you may have supposed".|$|E

We tried to put guitar solos on, but we kept on running into this problem. It really sounded like an afterthought." [...] Hammett said that he was happy with the final product. Rock stated, [...] "We made a promise to <b>ourselves</b> <b>that</b> we'd only keep stuff that had integrity. We didn't want to make a theatrical statement by adding overdubs." ...|$|E

He added that [...] "the Na'vi represent something that is our higher selves, or our aspirational selves, what we would like to think we are" [...] and that even though there are good humans within the film, the humans [...] "represent what we know to be the parts of <b>ourselves</b> <b>that</b> are trashing our world and maybe condemning ourselves to a grim future".|$|E

[...] "We were consciously trying to go, well, if video games are going to develop into the next stage, then the thing isn't {{to try and do}} a loving tribute or reference other stuff. It's to reference the actual place itself". Houser also said, [...] "In terms of the character, we wanted something that felt fresh and new and not something that was obviously derived from [...] movie. [...] Maybe [...] could do something <b>ourselves</b> <b>that</b> would live alongside that stuff".|$|E

In August 2012 {{she wrote a}} column published in The Times of India titled [...] "No woman in Mumbai feels safe any longer", discussing the murder of 25-year-old Pallavi Purkayastha, whom she met while working on Don. In the article, Chopra expressed her views {{about the safety of}} women in cities. She wrote: [...] "The magnitude of this crime can perhaps only truly be understood by a woman. It has much larger ramifications. We can't allow this to happen. We have to, in whichever way we can, ensure that what happened with Pallavi does not happen again. We need to remind <b>ourselves</b> <b>that</b> we women today are a vital contributor to the growth of the new India." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1968, Wright {{commented on}} Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: [...] "It's {{hard to see}} why we were cast as the first British {{psychedelic}} group. We never saw <b>ourselves</b> <b>that</b> way... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted... the emphasis... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." [...] Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: [...] "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental'...Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't {{want to go back to}} playing [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for hours and hours." [...] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|In April 1918, {{during the}} latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi. Gandhi agreed to {{actively}} recruit Indians for the war effort. In contrast to the Zulu War of 1906 and the outbreak of World War I in 1914, when he recruited volunteers for the Ambulance Corps, this time Gandhi attempted to recruit combatants. In a June 1918 leaflet entitled [...] "Appeal for Enlistment", Gandhi wrote [...] "To bring about such a state of things we should have the ability to defend <b>ourselves,</b> <b>that</b> is, the ability to bear arms and to use them...If we want to learn the use of arms with the greatest possible despatch, it is our duty to enlist ourselves in the army." [...] He did, however, stipulate {{in a letter to the}} Viceroy's private secretary that he [...] "personally will not kill or injure anybody, friend or foe." ...|$|E
500|$|James Cameron {{has said}} that he [...] "tried to make a film that would touch people's spirituality across the broad spectrum." [...] He also stated that one of the film's {{philosophical}} underpinnings is that [...] "the Na'vi represent that sort of aspirational part of <b>ourselves</b> <b>that</b> wants to be better, that wants to respect nature, while the humans in the film represent the more venal versions of ourselves, the banality of evil that comes with corporate decisions that are made out of remove of the consequences." [...] Film director John Boorman saw a similar dichotomy as a key factor contributing to its success: [...] "Perhaps the key is the marine in the wheelchair. [...] He is disabled, but Mr Cameron and technology can transport him into the body of a beautiful, athletic, sexual, being. [...] After all, we are all disabled in one way or another; inadequate, old, broken, earthbound. [...] Pandora is a kind of heaven where we can be resurrected and connected instead of disconnected and alone." ...|$|E

500|$|Many Stanford alumni {{were upset}} with the {{decision}} to hire Shaughnessy. The most popular candidates for the vacant position were two Stanford alumni themselves: San Jose State coach Dudley DeGroot, and Santa Clara coach Buck Shaw. Some believed the Shaughnessy hiring was a ploy to eventually eliminate football at the school, as had happened at both Loyola and Chicago the year prior. The Bay Area media mocked the Shaughnessy hiring as comically inept. They believed that a prestigious academic school had foolishly hired an inveterate loser as its head coach. Prescott Sulivan of the San Francisco Examiner and Jack McDonald of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin coined the nickname [...] "Soup" [...] for Shaughnessy, which they sarcastically explained was a diminutive for the word [...] "super". Sullivan wrote, [...] "We have heard it said that Shaughnessy has developed the knack of losing to the point where, with him, it is an exact science. In light of his record, we aren't at all surprised at this." [...] The Stanford players were also skeptical of Shaughnessy's abilities. Center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd been reading about all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among <b>ourselves</b> <b>that</b> wasn't it just like Stanford to hire somebody like this to coach us." ...|$|E
500|$|On September 21, 2011, R.E.M. {{announced}} via {{its website}} {{that it was}} [...] "calling it a day as a band". Stipe said that he hoped fans realized it [...] "wasn't an easy decision": [...] "All things must end, {{and we wanted to}} do it right, to do it our way." [...] Long-time associate and former Warner Bros. Senior Vice President of Emerging Technology Ethan Kaplan has speculated that shake-ups at the record label influenced the group's decision to disband. The group discussed breaking up for several years, but was encouraged to continue after the lackluster critical and commercial performance of Around the Sun; according to Mills, [...] "We needed to prove, not only to our fans and critics but to <b>ourselves,</b> <b>that</b> we could still make great records." [...] They were also uninterested in the business end of recording as R.E.M. The band members finished their collaboration by assembling the compilation album Part Lies, Part Heart, Part Truth, Part Garbage 1982–2011, which was released in November 2011. The album is the first to collect songs from R.E.M.'s I.R.S. and Warner Bros. tenures, as well as three songs from the group's final studio recordings from post-Collapse into Now sessions. In November, Mills and Stipe did a brief span of promotional appearances in British media, ruling out the option of the group ever reuniting.|$|E
500|$|In {{the last}} {{scene of the}} episode, Bart is seen writing [...] "I will not expose the ignorance of the faculty" [...] on the {{blackboard}} as a punishment for exposing the ignorance of the teachers by removing the Teachers' Editions. In his book The Small Screen: How Television Equips Us to Live in the Information Age, Brian L. Ott describes this scene {{as one of the}} [...] "key ways The Simpsons appeals to audience, which tends to be younger, by critiquing authority figures, and in particular educators." [...] Toby Daspit and John Weaver write in their book Popular Culture and Critical Pedagogy: Reading, Constructing, Connecting that the writers of The Simpsons are [...] "particularly interested" [...] in questions about authority and the abuses of powers in school. Another scene from the episode sees Ms. Hoover telling the students to stare at the blackboard for fifteen minutes until class is over. Daspit and Weaver write that it is [...] "the absolute power that teachers have over students' every action that allows for the image to be presented on The Simpsons. It would be comforting to tell <b>ourselves</b> <b>that</b> this is simply parody run amok, that the writers are stretching reality to make a point, but the discussants in the study [...] had memories of a reality very much like the one presented in this program." [...] One of the discussants said she believes everyone has experienced similar situations in their school years, and she thinks the thought that [...] "an educator could ever do something so useless and pointless with the children's time" [...] is [...] "frightening".|$|E

2500|$|In popular usage, mind is {{frequently}} synonymous with thought: the private conversation with <b>ourselves</b> <b>that</b> we carry on [...] "inside our heads."
