5|$|Following the war, Pickett feared {{prosecution}} for his execution of deserters and temporarily fled to Canada. He returned to Virginia in 1866, {{where he died}} at age 50 in 1875. Legend says that after the war he remained bitter and dwelt extensively upon the loss <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> at Gettysburg.|$|E
5|$|In March 1864, Ross's brigade {{fought against}} African American {{soldiers}} {{for the first}} time at Yazoo City, Mississippi. After bitter fighting, the Confederates were victorious. During the surrender negotiations, the Union officer accused the Texans of murdering several captured African American soldiers. Ross claimed two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> had likewise been killed after surrendering to Union troops.|$|E
5|$|Once back in Britain {{he spent}} much of his time recruiting, and he was placed in charge of {{recruits}} on Jersey. He purchased his majority on 27 June 1795, and rejoined his regiment in 1796, when the rest <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> returned from the West Indies.|$|E

5|$|Only the Emir's son, at {{the head}} of a small force, managed to escape the battlefield, fleeing south towards the border area of Charsianon. He was, however, pursued by Machairas, the kleisourarchēs of Charsianon, and was {{defeated}} and captured with many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E
5|$|Parrish demanded high {{standards}} of performance <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> and did not view race as an issue. Parrish felt that what mattered was professionalism and an individual's capacities, techniques, and judgement. Parrish held his black trainees to the same {{high standards}} of performance as whites; {{and those who did}} not meet those standards were failed out of the program.|$|E
5|$|Stark {{began to}} move his force to Hog Island at about 10 am and {{directed}} most <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> to round up livestock there while he forded Crooked Creek to Noddle's Island {{with a group of}} thirty men. Stark's small contingent on Noddle's Island scattered into small groups, killed the animals they could find, and set fire to haystacks and barns.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} {{evening in}} Cair Andros, Faramir sent his company south {{to reinforce the}} garrison at Osgiliath, while he and three <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> rode to Minas Tirith. Along the way, they were pursued by Sauron's servants, the Nazgûl. Faramir rode back to help the fallen. Immediately, Gandalf rode out to their aid, temporarily banishing the Nazgûl.|$|E
5|$|After {{five hours}} of fighting, the troops subdued the Comanche resistance. Buffalo Hump escaped, but 70 Comanches were killed or mortally wounded, only two of them noncombatants. Ross's {{injuries}} were severe, and for five days he lay under a tree on the battlefield, unable to be moved. His wounds became infected, and Ross begged the others to kill him to end his pain. When {{he was able to}} travel, he was first carried on a litter suspended between two mules, and then on the shoulders <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men.</b> He recovered fully, but experienced some pain for {{much of the rest of}} the year.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Manila, MacArthur {{turned his}} {{attention}} to Yamashita, who had retreated into the mountains of central and northern Luzon. Yamashita chose to fight a defensive campaign, being pushed back slowly by Krueger, and was still holding out at the time the war ended, much to MacArthur's intense annoyance as he had wished to liberate the entire Philippines before the war ended. On 2 September 1945, Yamashita (who had a hard time believing that the Emperor had ordered Japan to sign an armistice) came down from the mountains to surrender with some 100,000 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Some {{defensive}} schemes employ [...] "key" [...] blitzes where {{a player}} will blitz only if <b>his</b> assigned <b>man</b> stays in to block, thus keying his action off the action <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>man.</b> If <b>his</b> <b>man</b> releases into a pass pattern, then the defensive player will cover him. For example, if weak side linebacker has the fullback as <b>his</b> <b>man,</b> if upon the snap {{of the ball}} the fullback blocks, the linebacker will blitz.|$|R
60|$|Some {{one called}} Kurt. The voice was Jerry's. It seemed hoarse and strained. Kurt {{could see the}} lean form <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>man,</b> {{standing}} {{in the light of}} the lantern. A small dark group of men, silent and somehow impressive, stood off a little in the shadow.|$|R

5|$|Against {{the advice}} of Captain Dove, Paxton {{continued}} to advance the regiment. The element of surprise was gone, and it was dark. Dove knew the probability of being attacked was high, and he took steps to minimize the danger to the main column. The advance guard was ambushed around 1:00 am on May 2. Dove received a severe wound on his foot, and two <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> were killed. The regiment's total losses were four killed, eight wounded, and four missing—plus 28 horses killed. Paxton, who was popular with the regiment, was dismissed by General Eliakim P. Scammon after the regiment returned to camp.|$|E
5|$|Although outnumbered ten-to-one by the Pakistani troops, the Sikhs {{repelled}} {{their attacks}} multiple times. With their ammunition running out, Singh ordered {{his men to}} join the main company, knowing that reinforcement was impossible under Pakistani shelling. With the help of another soldier, he brought two injured men along, though he himself was wounded. Under the heavy Pakistani fire, Singh moved from position to position, boosting the morale <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> and intermittently throwing grenades. Despite being wounded twice, he refused evacuation and continued to hold {{the first line of}} trenches.|$|E
5|$|An Italian officer {{entered the}} station, and {{informed}} {{the medical staff}} they were now prisoners of war. But since they were treating casualties from both sides, {{they were allowed to}} remain and continue operating. Treatment of the wounded continued all day, and by 22:00 the surgeons had carried out 21 surgical operations and were looking after 62 British and 29 German or Italian patients. At 18:30, in the darkness, Lathbury led the remainder <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> to join the 2nd Parachute Battalion.|$|E
60|$|Having, in {{the absence}} of any more words, put this sudden climax to what he had faintly {{intended}} should be a long explanation of the whole life and character <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>man,</b> the oracular John Willet led the gentleman up his wide dismantled staircase into the Maypole's best apartment.|$|R

5|$|Arnold {{was not in}} a {{position}} to influence what transpired at Fort Griswold, as he remained in New London and observed the action at Fort Griswold across the river. He was blamed by many on both sides for the affair, however, because he was the commanding officer who bore full responsibility for the actions <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men.</b> American sentiments were further inflamed against him for the simple fact that he had betrayed and killed those among whom he had grown up.|$|E
5|$|At this point, {{the horses}} were nearly blown, but d'Hautpoul's cuirassiers charged the third line, which they also broke. The Russian cossacks, {{assembled}} in the reserve, entered the melee, but their light horses were {{no match for the}} French mounts, big horses confiscated from the Prussians the previous year. The Russian infantry had started to reform their squares behind d'Hautpoul's men. During this charge, d'Hautpoul was struck by artillery grapeshot and badly wounded. Several <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> managed to carry or drag him back to French lines.|$|E
5|$|Blackfish {{wanted to}} {{continue}} to Boonesborough and capture it, since it was now poorly defended, but Boone convinced him that {{the women and children}} were not hardy enough to survive a winter trek. Instead, Boone promised that Boonesborough would surrender willingly to the Shawnees the following spring. Boone did not have an opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.|$|E

[...] asked Walter, who had been {{studying}} them closely, hoping to find out for himself the clue which made Pat so sure <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>man,</b> but unable to see anything distinctive save that they were of odd shape, being nearly round.|$|R
60|$|Now the {{ambassador}} de Ayala broke in, claiming satisfaction {{for the killing}} <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>man,</b> for he was still very angry, and saying {{that if it were}} not given, he would report the matter to their Majesties of Spain, and let them know how their servants were treated in London.|$|R

5|$|By 622, Heraclius {{was ready}} to mount a counter-offensive. He left Constantinople the day after celebrating Easter on Sunday, 4 April 622. His young son, Heraclius Constantine, was left behind as regent under the charge of Patriarch Sergius and the patrician Bonus. He spent the summer {{training}} to improve the skills <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> and his own generalship. In the autumn, Heraclius threatened Persian communications from the Euphrates valley to Anatolia by marching to Cappadocia. This forced the Persian forces in Anatolia under Shahrbaraz to retreat from the front-lines of Bithynia and Galatia to eastern Anatolia in order to block his access to Persia.|$|E
5|$|By March, however, Brooks' {{unit had}} grown to 110 men and he was {{promoted}} to Second Lieutenant and put in charge of a band of 40 soldiers, including Duncan. His guerrilla activities expanded to include larger raids, reprisal attacks, and the assassination of more important members of the Nazi regime. He would later earn the Polish Cross of Valor for helping lead over 100 <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men</b> out of a German encirclement to safety without a single casualty. He {{made his way to the}} Russian front line in January 1945, and was eventually transferred from Lviv to Odessa, Port Said, Cairo, and finally London, where he arrived in March 1945.|$|E

The Courier must also enter Oliver's {{compound}} where they have the choice to either convince him to retreat for the sake <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>men,</b> or they can kill him. The Legion seizes Hoover Dam, forcing the NCR to retreat, allowing Caesar's Legion to gain control over New Vegas and the Mojave Wasteland.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to his books, Campbell also wrote a column for X Ray Magazine in 2001, an issue of the popular comic series The Hire, and comic book adaptations <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>Man</b> with the Screaming Brain. Most recently he wrote the introduction to Josh Becker's The Complete Guide to Low-Budget Feature Filmmaking.|$|R
6000|$|When {{it came to}} the cross-examination, however, matters {{began to}} assume quite a {{different}} complexion. The prisoner set out by questioning Sir Charles's identifications.
