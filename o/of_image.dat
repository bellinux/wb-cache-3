5|$|Network {{synthesis}} filters. The mathematical {{bases of}} network synthesis were {{laid in the}} 1930s and 1940s. After the end of World War II network synthesis became the primary tool of filter design. Network synthesis put filter design on a firm mathematical foundation, freeing it from the mathematically sloppy techniques <b>of</b> <b>image</b> design and severing the connection with physical lines. The essence of network synthesis is that it produces a design that will (at least if implemented with ideal components) accurately reproduce the response originally specified in black box terms.|$|E

5|$|Several L-shape half-sections may be {{cascaded}} to form {{a composite}} filter. Like impedance must always face like in these combinations. There are therefore two circuits that can be formed with two identical L-shaped half-sections. Where a port <b>of</b> <b>image</b> impedance ZiT faces another ZiT, the section is called a Π section. Where ZiΠ faces ZiΠ the section so formed is a T section. Further additions of half-sections to either of these section forms a ladder network which may start and end with series or shunt elements.|$|E
5|$|The plots shown <b>of</b> <b>image</b> impedance, {{attenuation}} and {{phase change}} are the plots of a low-pass prototype filter section. The prototype has a cut-off frequency of ωc = 1 rad/s and a nominal impedance R0 = 1 Ω. This {{is produced by}} a filter half-section where L = 1 henry and C = 1 farad. This prototype can be impedance scaled and frequency scaled to the desired values. The low-pass prototype can also be transformed into high-pass, band-pass or band-stop types by application of suitable frequency transformations.|$|E

60|$|In {{the second}} place, the {{question}} arises as to whether we can be conscious <b>of</b> <b>images.</b> If we apply our definition to this case, it seems to demand <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>images.</b> In order, for example, to be conscious <b>of</b> an <b>image</b> <b>of</b> a cat, we shall require, according to {{the letter of the}} definition, an image which is a copy <b>of</b> our <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the cat, and has this image for its prototype. Now, it hardly seems probable, as a matter of observation, that there are <b>images</b> <b>of</b> <b>images,</b> as opposed to <b>images</b> <b>of</b> sensations. We may meet this difficulty in two ways, either by boldly denying consciousness <b>of</b> <b>images,</b> or by finding a sense in which, by means of a different accompanying belief, an <b>image,</b> instead <b>of</b> meaning its prototype, can mean another <b>image</b> <b>of</b> the same prototype.|$|R
