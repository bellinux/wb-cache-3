[...] He concluded in his mixed review of the album, [...] "Of course, consistency isn't so important when an album is assembled {{as a series of}} singles rather than a cohesive work. Fortunately for Carey, the tabloid-tailored real-life back story {{on one side and the}} producer's craft on the other matter more than the art of singing in this particular fairy tale." [...] Ben Ratliff of The New York Times felt the album didn't level up to par with Carey's previous release, writing [...] "Much of the record sounds like urban-radio imitations, without the peculiarities and effective hooks of 'Mimi'. Maybe emancipation isn't a continuing procedure; maybe it only comes once." [...] Writing for PopMatters, Evan Sawdey rated E=MC² four out of ten discs, describing it as a [...] "shallow imitation of its predecessor". Sawdey concluded his review on a mixed note, stating [...] " [...] the second act of Mariah's comeback doesn't wisely expand her sound: it instead succumbs to the blueprint so carefully laid out by its predecessor, a pointless remake that exists only because it has to. If you ever had a doubt as to its formulaic nature, you need to look no further than its title. Long live the Diva." [...] Caryn Ganz from Rolling Stone questioned why she limited her vocal abilities throughout the record, [...] "nearly every song confines Carey to four-note verses, offering little room for her glorious range." [...] Journalist Eric Henderson, writing for Slant Magazine, graded the album three out of five stars, and concluding with, [...] "Such are the rewards of an album like 'E=MC²', in which one does reach a solution, but not before Mariah bends <b>over</b> <b>backward</b> to show her work." [...] The album finished in the top-ten of several [...] "best of 2008" [...] lists, ending at number four on an official poll held by Billboard, eight by The Detroit News, and number ten by The San Diego Union-Tribune.

40|$|The flow <b>over</b> a <b>{{backward}}</b> facing step is {{a classic}} problem in applied aerodynamics. Among many other applications, backward facing steps are often used for ignition and stabilization of the flame in a scramjet engine. In this study, the steady two-dimensional viscous supersonic turbulent flow <b>over</b> a <b>backward</b> facing step was calculated using FLUENT. The one-equation Spalart and Allmaras turbulence model was employed for the turbulent flow simulation. The free stream Mach number was 2. The simulated flow field is in good qualitative agreement with flow visualizations, pressure and temperature measurements and theoretical predictions. The boundary layer ahead of the step turns through the right angle over the corner. Then a separation occurs below the corner on the step wall. The numerical {{results indicate that the}} separation point is positioned on the step face, below the corner. The overexpansion at the corner is balanced by a lip-shock. This phenomenon was observed in experimental measurements, in flow visualizations and is also obtained in the present numerical calculation...|$|R
