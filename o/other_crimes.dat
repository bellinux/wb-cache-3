5|$|At a {{press conference}} in September 1985, Rajneesh accused several of his {{followers}} of participation in this and <b>other</b> <b>crimes,</b> including an aborted plan in 1985 to assassinate a United States Attorney, and he asked State and Federal authorities to investigate. Oregon Attorney General David B. Frohnmayer set up an Interagency Task Force, composed of Oregon State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and executed search warrants in Rajneeshpuram. A sample of bacteria matching the contaminant that had sickened the town residents was found in a Rajneeshpuram medical laboratory. Two leading Rajneeshpuram officials were convicted on charges of attempted murder and served 29months of 20-year sentences in a minimum-security federal prison.|$|E

A similar explosive had detonated 50 minutes earlier at King's Cross. The Metropolitan Police had received a three-minute warning and were unable to evacuate the station completely, but British Transport Police evacuated much of the area just before the explosion. In 1974, the mentally ill Judith Ward confessed to the bombing and was convicted of this and <b>other</b> <b>crimes</b> despite the evidence against her being highly suspect and Ward retracting her confessions. She was acquitted in 1992, and the culprit has not been found.|$|E

5|$|Lithium {{was first}} {{detected}} in human organs and fetal tissues {{in the late}} 19th century. In humans there are no defined lithium deficiency diseases, but low lithium intakes from water supplies were associated with increased rates of suicides, homicides and the arrest rates for drug use and <b>other</b> <b>crimes.</b> The biochemical mechanisms of action of lithium appear to be multifactorial and are intercorrelated with the functions of several enzymes, hormones and vitamins, {{as well as with}} growth and transforming factors. Evidence now appears to be sufficient to accept lithium as essential; a provisional RDA of 1,000µg/day is suggested for a 70kg adult.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 1985, Congressman James H. Weaver gave {{a speech}} in the United States House of Representatives in which he {{asserted}} that the Rajneeshees {{were involved in the}} bioterror attack in Oregon. At a series of press conferences in September 1985, Rajneesh accused several of his recently departed lieutenants of involvement in this and <b>other</b> <b>crimes,</b> including the poisoning of Mike Sullivan, a Jefferson County district attorney, and asked state and federal authorities to investigate his allegations. The assassination plot was uncovered by federal law enforcement {{as a result of the}} ensuing investigation into activities at Rajneeshpuram. Turner was never physically harmed, and had retired by 1995.|$|E
5|$|However, Kalt {{argues that}} the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial {{strategies}} that would at least partially close this loophole. First, the government {{might be able to}} charge <b>other</b> <b>crimes</b> that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere). Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less, to which the jury right does not attach. Third, the Clause might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime. Fourth, the government might argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause. Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.|$|E

5|$|In 2010, the Serbian War Crimes Prosecutor's Office {{investigated}} Borislav Pelević, {{a former}} SDG member {{and a member}} of the Serbian National Assembly. The investigation was ultimately dropped due to lack of evidence. In 2012, former SDG member Srđan Golubović was arrested in Belgrade at the request of the Prosecutor's Office. Golubović was charged with an indictment listing the names of 78 victims. Clint Williamson, the lead prosecutor, said that other members of the SDG could not be identified because their faces had been covered with masks. As of October 2014, closing arguments had been concluded in the trial of Karadžić, the former President of Republika Srpska, for the massacre, and <b>other</b> <b>crimes</b> against humanity committed in Bijeljina, among other areas, as well as for the genocide at Srebrenica. The ICTY is expected to deliver judgment in Karadžić's case in the first quarter of 2016.|$|E
5|$|Marjorie Bowen's 1929 novel Dickon set {{the trend}} for pro-Ricardian literature. Particularly {{influential}} was The Daughter of Time (1951) by Josephine Tey. {{in which a}} modern detective concludes that Richard III is innocent {{in the death of}} the Princes. Other novelists such as Valerie Anand in the novel Crown of Roses (1989) have also offered alternative versions to the theory that he murdered them. Sharon Kay Penman, in her historical novel The Sunne in Splendour, attributes the death of the Princes to the Duke of Buckingham. In the mystery novel The Murders of Richard III by Elizabeth Peters (1974) the central plot revolves around the debate as to whether Richard III was guilty of these and <b>other</b> <b>crimes.</b> A sympathetic portrayal of Richard III is given in The Founding, the first volume in The Morland Dynasty series by Cynthia Harrod-Eagles.|$|E
5|$|The Red Army {{initiated}} {{an offensive}} into East Prussia in October 1944, {{but it was}} temporarily driven back two weeks later. After that, the German Ministry of Propaganda reported that war crimes {{had taken place in}} East Prussian villages, in particular in Nemmersdorf, where inhabitants had been raped and killed by the advancing Soviets. Since the Nazi war effort had largely stripped the civil population of able-bodied men for service in the military, the victims of the atrocity were primarily old men, women, and children. Upon the Soviet withdrawal from the area, German authorities sent in film crews to document what had happened, and invited foreign observers as further witnesses. A documentary film from the footage obtained during this effort was put together and shown in cinemas in East Prussia, with the intention of fanaticising civilian and military resolve in resisting the Soviets. A Nazi information campaign about the atrocities at Nemmersdorf, as well as <b>other</b> <b>crimes</b> committed in East Prussia, convinced the remaining civilians that they should not get caught by the advancing enemy.|$|E
