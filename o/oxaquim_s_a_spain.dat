We modeled moviegoers’ choice of film by country of origin (U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.,</b> <b>Spain,</b> and other countries) according to a set of determinants: (1) consumers’ interpretation of several sources of information, (2) motivations and (3) choice rules.

Comparing to conventional fish oil extraction processes such as cold extraction, wet reduction or enzymatic extraction, supercritical fluid extraction with carbon dioxide under moderate conditions (25 MPa and 313 K) may be useful for reducing fish oil oxidation, especially when fish oil is rich in omega- 3 such as salmon oil, {{and the amount of}} certain impurities, such as some species of arsenic. Furthermore, taking profit of the advantages of supercritical carbon dioxide as extractive solvent, a coupled extraction-fractionation process is proposed as a way to remove free fatty acids and improve fish oil quality, alternatively to physical and chemical refining procedures.

In analogy with ecological systems, the simplest case of such models shows a kind of “competitive exclusion” principle. However, the inclusion of terms corresponding for instance to “company efficiency” or to (ecological) “intracompetition” shows that, if the associated parameter overcomes certain threshold values, the meaning of “strong” and “weak” companies should be redefined.

40|$|Schizosaccharomyces pombe rho 1 + is {{required}} for maintenance of cell integrity and polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. However, no other effector besides the (1, 3) Î²-D-glucan synthase enzyme has been identified in S. pombe. We have further investigated if rho 1 + signalling could be also mediated by the two protein kinase C homologues, pck 1 p and pck 2 p. We show {{in this study that}} both kinases interact with rho 1 p and rho 2 p only when bound to GTP, as most GTPase effecters do. Interestingly, the interaction was mapped in {{a different part of the}} proteins than in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pkc 1 p. Thus, active rho 1 p binds to the amino-terminal region of the pcks where two HR 1 motifs are located, and binding to the GTPase dramatically stabilizes the kinases. Detailed biochemical analysis suggests that pck 2 p is more important in the regulation of the enzyme (1 - 3) Î²-D-glucan synthase. Thus, overexpression of pck 2 +, but not pck 1 +, caused a general increase in cell wall biosynthesis, mainly in Î²-glucan, and (1 - 3) Î²-D-glucan synthase activity was considerably augmented. When this activity was separated into soluble and membrane fractions and reconstituted, the increase caused by pck 2 + overexpression was exclusively detected in the membrane component. We also show that both protein kinase C homologues are required for the maintenance of cell integrity. pck 1 Î” and pck 2 Î” strains present a number of defects related to the cell wall, indicating that this structure might be co-ordinately regulated by both kinases. In addition, pck 2 p, but not pck 1 p, seems to be involved in keeping cell polarity. Genetic evidence indicates that both pck 1 + and pck 2 + interact with cps 1 + and gls 2 +, two genes similar to S. cerevisiae FKS 1 and FKS 2 that encode membrane subunits of the (1 - 3) Î²-D-glucan synthase, pck 1 + also showed a genetic interaction with ras 1 + and ral 1 + suggesting the existence of a functional link between both signalling pathways.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the concept {{as well as}} first results of the EU-MOP ("Elimination Units for Marine Oil Pollutions") project (1). The basic idea of this project is a swarm out of autonomous marine robots which are able to recover oil {{with the help of}} oil skimmers. In order to achieve a flexible and robust system, the swarm intelligence approach has been used as control paradigm for the EU-MOP robots. A robotic swarm is a homogeneous group of identical robots without any hierarchies, whose individuals interact directly or indirectly {{with each other and with}} the environment. For this interaction sensors play a major role, thus the use of sensors for robotics swarms will be examined with the help of a simulation. Furthermore a method for the evaluation of swarms in comparison to single robot systems will be presented.

Amphotericin B, itraconazole, and echinocandins showed poor activity against Paecilomyces lilacinus, {{while the new}} triazoles were active against it. Paecilomyces variotii exhibited a different susceptibility pattern, being susceptible to most antifungal agents apart from voriconazole and ravuconazole. Paecilomyces species are saprophytic filamentous fungi that are found worldwide in soil and as air and water contaminants (9, 13). Among species in this genus, Paecilomyces lilacinus and Paecilomyces variotii are of clinical importance, as they are an increasing cause for opportunistic and usually severe human infections (2, 4, 5, 15) generally {{associated with the use}} of immunosuppression therapy, implants, or ocular surgery. The differentiation between these two species is clinically important, since P. lilacinus and P. variotii seem to present marked differences in their in vitro susceptibilities to the anti-fungal agents.

Moreover, F. proliferatum is known to produce a range of toxins, including fumonisin B 1, moniliformin, beauvericin, fusaproliferin and fusaric acid, which are implicated in pathogenesis. In this study six randomly selected F. proliferatum isolates from garlic were tested for pathogenicity and screened for fusaric acid production. Healthy seedlings of onion (Allium cepa), leek (A. porrum) and chives (A. schoenoprasum) and garlic clones (A. sativum) were inoculated. Onion seedlings and garlic clones were soaked in the conidial suspensions of each F. proliferatum isolate for 24 h and then planted in flats containing soil previously inoculated with the same isolate of F. proliferatum. Plants were maintained in a temperature and light-controlled greenhouse (12 h/ 12 h light/dark; 25 / 21 °C). The root and bulb/clove rot disease symptoms were graded into five classes following the method of Stankovick et al. (2007). A disease severity index (DSI) was calculated as the mean of three plants of each species and four test replicates. Symptoms on onion and garlic plants were observed three weeks after inoculation.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to study the ability of NIR {{spectroscopy}} to determine oak volatile compounds and ethylphenols levels in aged red wines. For this purpose 510 wines aged with different storage time and in different oak barrel types were analyzed. Calibration models were developed from SBSE-GC–MS and NIR data using partial least squares (PLS) regression. In order to validate the calibration, full cross validation was employed. Results showed that the calibration statistics were very good (R 2 > 0. 86) for all the compounds studied. In wines aged in French and in American and French oak barrels, and in “reserva” and “gran reserva” wines, the residual predictive deviation (RPD) obtained was higher than 1. 5 in all the compounds and it was higher than 2 {{in some of the}} cases.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} impact of the application of several fungicide treatments used in Spanish vines on Aspergillus carbonarius growth and ochratoxin A production. Three trials were designed in order: (1) to screen 26 fungicides at the doses recommended by manufacturers on grape-like synthetic medium at 20 and 30 C; (2) to find out the minimum inhibitory concentration of each fungicide for A. carbonarius growth on synthetic medium; and (3) to investigate the effect of several fungicides on A. carbonariu s-inoculated grapes. In synthetic medium nine fungicides significantly reduced A. carbonarius growth rate. Meanwhile, 13 fungicides completely inhibited its growth. In general, growth was faster at 30 C than at 20 C, contrary to ochratoxin A production. Fungicides that stopped fungal growth also inhibited ochratoxin A production, but not all the fungicides that reduced growth reduced the ochratoxin A synthesis. In general, fungicides that contained copper or strobilurins reduced both growth and ochratoxin A production, contrary to sulphur fungicides. At the optimum temperature for A. carbonarius growth of 30 C, higher amounts of fungicide were needed to prevent fungal growth than at 20 C. Among the fungicides that inhibited A. carbonarius growth on synthetic medium at the initial doses, cyprodinil seemed to be the active ingredient more effective at stopping fungal growth when testing reduced doses. The fungicide effect on grapes was similar to that on synthetic medium. Both infection and ochratoxin A production were reduced when using cyprodinil (37. 5 %) plus fludioxonil (25 %) and azoxystrobin (25 %). Penconazole (10 %) also showed a clear reduction in ochratoxin A production at both temperatures, although infection was only reduced at 20 C. Ochratoxin A reduction was strain and temperature-dependent. In general, fenhexamid (50 %), mancozeb (80 %) and copper hydroxide (80 %) plus copper (50 %) enhanced infection and ochratoxin A production.

Extruded CNT/SBS composites show percolation thresholds around 5 wt%, electro-mechanical properties with high sensibility at larger strain and the gauge factor reach values up to 30 at strains of 20 %. The butadiene/styrene ratio has influence in the mechanical and electro-mechanical properties. In one hand, the increase of the styrene content in copolymer increasing initial mechanical modulus, on the other hand, the increase of the butadiene content leads to larger maximum deformations and higher electro-mechanical sensibility for strains up to 20 %. Further, applied initial pre-stress increases the electro-mechanical sensibility of the composites.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} of {{lubricating greases}} greatly conditions their in-service performance. In that sense, optimal testing protocols are required {{in order to}} accomplish their correct morphological characterization. This study explores and compares the suitability of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques for imaging six different commercial metallic soap-based greases and two novel biopolymer-based formulations. Pros and cons of both techniques and the effect of sample preparation protocol were analysed. The results revealed a wide variety of morphological characteristics depending on composition. Thus, the four anhydrous calcium-based greases demonstrated two clearly distinct microstructures (fibrous and granular) determined by the type of base oil employed. With regard to the lithium complex greases, the typically reported microstructure characterized by well-defined entangled and fibrous network was observed in both AFM and SEM techniques. As for the two biopolymer-based greases, fibre networks were also encountered. Besides this, selected greases were subjected to different tribological tests, and the effect of high-shear frictional working treatments on their microstructure was also analysed. As a result of the friction and internal wear, the AFM results evidenced microstructural changes which depended on grease composition. Overall, the combined use of AFM and SEM techniques was demonstrated to be a powerful approach to microstructurally characterize lubricating greases.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{specific}} {{attributes of}} inhaler devices can influence patient use, satisfaction and treatment compliance, and may ultimately impact on clinical outcomes {{in patients with}} {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). AIMS: To assess patient preference, satisfaction and critical inhaler technique errors with Genuair (a multidose inhaler) and Breezhaler (a single-dose inhaler) after 2 weeks of daily use. METHODS: Patients with COPD and moderate to severe airflow obstruction were randomised in a cross-over, open-label, multicentre study to consecutive once-daily inhalations of placebo via Genuair and Breezhaler, in addition to current COPD medication. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who preferred Genuair versus Breezhaler after 2 weeks (Patient Satisfaction and Preference Questionnaire). Other end points included overall satisfaction and correct use of the inhalers after 2 weeks, and willingness to continue with each device. RESULTS: Of the 128 patients enrolled, 127 were included in the safety population (male n= 91; mean age 67. 6 years). Of the 110 of the 123 patients in the intent-to-treat population who indicated an inhaler preference, statistically significantly more patients preferred Genuair than Breezhaler (72. 7 vs. 27. 3 %; P< 0. 001). Mean overall satisfaction scores were also greater for Genuair than for Breezhaler (5. 9 vs. 5. 3, respectively; P< 0. 001). After 2 weeks, there was no statistically significant difference in the number of patients who made ⩾ 1 critical inhaler technique error with Breezhaler than with Genuair (7. 3 vs. 3. 3 %, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Patient overall preference and satisfaction was significantly higher with Genuair compared with Breezhaler. The proportion of patients making critical inhaler technique errors was low with Genuair and Breezhaler.

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the vertical misfit between different brands of dental implants and prosthetic abutments, {{with or without}} mechanical torque, and to study their possible combination. Study design: Five different brands of implant {{were used in the}} study: Biofit (Castemaggiore, Italy), Bioner <b>S.</b> <b>A.</b> (Barcelona, <b>Spain),</b> 3 i Biomet (Palm Beach, U. <b>S.</b> <b>A.),</b> BTI (Alava, <b>Spain)</b> and Nobel Biocare (Göteborg, Sweden), with standard 4. 1 mm heads and external hexagons, and their respective machined prosthetic abutments. The implant-to- abutment fit/misfit was evaluated at four points (vestibular, lingual/palatine, mesial and distal) between implants and abutments of the same brand and different brands, with or without mechanical torque, using SEM micrographs at 5000 X. Image analysis was performed using NIS-Elements software (Nikon Instruments Europe B. V.). Results: Before applying torque, vertical misfit (microgaps) of the different combinations tested varied between 1. 6 and 5. 4 microns and after applying torque, between 0. 9 and 5. 9 microns, an overall average of 3. 46 ± 2. 96 microns. For manual assembly without the use of mechanical torque, the best results were obtained with the com - bination of the 3 i implant and the BTI abutment. The Nobel implant and Nobel abutment, 3 i- 3 i and BTI-BTI and the combination of 3 i implant with BTI or Nobel abutment provided the best vertical fit when mechanical torque was applied. Conclusions: The vertical fits obtained were within the limits considered clinically acceptable. The application of mechanical torque improved outcomes. There is compatibility between implants and abutments of different brand and so their combination is a clinical possibility...|$|R

40|$|As part of {{our project}} devoted {{to the search for}} {{antifungal}} agents, which act via a selective mode of action, we synthesized a series of new 4 - aryl- or 4 -alkyl-N-arylamine- 1 -butenes and transformed some of them into 2 - substituted 4 -methyl-tetrahydroquinolines and quinolines by using a novel three-step synthesis. Results obtained in agar dilution assays have shown that 4 -aryl homoallylamines not possessing halogen in their structures, tetrahydroquinolines and quinolines, display a range of antifungal properties in particular against Epidermophyton floccosum and Microsporum canis. Regarding the mode of action, all active compounds showed in vitro inhibitory activities against β(1 - 3) glucan-synthase and mainly against chitin- synthase. These enzymes catalyze the synthesis of β(1 - 3) glucan and chitin, respectively, major polymers of the fungal cell wall. Since fungal but not mammalian cells are encased in a cell wall, its inhibition may represent a useful mode of action for these antifungal compounds. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|In recent years, much {{attention}} has been given to different marine organisms, namely as potential sources of valuable materials with a vast range of properties and characteristics. In this work, β-chitin was isolated from the endoskeleton of the giant squid Dosidicus gigas and further deacetylated to produce chitosan. Then, the squid chitosan was processed into membranes and scaffolds using solvent casting and freeze-drying, respectively, to assess their potential biomedical application. The developed membranes have shown to be stiffer and less hydrophobic than those obtained with commercial chitosan. On the other hand, the morphological characterization of the developed scaffolds, by SEM and micro-computed tomography, revealed that the matrices were formed with a lamellar structure. The findings also indicated that the treatment with ethanol prior to neutralization with sodium hydroxide caused the formation of larger pores and loss of some lamellar features. The in vitro cell culture study has shown that all chitosan scaffolds exhibited a non-cytotoxic effect over the mouse fibroblast-like cell line, L 929 cells.

They inhibited at low micromolar concentrations the oxidative damage and the death induced by exposure to hydrogen peroxide. These heteroarylnitrones showed excellent peroxyl free radical absorbance capacities, analyzed by oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assay with fluorescein as the fluorescent probe, ranging from 1. 5 - to 16. 5 -fold {{the value of the}} reference nitrone, R-phenyl-N-tert-butylnitrone (PBN). The electron spin resonance spectroscopy (ESR) demonstrated the ability of these derivatives to directly trap and stabilize oxygen, carbon, and sulfur-centered free radicals. These results demonstrated the potential use of these heteroarylnitrones as neuroprotective agents in preventing the death of cells exposed to enhanced oxidative stress and damage.

The compounds were prepared by reaction of 3, 4, 5 -triamino- 1, 2, 6 -thiadiazine 1, 1 - dioxide with suitable 1, 2 -dicarbonyl compounds or R-hydroxyiminoketones and subsequent N-alkylation. A transamination procedure for synthesizing derivatives with different substituents at the 4 -amino group is reported for the first time. The pyrazino[2, 3 -c][1, 2, 6]thiadiazine derivatives were screened for tracheal relaxing activity in vitro, and the active compounds were evaluated in vivo in guinea pigs as bronchodilator agents in comparison to theophylline. Among the compounds studied, the most interesting properties were displayed by the 4 -amino- 1 -ethyl- 6 -methyl derivative (21). The toxicological evaluation of this derivative is also reported.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) women undergoing IVF-ET were treated with myo-inositol combined with d-chiro-inositol in the physiological ratio (1. 1 g myo-inositol plus 27. 6 mg of d-chiro-inositol; INOFOLICA (R) combi Lo.

The data clearly showed that only the combined therapy was able to improve oocyte and embryo quality, as well as pregnancy rates, in PCOS women undergoing IVF-ET. The present paper further supports the hypothesis that MI plays {{a crucial role in the}} ovary in PCOS women.

40|$|Background: Data {{on which}} to base {{definitive}} recommendations on the doses and duration of therapy for genotype 3 HCV/HIV-coinfected patients are scarce. We evaluated the efficacy of a lower peginterferon-α 2 a dose and a shorter duration of therapy than the current standard of care in genotype 3 HCV/HIV-coinfected patients. Methods and Findings: Pilot, open-label, single arm clinical trial which involved 58 Caucasian HCV/HIV-coinfected patients who received weekly 135 μg peginterferon-α 2 a plus ribavirin 400 mg twice daily during 20 weeks after attaining undetectable viremia. The relationships between baseline patient-related variables, including IL 28 B genotype, plasma HCV-RNA, ribavirin dose/kg, peginterferon-α 2 a and ribavirin levels with virological responses were analyzed. Only 4 patients showed lack of response and 5 patients dropped out due to adverse events related to the study medication. Overall, sustained virologic response (SVR) rates were 58. 3 % by intention-to-treat and 71. 4 % by per protocol analysis, respectively. Among patients with rapid virologic response (RVR), SVR and relapses rates were 92. 6 % and 7. 4 %, respectively. No relationships were observed between viral responses and ribavirin dose/kg, peginterferon-α 2 a concentrations, ribavirin levels or rs 129679860 genotype. Conclusions: Weekly 135 μg pegIFN-α 2 a could be as effective as the standard 180 μg dose, with a very low incidence of severe adverse events. A 24 -week treatment duration appears to be appropriate in patients achieving RVR, but extending treatment up to just 20 weeks beyond negativization of viremia is associated with a high relapse rate in those patients not achieving RVR. There was no influence of IL 28 B genotype on the virological responses. © 2012 López-Cortés et al.

40|$|Drugs {{with poor}} lipid and water {{solubility}} {{are some of}} the most challenging to formulate in nanocarriers, typically resulting in low encapsulation efficiencies and uncontrolled release profiles. PEGylated nano- capsules (PEG-NC) are known for their amenability to diverse modifications that allow the formation of domains with different physicochemical properties, an interesting feature to address a drug encapsulation problem. We explored this problem by encapsulating in PEG-NC the promising anticancer drug candidate F 10320 GD 1, used herein as a model for compounds with such characteristics. The nanocarriers were pre- pared from Miglyol®, lecithin and PEG-sterate through a solvent displacement technique. The resulting system was a homogeneous suspension of particles with size around 200 nm. F 10320 GD 1 encapsulation was found to be very poor (< 15 %) if PEG-NC were prepared using water as continuous phase; but we were able to improve this value to 85 % by fixing the pH of the continuous phase to 9. Interestingly, this modification also improved the controlled release properties and the chemical stability of the formulation during storage. These differences in pharmaceutical properties together with physicochemical data sug- gest that the pH of the continuous phase used for PEG-NC preparation can modify drug allocation, from the external shell towards the inner lipid core of the nanocapsules. Finally, we tested the bioactivity of the drug-loaded PEG-NC in several tumor cell lines, and also in endothelial cells. The results indicated that drug encapsulation led to an improvement on drug cytotoxicity in tumor cells, but not in non-tumor en- dothelial cells. Altogether, the data confirms that PEG-NC show adequate delivery properties for F 10320 GD 1, and underlines its possible utility as an anticancer therapy.

40|$|The Schizosaccharomyces pombe mutant ehs 1 - 1 mutant was {{isolated}} {{on the basis}} of its hypersensitivity to Echinocandin and Calcofluor White, which inhibit cell wall synthesis. The mutant shows a thermosensitive growth phenotype that is suppressed in the presence of an osmotic stabiliser. The mutant also showed other cell wall-associated phenotypes, such as enhanced sensitivity to enzymatic cell wall degradation and an imbalance in polysaccharide synthesis. The ehs 1 + gene encodes a predicted integral membrane protein that is 30 % identical to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Midlp, a protein that has been proposed to form part of a calcium channel. As expected for such a function, we found that ehs 1 + is involved in intracellular Ca 2 + accumulation. High external Ca 2 + concentrations suppressed all phenotypes associated with the ehs 1 null mutation, suggesting that the cell integrity defects of ehs 1 mutants result from inadequate levels of calcium in the cell. We observed a genetic relationship between ehs 1 + and the protein kinase C homologue pck 2 +. pck 2 + suppressed all phenotypes of ehs 1 - 1 mutant cells. Overproduction of pck 2 p is deleterious to wild-type cells, increasing 1, 3 -β-D-glucan synthase activity and promoting accumulation of extremely high levels of Ca 2 +. The lethality associated with pck 2 p, the increase in 1, 3 -β-D-glucan synthase production and the strong Ca 2 + accumulation are all dependent on the presence of ehs 1 p. Our results suggest that in fission yeast ehs 1 p forms part of a calcium channel that is involved in the cell wall integrity pathway that includes the kinase pck 2 p. H.

40|$|The Schizosaccharomyces pombe rho 1 p GTPase {{directly}} activates the (1 - 3) beta-D-glucan synthase and {{participates in}} the regulation of cell wall growth and morphogenesis in this fission yeast. Indirect immunofluorescence experiments using rho 1 p tagged with hemagglutinin have revealed that rho 1 p was located at the growing tips during interphase and at the septum prior to cytokinesis, localising to the same areas as actin patches. In S. pombe cdc 10 - 129 mutant cells, arrested in G 1, HA-rho 1 p accumulates at one tip whereas in cdc 25 - 22 mutants, arrested in G 2, HA-rho 1 p accumulates at both tips. In tea 1 - 1 and tea 2 - 1 cdc 11 - 119 mutant cells, HA-rho 1 p is localised to the new growing tips. Overexpression of different rho 1 mutant alleles caused different effects on cortical actin patch distribution, (1 - 3) beta-D-glucan synthase activation, and sensitivity to cell wall specific antifungal drugs. These results indicate that multiple cellular components are activated by rho 1 p. Overexpression of the dominant negative rho 1 T 20 N allele was lethal as was the rho 1 + deletion. Moreover, when rho 1 + expression was repressed in actively growing S. pombe, cells died in about 10 to 12 hours. Under these conditions, normal cell morphology was maintained but the level of (1 - 3) beta-D-glucan synthase activity decreased and the actin patches disappeared. Most cells lysed after cytokinesis {{during the process of}} separation, and lysis was not prevented by an osmotic stabiliser. We conclude that rho 1 p localisation is restricted to growth areas and regulated during the cell cycle and that rho 1 p is involved in cell wall growth and actin cytoskeleton organisation in S. pombe.

40|$|Thermoplastic {{elastomer}} tri-block copolymer, namely styrene–butadiene–styrene (SBS) composites {{filled with}} carbon nanotubes (CNT) are characterized {{with the main}} goal of obtaining electro-mechanical composites suitable for large deformation sensor applications. CNT/SBS composites with different filler contents and filler functionalizations are studied by morphological, thermal, mechanical and electrical analyses. It is shown that the different dispersion levels of CNT in the SBS matrix are achieved for pristine or functionalized CNT with strong influence in the electrical properties of the composites. In particular covalently functionalized CNTs show percolation thresholds higher than 8 weight percentage (wt%) whereas pristine CNT show percolation threshold smaller than 1 wt%. On the other hand, CNT functionalization does not alter the conduction mechanism which is related to hopping between the CNT for concentrations higher than the percolation threshold. Pristine single and multiwall CNT within the SBS matrix allow the preparation of composites with electro-mechanical properties appropriate for strain sensors for deformations up to 5 % of strain, the gauge factor varying between 2 and 8. Composites close to the percolation threshold show larger values of the gauge factor.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{puncturing}} settings (crosshead speed and punch cross-section) on the crust mechanical parameters was investigated using breads with two different crust thickness. Results showed that, greater punch cross-section was associated to compression behavior, which reduced the sensibility to detect changes in the crust structure. Moreover, low crosshead speed (0. 5 mm/s) puncture test provided information about the cellular structure of the crust. The relationship between the puncturing parameters and the water activity and moisture content together with the crust microstructure analysis revealed that for obtaining reliable information about the structural ruptures related to crispiness texture, {{it is necessary to}} use low crosshead speeds (0. 5 mm/s) and low punch cross-section (3 mm 2). Crust microstructure observations indicate that the crust layers and {{the size and shape of}} the air cells are responsible of the puncturing behavior. Practical Applications: Texture of the bread crust is an important parameter used to define the quality of crispy breads and their freshness. Consequently, the extension of crust crispiness is still a priority for the baking industry. Different methods have been proposed for assessing the mechanical properties of the bread crust, although punching is a common feature in all of them. However, there is no information about the incidence of punching settings on the bread crust mechanical parameters. Water activity and moisture content of the crust, besides scanning electron microscopy of the crust section, were used to confirm the reliability of the mechanical parameters. The study allows defining the best conditions to study the crust's mechanical properties providing information about the internal cell structure. Results could be very useful at research level and also for the baking industry when investigating crust freshness. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. financial support of Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (Project AGL 2008 - 00092 /ALI and AGL 2011 - 23802) and the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC).
