50|$|In optical engineering, the {{objective}} is the optical element that gathers light from the object being observed and focuses the light rays to produce a real image. Objectives can be a single lens or mirror, or combinations of several optical elements. They are used in microscopes, telescopes, cameras, slide projectors, CD players and many other optical instruments. Objectives are also called <b>object</b> <b>lenses,</b> <b>object</b> glasses, or objective glasses.|$|R

The blank for the mirror was cast by Georges Despret, director of the Jeumont glassworks in northern France. The lens blanks were cast by Édouard Mantois (1848-1900) and ground by Gautier.

50|$|It {{is often}} {{questioned}} if the word-learning constraints {{are specific to}} the domain of language, or if they apply to other cognitive domains. As for the whole object assumption, there is a multitude of evidence suggesting {{that the idea of}} objects is more advantaged than characteristics or relations. Children assume a label refers to a whole object because the object is more salient than its properties. This being the case, the whole object assumption may reflect non-linguistic levels of an object and exploits the cognitive tendency to analyze the world through a whole <b>object</b> <b>lens.</b> The whole object assumption can therefore be applied to various cognitive domains outside of language.|$|E
50|$|Starting around 1826, James South {{made plans}} for a new, larger telescope, an equatorially mounted {{achromatic}} refractor (a telescope with a lens) in a new observatory. He bought a 12-inch (actually about 11.8) aperture lens from Robert-Aglaé Cauchoix in Paris for about 1000 pounds, {{large enough to be}} the biggest achromatic <b>object</b> <b>lens</b> in the world at the time. The telescope for the lens was completed, but dismantled around 1838. The next largest refractor, was at the Markree Observatory, which successfully completed a 13.3 inch refractor (also a Cauchoix of Paris lens) in the 1830s on a Thomas Grubb mount. The problem for James South's telescope was the equatorial mount.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the optics of the {{mammalian}} eye is to bring a clear image of the visual world onto the retina. Because of limited depth of field of the mammalian eye, an object at one distance from the eye might project a clear image, while an object either closer to or further from the eye will not. To make images clear for objects at different distances from the eye, its optical power needs to be changed. This is accomplished mainly by changing the curvature of the <b>lens.</b> For distant <b>objects,</b> the <b>lens</b> {{needs to be made}} flatter; for near <b>objects</b> the <b>lens</b> needs to be made thicker and more rounded.|$|R
50|$|Microlensing {{is based}} on the {{gravitational}} lens effect. A massive <b>object</b> (the <b>lens)</b> will bend the light of a bright background object (the source). This can generate multiple distorted, magnified, and brightened images of the background source.|$|R

50|$|The Leica S1 Pro is {{a scanner}} camera {{with a very}} high {{resolution}} (26 megapixels) for stationary use introduced in 1996.

The software for the S1 is a special SilverFast version, originally developed by LaserSoft Imaging for high-end scanners. Approximately 160 cameras were built and mostly sold to museums, archives and research institutes. Later on Leica introduced the S1 Highspeed with very quick scanning and the S1 Alpha with half the resolution to the market.|$|E
50|$|The {{composite}} {{image on}} the left is made out of five frames of different sunsets. None of the images is a mirage. Frames # 1 and # 2 could fool even a very experienced observer. They do look like a mock mirage of the setting Sun, but they are not. Frames #3 and # 4 are clearly not a mirage. Frame # 5 is not a mirage and not even a sunspot, it is a spider with the Sun as a background. The strange shapes of the Sun in this composite is due to vog and clouds.Numerous atmospheric effects, such as vog, clouds, smoke, smog and others could generate a mirage like appearance of an astronomical <b>object.</b> <b>Lens</b> flares and ghost images also might be responsible for a false mirage or a false green flash.|$|E
5000|$|The {{basic concept}} is to {{introduce}} a split element into a telescope's optical path so as to produce a double image. If one element is moved using a screw micrometer, precise angle measurements can be made. The simplest arrangement is to split the <b>object</b> <b>lens</b> in half, with one half fixed and the other attached to the micrometer screw and slid along the cut diameter. To measure {{the diameter of the}} sun, for example, the micrometer is first adjusted so that the two images of the solar disk coincide (the [...] "zero" [...] position where the split elements form essentially a single element). The micrometer is then adjusted so that diametrically opposite sides of the two images of the solar disk just touch each other. The difference in the two micrometer readings so obtained is the (angular) diameter of the sun. Similarly, a precise measurement of the apparent separation between two nearby stars, A and B, is made by first superimposing the two images of the stars and then adjusting the double image so that star A in one image coincides with star B in the other. The difference in the two micrometer readings so obtained is the apparent separation or angular distance between the two stars.|$|E

40|$|A {{process model}} is {{described}} for reconstructing an individual's knowledge during {{the research and}} development of new technology by using six-lens interaction activities and management actions promoting it. It has a nested, or transformational, structure and three stages: awareness of issues, development of solutions, and “dialogical practice” of solutions. The second stage transcends and includes the first stage, and the third stage transcends and includes the first and second stages. Three interactions are evident in the third stage: between the subject lens and <b>object</b> <b>lens,</b> between the past lens and future lens, and between the analog lens and digital lens. The model was tested through a case study of a research team working for a Japanese electronics manufacturer. A modified grounded theory approach revealed five knowledge reconstruction factors, four lens functions for activating dialogical practice, and six management actions for promoting knowledge reconstruction. Two knowledge reconstruction factors are evident in the first stage: producing conflict and/or contradiction and resetting subject boundary. In addition, managers tend to create chaos in order to produce conflict and/or contradiction. Managers also tend to encourage heterogeneous information sharing, road-mapping, organizing and networking with other research and business teams, and assessing the potential of the technology in order to reset the subject boundary. Three additional knowledge reconstruction factors are evident in the second stage: expansion of viewing field, creation of new connection among technological concepts, and transformation of individual beliefs. Managers tend to present research goals abstractly to promote expansion of the viewing field. They also tend to encourage heterogeneous information sharing to promote the creation of new connection among technological concepts. All the knowledge reconstruction factors are evident in the third stage. In addition, an activation <b>object</b> <b>lens</b> comprising the team members and a past lens within future consciousness were evident. In contrast, the subject lens and digital lens had broken down. Managers tend to share heterogeneous information and expand the viewing field in order to activate the <b>object</b> <b>lens</b> comprising the research team colleagues.

40|$|This paper {{tries to}} make the case for a model of {{political}} identity based on an optical metaphor, which is especially applicable to nations. Human vision can be separated into sentient <b>object,</b> <b>lenses</b> and inbuilt mental ideas. This corresponds well to identity processes in which 'light' from a bounded territorial referent is refracted through various lenses (ideological, material, psychological) to focus in certain ways on particular symbolic resources like genealogy, history, culture or political institutions. Distinguishing between referent, lenses and resources helps us more precisely situate many hitherto disparate problems of national identity. These include the 'ethnic-civic' dilemma, the mystery of national identity before nationalism, and the relationship between local and national, and individual and collective, identities. The model also clarifies the place of universalist ideology, which currently fits poorly within the leading culturalist and materialist theories of nationalism...|$|R
40|$|Chinese Society of Astronautics (CAS) Compared with {{continuous}} zoom system, switch-zoom {{system has}} many advantages, such as simple structure, perfect imaging quality and easy fixing. A set of long focal length large-aperture visible switch-zoom {{system is designed}} in this paper. The system is composed of two parts: the front R-C <b>object</b> <b>lens</b> and the back switch-zoom system. When the back system is reversed, 1500 ∼ 3000 mm switch-zoom can be realized. In order to match the front R-C object lens' exit pupil with the back switch-zoom lens' entrance pupil, the front R-C <b>object</b> <b>lens</b> is controlled to be telecentric and the back switch-zoom system is telecentric at both image and object. The back switch-zoom system's object NA at short focal position is controlled to be equal to the front R-C object lens' image NA. Thus, the two parts can match with each other properly and the whole long focal length large-aperture visible switch-zoom system is designed. When the spatial frequency is 50 lp/mm, the MTF of the R-C system and the back switch-zoom system are reaching to the diffraction limit to ensure the MTF of the whole system at both long focal position and short focal position. The RMS at each focal position is less than 10 um. From the first surface to image plane, the overall length is 1100 mm.
