2500|$|Following the split, the {{remnants}} of the Irish Volunteers were often, and erroneously, referred to as the [...] "Sinn Féin Volunteers", or, by the British press, derisively as [...] "Shinners", after Arthur Griffith's political organisation Sinn Féin. Although the two organisations had some <b>overlapping</b> <b>membership,</b> there was no official connection between Griffith's then moderate Sinn Féin and the Volunteers. The political stance of the remaining Volunteers was not always popular, and a 1,000-strong march led by Pearse through the garrison city of Limerick on Whit Sunday, 1915, was pelted with rubbish by a hostile crowd. Pearse explained the reason for the establishment of the new force when he said in May 1915: What if conscription be enforced on Ireland? What if a Unionist or a Coalition British Ministry repudiates the Home Rule Act? What if it be determined to dismember Ireland? The future is big with these and other possibilities.|$|E
2500|$|The IRA and Sinn Féin {{suffered}} from a campaign of assassination launched against their members by loyalist paramilitaries from the late 1980s. These latter attacks killed about 12 IRA and 15 Sinn Féin members between 1987 and 1994. This tactic was unusual as {{the vast majority of}} loyalist victims were Catholic civilians. In addition, loyalists killed family members of known republicans; John (or Jack) McKearney and his nephew, Kevin McKearney, and Kevin's parents-in-law, Charles and Teresa Fox (whose son, Peter, was an IRA volunteer) were all targeted by the UVF. Two of Kevin's brothers, Patrick and Sean, were PIRA volunteers killed during the Troubles. [...] According to recently released documents, British military intelligence stated in a secret 1973 draft report that within the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) it was likely there were soldiers who were also loyalist paramilitaries. Despite knowing this, the British Government stepped up the role of the UDR in [...] "maintaining order" [...] within Northern Ireland. Recently released (3 May 2006) British Government documents show that <b>overlapping</b> <b>membership</b> between British Army units like the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) and loyalist paramilitary groups was a wider problem than a [...] "few bad apples" [...] as was often claimed.|$|E

Catholics formed a core part of the New Deal Coalition, with <b>overlapping</b> <b>memberships</b> in the Church, labor unions, and big city machines, and the working class, all of which promoted liberal policy positions in domestic affairs and anti-communism during the Cold War.

50|$|The {{government}} of Japan {{does not require}} religious groups to report their membership, so {{it was difficult to}} accurately determine the number of adherents to different religious groups. The Agency for Cultural Affairs reported in 2005 that membership claims by religious groups totaled 211 million. This is out of a total population of 128 million, but does not account for <b>overlapping</b> <b>memberships</b> (some families may be registered at both a Buddhist temple and a Shinto shrine), or double membership due to change of address. This number, which is nearly twice Japan's population, reflects many citizens' affiliation with multiple religions. For example, it is very common for Japanese to practice both Buddhist and Shinto rites.|$|R
