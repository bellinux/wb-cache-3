5|$|Warner Bros. had {{initially}} planned {{to release the}} film over 4 July 2001 weekend, making for such a short production window that several proposed directors pulled themselves out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running.</b> Due to time constraints, the date was put back to 16 November 2001.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Agnew's legacy was {{perceived}} largely in negative terms. The circumstances of his fall, particularly in the light of his declared dedication to law and order, did much to engender cynicism and distrust towards politicians of every stripe. His disgrace led to a greater degree of care in the selection of potential vice presidents; had Nixon researched Agnew's background before choosing him, a national crisis might have been averted. Most <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> mates selected by the major parties after 1972 were seasoned politicians – Walter Mondale, George H. W. Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Al Gore, Dick Cheney – some of whom themselves became their party's nominee for president.|$|E
50|$|This play {{resembles a}} sweep, but before <b>the</b> <b>running</b> back crosses <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> scrimmage, {{he hands the}} ball off to a wide {{receiver}} going in the reverse (opposite) direction <b>of</b> where <b>the</b> <b>running</b> back was going. If the defense was drawn to <b>the</b> side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field <b>the</b> <b>running</b> back was going towards, the receiver can outrun the defense to <b>the</b> other side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field and make a big gain.|$|R

5|$|By {{virtue of}} this variety and his interfusion of Western, Indian folk and Carnatic elements, Ilaiyaraaja's {{compositions}} {{appeal to the}} Indian rural dweller for its rhythmic folk qualities, the Indian classical music enthusiast for the employment of Carnatic Ragas, and the urbanite for its modern, Western-music sound. Ilaiyaraaja's sense of visualization for composing music is always to match up with the storyline <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> movie and possibly by doing so, he creates the best experience for the audience to feel the emotions flavored through his musical score. He mastered this art of blending music to the narration, which very few others managed to adapt themselves over a longer time.|$|E
5|$|Crash noted how Knight Lore masking {{technique}} addressed issues of flicker and attribute clash, and Sinclair User appreciated how Sabreman disappeared from view when passing behind blocks. In criticism, reviewers considered Knight Lore sound {{to be its}} weakest component, though Your Spectrum and Clash also identified the sometimes cruel difficulty of its gameplay. Later rooms of the castle require pixel-perfect precision, compounded by the anxiety <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> timer, and the game's animations would slow down proportional {{to the degree of}} onscreen action.|$|E

He, along with George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Don Cheadle, David Pressman, and Jerry Weintraub, {{is one of the}} founders of Not On Our Watch Project, an organization that focuses global attention and resources to stop and prevent mass atrocities such as in Darfur. Damon supports the ONE Campaign, which is aimed at fighting AIDS and poverty in Third World countries. He has appeared in their print and television advertising.|$|E

5|$|In 1998, {{a working}} {{replica of the}} SSEM, now {{on display at the}} Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, was built to {{celebrate}} the 50th anniversary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> of its first program. Demonstrations of the machine in operation are held regularly at the museum. In 2008, an original panoramic photograph of the entire machine was discovered at the University of Manchester. The photograph, taken on 15 December 1948 by a research student, Alec Robinson, had been reproduced in The Illustrated London News in June 1949.|$|E
5|$|Just as in Q1, the two Mercedes cars set {{the fastest}} times in Q2 as well. Verstappen {{was unable to}} {{continue}} and therefore only four <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> cars were to be eliminated. Those were Hülkenberg, the second Toro Rosso of Sainz, Pastor Maldonado and Fernando Alonso, who said his lap was likely the best he had ever driven at the circuit.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 {{season was}} preceded by three test {{sessions}}; one at Jerez de la Frontera and two in Barcelona. These sessions gave the teams and drivers the opportunity to familiarise themselves with their cars, though the teams downplayed the accuracy of testing times as being representative <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> order for the season. At the second test in Barcelona, Lotus F1 discovered a critical fault in the build of their chassis that forced them to miss four days of running, while both HRT and Marussia were unable to complete any mileage with their 2012 cars after both the HRT F112 and Marussia MR01 failed their crash tests, though both teams were able to complete shakedowns of their cars.|$|E

5|$|The {{bank has}} gained its funding from {{different}} sources, {{and the main}} contributors have shifted over time. In the initial years, donor agencies used to provide the bulk of capital at low rates. By the mid-1990s, the bank started to get most of its funding from the central bank of Bangladesh. More recently, Grameen has started bond sales {{as a source of}} finance. The bonds are implicitly subsidised, as they are guaranteed by the Government of Bangladesh, and still they are sold above the bank rate. In 2013, Bangladesh parliament passed 'Grameen Bank Act' which replaces the Grameen Bank Ordinance, 1983, authorising the government to make rules for any aspect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> of the bank.|$|E
5|$|He {{was offered}} the job as manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973. He {{declined to be interviewed}} for the position, and instead handed the club a list of responsibilities he expected to take, which if agreed to would give him total control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> of the club. He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement that he would not be sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E
5|$|Henson {{spoke out}} strongly, and {{ultimately}} unsuccessfully, against the proposed disestablishment of the Anglican Church in Wales. In doing so he addressed many nonconformist gatherings; the historian Owen Chadwick {{suggests that this}} may have commended him to David Lloyd George, who became prime minister in 1916. A serious doctrinal row within the Church seemed to many to put Henson out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> for elevation to a bishopric. He had defended the right of clergy to express doubts about the virgin birth and bodily resurrection. He was, as most of his critics failed, or refused, to notice, doctrinally orthodox on the resurrection, and content to accept {{the tradition of the}} virgin birth, but his contention that other priests had the right to question them was intolerable to the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Church, led by Gore.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{the city was}} {{considered}} as a site for the film The Squaw Man by Jesse Lasky and Cecil B. DeMille, but was abandoned in favor of Hollywood. Several recent movies have been filmed, at least in part, in Flagstaff. A small scene in Midnight Run was filmed in Flagstaff at the train depot, the city was also referenced in the film. Several <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> scenes in Forrest Gump were filmed {{in and around the}} area, including a memorable scene where Forrest is seen jogging in downtown Flagstaff and gives inspiration to a bumper sticker designer ("Shit happens"). Parts of 2007 Academy Award winner Little Miss Sunshine were filmed at the junction of I-40 and I-17 in Flagstaff, and Terminal Velocity was partially filmed in the city.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{entered the}} game having been knocked out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> for the Atlantic Division title the {{previous}} week, but {{able to play}} spoiler for Boston College. The Eagles were playing to earn a berth to the ACC Championship Game {{for the second consecutive}} year. Additionally, competing within a closely contested ACC, Maryland could have greatly improved its standing for bowl selection with an eighth win. The Eagles were the fifth ranked team to face Maryland. The Terrapins were, to that point, 4–0 against top-25 opposition and the only team to beat four ranked opponents in 2008. Boston College was fielding second-string quarterback Dominique Davis in his first career appearance. He replaced starter Chris Crane, who had suffered a broken collarbone the previous week.|$|E
5|$|Of the 74 players {{drafted by}} the Giants in the first round, 26 played at one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> back positions. Of these, 10 were halfbacks and six were fullbacks, and the {{remaining}} 10 are credited as backs, blocking backs, or running backs. Among other frequently drafted positions, the Giants have chosen eight defensive backs, eight offensive tackles, six defensive ends, five wide receivers, four defensive tackles, and four quarterbacks. Five of the Giants' first-round picks attended the University of Notre Dame, {{more than any other}} college. Four picks came from Miami, while seven universities have had three players selected. The Giants have held the first overall pick twice, in 1951 and 1965, selecting Kyle Rote and Tucker Frederickson. Three of the team's first-round picks—George Connor, Frank Gifford, and Lawrence Taylor—have been elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Kimi Räikkönen was able to compete, after the Ferrari crew was able to change his gearbox in time for the session. Not running was Jenson Button, after his team decided not to go out, since a 55-place grid penalty would have placed him {{at the back of the}} grid at any case. Marcus Ericsson was more than half a second quicker than teammate Felipe Nasr, who failed to proceed into Q2, as did both Manor Marussia drivers. With Button out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running,</b> just one more driver was eliminated, and that proved to be his McLaren teammate Alonso, who barely missed out on making the cut. At the front, Rosberg set the fastest time ahead of Vettel, while Hamilton was the only driver not to use the soft compound tyre.|$|E
5|$|The 1950s saw {{the rise}} of yet more dynasties and power programs. Oklahoma, under coach Bud Wilkinson, won three {{national}} titles (1950, 1955, 1956) and all ten Big Eight Conference championships in the decade while building a record 47-game winning streak. Woody Hayes led Ohio State to two national titles, in 1954 and 1957, and dominated the Big Ten conference, winning three Big Ten titles—more than any other school. Wilkinson and Hayes, along with Robert Neyland of Tennessee, oversaw a revival <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> game in the 1950s. Passing numbers dropped {{from an average of}} 18.9 attempts in 1951 to 13.6 attempts in 1955, while teams averaged just shy of 50 running plays per game. Nine out of ten Heisman trophy winners in the 1950s were runners. Notre Dame, one of the biggest passing teams of the decade, saw a substantial decline in success; the 1950s were the only decade between 1920 and 1990 when the team did not win at least a share of the national title. Paul Hornung, Notre Dame quarterback, did, however, win the Heisman in 1956, becoming the only player from a losing team ever to do so.|$|E
5|$|The group quickly {{separated}} {{on the run}} leg and {{the lead}} group was down to eight athletes after one lap <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>running</b> course. They were Spirig, Nordén, Densham, Jenkins, Groff and Hewitt, Ainhoa Murúa (Spain) and Emma Jackson (Australia). Jackson {{was the first to}} get dropped and was followed by Groff and Murúa. The five remaining athletes finished the second run lap together. The group was then reduced to four when Hewitt was dropped. The American Groff then rejoined the group at the very start of the final run lap after been dropped earlier on in the race. With 500 metres in the final lap to race Jenkins was dropped by the other four athletes. In the ensuing sprint finish between Spirig, Nordén, Densham and Groff, Spirig pushed the pace and held off a fast-finishing Nordén to win by an estimated margin of 15 centimetres. Both athletes recorded a time one hour, 59 minutes and 48 seconds, and were separated by a photo finish. Densham finished two seconds behind Spirig to win bronze. Groff finished fourth with Jenkins fifth, Hewitt sixth, Murúa seventh and Jackson eighth.|$|E
