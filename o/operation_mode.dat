2500|$|The ATC {{system is}} derived from Deutsche Bahn's Linienzugbeeinflussung (LZB), with {{additional}} parts added for door control and other safety systems. It works by transmitting data from the train to the interlocking station through two cables installed in the track between the rails. About {{one year after the}} U3 line has entered service, it is intended to convert U2 line to full ATC operations; however, during the first year there will be mixed traffic of ATC-run driverless DT3 units on U3 courses and conventionally run DT1 and DT2 units on U2 and U21 courses between Rathenauplatz and Rothenburger Straße. This has not been done anywhere before and therefore the ATC system had to be specifically designed and developed to allow for this mixed <b>operation</b> <b>mode.</b> [...] All train operations will be automated, including normal operation, coupling and uncoupling of two DT3 units in storage tracks as well as at platforms, moving trains from and to storage tracks as well as reversing trains at platforms and in storage tracks.|$|E

40|$|With the {{development}} of space electronic technology, the space payload <b>operation</b> <b>modes</b> {{are more and more}} complex, and manual interpretation is prone to errors for much workload. Generally the space payload’s <b>operation</b> <b>modes</b> are reflected by its telemetry data. By analysing the characteristics of the payload telemetry data, it is proposed an automatic analysis method of payload <b>operation</b> <b>modes</b> based on divide–and–conquer clustering. The clustering method combines division and incremental clustering. The principle of the method is introduced and the method is validated using the actual payload telemetry data. Furthermore the improved method is proposed to the problems encountered. Experimental results show that divide–and–conquer clustering method has the feature of calculation simple and classification accurate, when applied to the classification of payload <b>operation</b> <b>modes.</b> Furthermore this method {{can be applied to the}} other areas of payload data processing by extending the method...|$|R
2500|$|Under [...] "normal", {{progressive}} and linear acceleration and deceleration, the DSG shifts in a sequential manner; i.e., under acceleration: 1st → 2nd → 3rd → 4th → 5th → 6th, {{and the same}} sequence reversed for deceleration. However, the DSG can also skip the normal sequential method, by missing gears, and shift two or more gears. This is most apparent if the car is being driven at sedate speeds {{in one of the}} higher gears with a light throttle opening, and the accelerator pedal is then pressed down, engaging the kick-down function. During kick-down, the DSG will skip gears, shifting directly to the most appropriate gear depending on speed and throttle opening. This kick-down may be engaged by any increased accelerator pedal opening, and is completely independent of the additional resistance to be found when the pedal is pressed fully to the floor, which will activate a similar kick-down function when in Manual <b>operation</b> <b>mode.</b> The seven-speed unit in the 2007 Audi variants will not automatically shift to 6th gear; rather, it stays at 5th to keep power available at a high RPM while cruising.|$|E

Uneven liquid distribution {{and the formation}} of hot spots are the most serious problems experienced during trickle flow operation. In this paper, we advocate the use of non-steady state operation of trickle-bed reactors. Based on a square-wave cycled liquid feed, several <b>operation</b> <b>modes</b> are developed that involve the artificial induction of natural pulses and control of the catalyst wetting efficiency over longer times. The <b>operation</b> <b>modes</b> aim at increasing the mass transfer rate of the limiting reactant and simultaneous prevention of flow maldistribution and hot spot formation. The <b>operation</b> <b>modes</b> are distinguished by a relatively fast and slow cycling of the liquid feed. The potential advantages of the developed feed strategies on reactor performance are evaluated...|$|R
