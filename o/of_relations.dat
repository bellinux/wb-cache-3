5|$|According to Karl Potter {{and other}} scholars, Hinduism {{developed}} various theory <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> such as satkaryavada, asatkaryavada, avirodhavada and others. The anekantavada overlaps with two major theories found in Hindu and Buddhist thought, according to James Lochtefeld. The Anekantavada doctrine is satkaryavada in explaining causes, and the asatkaryavada in explaining qualities or attributes in the effects. The different schools of Hindu philosophy further elaborated and refined {{the theory of}} pramanas and the theory <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> to establish correct means to structure propositions in their view.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1969, Chinese forces {{started the}} Sino–Soviet border conflict. The Sino–Soviet split had chagrined Premier Alexei Kosygin a great deal, {{and for a}} while he refused to accept its irrevocability; he briefly visited Beijing in 1969 due to the {{increase}} of tension between the USSR and China. By the early 1980s, both the Chinese and the Soviets were issuing statements calling for a normalisation <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> between the two states. The conditions given to the Soviets by the Chinese were the reduction of Soviet military presence in the Sino–Soviet border and the withdrawal of Soviets troops in Afghanistan and the Mongolian People's Republic and to end their support for the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. Brezhnev responded in his March 1982 speech in Tashkent where he called for the normalisation <b>of</b> <b>relations.</b> Full Sino–Soviet normalisations <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> would prove to take years, until the last Soviet ruler, Mikhail Gorbachev came to power.|$|E

5|$|American {{public opinion}} blamed the {{violence}} on British interference in American affairs through financial and munitions {{support for the}} Indians. This led to a further deterioration <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> with Britain and was a catalyst of the War of 1812, which began six months later. By the time the US declared war on the United Kingdom in June 1812, Tecumseh's confederacy was ready to launch its war against the United States in alliance with the British. In preparation, the Natives soon rebuilt Prophetstown. Frontier violence in the region would continue until well after the War of 1812, although Tecumseh was killed in 1813 during the Battle of the Thames.|$|E

5|$|Graphs and {{directed}} graphs {{can be viewed}} as a special case of the far more general notion called relational structures (defined as a set with a tuple <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> on it). Directed graphs are structures with a single binary relation (adjacency) on the domain (the vertex set). Under this view, homomorphisms of such structures are exactly graph homomorphisms.|$|E

Hetman Stanisław Żółkiewski defeated the Cossack units in 1596 and Severyn Nalyvaiko was executed. A temporary pacification <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> followed in the early 17th century, when the many wars fought by the Commonwealth necessitated greater involvement by registered Cossacks. But the Union of Brest resulted in new tensions, as the Cossacks had become dedicated adherents and defenders of the Eastern Orthodoxy.|$|E

40|$|Presently {{we often}} think that various {{problems}} in educational environment, such as bullying and truancy, {{result from the}} dilution <b>of</b> human <b>relations</b> in our daily lives. In such contexts, {{we tend to think}} that the concept <b>of</b> <b>relation</b> is something substantialsomething we can actively and manipulatively deal with. However, in order to grasp the invisible aspect <b>of</b> the <b>relation,</b> we should take a different approach. This article casts new light on the concept <b>of</b> <b>relation</b> by reexamining Weil's idea about μεταξν. By using the Greek preposition μεταξν as a noun, she shows us the importance of "medium" or "mediation" in our encounters with the other whom we may not recognize easily. Such encounters put us into the state of confusion and conflict. It is the function of μεταξν that gives us energy to tolerate it. In the following, first, our daily lives will be discussed as the state <b>of</b> oblivion <b>of</b> <b>relation.</b> Next, examining her usage of μεταξν, another possibility entailed by the concept <b>of</b> <b>relation</b> will be revealed...|$|R

5|$|Palmer {{begins by}} {{defending}} {{the claim that}} animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; utilitarian approaches, animal rights approaches, and capabilities approaches. All are lacking, she argues, as they are fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds <b>of</b> <b>relations</b> humans may have with animals: affective, contractual and, most significantly, causal.|$|E
