5|$|At this point, NY75 turns northeastward, <b>overlapping</b> <b>with</b> US62 {{into the}} nearby town of Hamburg along Gowanda State Road. Development along the highway quickly rises in density from a large farm and a pocket of homes {{at the start of the}} {{concurrency}} to a series of residential streets across the town line that make up the hamlet of Water Valley. The influx of homes brings US62 and NY75 across the main channel of Eighteenmile Creek and into the village of Hamburg, where the highway changes names to Pierce Avenue. The two routes remain concurrent for three blocks to an intersection with Lake Avenue, where Pierce Avenue becomes Main Street. While US62 continues east into Hamburg's central business district on Main Street, NY75 follows Lake Street northward along the mostly residential western edge of the village.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, NY8 {{was assigned to}} most of its current alignment from Deposit to Hague. The route also extended eastward to Wright (southeast of Ticonderoga) on modern NY9N, NY22, and County Route2 (CR2), where it connected to VTF-10 {{by way of a}} ferry across Lake Champlain. From Clayville to Utica, NY8 was originally routed along Oneida Street before <b>overlapping</b> <b>with</b> NY5 and NY12 along Genesee Street in downtown Utica. After crossing the Mohawk River and the Erie Canal, the three routes separated at the intersection of Herkimer Road, Trenton Road, and Coventry Avenue northeast of downtown. NY8 then followed Coventry Avenue and Walker Road northeast to Deerfield, where NY8 joined its modern alignment.|$|E
5|$|In {{the center}} of the hamlet, US9 and NY23 {{encounter}} a complex intersection that features a total of four routes. At the junction, US9 continues to the southwest while NY82 continues southeast along NY23's course. NY23, meanwhile, picks up US9's routing, <b>overlapping</b> <b>with</b> NY9H in a northerly direction that takes both highways across Taghkanic Creek and into the equally rural town of Claverack. The routes remain overlapped into the hamlet of Claverack, where NY23B comes in from the west and finishes its alternate loop of NY23. At the same junction, NY23 leaves the north–south NY9H to resume an eastwest alignment toward the Massachusetts state line.|$|E
5|$|In {{the knot}} of {{highways}} that is the Genesee County seat, NY33 crosses and briefly overlaps with not only NY5, the other east–west route in town, but both north–south routes, NY63 and NY98. While concurrent with NY98 on Oak Street Extension, NY33 passes over Tonawanda Creek, which travels through Batavia on a roughly northwest–southeast alignment. The brief overlap with NY98 ends at Main Street, which carries NY5 and NY63 through the western portion of the city. NY33 turns east here, <b>overlapping</b> <b>with</b> NY5 and NY63 for five blocks along the four-lane, mostly commercial Main Street.

5|$|NY191 {{began at}} an {{intersection}} with NY22 and Miner Farm Road (CR23) in the Clinton County hamlet of Sciota, {{located within the}} town of Chazy. The route headed to the northeast as a two-lane county-maintained, state-numbered highway, <b>overlapping</b> <b>with</b> CR23 and taking on the Miner Farm Road name. East of Sciota, the highway traversed lightly developed areas, serving several residences separated by patches of woodlands. The route eventually began {{to turn to the}} southeast, connecting with Angelville Road (unsigned CR20) in the process. A long stretch of dense forests followed the turn, with little to no development along the highway.|$|E
5|$|NY31E {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY31 {{in the village}} of Middleport in eastern Niagara County. The route heads north as Main Street, <b>overlapping</b> <b>with</b> NY271 (which also begins at NY31) through the mostly residential village. Just south of the Erie Canal, NY31E and NY271 enter Middleport's small business district, centered on the junction of Main and State Streets. Here, NY31E and NY271 split, with NY31E following State Street eastward through the eastern portion of the community. Along this stretch, the route serves Royalton–Hartland High School and Royalton-Hartland Middle School before exiting Middleport and entering a slightly more open area of the town of Royalton. NY31E runs past undeveloped land to the north and a smattering of homes to the south on its way into the Orleans County town of Shelby New York|Ridgeway]].|$|E
5|$|NY365 is {{the only}} post-1930 state route that once entered Hamilton County, but no longer does. When it was {{assigned}} , the route entered Hamilton County from Herkimer County, <b>overlapping</b> <b>with</b> NY28 until Blue Mountain Lake. Here, it turned off NY28 and onto NY10 (later NY30) and NY28N. The three routes overlapped to Long Lake, where NY28N split off from both NY10 and NY365. The two highways continued northward, leaving Hamilton County and passing into Franklin County north of Long Lake. NY365 was truncated in the late 1950s to end near the Oneida County village of Holland Patent, eliminating a series of overlaps between NY365 and other state routes that collectively extended from Holland Patent to Plattsburgh, Clinton County.|$|E

NY474 heads east through rural southwest Chautauqua County, briefly paralleling French Creek to the hamlet of Marvin before intersecting and briefly <b>overlapping</b> <b>with</b> NY426 through the small hamlet of Cutting. NY474 exits Cutting and continues on an easterly track into the town of Clymer and the hamlet of the same name, where it meets County Route15 (CR15), a local road leading from the Pennsylvania state line (where the road continues south to Corry) north to Sherman {{in the center of the}} community.|$|E
5|$|The {{scattered}} disc is a {{sparsely populated}} region, <b>overlapping</b> <b>with</b> the Kuiper belt but extending to beyond 100 AU. Scattered disc objects (SDOs) have very elliptical orbits, often also very inclined to the ecliptic. Most models of Solar System formation show both KBOs and SDOs first forming in a primordial belt, with later gravitational interactions, particularly with Neptune, sending the objects outward, some into stable orbits (the KBOs) and some into unstable orbits, the scattered disc. Due to its unstable nature, the scattered disc is suspected {{to be the}} point of origin {{of many of the}} Solar System's short-period comets. Their dynamic orbits occasionally force them into the inner Solar System, first becoming centaurs, and then short-period comets.|$|E
5|$|Joel is {{voiced by}} veteran voice actor Troy Baker, while Ellie is voiced by actress Ashley Johnson. Their {{performances}} were mostly recorded using motion capture technology; approximately 85% of the game's animations were recorded using motion capture, with remaining audio elements recorded {{later in a}} studio. Though the team quickly felt that Johnson fit the role of Ellie, they spent more time selecting the actor of Joel, as the chemistry between the two characters was imperative to the game. After Baker and Johnson played alongside each other, the team realised that the former perfectly fit the role of Joel, despite the actor's young age. Druckmann attributed Baker's voice and movement to the team's choice of casting him. Baker and Johnson contributed greatly {{to the development of}} the characters. For example, Baker convinced Druckmann that Joel would care for Tess due to his loneliness, and Johnson convinced Druckmann to re-write the character of Ellie in a stronger and more defensive manner. Some of the dialogue between the duo was improvised by the actors; Druckmann attributed this to the fact that the script included an unnecessary number of lines during gameplay sections, and he allowed the actors to choose what they felt was necessary. The characters of Joel and Ellie were the basis of the game; the development between the characters was established first, and the game's other concepts followed. From the beginning of development, the team intended for The Last of Us to feature dual protagonists with strong individual story arcs. During the Winter segment of the game, players assume control of Ellie. The developers ensured that this change was kept secretive prior to the game's release, to surprise players; they did the same with Ellie's immunity, as well as with the game's prologue, where players assume control of Joel's daughter Sarah. The change of control from Joel to Ellie signifies a change in the role of the protector, echoing Druckmann's previous ideas as a student. The character interactions were inspired by the relationship between Nathan Drake and Tenzin in Uncharted 2: Among Thieves, in turn inspired by the video game Ico. The game's protagonists represent the two eras that are shown in the game; Joel represents the world before the outbreak, having spent most of his life during this period, while Ellie represents the world after the outbreak, as she was born in the post-apocalyptic world. While the former is emotionally damaged due to the loss that he has experienced, the latter maintains an optimistic view of life, having become familiar to the damaged world; spending time with each other saw these qualities <b>overlapping,</b> <b>with</b> Joel become more lively, and Ellie learning more survival skills.|$|E
