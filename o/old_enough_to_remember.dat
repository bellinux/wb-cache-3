5|$|Empire of the Sun {{was filmed}} at Elstree Studios in the United Kingdom, and on {{location}} in Shanghai and Spain. The filmmakers searched across Asia {{in an attempt to}} find locations that resembled 1941 Shanghai. They entered negotiations with Shanghai Film Studios and China Film Co-Production Corporation in 1985. After a year of negotiations, permission was granted for a three-week shoot in early March 1987. It was the first American film shot in Shanghai since the 1940s. The Chinese authorities allowed the crew to alter signs to traditional Chinese characters, as well as closing down city blocks for filming. Over 5,000 local extras were used, some <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the Japanese occupation of Shanghai 40 years earlier. Members of the People's Liberation Army played Japanese soldiers. Other locations included Trebujena in Andalusia, Knutsford in Cheshire and Sunningdale in Berkshire. Lean often visited the set during the England shoot.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued that the key drivers for Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania are that Kenya wishes to export surplus capital, Uganda seeks an outlet for its surplus labour, and Tanzania wants to realise a Pan-African vision. It has also been argued, however, that the commonalities go far deeper. Many of the {{national}} elites <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the former EAC often share memories and a sharp sense of loss at its eventual dissolution. More cynically, others have argued that this historical ambition provides politicians with the ability to present themselves as statesmen and representatives of a greater regional interest. Furthermore, EAC institutions bring significant new powers to dispose and depose to those who serve in them.|$|E

Michael Jordan didn't have as many championships as Bill Russell and didn't score as many points as Wilt Chamberlain, and really didn't do anything to advance his sport, so maybe in retrospect I upgraded him {{a bit too much}} because the way he performed was so spectacular, and because of television I got to see highlights.

6000|$|Our last {{authentic}} {{glimpse of}} Diderot {{is from the}} pen of a humane and enlightened Englishman, whose memory must be held in perpetual honour among us. Samuel Romilly, then a young man of four-and-twenty, visited Paris in 1781. He made the acquaintance of the namesake who had written the articles on watch-making in the Encyclopædia, and whose son had written the more famous articles on Toleration and Virtue. By this honest man Romilly was introduced to D'Alembert and Diderot. The former was in weak health and said very little. Diderot, on the contrary, was all warmth and eagerness, and talked to his visitor with as little reserve {{as if he had}} been long and intimately acquainted with him. He spoke on politics, religion, and philosophy. He praised the English for having led the way to sound philosophy, but the adventurous genius of the French, he said, had pushed them on before their guides. [...] "You others," [...] he continued, [...] "mix up theology with your philosophy; that is to spoil everything, it is to mix up lies with truth; il faut sabrer la théologie--we must put theology to the sword." [...] He was ostentatious, Romilly says, of a total disbelief in the existence of a God. He quoted Plato, [...] "the author of all the good theology that ever existed in the world, as saying that there is a vast curtain drawn over the heavens, and that men must content themselves with what passes beneath that curtain, without ever attempting to raise it; and in order to complete my conversion from my unhappy errors, he read me all through a little work of his own"--of which we shall presently speak. On politics he talked very eagerly, [...] "and inveighed with great warmth against the tyranny of the French government. He told me that he had long meditated a work upon the death of Charles the First; that he had studied the trial of that prince; and that his intention was to have tried him over again, and to have sent him to the scaffold if he had found him guilty, but that he had at last relinquished the design. In England he would have executed it, but he had not the courage to do so in France. D'Alembert, as I have observed was more cautious; he contented himself with observing what an effect philosophy had in his own time produced on the minds of the people. The birth of the Dauphin (known afterwards as Lewis XVII., the unhappy prisoner of the Temple) afforded him an example. He was <b>old</b> <b>enough,</b> he said, <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> when such an event had made the whole nation drunk with joy (1729), but now they regarded with great indifference the birth of another master."[191] ...|$|R

It took nine takes for Allen to pronounce Bart's catchphrase [...] "¡Ay, caramba!" [...] correctly, {{to the point where the}} staff began to get slightly frustrated with him. There was a discussion amongst the writing team of whether the episode should end with a joke or have a [...] "sweet" [...] ending.

500|$|According to the BBC, while {{divisions}} and resentment exist between Greek and Turkish Cypriots in the UK, particularly amongst those <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> atrocities committed in Cyprus, [...] "if {{differences of opinion}} exist, both sides have learnt to live together regardless". Community relations are generally good, with Turkish Cypriot community centres welcoming Greek Cypriots and vice versa. In oral history interviews conducted by academic Nergis Canefe in the late 1990s, Turkish Cypriots in London tended to define themselves as Anglo-Cypriot, particularly if they {{were born in the}} UK. Canefe notes that her interviewees were proud to be Cypriot, but also of being British and not Turkish. They had Turkish friends, but also close Greek and Greek Cypriot friends. The neighbourhoods they inhabited tended to be ethnically mixed, and often shared with Greeks and Greek Cypriots.|$|E
500|$|The 20th {{anniversary of}} [...] "We Are the World" [...] was celebrated in 2005. Radio {{stations}} around the world paid homage to USA for Africa's creation by simultaneously broadcasting the charity song. In addition to the simulcast, the milestone was marked by {{the release of a}} two-disc DVD called We Are the World: The Story Behind the Song. Ken Kragen asserted that the reason behind the simulcast and DVD release was not for USA for Africa to praise themselves for doing a good job, but to [...] "use it to do some more good [...] That's all we care about accomplishing." [...] Harry Belafonte also commented on the 20thanniversary of the song. The entertainer acknowledged that [...] "We Are the World" [...] had [...] "stood the test of time"; anyone <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> it can still at least hum along.|$|E

So I {{questioned}} myself: “What does a black man have to do before he’s given the respect as a man?” So when I was 18 years old, when I was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> fight and die for my country, <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> drink, <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> vote, I said I was <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be called a man.

2500|$|If Eilmer {{had seen}} Halley's comet seventy-six years earlier in 989, {{he could have}} been born about 984, making him about five or six years old when he first saw the comet, <b>old</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> it.
