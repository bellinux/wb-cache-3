40|$|The American Journal of Economics and Sociology, January 1989. Refereed Journal ArticleThe general {{stereotype}} of modern Third World military regimes {{is that of}} ultra-conservativism combined with military force to dismantle organizations of popular expression. These organizations through their rent-seeking activities are assumed to have reduced <b>overall</b> rates of <b>economic</b> growth. Em· pirically, the paper does find some support for this line of argument. However, It is apparent that the traditional stereotypes are inappropriate. The two regime types differ largely in terms of contrasting styles of <b>economic</b> <b>management.</b> Military regimes create an environment where military expenditures {{tend to have a}} positive <b>overall</b> impact on <b>economic</b> growth. Civilian regimes having less control over rent seeking groups {{do not appear to be}} able to combine rent seeking activities and military expenditures in a manner conducive to <b>overall</b> <b>economic</b> growth...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} recent and ongoing {{changes in the}} {{practice}} of medicine from a business standpoint as well as in <b>overall</b> practice <b>management.</b> <b>Economic</b> and lifestyle desires have pushed many physicians to a decision point of whether or not to join a large multispecialty group or to sell their practice and become an employee of a hospital system. There are advantages and disadvantages to both options; however, deciding on the most appropriate path for each individual can be a daunting task. At our recent breakfast session at the vascular annual meeting in Chicago, Illinois, in June 2011, we brought to light these topics to try and help enlighten physicians on which option may be right for them. There is no single answer/option that will fit every practice, but discussion for various practice management designs are outlined and critiqued. This article cannot fully discuss each view in the allotted space, but it is designed to encourage thought and discussion among the vascular surgical community as a whole...|$|R

The analysis of the available data of tourist arrivals and number of tourist overnight stays in observed countries of the Western Balkans (Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro) led us to conduct research {{in order to determine}} tourism contribution to the <b>overall</b> <b>economic</b> growth. Based on the modified methodology used by Brida et al.

The level of tourism contribution to the <b>overall</b> <b>economic</b> growth varies and it is primarily related to diversity and quality of supply (the highest contribution is recorded in Montenegro, while lowest contribution is observed in Macedonia) ...|$|R

40|$|State Governments {{have always}} {{played a role}} in <b>economic</b> {{development}} <b>management,</b> but their entry into direct export promotion is fairly recent. Although state governments have increased their involvement in this area, little is known concerning the outcome of such efforts. This study reports and analyzes the findings of a survey of Oklahoma firms that have received state based export assistance. Traditionally, international <b>economic</b> <b>management</b> has been the province of the federal government. A series of political and economic circumstances, how-ever, has prompted state and local governments to become increasingly involved in international <b>economic</b> policy <b>management.</b> This development is of interest from a variety of perspectives. At the macro-level, a substantial literature emphasizes the growing impor-tance of new, international actors. This literature asserts that economic interde-pendence increases the level of international activity undertaken by previously domestic governmental structures. This in tum renders analysis and manage-ment of foreign policy by central bureaucracies more problematic (Manning 1977; Keohane and Nye 1989, Ch. 2; Czempicll 989). At the micro-level, the efforts of states to direct their economic develop-ment programs overseas have become well financed and are central to their <b>overall</b> <b>economic</b> vitality. The purpose here is to explore the pattern of interac-tion between Oklahoma's export promotion agency and the private sector firms it was created to assist. First, we examine the processes which have encouraged state-level export promotion efforts. Next, we discuss the existing research on state export promotion. We then present the results of our own survey research and discuss the implications of our findings for the state of Oklahoma and fo...|$|R

Along this study, the intermediary role of organizational commitment is considered. At first, the available surveys and articles on the effective <b>economic</b> <b>management</b> were classified, and then the key components including organizational innovation, self- reliance and spiritualization were extracted. Then it was arranged {{in the form of}} a questionnaire by the experts. Afterwards, the questionnaires were distributed among 110 managers and employees at various agencies at Fars Agriculture Organization. After revising some of statements, and deleting those statements which had little operative and narrative load factor, the mentioned questionnaire got validated and was applied. Then 72 managers and employees of Fars Province Agriculture Organization were selected for statistical considerations. The effective <b>economic</b> <b>management</b> questionnaire, organizational commitment questionnaire by Allen and Meyer (1991), and organizational-citizenship behavior questionnaire (Organ, 1998) were distributed among them. The theories were studied by using LISREL software and through analyzing the path.
