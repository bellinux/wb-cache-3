25|$|In 1980 Brian De Palma, who {{directed}} Carrie, wanted Liv Ullmann {{to play the}} role of Kate Miller in the erotic crime thriller Dressed to Kill and offered it to her, but she declined because of the violence. The role subsequently went to Angie Dickinson. In 1982 Ingmar Bergman wanted Ullmann to play the main character Emelie Ekdahl in his last feature film, Fanny and Alexander and wrote the role with this in mind. But Ullmann felt the role was too sad and declined. Liv Ullmann later stated in interviews that turning it down was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> she really regrets.|$|E

25|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> {{that both}} the Greco-Roman and the vernacular Irish sources agree on about the druids is that they played an {{important}} part in pagan Celtic society. In his description, Julius Caesar claimed that they were one of the two most important social groups in the region (alongside the equites, or nobles) and were responsible for organizing worship and sacrifices, divination, and judicial procedure in Gaulish, British and Irish society. He also claimed that they were exempt from military service and from the payment of taxes, and had the power to excommunicate people from religious festivals, making them social outcasts. Two other classical writers, Diodorus Siculus and Strabo, also wrote about the role of druids in Gallic society, claiming that the druids were held in such respect that if they intervened between two armies they could stop the battle.|$|E
25|$|Once La Rue {{was engaged}} with the Grande chapelle, he made two trips to Spain. On the second trip, in 1506, he was shipwrecked in the English Channel, and spent three {{months at the}} court of Henry VII of England. After two more years in Spain, {{in the service of}} Juana of Castile – Joanna the Mad – he {{returned}} to the Netherlands in 1508, probably because Juana had been forced out of power (her husband, Philip, had died of typhus in 1506). Juana was inconsolable, unable to leave the corpse of her dead husband, and had become quite insane; why La Rue stayed as long as he did is not known, but it is not impossible that his dark, intensely expressive music was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> that brought her solace. In addition, he was treated well. Juana promoted him to premier chapelain, the head of the chapel, and paid him twice what the other singers received; paying the singers was apparently the one of the only practical administrative matters she was able to do during the period of her madness.|$|E
500|$|The name [...] "Robinsons" [...] {{has also}} been {{used to refer to}} those Jews who hid out in the ruins of the Warsaw Ghetto in the {{aftermath}} of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. Uri Orlev's (Jerzy Orlowski) children's book The Island on Bird Street (1981), adapted into a 1997 film, tells the story of an 11-year-old boy who hides out in the ruins of the ghetto. Orlev also draws analogies with Robinson Crusoe in this work; in fact one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> Alex, the story's protagonist, possesses is a copy of Defoe's novel.|$|E

500|$|During the two Zaca expeditions Beebe was {{accompanied}} by his longtime assistant John Tee-Van as well as Jocelyn Crane, a young carcinologist who had first worked for Beebe at Nonsuch Island in 1932, and who would subsequently be among Beebe's most cherished associates {{for the rest of}} his life. Like Hollister before her, Crane would eventually become Beebe's lover during the long expeditions that Beebe made without Elswyth's companionship. During this time Beebe was also forming a close friendship with Winnie-the-Pooh's creator A. A. Milne, who wrote of Half Mile Down [...] "I don't know which I envy you most: all those moral and physical qualities which you have and I lack, or all that wonder of a new world. [...] One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> in the world of which I am really proud is that I know Will Beebe." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{principal}} room is {{the large}} Marble Hall (1) at {{the centre of the}} south front; this hall {{is the beginning of a}} grand procession of rooms, and corresponds to the former Great Parlour or Saloon (9) on the north front. The Marble Hall is flanked by the former Little Parlour (11, now the Tapestry Room) and the Great Staircase (2), while the Saloon is flanked by two withdrawing rooms (8, 10). The bedrooms are arranged in individual suites on both floors of the two wings (3, etc.) that flank the state centre of the house. The main staircase, set to one side of the Marble Hall, is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> at Belton which is asymmetrically placed. It has a robust plaster-work ceiling incorporating the Brownlow crest by the London plasterer Edward Goudge, [...] "now looked on as ye best master in England in his profession," [...] William Winde reported in 1690.|$|E
500|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> {{retained}} {{from earlier}} ships was {{the position of}} the tripod foremast with its spotting top behind the forward funnel to allow the vertical leg to be used to support the boat-handling derrick. This all but guaranteed that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable at times, but the Board of Admiralty insisted on it for all the ships of the 1909–1910 Programme. David K. Brown, naval architect and historian, commented on the whole fiasco: [...] "It is amazing that it took so long to attain a satisfactory arrangement, which was caused by the Director of Naval Ordnance (DNO)'s insistence on sighting hoods in the roofs of turrets and Jellicoe's obsession with boat-handling arrangements. These unsatisfactory layouts reduced firepower, prejudiced torpedo protection and probably added to cost. As DNO and then as Controller, Jellicoe must accept much of the blame for the unsatisfactory layout of the earlier ships." ...|$|E

500|$|John Jude Palencar {{illustrated}} the English cover featuring the golden dragon Glaedr. The {{content of the}} cover was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> initially confirmed by Paolini before he wrote the book. He had originally planned for it to feature a green dragon, but later indicated that this was affected by {{the expansion of the}} series to a four-book cycle. Paolini liked the cover because it reflects that Brisingr is the longest and [...] "most intense entry in the series so far." [...] The Japanese translation of Brisingr was so large that the publisher split it into two volumes. Since the Japanese did not want the same cover on two volumes, they commissioned Palencar to paint one of the Lethrblaka for the second volume. The Lethrblaka are the Ra'zac's steeds and parents. Paolini made drawings based on the book for the deluxe edition of Brisingr, including one with Eragon's arm and hand holding the sword he receives in the book. The sword, named Brisingr, has flames around its blade.|$|E
2500|$|Tiurin, {{the foreman}} of gang 104, is strict but kind, and the squad's fondness of Tiurin becomes more evident {{as the book}} progresses. Though a [...] "morose" [...] man, Tiurin is liked because he understands the prisoners, he talks to them, and he helps them. Shukhov {{is one of the}} hardest workers in the squad and is {{generally}} well-respected. Rations are meagre at the camp, but they are one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> that Shukhov lives for. He conserves the food that he receives and is always watchful for any item that he can hide and trade for food at a later date.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after taking}} over, United laid off all but nine of WMUR's {{employees}} and reduced local programming to its two daily newscasts. For the next 22 years, United ran channel 9 {{on a shoestring}} budget, devoting most of its efforts to managing Manchester's cable franchise. [...] It paid almost {{no attention to the}} station even as equipment broke down. [...] The studio's upkeep also suffered; the floor was so slanted that cameras rolled on their own. [...] WMUR continued to broadcast in black-and-white up until 1973, long after the Boston stations all upgraded to color capability. [...] Two <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> the station had going for it during this time were The Uncle Gus Show, hosted by Gus Bernier for more than 20 years, and an increasingly active news department led by Tom Bonnar and Fred Kocher.|$|E
5000|$|Spain is {{a poem by}} W. H. Auden written {{after his}} visit to the Spanish Civil War. [...] Spain was {{described}} by George Orwell as [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> decent <b>things</b> that have been written about the Spanish war". It was written and published in 1937. Auden donated all the profits from <b>the</b> sale <b>of</b> Spain to <b>the</b> Spanish Medical Aid Committee.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{appendix}} to his thesis, Mahood {{argues that}} the unexpectedly small magnitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> results in his experiments are a confirmation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cancellation predicted by Whealton; the results are instead due to higher-order mass transients which are not exactly cancelled. Mahood would later describe this argument as [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> very <b>few</b> <b>things</b> Ive {{done in my life}} that I actually regret".|$|R

2500|$|The St. Louis Browns {{acquired}} Peitz in {{the fall}} of 1892, and he made his Major League Baseball debut in the final game of the season in October 1892. [...] He played three full seasons for the Browns from 1893 to 1895. [...] While catching for the Browns, Peitz teamed up with left-handed pitcher Ted Breitenstein, and the pair became known as the [...] "Pretzel Battery." [...] Peitz and Breitenstein were both sons of German immigrants and St. Louis natives. [...] In the [...] "Cardinals Encyclopedia", authors Mike Eisenbath and Stan Musial wrote that The [...] "Pretzel Battery" [...] was [...] "one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> exciting about St. Louis's National League team those first few seasons." [...] The nickname reportedly developed when the pair were drinking beer and eating pretzels after a game, when a fan noticed them and yelled, [...] "Look, it's the 'pretzel battery'." ...|$|E
2500|$|One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> that {{is known}} of Fuzûlî's life during this time is how he arrived at his pen name. In the {{introduction}} to his collected Persian poems, he says: [...] "In the early days when I {{was just beginning to}} write poetry, every few days I would set my heart on a particular pen name and then after a time change it for another because someone showed up who shared the same name". Eventually, he decided upon the Arabic word fuzûlî—which literally means [...] "impertinent, improper, unnecessary"—because he [...] "knew that this title would not be acceptable to anyone else". Despite the name's pejorative meaning, however, it contains a double meaning—what is called tevriyye (توريه) in Ottoman Divan poetry—as Fuzûlî himself explains: [...] "I was possessed of all the arts and sciences and found a pen name that also implies this sense since in the dictionary fuzûl (ﻓﻀﻮل) is given as a plural of fazl (ﻓﻀﻞ; 'learning') and has the same rhythm as ‘ulûm (ﻋﻠﻮم; 'sciences') and fünûn (ﻓﻨﻮن; 'arts')".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, Mack gave a {{minority}} {{stake in the}} team to his three sons, Roy, Earle, and Connie, Jr. [...] Although Roy and Earle had never gotten along with Connie, Jr., who was more than 20 years younger than them, Connie, Sr. intended to have {{all three of them}} inherit the team after his death or retirement. [...] This strategy backfired when Roy and Earle refused to consider Connie, Jr.'s demands to end the team's bargain-basement way of doing business. [...] One <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> on which they agreed was {{that it was time for}} their father to step down. [...] Connie, Jr. was only able to force through other minor improvements to the team and the rapidly crumbling Shibe Park through an alliance with the Shibe heirs. [...] When it became apparent that his older brothers weren't willing to go further, Connie, Jr. and the Shibes decided to sell the team. [...] However, Roy and Earle countered by buying out their younger brother, persuading their father to support them. [...] In order to pull off the deal, however, they mortgaged the team to the Connecticut General Life Insurance Company (now part of CIGNA). [...] Yearly payments of $200,000 drained the team of badly needed capital, and ended any realistic chance of the A's winning again under the Macks' stewardship.|$|E

He played Max Vandenburg in <b>the</b> film adaptation <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Book Thief (2013). He played Mark Ashton in the movie Pride, released in 2014, and his performance drew positive reviews. Charlotte O'Sullivan, writing for the London Evening Standard, said: [...] "Schnetzer is a New Yorker with an unpromising CV (he was one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> good <b>things</b> about <b>The</b> Book Thief) and he's fantastic here".|$|R

40|$|THE {{observation}} that Sabah and Sarawak are living examples <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1 Malaysia concept cannot {{get a better}} endorsement than from the prime minister himself.

2500|$|The Ganges is the {{embodiment}} of all sacred waters in Hindu mythology. Local rivers {{are said to be}} like the Ganges, and are sometimes called the local Ganges (Ganga). The Kaveri river of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu in Southern India is called the Ganges of the South; the Godavari, is the Ganges that was led by the sage Gautama to flow through Central India. The Ganges is invoked whenever water is used in Hindu ritual, and is therefore present in all sacred waters. In spite of this, nothing is more stirring for a Hindu than a dip in the actual river, which is thought to remit sins, especially at one of the famous tirthas such as Gangotri, Haridwar, Prayag, or Varanasi. The symbolic and religious importance of the Ganges is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> that Hindu India, even its skeptics, are agreed upon. Jawaharlal Nehru, a religious iconoclast himself, asked for a handful of his ashes to be thrown into the Ganges. [...] "The Ganga," [...] he wrote in his will, [...] "is the river of India, beloved of her people, round which are intertwined her racial memories, her hopes and fears, her songs of triumph, her victories and her defeats. She has been a symbol of India's age-long culture and civilization, ever-changing, ever-flowing, and yet ever the same Ganga." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cornholio is an {{alter ego}} of Beavis. Though the Cornholio {{character}} {{was developed in}} the episode [...] "The Great Cornholio", Beavis first plays the entity as a passing gag in [...] "Generation in Crisis". Beavis sometimes undergoes a radical personality change, usually after consuming large amounts of sugar and/or caffeine. In [...] "Holy Cornholio", the transformation occurs after Beavis takes many pain pills. He pulls his shirt collar over his head, raises his forearms in a 90-degree angle next to his chest, and then begins to yell or scream erratically, producing a stream of gibberish and strange noises, his eyes wide. Cornholio is a normally dormant persona (apparently the name is derived from the word [...] "cornhole"). Cornholio tends to wander aimlessly while reciting [...] "I am the Great Cornholio! I need TP for my bunghole!" [...] in an odd faux-Spanish accent. Sometimes Beavis will momentarily talk normally before resuming the persona of Cornholio. When he stops acting as the Cornholio persona, Beavis usually has no memory of what happened. In the guise of Cornholio, Beavis becomes a successful beat poet. In [...] "Vaya Con Cornholio" [...] he is deported to Mexico after wrongfully being subjected to immigration detention by an agent of the INS. During his detention the agent and his superior attempt {{to make sense of the}} gibberish, going so far as to look up the definition of [...] "bunghole". In that same episode, he claims to be from Lake Titicaca (because of the scatological sound of its name), but when asked where it is, he responds (incorrectly) with [...] "Nicaragua". Nicaragua may be one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>few</b> <b>things</b> Beavis remembers from class lectures. Beavis' teacher Mr. Van Driessen refers to Nicaragua during a lecture on world economic systems in [...] "The Great Cornholio", after which Beavis repeats the word while pacing back and forth in the classroom. Cornholio resurfaces in Bungholio, Lord of the Harvest, which he steals candy from everyone and Butt-Head tails him. He had stood up to Todd Ianuzzi, who demanded he move out of the road. He prepared to beat Beavis up in his Cornholio form with his friends. He later spares Beavis deeming him too insane, in favor of beating up the saner Butt-Head.|$|E
