5|$|Lyon {{represented}} Vermont in Congress from 1797 to 1801, {{and represented}} Kentucky from 1803 to 1811. His tenure in Congress was tumultuous.

5|$|As radicalism {{took hold}} in Britain in the 1790s, Johnson became {{increasingly}} involved in its causes: {{he was a}} member of the Society for Constitutional Information, which was attempting to reform Parliament; he published works defending Dissenters after the religiously motivated Birmingham Riots in 1791; and he testified on behalf of those arrested during the 1794 Treason Trials. Johnson published works championing the rights of slaves, Jews, women, prisoners, Dissenters, chimney sweeps, abused animals, university students forbidden from marrying, victims of press gangs, and those unjustly accused <b>of</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> game laws.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Woods and golfer Arnold Palmer {{initiated}} {{a case against}} Bruce Matthews (the owner of Gotta Have It Golf, Inc.) {{and others in the}} effort to stop the unauthorized sale of their images and alleged signatures in the memorabilia market. Matthews and associated parties counterclaimed that Woods and his company, ETW Corporation, committed several acts including breach of contract, breach of implied duty of good faith, and violations of Florida's Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. Palmer was also named in the counter-suit, accused <b>of</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> same licensing agreement in conjunction with his company Arnold Palmer Enterprises.|$|E

5|$|Lyon {{also has}} the {{distinction}} of being the only person to be elected to Congress while in jail. On October 10, 1798, he was found guilty <b>of</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> Alien and Sedition Acts, which prohibited malicious writing about the American government as a whole, or of the houses of Congress, or of the president. During the Quasi War with France, Lyon {{was the first person to}} be put to trial for violating the acts after he published editorials criticizing Federalist President John Adams.|$|E

5|$|Never one to shy from violent conflicts, Haywood was {{frequently}} {{the target of}} prosecutors.

In 1921, while out of prison during an appeal of his conviction, Haywood fled to Bolshevik Russia, where he spent the remaining years of his life.|$|E
5|$|Tự Đức {{continued}} {{to hope that}} Vietnamese compliance with the treaty would convince France to return the three southern provinces. In the words of Gian, Vietnam's full cooperation with the 1862 treaty was necessary to maintain {{the possibility of a}} territorial retrocession. The French officers in Saigon, the capital of Cochinchina, frequently accused the Nguyễn court <b>of</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> treaty by quietly supporting continued resistance. In 1867, they took this as a pretext to seize the other three provinces in southern Vietnam: Vĩnh Long, Hà Tiên and An Giang.|$|E
5|$|Accusing the Song <b>of</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> {{agreement}} and realizing {{the weakness of}} the Song, the Jin generals launched a second punitive campaign, again dividing their troops into two armies. Wanyan Zonghan, who had withdrawn from Taiyuan after the Kaifeng {{agreement and}} left a small force in charge of the siege, came back with his western army. Overwhelmed, Taiyuan fell in September 1126, after 260 days of siege. When the Song court received news of the fall of Taiyuan, the officials who had advocated defending the empire militarily fell from favor again and were replaced by counselors who favored appeasement. In mid December the two Jurchen armies converged on Kaifeng for the second time that year.|$|E

5|$|In May 2005, {{opposition}} MP Gurmant Grewal accused Dosanjh and the Prime Minister's Chief of Staff, Tim Murphy, {{of attempting}} to bribe him with an ambassadorship and a senate seat for his wife, Nina Grewal, if he would cross the floor or abstain from a crucial upcoming vote. Grewal released tapes he secretly recorded of the conversation between Dosanjh, Grewal, and Murphy. Dosanjh claimed innocence and accused Grewal of altering the tapes to imply wrongdoing and the Prime Minister dismissed calls to remove Dosanjh from cabinet. Audio analysis concluded that the tapes were altered and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police did not pursue any criminal investigations. Nevertheless, fellow MP John Reynolds {{filed a complaint with}} the Law Society of British Columbia accusing Dosanjh <b>of</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> Criminal Code and the society's Professional Conduct Handbook. The Law Society reviewed the affair and concluded that Grewal had attempted to elicit rewards for his compliance but cleared Dosanjh and Murphy of misconduct charges.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Franklin {{participated in}} an {{organized}} campaign to win the right for conscientious objectors to redirect part of their income taxes from military uses to peaceful purposes. Her 1987 paper, written to support the campaign, argued that the well-recognized right to refuse military service on grounds of conscience should be extended to include the right to refuse to pay taxes for war preparations. Franklin asserted that the freedom of conscience provision of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guaranteed this form of conscientious objection. Her paper was {{to be part of}} an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The lower courts had convicted those withholding part of their taxes <b>of</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> Income Tax Act. In 1990 however, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.|$|E
5|$|Keeping up {{the longstanding}} {{tradition}} of Massachusetts Bay, Phips {{fought against the}} office of custom inspectors, arguing that the port of Massachusetts did not see enough enumerated goods to warrant their presence. Instead Phips attempted to re-establish a naval office, with himself acting {{as head of the}} admiralty, thereby doling out favors to gain the support of the powerful merchant class. This was part of an old turf battle between the Admiralty and Customs but it led to an altercation with Randolph's custom inspector, Jahleel Brenton, which seemed to follow the similar embarrassing and unseemly pattern as his altercation with Captain Short. The two altercations weighed together against Phips. Phips was accused <b>of</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> Navigation Acts, as his predecessor had been. Blathwayt was slowly and steadily working to standardize the flow of tributes from the colonies to the Crown, and if Phips was clogging these pipes he would need to answer for it.|$|E

5|$|The Smith Act {{trials of}} Communist Party leaders were {{a series of}} federal prosecutions {{conducted}} from 1949 to 1958 in which leaders of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) were accused <b>of</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> Smith Act, a statute which imposed penalties on those who advocated violent overthrow of the government. The prosecution argued that the CPUSA's policies promoted violent revolution; the defendants countered that they advocated a peaceful transition to socialism, and that the First Amendment's guarantee {{of freedom of speech}} and of association protected their membership of a political party. The trials led to the US Supreme Court decisions Dennis v. United States (1951) and Yates v. United States (1957).|$|E
5|$|A.J. Styles went on {{to defend}} the TNA X Division Championship against Samoa Joe at Turning Point. This defense was due to Styles accusing Joe <b>of</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> unwritten X Division code. Styles then {{challenged}} Joe to a TNA X Division Championship match at Turning Point which Joe accepted on the November19 episode of Impact!. Joe defeated Styles at the show to become the new TNA X Division Champion. After the bout, Joe attempted to assault Styles {{in the same manner}} he did with Daniels until Daniels returned from injury to save Styles. This continued a rivalry between the three wrestlers as Joe {{went on to}} defend the title against Daniels at TNA's Final Resolution PPV event on January15, 2006, which Joe won to retain the title. At TNA's Against All Odds PPV event on February12, 2006, Daniels, Joe, and Styles competed in a Three Way match for the TNA X Division Championship; Joe gained the pinfall to retain the title. The three competed again, but this time in a Three Way Ultimate X match for the championship at TNA's Destination X PPV event on March12, 2006. Daniels won the bout, thus becoming the new TNA X Division Champion. The rivalry ended on the April13, 2006 episode of Impact! when Joe defeated Daniels to win back the championship.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, {{the leader}} of the North Carolina branch of the CPUSA, Junius Scales, became the final CPUSA member convicted under the Smith Act, and the only one convicted after the Yates decision. Prosecutors pursued Scales' case because he {{specifically}} advocated violent political action and gave demonstrations of martial arts skills. Scales was accused <b>of</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> membership clause of the Smith Act, not the clause prohibiting advocacy of violence against the government. In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Scales contended that the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act rendered the Smith Act's membership clause ineffective, because the McCarran Act explicitly stated that membership in a communist party does not constitute a per se violation of any criminal statute. In 1961, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, upheld Scales' conviction, finding that the Smith Act membership clause was not obviated by the McCarran Act, because the Smith Act required prosecutors to prove first, that there was direct advocacy of violence; and second, that the defendant's membership was substantial and active, not merely passive or technical. Two Justices of the Supreme Court who had supported the Yates decision in 1957, Harlan and Frankfurter, voted to uphold Scales' conviction.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, Hungry Jack's renewed its {{franchise}} agreement with then BK parent Burger King Corporation, which allowed Hungry Jack's to license third party franchisee. One {{of the terms}} and conditions of the renewed agreement required Hungry Jack's to open a minimum number of new locations each year {{for the duration of}} the contract. Shortly after the Australian trademark on the Burger King name lapsed in 1996, Burger King requested that Cowin rebrand the Hungry Jack's locations to Burger King, which Cowin declined. Burger King Corporation accused Hungry Jack's <b>of</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> conditions of the renewed {{franchise agreement}} by failing to expand the chain at the rate defined and sought to terminate the agreement. Under the aegis of this claim, Burger King Corporation, in partnership with Royal Dutch Shell's Australian division Shell Company of Australia Ltd., began to open its own stores in 1997 beginning in Sydney and extending throughout the regions of New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory and Victoria. In addition, BK sought to limit HJ's ability to open new locations in the country, whether they were corporate locations or third-party licensees.|$|E
5|$|In May 1995, Belarus held a {{referendum}} on changing its national symbols; the referendum also made the Russian language equal to Belarusian, and forged closer economic ties to Russia. Lukashenko was also given the ability to disband the Supreme Soviet by decree. In the summer of 1996, deputies of the 199-member Belarusian parliament signed a petition to impeach Lukashenko on charges <b>of</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> Constitution. Shortly after that, {{a referendum}} was held on 24 November 1996 in which four questions were offered by Lukashenko and three offered {{by a group of}} Parliament members. The questions ranged from social issues (changing independence day to 3 July, abolition of the death penalty) to the national constitution. As a result of the referendum, the constitution that was amended by Lukashenko was accepted and the one amended by the Supreme Soviet was voided. The new document dramatically increased Lukashenko's power and transformed his presidency into a de facto legal dictatorship. His decrees now had the force of law, and he also acquired near-total control over government spending. On 25 November, it was announced that 70.5% of voters, of an 84% turnout, had approved the amended constitution. The US and the EU, however, refused to accept the legitimacy of the referendum.|$|E
5|$|Joseph's {{reforms were}} deeply unpopular within the Austrian Netherlands. The Enlightenment had made few inroads into the territory, {{and it was}} widely distrusted as a foreign {{phenomenon}} which was not compatible with traditional local values. The majority of the population, especially influenced by the Church, believed the reforms {{to be a threat}} to their own cultures and traditions which would leave them worse off. Even in pro-Enlightenment circles, the reforms caused discontent which were seen as not sufficiently radical and not far reaching enough. Popular opposition was centered on the provincial states, in particular Hainaut, Brabant and Flanders, as well as their law courts. There was a wave of critical pamphleting. In some towns, riots broke out and the militia had to be called to suppress them. The Estate of Brabant called a lawyer, Hendrik Van der Noot, to defend their position publicly. Van der Noot publicly accused the reforms <b>of</b> <b>violating</b> <b>the</b> precedents established by the Joyous Entry of 1356 which was widely regarded as a traditional bill of rights for the region.|$|E
