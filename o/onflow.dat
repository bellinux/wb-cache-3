6000|$|I {{have been}} chary of {{gratuitous}} {{interference with the}} punctuation of the manuscripts and early editions; in this direction, however, some revision was indispensable. Even in his most carefully finished [...] "fair copy" [...] Shelley under-punctuates (Thus in the exquisite autograph [...] "Hunt MS." [...] of [...] "Julian and Maddalo", Mr. Buxton Forman, the most conservative of editors, finds it necessary to supplement Shelley's punctuation in no fewer than ninety-four places.), and sometimes punctuates capriciously. In {{the very act of}} transcribing his mind was apt to stray from the work in hand to higher things; he would lose himself in contemplating those airy abstractions and lofty visions of which alone he greatly cared to sing, to the neglect and detriment of the merely external and formal element of his song. Shelley recked little of the jots and tittles of literary craftsmanship; he committed many a small sin against the rules of grammar, and certainly paid but a halting attention to the nice distinctions of punctuation. Thus in the early editions a comma occasionally plays the part of a semicolon; colons and semicolons seem to be employed interchangeably; a semicolon almost invariably appears where nowadays we should employ the dash; and, lastly, the dash itself becomes a point of all work, replacing indifferently commas, colons, semicolons or periods. Inadequate and sometimes haphazard as it is, however, Shelley's punctuation, so far as it goes, is of great value as an index to his metrical, or at times, it may be, to his rhetorical intention--for, in Shelley's hands, punctuation serves rather to mark the rhythmical pause and <b>onflow</b> of the verse, or to secure some declamatory effect, than to indicate the structure or elucidate the sense. For this reason the original pointing has been retained, save where it tends to obscure or pervert the poet's meaning. Amongst the Editor's Notes {{at the end of the}} Volume 3 the reader will find lists of the punctual variations in the longer poems, by means of which the supplementary points now added may be identified, and the original points, which in this edition have been deleted or else replaced by others, ascertained, in the order of their occurrence. In the use of capitals Shelley's practice has been followed, while an attempt has been made to reduce the number of his inconsistencies in this regard.|$|E

40|$|The {{main subject}} of this work is a self-consistent {{investigation}} {{of the interaction between}} an electrodynamic tethered satellite system and the ambient plasma of the Earth's ionosphere. Using a new three-dimensional, nonlinear model within the framework of resistive magnetohydrodynamics this work tries {{for the first time to}} describe the plasma's behaviour in the region adjacent to the subsatellites' nearfield by self-consistent simulations. For the first time it can be demonstrated that an electrodynamic tether generates nonlinear wave modes being combined with strong perturbations of the ambient plasma. These perturbations consist of a significant diversion of the <b>onflowing</b> plasma coupled with strong density and pressure gradients which extend into the direction of the magnetic field and form large perturbation wings. The size of these wings is mainly determined by the resistivity of the ionospheric plasma. It is shown that due to nonlinear effects a large part of the tether current is closed within the perturbation wings. Furthermore, the extension of the tether current within the plasma environment can be divided in two different portions. On of these portions consists of the current tubes connected with the divided in two different portions. One of these portions consists of the current tubes connected with the subsatellites which develop into the wellkown. Alfven-wings at a distance where the non-linearities vanish. The other portion of the tether current closes within the nonlinear perturbation wing with the fraction of the current closure depending mainly on the tether length. With the aid of two-dimensional simulations it can be pointed out that this fraction is at least 25 % of the total current. (orig.) 57 refs.

40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} {{development}} of military unmanned air vehicles and especially due to associated progresses in control and guidance technology it might be beneficial to use these technologies for civilian air transport, especially for unmanned cargo air frighters (UCAF). In particular, from the control and guidance technology side most of the challenges have been or will be mastered in the near future. Taking into account the potential advantages of unmanned flight in regard to safety issues and rules, significant economical and ecological potentials of UCAFs could be opened, when UCAFs would fly in close formation. Inspired by nature formation flight has been investigated by a various number of researchers and coworkers, {{it has been shown}} that in regard to fuel consumption certain formations show a great impact. This has been extensively tested by NASA. Other studies concentrated on wing shape optimisation in order to achieve best additional lift results at low admittable drag. Typically air frighters are only variations of civilian passenger aircrafts. For these manned aircraft the certification rules of the FAA would not allow to flight in a close formation. Even more, from the aerodynamic design point of view the current aircrafts are not able to make use of the positive aerodynamical effects of formation flight efficiently. Therefore, other completely different aircraft designs are necessary. One of the most promissing concept is the so called “oblique flying wing” (OFW), an aircraft which fuselage is integrated in the wing and which has a shock free wing shape design. This concept has been extensively investigated by Sobieczky. The speciality of OFWs is that due to its curved wing shape and its extremely slim camber shocks can be avoided even for high Ma number flows: The adjustable sweep angle and angle of attack allows shock free flow regimes over a wide range of high Mach numbers. In this numerical flow simulation study we are focusing on oblique flying wings in formation flight. In the first part of the work we will concentrate on the flow structure of formation flight, in particular, we will investigate the impact of the wing tip vortices of the front OFW on the flow structure at the following OFW. This is necessary in order to find best positions in the formation in regard to the feasibility to capture additional lift induced by the <b>onflowing</b> vortex. In particular, flying in the presence of trailing vortices is an unstable flight condition. Furthermore, since the vortex decays quickly, it is crucial to fly very close to the optimal lateral and vertical position in order to get the maximum additional lift and reduced drag. This is complicated by the fact that the vortex from the leading plane is deformed by the motion of the ambient air, including the movement induced by the presence of the trailing aircraft itself. Therefore, our further focal points are the manoeuvers in the vortical wake flow of the leading aircraft and the sensitivity against slight changes of the position in relation to the wing tip vortex generated by the leading aircraft. Before going into details the underlying grid generation, the used CFD code and the relevant CFD simulation setup will be explained. Additionally, the grid deformation technique, used for shape adaptation and positioning of the OFWs in the aircraft flight formation, will be reflected. Thereafter, the design concept of OFW will be briefly introduced. Special attention will be given to the design methodology, before the flow characteristics around an OFW will be exemplarily explained. In a short manner main aspects of the flow field will be presented Based on the CFD results the analysis will concentrate on the tip vortex OFW interaction. Thereafter, the position of the OFWs in the formation in relation to each other will be varied, the flow simulation results will be compared and discussed. Subsequently, an evaluation of the positioning and shape adaptation in regard to harvesting energy will be presented and summarized, followed by a discussion of OFW design variations.

40|$|The present thesis {{deals with}} the online-coupling of size {{exclusion}} chromatography (SEC) and liquid chromatography at critical conditions (LCCC) with NMR spectroscopy in order to characterize polymers and determine their molar masses. In this regard it was the aim to establish the coupled techniques that way that they were working with common chromatographic conditions, e. g. sample concentration, flow rate and solvents. The measurements should result in quantitative characterizations. The difficulty with NMR measurements on the flowing medium (<b>onflow)</b> was that nuclei only have a limited residence time in the detection cell, while NMR spectroscopy has to wait for relaxation of the nuclei during accumulation of the spectra. Conclusively, NMR measurement parameters should fulfill the given contrary conditions. To find a suitable set of NMR parameters, the behaviour of nuclei in the magnetic field under flow conditions was evaluated, especially regarding T 1 relaxation and its influence on signal intensities. By varying the flow rate, the pulse repetition time and the pulse angle {{it was found that}} quantitative results were obtainable only by using uncommon chromatographic conditions or not useful NMR parameters. However, based on these results a method was developed to evaluate and correct the errors in not quantitative NMR data. Therefore, it was possible to quantify data from SEC-NMR and LCCC-NMR measurements although they were performed with not quantitative conditions. Thus, the evaluation of the reciprocal influences of chromatographic and NMR spectroscopic parameters resulted in a new method in HPLC-NMR applications. In the following, a new <b>onflow</b> SEC-NMR coupling was developed and presented by characterizing a number of polystyrene-polymethyl methacrylate (PS-b-PMMA) and polyisopren-polymethyl methacrylate (PI-b-PMMA) block copolymers. In all cases, THF was used as solvent at a flow rate of 0. 8 mL. min- 1. In the <b>onflow</b> NMR spectra, signals of all blocks could be identified over the entire elution period: PS blocks were quantified by the signals of the aromatic protons, PMMA blocks by the signals of the a-CH 3 group and PI by the signals of the olefinic protons. Thus, SEC chromatograms could be obtained directly from the SEC-NMR data for all blocks of the PS-b-PMMA and PI-b-PMMA copolymers {{as well as for the}} copolymers themselves. In addition, the microstructure of PMMA blocks could be analyzed in dependence on retention time, while for PI the different isomeric species of isoprene units in the polymer chains could by characterized. For the copolymers, chemical heterogeneities could be calculated directly from the chromatograms. Calibration of the SEC-NMR system with defined polymer standard samples allowed for molar mass determination. For one of the PI-b-PMMA copolymers a method was developed to separate coeluting fractions of co- and homopolymers by a mathematical procedure. For this, knowledge of the chemical heterogeneity of the sample was essential. The possibility to distinguish between the different species in copolymers is a significant advantage of NMR spectroscopy. As an alternative, a series of different detectors can be used (multiple detection, e. g. combined UV and refractive index detection). However, multiple detection is time consuming due to additional calibrations and mathematical efforts. The use of NMR spectroscopy is furthermore beneficial when the distinction of different species by multiple detection is impossible (e. g. microstructure heterogeneities). With respect to copolymer molar masses, a good agreement between <b>onflow</b> SEC-NMR and SEC-RI-UV was found. However, number average molar masses Mn determined by <b>onflow</b> SEC-NMR were smaller due to the influence of the large detection cell. The new <b>onflow</b> SEC-NMR method uses calibrations for molar mass determinations as it is common in SEC and is therefore a relative procedure. By NMR detection, molar masses can be calculated also in an absolute way, when NMR signals of end or linking groups of the polymers can be identified over the elution period. This was possible for four short PI-b-PMMA copolymers which were linked by a diphenylethylene (DPE) group each. The corresponding NMR signals could be used as an internal reference for direct block length calculation. The resulting absolute molar masses were smaller than those determined by the relative method. The interpretation of this finding was that the hydrodynamic volumes of the blocks did not contribute simply additive to the block copolymer volumes but that additional repulsive effects result in increased hydrodynamic volumes of the block copolymers. Another new online-SEC-NMR method developed and presented in this thesis was called fractionated SEC-NMR. Hereby, SEC peaks were identified with a UV detector and then directed to a number of capillary loops for fractionation. After the chromatography was finished, the pump was used to transfer each collected fraction sequentially to the NMR flow probe where measurements were performed without a flowing mobile phase. Consequently, the nuclei had sufficient time for full relaxation during accumulation of a NMR spectrum. The fractionated SEC-NMR had all advantages of the <b>onflow</b> method and additionally provided correct Mn values. Moreover, it also allowed for the detection of insensitive nuclei which was proved with a deuterated PS-b-PMMA copolymer (2 H detection). The coupling of LCCC and NMR was applied to separate and characterize blends of different PI samples. This work continued and extended a work which was presented in a former thesis by Pritish Sinha (TU Darmstadt, Germany, 2009). The blends contained PI samples which were dominated by 1, 4 -isoprene units as well as samples which were built mainly by 3, 4 -isoprene. Critical conditions for PI(1, 4) samples were used which simultaneously led to SEC elution of the PI(3, 4) samples. This allowed for the separation and characterization of the mixtures. The NMR signals of the olefinic protons were used to obtain chromatograms for all isomeric species of the isoprene units in the polymer chains as well as the isomeric compositions in dependence on retention time. The separation could be further improved by a mathematical procedure. In this way, the compositions of the mixtures of samples could be efficiently calculated via the isomer amounts. Molar mass determination for the PI(3, 4) samples could be performed on the basis of a calibration curve. It was found in all cases that the resulting Mn values were significantly to small. This was caused by the 1, 4 -isomers in the PI(3, 4) samples which stretched the chromatograms in the direction of the PI(1, 4) critical retention time. Due to this finding, molar mass determination from LCCC-NMR data is limited. In the last chapter the short PI-b-PMMA copolymers have been analyzed by LCCC-NMR with PI eluting in critical mode and PMMA in SEC regime. Molar masses for the PMMA blocks were calculated on the basis of a calibration curve. Alternatively, molar mass determination was possible from direct block length calculation by using the DPE signals as internal reference. The resulting values from the calibration method were too small especially in case of Mn. The chromatographic effect causing this was also found and discussed for the PI blends. In contrast to that finding, the internal referencing procedure by the DPE signals was not influenced by that effect and hence resulted in realistic molar masses. Furthermore, very good accordance was found to the molar masses determined absolutely from SEC-NMR measurements. Consequently, effects leading to peak shape deformation or retention time shift have no influence on the absolute molar mass determination method. This can be explained by the fact that it does not rely on calibration curves which are not necessarily influenced in the same way as the samples. For using the absolute method it is essential to detect signals of end or linking groups which for small polymers is possible by using NMR detection. Finally, an electronic reference signal was implemented in the LCCC-NMR spectra which allowed for conversion of the chromatograms to molar amount and to mass related curves. It was seen that for depiction of LCCC-NMR chromatograms substance amounts in the order of 10 - 8 mol to 10 - 7 mol and 10 - 6 g to 10 - 5 g, respectively, per <b>onflow</b> spectrum were sufficient. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der online-Kopplung von Größenausschluss- Chromatographie (SEC) und Chromatographie unter kritischen Bedingungen (LCCC) mit der NMR-Spektroskopie zum Zwecke der Charakterisierung und Molmassenbestimmung von Polymeren. Dabei wurde besonders darauf Wert gelegt, die Kopplungen so auszulegen, dass SEC-NMR- und LCCC-NMR-Messungen hinsichtlich der Probenkonzentration, der Flussrate und der Lösungsmittel unter chromatographisch üblichen Bedingungen durchgeführt werden konnten. Die erhaltenen Resultate sollten quantitativ verwertbar und interpretierbar sein. Die Schwierigkeit bei NMR-Messungen am fließenden Medium (<b>onflow)</b> bestand dabei darin, dass sich Kerne nur für eine begrenzte Zeit innerhalb der Detektionszelle befanden, die NMR-Spektroskopie bei der Akkumulation von Messdaten jedoch die zur Kernrelaxation benötigte Zeit berücksichtigen musste. NMR-Messparameter sollten folglich den genannten konträren Voraussetzungen gerecht werden können. Um die geforderten Messparameter festlegen zu können, wurde zunächst untersucht, wie sich Kerne unter Flussbedingungen im Magnetfeld verhalten, insbesondere hinsichtlich der T 1 -Relaxation und deren Auswirkung auf die gemessene Signalintensität. Durch Variation der Flussrate, der Wartezeit zwischen zwei Auslenkungen und dem Auslenkungswinkel wurde festgestellt, dass quantitative Ergebnisse auf direktem Weg nur unter Verwendung untypischer chromatographischer Bedingungen oder nicht sinnvoller NMR-Messparameter erhalten werden können. Allerdings wurde auf Basis dieser Untersuchungen eine Methode entwickelt, mit der die Fehler in nicht quantitativen Messdaten bestimmt und korrigiert werden konnten. Mithilfe dieses Ergebnisses war es in der Folge möglich, SEC-NMR und LCCC-NMR-Messungen durchzuführen, die trotz fehlerbehafteter Rohdaten quantitativ ausgewertet und interpretiert werden konnten. Insofern führte die Evaluierung der wechselseitigen Einflüsse von chromatographischen und NMR-spektroskopischen Parametern zu einer neuen Messmethodik in HPLC-NMR-Kopplungen. Mit den gewonnenen Kenntnissen wurde eine neue <b>onflow</b> SEC-NMR-Kopplung präsentiert. Als Proben standen dabei verschiedene Block-Copolymere zur Verfügung. Es wurden Polystyrol-Polymethylmethacrylat- (PS-b-PMMA) und Polyisopren-Polymethylmethacrylat- Block-Copolymere (PI-b-PMMA) untersucht. Als Lösungsmittel wurde in beiden Fällen THF bei einer Flussrate von 0, 8 mL. min- 1 eingesetzt. In den <b>onflow</b> NMR-Spektren konnten Signale aller Blöcke identifiziert und über den Retentionszeitverlauf verfolgt werden: PS-Blöcke wurden durch die Signale der aromatischen Protonen, PMMA-Blöcke durch die Signale der a-CH 3 -Gruppe und PI-Blöcke durch die Signale der olefinischen Protonen quantifiziert. Infolge dessen waren SEC-Chromatogramme für alle Blöcke der PS-b-PMMAund der PI-b-PMMA-Copolymere sowie für die Copolymere selbst aus den Messdaten direkt zugänglich. Für die PMMA-Blöcke konnte außerdem die Mikrostruktur in Abhängigkeit von der SEC-Retentionszeit untersucht werden, während bei den PI-Blöcken die verschiedenen isomeren Formen der Isopren-Einheiten charakterisierbar waren. Weiterhin konnten die chemischen Heterogenitäten der Copolymere, also die Veränderungen der molaren Copolymer-Zusammensetzungen in Abhängigkeit von den Copolymer-Molmassen, direkt aus den Chromatogrammen ermittelt werden. Durch Kalibrierung des SEC-NMR-Systems mit definierten Polymerstandards war es schließlich möglich, die Molmassen der Copolymere zu bestimmen. Für ein PI-b-PMMA-Copolymer wurde ferner eine Möglichkeit aufgezeigt, coeluierende Fraktionen von Copolymeren und Homopolymeren mathematisch zu trennen. Für diese Prozedur war die Kenntnis über die chemische Heterogenität der Probe unverzichtbar. Die Möglichkeit, verschiedene Polymer-Spezies mit nur einem Detektor voneinander zu unterscheiden, ist ein bedeutender Vorteil der NMR-Spektroskopie. Alternativ bietet sich zur Bestimmung der chemischen Heterogenität die Verwendung verschiedener in Reihe geschalteter Detektoren an (multiple Detektion, z. B. UV- und Brechungsindex- Detektoren), die jedoch aufgrund weiterer Kalibrierungen und mathematischer Prozeduren einen höheren Aufwand erfordert. Weiterhin ist die NMR-Detektion vorteilhaft, wenn mittels multipler Detektion die Unterscheidung verschiedener Spezies nicht möglich ist (wie häufig bei mikrostrukturellen Heterogenitäten). In Bezug auf die Copolymer-Molmassen zeigte sich eine gute Übereinstimmung zwischen <b>onflow</b> SEC-NMR und SEC-RI-UV; allerdings wurden die zahlenmittleren Molmassen Mn durch <b>onflow</b> SEC-NMR zu klein bestimmt, was auf den Einfluss der Flusszelle im NMR-Probenkopf zurückgeführt wurde. Die beschriebene neue <b>onflow</b> SEC-NMR-Methode nutzte wie in der SEC üblich Kalibrierungen zur Molmassenbestimmung und war somit eine relative Methode. Durch die NMR-Detektion können Molmassen allerdings auch absolut bestimmt werden, wenn das NMR-Signal einer End- oder Brückengruppe des Polymers über den Retentionszeitverlauf verfolgt werden kann. Dies war für vier kurze PI-b-PMMA-Copolymere möglich, deren Blöcke durch je eine Diphenylethylen-Einheit miteinander verbunden waren. Die zugehörigen Signale konnten als interne Referenz verwendet werden, um die Blocklängen der PI- und PMMA-Blöcke direkt zu berechnen. Die daraus erhaltenen Molmassen waren im Vergleich zu denen aus der Relativ-Methode kleiner. Die Interpretation dieses Vergleichs führte zu dem Schluss, dass sich die hydrodynamischen Volumina der PI-b-PMMA-Copolymere nicht additiv aus den Volumina seiner Blöcke zusammensetzt, sondern dass zusätzlich abstoßende Effekte für eine Volumensvergrößerung sorgen müssen. Eine weitere neu entwickelte und in dieser Arbeit vorgestellte online-Kopplung von SEC und NMR ist die fraktionierte SEC-NMR. Hierbei wurden SEC-Peaks von PS-b-PMMACopolymeren zunächst mittels UV-Detektion identifiziert und im Anschluss in Kapillarschleifen fraktioniert. Nach Abschluss der Chromatographie wurde die Pumpe dazu eingesetzt, die einzelnen Fraktionen nacheinander in den NMR-Flussprobenkopf zu transferieren, wo sie ohne Fluss gemessen werden konnten. Aus diesem Grund konnte auch auf die T 1 -Relaxationszeit der Kerne Rücksicht genommen werden. Für die fraktionierte SEC-NMR galten alle Vorteile der onflow-Methode; zusätzlich gab sie Mn- Werte korrekt wieder und ließ auch die Detektion unempfindlicher Kerne zu, wie anhand eines vollständig deuterierten PS-b-PMMA-Copolymers gezeigt werden konnte. Die Kopplung von LCCC mit NMR wurde zunächst zur Trennung und Charakterisierung von PI-Mischungen angewendet. Damit wurde eine bereits vorher in der Dissertationsschrift von Pritish Sinha (TU Darmstadt, Deutschland, 2009) vorgestellte Arbeit fortgesetzt und vertieft. Die Mischungen enthielten sowohl PI-Proben, die durch das 1, 4 -Isomer dominiert wurden als auch solche, die mehrheitlich durch das 3, 4 -Isomer gebildet waren. Kritische Bedingungen galten für PI(1, 4) -Proben, während die PI(3, 4) -Proben gleichzeitig im SEC-Modus eluierten. Dadurch konnten die Mischungen getrennt und mittels NMR-Detektion charakterisiert werden. Die Signale der olefinischen Protonen konnten genutzt werden, um Chromatogramme für alle vorkommenden isomeren Formen des PI darzustellen und den Verlauf der Zusammensetzung in Abhängigkeit von der Retentionszeit zu verfolgen. Die Trennung der Mischungen konnte mathematisch optimiert werden. So konnte die molare Zusammensetzung der Mischungen über die Isomerenanteile effizient bestimmt werden. Für die PI(3, 4) -Proben wurde eine Molmassenbestimmung mithilfe einer Kalibrierkurve durchgeführt. Es wurde festgestellt, dass Mn in allen Fällen deutlich zu klein bestimmt wurde. Dies konnte auf die 1, 4 -Isopren-Einheiten in den PI(3, 4) -Proben zurückgeführt werden, welche die Elution der Proben in Richtung der kritischen Retentionszeit verbreiterten. Dieser Effekt führte zu der Erkenntnis, dass eine Molmassenbestimmung aus LCCC-NMR-Daten nur eingeschränkt möglich ist. Schließlich wurden auch die kurzkettigen PI-b-PMMA-Copolymere mittels LCCC-NMR untersucht. PI eluierte dabei kritisch und PMMA im SEC-Modus. Molmassen für die PMMABlöcke konnten durch Kalibrierung bestimmt werden. Alternativ bot sich hier auch wieder die direkte Berechnung der Blocklängen mithilfe des Signals der Diphenylethylen-Einheit an. Die aus der Kalibrierkurve berechneten Molmassen der PMMA-Blöcke zeichneten sich insbesondere für Mn durch zu kleine Werte und daraus resultierende hohe Polydispersitäten aus. Der zugrunde liegende chromatographische Effekt war bereits bei den PI-Mischungen festgestellt worden. Im Gegensatz dazu zeigte sich die Auswertung auf Basis der DPE-Referenz gegenüber dem chromatographischen Effekt unempfindlich und lieferte realistische Molmassen und kleine Polydispersitäten. Ferner ergaben sich sehr gute Übereinstimmungen der absolut bestimmten Molmassen zu den SEC-NMR-Messungen. Aus den Messergebnissen von SEC-NMR und LCCC-NMR konnte weiterhin gefolgert werden, dass Effekte, die Einflüsse auf die Peakformen oder die Retentionszeiten ausüben, für die Absolut-Methode keine Rolle spielen. Dies liegt insbesondere daran, dass die Absolut- Methode ohne Kalibrierungskurven auskommt, welche nicht zwangsläufig den gleichen Effekten unterliegen. Die Auswertung mit der Absolut-Methode erfordert, dass Signale von End- oder Brückengruppen detektierbar sind, was die NMR-Spektroskopie ermöglichen kann. Schließlich konnte mithilfe eines elektronisch erzeugten Referenzsignals gezeigt werden, dass die Intensitätsachsen der Chromatogramme sowohl in Stoffmengen- als auch in Massenachsen umgerechnet werden konnten. Daher konnte letztlich festgehalten werden, dass zur Darstellung von LCCC-NMR-Chromatogrammen bereits Substanzmengen in der Größenordnung von 10 - 8 mol bis 10 - 7 mol bzw. Substanzmassen in der Größenordnung von 10 - 6 g bis 10 - 5 g pro onflow-Spektrum hinreichend waren...|$|E
40|$|This {{study of}} Ralph Pred’s <b>Onflow</b> (MIT Press, 2005) expands on Pred’s {{arguments}} and raises {{doubts about the}} viability of phenomenology. Showing that Pred’s method is indeed phenomenological, I validate his interpretations of William James as phenomenologist and his critique of John Searle in light of James, which documents {{the extent to which}} the role of habit in the constitution of experience is neglected by philosophers. In explaining habit, however, Pred himself reverts to non-phenomenological models drawn from James’ postulate of psycho-physical parallelism. Habit, like causation, poses an unmet challenge to phenomenological methods. In his critique of Gerald Edelman, Pred notes that Edelman falls prey to a metaphysical bias inherent in modern Indo-European languages. But Pred’s acuity in exposing a latent linguistic bias in phenomenological data is a two-edged sword. Revealing an invisible dependence of appearance on language, it casts doubt on the project of getting beyond language to "appearances-in-themselves. ...|$|E

40|$|The present {{contribution}} outlines several selected {{applications of}} the MEGAFLOW software at DLR, roughly according to the time-frame of the MEGAFLOW II project from 1998 - 2002. The majority of the applications is based on 3 -dimensional viscous computations featuring {{the solution of the}} compressible Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equation in combination with one or two transport equation turbulence models. The examples highlight a quite broad range of applications. This refers to <b>onflow</b> speed as well as the the mode of application, covering analysis as well as design and optimization tasks. In general a clear trend {{in the use of the}} MEGAFLOW system becomes visible. On the hand the analyses of very specific flow and/or aircraft details on overall configurations of increasing complexity is carried out.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} a high lift segment using an unstructured RANS method shows, that a slat track can have a significant influence on the overall aerodynamic properties. Two track types are considered, one which is representative of a wind tunnel model, and a second one derived from an aircraft track. The major differences are the larger cross-section area of the model track, and the intersection with the fixed wing. The high lift devices are positioned in a landing setting. The <b>onflow</b> conditions refer to wind tunnel conditions. Periodic lateral boundary conditions are applied. Compared to a reference high lift wing segment without track, a 10 % increase in lift and a 20 % increase in drag is being computed for the model track. For the aircraft track only a minor lift change is found, but also a 20 % drag increase. Based {{on the outcome of}} the present investigations, the major impact of the lift is caused by the downstream shift of the stagnation line {{in the vicinity of the}} junction of the model track and the fixed wing...|$|E
40|$|<b>Onflow</b> {{offers a}} phenomenological account of consciousness. Pred takes his {{inspiration}} {{from the work of}} William James — in particular, from James ’ notion of the ‘Stream of Consciousness ’ [SC]. The first published example, in 1884, of this influential and highly suggestive metaphor is thought to have been by James {{who was one of the}} first scientific thinkers to take the idea seriously and investigate it from the viewpoint of what Pred terms ‘radical empiricism’, meaning, I think, that theory must be tested rigorously against personal experience and rejected if it doesn’t match up. James was not entirely on his own when it came to developing this approach to studying consciousness since Husserl was developing his phenomenology at roughly the same time and there is clear evidence that the two men were familiar with each other’s work. There is some debate about who influenced whom. One view is that Husserl owed a considerable debt to James. Either way, Pred is of the opinion that this particular brand of ontology has...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWhen an {{acoustic}} wave propagates in a fluid, it can generate a second order flowwhose characteristic time is {{much longer than}} the period of thewave. Within a range offrequency between ten and several hundred Hz, a relatively simple and versatile wayto generate streaming flow is to put a vibrating object in the fluid. The flow developsvortices in the viscous boundary layer located {{in the vicinity of}} the source of vibrations,leading in turn to an outer irrotational streaming called Rayleigh streaming. Becausethe flow originates from non-linear time-irreversible terms of the Navier-Stokes equation,this phenomenon can be used to generate efficient mixing at low Reynolds number,for instance in confined geometries. Here, we report on an experimental study ofsuch streaming flow induced by a vibrating beam in a Hele-Shaw cell of 2 mm spanusing long exposure flowvisualization and particle-image velocimetry measurements. Our study focuses especially on the effects of forcing frequency and amplitude <b>onflow</b> dynamics. It is shown that some features of this flow can be predicted by simplescaling arguments and that this vibration-induced streaming facilitates the generationof vortices...|$|E
40|$|The Chimera {{technique}} for moving grids {{is used to}} take into account non-homogeneous unsteady <b>onflow</b> conditions in the simulation of aerodynamic flows. The method is applied to simulate the transport of a large-scale vortex by a mean velocity field over a large distance, where it finally interacts with an airfoil. The Chimera approach allows to resolve the vortex on a fine grid, whereas the unstructured background grid covering most of the computational domain can be much coarser. This method shows the same low numerical dissipation as a simulation on a globally fine grid. Several precursor tests are performed with a finite modified analytical Lamb-Oseen type vortex, to study the influence of spatial and temporal resolution and the employed numerical scheme. Then the interaction of an analytical vortex with a NACA 0012 airfoil and with an ONERA-A airfoil near stall is studied. Finally a realistic vortex is generated by a ramping airfoil and is transported on a moving Chimera block and then interacts with a two-element airfoil, which allows to simulate a typical setup for a gust generator in aerodynamic facilities...|$|E

The work is dealing with the onset of the vortical flow at the leading edge for constant and variable leading edge nose radii, the influence of the angle of attack, the leading edge sweep and the <b>onflow</b> Mach number. Furthermore, the aerodynamic behavior is analyzed and assessed as well as the specific flow physics {{in the vicinity of the}} vortical flow separation at round leading edges. The objective of the present work is to provide a contribution for the design and assessment of the physical characteristics of swept wing configurations.

40|$|The present thesis {{considers}} the compressible Navier-Stokes equations {{to simulate the}} flow of air about basic and complex test cases. As numerical solution method the unstructured finite-volume solver DLR-TAU is used. The aim {{of the work is}} to provide a hybrid RANS/LES simulation strategy for the reliable numerical prediction of the stall behavior of high-lift airfoils under the influence of turbulent inflow. The focus is on the development of an improved modeling technique based on the Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) method. The DES combines two complementary modeling concepts: the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with high fidelity at a high computational effort, which is directly coupled to the flow Reynolds number, and the statistical approach to solve the Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with lower fidelity for separated flows but at a considerably lower computational effort. In the present thesis the Algebraic Delayed DES (ADDES) is extended, improved, and validated for several fundamental flow cases and application challenges. In the ADDES the distinction between RANS and LES zones is controlled by algebraic sensors, which detect the flow state by evaluating boundary layer velocity profiles. To allow for complex application cases, the evaluation of the boundary-layer properties is implemented in a fully parallelized algorithm, which can handle complex geometries. Furthermore, the ADDES is coupled with wall-modeled LES capabilities to provide a model for attached boundary layers with turbulent <b>onflow.</b> In order to mitigate the so-called grey-area problem at the RANS-to-LES interface, a vorticity-based LES filter width was adopted and reformulated for the unstructured dual-grid approach of TAU, in order to stimulate the generation of resolved turbulent structures. Moreover, a grid-resolution sensor for Large-Eddy Simulations is proposed, which enables assessing the grid from a single LES solution. This sensor can be used to control an automatic local grid adaptation in order to provide an appropriate spatial resolution for the respective flow problem. In the target application of the present thesis, the interaction of a generic airfoil generated vortex with a two-element high-lift airfoil is simulated. In a preliminary investigation the generation and transport of the <b>onflow</b> disturbance is isolated to determine the required level of modeling. In combination with the improved high-fidelity ADDES approach, the mean influence of the disturbance on the high-lift airfoil is successfully reproduced in the final target application. During the development of the improved simulation strategy, intermediate results were published at several work stages, as listed below.

40|$|We {{studied the}} flow and mixing regimes in {{isolated}} {{segments of the}} terminal ileum of brushtail possums during spontaneous circumferential and longitudinal contractions under conditions that allowed backflow and compared them with those of inactive segments. Residence time distributions (RTDs) were determined by perfusion with two probes of different rheological properties to which an inert dye marker was added. Ileal segment volume and oscillatory flow {{during the period of}} RTD determination were derived from spatiotemporal maps. High viscosity guar gum solution generated RTDs characteristic of laminar flow in inactive ileal segments which confirmed that no slip was occurring at the mucosal layer. In active segments, motility and consequent oscillatory flow imparted significant additional axial dispersion to the flow patterns of both probes. Mixing occurred episodically during periods when intestinal volume was reduced and <b>onflow</b> was augmented by peristalsis, which may prevent the establishment of steady state conditions. Marker concentration rose more steeply when active ileal segments were being perfused with a probe of similar viscosity to normal digesta than with low viscosity Earle's/Hepes solution, each being subject to similar levels of oscillatory flow. This indicated that a coarser mixing regime prevailed and that absorption of nutrients from viscous digesta would rely to a greater degree on molecular diffusion...|$|E
