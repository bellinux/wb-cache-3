In this paper, calcium–alginate beads {{have been}} {{manufactured}} by physically cross-linked technology, by dripping an aqueous alginate solution into {{a solution of}} calcium salt as a crosslinker. The effect of various elements controlling beads shape such as solution concentration, flow rate and {{the distance between the}} <b>orifice</b> <b>tip</b> and surface of the cross-linking solution were studied. The various elements affected the gelling rate and diameter and weight were studied. The findings indicated that shape of alginate beads in the hydrated state was strongly dependent on the flow rate and concentration of sodium alginate solutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of the inkjet method to pharmaceutical products is promising. To make this realistic, {{not only does the}} throughput of this method need to be increased, but also the components should be inert to pharmaceutical preparations. We present designs of glass‐based inkjet devices that are capable of producing droplets at high rates. To achieve this, inkjet devices from glass capillary tubes were manufactured with orifice diameters of 5, 10 and 20 μm and were actuated with diaphragm piezoelectric disks. Also, a pressure capsule was formed by creating a manifold at a distance from the <b>orifice</b> <b>tip.</b> Placing the piezoelectric disk at 0. 5 mm distance from the tip allowed the formation of a jet at 3. 2 MHz in certain designs, but {{for a short period of}} time because of overheating. The length of the pressure capsule, its inlet diameter, and the nozzle tip geometry were crucial to lower the required power. Actuating an inkjet device with 10 μm orifice diameter comfortably at 900 kHz and drying the droplets from 1 % salbutamol sulphate solution allowed the formation of particles with diameters of 1. 76 ± 0. 15 μm and the geometric standard deviation of 1. 08. In conclusion, optimising internal design of glass inkjet devices allowed the production of high‐throughput droplet ejectors. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association J Pharm Sci 103 : 3733 – 3742, 201...|$|E

40|$|Methods of {{producing}} non-sooting, low flame temperature diesel combustion were investigated in an optically-accessible, quiescent constant-volume combustion vessel under mixing-controlled diesel combustion conditions. Combustion and soot processes of single, isolated fuel jets were studied after auto-ignition and transient premixed combustion {{and while the}} injector was fully-open (i. e. during the mixing-controlled phase of heat release for diesel combustion). The investigation showed that small injector <b>tip</b> <b>orifices</b> {{could be used to}} produce non-sooting and low flame temperature combustion simultaneously. The use of small orifices was shown to enable non-sooting and low flame temperature combustion in two different ways as summarized below. A more detailed description of the experimental methods and results is provided in Ref. [1 - 3]. First, using an injector tip with a 50 micron orifice and ambient oxygen concentrations as low as 10 % (simulating the use of extensive EGR), a fuel jet was non-sooting at typical diesel ambient temperatures (1000 K). Second, using the same injector tip at a reduced ambient gas temperature (850 K), but with 21 % oxygen, it was shown that non-sooting, mixing-controlled combustion occurred at the lift-off length in a fuel-air mixture with a cross-sectional average equivalence ratio of approximately 0. 6 -suggesting that the quasi-steady combustion was fuel-lean and thereby avoided the formation of a diffusion flame. The adiabatic flame temperature with reduced ambient oxygen concentration or fuel-lean combustion was approximately 2000 K, compared to typical diesel flame temperatures that exceed 2600 K. The 50 micron orifice results above were obtained using a No. 2 diesel fuel. However, using an oxygenated fuel (20 wt% oxygen), the investigation showed that the same low temperature combustion, either with reduced ambient oxygen concentration or fuel-lean combustion, was realized with a 100 micron orifice. Although these single, isolated jets do not have jet-jet interactions that would occur in realistic engines, the results are useful for understanding limiting-case behavior of single-jet mixing and combustion during an injection event. The non-sooting and low flame temperature mixing-controlled combustion realized using small <b>orifice</b> <b>tips</b> suggests that the use of small orifices offers the potential for a simultaneous soot and NOx reduction in an engine, much like diesel HCCI combustion. However, {{further research is needed to}} determine whether these methods could be successfully implemented in real engines...|$|R

This problem was successfully solved by Nd:YAG laser membranotomy. Case Report: A 70 -year-old male, diagnosed with corticosteroid-induced glaucoma in his right eye, presented to our hospital. Topical betamethasone treatment was discontinued, and the patient was treated with intravenous D-mannitol and acetazolamide, followed by oral acetazolamide, oral potassium L-aspartate, topical dorzolamide hydrochloride, topical carteolol hydrochloride, and topical latanoprost. However, his right intraocular pressure (IOP) remained elevated. We performed ExPRESS shunt surgery in the patient's right eye. His postoperative IOP was initially within the normal range, but it reincreased 1 month after surgery.

Its location, size and shape are subject to alterations with {{the race of the}} population and limited information is available on developmental morphology and morphometry of fetal appendix. Materials and Methods: In the present study 60 appendix specimens from aborted human fetuses of 17 - 40 weeks gestational age and both sexes were studied by dissection method for age related morphological features and morphometric parameters. The morphological parameters observed include its location in relation to abdominal region, caecum and ileum, clock position, position of base in relation to caecal wall and direction of tip of appendix. The morphometric parameters of length, diameter and distance between ileo-caecal orifice and appendicular orifice were measured. Results: The location of appendix in relation to abdominal region presented higher incidence of sub-hepatic position in less than 30 weeks fetuses and right iliac fossa location in more than 30 weeks fetuses.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this atlas is to gather under one cover a series of photographic illustrations and line drawings that summarize major events during organogenesis in the opossum (Didelphis virginiana). The opossum is of interest because of its short gestation period (about 12. 5 days) {{and the fact that}} it is born in a near embryonic state. Because of the abbreviated period of intrauterine development, the opossum is an accessible biomedical model with which to study the major events that occur during organ development without the complications of doing intrauterine manipulations necessary if other mammalian species are used. The developing opossum can simply be examined and manipulated within the marsupium (pouch) during which time the majority of organogenesis takes place. The first nine days of gestation are concerned primarily with the establishment of the three germ layers. During this period of development, opossum blastocysts float freely within uterine secretions, each prevented from physically interacting with uterine tissues by a surrounding shell membrane. Initial organogenesis commences during the last three days of the 12. 5 day gestation period and continues well into the postnatal period. It is during the last three days of gestation, when the yolk sac placenta is intimately associated with the uterine mucosa that development proceeds at an astonishing rate to form functional structures that will allow for the survival of the newborn of this species. Those structures essential for survival at and immediately after birth develop precociously but follow a typical mammalian pattern of development. Such structures are generally modified in some way to allow for the survival of the young following the abbreviated gestation period. Following their migration to the pouch, the lateral angles of the newborn opossum mouth seal around the teat due to a proliferation of cells within the epitrichium. As a result the mouth is sealed shut with the exception of a narrow <b>orifice</b> at the <b>tip</b> of snout that permits the entrance of the nipple.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that patients with incomplete systolic mitral leaflet closure (IMLC: apically displaced coaptation) also have restricted diastolic leaflet opening that is independent of mitral inflow volume and provides evidence supporting increased leaflet tethering. Background. Competing hypotheses for functional mitral regurgitation (MR) with IMLC include global left ventricular (LV) dysfunction per se (reduced leaflet closing force) versus geometric distortion of the mitral apparatus by LV dilation (augmented leaflet tethering). These are inseparable in systole, but restricted leaflet motion has also been observed in diastole, and attributed to reduced mitral inflow. Methods. Diastolic mitral leaflet excursion and orifice area were measured by two-dimensional echocardiography in 58 patients with global LV dysfunction, 36 with and 22 without IMLC, compared with 21 normal subjects. The biplane Simpson’s method was used to calculate LV ejection volume, which equals mitral inflow volume {{in the absence of}} aortic regurgitation. Results. The diastolic mitral leaflet excursion angle was markedly reduced in patients with IMLC compared with those without IMLC, whose ventricles were smaller, and normal subjects (17 ± 10 ° vs. 58 ± 13 ° vs. 67 ± 8 °, p < 0. 0001). Excursion angle was dissociated from mitral inflow volume (r 2 = 0. 04); excursion was reduced in patients with IMLC despite a normal inflow volume in the larger ventricles with MR (60 ± 25 vs. 61 ± 12 ml in normal subjects, p = NS), and excursion was nearly normal in patients without IMLC despite reduced inflow volume (40 ± 10 ml, p < 0. 001 vs. normal subjects). The anterior leaflet when maximally open coincided well with the line connecting its attachments to the anterior annulus and papillary muscle tip (angular difference = 3 ± 7 ° vs. 25 ± 9 ° vs. 32 ± 10 ° in patients with and without IMLC vs. normal subjects, p < 0. 0001). In patients with IMLC, the leaflet <b>tip</b> <b>orifice</b> was smaller in an anteroposterior direction but wider than in the other groups, giving a normal total area (6. 8 ± 1. 8 vs. 7. 1 ± 1. 2 vs. 6. 9 ± 0. 8 cm 2, p = NS). Conclusions. Patients with LV dysfunction and systolic IMLC also have restricted diastolic leaflet excursion that is independent of inflow volume, coincides with the tethering line connecting the annulus and papillary muscle and reflects limitation of anterior motion relative to the posteriorly placed papillary muscles without a decrease in total orifice area. These observations are consistent with increased tethering by displaced mitral leaflet attachments in the dilated ventricles of patients with IMLC that can restrict both diastolic opening and systolic closure...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{experiments}} {{conducted in}} the Rotor Force Test Facility at the California Institute of Technology have {{examined the effects of}} a tip leakage restriction and swirl brakes on the rotordynamic forces due to leakage flows on an impeller undergoing a prescribed circular whirl. The experiments simulate the leakage flow conditions and geometry of the Alternate Turbopump Design (ATD) of the Space Shuttle High Pressure Oxygen Turbopump and are critical to evaluating the pump's rotordynamic instability problems. Previous experimental and analytical results have shown that discharge-to-suction leakage flows in the annulus of a shrouded centrifugal pump contribute substantially to the fluid induced rotordynamic forces. Also, previous experiments have shown that leakage inlet (pump discharge) swirl can increase the cross-coupled stiffness coefficient and hence increase the range of positive whirl for which the tangential force is destabilizing. In recent experimental work, the present authors demonstrated that when the swirl velocity within the leakage path is reduced by the introduction of ribs or swirl brakes, then a substantial decrease in both the destabilizing normal and tangential forces could be achieved. Motivation for the present research is that previous experiments have shown that restrictions such as wear rings or orifices at pump inlets affect the leakage forces. Recent pump designs such as the Space Shuttle Alternate Turbopump Design (ATD) utilize <b>tip</b> <b>orifices</b> at discharge for the purpose of establishing axial thrust balance. The ATD has experienced rotordynamic instability problems and one may surmise that these <b>tip</b> discharge <b>orifices</b> may also have an important effect on the normal and tangential forces in the plane of impeller rotation. The present study determines if such tip leakage restrictions contribute to undesirable rotordynamic forces. Additional motivation for the present study is that the widening of the leakage path annular clearance and the installation of swirl brakes in the ATD has been proposed to solve its instability problems. The present study assesses the effect of such a design modification on the rotordynamic forces. The experimental apparatus consists of a solid or dummy impeller, a housing instrumented for pressure measurements, a rotating dynamometer and an eccentric whirl mechanism. The solid impeller is used so that leakage flow contributions to the forces are measured, but the main throughflow contributions are not experienced. The inner surface of the housing has been modified to accommodate meridional ribs or swirl brakes within the leakage annulus. In addition, the housing has been modified to accommodate a discharge orifice that qualitatively simulates one side of the balance piston orifice of the Space Shuttle ATD. Results indicate the detrimental effects of a discharge orifice and the beneficial effects of brakes. Plots of the tangential and normal forces versus whirl ratio show a substantial increase in these forces along with destabilizing resonances at some positive whirl ratios when a discharge orifice is added. When brakes are added, some of the detrimental effects of the orifice are reduced. For the tangential force, a plot versus whirl ratio shows a significant reduction and a destabilizing resonance appears to be eliminated. For the normal force, although the overall force is not reduced, again a destabilizing resonance appears to be eliminated...|$|R
