5|$|In 1936, the {{previously}} dirt-covered yard was paved. The yard {{was part of}} the most violent escape attempt from Alcatraz in May 1946 when a group <b>of</b> <b>inmates</b> hatched a plot to obtain the key into the recreation yard, kill the tower guards, take hostages, and use them as shields to reach the dock.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{there was}} no system in place to allow prisoners to send letters; {{censorship}} arrangements were made through the Dominion Police in Ottawa, and the American Consul was designated a representative for prisoner welfare. As the war progressed, groups of detainees were transferred to and from other prisons according to their behaviour or level of risk and the number <b>of</b> <b>inmates</b> per institution. After the 1917 Halifax Explosion, prisoners were transferred to the 800-man Amherst Internment Camp at Amherst, Nova Scotia. One of the prisoners transferred may have been Leon Trotsky, although this is disputed.|$|E

5|$|Under Louis, {{only between}} 20 and 50 prisoners were usually {{held at the}} Bastille at any one time, {{although}} as many as 111 were held {{for a short period}} in 1703. These prisoners were mainly from the upper classes, and those who could afford to pay for additional luxuries lived in good conditions, wearing their own clothes, living in rooms decorated with tapestries and carpets or taking exercise around the castle garden and along the walls. By the late 17th century, there was a rather disorganised library for the use <b>of</b> <b>inmates</b> in the Bastille, although its origins remain unclear.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Yugoslavia's new {{communist}} government announced that Sajmište had held {{a total of}} 100,000 prisoners during the war, half of whom were killed. The Yugoslav State War Crimes Commission later estimated {{that as many as}} 40,000 may {{have been killed in the}} camp, including 7,000 Jews. According to the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, the overall death toll was greatly exaggerated by the communists for political purposes, and the real number <b>of</b> <b>inmates</b> was about 50,000, with 20,000 killed. It is estimated that half of all Serbian Jews were killed at Sajmište. The Staro Sajmište memorial estimates that 23,000 people perished in the camp, of whom 10,000 were Jews.|$|E
5|$|Despite a large {{expansion}} of the prison system, the problem of overcrowding remained throughout the 20th century, as did Western Australia's high incarceration rate relative {{to the rest of}} Australia. The nature of prisoners changed, with three times the proportion of 16- to 19-year-olds in 1984 compared to 1898, and a growing over-representation of Aboriginal prisoners to nearly half the incarcerated population. Sentences also increased in length, such that in 1984 more than 80% <b>of</b> <b>inmates</b> were serving more than a year. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was an increasing number of people committed for violent crimes, but still a minority of the population. Both staff and prisoners, however, perceived a notable increase in violence during these years, coinciding with the rise of illegal drugs in prison, and of sentences for drug-related offences.|$|E

5|$|In 1965, while {{a student}} at Bennington College, Dworkin was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest at the United States Mission to the United Nations {{and sent to the}} New York Women's House of Detention. Dworkin testified that the doctors in the House of Detention gave her an {{internal}} examination which was so rough that she bled for days afterwards. She spoke in public and testified before a grand jury about her experience, and the media coverage of her testimony made national and international news. The grand jury declined to make an indictment in the case, but Dworkin's testimony contributed to public outrage over the mistreatment <b>of</b> <b>inmates.</b> The prison was closed seven years later.|$|E
5|$|In May 1941 the VuWHA {{founded the}} Deutsche Ausrüstungswerke GmbH (German Equipment Works; DAW), {{which was created}} to {{integrate}} the SS business enterprises with the burgeoning concentration camp system. Himmler subsequently established four major new concentration camps in 1941: Auschwitz, Gross-Rosen, Natzweiler-Struthof, and Neuengamme. Each {{had at least one}} factory or quarry nearby where the inmates were forced to work. Himmler took a particular interest in providing laborers for IG Farben, which was constructing a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz III–Monowitz. The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945. Life expectancy <b>of</b> <b>inmates</b> at Monowitz averaged about three months. This was typical of the camps, as inmates were underfed and lived under disastrously bad living conditions. Their workload was intentionally made impossibly high, under the policy of extermination through labor.|$|E
5|$|Josef Mengele was {{a medical}} officer {{assigned}} to Auschwitz concentration camp from 1943 {{until the end}} of the war. As well as making most of the selections <b>of</b> <b>inmates</b> as they arrived by train from all over Europe, he performed unscientific and usually deadly experiments on the inmates. He left the camp in January 1945 as the Red Army approached and was briefly in American custody in Weiden in der Oberpfalz, but was released. He took work as a farm hand in rural Germany, remaining until 1949, when he decided to flee the country; he acquired a Red Cross passport and left for Argentina; he set up a business in Buenos Aires in 1951. Acting on information received from Wiesenthal, West German authorities tried to extradite Mengele in 1960, but he could not be found; he had in fact moved to Paraguay in 1958. He moved to Brazil in 1961 and lived there until his death in 1979.|$|E

5|$|The castle was {{captured}} by the rebels during the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549, and was garrisoned by the Royalists during the English Civil War in the 17th century. Towards {{the end of the}} civil war it was stripped for its building materials and rendered largely uninhabitable. A small gaol was erected in the centre of the bailey, which was also used for executions. The castle eventually became the county gaol for Cornwall, but was heavily criticised for its poor facilities and treatment <b>of</b> <b>inmates.</b> By 1842, the remaining prisoners had been moved to Bodmin Gaol and the site was closed, the castle being landscaped to form a park by the Duke of Northumberland. During the Second World War, the site was used to host United States Army soldiers and, later, by the Air Ministry for offices. The ministry left the castle in 1956 and the site was reopened to visitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} received {{money from}} the Crown to support the prisoners, with the amount varying on rank: the governor received 19 livres a day for each political prisoner – with conseiller-grade nobles receiving 15 livres – and, {{at the other end}} of the scale, three livres a day for each commoner. Even for the commoners, this sum was around twice the daily wage of a labourer and provided for an adequate diet, while the upper classes ate very well: even critics of the Bastille recounted many excellent meals, often taken with the governor himself. Prisoners who were being punished for misbehaviour, however, could have their diet restricted as a punishment. The medical treatment provided by the Bastille for prisoners was excellent by the standards of the 18th century; the prison also contained a number <b>of</b> <b>inmates</b> suffering from mental illnesses and took, by the standards of the day, a very progressive attitude to their care.|$|E
5|$|At first, the laborers {{walked the}} seven {{kilometers}} from Auschwitz I {{to the plant}} each day, but as this meant they had to rise at 03:00, many arrived exhausted and unable to work. The camp at Monowitz (also called Monowitz-Buna or Auschwitz III) was constructed and began housing inmates on 30 October 1942, the first concentration camp to be financed and built by private industry. In January 1943 the ArbeitsausbildungLager (labor education camp) was moved from the parent camp to Monowitz. These prisoners were also forced {{to work on the}} building site. The SS charged IG Farben three Reichsmarks per hour for unskilled workers, four for skilled workers. Although the camp administrators expected the prisoners to work at 75 percent of the capacity of a free worker, the inmates were only able to perform 20 to 50 percent as well. Site managers constantly threatened inmates with transportation to Birkenau for death in the gas chambers as a way to try to increase productivity. Deaths and transfers to the gas chambers at Birkenau reduced the prisoner population of Monowitz by nearly a fifth each month; numbers were made up with new arrivals. Life expectancy <b>of</b> <b>inmates</b> at Monowitz averaged about three months. Though the factory had been expected to begin production in 1943, shortages of labor and raw materials meant start-up had to be postponed repeatedly. The plant was almost ready to commence production when it was overrun by Soviet troops in 1945.|$|E

5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} {{out into the}} yard on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact <b>of</b> <b>inmates</b> overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, the only real opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E
