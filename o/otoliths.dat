5|$|Static {{balance is}} {{provided}} by two ventricles, the utricle and the saccule. Cells lining the walls of these ventricles contain fine filaments, and the cells are covered with a fine gelatinous layer. Each cell has 50–70 small filaments, and one large filament, the kinocilium. Within the gelatinous layer lie <b>otoliths,</b> tiny formations of calcium carbonate. When a person moves, these <b>otoliths</b> shift position. This shift alters {{the positions of the}} filaments, which opens ion channels within the cell membranes, creating depolarisation and an action potential that is transmitted to the brain along the vestibulocochlear nerve.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{compounds}} in fish <b>otoliths</b> {{are resistant to}} digestion, they {{are found in the}} digestive tracts and scats of piscivorous marine mammals, such as dolphins, seals, sea lions and walruses. Many fish can be identified to genus and species by their sagittal <b>otoliths.</b> <b>Otoliths</b> can therefore, to some extent, be used to reconstruct the prey composition of marine mammal diets.|$|E
25|$|Age can be {{determined}} by counting growth rings in fish scales, <b>otoliths,</b> cross-sections of fin spines for species with thick spines such as triggerfish, or teeth for a few species. Each method has its merits and drawbacks. Fish scales are easiest to obtain, but may be unreliable if scales have fallen off of the fish and new ones grown in their places. Fin spines may be unreliable for the same reason, and most fish do not have spines of sufficient thickness for clear rings to be visible. <b>Otoliths</b> will have stayed with the fish throughout its life history, but obtaining them requires killing the fish. Also, <b>otoliths</b> often require more preparation before ageing can occur.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} is {{presented}} a novel image processing tool for the extraction of geometric information in <b>otolith</b> images. It relies on the reconstruction of individual <b>otolith</b> shape histories from <b>otolith</b> images. Based on the proposed non-parametric level-set representation of <b>otolith</b> shape history, applications to the extraction of growth axes and ring structures in <b>otolith</b> images are first considered. A second category of applications concern the analysis of 2 D <b>otolith</b> growth. The potential of the proposed framework is illustrated on real <b>otolith</b> images for various species (e. g., cod, pollock) and discussed with a particular emphasis on the genericity of the approach and on applications such as <b>otolith</b> shape analysis, multi-proxy <b>otolith</b> analysis, <b>otolith</b> modeling...|$|R
40|$|In {{a survey}} on 524 {{specimens}} from 18 different species {{belonging to the}} Carangidae family collected from The Persian Gulf, otolithes (Sagittae) are extracted from under gills region. After washing, their morphometric parameters measured. These parameters are <b>otolith</b> length, width, weight and length of antirostrum, width and length of rostrum, width in right and left sagittae. In addition to the <b>otolith</b> outline, mode position and mode opening of the Sulcus acusticus was examined. Data indicate correlation between most of the parameters (P< 0. 05). This shows correlation between total length and weight of fish, <b>otolith</b> length and weight of <b>otolith</b> in most of specimens. There was correlation in most species between <b>otolith</b> length and total length of studies fishes, <b>otolith</b> weight and weight of fish, <b>otolith</b> weight and total length, <b>otolith</b> length and weight of fish, length of right and left <b>otolith.</b> <b>Otolith</b> had very diveres outline types (fusiform, sagitiform, lanceolated, iregular). There were most of variety about status dentates in dorsal margin and ventral margin of the <b>otolith.</b> As result of this analysis {{it is possible to}} identify species from the Carangidae family by the <b>otolith</b> characters...|$|R
40|$|<b>Otolith</b> {{compensation}} {{in animals}} has been amply demonstrated with the eccentric VOR study after selective <b>otolith</b> deafferentation. When the <b>otolith</b> system is damaged for experiment {{there is a}} deficiency of <b>otolith</b> compensation that demonstrates the essential role of commissural fibres from two otological sytems. In a human experimental model, working with dark linear movements along interneural axis, a complete OOR restoration after 6 - 10 weeks has been reported. The presence of concomitant <b>otolith</b> damage and monolateral canalar damage can condition a more persistant asymmetry of the VOR. The Spinal <b>Otolith</b> System has a relevant contribution to static and dynamic postural function. VEMPs, VEPPs, subjective visual vertical, static posturography, Head Heave Test (HHT) are better indicators of residual activity and functional restoration of <b>otolith</b> receptors after vestibular damage...|$|R
25|$|<b>Otoliths</b> {{cannot be}} used alone to {{reliably}} estimate cetacean or pinniped diets, however. They may suffer partial or complete erosion in the digestive tract, skewing measurements of prey number and biomass. Species with fragile, easily digested <b>otoliths</b> may be underestimated in the diet. To address these biases, otolith correction factors have been developed through captive feeding experiments, in which seals are fed fish of known size, {{and the degree of}} otolith erosion is quantified for different prey taxa.|$|E
25|$|Sagittal <b>otoliths</b> (sagittae) are bilaterally symmetrical, {{with each}} fish having one right and one left. Separating {{recovered}} <b>otoliths</b> into right and left, therefore, {{allows one to}} infer a minimum number of prey individuals ingested for a given fish species. Otolith size is also proportional to the length and weight of a fish. They can therefore be used to back-calculate prey size and biomass, useful when trying to estimate marine mammal prey consumption, and potential impacts on fish stocks.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that food amount {{influence}} fish <b>otolith</b> structure, opacity and shape and that diet composition has an effect on <b>otolith</b> chemical composition. This study investigated the potential correlation between diet and <b>otolith</b> shape in 5 wild marine fish species by addressing 4 complementary questions. First, is there a global relationship between diet and <b>otolith</b> shape? Second, which prey categories are involved in this relationship? Third, what are the respective contributions of food quantity and relative composition to diet–otolith shape co-variation? Fourth, is diet energetic composition related to <b>otolith</b> shape? For each species, we investigated how <b>otolith</b> shape varies with diet. These questions were tackled by describing diet in the analysis in 4 different ways, while also including individual-state variables to remove potential confounding effects. First, besides the strong effect of individual-state, a global relationship between diet and <b>otolith</b> shape was detected for 4 out of 5 fish species. Second, both main and secondary prey categories were related to variability in <b>otolith</b> shape. <b>Otolith</b> outline reconstructions revealed that both <b>otolith</b> global shape and its finer details co-varied with these prey categories. Third, the contribution of relative diet composition to diet–otolith shape co-variation was much higher than that of ingested food quantity. Fourth, the energetic composition of diet was related to <b>otolith</b> shape of only one species. These results suggest that diet in marine fish species may influence the quantity and composition of saccular endolymph proteins which {{play an important role in}} <b>otolith</b> biomineralization and their resulting 3 D structure...|$|R
40|$|Some {{time between}} 10 and 15 January 2009, a brown {{bullhead}} catfish(Ameiurus nebulosus) was found {{washed up on}} the shore of Okawa Bay, Lake Rotoiti. The elemental signature of the <b>otolith</b> was measured using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) {{in order to determine the}} origin of the catfish. The <b>otolith</b> elemental signature of the Rotoiti catfish was compared to the <b>otolith</b> elemental signatures of catfish caught at Tokaanu Bay, Lake Taupo. Because <b>otolith</b> chemistry is largely determined by water chemistry, fish sharing a common origin should show similar <b>otolith</b> elemental signature...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between <b>otolith</b> dimensions and fish size for six demersal and two pelagic species were examined {{and found to}} be both curvilinear and species-specific. <b>Otolith</b> morphometric observations included length for all species examined and weight, width, volume, cross-sectional area and location of the focal point for selected species. Regression models relating each <b>otolith</b> morphometric parameter to fish length are provided. Statistical tests to examine correlation between left and right <b>otolith</b> dimensions were carried out and, for redfish, correlation in <b>otolith</b> morphology between sexes was also analyzed. There appeared to be {{no statistically significant difference}} between left and right <b>otolith</b> or between sexes. The significance of each parameter for estimating fish length was examined and a multiple regression model determined. <b>Otolith</b> weight appeared to have the best discrimination for estimating fish length as well as the easiest parameter to measure...|$|R
25|$|Endolymphatic infillings such as <b>otoliths</b> are {{structures}} in the saccule and utricle of the inner ear, specifically in the vestibular labyrinth of all vertebrates (fish, amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds). In vertebrates, the saccule and utricle together make the otolith organs. Both statoconia and <b>otoliths</b> are used as gravity, balance, movement, and directional indicators in all vertebrates and have a secondary function in sound detection in higher aquatic and terrestrial vertebrates. They are sensitive to gravity and linear acceleration. Because of their orientation in the head, the utricle is sensitive {{to a change in}} horizontal movement, and the saccule gives information about vertical acceleration (such as when in an elevator).|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} and {{decomposition}} of a fish, <b>otoliths</b> may be preserved within the body of an organism or be dispersed before burial and fossilization. Dispersed <b>otoliths</b> {{are one of the}} many microfossils which can be found through a micropalaeontological analysis of a fine sediment. Their stratigraphic significance is minimal, but can still be used to characterize a level or interval. Fossil <b>otoliths</b> are rarely found in situ (on the remains of the animal), likely because they are not recognized separately from the surrounding rock matrix. In some cases, due to differences in colour, grain size, or a distinctive shape, they can be identified. These rare cases are of special significance, since the presence, composition, and morphology of the material can clarify the relationship of species and groups. In the case of primitive fish, various fossil material shows that endolymphatic infillings were similar in elemental composition to the rock matrix but were restricted to coarse grained material, which presumably is better for the detection of gravity, displacement, and sound. The presence of these extrinsic grains, in osteostracans, chondrichthyans, and acanthodians indicates a common inner ear physiology and presence of open endolymphatic ducts.|$|E
25|$|The {{inclusion}} of fish vertebrae, jaw bones, teeth, and other informative skeletal elements improves prey identification and quantification over otolith analysis alone. This {{is especially true}} for fish species with fragile <b>otoliths,</b> but other distinctive bones, such as Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), and Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus).|$|E
40|$|While {{temperature}} {{records are}} available from <b>otolith</b> δ 18 O profiles in fish, interpreting changes in <b>otolith</b> δ 13 C remains ambiguous. We compiled a global database of published <b>otolith</b> δ 13 C values for 60 species representing 30 families of marine fishes, Species' mean <b>otolith</b> δ 13 C ranged from + 0. 5 to - 8. 6 ‰. Among-family variance in <b>otolith</b> δ 13 C was uniquely explained by a morphometric index for aerobic swimming activity (caudal aspect ratio, r 2 = 0. 61). The models that consistently explained the maximum among-species variance in <b>otolith</b> δ 13 C included caudal aspect ratio and maximum depth of occurrence. Our analysis supports the use of <b>otolith</b> carbon-isotope ratios to indicate metabolism (primarily active) in marine fish.

40|$|Age {{determination}} {{of fish in}} a multi-species fishery from the <b>otolith</b> or other hard parts of fish is time consuming and expensive process. There are some relationships between <b>otolith</b> and fish age. In this study, <b>Otolith</b> length (O l), <b>Otolith</b> width (O wt), <b>Otolith</b> weight (O w), Fish length (L f) and Fish weight (W f) were used to estimate the age of Common pandora, Pagellus erythrinus (L., 1758), using the general linear regression model; Y= Xβ+ε. Among the model with one variable, the model with <b>Otolith</b> length (O l) variable was the best one, t = - 2. 101 + 0. 691 (O l) (R 2 = 0. 862).

40|$|Sagittal <b>otolith</b> morphometric {{measurements}} from Malaysian Mugilidae {{species were}} selected to investigate their possible role in species identification, due to the Mugilidae species’ morphological similarities, and age determination. Fish standard length (cm), <b>otolith</b> length (μm), width (μm) and mass (g) measurements were taken from eight species: Chelon macrolepis, C. melinopterus, C. subviridis, Ellochelon vaigiensis, Moolgarda cunnesius, M. seheli, Mugil cephalus and Valamugil engeli. <b>Otolith</b> aspect ratio, OAS (<b>otolith</b> length divided by width), was calculated and compared between species. The four homogenous groups based on their OAS were C. melinopterus (mean= 1. 65) and V. engeli (1. 66) and M. cunnesius (1. 89) and E. vaigiensis (1. 89); M. seheli (2. 08), C. macrolepis (2. 14) and M. cephalus (2. 17); and the latter two with C. subviridis (2. 43). The relationships between fish standard length and <b>otolith</b> length/mass showed positive correlations for both, with <b>otolith</b> length providing the stronger correlation (rs = 0. 897, P < 0. 001) than <b>otolith</b> mass (rs = 0. 795, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Curves {{describing}} the length–otolith size relationships for juveniles and adults of six fish species with widely differing biological characteristics were fitted simultaneously to fish length and <b>otolith</b> size at age, assuming that deviations from those curves are correlated rather than independent. The trajectories of the somatic and <b>otolith</b> growth curves throughout life, which reflect changing ratios of somatic to <b>otolith</b> growth rates, varied markedly among species {{and resulted in}} differing trends in the relationships formed between fish and <b>otolith</b> size. Correlations between deviations from predicted values were always positive. Dependence of length on <b>otolith</b> growth rate (i. e., “growth effect”) and “correlated errors in variables” introduce bias into parameter estimates obtained from regressions {{describing the}} allometric relationships between fish lengths and <b>otolith</b> sizes. The approach taken in this study to describe somatic and <b>otolith</b> growth accounted for both of these effects and that of age to produce more reliable determinations of the length–otolith size relationships used for back-calculation and assumed when drawing inferences from sclerochronological studies...|$|R

25|$|The {{function}} of the vestibular system during spaceflight {{is by far the}} most carefully studied of all. This is especially true of the gravity-sensing otolith organs and their relationship to eye movements. The vestibular semicircular canal function seems unchanged in weightlessness because the horizontal eye movements that compensated for head yaw rotation are not affected by spaceflight. The absence of gravity stimulation of the <b>otoliths</b> reduces the torsional vestibulo-ocular reflex during head roll rotation in microgravity. This deficit is absent when astronauts are exposed to centrifugal forces, suggesting that the adaptive CNS changes are taking place centrally rather than peripherally.|$|E

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2007 To {{determine}} the spawning area contributions of Pacific herring (Clupea pallashii) larvae to nursery bays, <b>otolith</b> chemical {{analysis was conducted}} on juvenile fish collected from 1995 to 1997 in Prince William Sound, Alaska. The <b>otolith</b> edge, representing the chemical signature of the known capture location, and the <b>otolith</b> core, representing the unknown spawning ground chemistry, were compared with discriminant function analysis to infer spawning area origin. Chemical signatures of ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr, ⁸⁸Sr/⁴⁸Ca, ²⁴Mg/⁴⁸Ca, and ¹³⁸Ba/⁴⁸Ca were used to identify broad spawning regions from inner and outer PWS that persisted for the three years sampling period despite significant interannual variability in <b>otolith</b> edge chemistry within nursery bays.

40|$|Electron {{microscope}} {{observations of}} the gravity receptor of the tadpole larva of Ciona intestinalis show that the <b>otolith</b> is unicellular. The nucleus of the <b>otolith</b> persists for the entire life of the tadpole. The pigment mass of the <b>otolith</b> is intracellular, and {{it appears to be}} built up by fusion of granules. The <b>otolith</b> cell has a free part within the cavity of the cerebral vesicle, and a foot part which is contained within a mound of cells on the ventral wall of the cerebral vesicle.
