5|$|Once {{out of the}} hospital, Johnny Sack's {{daughter}} gets {{married and}} the Soprano family attends. There, Tony is shown very exhausted when taking <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> through security. In the process, he collapses to the ground, but is not hurt. Before the wedding, Johnny Sack is approved to leave prison for six hours to see his daughter get married, but {{has to pay for}} the metal detectors and the presence of the U.S. marshals at the event. As his daughter is about to drive away, the SUV that was escorting Johnny to the wedding blocks the car from leaving and an altercation begins in the driveway. In a moment of weakness and despair, Johnny Sack cries as he is put back into handcuffs and driven back to prison, greatly diminishing the respect his crew and Tony's crew have for him.|$|E
25|$|He took a {{long trip}} to North China, {{beginning}} 2 April 1873 in Shanghai, arriving at Tianjin by boat, then travelling by mule cart and arriving in Peking on 16 April 1873, where he stayed at the London Missionary Society headquarters. He visited the Great Wall, Ming Tombs and the Temple of Heaven, where he felt compelled to take <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> with holy awe. He left Peking, accompanied by Joseph Edkins, and headed for Shandong by mule cart to visit Jinan, Taishan, where they ascended the sacred Mount Tai, carried by four men on chairs. Leaving Mount Tai on 15 May, they visited Confucius Temple and the Forest of Confucius at Qufu, where he {{climbed to the top}} of Confucius' burial mound. Legge returned to Shanghai by way of the Grand Canal, and thence to England via Japan and the USA in 1873.|$|E
500|$|Having {{crossed into}} France, they sought {{friendly}} troops. They decided {{to bypass the}} German positions by crossing the Maritime Alps, with a local guide, {{over the course of}} two days. They lacked equipment and clothing for mountaineering. During the night, Smith took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes,</b> and found in the morning that they had frozen and that he could not put them on. He continued in his socks, which wore through, forcing him to finish the journey walking barefoot on the ice and snow. After 23 days since Smith and Bill set off from Piancastagna, they met American troops who took them to a local base camp, from where they were returned to their respective forces. The Americans took Smith to Marseille, from where he was flown to the RAF transit camp at Naples. On arriving in late November 1944, Smith sent a brief telegram home to Selukwe: [...] "Alive and well. Love to you all—Ian." ...|$|E

500|$|There {{were several}} {{administrative}} difficulties during the tour. Bill Dowling—the {{chairman of the}} Australian Board of Control—had informed Loxton that no Test match was to begin until a receipt for 6,500 pounds had been handed over to Australian authorities. The Australian manager had also been told to rebuff any Pakistani overtures for a reciprocal tour, as it was feared that they lacked public appeal and would have caused financial losses due to a fall in ticket sales. Despite previous assurances to prepare turf pitches, the locals made a matting surface for the First Test. During the Second Test, when asked by General Ayub Khan—head of the ruling military junta—why Pakistan had not been invited to Australia, Loxton exploited the opportunity {{to complain about the}} wickets. When the tourists were greeted by another matting track in the Third Test, Ayub threatened to shoot the groundsmen if they prepared any more non-turf surfaces. The financial issue reared its head before the Second Test against India in Kanpur, when Loxton belligerently refused to start the match after the payment had failed to arrive on time. An Indian official asked the Australian manager to not [...] "spoil a beautiful friendship over money", to which the Australian manager replied [...] "Try me. I want it please...You know the rules." [...] The match proceeded after the cheque was delivered, and India inflicted Australia's only defeat for the tour and their first Test win over the visitors. Another mishap occurred during the Fifth Test at Eden Gardens in Calcutta; the Australians left their hotel and took to the field with ten men, having failed to notice that Ian Meckiff had overslept and been left behind by the team bus. During the First Test against Pakistan in Dacca, one of the umpires took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> {{and put them on the}} ground while play was in progress. Loxton took a photo of the scene and lodged it to cricket authorities, asking them to make a ruling on whether a batsman would be out if the ball struck the umpire’s loose shoes and bounced up into a fielder’s hands. However, he never received a reply.|$|E

Guiraud also states that [...] "as soon as Dominic passed the limits of towns and villages, he took <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes,</b> and, however sharp the stones or thorns, he trudged on his way barefooted", and that [...] "rain and other discomforts elicited from his lips nothing but praises to God".|$|E

2500|$|The {{ceremony}} {{of the formal}} admission of a Benedictine abbot in medieval times is thus prescribed by the consuetudinary of Abingdon. [...] The newly elected abbot was to put <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes</b> {{at the door of}} the church, and proceed barefoot to meet the members of the house advancing in a procession. [...] After proceeding up the nave, he was to kneel and pray at the topmost step of the entrance of the choir, into which he was to be introduced by the bishop or his commissary, and placed in his stall. [...] The monks, then kneeling, gave him the kiss of peace on the hand, and rising, on the mouth, the abbot holding his staff of office. [...] He then put on his shoes in the vestry, and a chapter was held, and the bishop or his delegate preached a suitable sermon.|$|E

Yousef removed a modified Casio digital watch from his wrist {{to be used as a}} timer, unpacked the remaining materials from his dopp kit, and assembled his bomb. [...] He set the timer for four hours later, which was approximately the time at which the plane would be far out over the ocean en route to Tokyo, put the entire bomb back into his dopp kit, and returned to his current seat.|$|E
2500|$|Eliade's {{understanding}} of religion centers on {{his concept of}} hierophany (manifestation of the Sacred)—a concept that includes, but is not limited to, the older and more restrictive concept of theophany (manifestation of a god). From the perspective of religious thought, Eliade argues, hierophanies give structure and orientation to the world, establishing a sacred order. The [...] "profane" [...] space of nonreligious experience can only be divided up geometrically: it has no [...] "qualitative differentiation and, hence, no orientation [...] given {{by virtue of its}} inherent structure". Thus, profane space gives man no pattern for his behavior. In contrast to profane space, the site of a hierophany has a sacred structure to which religious man conforms himself. A hierophany amounts to a [...] "revelation of an absolute reality, opposed to the non-reality of the vast surrounding expanse". As an example of [...] "sacred space" [...] demanding a certain response from man, Eliade gives the story of Moses halting before Yahweh's manifestation as a burning bush (Exodus 3:5) and taking <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes.</b>|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fourth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), in chapter [...] when Moses was keeping his {{father-in-law}} Jethro's flock at {{the mountain of}} God, Horeb (another name for the Biblical Mount Sinai), the angel of God appeared {{to him in a}} flame {{in the midst of a}} bush that burned but was not consumed. God called to Moses from the bush, and Moses answered: [...] "Here I am." [...] God told Moses not to draw near, and to take <b>off</b> <b>his</b> <b>shoes,</b> for the place on which he stood was holy ground. God identified as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, reported having seen the Israelites' affliction and heard their cry, and promised to deliver them from Egypt to Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey. God told Moses that God was sending Moses to Pharaoh to bring the Israelites out of Egypt, but Moses asked who he was that he should do so. God told Moses that God would be with him, and after he brought them out of Egypt, he would serve God on that mountain. Moses asked God whom he should say sent him to the Israelites, and God said [...] "I Will Be What I Will Be" [...] ( [...] , Ehyeh-Asher-Ehyeh), and told Moses to tell the Israelites that [...] "I Will Be" [...] ( [...] , Ehyeh) sent him. God told Moses to tell the Israelites that the Lord ( [...] , YHVH), the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, had sent him, and this would be God's Name forever.
