40|$|White-headed Duck <b>Oxyura</b> <b>leucocephala</b> is {{affected}} by environmental factors in a Mediterranean wetland. Zoological Studies 51 (6) : 783 - 792. The White-headed Duck <b>Oxyura</b> <b>leucocephala</b> is a globally endangered diving duck that breeds in a few wetlands in Spain, Asia, and northern Africa. Little is known about how environmental variables affect the duck’s distribution, so information is required to protect wintering and breeding areas. We attempted to assess which morphometric (open water surface and shoreline development index; [SDI]) and limnological variables (chironomid larvae biomass, macrophyte seed density, macrophyte cover, Secchi disk depth, conductivity, water depth, and chlorophyll a) were important in predicting suitable habitat conditions for this duck in an important wetland for the species in southeastern Spain. Our study included 2 periods with contrasting hydrological conditions: “wet ” (winter 2003 to summer 2004) and “dry” (spring to summer 2005). Limnological variables were measured, and bird censuses were performed once a month in each water body, while morphometric variables were estimated from aerial photographs. In the wet year, the probability {{of the presence of}} wintering ducks increased with a greater open water surface area. In spring, the likelihood of the species occurring increased with the SDI, biomass of chironomid larvae, and level of eutrophication, and decreased with an increasing open water surface area.

50|$|Ruddy ducks were {{imported}} into the UK in 1948 by conservationist Sir Peter Scott. As {{a result of}} escapes from wildfowl collections in the late 1950s, they became established in Great Britain, from where they spread into Europe. By the year 2000, the population had increased to around 6,000 individuals. This duck's aggressive courting behavior and willingness to interbreed with the endangered native white-headed duck (<b>Oxyura</b> <b>leucocephala),</b> of southern Europe, caused concern amongst Spanish conservationists. Due to this, a controversial scheme to extirpate the ruddy duck as a British breeding species started; {{there have also been}} culling attempts in other European countries. By early 2014, the cull had reduced the British population to about 20-100, down from a peak of about 5500 in 2000.|$|R
5000|$|The {{white-headed duck}} (<b>Oxyura</b> <b>leucocephala)</b> {{is a small}} stiff-tailed duck some 45 cm long. The male has a white head with black crown, a blue bill, and reddish-grey plumage. The female has a dark bill and rather duller colouring. Its {{breeding}} habitat is lakes with open water and dense vegetation at the margin. It dives under water and feeds on aquatic vegetation {{as well as some}} animal matter. It is more likely to swim away from a perceived threat than to fly. This duck is known from Spain, North Africa, western and central Asia. Populations are declining, mostly due to loss of habitat and hunting, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird's status as [...] "endangered".|$|R

40|$|The {{ruddy duck}} (Oxyura jamaicensis) was {{introduced}} to wildfowl collections in the United Kingdom (UK) in the 1940 s and subsequently escaped into the wild. Estimated numbers have increased rapidly in the UK from 20 wintering birds in 1962 to 5, 946 in January 2000. As the population of feral ruddy ducks in the UK rose, so did the number of records of ruddy ducks on the European mainland. In 1984, ruddy ducks were first recorded in Spain, which is home to internationally important populations of the rare indigenous white-headed duck (<b>Oxyura</b> <b>leucocephala).</b> By 1991, hybrids resulting from crosses between the two species were recorded in that country. The two species hybridize readily, with the ruddy duck apparently possessing the competitive advantage.

The fish-eating birds {{of the north}} of Iran belong to 41 species in 10 families which include 67. 2 percent of total fish eating bird species and 71 % of fish-eating bird’s family of Iran. Resident birds constitute 13 % of the fish-eating birds of the Caspian Sea coasts and the rest are migratory in autumn and winter. There exist 3 globally threatened species of fish-eating birds of {{the world at the}} north of Iran, which are <b>Oxyura</b> <b>leucocephala,</b> Phalacrocorax pygmeus, and Pelecanus crispus wintering in the south coast wetlands of the region.

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} the factors effecting nest-site choice of white-headed ducks (<b>Oxyura</b> <b>leucocephala)</b> at three wetlands (Lake Erçek, Lake Arin and Lake Norşin) in the Van Lake Basin, during 2007 - 2010. Selecting a nest site is an important decision in the annual cycle of ducks. This species preferred to breed in the habitats having tall and dense reeds (Phragmites spp.) and cattails (Typha spp.), far from the shore and human effects which are sheltered from wind and precipitation. It was observed that 19 old nests of coots (Fulica atra) were repaired by male and female ducks throughout the study period. The most important factors found in the nest site selection by white-headed duck were reed height, elevation of nest from water, distance from shore and open lake. Nest preference was 51 % affected by reed height, 48 % by elevation from water, 55 % by distance from shore and 42 % by distance from open lake. Norşin Lake, where breeding success of white-headed duck was greatest, was determined as most favourable nesting site in Van Lake Basin {{because of the fact}} that nests were far away from human activity. Such informations can be effectively used for the management and conservation of white-headed duck and other waterfowls breeding in the are...|$|R

The numbers in brackets refer {{to the number of}} records (first number) and individuals (second number), recorded between 1 Jan 1950 and 31 Dec 2012. Since 1 Jan 2013, submission to the Committee is required for 37 additional species, 17 of which are regional rarities. Records of these species are not numbered, since records from previous years were not collected by the Committee. Four new species were recorded in category A: White-headed Duck <b>Oxyura</b> <b>leucocephala,</b> Baillon’s Crake Porzana pusilla, Audouin’s Gull Larus audouinii and Siberian Rubythroat Calliope calliope. Three species, Helmeted Guineafowl Numida meleagris, Chukar Alectoris chukar and Common Bulbul Pycnonotus barbatus, were added to category E.

40|$|The Burdur Lake basin in Turkey’s Mediterranean {{region has}} been facing severe {{environmental}} {{damage in the}} form of increased pollution and a decrease in water volume, despite its Ramsar status as a major wintering site for the endangered white-headed duck (<b>Oxyura</b> <b>leucocephala).</b> In fact, after the basin was granted Ramsar status it was made the subject of a ‘hard-park’ conservation policy. This in practice disenfranchised and alienated local people but did not lead to the effective preservation of the basin. We aim to shed light on the political ecology of the ongoing degradation, which has layers at local, national, and international levels, by using both quantitative and qualitative methods (consisting of in-depth interviews, focus groups, and face-to-face, randomly selected interviews with 625 people). We specifically explore the possible reasons why local people by and large did not—despite their high level of environmental concern about the site—demand conservation policies or voluntarily take action to preserve their site. Acknowledging that the sources of the problem are multilayered in nature, thus requiring a multilevel solution, we then propose a governance modality tailored for the case at hand. Since many of the problems that Burdur Lake faces are not unique, it is hoped that the conducted analysis will be relevant to other similar sites. ...|$|R
40|$|Native to North America, ruddy ducks Oxyura jamaicensis now {{occur in}} 21 {{countries}} in the western Palaearctic (including Iceland) and their expanding population threatens the native white-headed duck, <b>Oxyura</b> <b>leucocephala,</b> through hybridization and possibly competition for food and nest sites. We used mitochondrial DNA sequences and nuclear microsatellites to test whether the European ruddy duck population is descended solely from the captive population in the UK, which traces to seven individuals imported from the USA in 1948, or, alternatively, has been augmented by natural dispersal of birds from North America. Limited genetic diversity in the European population {{is consistent with a}} founder population as small as seven birds. In addition, shifts in allele frequencies at several loci, presumably due to genetic drift in the founding population, result in significant differentiation between the European and North American populations. Despite the recent separation of these populations, almost all individuals could be unambiguously assigned based on their composite genotypes, to one of two distinct populations, one comprising all of the European ruddy ducks we sampled (including those from Iceland and captive birds in the UK) and the other comprising all North American samples. Our results confirm that the European ruddy duck population is likely to derive solely from the captive population in the UK and we find no evidence of recent arrivals from North America or of admixture between ruddy ducks from Europe and North America.

40|$|Realistic {{population}} size estimates for waterbirds are {{crucial for the}} application of wetland conservation strategies, since the identification of internationally important wetlands is based on local numbers relative to the {{population size}} of the respective species. Central Asia is a poorly surveyed region that is situated at the intersection of migration routes that lead waterbirds from Western Siberia to the south-west (South-West Asia, East Africa) and to the south-east (South Asia, India). We calculated waterbird population estimates for the Tengiz-Korgalzhyn region, a large wetland complex in the steppe zone of Central Kazakhstan, based on waterbird surveys conducted between 1999 and 2004. For 20 of 43 species analysed the region supported more than 5 % of the relevant flyway populations. Five species occurred with more than 40 % of the flyway totals, including the Endangered White-headed Duck <b>Oxyura</b> <b>leucocephala</b> and the Vulnerable Dalmatian Pelican Pelecanus crispus. Peak numbers were recorded in summer and autumn and for most species numbers were more than an order of magnitude lower on spring migration compared with autumn migration. We identified 72 individual sites that held more than 20, 000 waterbirds or more than 1 % of a particular flyway population at least once. These sites are likely to constitute priorities for conservation. The general conservation status of the region is favourable, since many of the important sites are located within a strict nature reserve. However, outside the reserve hunting, fishing and powerline casualties represent conservation issues that should be monitored more carefully in the future...|$|R
40|$|Avian {{botulism}} kills {{thousands of}} waterbirds every year, including endangered species, but {{information about the}} differences between species in vulnerability to botulism outbreaks and the capacity to act as carriers of Clostridium botulinum is still poorly known. Here, we estimated the vulnerability to botulism of 11 waterbird species from Mediterranean wetlands by comparing the number of affected birds with the census of individuals at risk. The capacity of different species to act as carriers was studied by detecting the presence of the C. botulinum type C/D botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) gene in fecal samples and prey items of waterbirds in the wild and by the serial sampling of cloacal swabs of birds affected by botulism. We found differences among species in their vulnerabilities to botulism, probably related to feeding habits, season of arrival, turnover, and, possibly, phylogenetic resilience. The globally endangered white-headed duck (<b>Oxyura</b> <b>leucocephala)</b> showed mortality rates in the studied outbreaks of 7 % and 17 % of the maximum census, which highlights botulism as a risk factor for the conservation of the species. Invasive water snails, such as Physa acuta, may be important drivers in botulism epidemiology, because 30 % of samples tested positive for the BoNT gene during outbreaks. Finally, our results show that birds may excrete the pathogen for up to 7 days, and some individuals can do it for longer periods. Rails and ducks excreted C. botulinum more often and for longer times than gulls, which could be related to their digestive physiology (i. e., cecum development).

40|$|The White-headed Duck <b>Oxyura</b> <b>leucocephala</b> {{is listed}} as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Animals. It is also listed on Annex I of the European Union Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (79 / 409 /EEC) (Birds Directive), on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Bern Convention), on Appendix I of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (Bonn Convention), and Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES Convention). The White-headed Duck is a highly aquatic diving duck of the stifftail tribe Oxyurini. Globally, there are four populations; {{two of which are}} declining, one stable and one increasing. The {{decreasing}} populations include the main Central Asian population of 5, 000 - 10, 000 birds and the Pakistan wintering population, which {{is on the verge of}} extinction. The resident North African population (400 - 600 birds) is stable and the Spanish population (ca. 2, 500 birds) increasing. The White-headed Duck occurs regularly in 26 countries, and in another 22 as a vagrant. Nine countries hold significant breeding numbers (Algeria, Islamic Republic of Iran, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Russian Federation, Spain, Tunisia, Turkey, and Uzbekistan), but most are concentrated in Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, and Spain. Birds occur commonly on migration in 10 countries, and in winter (December to February) in 13. The most important wintering countries differ from year-to-year, presumably depending on weather conditions. In recent years, 10 countries have held over 1, 000 birds (Azerbaijan, Bulgaria, Greece, Islamic Republic of Iran, Israel, Kazakhstan, Russian Federation, Spain, Turkey, and Uzbekistan – see Table 2).

40|$|Mediterranean shallow lakes support high {{biodiversity}} but suffer many anthropogenic threats, including {{introductions of}} alien fish. We studied {{the impact of}} introduction of common carp (Cyprinus carpio) to Medina and Zoñar lakes in SW Spain. Both lakes were protected as Ramsar sites because of their importance for waterbirds, particularly the globally threatened white-headed duck (<b>Oxyura</b> <b>leucocephala</b> IUCN Endangered) and common pochard (Aythya ferina IUCN Vulnerable). Two carp introduction events in Medina lake, with total eradication of carp in between, provided {{a unique opportunity to}} study the impacts of carp on the waterbird community (counted monthly from 2001 to 2013, with up to 69 species) and submerged macrophyte cover (quantified with satellite images). A comparison of waterbird abundance before and after carp eradication in the smaller Zoñar lake supported the results from Medina lake. Carp consistently led to the destruction of macrophyte beds and a radical change in the waterbird community. After controlling for the influence of depth fluctuations, the numbers and species richness of diving ducks were significantly reduced by carp, whilst the opposite effect was observed for piscivores such as herons. Negative impacts on O. leucocephala, A. ferina, red-crested pochard (Netta rufina) and herbivorous coots (Fulica spp.) were particularly pronounced. A significant negative impact of carp was also recorded on greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus ruber), black-necked grebes (Podiceps nigricollis), little grebes (Tachybaptus ruficollis) and gadwall (Anas strepera). In contrast, carp presence had a positive impact on grey herons (Ardea cinerea). The ongoing expansion of alien cyprinids in the Mediterranean region constitutes a major threat for waterbirds and particularly for sedentary, threatened taxa such as the white-headed duck and red-knobbed coot (F. cristata). Of 22 key sites for the isolated Iberian population of white-headed duck identified in a European action plan in 1996, at least 14 have since suffered carp invasions. Further development of successful control methods for carp populations is urgently required to support the conservation of waterbirds in the Mediterranean region. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
