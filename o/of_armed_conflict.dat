5|$|The use {{of horses}} in World War I marked a {{transitional}} {{period in the}} evolution <b>of</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict.</b> Cavalry units were initially considered essential offensive elements of a military force, but {{over the course of}} the war, the vulnerability of horses to modern machine gun and artillery fire reduced their utility on the battlefield. This paralleled the development of tanks, which would ultimately replace cavalry in shock tactics. While the perceived value of the horse in war changed dramatically, horses still played a significant role throughout the war.|$|E

40|$|The high {{incidence}} <b>of</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> in biodiverse regions poses significant challenges in achieving international conservation targets. Because attitudes towards risk vary, we assessed different strategies for protected area planning that reflected alternative attitudes towards the risk <b>of</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> We find that ignoring conflict risk will deliver the lowest return on investment. Opting to completely avoid conflict-prone areas offers limited improvements and {{could lead to}} species receiving no protection. Accounting for conflict by protecting additional areas to offset the impacts <b>of</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> would not only increase the return on investment (an effect that is enhanced when high-risk areas are excluded) but also increase upfront conservation costs. Our results also demonstrate that fine-scale estimations of conflict risk could enhance the cost-effectiveness of investments. We conclude that achieving biodiversity targets in volatile regions will require greater initial investment and benefit from fine-resolution estimates of conflict risk...|$|R

40|$|While we {{know why}} rebels may recruit {{children}} for their cause, {{our understanding of the}} consequences of child soldiering by non-state armed groups remains limited. The following research contributes to addressing this by examining how rebels? child recruitment practice affects the duration <b>of</b> internal <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts.</b> We advance the argument that child soldiering increases the strength of rebel organizations vis-�-vis the government. This, in turn, lowers the capability asymmetry between these nonstate actors and the incumbent, allowing the former to sustain in dispute. Ultimately, the duration <b>of</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts</b> is likely to be prolonged. We analyze this relationship with quantitative data on child soldier recruitment by rebel groups in the post- 1989 period. The results confirm our main hypothesis: disputes are substantially longer when rebels recruit children. This work has important implications for the study <b>of</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflicts,</b> conflict duration, and our understanding of child soldiering...|$|R

25|$|International Humanitarian Law (IHL), Treaties and Customary Law International Humanitarian Law {{is a set}} {{of rules}} that come into effect in armed conflicts. It aims to {{minimize}} the harms of an armed conflict by imposing obligations and duties to those who participate in armed conflicts. IHL mainly deals with two parts, the protection of persons who are not, or no longer taking part in fighting and restrictions on the means and methods of warfare such as weapons and tactics. IHL is founded upon Geneva conventions which were first signed in 1864 by 16 countries. Traditions and Customs had governed the conduct of war until then, which varied depending on the location and time. The First Geneva Convention of 1949 covers the protection for the wounded and sick <b>of</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> on land. The Second Geneva Convention asks for the protection and care for the wounded, sick and shipwrecked <b>of</b> <b>armed</b> <b>conflict</b> at sea. The Third Geneva Convention emphasizes the treatment of prisoners of war. The Fourth Geneva Convention concerns the protection of civilians in time of war. In addition, there are many more body of Customary International Laws (CIL) that come into effect when necessary.|$|E
