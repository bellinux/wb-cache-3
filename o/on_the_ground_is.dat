5|$|Based {{on current}} fossil {{evidence}} from dinosaurs such as Oryctodromeus, some ornithischian species {{seem to have}} led a partially fossorial (burrowing) lifestyle. Many modern birds are arboreal (tree climbing), and this was also true of many Mesozoic birds, especially the enantiornithines. While some early bird-like species may have already been arboreal as well (including dromaeosaurids such as Microraptor) most non-avialan dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of biomechanics, pioneered by Robert McNeill Alexander, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run, whether diplodocids could create sonic booms via whip-like tail snapping, and whether sauropods could float.|$|E
5|$|Flight 1 {{crashed into}} Pumpkin Patch Channel, Jamaica Bay, at 10:08:49, while angled at 78 degrees {{and on a}} {{magnetic}} heading of 300 degrees. Passengers aboard a Mohawk Airlines plane bound for Albany that took off immediately after Flight 1 watched the plane plunge into the bay. The jet exploded upon impact, a geyser of brackish water and black smoke erupted from the site, and the scattered debris and fuel caught fire. Long Island residents described hearing explosions which shook the foundations of nearby houses, though no one <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> known to have witnessed the plane hitting the swamp. However, a few men at Naval Air Station New York / Floyd Bennett Field saw the massive geyser of water rising above the hangars, and one guard—at his post on a bridge that the plane flew over—saw the plane roll over.|$|E
5|$|Aerial predators of the Atlantic puffin {{include the}} {{great black-backed gull}} (Larus marinus), the great skua (Stercorarius skua), and similar-sized species, which can catch a bird in flight, or attack one that is unable to escape fast enough on the ground. On {{detecting}} danger, puffins take off and fly down {{to the safety of}} the sea or retreat into their burrows, but if caught they defend themselves vigorously with beak and sharp claws. When the puffins are wheeling round beside the cliffs it becomes very difficult for a predator to concentrate on a single bird while any individual isolated <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> at greater risk. Smaller gull species like the herring gull (L. argentatus) and the lesser black-backed gull are hardly able to bring down a healthy adult puffin. They stride through the colony taking any eggs that have rolled towards burrow entrances or recently hatched chicks that have ventured too far towards the daylight. They will also steal fish from puffins returning to feed their young. Where it nests on the tundra in the far north, the Arctic skua (Stercorarius parasiticus) is a terrestrial predator, but at lower latitudes it is a specialised kleptoparasite, concentrating on auks and other seabirds. It harasses puffins while they are airborne forcing them to drop their catch which it then snatches up.|$|E

25|$|Their nests may {{be located}} in the trees or on the ground. Ground nests, {{frequently}} located near leaf litter, may be fabricated within sunken areas of the soil or beneath logs. Ground nests have both advantages and disadvantages. Floods or wet soil may force golden mice to leave their ground nests and relocate into the trees. However, if the ground nest is undisturbed, it can lower the risk for predation for the following reasons: the nest is well hidden, a mouse <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> more likely to escape a predator, and less energy is required to build a nest on the ground since the mouse doesn't have to keep running up and down a tree with nesting materials.|$|E

25|$|Neumarkt am Wallersee. Laid out as {{a planned}} town for Archbishop Eberhard II of Salzburg around 1240 and {{referred}} to as ‘Novum Forum’. It was a strategically important position on the NW boundary of Archdiocese and initially {{appears to have been}} commercially successful, but the Medieval layout {{does not appear to have}} survived, In 1638 the Salzburg Cathedral architect Santino Solari was commissioned to either fortify or re-fortify the site by the Archbishop Paris Graf von Lodron. The surviving evidence <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> slight. There seem to be two or three pointed Italian trace bastions to the N of the Church and another to the S. It might be some form of Star fort, but quite possibly the fortifications were never completed.|$|E
25|$|However, since 2001 {{the civil}} society in the three {{southern}} Thai provinces has experienced a widespread imposition of legalistic Salafi norms and the reality <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> today {{very different from what}} it was in former southern Thailand. Salafism has heavily eroded Patani cultural identity and current insurgent groups have extreme religious goals, such as an Islamic Caliphate, to the detriment of Patani nationalism. Although some of the present-day insurgents are very likely former PULO members, it is still unclear whether they fight for PULO's cause and it is likely that many may have become part of the more active and religious organisations that have overtaken PULO. In recent years PULO's leadership has largely lost control over its insurgents and has a very limited overall degree of influence over the insurgency in southern Thailand.|$|E

500|$|Like Salafists, Tabligh seek a [...] "separation {{in their}} daily life from the `impious` society that {{surrounded}} them". The only objective of Tabligh Jamaat, overtly stated in most sermons, is that Muslims adopt and invite for the Islamic lifestyle, exemplified by Muhammad, in its perfection. This involves a detailed orthopraxy: [...] "followers must dress like the Prophet, sleep as he did on the ground, on one's right side"; enter bathrooms leading with the left foot, but put pants on leading with the right foot; do not use a fork when eating, instead use your index finger, middle finger and thumb; men shave their upper lips, but let their beards grow; their pants or robes should be above the ankle [...] "because the prophet said letting clothes drag <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> a sign of arrogance".|$|E

500|$|Adult coconut crabs feed on fruits, nuts, seeds, and the pith {{of fallen}} trees, but will eat carrion and other organic matter opportunistically. Anything left {{unattended}} <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> a {{potential source of}} food which they will investigate and may carry away - thereby getting the alternative name of [...] "Robber crab." [...] The species is popularly associated with the coconut palm, yet coconuts are not {{a significant part of}} its diet. Although it lives in a burrow the crab has been filmed climbing coconut and pandanus trees. There is no film showing a crab selectively picking coconut fruit, though they might dislodge ripe fruit that otherwise would fall naturally. [...] Climbing is an immediate escape route (if too far from the burrow) to avoid predation (when young) by large sea birds, or cannibalism (at any age) by bigger, older crabs.|$|E
500|$|Tomb Raider: Underworld is {{a single}} player, action-adventure video game. The game is {{presented}} in third person perspective, where the player takes control of Lara Croft. Lara's environment reproduces a more [...] "interactive world that reacts and remembers", such that footprints left in the mud or mud transferred to Lara's knee from kneeling <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> washed away by rain, {{the bodies of the}} foes she encounters remain where she killed them, and any destruction to the environment she causes is permanent. According to creative director Eric Lindstrom, this is [...] "to not only reward the player for the effect they're having on the world, but to give them navigational aids." [...] The game uses an animation blending system that allows Lara to interact dynamically with her environment, such as pushing foliage aside with one or two hands, depending on if she is carrying a weapon. It also features a [...] "hybrid lighting model that combines dynamic lights with carefully created light maps" [...] and a weather system that changes the environment, for example, [...] "If Lara’s negotiating a wet ledge she’s more apt to slip or lose grip," [...] which makes [...] "the environment [...] her adversary" [...] for {{a large part of the}} game.|$|E
500|$|The Word for World is Forest begins {{from the}} point of view of Captain Davidson, who is the {{commander}} of a logging camp named Smith camp. Many native Athsheans are used as slave labor at the camp, and also as personal servants. The novel begins with Davidson travelling to [...] "Centralville", the headquarters of the colony, hoping to have a sexual encounter with one of a number of women who have just arrived on the predominantly male colony. When Davidson returns to Smith Camp, he finds the entire camp burned to the ground, and all of the humans dead. He lands to investigate, and while <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>is</b> overpowered by four Athsheans. He recognizes one of them as Selver, an Athshean who was a personal servant at the headquarters of the colony, and later an assistant to Raj Lyubov, the colony anthropologist. A few months prior to the attack, Davidson had raped Selver's wife Thele, who died in the process, prompting an enraged Selver to attack Davidson. Davidson nearly kills him, before he is rescued by Lyubov; however, he is left with prominent facial scars, which render him easily recognizable. The Athsheans allow Davidson to leave and carry a message about the destruction of the camp back to the colony headquarters.|$|E
