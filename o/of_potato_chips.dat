40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to study storage duration <b>of</b> <b>potato,</b> temperature and drying duration on the quality <b>of</b> Granola <b>potato</b> <b>chips.</b> This research was conducted at Postharvest Laboratory of Indonesian Vegetable Research Institute from May to November 2009. A Randomized Complete Block Design was used with two replications. First factor was storage duration of potato: 1 day, 4 and 7 days. Second factor was temperature: 40 °C, 50 °C and 60 °C.

2500|$|An {{additional}} variant <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> <b>chips</b> {{exists in}} the form of [...] "potato sticks", also called shoestring potatoes. These are made as extremely thin (2 to 3mm) versions of the popular French fry but are fried in the manner of regular salted potato chips. A hickory-smoke-flavored version is popular in Canada, going by the vending machine name [...] "Hickory Sticks". Potato sticks are typically packaged in rigid containers, although some manufacturers use flexible pouches, similar to potato chip bags. Potato sticks were originally packed in hermetically sealed steel cans. In the 1960s, manufacturers switched to the less expensive composite canister (similar to the Pringles container). Reckitt Benckiser was a market leader in this category under the Durkee Potato Stix and French's Potato Sticks names but exited the business in 2008. In 2014, French's reentered the market.|$|E
2500|$|However, {{a legend}} {{associates}} the creation <b>of</b> <b>potato</b> <b>chips</b> with Saratoga Springs, New York, decades later. By {{the late nineteenth}} century, a popular {{version of the story}} attributed the dish to George Crum, a half-black, half-Native American cook at Moon's Lake House, who was trying to appease an unhappy customer on 24 August 1853. The customer kept sending his French-fried potatoes back, complaining that they were too thick, too [...] "soggy," [...] and/or not salted well enough. Frustrated, Crum personally sliced several potatoes extremely thin, fried the potato slices to a crisp, and seasoned them with extra salt. To Crum's surprise, the customer loved them. They soon came to be called [...] "Saratoga Chips," [...] a name that persisted into at least the mid-twentieth century. A version of this story popularized in a 1973 national advertising campaign by St. Regis Paper Company, which manufactured packaging for chips, said that Crum's customer was Cornelius Vanderbilt. Crum was already renowned as a chef at the time, and by 1860, he owned his own lakeside restaurant, which he called Crum's House.|$|E

So turn off the TV set, put the video game away. Buy a little desk or put that child by the kitchen table. Watch them do their homework. If they don't know how to do it, give them help.
