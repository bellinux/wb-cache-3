50|$|Historically, Boomerang avoided <b>overt</b> <b>channel</b> drift and, despite adding newer {{content to}} its library, {{continued}} to air programming from {{the breadth of}} its archives. As of spring 2014, however, most of its archival programming has been relegated to graveyard slots while the daytime schedule has increasingly been dominated by programming from the 1990s and later. Tom and Jerry, Looney Tunes, Scooby-Doo, and The Garfield Show have permanent places on the schedule as of August 2015; a few shows, such as The Flintstones, Pokémon, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, Courage the Cowardly Dog, Chowder, and The Smurfs are usually on the schedule but are periodically taken off the schedule for brief periods, or have their slots on the schedule shuffled around. Most other programs aired by Boomerang stay on the schedule for several weeks, then are rotated out and replaced by other programs.|$|E
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{covert channel}} is to prove the {{feasibility}} of using encrypted HTTPS trafﬁc to carry a covert channel. The encryption key is not needed because the original HTTPS payload is not decrypted. The covert message will be appended to the HTTPS data ﬁeld. The receiver will extract the covert channel and restore the original HTTPS trafﬁc for forwarding. Only legitimate HTTPS connections {{will be used as}} the <b>overt</b> <b>channel.</b> A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack at the sending and receiving ends will give access to modify the trafﬁc streams. The HTTPS return trafﬁc from the server can carry a covert channel. Without the original HTTPS trafﬁc for comparison or the original encryption keys, this covert channel is undetectable...|$|E
40|$|The Crimean {{operation}} {{has served as}} an occasion for Russia to demonstrate to the entire world the capabilities and the potential of information warfare. Its goal is to use difficult to detect methods to subordinate the elites and societies in other countries by making use of various kinds of secret and <b>overt</b> <b>channels</b> (secret services, diplomacy and the media), psychological impact, and ideological and political sabotage. Russian politicians and journalists have argued that information battles are necessary for “the Russian/Eurasian civilisation” to counteract “informational aggression from the Atlantic civilisation led by the USA”. This argument from the arsenal of applied geopolitics {{has been used for}} years. This text is an attempt to provide an interpretation of information warfare with the background of Russian geopolitical theory and practice...|$|R
40|$|Communication is not {{necessarily}} made se- cure {{by the use of}} encryption alone. The mere existence of communication is often enough to raise suspicion and trigger investigative actions. Covert channels aim to hide the very existence of the communication. The huge amount of data and vast number of different protocols in the Internet makes it ideal as a high-bandwidth vehicle for covert communications. Covert channels are hidden inside pre-existing overt communication by encoding additional semantics onto ‘normal’ behaviours of the <b>overt</b> <b>channels.</b> We have developed CCHEF – a flexible and extensible software framework for evaluating covert channels in network protocols. The framework is able to establish covert channels across real networks using real overt traffic, but can also emulate covert <b>channels</b> based on <b>overt</b> traffic previously collected in trace files. In this paper we present the design and implementation of CCHEF...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Issues of {{security}} and privacy in surveillance systems are abound. Much focus has been put toward developing security strategies for emerging wireless visual sensor networks. Solutions target protection of the <b>overt</b> communication <b>channel.</b> However, given the characteristics of these networks which include shared resources, high degrees of collaboration {{and the presence of}} redundancy and uncertainty, they represent a rich environment for the presence of covert communications. Thus, we assert that threat models for such systems must include steganographic models. In this paper, we present the problem of preventative steganalysis that addresses steganographic issues in wireless visual sensor networks. The goal of preventative steganalysis is to offer a proactive solution against steganography by increasing the steganalyst’s knowledge of the cover-media and thus emphasizing the presence of hidden messages. This paper introduces the topic of preventative steganalysis. Characteristics of an effective steganographic solution are derived and a practical solution is tested...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Covert timing {{channels}} aim at transmitting hidden messages {{by controlling}} {{the time between}} transmissions of consecutive payload packets in overt network communication. Previous results used encoding mechanisms that are either easy to detect with statistical analysis, thus spoiling {{the purpose of a}} covert channel, and/or are highly sensitive to channel noise, rendering them useless in practice. In this paper, we introduce a novel covert timing channel which allows to balance undetectability and robustness: i) the encoded message is modulated in the inter-packet delay of the underlying <b>overt</b> communication <b>channel</b> such that the statistical properties of regular traffic can be closely approximated and ii) the underlying encoding employs spreading techniques to provide robustness. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of our approach by establishing covert channels over online gaming traffic. The experimental results show that our covert timing channel can achieve strong robustness and undetectability, by varying the data transmission rate. ...|$|R
40|$|Steganography is {{a useful}} tool that allows covert {{transmission}} of information over an <b>overt</b> communications <b>channel.</b> Combining covert channel exploitation with the encryption methods of substitution ciphers and/or one time pad cryptography, steganography enables the user to transmit information masked inside of a file in plain view. The hidden data is both difficult to detect and when combined with known encryption algorithms, equally difficult to decipher. This paper provides a general overview of the following subject areas: historical cases and examples using steganography, how steganography works, what steganography software is commercially available and what data types are supported, what methods and automated tools are available to aide computer forensic investigators and information security professionals in detecting the use of steganography, after detection has occurred, can the embedded message be reliably extracted, can the embedded data {{be separated from the}} carrier revealing the original file, and finally, what are some methods to defeat the use of steganography even if it cannot be reliably detected...|$|R
40|$|Protecting {{sensitive}} data {{is no longer}} a problem restricted to governments whose national security is at stake. With ubiquitous Internet connectivity, it is challenging to secure a network – not only to prevent attack, but also to ensure that {{sensitive data}} are not released. In this paper, we consider the problem of ensuring that only pre-authorized data leave a network boundary using either <b>overt</b> or covert <b>channels,</b> i. e., preventing exfiltration. We identify the goals of transparency, performance, and simplicity. A system designed to prevent exfiltration should not adversely affect the transfer of authorized data and should work with existing protocols. Key to our approach is: i) separating the process of vetting authorized objects from line-speed data verification; and ii) employing a restricted, but compliant, HTTP subset to limit covert channels. In our evaluation, we show that Glavlit adds little overhead to the operation of a software network bridge. ...|$|R
50|$|US President Ronald Reagan {{authorized}} {{the provision of}} aid to KPNLF {{in an effort to}} force an end to the Vietnamese occupation. In 1982, the U.S. government initiated a covert aid program to the non-communist resistance (NCR) amounting to $5 million per year, ostensibly for non-lethal aid only. This amount was increased to $8 million in 1984 and $12 million in 1987 and 1988. In late 1988, the United States pared back CIA funding to $8 million, following reports that $3.5 million had been diverted by the Thai military. At the same time, the Reagan Administration gave new flexibility to the funds, permitting the NCR to purchase US-made weapons in Singapore and other regional markets. In 1985, the United States established a separate, overt aid program to the non-communist resistance which {{came to be known as}} the Solarz Fund after one of its chief sponsors, Rep. Stephen Solarz. The <b>overt</b> aid program <b>channeled</b> about $5 million per year of humanitarian aid to the non-communist resistance through USAID.|$|R
40|$|G protein-gated {{inwardly}} rectifying K+ (GIRK) channels were heterologously {{expressed in}} rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons by intranuclear microinjection. The properties of GIRK channels and their coupling to native receptors were characterized using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Following coinjection of either GIRK 1 – 2 or GIRK 1 – 4 cDNA, application of noradrenaline (NA) produced large inwardly rectifying K+ currents. Injection of cDNA encoding individual GIRK subunits produced only small and inconsistent NA-activated inward currents. Current {{arising from the}} native expression of GIRK channels in SCG neurons was not observed. NA-mediated activation of GIRK channels was abolished by pertussis toxin (PTX) pretreatment, indicating coupling via G proteins of the Gi/Go subfamily. Conversely, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) activated GIRK channel currents via a cholera toxin-sensitive pathway suggesting coupling through Gαs. Pretreatment of neurons with PTX caused {{a significant increase in}} amplitude of the VIP-mediated GIRK channel currents when compared with untreated cells. Application of adenosine, prostaglandin E 2 and somatostatin resulted in activation of GIRK channel currents. Activation of m 1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (i. e. application of oxotremorine m to PTX-treated neurons) failed to elicit <b>overt</b> GIRK <b>channel</b> currents. GIRK channel overexpression decreased basal Ca 2 + channel facilitation significantly when compared with uninjected neurons. Furthermore, the NA-mediated inhibition of Ca 2 + channels was significantly attenuated. In summary, the ability to heterologously express GIRK channels in adult sympathetic neurons allows the experimental alteration of receptor-G protein-effector stoichiometry. Such studies may increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying ion channel modulation by G proteins in a neuronal environment...|$|R
50|$|Therefore, Reagan {{authorized}} the covert provision {{of aid to}} smaller Cambodian resistance movements, referred to collectively as the “non-communist resistance” (NCR) and including the partisans of Norodom Sihanouk and a coalition called the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) then run by Son Sann, {{in an effort to}} force an end to the Vietnamese occupation. In 1982, covert aid amounted to $5 million per year, ostensibly for non-lethal aid only; this amount was increased to $8 million in 1984 and $12 million in 1987 and 1988.

50|$|Faced with a {{destroyed}} {{country and}} lack of international aid, large numbers of distraught Cambodians flocked to the Thai border {{in the years that}} followed. There international help provided by different international aid organisations, many of them backed by the United States, was available. At one point, more than 500,000 Cambodians were living along the Thai-Cambodian border and more than 100,000 in holding centres inside Thailand. More than $400 million was provided between 1979 and 1982, of which the United States, as part of its Cold War political strategy against communist Vietnam, contributed nearly $100 million. In 1982, the US government had initiated a covert aid program to the non-communist resistance (NCR) amounting to $5 million per year, ostensibly for non-lethal aid only.

40|$|Within a {{multilevel}} secure (MLS) system, {{flaws in}} design and implementation can result in <b>overt</b> and covert <b>channels,</b> both {{of which may be}} exploited by malicious software to cause unauthorized information flows. To address this problem, the use of control dependency tracing has been explored to present a precise, formal definition for information flow. This work describes a security Domain Model (DM), designed in the Alloy formal specification language, for conducting static analysis of programs to identify illicit information flows, such as control dependency flaws and covert channel vulnerabilities. The model includes a formal definition for trusted subjects, which are granted extraordinary privileges to perform system operations that require relaxation of the mandatory access control (MAC) policy mechanisms imposed on normal subjects, but are trusted to behave benignly and not to degrade system security. The DM defines the concepts of program state, information flow and security policy rules, and specifies the behavior of a target program. The DM is compiled from a representation of the target program, written in a specialized Implementation Modeling Language (IML), and a specification of the security policy written in the Alloy language. The Alloy Analyzer tool is used to perform static analysis of the DM to detect potential security policy violations in the target program. This approach demonstrates {{that it is possible to}} establish a framework for formally representing a program implementation and for formalizing the security rules defined by a security policy, enabling the verification of that program representation for adherence to the security policy...|$|R
