5|$|A random {{assemblage}} of fish merely using some localised resource {{such as food}} or nesting sites is known simply as an aggregation. When fish come together in an interactive, social grouping, then they may be forming either a shoal or a school depending {{on the degree of}} organisation. A shoal is a loosely organised group where each fish swims and forages independently but is attracted to <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group and adjusts its behaviour, such as swimming speed, so that it remains close to the <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group. Schools of fish are much more tightly organised, synchronising their swimming so that all fish move at the same speed and in the same direction. Shoaling and schooling behaviour is believed to provide a variety of advantages.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{relatively}} few studies {{of learning and}} cognition have been performed on strepsirrhine primates, including ruffed lemurs.

5|$|In 1991 a {{research}} {{group led by}} Clarence A. Ryan, isolated an 18 amino acid polypeptide from tomato leaves that induced the production of protease inhibitor proteins (PIs) in response to wounding. Experiments using synthetic radio-labelled forms of the polypeptide demonstrated that {{it was able to}} travel systemically through the plant and induce PI production in unwounded leaves. Because of the systemic nature of the wounding signal, it was named systemin, it was the first polypeptide found to function as a hormone in plants. mRNA encoding for systemin is found in all tissues of the plant except the roots. Later studies identified homologs of tomato systemin in <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solanaceae including potato, black nightshade and bell pepper. Systemins have only been identified in the Solaneae subtribe of the Solanaceae, but <b>other</b> <b>members</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family, such as tobacco, also respond to wounding by systemically producing protease inhibitors.|$|E
