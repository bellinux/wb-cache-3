5|$|In 2008 the BBC Three series Being Human {{became popular}} in Britain. It {{featured}} an unconventional trio of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who are sharing a flat in Bristol. Another popular vampire-related show is CW's The Vampire Diaries. The continuing {{popularity of the}} vampire theme has been ascribed {{to a combination of}} two factors: the representation <b>of</b> <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> the perennial dread of mortality.|$|E

5|$|As {{genres of}} popular literature, science fiction and fantasy often seem more {{constrained}} than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation {{and the effects}} that these conventions have on depictions <b>of</b> <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> gender. Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre oriented toward a male readership. Sex is often linked to disgust in SF and horror, and plots based on sexual relationships have mainly been avoided in genre fantasy narratives. On the other hand, science fiction and fantasy can also provide more freedom than realistic literature to imagine alternatives to the default assumptions of heterosexuality and masculinity that permeate many cultures. Homosexuality is now an accepted and common feature of science fiction and fantasy literature, its prevalence due {{to the influence of}} lesbian-feminist and gay liberation movements.|$|E

It was reissued in November 2014 as part of a , along with an extended play of new songs. It received acclaim from critics, who praised its production, exploration <b>of</b> <b>sexuality,</b> <b>and</b> Beyoncé's vocals. Beyoncé has sold 5 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Reich {{bought an}} {{oscillograph}} and attached it {{to friends and}} students, who volunteered to touch and kiss each other while Reich read the tracings. One of the volunteers was a young Willy Brandt, the future chancellor of Germany. At the time, {{he was married to}} Reich's secretary, Gertrude Gaasland, and was living in Norway to organize protests against the Nazis. Reich also took measurements from the patients of a psychiatric hospital near Oslo, including catatonic patients, with the permission of the hospital's director. Reich described the oscillograph experiments in 1937 in Experimentelle Ergebniße Über Die Elektrische Funktion von Sexualität und Angst (The Bioelectrical Investigation <b>of</b> <b>Sexuality</b> <b>and</b> Anxiety).|$|E

5|$|In 1999, the PTC {{launched}} a campaign against the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), now World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), complaining that their SmackDown! program contained levels <b>of</b> <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> violence unbecoming prime time programming. In the campaign, Bozell said that four children {{had been killed by}} peers emulating professional wrestling moves learned from the program. With these allegations, Bozell and various PTC members began meeting with representatives of the advertising departments of various companies that advertised on SmackDown! to persuade them to withdraw sponsorship. The PTC also suggested that between 30 and 40 advertisers had pulled their commercials from WWF programming, an assertion that was not true.|$|E
5|$|Not all Heathens {{practice}} seiðr; {{given its}} associations {{with both the}} ambiguity <b>of</b> <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> gender and the gods Odin and Loki in their unreliable trickster forms, many on the Heathen movement's right wing disapprove of it. Although there are heterosexual male practitioners, seiðr is largely associated with women and gay men. One member of the Troth, Edred Thorsson, developed forms of seiðr which involved sex magic utilizing sado-masochistic techniques, something which generated controversy in the community. Part of the discomfort that some Heathens feel toward seiðr surrounds {{the lack of any}} criteria by which the community can determine whether the seiðr-worker has genuinely received divine communication, and the fear that it will be used by some practitioners merely to bolster their own prestige.|$|E
5|$|Science {{fiction and}} fantasy have {{traditionally}} been puritanical genres aimed at a male readership, and can be more restricted than non-genre literature by their conventions of characterisation and the effect that these conventions have on depictions <b>of</b> <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> gender. However, speculative fiction also gives authors and readers the freedom to imagine societies that are different from real-life cultures. This freedom makes speculative fiction a useful means of examining sexual bias, by forcing the reader to reconsider his or her heteronormative cultural assumptions. It has also been claimed by critics such as Nicola Griffith that LGBT readers identify strongly with the mutants, aliens, and other outsider characters found in speculative fiction.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the rhetoric <b>of</b> gender, <b>sexuality,</b> <b>and</b> the family used by the media of the Soviet Union to discuss American and Soviet defectors from 1960 to 1990. Utilizing {{previously}} established historiographies <b>of</b> gender, <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> the family as well as statements from Soviet and American government officials, it is shown that the Soviet government linked gender, <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> family “perversions” to the individualistic and capitalistic ideology of American society, by contrast with the Soviet collectivist and socialist “purity. ” This analysis fills in the gaps in the historiography by connecting studies <b>of</b> gender, <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> family to the practice defection, and situating them in the cultural Cold War context...|$|R

5|$|The initialism, LGBT, is {{intended}} to emphasize a diversity <b>of</b> <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> gender identity-based cultures. It {{may be used to}} refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender, instead of exclusively to people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity; LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996. Those who add intersex people to LGBT groups or organizing use an extended initialism LGBTI. Some people combine the two acronyms and use the term LGBTIQ or LGBTQI. Others use LGBT+ to encompass a spectrum of gender and sexuality.|$|E
5|$|Drugs, devices, surgery, {{and other}} {{interventions}} exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality {{is an important part}} of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development <b>of</b> <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. Body image and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and self-concept. SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of sexuality, which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E

25|$|The Victorian American {{conception}} <b>of</b> <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> other {{roles of}} men and women in society and to one another were being challenged. Modern clothing was lighter and more flexible, better suiting the modern woman such as the flapper who wanted to engage in active sport. Women were now becoming more assertive and less willing to keep the home fires burning. The flappers' costume was seen as sexual and raised deeper questions of the behavior and values it symbolized.|$|E
25|$|The {{central point}} of the Church doctrine, does not, however, lie in the areas <b>of</b> <b>sexuality</b> <b>and</b> {{creation}} but in the doctrine of justification. The human being is always a sinner, completely unable to reach God by his own merit. However, Christians are atoned {{by the grace of}} God, through the sacrifice of Christ, completely undeservedly. The Christian is simultaneously a sinner and a righteous person. At the end of time, Christ will return and subject all to his judgment. Then everlasting perdition can only be avoided by Christ's mercy.|$|E
25|$|Some {{educators}} {{hold the}} view that sexuality is equated with violence. These educators think that not talking about sexuality will decrease the rate of adolescent sexuality.

Not receiving appropriate sexual health education increases teenage pregnancy, sexual victimization and high school dropout rates.
