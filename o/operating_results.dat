2500|$|Under Charney, American Apparel {{implemented}} [...] "team manufacturing" [...] {{as opposed}} to the progressive bundle system of apparel manufacturing. After its implementation, garment production tripled and required a less than 20% staff increase. He formed the company as a domestic vertically-integrated manufacturer, making him the largest manufacturer still producing garments in America. Because of its vertically integrated and domestic manufacturing model, American Apparel's gross margins are actually significantly higher than other basic apparel brands. By utilizing a vertically integrated business model (based on speed-to market), Charney was able to focus merchandise for year round styles, minimizing risk and providing consistent <b>operating</b> <b>results.</b> According to the company, its blended margins are roughly 70% (while GAP averages about 30% and luxury brands like Prada are between 65 and 70%). American Apparel controlled {{a significant portion of the}} value chain to ensure quality, speed to market, and a consistent brand positioning. In December 2007 the company purchased an additional dye house to add to production capacity.|$|E
