He testified that using the equipment at the army lab, at least a year of intensive work would have been required to produce the quantity of spores contained in the letters, and that such an intensive effort could not have escaped the attention of colleagues. Heine also told the panel that lab technicians who worked closely with Ivins have told him they saw no such work. He stated further that where Ivins worked biological containment measures were inadequate to prevent the Anthrax spores from floating out of the laboratory into animal cages and offices. [...] "You'd have had dead animals or dead people," [...] Heine said. According to Science Magazine, [...] "Heine caveated his remarks by saying that he himself had no experience making anthrax stocks." [...] Science magazine provides additional comments by Adam Driks of Loyola who stated that the amount of anthrax in the letters could be made in [...] "a number of days". Emails by Ivins state, [...] "We can presently make 1 X 10^12 [...] spores per week."
