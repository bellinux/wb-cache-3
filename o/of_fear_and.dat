40|$|Intense {{fears are}} commonplace for {{children}} with development disabilities (DD).

In addition, the correlation level between different raters {{in the assessment}} <b>of</b> student <b>fears</b> <b>and</b> related anxieties were examined. Data were collected from public schools and evaluated using Multivariate Analysis of Variance, Analysis of Variance, slice effect test, frequency analysis, and Pearson Product Moment Correlation. Findings {{from the present study}} indicated that students with learning disabilities (LD) reported significantly higher total <b>fear</b> score <b>and</b> higher levels <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> in the two factors <b>of</b> the <b>Fear</b> Survey Schedule for Children-Revised (FSSC-R) : <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> failure <b>and</b> criticism <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> danger <b>and</b> death. In addition, the LD group reported significantly higher overall anxiety level and higher levels of anxiety in all the three subscale scores of Revised Children's Manifest Anxiety Scale (RCMAS). Results showed that girls reported significantly higher scores than did boys in total <b>fear</b> score, intensity <b>of</b> <b>fears,</b> <b>and</b> two factors <b>of</b> FSSC-R [...] <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> unknown <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> injury <b>and</b> small animals. Furthermore, girls in the LD group reported higher total <b>fear</b> score, intensity <b>of</b> <b>fears,</b> <b>and</b> higher levels <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> in all the five factors of FSSC-R than their male counterparts in the same group. On the other hand, girls in the mild mental retardation (MIMR) group reported lower scores in these measures than did their boy counterparts in the same group. Regarding age differences, older students reported significantly higher scores in the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> failure <b>and</b> criticism. In addition, older students in the MIMR group reported higher levels <b>of</b> total <b>fear</b> score, intensity <b>of</b> <b>fears,</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> the unknown, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> danger <b>and</b> death, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> failure <b>and</b> criticism than their younger counterparts. The 10 most common fears yielded from the Fear Survey Schedule for Children-Revised were mostly in the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> danger <b>and</b> death factor.

5|$|After the ban was lifted, Clouzot {{reestablished}} {{his reputation}} and popularity in France {{during the late}} 1940s with successful films including Quai des Orfèvres. After the release of his comedy film Miquette et sa mère, Clouzot married Véra Gibson-Amado, who would star in his next three feature films. In the early and mid-1950s, Clouzot drew acclaim from international critics and audiences for The Wages <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>and</b> Les Diaboliques. Both films would serve as source material for remakes decades later. After the release of La Vérité, Clouzot's wife Véra {{died of a heart}} attack and Clouzot's career suffered due to depression, illness and new critical views of films from the French New Wave. Clouzot's career became less active in later years, limited to a few television documentaries and two feature films in the 1960s. Clouzot wrote several unused scripts in the 1970s and died in Paris in 1977.|$|E

5|$|However, while {{pleasing}} to Riker's mind, the passionate dreams only worsen Riker's condition, as the virus feeds {{on the positive}} endorphins his brain is creating. Pulaski and Counselor Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) therefore agree {{to try to make}} the machine evoke negative dreams instead. Thus Riker dreams of Lieutenant Tasha Yar's (Denise Crosby) death, or the apparent death of Deanna Troi's child (R. J. Williams). This has the desired effect, as the negative endorphins drive the virus away, but the endorphins are not strong enough. As a last resort, Pulaski uses the machine to evoke dreams of raw, primitive feelings <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> survival. Thus Riker dreams of fighting the tar creature Armus (Mart McChesney), the alien-controlled Admiral Gregory Quinn (Ward Costello), and the Klingon officer Klag (Brian Thompson) on board the warship Pagh. Seeing that the raw emotions work best, Pulaski intensifies the dreams to come at a more rapid pace. This finally kills the virus and Riker recovers.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that the architecture of government columbaria reflects the outlook of the Singaporean nation. The early columbaria were simple, with few aesthetic ornaments, just like early Singaporean housing flats. The later columbaria have more modern designs, with well-designed landscaped environments, and looking similar to contemporary HDB (Housing and Development Board) flats. These columbaria include the Chua Chu Kang Columbarium and the Mandai Columbarium, which was renovated and expanded in 2004 to accommodate approximately another 60,000 niches. The designs are more elaborate, and are often reminiscent of other structures people often encounter in everyday life. Comparisons have been drawn between the architecture of these columbaria and that of schools and condominiums, and hypotheses have been made that such are deliberate efforts to eliminate the sense <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> dread traditionally associated with landscapes of death.|$|E

5|$|Summer Glau as River Tam– smuggled {{onto the}} ship by her brother. She {{is a highly}} intelligent, {{compassionate}} and intuitive child prodigy. Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, and at times violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E
5|$|Inquisitive foxes will rotate and flick {{their ears}} whilst sniffing. Playful {{individuals}} will perk their ears and rise on their hind legs. Male foxes courting females, or after successfully evicting intruders, will turn their ears outwardly, {{and raise their}} tails in a horizontal position, with the tips raised upward. When afraid, red foxes grin in submission, arching their backs, curving their bodies, crouching their legs and lashing their tails {{back and forth with}} their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skulls. When merely expressing submission to a dominant animal, the posture is similar, but without arching the back or curving the body. Submissive foxes will approach dominant animals in a low posture, so that their muzzles reach up in greeting. When two evenly matched foxes confront each other over food, they approach each other sideways and push against each other's flanks, betraying a mixture <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> aggression through lashing tails and arched backs without crouching and pulling their ears back without flattening them against their skulls. When launching an assertive attack, red foxes approach directly rather than sideways, with their tails aloft and their ears rotated sideways. During such fights, red foxes will stand on each other's upper bodies with their forelegs, using open mouthed threats. Such fights typically only occur among juveniles or adults of the same sex.|$|E
5|$|Jakobsson {{served as}} the game's artist, designer, and programmer. His levels are made by hand in a {{standalone}} level editor. The designer brushes recurring, cloned elements, such as plants and chains, onto the map. The software combines and processes to add shadow. At one point, Rain World included a multiplayer mode, and separate story and custom modes. Primate, who {{is also known as}} James Therrien, wrote Rain World soundtrack, handled the indie studio's business, and designed levels. Primate first found the game on an indie game Internet forum and sent Jakobsson 12 tracks as a successful pitch. He originally composed a chiptune-style soundtrack with his musician partner Lydia Esrig, but turned to field recordings of litter for otherworldly sounds. Rain World music is low-fi and electronic. Primate wanted the music to approximate the game's eclectic visuals, which mix industrial, science fiction, jungle, and various architectural elements. In lieu of traditional character dialogue and narration, Rain World story was partly communicated through its soundtrack. The early game sound is primitive and based on the Slugcat's feelings <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> hunger, and eventually builds to describe new areas. Rain World has over 3.5 hours of recorded music across 160 tracks. At any given time, between eight and twelve tracks will simultaneously layer to create ambiance and respond to the Slugcat's in-game context. The development team successfully crowdfunded some development costs via Kickstarter in early 2014. By early 2015, about four years into development, the team had switched to the Unity game engine and released a test version of the game to its Kickstarter backers.|$|E

5|$|Roger died in December 1139 {{while in}} the king's custody. After {{the death of his}} uncle, Nigel, then in East Anglia, revolted. In January 1140, he {{fortified}} the Isle of Ely, but was soon besieged and forced to flee. Even his own cathedral chapter refused to support him, and his revolt collapsed in January. Nigel took refuge at the court of Stephen's rival, the Empress Matilda, who had landed in England in the south on 30 September 1139 in a bid to take the throne. The revolt stood little chance of succeeding, for there were no supporters of Matilda close to East Anglia, and it is likely that Nigel reacted more out <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>and</b> anger at his uncle's death than anything else. It appears likely that Nigel appealed to Pope Innocent II at this time, for in October 1140 Innocent issued a papal bull, or papal instruction, ordering the restoration to Nigel of the lands of his bishopric, and it appears that after the capture of Stephen, Matilda managed to restore Nigel to Ely briefly. In 1141, Nigel, along with his brother Alexander, was one of the supporters of Matilda who, after the capture of Stephen by Matilda's forces, reached an agreement with Henry of Blois to replace Stephen with Matilda on the throne. Ultimately, this agreement came to nothing when Matilda's chief supporter, her half-brother Robert of Gloucester, was captured and later exchanged for Stephen. Stephen's release meant that the king was free to send Geoffrey de Mandeville against Nigel, and Nigel submitted to the king, probably in 1142.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{returning}} to France, {{he was offered}} a script written by Georges-Jean Arnaud, an expatriate living in South America who had written about his own experiences there. Clouzot found it easy to imagine {{the setting of the}} script and was very anxious to film Arnaud's story. He started writing the film, The Wages of Fear, with his brother, Jean Clouzot, who would collaborate with him on all his subsequent films under the name of Jérôme Geronimi. Production on The Wages of Fear lasted from 1951 to 1952. In order to gain as much independence as possible, Clouzot created his own production company called Véra Films, which he named after his wife. The sole female role in The Wages of Fear is played by Véra. Clouzot wrote the role specifically for his wife, as the character does not exist in the original novel. The Wages of Fear is about a South American town where a group of desperate men are offered money to drive trucks carrying nitroglycerin through rough terrain to put out an oil well fire. The Wages of Fear was the second most popular film in France in 1953 and was seen by nearly 7million spectators. It won awards for Best Film and Best Actor (for Charles Vanel) at the Cannes Film Festival. Clouzot's next big hit was Diabolique, whose screenplay he took away from director Alfred Hitchcock. Diabolique involves the story of a cruel headmaster who brutalizes his wife and his mistress. The two women murder him and dump his body in a swimming pool, but when the pool is drained, no corpse is found. In 1954, Diabolique won the Louis Delluc Prize and the New York Film Critics Circle Award for best foreign film. In this early and mid-1950s period, with the films The Wages <b>of</b> <b>Fear</b> <b>and</b> Diabolique, Clouzot came to be fully embraced by international critics and audiences. Both films were screened and reviewed in America as well as in France, and were rated among the best thrillers of the decade. In 1955, Clouzot directed the documentary The Mystery of Picasso, about the Spanish painter Pablo Picasso. The film follows Picasso drawing or painting 15 different works, all of which were intentionally destroyed following the film's production. Clouzot and Picasso were old acquaintances, having met when Clouzot was 14. The Mystery of Picasso won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, but was a financial failure in France, being seen by only 37,000 filmgoers during its initial run in 1956. In 1984, the film was declared a national treasure by the government of France.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Fear</b> <b>of</b> falling <b>and</b> {{avoidance}} of activity {{are common in}} old age and are suggested to be (public) health problems of equal importance to falls. Earlier studies <b>of</b> correlates <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling <b>and</b> {{avoidance of}} activity did hardly differentiate between severe <b>and</b> mild levels <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling <b>and</b> avoidance of activity which may be relevant from clinical point of view. Furthermore, most studies focused only on socio-demographics and/or health-related variables and hardly incorporated an extensive range of potential correlates <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling including psychosocial variables. This study analyzes the univariate and multivariate associations between five socio-demographic, seven health-related and six psychosocial variables <b>and</b> levels <b>of</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling <b>and</b> avoidance of activity in older persons who avoid activity due to <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling. Methods Cross-sectional study in 540 community-living older people aged ≥ 70 years with at least mild <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling <b>and</b> avoidance of activity. Chi-squares, t-tests and logistics regression analyses were performed to study the associations between the selected correlates and both outcomes. Results Old age, female sex, limitations in activity of daily living, impaired vision, poor perceived health, chronic morbidity, falls, low general self-efficacy, low mastery, loneliness, feelings of anxiety and symptoms of depression were identified as univariate correlates <b>of</b> severe <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling <b>and</b> avoidance of activity. Female sex, limitations in activity of daily living and one or more falls in the previous six months correlated independently with severe <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling. Higher age and limitations in activity of daily living correlated independently with severe avoidance of activity. Conclusion Psychosocial variables did not contribute independently {{to the difference between}} mild <b>and</b> severe <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling <b>and</b> to the difference between mild and severe avoidance of activity due to <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling. Although knowledge about the unique associations of specific variables with levels <b>of</b> severe <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling <b>and</b> avoidance of activity is of interest for theoretical reasons, knowledge of univariate association may also help to specify the concepts for developing interventions and programmes to reduce <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> falling <b>and</b> avoidance of activity in old age, particularly in their early stages of development. </p...|$|R

In {{an effort to}} explore self-compassion as a potential resource for young women athletes, we explored relations among self-compassion, proneness to self-conscious emotions (i. e., shame, guilt-free shame, guilt, shame-free guilt, authentic pride, and hubristic pride), and potentially unhealthy self-evaluative thoughts and behaviors (i. e., social physique anxiety, obligatory exercise, objectified body consciousness, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> failure, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> negative evaluation). Young women athletes (N = 151; Mage = 15. 1 years) participated in this study. Self-compassion was negatively related to shame proneness, guilt-free shame proneness, social physique anxiety, objectified body consciousness, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> failure, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> negative evaluation. In support of theoretical propositions, self-compassion explained variance beyond self-esteem on shame proneness, guilt-free shame proneness, shame-free guilt proneness, objectified body consciousness, <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> failure, <b>and</b> <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> negative evaluation.
