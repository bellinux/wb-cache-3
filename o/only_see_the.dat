25|$|The temple can be {{seen from}} afar, but passers-by can <b>only</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> cella, the {{foundations}} of which are decoratively rusticated. Seven columns are spaced along the cella, linking to the lateral door, which opens onto the staircase. The tetrastyle temple is built in Tuscan order in antis. The temple's design is unusual inasmuch as temples of the imperial cult are generally Corinthian and located {{in the middle of a}} vast courtyard with a portico; the Tuscan order was thus quite rare in the provinces.|$|E
25|$|The park {{received}} an estimated 15 million visitors each year, and daily visits exceed 250,000. Sunday {{is the most}} popular day to visit because the museums are free, and visitors may spend the entire day in one or more sections viewing the attractions, picnicking, or grilling. Despite its local popularity, however, foreign visitors usually <b>only</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> small fraction of the park near the museums. The park is easy to get to via public transportation. Metro Lines 1 and 7 have stations at park entrances to the east and south respectively. Several bus lines along Paseo de la Reforma.|$|E

25|$|Early {{infrared}} homing missiles had two {{limitations that}} made them difficult to use in combat situations. The first was that the seeker was relatively insensitive and required large, hot sources to reliably track a target. In practice, this meant the engine of the enemy aircraft had to remain visible to the missile though the shot. The other was that the seeker had a limited field of view (FOV), meaning it could <b>only</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> target if it {{was in front of}} the missile. This meant it was possible for the target to escape by flying at right angles to the missile, maximizing its angular velocity relative to the seeker.|$|E
25|$|Socrates then broaches {{the initial}} {{question}} of whether virtue is one or many things, himself claiming that all virtue is knowledge and therefore one. He argues that the reason people act harmfully, to others or themselves, is because they <b>only</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> short term gains while ignoring the long term losses which might outweigh them, just like one makes errors in judging the size of objects that are far away. He says that if men were taught the art of calculating these things correctly, have a more exact knowledge that is, they would not act harmfully (357c–358d). Same goes for bravery. A brave swimmer is one {{who knows how to}} swim better and therefore, in a way, all virtues are essentially knowledge and can be considered one and the same, more like parts of golden objects (as discussed above) rather than the parts of a face. While Socrates seems to have won the argument, he points to the fact that if all virtue is knowledge, it can in fact be taught. He draws the conclusion that to an observer he and Protagoras would seem as crazy, having argued at great lengths only to mutually exchanged positions with Socrates now believing that virtue can be taught and Protagoras that all virtues are one instead of his initial position (361a). Protagoras acknowledges Socrates a notable opponent in dispute while being much younger than he and predicts that he could become one of the wisest men alive. Socrates departs for whatever business he claimed he had when he wanted to end the dialogue earlier.|$|E

500|$|The film also {{received}} mixed reviews from other critics. Ananda Vikatan said, [...] "Though {{this effort to}} improve the quality of Tamil cinema must be appreciated, we do not see the dignity of the epic and <b>only</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> dominance of the extravaganza." [...] In 2012, Baradwaj Rangan called the film [...] "a historical epic with little so-called relevance to contemporary life (unless you want to acknowledge the Duryodhana-Karna storyline as the granddaddy of today's bromances)" [...] and stated that Ganesan's performance [...] "isn't as all-consuming as his performance in, say, The Mahabharata, after all, is a tale with an ensemble cast, unlike The Ramayana with its solo hero", while calling Rama Rao's performance a [...] "sly, campy take on Krishna".|$|E
500|$|Though {{he was an}} {{obstetrician}} {{rather than}} a pediatrician, DeLee became the greatest advocate of the infant incubator in the U.S. At that time, obstetricians dealt {{with the problems of}} the premature baby after birth, where pediatricians were likely to <b>only</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> survivors of prematurity many days later. The pediatricians – influenced by their experiences taking care of other types of malnourished children – thought it was essential for the babies to be exposed to sunlight. For most pediatricians, it seemed counterintuitive to enclose the babies in a box. By 1901, DeLee had built an entire incubator transport service staffed with specially trained nurses, but costs were high and maternity hospitals still did not attract many private patients. The funds ran out on the incubator station in 1908.|$|E

500|$|Stan {{goes to the}} doctor, who, after {{examining}} him, diagnoses him as a [...] "cynical asshole". From ice cream to movie trailers, Stan can now <b>only</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> bad in things, and this negative outlook alienates him from Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman, who begin avoiding him. When Stan catches them secretly {{going to the movies}} without him after lying about having the flu, he comes along, only for his attitude to ruin the trailers and Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman leave the theater. Cartman then coldly informs Stan that {{they do not want to}} hang out with him anymore and leaves with Kenny. As Stan and Kyle argue over this, Stan literally sees Kyle as a large piece of feces that defecates instead of talking, indicating that he sees them as [...] "shit".|$|E
500|$|The {{underwater}} scenes {{shot from}} the shark's point of view have been compared with passages in two 1950s horror films, Creature from the Black Lagoon and The Monster That Challenged the World. Gottlieb named two science fiction productions from the same era as influences on how the shark was depicted, or not: The Thing from Another World, which Gottlieb described as [...] "a great horror film where you <b>only</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> monster in the last reel"; and It Came From Outer Space, where [...] "the suspense was built up because the creature was always off-camera". Those precedents helped Spielberg and Gottlieb to [...] "concentrate on showing the 'effects' of the shark rather than the shark itself". Scholars such as Thomas Schatz described how Jaws melds various genres while essentially being an action film and a thriller. Most is taken from horror, with {{the core of a}} nature-based monster movie while adding elements of a slasher film. The second half provides a buddy film in the interaction between the crew of the Orca, and a supernatural horror based on the shark's depiction of a nearly Satanic menace.|$|E
500|$|Reese and Wernick were on set every day, which Reynolds {{personally}} {{paid for}} after Fox was unwilling to. The writers had scripted the action very specifically, [...] "every kill and almost down to every punch, kick, or shot", but Tim Miller and the stunt coordinators {{were free to}} change this. Robert Alonzo and Philip J. Silvera were the stunt coordinators for the film; Silvera had provided motion capture reference for the test footage. The stunt team had a month before filming began to prepare the actors, with Skrein working [...] "nonstop" [...] to prepare. Silvera said Reynolds [...] "has a photographic memory; he'd do something {{three or four times}} and remember it very well." [...] A lot of the jokes in the film were improvised on set, particularly by Reynolds. He said that the actors often came up with around 15 alternate jokes for each one written in the script, and were generally only limited to those because of time constraints. Reese said, for example, Wernick had written some jokes for the scene where Deadpool visits Colossus and Negasonic, but on set Reynolds improvised the line [...] "You know it’s funny how I <b>only</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> two of you here. It’s like the studio couldn’t afford any more X-Men." [...] This was based in truth, and became then Fox chairman Jim Gianopulos’ favorite line.|$|E

500|$|Moderation points add to a user's rating, {{which is}} known as [...] "karma" [...] on Slashdot. Users with high [...] "karma" [...] are {{eligible}} to become moderators themselves. The system does not promote regular users as [...] "moderators" [...] and instead assigns five moderation points {{at a time to}} users {{based on the number of}} comments they have entered in the system [...] once a user's moderation points are used up, they can no longer moderate articles (though they can be assigned more moderation points at a later date). Paid staff editors have an unlimited number of moderation points. A given comment can have any integer score from −1 to +5, and registered users of Slashdot can set a personal threshold so that no comments with a lesser score are displayed. For instance, a user reading Slashdot at level +5 will <b>only</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> highest rated comments, while a user reading at level −1 will see a more [...] "unfiltered, anarchic version". A meta-moderation system was implemented on September 7, 1999, to moderate the moderators and help contain abuses in the moderation system. Meta-moderators are presented with a set of moderations that they may rate as either fair or unfair. For each moderation, the meta-moderator sees the original comment and the reason assigned by the moderator (e.g. troll, funny), and the meta-moderator can click to see the context of comments surrounding the one that was moderated.|$|E
