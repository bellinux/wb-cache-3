5|$|By the 9th century CE, {{literature}} {{written in}} Sinhalese script had emerged and the script {{began to be}} used in <b>other</b> <b>contexts.</b> For instance, the Buddhist literature of the Theravada-Buddhists of Sri Lanka, written in Pali, used the Sinhalese alphabet.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Greek art, {{as found}} in pottery and other remains, {{frequently}} depicts scenes associated with Troilus' death: the ambush, the pursuit, the murder itself and the fight over his body. Depictions of Troilus in <b>other</b> <b>contexts</b> are unusual. One such exception, a red-figure vase painting from Apulia c.340BC, shows Troilus as a child with Priam.|$|E
5|$|A {{particular}} {{definition of}} Mitică and mitici {{was adopted by}} many inhabitants of Transylvania, who used the terms in reference to either Bucharest-based politicians or inhabitants of the city at large, and contrasted them with their counterparts to the northwest. The character has thus evolved to include a stereotypical view of contemporary Bucharesters or Wallachians, one which depicts them as , arrogant, aggressive and cunning. In <b>other</b> <b>contexts,</b> the mitici {{may be seen as}} not having an adequate familiarity with the culture of Transylvania, and are associated with the Balkans (whereas Transylvania is identified with Central Europe).|$|E

5|$|Most {{people like}} themselves; the {{birthday}} {{is associated with}} the self, and hence the numbers in the birthday are preferred, {{despite the fact that they}} appear in many <b>other</b> <b>contexts.</b> People who do not like themselves tend not to exhibit the birthday-number effect. A similar effect, the name-letter effect, has been found for letters: people tend to prefer the letters that are part of their name. The birthday-number effect and the name-letter effect are significantly correlated. In psychological assessments, the Number Preference Task is used to estimate implicit self-esteem.|$|E
5|$|Two other fragmentary {{copies of}} the same decree were {{discovered}} later, and several similar Egyptian bilingual or trilingual inscriptions are now known, including two slightly earlier Ptolemaic decrees (the Decree of Canopus in 238 BC, and the Memphis decree of PtolemyIV, c. 218 BC). The Rosetta Stone is, therefore, no longer unique, {{but it was the}} essential key to modern understanding of Ancient Egyptian literature and civilisation. The term Rosetta Stone is now used in <b>other</b> <b>contexts</b> as the name for the essential clue to a new field of knowledge.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} {{name of the}} German state in 1871 became Deutsches Reich, linking itself to the former Reich before 1806. This expression was commonly used in official papers and also on maps, while in <b>other</b> <b>contexts</b> Deutschland was more frequently used.|$|E
25|$|The main {{interest}} in Dynkin diagrams {{are as a}} means to classify semisimple Lie algebras over algebraically closed fields. This gives rise to Weyl groups, i.e. to many (although not all) finite reflection groups. Dynkin diagrams may also arise in <b>other</b> <b>contexts.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to tuberculin skin tests such as (principally) the Mantoux test, interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) have become common in clinical {{use in the}} 2010s.

25|$|Evolutionarily stable {{strategies}} were originally considered for biological evolution, {{but they can}} apply to <b>other</b> <b>contexts.</b> In fact, there are stable states for a large class of adaptive dynamics.
