40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate {{the design of the}} low speed direct driven multiphase PM generator for wind applications in which high voltage system is established by the use of a multilevel converter topology. An approach taken in this thesis for design of multiphase generator is that the generator is a multiphase <b>open</b> <b>winding</b> generator (i. e. both terminals (ends) of each winding are made accessible resulting in 12 terminals for a six phase machine). The generator studied in this thesis is a multi-pole, 6 phase <b>open</b> <b>winding</b> PM generator with concentrated winding system. Two types of such 6 phase generators are investigated in this thesis paper. One is 6 phase <b>open</b> <b>winding</b> generator with 60 degree phase shift between each phase and the other is a dual 3 phase <b>open</b> <b>winding</b> generator with 30 degree phase shift between each set. This generator configuration allows the use of multilevel converter topology with cascaded dc links which is not possible in generators with multi-star configurations. For the design and analysis of 6 phase <b>open</b> <b>winding</b> generator, a 120 slot, 116 poles PM generator with single layer concentrated winding has been chosen. The star of slot method has been used to obtain the winding configuration required for the generatorThe numerical and analytical methods are used to calculate different parameters of the test generator 2 like air gap flux, average flux density in the air gap, flux linkage in a phase, induced EMF, flux density distribution, inductances of the machine and also the cogging torque. Moreover, the effect of slotting of the generator on the flux density distribution due to magnet has also been investigated using analytical approach. The dynamic model equations for both 6 phase <b>open</b> <b>winding</b> RFPM generator (i. e. 60 degree phase shift generator and 30 degree phase shift generator) have been developed using the dq theory. Based on those equations, the simulation models have been developed which are used to study the behavior of generator on connecting 2 level converter topology with cascaded dc link and boost chopper. A lab experiment has also been carried out on the test generator to study the behavior of 6 phase <b>open</b> <b>winding</b> generator when it is connected to a 2 level converter topology. Out of many results observed in the lab, one prime result was the voltage stress in the winding insulation and it was found to be close to but lower than the induced voltage per phase. Therefore, it can be concluded that the voltage stress in the winding insulation is not a problem for this generator configuration. The value of cogging torque obtained from the lab test and that obtained from the analytical approach are satisfactorily close. Moreover, it is very low compared to the nominal torque of the PM generator which is one the main advantages of single layer concentrated winding PM machines. However, the other results obtained from the lab and those obtained from the simulations i. e. current drawn and the electromagnetic torque, do not match. So, more work is required on the improvement of generator model so that it can emulate the lab results to a satisfactory level. However, from the simulation results, it was also observed that for the same rectifier-converter-load topology, from the generator s perspective, whether the 6 phase <b>open</b> <b>winding</b> generator is configured with 60 degree phase shift or is configured as dual 3 phase <b>open</b> <b>winding</b> generator with 30 degree phase shift, the two models of generator behaves similarly. There is not any typical advantage of dual 3 phase <b>open</b> <b>winding</b> generator with 30 degree phase shift over 6 phase <b>open</b> <b>winding</b> generator with 60 degree phase shift or vice versa. The above conclusion has been drawn based on the generator s behavior only (i. e. output generator voltage, current drawn from the generator and mean electromagnetic torque) but if we see from the converters perspective, the conclusion might be different and since it is not in the scope of this thesis, it has not been considered here...|$|E

40|$|The phased {{microphone}} array technique {{is a well}} established tool in aeroacoustic testing for the localisation and quantification of sound sources.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} focused on the torque {{production}} and control strategies of variable flux reluctance machines (VFRMs). Based on energy conservation, an instantaneous torque equation is developed and analysed, which reveals the contributions of harmonic currents and inductances to the torque production. By using Fourier series, all of the harmonics in the phase currents and winding inductances are considered. It was found that the average torque of a 6 / 4 VFRM is mainly produced by the dc, fundamental and second harmonic components of the phase currents. Based on the derived torque equation, magnitudes and phases of the current harmonics are optimised so that the average torque is maximised under a given rms current. Undesirable level of torque ripple was found, due to the inductance harmonics. The third harmonic torque ripple is dominant in the 6 / 4 VFRM, whilst the 6 / 7 VFRM has a lower magnitude sixth harmonic component. In order to reduce the torque ripple, a harmonic field current is injected. Since the torque ripple reduction method utilises the machine parameters, the influence of the parameter mismatch is investigated. The torque waveforms predicted by the derived torque equation are compared with the results directly calculated by 2 D-finite element analysis (FEA). Additionally, the experimental results verify that the derived torque equations can predict the torque production of the VFRMs to a good degree of accuracy. In order to improve the machine efficiency and extend the operating speed range, an integrated field and armature current control strategy has been proposed. The field and armature currents are injected into a single coil as a sinusoidal current biased by a dc offset, rather than a separate field and armature winding. In the integrated current control scheme, a zero sequence current generates a virtual rotor flux as the field current, whilst the three-phase sinusoidal currents produce a rotating stator field. The zero sequence current is generated by adjusting the on-time of zero vectors between two inverters. In the case of the 6 / 4 VFRM, an <b>open</b> <b>winding</b> configuration is utilised since the field and armature windings have the same polarity in each tooth winding. In contrast, a dual three-phase winding configuration having a neutral point is adopted for the 6 / 7 VFRM, due to the opposite polarity between the field and armature windings. For the vector control, the voltage and torque equations are derived in the synchronous dq-axis frame. With the aid of MATLAB/Simulink, these equations are also utilised for the dynamic simulation. The simulation and experimental results validate that the proposed strategy can effectively increase the efficiency and extend the operating speed range of the VFRMs. As an extended work, a torque ripple reduction method is also applied to the integrated current control by injecting harmonic components into the zero sequence current...|$|E

40|$|IMs are an {{important}} part of the industry as they provide convenience through their simple construction and a minimum maintenance. In addition they are highly rigid and reliable. They are mostly used in compressors, fans and pumps, but their usage has progressed to a much advanced level such as, aircrafts, space shuttles and military applications. These operations are crucial and cannot tolerate compromise in reliability and safety. This thesis aims at exploring the fault tolerant control of the IMs. This involves sensor based closed loop vector control for a healthy IM, Variable frequency with constant flux(V/F) closed loop for both stator <b>open</b> <b>winding</b> and stator short winding faults, V/F open loop to control the drive in case of minimum voltage fault and using the sensorless vector control in case of encoder faults. The model that has been suggested for the fault tolerant control has been verified through a 0. 5 hp IM with the inclusion of condition monitoring and protection against the above faults. A platform of more than 13 trips has been included in this work. The faults will be classified according to the location, severity and the time. The speed for the sensorless vector control and closed loop V/F controllers is evaluated through the model reference adaptive control estimator. There are two steps in the fault tolerant control process; in the first step the fault is identified with the feature extraction module, a fault decision module and a feature cluster module. After that the controller is redesigned accordingly. In this work however, the fault protection is an additional feature of the control system, where the wavelet based fault tolerant system has been tested and simulated using a 1 kW IM, which has a short stator winding and sensor faults, while the primary faults are open stator winding. The additional fault presented to the system is under voltage. The wavelet packed decomposition covers the transient and steady state regions of the IM operations with respect to both time and frequency domain. The motor features are extracted through the proposed Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based analysis method, while the wavelet inlet acts as an expert tool to adapt the right controller in accordance with the fault type. The fault detection algorithm identifies the time and location of each fault. The optimal levels of decomposition of the stator current error signal and mother wavelet function are selected with the help of the maximum entropy and description length data. The effect of faults and the effectiveness of the fault tolerant algorithm is demonstrated by observing the speed response of the induction machine, which is the strategy adopted by the majority of researchers in this area. The reliability and the effectiveness of the proposed DWT based fault tolerant controller will be confirmed by the simulation and experimental results on the 1 kW IM. This will further ascertain the effectiveness of the controller for high performance motor drive applications in the industry...|$|E
