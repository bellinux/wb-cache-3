5|$|Body {{piercing}} jewellery should be hypoallergenic. A number of materials are used, with varying strengths and weaknesses. Surgical stainless steel, niobium and titanium {{are commonly used}} metals, with titanium {{the least likely to}} cause allergic reaction of the three. Platinum and palladium are also safe alternatives, even in fresh piercings. Initial piercings should never be done with gold of any grade, as gold is mixed with other metals, and sterling silver is not a good alternative in a piercing, as it may cause allergies in initial piercings and will tarnish in piercings <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>age.</b> An additional risk for allergic reaction may arise when the stud or clasp of jewellery is made from a different metal than the primary piece.|$|E

5|$|Touching is an {{important}} form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals <b>of</b> <b>any</b> <b>age</b> and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching {{is especially important for}} mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.|$|E

In this work, a composite structure made of different foam {{was applied to the}} frontal body of a public transport vehicles running on rails (commonly called tram) in order to reduce risks for pedestrian impacting against it. Experimental tests were performed to study different sacrificial material configurations and numerical simulations were used to define the foam material model throughout an optimization process. Some final considerations are here shown...|$|R
