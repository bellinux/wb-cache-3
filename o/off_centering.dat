Thus, nonlinear-optical processes in such cavities are ideally suited for the generation of broadband or tunable electromagnetic radiation. Experimentally and theoretically, we investigate the tunability of optical parametric oscillation in a radially structured WGR made of lithium niobate. With a 1. 04 µm pump wave, the signal and idler waves are tuned from 1. 78 to 2. 5 µm including the point of degeneracy by varying the temperature between 20 and 62 °C.

In contrast to bulk SrTiO 3, strongly distorted O octahedra are observed in the SrTiO 3 layers with a systematic <b>off</b> <b>centering</b> of the Ti atoms. The systems favour ferromagnetic spin ordering rather than the antiferromagnetic spin ordering of bulk LaMnO 3 and all show half-metallicity, while a systematic reduction of the minority spin band gaps {{as a function of the}} LaMnO 3 and SrTiO 3 layer thicknesses originates from modifications of the Ti dxy states...|$|E

40|$|Measurements were {{performed}} on the 30, 40, and 60 mm 90 Sr/Y β-emitter source trains used in the Novoste Beta-Cath system to determine their dosimetric characteristics at submillimeter distances and provide the necessary TG- 60 parameters for mapping their dose distributions. These measurements were carried out in a Solid Water™ phantom where MD 55 - 2 Gafchromic™ films were placed {{in direct contact with}} a 5 French (F) catheter used for the 30 and 60 mm source trains and a 3. 5 F catheter used for thinner 30 and 40 mm source trains. A data set consisted of three pieces of Gafchromic film irradiated for periods of 1. 5, 5, and 10 minutes, respectively. This 3 -film irradiation technique provided reliable dose data at short, intermediate and long distances from a source train. Three data sets per source train were collected in this study. For the 30 mm source train with a 5 F catheter, data were collected with the source axis at proximal (0. 41 mm) and distal (1. 19 mm) positions to the film surface in order to investigate dosimetric effects due to the <b>off</b> <b>centering</b> of the source train lumen within the catheter. Absolute doses were determined by calibrating the Gafchromic film in a high-energy electron beam from a radiotherapy accelerator. The absolute dose rates at a distance of 2 mm along the source trains transverse axis were found to be within 13. 7 % of the values provided by Novoste. Radial dose functions were within 13 % compared to 90 Sr/Y source train data constructed from Soares' 90 Sr/Y single seed data and within 17 % and 25 % compared to Monte Carlo data by Ye et al., and Wang et al., respectively. Discrepancies of 33 % and 19 % were observed at short radial distances (≤ 1 mm) between the Novoste Monte Carlo and the 3. 5 F and 5 F catheter measured data, respectively. The source <b>off</b> <b>centering</b> data showed higher dose contribution from the source train at its distal rather than proximal position. Radial dose function comparisons between the Novoste Monte Carlo and the measured data, calculated as a function of radial distance from the catheter's center showed good agreement (≤ 10 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The cubic spinel CdCr$_ 2 $S$_ 4 $ gained {{recently}} a vivid interest, given {{the relevance of}} relaxor-like dielectric behavior in its paramagnetic phase. By a singular combination of local probe techniques namely Pair Distribution Function and Perturbed Angular Correlation we firmly establish that the Cr ion plays the central key role on this exotic phenomenon, namely through a dynamic off-centering displacement of its coordination sphere. We further show that this <b>off</b> <b>centering</b> of the magnetic Cr-ion {{gives rise to a}} peculiar entanglement between the polar and magnetic degrees of freedom, stabilizing, in the paramagnetic phase, short range magnetic clusters, clearly seen in ultra-low field susceptibility measurements. Moreover, the Landau theory is here used to demonstrate that a linear coupling between the magnetic and polar order parameters is sufficient to justify the appearance of magnetic cluster in paramagnetic phase of this compound. These results open insights on the hotly debated magnetic and polar interaction, setting a step forward in the reinterpretation of the coupling of different physical degrees of freedom...|$|E

It has been shown that, {{with an increase in}} the praseodymium concentration, the temperature of the structural phase transition to the phase with space group I 4 mcm increases and, at x amp; 8805; 0. 15, the structure at 300 K is tetragonal. X ray absorption fine structure XAFS spectroscopy studies have revealed that Pr ions are predominantly in the charge state 3 and occupy the Sr sites. No indications of the <b>off</b> <b>centering</b> of Pr atoms at the Sr sites have been revealed. The local environment of Pr atoms is characterized by a strong relaxation of the oxygen atoms, the value of which corresponds to the difference between the ionic radii of Pr 3 and Sr 2.

40|$|We present {{integral}} field spectroscopy of NGC 5033, a low luminosity Seyfert galaxy. The {{observations were}} made with INTEGRAL, a fiber based system operating at the WHT. The intensity map of the H emission line represents a spiral or ring-like pattern of HII regions. On the contrary, the [OIII] intensity map morphology is markedly anisotropic. The strong morphological differences imply that the [OIII] emitters represent highly ionized gas illuminated by the central source. The [OIII] map morphology is compatible with a biconical structure of ionization induced by strong extinction in the galaxy disc that also obscures half of the spheroidal stellar bulge. We identify the spectrum corresponding to the Seyfert 1 nucleus from the presence of H broad emission lines. This spectrum {{is located in a}} region where strong extinction is expected but exhibits the bluest spectral energy distribution. The Seyfert 1 nucleus seems to be off center with respect to the stellar rotation center. This result has been also found in other Seyfert galaxies and interpreted in terms of a past merger. The <b>off</b> <b>centering</b> could indicate the presence of nonsymmetric departures in the gravitational potential which could be fueling the active nucleus. The kinematics of the [OIII] emitters show important deviations at a kpc scale with respect to the stellar velocity field and show features related to the asymmetrical morphology of the high ionization region...|$|E
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado a la 20 th International Conference on Solid Compounds of Transition Elements, celebrada del 11 al 15 de abril de 2016 en Zaragoza (España). Engineering {{strain in}} oxides is a {{promising}} route for the quest of thin film materials with coexisting ferroic orders, multiferroics, with efficient magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature. Precise {{control of the}} strain gradient would enable custom tailoring of the multiferroic properties, but presently remains challenging. Promising intrinsic multiferroics are some manganites with the cubic ABO 3 perovskite structure. For instance, previous works {{have shown that the}} antiferromagnetic paraelectric SrMnO 3 (SMO) could become ferroelectric upon artificial expansion of the unit cell by epitaxial strain. In this case, the induced lattice distortion is expected to induce ferroelectricity by the <b>off</b> <b>centering</b> of the magnetic cation Mn 4 +. In this work we explore the existence of polar gradients induced by epitaxial strain in 10 -nm-thick SMO thin films grown by pulsed laser deposition on LSAT (100) substrates, whose polar nature was predicted theoretically, and recently observed experimentally. Aberrationcorrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) experiments have been carried out to determine the strain fields and the local atomic displacements within the unit cell from Annular Bright Field (ABF) images with atomic resolution. As a result, we map the polar rotation of the ferroelectric polarization at atomic resolution, both far from and near the domain walls and find flexoelectricity resulting from vertical strain gradients (see Fig. 1). The origin of this particular strain state is a gradual distribution of oxygen vacancies across the film thickness, according to electron energy loss spectroscopy. Herein we present a chemistry-mediated route to induce polar rotations in oxygen-deficient multiferroic films, resulting in flexoelectric polar rotations and with potentially enhanced piezoelectricityPeer reviewe...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{exploits}} the potentials of the <b>off</b> <b>centered</b> void. While geometric rigidity confines {{the conventional}} void, eccentric alignments in Void <b>Off</b> <b>Center</b> escape those defining boundaries. These eccentricities extend {{the influence of}} the void to open up new possibilities for both program and circulation. Void <b>Off</b> <b>Center</b> uses a system of axial voids and lobes. Like an engine's camshaft, this setup can be tuned to regulate the parts and movements of the larger whole. Embedded into the plate structure, this combination of voids and lobes catalyzes an agile spatial constellation. These potentials are tested in the design of a museum. Proposed as an expansion to Houston's Museum of Fine Arts, this project organizes each of the main museum functions (exhibition, public, service) around a particular void, giving each an identity. Program in Void <b>Off</b> <b>Center</b> resists conforming to spatial definition. Voids animate programmatic boundaries as walls, floor plates, and material surfaces intersect or lap each other, creating multiple interactions.
