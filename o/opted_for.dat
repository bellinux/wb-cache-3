5|$|Airline {{customers}} were uninterested in the 767-X proposals, and instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and a operating cost lower than any 767 stretch.

By 1988, Boeing realized that the only answer was a new clean–sheet design, which became the 777 twinjet. The company <b>opted</b> <b>for</b> the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits.

The new design that von Neumann and T (for theoretical) Division, most notably Rudolf Peierls, had devised used explosive lenses to focus the explosion onto a spherical shape using a combination of both slow and fast high explosives.|$|E
