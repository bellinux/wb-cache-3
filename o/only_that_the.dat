5|$|In {{the later}} Middle Ages, {{the text of}} the Libellus was used to support the claims of the monks of the Canterbury Cathedral chapter that the chapter had always {{included}} monks, back to the founding of the cathedral by Augustine. But the Libellus does not explicitly say that the cathedral chapter should be composed of monks, <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> monks that were members of the chapter should live in common and have some other aspects of monastic life.|$|E
5|$|The {{demographic}} decline due to {{the plague}} had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30 to 40% {{in most parts of}} Europe between 1350 and 1400. Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. The survivors of the plague found not <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives.|$|E
5|$|According to the Mexican authorities, {{the murder}} plot was {{possibly}} {{carried out with}} the collaboration of the Tijuana Cartel because no security measures were taken during the party and because the entrances were {{open to the public}} (when they are usually closed for private events). The investigation was further {{complicated by the fact that}} many of the invitees—fearing for their lives—fled from the scene when Francisco Rafael was killed by the clown. Out of the 80 to 100 attendees, only 20 of them stayed, many of them family members and employees of the banquet hall. When the authorities interrogated those who stayed and asked them whether they had recognized the assassin or any other physical features, none of them were able to give any details. Some stated that they did not even pay attention to the clown when he entered the crime scene, while others stated that they did not even recall exactly what the clown was wearing, remembering <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> assassin was wearing a blue-stripped or purple shirt, a multicolored wig, and a red clown nose.|$|E

5|$|Follow-up imaging {{took place}} on July 2, 2009 and August 30, 2010 using the same instruments, as astronomers hoped to reveal this {{companion}} object's proper motion, or the rate that it moves over time. Additional follow-up data was recovered {{in the spring and}} summer of 2010, but large errors in the data's astrometry led the investigating astronomers to disregard it. The observations over the three years was compiled, with the data used to filter out pixelated portions of the images and improve the images' quality. The result suggested not <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> faint object in the image was nearby the star HIP 78530, but that it was a brown dwarf or planet in size. Further study would be needed to prove its true nature.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of ministerial discretion, it has been {{established}} in Carltona Ltd. v. Commissioner of Works (1943) that it is not unlawful for a civil servant to take a decision on behalf of the minister, even where a statute confers discretion on a minister. Parliament will expect <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> power is to be exercised by an appropriate official. However, the minister is ultimately responsible for decisions taken on his or her behalf. While there has been discussion in case law about whether a minister should be required to personally exercise discretion in decisions that affect a person's liberty, the courts have usually been reluctant to hold so. Such a requirement, however, has been made by way of statutes which require the minister to act personally.|$|E
5|$|Later at the tavern, {{a police}} {{inspector}} from London named Morrison (István Lénárt) discusses with Brown {{the matter of}} the stolen money. Morrison claims to be working on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> money is returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he should tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a side door. Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation.|$|E

5|$|Peter K. Bol {{asserts that}} the {{supporters}} of Wang Anshi's expansionist, activist central government in his New Policies were convinced that he understood the dao which brought utopia to Western Zhou (c. 1050 BC – 771 BC) antiquity and were determined to conform society according to his vision. The marginalised emperor – the last remaining aristocrat with any true political power – embraced the fiction that he was like the sage kings of old who brought society {{into a state of}} total harmony with court rituals and policy reforms. Yet after the reign of Emperor Huizong, Song rulers and officials alike disregarded the New Policies and focused instead on reforming society through a local, bottom-up approach. For example, Emperor Huizong attempted from 1107–1120 to bar anyone who had not attended a government school from serving in public office. He thus rejected anyone who did not acknowledge his brand of Confucian ideology as orthodoxy. However, the government-run school system during the Southern Song eventually lost prominence to private academies, which had outnumbered government schools during the early Northern Song. Even before Emperor Huizong's reign, Sima Guang (1019–1086), a prominent chancellor and political rival to Wang Anshi, had little to say about the emperor's role in shaping major reforms and public policy, mentioning <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> emperor made major appointments when necessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{wreckage}} was too severely fragmented {{to determine}} the exact position of the rudders, elevators, flaps, and slats before impact and examination of eyewitness photographs showed <b>only</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> right wing slats were fully extended as the crew tried unsuccessfully to correct the steep roll they were in. The left wing slats could not be determined from the blurry color photographs, so they were sent to a laboratory in Palo Alto, California for digital analysis, a process that was pushing the limits of 1970s technology and necessitated large, complicated, and expensive equipment. The photographs were reduced to black-and-white, which {{made it possible to}} distinguish the slats from the wing itself and thus proved that they were retracted. In addition, it was also verified that the tail section of the aircraft was undamaged and the landing gear was down.|$|E
