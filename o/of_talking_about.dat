5|$|Traditionally, {{religious}} {{language has}} been explained as via negativa, analogy, symbolism, or myth, {{each of which}} describes a way <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> God in human terms. The via negativa {{is a way of}} referring to God according to what God is not; analogy uses human qualities as standards against which to compare divine qualities; symbolism is used non-literally to describe otherwise ineffable experiences; and a mythological interpretation of religion attempts to reveal fundamental truths behind religious stories. Alternative explanations of religious language cast it as having political, performative, or imperative functions.|$|E

It is now however becoming recognized that processes of identity formation and social stratification in regards to all population groups in Mexico can be analyzed both in terms of race and of ethnicity.|$|E

It made sense because it opened up for us a way <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> an actual poem in an actual classroom, and because the technique of focusing upon a poem as language rather than as history or biography or morality, gave a whole new meaning to and justification for the teaching of poetry (qtd. in Singh 1991).|$|E

500|$|A {{modified}} and fictionalized {{account of}} the Baird nomination formed the core of Wendy Wasserstein's 1996 play An American Daughter, which was later made into a 2000 television film. [...] Wasserstein saw the episode, {{as well as what}} happened to Wood, as an example of double standards and sexism, and used it as a vehicle to explore the nature and status of American feminism as of the 1990s. [...] She said of its role in illustrating feminist issues, [...] "I mean, if Nannygate hadn't existed, what a great thing to make up as a way <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> it." [...] An American Daughter became one of Wasserstein's most ambitious works, and also her most political.|$|E

[...] After extensive media coverage of his earnings, PewDiePie posted a video, expressing his frustration at the extensive media coverage over his income. In the video he claimed, [...] "We did raise a million dollars for charity, and very few articles picked up on that, but here it is everywhere how much money I make", adding, [...] "It seems like the whole world cares more {{about how much money}} I make than I do myself."

500|$|... "The Silence" [...] {{is a song}} by British singer Alexandra Burke {{from her}} debut studio album Overcome (2009).

The song was released as a promotional single {{in anticipation of the}} re-release of Overcome (2010). Burke stated that the song was written when her aunt told the singer about how she and her partner were experiencing troubles in their relationship, and that they were not telling each other how they felt. In response, Burke asked her aunt why he was letting the silence in their relationship do the talking instead of them discussing it. [...] "The Silence" [...] is an R and pop-influenced power ballad and instrumentation consists of a piano, a guitar and drums. The lyrics of the song feature the protagonist asking why the other person in the relationship remains silent about their difficulties instead <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> them.|$|E

In 1864, he joined his parents on stage in their music hall act, and {{he made his first}} solo appearance, aged nine, at the Britannia Music Hall in Coventry. [...] As a youth, he was famous for his clog dancing, and in his teen years, he became the star of his family's act. [...] He adopted the stage name Dan Leno and, in 1884, made his first performance under that name in London. [...] As a solo artist, he became increasingly popular during the late 1880s and 1890s, when {{he was one of the}} highest-paid comedians in the world. [...] He developed a music hall act <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> life's mundane subjects, mixed with comic songs and surreal observations, and created a host of mostly working-class characters to illustrate his stories. In 1901, still at the peak of his career, he performed his [...] "Huntsman" [...] sketch for Edward VII at Sandringham. The monarch was so impressed that Leno became publicly known as [...] "the king's jester".|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single [...] "Aruku Around" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by music critics. CDJournal reviewers gave the single its star of recommendation, {{calling it a}} [...] "killer tune" [...] where the [...] "pleasure {{of living in the}} moment" [...] and [...] "prudence" [...] is balanced. They noted the song's retro sound, like nostalgic dance music, and felt that the band's decision to move to Tokyo two years ago was reflected in the song. Kenji Sasaki of Skream! felt that the song had a [...] "gentle electronica feel", praising the 1980s-style synths, aggressive sound and [...] "unique poetic sentiment" [...] of Yamaguchi's. He also praised the emotions the song gave him, mixing pain and exhilaration. Tomoki Takahashi of Rockin' On Japan felt the greatest strength of the song was how its lyrical content jarred with its [...] "high-spirited words" [...] and [...] "explosive hybrid beat". He noted that instead <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> the pleasures of the dance floor, Yamaguchi's lyrics were introspective, discussing loneliness, pain and longing. Takahashi praised the brave fanfare-like synth based leading melody, and the [...] "tight" [...] and [...] "earth-shaking" [...] four on the floor beat.|$|E
500|$|Mariano Moreno and Cornelio Saavedra had {{disagreements}} {{about the}} events of the May Revolution and the way to run the government; their disputes became public shortly after the creation of the Junta. Saavedra was the president, and Moreno was a secretary with the support of other vocal members. Ignacio Núñez describes how Morenists felt that the President was attempting to restore in his office the authority of the viceroys, thus downgrading the importance of {{the other members of the}} Junta at public events; while Saavedrists considered that the Secretary was overstepping his authority and did not allow even the appointment of a janitor that was not of his liking. However, Domingo Matheu would clarify in his memoirs that their initial concerns with Saavedra were based more on his desire for honours and privileges than for a real power struggle. Núñez described how Moreno was resisted by some criollos who initially supported the revolution without being aware of the long-term consequences. He was resisted by criollos alarmed by his straightforward way <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> concepts like self-determination, tyranny, slavery, and freedom. Theologians resented that Moreno cited authors like Rousseau, Voltaire, or Montesquieu rather than Christian philosophers like Saint Augustine or Saint Thomas. He was also resisted by conservative lawyers and by most of the [...] military.|$|E

500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Dig My Grave" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} by Parry Gettelman of the Orlando Sentinel as [...] "an angry, fuzzed-out rocker". The vocals for the track were recorded through a guitar fuzz-box in order to distort them. [...] "I Palindrome I", is the final single that was released to promote Apollo 18. [...] The circular nature of the song's lyrical themes is reinforced by its title and use of palindromes. In fact, the song is notable for featuring a word-by-word palindrome in one of the verses: [...] "'Son, I am able', she said, 'though you scare me.' 'Watch', said I. 'Beloved", I said, 'watch me scare you, though.' Said she, 'Able am I, son.'" [...] "She's Actual Size" [...] was written by Flansburgh after he contemplated the imagery of someone viewing a departing person in a mirror; he felt that the symbolism was a [...] "really succinct way <b>of</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> leaving somebody behind". The band later expressed disappointment with the [...] "definitive" [...] version featured on this album, largely because the song continued to develop as the band played it live. Flansburgh called the album version [...] "timid" [...] and noted that [...] "later performance versions of [...] have so much more spirit than the recorded version." [...] Although Linnell and Flansburgh usually write songs individually, [...] "My Evil Twin" [...] was an example of the two collaborating. Linnell wrote the musical structure of the song, rendering it as a MIDI file, and Flansburgh then wrote the melody and the lyrics. [...] "Mammal" [...] discusses various members of the titular vertebrate class, and, according to Linnell, poetically explores the fact that all mammals have hair {{at some point in their}} lifespan. According to Linnell, most of the scientific information in the song was gathered from an encyclopedia.|$|E
