40|$|The {{purpose of}} this review is to {{identify}} and summarise qualitative research focusing on the subjective experience <b>of</b> <b>worry.</b> The majority <b>of</b> research to date has focussed on quantitative measures <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> which limit participants’ responses to ratings on pre-defined questionnaire items. In summarising open ended subjective studies about the experience <b>of</b> <b>worry,</b> this review aims to identify phenomenological aspects of the experience <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> that may further advance theory development. Findings are summarised. The following key qualitative themes were identified, a) control over worry, b) value assessments <b>of</b> <b>worry,</b> c) perceived causes <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> and d) cognitive features <b>of</b> <b>worry.</b> However, all qualitative studies identified by the review were lacking in quality, transparency and/or richness.

40|$|Objectives. This study investigates <b>worrying</b> in mothers <b>of</b> {{adolescents}} with internalizing disorders, and tests {{the hypothesis that}} these mothers will produce a greater number <b>of</b> <b>worries</b> with higher catastrophic content compared to control groups. Design. Differences in worry steps and in catastrophic content <b>of</b> <b>worries</b> were investigated in a cross-sectional, between groups design, employing a clinical internalizing group, a clinical control, and a non-referred control group. Methods. Twenty-five mothers of {{adolescents with}} internalizing disorders, 24 mothers of adolescents with externalizing disorders, and 28 mothers with non-referred adolescents participated in two interviews about their ‘real’ pre-existing worries and their worries {{in response to a}} hypothetical situation. Results. The internalizing group produced both a greater number <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> steps and a higher catastrophic content when they talked about their ‘real’ worries, compared to both control groups. They also produced a greater number <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> steps in response to a hypothetical situation compared to the other two groups. The number <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> steps and the level of catastrophic content <b>of</b> ‘real’ <b>worries</b> were associated with adolescent depression and anxiety. Additionally, the number <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> steps and the level of catastrophic content <b>of</b> <b>worries</b> in response to a hypothetical situation were related to adolescent depression. The number <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> steps in ‘real’ worries and the level of catastrophic content in hypothetical worries were also associated with maternal depressive symptoms. Conclusions.

Disease-related worry can help disease prevention and management, but can also have a detrimental effect. This study measured the overall level <b>of</b> disease-related <b>worry</b> during the MERS outbreak period in Korea and the influencing factors and levels <b>of</b> disease-related <b>worry</b> during key outbreak periods. The cross-sectional survey included 1, 000 adults who resided in Korea. An ordinal logistic regression was performed for the overall level <b>of</b> MERS-related <b>worry,</b> and influencing factors <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> were analyzed. A reliability test {{was performed on the}} levels <b>of</b> MERS-related <b>worry</b> during key outbreak periods. The overall level <b>of</b> MERS-related <b>worry</b> was 2. 44. Multivariate analysis revealed that women and respondents w very poor subjective health status had higher levels <b>of</b> <b>worry.</b> Respondents with very high stress in daily life had higher levels <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> than those who reported having little stress. The reliability test results on MERS-related worry scores during key outbreak periods showed consistent scores during each period. Level <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> increased in cases having higher perceived susceptibility and greater trust in informal information, while initial stage of outbreak was closely associated with that at later stages. These findings suggest the importance of managing the level <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> by providing timely and accurate disease-related information during the initial stage of disease outbreak...|$|R

Nonetheless, such explanations continue to be sought and two approaches have dominated explanations of the mystery of the green children. The first is that the narrative descends from folklore, describing an imaginary encounter with the inhabitants of a [...] "fairy Otherworld". In a few early as well as modern readings, this other world is extraterrestrial, and the green children alien beings.

His study of accounts of children and servants fleeing from their masters led Charles Oman to conclude that [...] "there is clearly some mystery behind it all , some story of drugging and kidnapping".

Established to boost the air defence {{capability}} of Australia's North-Western Area, the wing comprised three Supermarine Spitfire squadrons that had been transferred from Europe: No.54 Squadron RAF, No.452 Squadron RAAF and No.457 Squadron RAAF. With Wing Commander Clive Caldwell, Australia's top-scoring flying ace of the war, as his wing leader, Walters began deploying aircraft and men to Darwin, Northern Territory, in December, providing a filip for morale in the region. Proudly declaring himself Australia's oldest fighter pilot, Walters was reported as taking every opportunity to join his men in the air. He flew as Caldwell's wingman in No.1 Wing's first major action against the Japanese over Darwin on 2May 1943. [...] Eight Spitfires crashed and several others made forced landings, {{for the destruction of}} one Japanese bomber and five fighters.

40|$|Objective: Worry is {{a common}} and {{distressing}} problem in Parkinson’s disease(PD). However, {{little is known about}} the nature and content <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> in PD and how it might differ to non-PD populations. The study aimed to explore the content and nature <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> in middle and older aged adults with and without PD. Method: 4 groups of participants: 20 PD patients(10 high worry, 10 low worry) 19 middle and older aged adults(10 high worry, 9 low worry) completed the Catastrophising Interview(CI) for three worry topics. Worriers were classified(high/low) based on Penn State Worry Questionnaire scores. Data were analysed using Framework Analysis. Results: High worriers showed a greater diversity <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> topics than low worriers. Health worries differentiated high and low worriers in the non-PD sample but were common across all PD participants. The CI revealed that the root concern <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> was often different to that initially described. In particular, PD high worriers were more likely to express underlying concerns about negative self-perception and death/severe incapacity. Conclusion: The CI was able to identify the root cause <b>of</b> <b>worry,</b> demonstrating the value of this technique in the exploration and treatment <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> and psychological distress. Exploring worry content may help to distinguish patients with problematic worry, with worries about self-perception and death/severe incapacity characteristic of high worriers.

40|$|Background: Parental overprotection {{may have}} a direct effect on worry through {{hindering}} children's exploration experiences and preventing the learning of action-oriented coping strategies (Cheron, Ehrenreich and Pincus, 2009; Nolen-Hoeksema, Wolfson, Mumme and Guskin, 1995) and an indirect effect through fostering the development of maladaptive metacognitions {{that are associated with}} the activation <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> and the escalation of anxiety (Wells, 2000). Aim: The aim was to investigate the relative contribution of recalled parental overprotection in childhood and metacognitions in predicting current levels <b>of</b> <b>worry.</b> Method: A community sample (n = 301) was administered four self-report instruments to assess parental overprotection, metacognitions, anxiety and worry. Results: Metacognitions were found to predict levels <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> independently <b>of</b> gender, anxiety and parental overprotection.

The first objective {{of this study was}} to provide additional empirical support for the mood-as-input model <b>of</b> perseverative <b>worrying.</b> A second objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the association between perseverative worry and GAD symptoms. The final objective of this study was to assist in generating a comprehensive model <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> that incorporated unique predictors of GAD. Results indicated that unique variables, such as ‘as many as can’ stop rules and beliefs about worry, were weak predictors of perseveration, but were significant predictors <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> and GAD symptoms. Therefore, these variables may still contribute to the processes inherent in perseverative worry. Results also indicated that the catastrophic interview was an overall weak predictor <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> and GAD symptoms, suggesting that the catastrophic interview might not be the most suitable measure <b>of</b> perseverative <b>worry.</b> In summary, the current study provides mixed support for the mood-as-input model <b>of</b> perseverative <b>worrying.</b> Future research should further examine the relationship of the catastrophic interview and perseverative worry.

2500|$|In his 1958 article Tobin {{also led}} the way in showing how to deal with utility {{maximization}} under uncertainty with an infinite number of possible states. As Palda explains [...] "One {{way to get out of}} the mess of figuring out asset prices using a model of maximizing the expected utility of investing in stocks is to make assumptions about either preferences or the probabilities of the different possible states of the world. Nobellist James Tobin (1958) took this line and discovered that in some cases you do not need to worry about the utility of income in thousands of states, and the attached probabilities, to solve the consumer’s choice on how to spread income among states. When preferences contain only a linear and a squared term (a case of diminishing returns) or the probabilities of different stock returns follow a normal distribution (an equation that contains a linear and squared terms as parameters), a simple formulation of a person’s investment choices becomes possible. Under Tobin’s assumptions we can reformulate the person’s decision problem as being one of trading off risk and expected return. Risk, or more precisely the variance of your investment portfolio creates spread in the returns you expect. People are willing to assume more risk only if compensated by a higher level of expected return. One can thus think of a tradeoff people are willing to make between risk and expected return. They invest in risky assets to the point at which their willingness to trade off risk and return is equal to the rate at which they able to trade them off. It is difficult to exaggerate how brilliant is the simplification of the investment problem that flows from these assumptions. Instead <b>of</b> <b>worrying</b> about the investor’s optimization problem in potentially millions of possible states of the world, one need only worry about how the investor can trade off risk and return in the stock market." ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that worry in individuals with Generalized Anxiety Disorder may be reinforced by a positive effect <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> on decision making, as reflected by a steeper learning curve on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). We hypothesized that this apparent positive effect <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> {{is dependent on the}} IGT parameters, in particular the absence of an opportunity to avoid decisions. OBJECTIVE: (1) To replicate previous findings on the effect <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> on IGT performance. (2) To examine the influence of avoidance opportunity on IGT performance. We hypothesized that the positive effect <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> on learning would be abolished or reversed by the opportunity to avoid. METHOD: A standard IGT and a new IGT version that includes a pass (avoidance) option were completed by 78 and 79 participants, respectively. RESULTS: A beneficial effect <b>of</b> <b>worry</b> on learning in the standard version of the IGT was not observed. In the pass version <b>of</b> the IGT, <b>worry</b> status and avoidance were negatively associated with performance. Worry was not related, however, to pass usage. The hypothesized mediating effect of avoidance was non-significant. LIMITATIONS: It is unclear to what extent these findings generalize to real-life decision making and how clinical status affects results. CONCLUSION: The possibility to avoid a decision results in poorer IGT performance in high relative to low trait worriers. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed...|$|R
