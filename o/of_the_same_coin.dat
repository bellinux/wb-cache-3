25|$|In {{his book}} , Mamdani claims {{the two types}} of rule were each sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> He {{explains}} that colonialists did not exclusively use one system of rule over another. Instead, European powers divided regions along urban-rural lines and instituted separate systems of government in each area. Mamdani refers to the formal division of rural and urban natives by colonizers as the “bifurcated state.” Urban areas were ruled directly by the colonizers under an imported system of European law, which did not recognize the validity of native institutions. In contrast, rural populations were ruled indirectly by customary and traditional law and were therefore subordinate to the “civilized” urban citizenry. Rural inhabitants were viewed as “uncivilized” subjects and were deemed unfit to receive the benefits of citizenship. The rural subjects, Mamdani observed, had only a “modicum of civil rights,” and were entirely excluded from all political rights.|$|E

500|$|In {{her efforts}} to vividly {{describe}} the condition of women within society, Wollstonecraft employs several different analogies. She often compares women to slaves, arguing that their ignorance and powerlessness places them in that position. But at the same time, she also compares them to [...] "capricious tyrants" [...] who use cunning and deceit to manipulate the men around them. At one point, she reasons that a woman can become either a slave or tyrant, which she describes as two sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> Wollstonecraft also compares women to soldiers; like military men, they are valued only for their appearance. And like the rich, women's [...] "softness" [...] has [...] "debased mankind".|$|E

[...] The final reason, he attributed to the critics, believing that the fusion of horror and teen comedy confused some of them. He mentioned Ty Burr's review in particular, and stated that the film could perhaps have used more horror and been funnier, but that the film is [...] "ultimately a movie about two teenage girls' misadventures in victimization" [...] and that [...] "he jokes are virtually incidental to the friction imposed on women who happen to be two sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> Who's the monster, and who made the monster?

2500|$|Schopenhauer's {{identification}} of the Kantian noumenon (i.e., the actually existing entity) with what he termed [...] "will" [...] deserves some explanation. The noumenon was what Kant called the Ding an sich (the Thing in Itself), the reality that {{is the foundation of}} our sensory and mental representations of an external world. In Kantian terms, those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena. Schopenhauer departed from Kant in his description {{of the relationship between the}} phenomenon and the noumenon. According to Kant, things-in-themselves ground the phenomenal representations in our minds; Schopenhauer, on the other hand, believed that phenomena and noumena are two different sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> Noumena do not cause phenomena, but rather phenomena are simply the way by which our minds perceive the noumena, according to the principle of sufficient reason. This is explained more fully in Schopenhauer's doctoral thesis, On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason (1813).|$|E

50|$|After the {{introduction}} in <b>the</b> United Kingdom <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gold Standard Act 1925, which established a new procedure for buy-sell operations with gold, the gold coins issued after 1914 {{ceased to be}} accepted by <b>the</b> Bank <b>of</b> England. As a result, interest in the Soviet chervonets in Europe fell sharply. To obtain much-needed foreign currency, the Soviet Government decided to strike 10 ruble coins in the pre-revolutionary design, bearing <b>the</b> portrait <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murdered tsar Nicholas II. These coins were accepted without problems. 600,000 gold 10 ruble coins were struck in 1925 from the old dies which had survived the 1917 Revolution and the subsequent civil war. These coins were dated 1911. The following year, 1926, the government minted a further 1,411,000 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coins,</b> as well as 1,000,000 gold 5 ruble coins dated 1898 on the reverse and again with <b>the</b> portrait <b>of</b> Nicolas II on the obverse. <b>The</b> transition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> European currency system in <b>the</b> second half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1920s to a gold bullion standard led to a minimum volume requirement of 400 troy ounces for inter-bank gold deals.

The board also decided that players from the different teams had to contribute an initial membership fee of $1 Argentine pesos, plus a monthly $0.50 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> In that year, Vélez rented a terrain in the neighbourhood of Mataderos known as Quinta de Figallo, located in the Tapalqué street, between Escalada and Chascomús streets.

The club's stay in Mataderos was short however, as they moved again in 1914, this time to the neighbourhood of Villa Luro. There, they bought a terrain between the streets of Bacacay, Víctor Hugo and Cortina, and the Maldonado Stream (parallel to what today is the Gaona avenue).|$|E
2500|$|Sumner was {{a friend}} of Samuel Gridley Howe and a guiding force for the American Freedmen's Inquiry Commission, started in 1863. He {{was one of the most}} {{prominent}} advocates for suffrage for blacks, along with free homesteads and free public schools. His uncompromising attitude did not endear him to moderates and his arrogance and inflexibility often inhibited his effectiveness as a legislator. [...] He was largely excluded from work on the Thirteenth Amendment, in part because he did not get along with Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee and did much of the work on it. Sumner introduced an alternative amendment that combined the Thirteenth Amendment with elements of the Fourteenth Amendment. It would have abolished slavery and declared that [...] "all people are equal before the law." [...] During Reconstruction, he often attacked civil rights legislation as inadequate and fought for legislation to give land to freed slaves and to mandate education for all, regardless of race, in the South. [...] He viewed segregation and slavery as two sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> He introduced a civil rights bill in 1872 to mandate equal accommodation in all public places and required suits brought under the bill to be argued in the federal courts.

2500|$|In South-East and East Asia, Maudgalyāyana is {{honored as}} a symbol of filial piety and psychic powers. Maudgalyāyana has had an {{important}} role in many Mahāyāna traditions. The Ullambana Sutra is the main Mahāyāna sūtra in which Maudgalyāyana's rescue of his mother is described. [...] The sutra was highly influential, judging from the more than sixty commentaries that were written about it. Although the original Sankrit sutra already encouraged filial piety, later Chinese accounts inspired by the sutra emphasized this even more. Furthermore, Chinese accounts described merit-making practices and filial piety as two inseparable sides <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin.</b> The sūtra became popular in China, Japan, and Korea, and led to the Yulanhui (China) and Obon (Japan) festivals. This festival probably spread from China to Japan in the seventh century, and similar festivals have been observed in India (Avalamba), Laos and Vietnam. The festival is celebrated on the seventh lunar month (China; originally only on the full moon, on the Pravāraṇa Day), [...] or from 13 to 15 July (Japan). It is believed that in this period ancestors reborn as pretas or hungry ghosts wander around. In China, this was the time when the yearly varṣa for monastics came to an end (normally translated as rains retreat, but in China this was a Summer Retreat). It was a time that the monastics completed their studies and meditation, which was celebrated. Up until the present day, people make merits and transfer merit through several ceremonies during the festival, so the spirits may be reborn in a better rebirth. The festival is also popular among non-Buddhists, and has led Taoists to integrate it in their own funeral services.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{majority}} of the Doctor's companions are young, attractive females, the production team for the 1963–89 series maintained a long-standing taboo against any overt romantic involvement in the TARDIS: for example, Peter Davison, as the Fifth Doctor, was not allowed to put his arm around either Sarah Sutton (Nyssa) or Janet Fielding (Tegan Jovanka). However, that has not prevented fans from speculating about possible romantic involvements, most notably between the Fourth Doctor and the Time Lady Romana (whose actors, Tom Baker and Lalla Ward, shared a romance and brief marriage). The taboo was controversially broken in the 1996 television movie when the Eighth Doctor was shown kissing companion Grace Holloway. The 2005 series played with this idea by having various characters think that the Ninth Doctor and Rose Tyler were a couple, which they vehemently denied. Since the series revival, the Doctor has kissed many of his companions, including Rose and Jack, although each instance was not necessarily in a romantic context (see also [...] "The Doctor and romance"). Donna Noble vehemently denied a sexual interest in the Doctor when he invited her to join him and explained, [...] "I just want a mate," [...] which she misheard as [...] "I just want to mate." [...] Rose and Martha each developed romantic feelings toward the Doctor. On the opposite side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>coin,</b> Amy reacted to the stress of her adventures by very aggressively trying to seduce the Doctor on the eve of her own wedding, despite being in love with her fiancé Rory; the Doctor forcibly pushed her off of himself, though she did not immediately cease her pursuit. The Eleventh Doctor romantically kissed Amy and Rory's daughter, sporadic companion River Song, jokingly proposed marriage to her, and soon married her.|$|E
