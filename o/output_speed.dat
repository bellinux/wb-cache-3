While each of the nine processing cores can sustain 25.6GB/s read and write concurrently, the memory interface controller (MIC) is tied {{to a pair of}} XDR memory channels permitting a maximum flow of 25.6GB/s for reads and writes combined and the two IO controllers are documented as supporting a peak combined input speed of 25.6GB/s and a peak combined <b>output</b> <b>speed</b> of 35GB/s.|$|E
25|$|The triple {{differential}} is {{a modification}} to the double differential, replacing the steering clutches {{with a single}} braked differential similar to controlled differential. This third differential produces any desired <b>output</b> <b>speed</b> in the steering shaft, compared to the double differential where {{the speed of the}} shaft is fixed. This output drives the steering idlers of an otherwise unchanged double differential, producing continuously variable steering. It has all the advantages of the double differential, with the only disadvantage is that the brake on the third differential dissipates some energy while slipping, but this is dependent only on the amount of energy being used to steer the vehicle, not the total energy being delivered to the tracks.|$|E
40|$|Many Virtual Environments require walking {{interfaces}} {{to explore}} virtual worlds {{much larger than}} available real-world tracked space. We present a model for generating virtual locomotion speeds from Walking-In-Place (WIP) inputs based on walking biomechanics. By employing gait principles, our model – called Gait-Understanding-Driven Walking-In-Place (GUD WIP) – creates <b>output</b> <b>speeds</b> which better match those evident in Real Walking, and which better respond to variations in step frequency, including realistic starting and stopping. The <b>speeds</b> <b>output</b> by our implementation demonstrate considerably less within-step fluctuation than a good current WIP system – Low-Latency, Continuous-Motion (LLCM) WIP – while still remaining responsive to changes in user input. We compared resulting speeds from Real Walking, GUD WIP, and LLCM-WIP via user study: The average <b>output</b> <b>speeds</b> for Real Walking and GUD WIP respond consistently with changing step frequency – LLCM-WIP is far less consistent. GUD WIP produces <b>output</b> <b>speeds</b> that are more locally consistent (smooth) and stepfrequency-to-walk-speed consistent than LLCM-WIP...|$|R

It may also mean the torque load that causes the <b>output</b> rotational <b>speed</b> of a device to become zero, i.e., to cause stalling. Electric motors, steam engines and hydrodynamic transmissions are all capable of developing torque when stalled.|$|R

The [...] "exchange button", used to launch opponents {{into the air and}} switch between characters while performing air combos, returns. The aerial exchange feature has been altered in Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3; players can either remove meter from their opponent's Hyper Combo gauge, add meter to their own gauge, or simply deal more damage. The [...] "X-Factor" [...] mechanic, which grants increased damage <b>output,</b> <b>speed,</b> and health regeneration for a limited time, also reappears from Fate of Two Worlds. In Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, the attack and speed boosts for each character while using X-Factor have been adjusted. X-Factor can now be used while in the air, as opposed to the previous game, in which activation was restricted to characters on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cantilever}} {{wing of the}} Bee was of novel construction, built around a wide box formed from four spanwise spruce members connected with ply, constant in chord but tapering in thickness. [...] Aerofoil shaped ribs were then slipped around the box and fabric covered. The wings had almost constant chord, tapering in plan only slightly and carrying long ailerons. A 40hp (30kW) four-cylinder water-cooled Carden-Ford engine lay buried in each wing immediately behind the box spar, driving a small two-bladed propeller via a gearbox, which increased the <b>output</b> <b>speed</b> by 10%, and a shaft to the trailing edge. These shafts were horizontal in flight, and so emerged above the wing surface on the way rearwards, contained in a shallow cowling. Radiators were mounted inside the wing, next to the engine, the cooling air ducted from under {{the front of the}} wing and exited via slots {{in the rear of the}} cowling. Fuel was stored in leading-edge tanks.|$|E
5000|$|Many typical {{automobile}} transmissions {{include the}} ability to select one of several gear ratios. In this case, most of the gear ratios (often simply called [...] "gears") are used {{to slow down the}} <b>output</b> <b>speed</b> of the engine and increase torque. However, the highest gears may be [...] "overdrive" [...] types that increase the <b>output</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
30|$|Torque {{converters}} are {{an important}} part of automatic transmissions in automobiles and other vehicles. It provides automatic torque amplification according to the different rotational speed between the input and <b>output</b> <b>speeds</b> without any active control, inherently suppressing engine torque fluctuations. Because it significantly affects the fuel economy, launch feeling and drivability, interests in the development of a high efficiency and performance have been increased recently.|$|R

40|$|A novel geared {{infinitely}} variable transmission (IVT) that can generate a continuous output-to-input speed ratio from zero to a certain value is developed and analyzed. The principle of changing the output-to-input speed ratio {{is to use a}} crank-slider mechanism; the output-to-input speed ratio is controlled by adjusting the crank length. Since the crank-slider mechanism can lead to relatively large variation of the output-to-input speed ratio in one rotation of the crank, the instantaneous input and <b>output</b> <b>speeds</b> and accelerations have variations and the corresponding forces exerted on each part of the IVT can have obvious changes in one rotation of the crank. Since forces on some parts of the IVT are critical and can cause failure of the IVT for vehicle and wind turbine applications, a dynamic analysis of the IVT is necessary to simulate the input and <b>output</b> <b>speeds</b> and accelerations. A method that combines Lagrangian dynamics and Newtonian dynamics is developed here to analyze the motion of the IVT. The dynamic analysis results can be used to evaluate the current design of the IVT...|$|R

5000|$|A {{subset of}} CVT designs are called {{infinitely}} variable transmissions (IVT or IVTs), {{in which the}} range of ratios of output shaft speed to input shaft speed includes a zero ratio that can be continuously approached from a defined [...] "higher" [...] ratio. A zero <b>output</b> <b>speed</b> (low gear) with a finite input speed implies an infinite input-to-output speed ratio, which can be continuously approached from a given finite input value with an IVT. Low gears are a reference to low ratios of <b>output</b> <b>speed</b> to input speed. This low ratio is taken to the extreme with IVTs, resulting in a [...] "neutral", or non-driving [...] "low" [...] gear limit, in which the <b>output</b> <b>speed</b> is zero. Unlike neutral in a normal automotive transmission, IVT output rotation may be prevented because the back-driving (reverse IVT operation) ratio may be infinite, resulting in impossibly high backdriving torque; in a ratcheting IVT, however, the output may freely rotate in the forward direction.|$|E

50|$|A {{belt-driven}} design offers approximately 88% efficiency, which, while {{lower than}} that of a manual transmission, can be offset by lower production cost and by enabling the engine to run at its most efficient speed for a range of <b>output</b> <b>speeds.</b> When power is more important than economy, the ratio of the CVT can be changed to allow the engine to turn at the RPM at which it produces greatest power. This is typically higher than the RPM that achieves peak efficiency. In low-mass low-torque applications (such as motor scooters) a belt-driven CVT also offers ease of use and mechanical simplicity.|$|R

Because the wind turbine system has multiple inputs (pitch angle, field vollage alld delay angle), and multiple <b>outputs,</b> (<b>speed</b> and power), and because the requirements conflict, the linear quadratic optimal control method/or mullivariable systems is used. Two optimal proportional-integral controllers are applied to a delailed non-linear dynamic model. With simulations it is shown that, even when a large gust occurs, the speed and power fluctuations are very small. With an eigenvalue analysis it is shown that the torsional oscillations in the shaft are well damped...|$|R
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines found in passenger automobiles {{are able to}} operate over a relatively wide range of speeds. A close-ratio type of transmission is designed to allow an engine to remain in a relatively narrow operating speed. Alternately, a wide-ratio transmission requires the engine to operate over a greater speed range, but requires less shifting and allows {{a wider range of}} <b>output</b> <b>speeds.</b> Close-ratio transmissions are generally offered in sports cars, in which the engine is tuned for maximum power in a narrow range of operating speeds and the driver can be expected to enjoy shifting often to keep the engine in its power band.|$|R

50|$|Eddy current drives are slip-controlled systems {{the slip}} energy {{of which is}} {{necessarily}} all dissipated as heat. Such drives are therefore generally less efficient than AC/DC-AC conversion based drives. The motor develops the torque required by the load and operates at full speed. The output shaft transmits the same torque to the load, but turns at a slower speed. Since power is proportional to torque multiplied by speed, the input power is proportional to motor speed times operating torque while the output power is <b>output</b> <b>speed</b> times operating torque. The difference between the motor speed and the <b>output</b> <b>speed</b> is called the slip speed. Power proportional to the slip speed times operating torque is dissipated as heat in the clutch.|$|E

Further, comparing the models with and without structural change demonstrates that the latter implies stronger environmental damages and, consequently, a lower growth rate than the first one. Finally, levying a tax on the polluting <b>output</b> <b>speeds</b> up structural change, thus, reducing environmental pollution and spurring economic growth.
