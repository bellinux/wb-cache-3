5|$|Lemoine's {{system of}} constructions, the Géométrographie, {{attempted}} {{to create a}} methodological system by which constructions could be judged. This system enabled a more direct process for simplifying existing constructions. In his description, he listed five main operations: placing a compass's end <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> point, placing it <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> line, drawing a circle with the compass placed upon the aforementioned point or line, placing a straightedge <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> line, and extending the line with the straightedge.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we generalize Majid's bicrossproduct construction. We {{start with}} a pair (A, B) of two regular {{multiplier}} Hopf algebras. We assume that B is a right A-module algebra and that A is a left B-comodule coalgebra. The right action of <b>A</b> <b>on</b> B <b>gives</b> rise to the smash product A # B. The left coaction of B <b>on</b> <b>A</b> <b>gives</b> <b>a</b> possible coproduct Delta(#) <b>on</b> <b>A</b> # B. We discuss in detail the necessary compatibility conditions between the action and the coaction for Delta(#) to be <b>a</b> proper coproduct <b>on</b> <b>A</b> # B. The result is again a regular multiplier Hopf algebra. Majid's construction is obtained when we have Hopf algebras. status: publishe...|$|R

It is usually possible to identify the style {{of more than one}} scribe used <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> manuscript, even when the manuscript is a shorter one. The text and illustrations were produced by different scribes; {{there are a number of}} Books where the text was completed but the illustrations were left empty.|$|E
5|$|Directional {{anisotropy}} {{refers to}} a difference in diffusion mechanism or rate in a particular direction <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> crystallographic plane. These differences may {{be a result of}} either anisotropy in the surface lattice (e.g. a rectangular lattice) or the presence of steps on a surface. One of the more dramatic examples of directional anisotropy is the diffusion of adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc (110), where diffusion along the channel is much faster than diffusion across the channel.|$|E
5|$|Grid {{computing}} is {{the most}} distributed form of parallel computing. It makes use of computers communicating over the Internet to work <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> problem. Because of the low bandwidth and extremely high latency available on the Internet, distributed computing typically deals only with embarrassingly parallel problems. Many distributed computing applications have been created, of which SETI@home and Folding@home are the best-known examples.|$|E

5|$|The carbon–fluorine bond, a {{component}} of all organofluorine compounds, is the strongest chemical bond in organic chemistry. Furthermore, this bond becomes shorter and stronger as more fluorine atoms {{are added to the}} same carbon <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> molecule. Because of this, fluoroalkanes {{are some of the most}} chemically stable organic compounds.|$|E
5|$|Each {{state was}} allowed to cast a single vote either for or against a {{proposal}} during the debates {{in accordance with the}} majority opinion of the state's delegates. Throughout the Convention, delegates would regularly come and go, with only 30–40 being present on a typical day. Consequently, if a state's delegates were equally divided in their views <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> proposal, or if too few of the state's delegates were in attendance to establish a quorum for the delegation when votes were being cast on a particular proposal, that state's delegation had essentially no effect on the outcome of the vote on the proposal. Thus, for example, after two of New York's three delegates abandoned the Convention in mid July with no intention of returning, New York was left unable to vote on any further proposals at the Convention, although Hamilton would continue to periodically attend and occasionally to speak during the debates.|$|E
5|$|Geometrical optics {{provides}} further matrix applications. In this approximative theory, {{the wave}} nature of light is neglected. The {{result is a}} model in which light rays are indeed geometrical rays. If the deflection of light rays by optical elements is small, the action of a lens or reflective element <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> light ray can be expressed as multiplication of a two-component vector with a two-by-two matrix called ray transfer matrix: the vector's components are the light ray's slope and its distance from the optical axis, while the matrix encodes {{the properties of the}} optical element. Actually, {{there are two kinds of}} matrices, viz. a refraction matrix describing the refraction at a lens surface, and a translation matrix, describing the translation of the plane of reference to the next refracting surface, where another refraction matrix applies.|$|E

25|$|Although various hemitonic pentatonic scales {{might be}} called minor, the term is most {{commonly}} applied to the relative minor pentatonic derived from the major pentatonic, using scale tones 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7 of the natural minor scale. It may also be considered a gapped blues scale. The C minor pentatonic is C, E-flat, F, G, B-flat. The A minor pentatonic, the relative minor of C, comprises the same tones as the C major pentatonic, starting <b>on</b> <b>A,</b> <b>giving</b> <b>A,</b> C, D, E, G. This minor pentatonic contains all three tones of an A minor triad.|$|R
5|$|MIGA offers {{insurance}} to cover five types of non-commercial risks: currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction; government expropriation; war, terrorism, and civil disturbance; breaches of contract; and the non-honoring of financial obligations. MIGA will cover investments such as equity, loans, shareholder loans, and shareholder loan guarantees. The agency may also insure investments such as management contracts, asset securitization, bonds, leasing activities, franchise agreements, and license agreements. The agency generally offers insurance coverage lasting up to 15 {{years with a}} possible five-year extension depending <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> project's nature and circumstances. When an event occurs that is protected by the insurance, MIGA can exercise the investor's rights against the host country through subrogation to recover expenses associated with covering the claim. However, the agency's convention does not require member governments to treat foreign investments in any special way. As a multilateral institution, MIGA is also {{in a position to}} attempt to sort out potential disputes before they ever turn into insurance claims.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next week, the US troops were able to discern the North Koreans' system of attack and use it to their advantage. The North Koreans used a system of flares to signal various actions and {{coordinate}} them. It quickly became apparent to the defending Americans that green flares were used to signal an attack <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> area. So the 27th Infantry obtained its own green flares and then, after the North Korean attack had begun, fired them over its main defensive positions. This confused the attacking forces and often drew them to the points of greatest US strength where they suffered massive casualties from defensive machine-gun crossfire. The US troops also began using land mines in front of their positions to stall the North Koreans. The mines stopped the tanks and the infantry tried to remove them. When this happened, US troops fired flares to illuminate the scene and pre-registered artillery and mortar fire blasted the immobilized North Koreans. This tactic was effective in inflicting further significant casualties.|$|E
5|$|Some of the translators {{hired to}} work on the books were {{well-known}} authors before their work on Harry Potter, such as Viktor Golyshev, who oversaw the Russian translation of the series' fifth book. The Turkish translation of books two to seven was undertaken by Sevin Okyay, a popular literary critic and cultural commentator. For reasons of secrecy, translation <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> book could only start after it had been released in English, leading to a lag of several months before the translations were available. This led to more and more copies of the English editions being sold to impatient fans in non-English speaking countries; for example, such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English language edition became the first English-language book ever to top the best-seller list in France.|$|E

Face Off challenges are score attack modes introduced in Guitar Hero II where two players attempt to gain the best score <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> song; in the standard Face Off challenge, the players may select different difficulty levels, while Pro Face Off requires the players {{to play at the}} same difficulty.|$|E
5|$|The electors {{were then}} told {{to break up}} the Convention and {{assemble}} into the formal Assembly or Council. The electors voted by placing a pebble or written ballot into an appropriate jar. The baskets that held the votes were watched by specific officers, who then counted the ballots, and reported the results to the presiding magistrate. The majority of votes in any Curia, Tribe, or Century decided how that Curia, Tribe, or Century voted. Each Curia, Tribe, or Century received one vote, regardless of how many electors each Tribe or Century held. Once a majority of Curiae, Tribes, or Centuries voted in the same way <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> measure, the voting ended, and the matter was decided.|$|E
5|$|The {{system of}} pre-defining the {{indicator}} {{setting for the}} day for all Enigma operators <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>given</b> network, on which the method of characteristics depended, was changed on 15 September 1938. The one exception to this was the network used by the Sicherheitsdienst (SD)—the intelligence agency of the SS and the Nazi Party—who {{did not make the}} change until 1 July 1939. Operators now chose their own indicator setting. However, the insecure procedure of sending the enciphered message key twice, remained in use, and it was quickly exploited. Henryk Zygalski devised a manual method that used 26 perforated sheets, and Marian Rejewski commissioned the AVA company to produce the bomba kryptologiczna (cryptologic bomb).|$|E
