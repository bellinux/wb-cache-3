5|$|By his own {{description}} of his early family life, Cody grew up poor. His mother worked two jobs, as a traveling nurse and a bus driver, to care {{for him and his}} seven younger siblings. His parents were not married, but his father, a construction worker, {{was a big part of}} his life until he died in a car accident when Cody was 11. At the end of his junior year of high school, Cody moved in with the family <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> school teammate.|$|E

5|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, the city's {{population}} had grown to 728, and social organizations began to establish themselves in Marysville, including a lodge of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows and a Crystal Lodge of the Free and Accepted Masons. The first city hall was opened in late 1901, at a cost of $2,000; the building also housed the city's fire department, and later the first public library in 1907. Electrical and water supply systems were both inaugurated in 1906, alongside the construction <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> school building.|$|E
5|$|Diverse {{geographic}} destinations and cabin pressurisation alike on the Comet {{demanded the}} use <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> proportion of alloys, plastics, {{and other materials}} new to civil aviation across the aircraft {{in order to meet}} certification requirements. The Comet's high cabin pressure and fast operating speeds were unprecedented in commercial aviation, making its fuselage design an experimental process. At its introduction, Comet airframes would be subjected to an intense, high-speed operating schedule which included simultaneous extreme heat from desert airfields and frosty cold from the kerosene-filled fuel tanks, still cold from cruising at high altitude.|$|E
5|$|Gopalam, the zamindar of Appapuram, is the {{principal}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> school named after his elder daughter Mahalakshmi. As a child, she went missing during a pilgrimage to the Godavari River pushkaram in Kakinada. Conditions at the school deteriorate due to mismanagement by Gopalam's nephew, A. K. Raju, an amateur detective. This is exacerbated when Panthulu, an ayurvedic doctor, teaches the children. Gopalam decides to replace them with a male and a female graduate (preferably a married couple) capable of training his younger daughter Sita in singing besides teaching children at the school.|$|E

The choice <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> muzzle velocity with a relatively lighter shell was taken from the German practice; it ran counter to previous British guns such as the BL 15-inch Mark I gun of 42-calibre length which were lower-muzzle-velocity weapons firing heavy shells.|$|E
5|$|In February 2007, a {{controversy}} arose after Brown's appearance at King Philip Regional High School in Wrentham, Massachusetts {{as part of}} a debate on gay marriage. The high school students had launched a Facebook group attack on Brown and had made a derogatory remark about his daughter, Ayla. During his presentation, Brown defended himself and his daughter by directly quoting several vulgar statements they had made and announcing the names of the students who had written the statements. Critics questioned whether Brown should have quoted the profane comments in front <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> school audience.|$|E

Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of High Kings stretching back thousands of years but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} {{moved to}} the east-northeast, and quickly strengthened into Tropical Storm Matthew. Operationally, Matthew fluctuated between tropical depression and tropical storm status, but in post-season analysis, the storm remained a tropical storm. The storm turned to the northeast while moving around the periphery <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> pressure system over Texas, and attained a peak intensity of 45mph (70km/h) on October 9. Strong wind shear limited further strengthening, and on October 10, Matthew struck Cocodrie, Louisiana as a minimal tropical storm. It became an extratropical cyclone, occluding near the time of landfall.|$|E
5|$|The high {{temperatures}} and dew points created moderate instability across the outbreak area. CAPE values, a {{measurement of the}} level of tropospheric instability, were over 1000J/kg, and helicity levels, a measurement of the potential for rotating winds, reached over 200m²/s².
