25|$|Vicarious trauma affects workers being 'witnesses' {{to their}} clients' trauma. It {{is more likely}} to occur in {{situations}} where trauma related work is the norm rather than the exception. Listening with empathy to the clients generates feeling, and 'seeing oneself' in clients' trauma may compound the risk for developing trauma symptoms. May also result if we are witness to situations that happen in the course <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>work</b> (e.g. violence in the workplace, reviewing violent video tapes, etc). Risk increases with exposure and with the absence of seeking protective factors and pre-preparation of preventive strategies.|$|E

Christgau also concedes that [...] "Because we are all self-taught (of necessity, since our academy is as yet informal), even the best <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>work</b> has the faults of autodidacticism: eccentricity, incompleteness, self-indulgence.

Yet I read on, as much from inclination as from duty, and find that a fair portion of what is bad, like some strains of 'bad' rock and roll, has the sloppy appeal of all open, democratic phenomena."

Of this reveal, Blizzard stated, [...] "as in real life, having variety in our characters and their identities and backgrounds helps create a richer and deeper overall fictional universe". About Tracer's development specifically, Blizzard stated, [...] "as with any aspect of our characters' backgrounds, their sexuality is just one part of what makes our heroes who they are.

He took eagle drawings from a book on animals in motion by Eadweard Muybridge. Pickford wanted {{to show off the}} possible graphical capabilities of the NES; he said, [...] "I wanted to do something 'flashy' early in the game, trying to show off my amazing graphic art skills on the rather primitive NES.

As part of the tour, U2 headlined the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In rationalising the tour, the Edge cited the 2016 US presidential election and other world events for what he judged to be renewed resonance of The Joshua Trees subject matter. He said that in looking at the record's anniversary, [...] "things have kind of come full circle, if you want. That record was written in the mid-Eighties, during the Reagan–Thatcher era of British and U.S. politics. It was a period when there was a lot of unrest.
