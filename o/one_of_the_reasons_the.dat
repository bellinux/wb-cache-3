5|$|At {{the start}} of the season, Wojtek Wolski was the Avalanche player seen as {{favorite}} to contend for the Calder Memorial Trophy; however, the scoring streak put Stastny into contention as well. Stastny's play was <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> Avalanche experienced their best run of the season towards the end, winning 15 of their last 19games but missing the playoffs by one point. Stastny ended his rookie season with 78points, finished second to Pittsburgh Penguins' Evgeni Malkin in the voting for the Calder Memorial Trophy and was named to the 2006–07 NHL All-Rookie Team.|$|E
5|$|Maureen Ryan {{believed}} that <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> episode {{worked so well}} was because it left out the storylines with the Night's Watch and the Dothraki and focused in a single location. VanDerWerff agreed, and added that with each episode the writers got bolder {{in the sense that}} they added new scenes not included in the book to round out the source material.|$|E
5|$|On land, young sea otters {{may face}} attack from bears and coyotes. In California, bites from sharks, {{particularly}} {{great white shark}}s, have been estimated to cause 10% of sea otter deaths and are <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> population has not expanded further north. The great white shark {{is believed to be}} their primary predator, and dead sea otters have been found with injuries from shark bites, although {{there is no evidence that}} sharks actually eat them.|$|E

5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> account's {{authenticity}} {{has been}} questioned {{is the fact that}} it claims St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law. Offler doubted that canon law had penetrated to England to any great degree in 1088. The historian Mark Philpott, however, argues that St-Calais was knowledgeable in canon law, since he owned a copy of one of the basis of canon law, the False Decretals. The bishop's manuscript of the Decretals still survives.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Operation Ten-Go is revered {{to some degree}} in modern Japan as {{evidenced}} by appearances of the story in popular Japanese culture which usually portray the event as a brave, selfless, but futile, symbolic effort by the participating Japanese sailors to defend their homeland. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> event may have such significance in Japanese culture is that the word Yamato was often used as a poetic name for Japan. Thus, the end of battleship Yamato {{could serve as a}} metaphor for the end of the Japanese empire.|$|E
5|$|Fundamental {{physical}} constants {{are often}} highly dependent upon each other. This {{implies that the}} best value of a fundamental physical constant, one with the least uncertainty, often can be determined by directly measuring other fundamental physical constants, from which the value can be calculated. The uncertainty in these constants is then determined from {{the uncertainty of the}} others by the propagation of uncertainty. Constants whose value is fixed, for determining the units in which they are expressed, don't have an uncertainty associated with them, so they do not account for any extra uncertainty {{in the value of the}} calculated constant. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> SI unit system will be changed is that determination of values can often be greatly improved if expressed in these new units. This is due to the dependence of these values on physical constants.|$|E

5|$|Harry Potter pundit John Granger {{additionally}} {{noted that}} <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> Harry Potter books were so popular is {{their use of}} literary alchemy (similar to Romeo and Juliet, C. S. Lewis's Perelandra and Charles Dickens's A Tale of Two Cities) and vision symbolism. In this model, authors weave allegorical tales along the alchemical magnum opus. Since the medieval period, alchemical allegory has mirrored the passion, death and resurrection of Christ. While the entire series utilises symbols common in alchemy, the Deathly Hallows completes this cycle, tying themes of death, rebirth, and the Resurrection Stone to the principal motif of alchemical allegory, and topics presented in the first book of the series.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> {{development}} team chose Tokyo as {{the main}} setting was that its turbulent history, going through multiple phases of development and often suffering severe damage in wars or due to natural disasters, made it comparable with the fantasy settings of other games at the time. In a later interview, an Atlus staff member stated that this setting and style made it the antithesis of traditional fantasy RPGs, adding that this resulted in the game developing a punk spirit. Because of the post-apocalyptic setting of Megami Tensei II, the development team wanted to depict a time before the apocalypse. The decision to set the game in Tokyo was made by Suzuki and Kaneko, and was influenced by manga such as Violence Jack, Devilman, and Fist of the North Star. Kichijōji was decided to be the game's starting point due to Kaneko, Suzuki, and Ito all having lived {{in or near the}} area, or having visited it often. The abandoned Terminal Echo building there fascinated them, making them wonder how a building in such a prime location could remain unoccupied; Ito described it as two floors of arcade cabinets, {{with the rest of the}} building feeling like a ghost town. This fascination led to it being included as a dungeon in the game. While designing the maps, Kaneko wanted to use wire-frame models, but the Super Famicom's limited capacities meant this idea was scrapped.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> party {{split from}} the SDF {{was over the}} issue of leadership. Since its {{establishment}} in 1904, the Socialist Party has existed without any leader. The Party has a ten-person executive committee, which is elected annually by a ballot of the whole membership and is charged with the day-to-day administration of the organisation. Its decision-making powers are tightly restricted. All substantial decisions are taken at the Annual Conference held each year at Easter.|$|E

Men, women and children are subject to labor exploitation in Thailand, China, Pakistan, South Korea and Macau. Children are trafficked in Thailand to be forced into begging, while young girls are trafficked into China to work in the sex slave industry.|$|E

25|$|Traction of the ICE1 {{trainsets}} {{is achieved}} by the eight driven axles of both power cars. Because relatively few axles have traction, the steepness of the grade the trains can safely negotiate are limited. The ICE1 is limited to grades of about 3.5%. Steeper grades cannot be negotiated safely, because the wheels could slip due to the low adhesion under adverse conditions, which {{may lead to a}} stopped train becoming stuck on a grade. This is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> ICE1 is not homologated for the Cologne-Frankfurt high-speed rail line, which has grades of up to 4%.|$|E
25|$|The {{working class}} Parisians {{and the poor}} were {{concentrated}} in the crowded maze of streets {{in the center of}} the city, on the Île de la Cité or close to the central market at Les Halles, and in the eastern neighborhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine (<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> nobility slowly moved to the Faubourg Saint-Germain), where thousands of small workshops and the furniture business were located, or on the Left Bank, near the Bièvre River, where the tanners and dyers were located. In the years just before the Revolution, these neighborhoods were flooded with thousands unskilled immigrants from the poorer regions of France. In 1789, these unemployed and hungry workers became the foot soldiers of the Revolution.|$|E
25|$|ABC, CBS and NBC are {{headquartered}} in New York City, {{which is the}} largest television market in the U.S., so their respective radio and television stations in that market are considered the overall network flagship stations. As programming schedules increased and modern technology improved transmission to affiliates, the networks set up operations centers in New York City (for the East Coast feed) and Los Angeles (for the West Coast feed). Los Angeles is the second largest television market in the U.S., and traditional home to the motion picture industry and its pool of popular talent, <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> radio networks set up operations there in the 1930s and 1940s (just as the medium of television was starting to take off).|$|E

The number of Internet users in the United States that visit online dating sites has fallen {{from a peak of}} 21% in 2003 to 10% in 2006. Whether it is the cost of the services, the variety of users with different intentions, or any other reason, it is undeniable that social networking sites are quickly becoming the new way to find dates online.|$|E
25|$|Passive {{immunity}} is {{also provided}} through colostrum and breast milk, which contain IgA antibodies that are {{transferred to the}} gut of the infant, providing local protection against disease causing bacteria and viruses until the newborn can synthesize its own antibodies. Maternal antibodies protect against some diseases more than others such as measles, rubella, and tetanus compared to the protection provided against polio, and pertussis. Maternal passive immunity offers immediate protection, though protection mediated by maternal IgG typically only lasting {{four to six months}} after birth. Protection mediated by IgA is dependent on the length of time that an infant is breastfed, which is <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding for at least {{the first two years of}} life.|$|E
25|$|<b>One</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>the</b> Saints {{had chosen}} the Great Basin as a {{settling}} place was that the area {{was at the time}} outside the territorial borders of the United States, which Young had blamed for failing to protect Mormons from political opposition from the states of Missouri and Illinois. However, in the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, Mexico ceded the area to the United States. As a result, Brigham Young sent emissaries to Washington, D.C. with a proposal to create a vast State of Deseret, of which Young would naturally be the first governor. Instead, Congress created the much smaller Utah Territory in 1850, and Young was appointed governor in 1851. Because of his religious position, Young exercised much more practical control over the affairs of Mormon and non-Mormon settlers than a typical territorial governor of the time.|$|E
