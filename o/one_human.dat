5|$|Demons can {{be talked}} with in battle and {{recruited}} {{if the right}} conversation is initiated. Once {{a part of the}} player's party, they will fight alongside them. In addition to standard demons, the player can ally with <b>one</b> <b>human</b> companion, with three being available on the first playthrough and a fourth unlocking during the second. When the player or their human partner dies in battle, they are granted a Guardian Spirit, who revives them at the last save point and teaches them new skills and alter the player's stats. The Guardian's specialties affect how stats are changed: a higher power ranking will raise the player's strength, but lower magic will decrease their Magic Point meter. The Guardian changes each time the player dies.|$|E
5|$|Descent: FreeSpace – The Great War, {{also known}} as Conflict: FreeSpace – The Great War in Europe, is a 1998 space combat {{simulation}} IBM PC compatible computer game developed by Volition, when it was split off from Parallax Software, and published by Interplay Productions. In 2001, it was ported to the Amiga platform as FreeSpace: The Great War by Hyperion Entertainment. The game places players {{in the role of}} a human pilot, who operates in several classes of starfighter and combats against opposing forces, either human or alien, in various space-faring environments, such as in orbit above a planet or within an asteroid belt. The story of the game's single player campaign focuses on a war in the 24th century between two factions, <b>one</b> <b>human</b> and the other alien, that is interrupted in its fourteenth year by the arrival of an enigmatic and militant alien race, whose genocidal advance forces the two sides into a ceasefire in order to work together to halt the threat.|$|E
5|$|The third {{multiplayer}} mode is the Combat Simulator, involving {{up to four}} human {{players and}} eight computer-controlled players. Again, a split-screen is used if more than <b>one</b> <b>human</b> is playing. If three or four humans play, the screen is divided into quarters, with one quarter left blank if necessary. Players enter the game unarmed and {{with a certain amount}} of health. Weapons and ammunition are placed around the level in preset positions. Once a player is killed, they are regenerated elsewhere in the level, once again unarmed. The overall objective of the game is determined by the scenario being played. Scenarios range from the traditional deathmatch mode, where players score points by killing their respective enemies, to objective-based games, such as Capture the Flag or King of the Hill. Other scenarios include Hold the Briefcase, where players must take a briefcase and survive with it for as long as possible, and Hacker Central, a gametype where players score points by hacking a computer system using a data uplink. Aspects of each game can be customised, including the chosen map, the weapons available, and the winning conditions. Players can also be grouped into teams or compete individually. In a team game, the players can optionally be shown coloured according to their team. Each game can be customised to a greater degree than was possible in GoldenEye 007s multiplayer mode, such as free weapons selection and placement of shields.|$|E

40|$|Status {{inconsistency}} is {{a situation}} in which there is an objective or subjective mismatch between, for example, a person’s education and his/her income. This mismatch may transform into status enhancement, wherein rewards exceed <b>one’s</b> <b>human</b> capital, or into status detraction, wherein <b>one’s</b> <b>human</b> capital exceeds <b>one’s</b> rewards. Although status inconsistency affects employees’ attitudes and behaviours, little is known about individual differences in this variable. The current study investigates whether the relationships of agreeableness and dominance—with objective and subjective status inconsistency vary by gender. We analysed objective and subjective input and return statuses among a sample of 375 employees. We found that men who expressed a gender-non-congruent trait, namely agreeableness, experienced an objective backlash effect compared with dominant men, whereas women who expressed a gender-non-congruent trait, namely dominance, did not experience a backlash effect compared with agreeable women. In addition, our results show that agreeable employees, both men and women, perceive themselves as status-enhanced when in fact they are not. Finally, we show that objective status inconsistency mediates the relationships of agreeableness and dominance with subjective status inconsistency...|$|R

25|$|The Babylonians {{identified}} Sagittarius as the god Nergal, {{a strange}} centaur-like creature firing an arrow from a bow. It is generally depicted with wings, with two heads, one panther head and <b>one</b> <b>human</b> head, {{as well as}} a scorpion's stinger raised above its more conventional horse's tail. The Sumerian name Pabilsag is composed of two elements– Pabil, meaning 'elder paternal kinsman' and Sag, meaning 'chief, head'. The name may thus be translated as the 'Forefather' or 'Chief Ancestor'. The figure is reminiscent of modern depictions of Sagittarius.|$|E

25|$|Human NAA15 {{is located}} on {{chromosome}} 4q31.1 and contains 23 exons. Initially, 2 mRNA species were identified, of size 4.6 and 5.8 kb, both harboring the same open reading frame encoding a putative protein of 866 amino acids (~105 kDa) protein that can be detected in most human adult tissues. According to RefSeq/NCBI, only <b>one</b> <b>human</b> transcript variant exists, although 2 more isoforms are predicted. In addition to full length Naa15, an N-terminally truncated variant of Naa15 (named tubedown-1), Naa15273-865 has been described; however, in mouse only full length Naa15 is widely expressed, whereas smaller transcripts seem to visualized only in heart and testis.|$|E
