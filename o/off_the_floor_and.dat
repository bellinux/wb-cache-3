As the series progressed and the budget increased, a stairway and balcony was installed in the foyer in an attempt to get characters <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> not all appear in the same geometric plane. For the first few seasons, the gym floor was made of real wooden floorboards; due to warping, it was replaced by concrete painted to look like wood.|$|E

25|$|As seen on Hart's documentary, Hart {{proceeded}} to the dressing rooms and questioned Michaels, who pleaded {{that he knew}} nothing about what had taken place and was equally outraged. McMahon locked himself in his office with Pat Patterson and other agents. Mark Calaway, known as The Undertaker, furious with McMahon, banged on the door. McMahon opened and was told he had to apologize to Hart. As recounted in Michaels' autobiography, he was told by McMahon not to say anything about the screwjob to anybody, because McMahon needed to have everyone think that it was only him involved. Michaels offered his assurance that he would not carry the title belt out the next day on Raw and would refuse to say anything derogatory about Hart. Hart {{proceeded to}} the dressing room to shower and change after discovering that McMahon, Brisco, and Remus had locked themselves in McMahon's office. When McMahon went to Hart's dressing room and tried to explain himself, Hart angrily rebuffed him and warned him to leave immediately or risk being punched. An altercation ensued, with Hart giving McMahon a single punch, dropping him to the floor. Although Vince's son, Shane McMahon, and Brisco struggled briefly with Hart and Davey Boy Smith, Hart told them to take McMahon and leave or risk similar consequences. Hart angrily asked McMahon {{if he was going to}} screw him on the pay he was still owed, to which a groggy McMahon replied in the negative. In the hallway outside the dressing rooms, Hart's then-wife Julie angrily confronted Triple H and others about the finish, but was escorted away by Owen Hart. McMahon had a black eye and a sprained ankle, which according to Bret Hart, was a result of his punch lifting Vince <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> Vince rolling his ankle once he landed. However, McMahon and Brisco have since stated on WWE Confidential that Brisco accidentally stepped on Vince's foot, which as he tried to get back to his feet immediately sprained his ankle and sent him back to the floor, from which he suffered a concussion, and referred to Brisco's action as a 'comedy.' Michaels and Triple H were later confronted and assailed by angry fans outside the Molson Centre and in the lobby of their hotel.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "cerulean speech", where Miranda {{draws the}} {{connection}} between the designer fashion in Runways pages and Andy's cerulean sweater, criticizing Andy's snobbishness about fashion and explaining the trickle-down effect, had its origins in a scene cut from earlier drafts that Streep had asked to have restored.

This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes the feeling that you are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

2500|$|Dancers use {{dressing}} rooms {{to prepare for}} performances, rest between performances, and stow any of their belongings not secured by other means.

[...] Dressing rooms are commonly used for performer-only mediation, though this could shift into other areas of discussion if management is involved. [...] Clubs are experimenting with granting greater access to restricted areas via technology. The service includes a live view into part of the backstage dressing room and paid access enables the website user to interact live with dancers at the club. [...] Security of club assets and personnel are a primary driver for limiting access to these zones.

2500|$|The villains of {{the story}} are the Wicked Witch of the West and the Wicked Witch of the East. [...] The wicked witches use their power to control and enslave their subjects. [...] There was an equal balance between good and evil, and until this balance was altered, {{there could be no}} change or {{development}} in Oz. This standoff can be seen as an allusion between the different political parties in America. [...] The Wicked Witch of the West represents the American West, including the wealthy railroad, oil barons, and nature. The American West's greatest weapon in the 19th century, though, was nature, most malignantly the drought. [...] The effects lasted longer than any fire or twister, and a long enough drought could ruin a whole year's worth of crops. [...] Thus, water as the weapon to kill the Witch of the West is quite poetic. [...] The brown mass the witch's remains turn into resembles mud after a heavy storm.

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of {{exercises}} {{that can be done to}} strengthen the lower leg. For example, in order to activate plantar flexors in the deep plantar flexors one can sit on the floor with the hips flexed, the ankle neutral with knees fully extended as they alternate pushing their foot against a wall or platform. This kind of exercise is beneficial as it hardly causes any fatigue. [...] Another form of isometric exercise for the gastrocnemius would be seated calf raises which can be done with or without equipment. One can be seated at a table with their feet flat on the ground, and then plantar flex both ankles so that the heels are raised <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>and</b> the gastrocnemius flexed. An alternate movement could be heel drop exercises with the toes being propped on an elevated surface—as an opposing movement this would improve the range of motion. One-legged toe raises for the gastrocnemius muscle can be performed by holding one dumbbell in one hand while using the other for balance, and then standing with one foot on a plate. The next step would be to plantar flex and keep the knee joint straight or flexed slightly. The triceps surae is contracted during this exercise. Stabilization exercises like the BOSU ball squat are also important especially as they assist in the ankles having to adjust to the ball’s form in order to balance.|$|E

5000|$|Sampedro {{brought a}} rawer {{edge to the}} Horse, and not just musically. [...] "Rock 'n' roll—I thought that meant Loot the Village and Rape the Women," [...] {{recalled}} Sampedro. Much {{to the consternation of}} Young, Sampedro frequently used heroin in his early days with the band, leading Young to once jump out of their car in Europe when he realized that Sampedro was procuring the drug. On a wild 1976 tour of Europe and Japan, Sampedro and Talbot took LSD before stepping onstage at the Budokan in Tokyo. [...] "I'd hit the strings of my guitar—they were like eighty different colors—and they bounced <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>floors</b> <b>and</b> hit <b>the</b> ceiling," [...] he later recalled. [...] According to Young, he and Sampedro [...] "did a lot of illegal things” during this period. Despite occasional tumult stemming from Young's signature mutability, the Sampedro version of the Horse would contribute to Young’s next two albums and notably served as the backing band for his acclaimed 1979 album/concert film Rust Never Sleeps. In November 1978, Crazy Horse also released Crazy Moon, their fourth non-Young album; six of the album's eleven songs were either written or co-written by Sampedro. Throughout the 1980s, the band also contributed to Young’s Re-ac-tor (1981), Trans (1982) and Life (1987).|$|R
