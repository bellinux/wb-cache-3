5|$|Priestley {{published}} {{the first volume}} of his projected history <b>of</b> <b>experimental</b> philosophy, The History and Present State of Discoveries Relating to Vision, Light and Colours (referred to as his Optics), in 1772. He paid careful attention to the history of optics and presented excellent explanations of early optics experiments, but his mathematical deficiencies caused him to dismiss several important contemporary theories. Furthermore, he did not include any of the practical sections that had made his History of Electricity so useful to practising natural philosophers. Unlike his History of Electricity, it was not popular and had only one edition, although it was the only English book on the topic for 150 years. The hastily written text sold poorly; the cost of researching, writing, and publishing the Optics convinced Priestley to abandon his history <b>of</b> <b>experimental</b> philosophy.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2001 Published by Elsevier ScienceVARIOG 2 D is a Fortran- 77 {{program that}} {{provides}} four basic operations for semi-variogram analysis: inference <b>of</b> the <b>experimental</b> semi-variogram, estimation <b>of</b> the variance–covariance matrix <b>of</b> the <b>experimental</b> semi-variogram, fitting a theoretical model by non-linear generalised least squares and {{estimation of the}} uncertainty of the semi-variogram model parameters. Although software for estimating the semi-variogram by the method of moments is widely available, there is no generally available software for assessing the uncertainty <b>of</b> the <b>experimental</b> semi-variogram. VARIOG 2 D provides the exact variance–covariance matrix <b>of</b> the <b>experimental</b> semi-variogram, which can be used for attaching standard errors to the experimental semi-variogram, for assessing the correlation between the different semi-variogram lag estimates and for fitting a model by generalised least squares. In addition, the generalised least-squares fitting procedure allows an evaluation of the uncertainty <b>of</b> the <b>experimental</b> semi-variogram and <b>of</b> the semi-variogram model parameters.

40|$|The {{effects of}} Supported Work on {{a sample of}} 1620 {{long-term}} AFDC recipients are analyzed in this paper. We find positive, statistically significant effects on the postprogram earnings <b>of</b> <b>experimentals.</b> Although the experimental effect declines sharply over time {{at one of the}} seven sites, at the others the effect increases somewhat faster than the rate of inflation. The postprogram effects are concentrated disproportionately in public-sector employment, but not in CETA/WIN positions. The increased earnings <b>of</b> <b>experimentals</b> leads to significant payment reductions in welfare. In the long run, we estimate that the experimental effect on earnings will be $ 53 per month for earnings and $ 22 per month for disposable income. ...|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, biological research was largely a professional endeavour. Most work was still done in the natural history mode, which emphasized morphological and phylogenetic analysis over experiment-based causal explanations. However, anti-vitalist experimental physiologists and embryologists, especially in Europe, were increasingly influential. The tremendous success <b>of</b> <b>experimental</b> approaches to development, heredity, and metabolism in the 1900s and 1910s demonstrated the power of experimentation in biology. In the following decades, experimental work replaced natural history as the dominant mode of research.|$|E
