In the west of its range it has spread to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, pushed further north in Norway, and first bred in the Netherlands in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the centuries}} the frescoes were greatly altered and damaged. In 1746 the upper levels were painted {{over by the}} artist Vincenzo Meucci, {{covering}} up most of Masolino's work. Then, in 1771, the church was ruined by fire. The Brancacci Chapel, though structurally undamaged by the fire, suffered great damages to its frescoes. It {{was not until the}} years 1981–1990 that a full-scale restoration of the chapel was undertaken, restoring the frescoes to approximately their original state. The paintings had suffered some irreparable damage though, particularly the parts that were painted a secco: in The Tribute Money, the leaves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> were gone, while Christ's robe had lost much of its original azure brilliance.|$|E
5|$|Mireille was {{the strongest}} typhoon to hit Japan since Typhoon Nancy in 1961, causing heavy damage in 41 of 47 prefectures. It was the third storm to strike Japan in two weeks. Damage was {{heaviest}} on Kyushu where the storm made landfall. Because the storm moved northeastward through the Sea of Japan, the eastern quadrant of the storm crossed {{over much of the}} country, which is where the strongest winds in tropical cyclones are located. The high winds downed trees, damaged roofs, and left record power outages, affecting 7.36million people, or about 13% of total customers. In some areas, the power outages lasted as little as three minutes. The storm damaged over 670,000houses, of which 1,058were destroyed, and another 22,965were flooded. Power outages caused at least five factories to shut down production. Along the coast, the typhoon damaged 930ships, with dozens sunk or blown ashore. Most of the damage was related to agriculture or forests. Sea spray heavily damaged fruit trees and rice paddies. Crop damage amounted to $3billion, mostly to the apple industry, after 345,000tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43,000 were damaged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> Most farms lost 80% of their crop, potentially taking 10years to regrow. Persistent cloudiness and rainfall following the storm diminished sunlight by 50%, furthering crop damage. There were 62deaths in Japan and 2,862injuries, including the deaths on the South Korean freighter, making it the deadliest typhoon there in 10years. About 80% of the deaths were male, and 70% were over 60years old. Most of the deaths were related to wind-blown debris, falling due to the wind, or being trapped or struck by fallen objects. The $6billion in insured losses and $10billion in overall damage made Mireille the costliest typhoon on record as of May 2014, according to Munich Re.|$|E

5|$|The typhoon first {{threatened}} Guam, {{although it}} passed {{well to the}} north of the island, bringing damaging winds to northern Saipan. The first part of Japan affected was Miyako-jima, where heavy rainfall and high winds damaged crops. Mireille lashed Okinawa with strong waves, while strong winds up to 189km/h (118mph) damaged power lines and trees. The typhoon ultimately caused damage in 41 of 47 prefectures of Japan, with overall damage estimated at $10billion (USD), making it the costliest typhoon on record as of 2014. Mireille produced record wind gusts at 26locations, with a peak gust of 218km/h (136mph) in western Honshu. The winds caused record power outages across Japan that affected 7.36million people, or about 13% of total customers. Mireille also left extensive crop damage totaling $3billion, mostly to the apple industry, after 345,000tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43,000 were damaged <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> The storm damaged over 670,000houses, of which 1,058 were destroyed, and another 22,965 were flooded. Throughout Japan, Mireille killed 66people and injured another 2,862people, including ten deaths on a capsized freighter. Elsewhere, the typhoon killed two people in South Korea, and its remnants brought strong winds to Alaska.|$|E

25|$|The foliage is a dull dark {{to light}} green color, with scale-like leaves 1-1.5mm long, with the leaf tips not spreading; {{seedlings}} bear needle-like leaves 8–10mm long.

The seeds are 3–5mm long, with a pair of small wings along the sides. The cones remain closed <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> for many years, until the trees are killed by a forest fire; after the tree is dead, the cones open to release the seeds which can then germinate successfully on the bare fire-cleared ground.|$|E

The album's final tracks are Smith's [...] "Somalia" [...] and an acoustic rendition of [...] "Yellow" [...] (2000) by Coldplay. Turlington said of [...] "Somalia": Patti {{told me she}} wrote this song years ago, after seeing a segment on the news in which a child literally died {{in the arms of}} its mother. That memory was still very present to her in 2011 during the crisis in the Horn of Africa, so she thought, [...] "If I could give this mother what I have — fruit <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> a healthy child — I would." [...] She went into the studio and brought along her daughter, who's now grown and married, to play piano, and gave us this version of the song.|$|E
500|$|MD235 {{follows the}} path of {{what was the first}} major long-distance highway in St. Mary's County, the Patuxent Main Road. [...] The road, {{established}} by 1692, connected Point Lookout and northern St. Mary's County along the drainage divide between the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay. [...] The Patuxent Main Road later became known as the Three Notch Road based on a 1704 law that stated [...] "three notches of equal distance marked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> indicated a road leading to a ferry." [...] The whereabouts of the ferry to which this road led are unknown. [...] After 200 years of little improvement, reconstruction of the Three Notch Road by the Maryland State Roads Commission began in 1923 when the highway was rebuilt as a [...] wide gravel road from MD5 near Mechanicsville south to MD472 in Oakville. [...] The gravel road was extended south from Oakville [...] to Friendship School Road in 1924.|$|E
500|$|Maple {{sugaring}} parties typically {{began to}} operate {{at the start of}} the spring thaw in regions of woodland with sufficiently large numbers of maples. Syrup makers first bored holes in the trunks, usually more than one hole per large tree; they then inserted wooden spouts into the holes and hung a wooden bucket from the protruding end of each spout to collect the sap. The buckets were commonly made by cutting cylindrical segments from a large tree trunk and then hollowing out each segment's core from one end of the cylinder, creating a seamless, watertight container. Sap filled the buckets, and was then either transferred to larger holding vessels (barrels, large pots, or hollowed-out wooden logs), often mounted on sledges or wagons pulled by draft animals, or carried in buckets or other convenient containers. The sap-collection buckets were returned to the spouts mounted <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> and the process was repeated for as long as the flow of sap remained [...] "sweet". The specific weather conditions of the thaw period were, and still are, critical in determining the length of the sugaring season. As the weather continues to warm, a maple tree's normal early spring biological process eventually alters the taste of the sap, making it unpalatable, perhaps due to an increase in amino acids.|$|E

500|$|In {{selectively}} logged eucalypt {{forests in}} the central highlands of Victoria, {{it has been estimated}} that about 3–5% of the forest area is [...] "moderately to severely affected" [...] by Armillaria root rot caused by A.luteobubalina. A review of eucalypt plantations planted in New South Wales from 1994 to 2005 found that infection by A.luteobubalina was rare, and only accounted for 1% of mortality in total. In this instance, the cases had been restricted to Eucalyptus nitens on the Dorrigo Plateau. Unlike other Armillaria species found in Australia's native forests, which require a host tree to become weakened by prior infection by a different species, A.luteobubalina is a primary pathogen, and can infect healthy trees. Tree roots may be infected for years before showing above-ground symptoms, making it difficult to accurately assess the true extent of disease in a forest stand. Surveys are usually conducted in autumn, to coincide with the appearance of fruit bodies; infection is assessed by the presence of basal scars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> and the appearance of fruit bodies. Several factors, however—such as cost, variable on-site conditions, and non-symptomatic diseased trees—make it difficult for such surveys to reliably detect all infections. One study showed that above-ground examinations detected only 50% of the trees actually infected, leading to underestimation of the incidence of true infection by 20–40%. The study used more intensive surveying methods to determine that 25- to 30-year-old karri regrowth forests in western Australia showed an average of 40–45% incidence of infection.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "Possibly the best Simpsons episode, with a {{constant}} stream of gags, inspired animation (in particular the sequence when Homer begins to see and hear Moe everywhere, from Maggie's gurgles to the leaves <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees),</b> and a superb plot that twists about in every direction but the one you might expect." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson wrote [...] "From Lisa’s slumber party at the opening through the Cheers spoof at Moe’s, this episode’s another real winner. Homer gets some of his all-time best lines, including a great run where he mocks Marge’s attempts to have him accept his fate. We even find a great twist on Bart’s prank phone calls when he asks for “Hugh Jass”. All in all, “Flaming” provides a terrific show." [...] Nate Meyers of Digitally Obsessed gave the episode 5/5, calling it [...] "another great chapter in the history of The Simpsons, with tons of laughs throughout." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine called it [...] "a very funny episode" [...] and highlighted the plot's focus on Moe as [...] "an example of the show gradually expanding its supporting townspeople into characters in their own right," [...] as [...] "Moe was just an angry bartender before this episode. After this one, he's the sad man who sometimes tastes success but always lets it slip away because of his inability {{to do the right thing}} until it's too late." [...] VanDerWerff also interpreted the episode as a metaphor for Simon's relationship with fellow The Simpsons developers Groening and James L. Brooks and Simon's belief that he was not receiving enough credit for The Simpsons.|$|E
