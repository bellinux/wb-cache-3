Temporally <b>Ordered</b> <b>Routing</b> Algorithm (TORA) is one of the commonly used protocols for ad-hoc wireless networks.

40|$|Wide {{implementation}} of IEEE 802. 11 based networks {{could lead to}} deployment of localized wireless data communication environments with {{a limited number of}} mobile hosts, called ad hoc networks. Implementation of a proper routing methodology in ad hoc networks makes it efficient in terms of performance. A wide spectrum of routing protocols has been contributed by several researchers. Real time applications have been most popular among the applications, run by ad hoc networks. Such applications strictly adhere to the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements such as overall throughput, end-toend delay and power level. Support of QoS requirements becomes more challenging due to dynamic nature of MANETs, where mobility of nodes results in frequent change in topology. QoS aware routing protocols can serve to the QoS support, which concentrate on determining a path between source and destination with the QoS requirements of the flow being satisfied. We propose a protocol, called Power and Delay aware Temporally <b>Ordered</b> <b>Routing</b> Algorithm (PDTORA), based on Temporally <b>Ordered</b> <b>Routing</b> Algorithm (TORA) Protocol, where verification of power and delay requirements is carried out with a query packet at each node along the path between source and destination.

40|$|Abstract: Wireless {{networks}} are gaining popularity day by day, as users want wireless connectivity irrespective of their geographic position. There {{is an increasing}} threat of malicious nodes attacks on the Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANET). Distributed denial of service attack {{is one of the}} security threat in which is used to make the network resources unavailable. The distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is launched from various attacking nodes, hence called DDoS. DDoS is an improved form of denial of service attack. MANETs must have a secure way for transmission and communication which is quite challenging and vital issue. In order to provide secure communication and transmission, researcher worked specifically on the security issues in MANETs, and many secure routing protocols and security measures within the networks were proposed. An ad hoc network is a collection of wireless mobile nodes dynamically forming a temporary network without the use of any existing network infrastructure or centralized administration. Two popular MANET routing protocols like Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) and Temporally <b>Ordered</b> <b>Routing</b> Algorithm (TORA) have been implemented. The scope of this thesis is to study the effects of DDoS attack in MANET using both Ad-Hoc on Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Temporally <b>Ordered</b> <b>Routing</b> Algorithm (TORA). Comparative analysis of DDoS attack for both protocols is taken into account. The impact of DDoS attack on the performance of MANET is evaluated finding out which protocol is more vulnerable to the attack and how much is the impact of the attack on both protocols. The measurements were taken in the light of throughput, end-to-end delay, network load and various other parameters. In this project an attempt has been made to compare the performance of two prominent on-demand reactive routing protocols for mobile ad hoc networks: AODV and TORA, under the norma...|$|R
