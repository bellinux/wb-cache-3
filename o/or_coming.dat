5|$|American {{alligator}} predation on Florida panthers is rare, but {{has been}} documented. Such incidents usually involve a panther trying to cross a waterway <b>or</b> <b>coming</b> down to a swamp or river to get a drink. The American alligator is the only known natural predator of the panther. American alligator predation on black bears has also been recorded.|$|E
5|$|From ancient sources, such as Chinese oracle bones, it {{is known}} that their {{appearances}} have been noticed by humans for millennia.

5|$|Neither Monmouth nor its castle were {{attacked}} in the rebellion of Owain Glyndŵr between 1400 and 1415, although nearby Abergavenny and Grosmont were burned {{down in the}} uprising. The unrest of the period had {{a negative impact on}} the development of the town. But the bridge continued its important function as a toll-gate. Philip Jones, Member of Parliament for Monmouth Boroughs in 1589, bequeathed an annual sum of about £120, the rent from his lands and houses at 'Bayliepitte', to the mayor and bailiffs of Monmouth on condition that the borough exempt those people passing through the gate <b>or</b> <b>coming</b> into Monmouth with cattle from paying tolls on fair days.|$|E

5|$|The {{book has}} often been {{described}} as a Bildungsroman <b>or</b> <b>coming</b> of age story, as it explores Ged's process of learning to cope with power and come to terms with death. The novel also carries Taoist themes about a fundamental balance in the universe of Earthsea, which wizards are supposed to maintain, closely tied to the idea that language and names have power to affect the material world and alter this balance. Although the structure of the story {{is similar to that of}} a traditional epic, critics have also described it as subverting this genre in many ways, such as by making the protagonist dark-skinned, in comparison to more typical white-skinned heroes.|$|E
5|$|PlayStation Underground was a {{non-traditional}} {{magazine that}} Sony Computer Entertainment America produced and published between Spring 1997 to Spring 2001. Subscribers received two PlayStation CDs, {{along with a}} booklet and colorful packaging every quarter. The CDs contained interviews, cheats, programmers moves, game demos and one-of-a-kind Memory Card saves. Several issues showed how a game was created from basic design to final product. Since the CDs could only be run on a PlayStation, it proved a useful marketing tool which spawned a line of PlayStation Underground JamPacks Demo CDs and which contained highlights from recent issues of PlayStation Underground, along with seemingly as many game demos that could be packed on a single CD. Unlike PlayStation Underground these were available in most stores for $4.95, were published twice a year in Summer and Winter and usually spotlighted newly released <b>or</b> <b>coming</b> soon games. By 2001, Sony had decided to phase out Underground {{to focus on the}} JamPacks with the release of the PlayStation 2. PlayStation Underground CDs are mainly in the hands of collectors these days.|$|E
5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{is considered}} an apex predator throughout its range. They are opportunists and their diet is determined largely by both the size and age of the American alligator and the size and availability of prey. Most American alligators will eat {{a wide variety of}} animals, including invertebrates, fish, birds, turtles, snakes, amphibians, and mammals. Hatchlings mostly feed on invertebrates such as insects, insect larvae, snails, spiders, and worms. As they grow, American alligators gradually expand to larger prey. Once an American alligator reaches adulthood, any animal living in the water <b>or</b> <b>coming</b> to the water to drink is potential prey, due to the size and power of the American alligator. However, most animals captured by American alligators are considerably smaller than the American alligator itself. Stomach contents show, among native mammals, muskrats and raccoons {{are some of the most}} commonly eaten species. In Louisiana, where introduced coypu are common, they are perhaps the most regular prey for adult American alligators, although only larger adult American alligators commonly eat this species. Other animals may occasionally be eaten, even large deer or feral wild boars, but these are not normally part of the diet. Occasionally, domestic animals, including dogs, cats, and calves, are taken as available, but are secondary to wild and feral prey. Other prey, including snakes, lizards, and various invertebrates, are eaten occasionally by adults. Water birds, such as herons and egrets, storks, waterfowl and large dabbling rails such as gallinules or coots, are taken when possible. Occasionally, unwary adult birds are grabbed and eaten by American alligators, but most predation on bird species occur with unsteady fledgling birds in late summer as the prey of American alligators, as fledgling birds attempt to make their first flights near the water's edge.|$|E

Hand-drawn destination signs were hung up covering the old ones from pre-1961; these signs were both crumbling from age and obviously missing the termini of post-1961 line extensions.
