5|$|Given {{the varied}} and even {{contradictory}} {{interpretations of the}} colour green, its precise meaning in the poem remains ambiguous. In English folklore and literature, green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes: fertility and rebirth. Stories of the medieval period also used it to allude to love and the base desires of man. Because of its connection with faeries and spirits in early English folklore, green also signified witchcraft, devilry and evil. It can also represent decay and toxicity. When combined with gold, as with the Green Knight and the girdle, green was often seen as representing youth's passing. In Celtic mythology, green was associated with misfortune and death, and therefore avoided in clothing. The green girdle, originally worn for protection, became a symbol <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> cowardice; it is finally adopted {{as a symbol of}} honour by the knights of Camelot, signifying a transformation from good to evil and back again; this displays both the spoiling and regenerative connotations of the colour green.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties. It establishes {{that there may}} be an inverse relation between the rate <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties <b>and</b> their deterrent effects - the more people are shamed the less deterring shaming penalties become. This conclusion is based on a search model in which the costs of searching for law-abiding partners increase with the rate <b>of</b> <b>shaming,</b> <b>and</b> may lead to lower expected sanction for offenders. The inverse relation between the rate <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties <b>and</b> their effectiveness is later used to show that increasing the probability of detection, increasing the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties or reducing the number of wrongful acquittals does not necessarily increase the deterrent effects <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> penalties (<b>and</b> may, in fact, decrease these effects). ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how {{different aspects of}} perfectionism in athletes (N = 388) related to the different fears of failure proposed by Conroy et al. (2002), and how perfectionism and fears of failure predicted positive and negative affect after imagined success and failure in sports competitions. Results showed that perfectionistic personal standards showed a negative relationship with fear <b>of</b> experiencing <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> embarrassment and a positive relationship with positive affect after success, whereas perfectionistic concern over mistakes and perceived parental pressure showed a positive relationship with fear <b>of</b> experiencing <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> embarrassment and with negative affect after failure. Moreover, fear <b>of</b> experiencing <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> embarrassment fully mediated the relationship between perfectionistic concern and negative affect and between coach pressure and negative affect. The findings demonstrate that fear <b>of</b> experiencing <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> embarrassment is central in the perfectionism-fear of failure relationship and that perfectionistic concern about mistakes and perceived coach pressure are aspects of perfectionism that predict fear <b>of</b> experiencing <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> embarrassment and negative affect after failure...|$|R

5|$|Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladova, {{variously}} called Sonya and Sonechka, is {{the daughter}} of a drunkard named Semyon Zakharovich Marmeladov, whom Raskolnikov meets in a tavern {{at the beginning of the}} novel. She is often characterized as self-sacrificial, shy, and even innocent despite the fact that she is compelled into prostitution to help her family. She also, as Raskolnikov discerns, shares the same feelings <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> alienation as he does and becomes the first person to whom Raskolnikov confesses his crime, and she supports him even though she was friends with one of the victims (Lizaveta). Throughout the novel, Sonya is an important source of moral strength and rehabilitation for Raskolnikov, and in some interpretations, even considered a Christ-like figure. She is forced to prostitute herself to provide for her family, leading some critics to make comparisons with Mary Magdalene.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the use <b>of</b> <b>shaming</b> <b>and</b> stigma against financial criminals and evidence for and against their impact.

It suggests that potential damage to business prospects is probably more salient than shame per se to impact of informal sanctions, but that culture is an important component of the process <b>of</b> <b>shaming,</b> <b>and</b> that further research is needed before we can be confident about the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> in this area, quite apart from the difficulties of applying it in practice...|$|R

25|$|While the {{intensity}} of the emotion does not seem to influence whether an emotional event is shared or kept secret, the type of emotion involved does appear to play a role. Specifically, emotional experiences involving feelings <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> guilt tend to be shared less frequently, less often, and with fewer people. While sharing of emotional events involves self-disclosure, feelings <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> guilt are associated with concealment of the self.|$|E

25|$|Abuse {{of parents}} by their {{children}} is a common but under-reported and under-researched subject. Parents are quite often subject to levels of childhood aggression, typically {{in the form of}} verbal or physical abuse, in excess of normal childhood aggressive outbursts.

25|$|Educational {{psychology}} {{research on}} motivation {{is concerned with}} the volition or will that students bring to a task, their level of interest and intrinsic motivation, the personally held goals that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of their success or failure. As intrinsic motivation deals with activities that act as their own rewards, extrinsic motivation deals with motivations that are brought on by consequences or punishments. A form of attribution theory developed by Bernard Weiner describes how students' beliefs about the causes of academic success or failure affect their emotions and motivations. For example, when students attribute failure to lack of ability, and ability is perceived as uncontrollable, they experience the emotions <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> embarrassment and consequently decrease effort and show poorer performance. In contrast, when students attribute failure to lack of effort, and effort is perceived as controllable, they experience the emotion of guilt and consequently increase effort and show improved performance.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} whether patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) experience more general feelings <b>of</b> guilt <b>and</b> <b>shame</b> than their peers without RA and to examine possible correlates <b>of</b> guilt <b>and</b> <b>shame</b> in RA. In a cross-sectional survey study, 85 out-patients with RA (77 % female; median disease duration, 11 years) and 59 peer controls completed the Experience <b>of</b> <b>Shame</b> Scale (ESS) <b>and</b> the Test of Self-Conscious Affect (TOSCA). Patients additionally completed measures of health status, self-efficacy, cognitive emotion regulation, and numerical rating scales for life satisfaction and happiness. Patients and peer controls were well matched for sociodemographic characteristics. No significant differences between patients and controls were found for guilt or different types <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> as measured with the TOSCA or ESS. In multivariate analyses, female patients reported more feelings <b>of</b> bodily <b>shame</b> <b>and</b> higher guilt proneness, while younger patients reported more character <b>and</b> bodily <b>shame.</b> Worse social functioning and more self-blaming coping strategies were the strongest independent correlates <b>of</b> <b>shame.</b> Shame proneness was only independently associated with more self-blame, whereas guilt proneness was only associated with female sex. None of the physical aspects of the disease, including pain and physical functioning, correlated with feelings <b>of</b> guilt <b>and</b> <b>shame.</b> Patients with longstanding RA do not experience more general feelings <b>of</b> <b>shame</b> or guilt than their peers without RA. <b>Shame</b> <b>and</b> guilt in RA is primarily associated with demographic and psychosocial characteristics and not with physical severity of the diseas...|$|R
