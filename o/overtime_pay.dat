50|$|On 23 April 2014, {{after an}} {{investigation}} by the United States Department of Labor (USDOL), the company was found to have violated the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The government found that <b>paying</b> employees <b>overtime,</b> <b>paying</b> employees a minimum wage, and proper record keeping was not being done by the company. During the investigation, the government found that all employees were paid a weekly salary, regardless of how many hours they worked. Because employees were frequently coerced to work overtime, this resulted in a wage of $6/hour for some employees. Furthermore, until 2011, the company attempted to skirt minimum wage and overtime laws by classifying their on-site exclusive long-term employees as independent contractors, which is illegal in the United States.|$|R
25|$|Higher pay for {{overtime}} hours {{can reduce}} or negate {{the effect of}} a backward bending labour supply curve, by increasing wages only for hours worked beyond a certain amount. Overtime maintains the substitution effect at a high labour supply. However, the income effect from the wages increasing on all the previous hours worked is eliminated. Thus, higher hourly <b>overtime</b> <b>pay</b> can cause workers to work more hours than if the higher rate is paid on all hours.|$|E
25|$|Not every unfair act {{amounts to}} an unfair labor practice; as an example, failing to pay an {{individual}} worker <b>overtime</b> <b>pay</b> for hours worked in excess of forty hours in a week might {{be a violation of}} the Fair Labor Standards Act, but it is unlikely to amount to an unfair labor practice as well. Similarly, a violation of a collective bargaining agreement, standing alone, may not constitute an unfair labor practice unless the employer has not only violated the contract but repudiated all or part of it.|$|E
25|$|Federal {{labor law}} sets {{standards}} {{in the areas of}} health, safety, and hours.

The law sets minimums for periods of rest, requiring a minimum of 12 hours of rest to start a new workday. Sundays are holidays, and those required to work on Sundays are paid double. However, laws governing acceptable conditions of work were not enforced universally, particularly for workers in the informal sector.|$|E

25|$|The {{fund-raising}} {{success of}} the union and the pressure from the 40-hour work week drive pushed the employers {{to agree to a}} new collective bargaining agreement. The manufacturers signaled their willingness to talk on May 26, but the union kept up its demand for the 40-hour week. A mediator was called in, and a new contract reached on June 11, 1926. The contract provided for the 40-hour, five-day work week; an end to overtime from December through August; time-and-a-half <b>overtime</b> <b>pay</b> for half-days from September to November; a 10 percent wage increase; 10 paid holidays; and a ban on subcontracting.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{in early}} May 1954, the {{tensions}} escalated to strikes. First, {{a series of}} strikes broke out against United Fruit Company operations on Honduras's Caribbean coast.

The strikers presented a wide range of grievances, involving wages, working conditions, medical benefits, <b>overtime</b> <b>pay,</b> and the right to collective bargaining. Initial government efforts to end the strike failed, and work stoppages began to spread into other industries. By May 21, the number of strikers was approaching 30,000, and the nation's economy was under severe strain.|$|E
25|$|In Iran in 1918, {{the work}} of reorganizing the trade unions began in earnest in Tehran during {{the closure of the}} Iranian {{constitutional}} parliament Majles. The printers' union, established in 1906 by Mohammad Parvaneh as the first trade union, in the Koucheki print shop on Nasserieh Avenue in Tehran, reorganized their union under leadership of Russian-educated Seyed Mohammad Dehgan, a newspaper editor and an avowed Communist. In 1918, the newly organised union staged a 14-day strike and succeeded in reaching a collective agreement with employers to institute the eight-hours day, <b>overtime</b> <b>pay,</b> and medical care. The success of the printers' union encouraged other trades to organize. In 1919 the bakers and textile-shop clerks formed their own trade unions.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper offers}} a contract-based theory {{to explain the}} {{determination}} of standard hours, overtime hours and <b>overtime</b> premium <b>pay.</b> We expand on the wage contract literature that emphasises the role of firm-specific human capital and that explores problems of contract efficiency {{in the face of}} information asymmetries between the firm and the worker. We first explore a simple wage-hours contract without overtime and show that incorporating hours into the contract may itself produce efficiency gains. We then show how the introduction of overtime hours, remunerated at premium rates, can further improve contract efficiency. Our modelling outcomes in respect {{of the relationship between the}} overtime premium and the standard wage rate relate closely to earlier developments in hedonic wage theory. Throughout, we emphasise the intuitive reasoning behind the theory and we also supply relevant empirical evidence. Mathematical derivations are provided in an Appendix.

25|$|In May 2007, the NYC {{warehouse}} workers {{came together}} with the Starbucks Workers Union to form The Food and Allied Workers Union IU 460/640. In the summer of 2007, the IWW organized workers at two new warehouses: Flaum Appetizing, a Kosher food distributor, and Wild Edibles, a seafood company. Over the course of 2007–08, workers at both shops were illegally terminated for their union activity. In 2008, the workers at Wild Edibles actively fought to get their jobs back and to secure <b>overtime</b> <b>pay</b> owed {{to them by the}} boss. In a workplace justice campaign called Focus on the Food Chain, carried out jointly with Brandworkers International, the IWW workers won settlements against employers including Pur Pac, Flaum Appetizing and Wild Edibles.|$|E
25|$|Ridgway {{was arrested}} in 1982 and 2001 on charges related to prostitution. He became {{a suspect in the}} Green River killings in 1983. In 1984, Ridgway took and passed a {{polygraph}} test (quality control protocols later developed in the FBI after careful review determined that Ridgway actually failed his polygraph test), and on April 7, 1987, police took hair and saliva samples from Ridgway. Around 1985, Ridgway began dating Judith Mawson, who became his third wife in 1988. Mawson claimed in a 2010 television interview that when she moved into his house while they were dating, there was no carpet. Detectives later told her he had probably wrapped a body in the carpet. In the same interview, she described how he would leave for work early in the morning some days, ostensibly for the <b>overtime</b> <b>pay.</b> Mawson speculated that he must have committed some of the murders while supposedly working these early morning shifts. She claimed that she had not suspected Ridgway's crimes before she was contacted by authorities in 1987, and had not even heard of the Green River Killer before that time because she did not watch the news.|$|E
