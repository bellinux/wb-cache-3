5|$|Since the {{resettlement}} of Svalbard in {{the early}} 20th century, coal mining has been the dominant commercial activity. Store Norske Spitsbergen Kulkompani, {{a subsidiary of the}} Norwegian Ministry of Trade and Industry, operates Svea Nord in Sveagruva and Mine 7 in Longyearbyen. The former produced 3.4 million tonnes in 2008, while the latter uses 35% of its output to Longyearbyen Power Station. Since 2007, there has not been any significant mining by the Russian state-owned Arktikugol in Barentsburg. There have previously been performed test drilling for petroleum on land, but these did not give satisfactory results for permanent operation. The Norwegian authorities do not allow offshore petroleum activities for environmental reasons, and the land formerly test-drilled <b>on</b> <b>has</b> been protected as natural reserves or national parks. In 2011, a 20-year plan to develop offshore oil and gas resources around Svalbard was announced.|$|E
5|$|The 1996 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season had 13 named storms, of which 9 became hurricanes and 6 became major hurricanes (hurricanes that {{are classified as}} Category 3 or higher). These major hurricanes were Bertha, Edouard, Fran, Hortense, Isidore, and Lili. This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation.

5|$|The 1997 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the most}} active season since the 1994 season, producing 24tropical depressions, 19 of which became tropical storms or hurricanes. The season officially started on May 15, 1997 in the Eastern Pacific—designated as the area east of 140°W—and on June 1, 1997 in the Central Pacific, which is between the International Date Line and 140°W. The season officially ended in both basins on November 30, 1997. These dates typically limit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the eastern Pacific basin. This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation.

25|$|On March 16, 1998, the LIRR closed ten stops {{with low}} {{ridership}} rather than modify them for access {{for people with}} disabilities and to accommodate the new double-decker trains. Five stations were on the Lower Montauk Branch (Glendale, Penny Bridge, Haberman, Fresh Pond and Richmond Hill), and five others were in Nassau and Suffolk Counties (Holtsville, Mill Neck, Center Moriches, Quogue, and Southampton Campus). The stations in Nassau and Suffolk had between 12 and 20 passengers per day, while the stations on the Lower Montauk had daily ridership between 1 and 5 passengers. Trains to Long Island City continued to operate via the Lower Montauk, but instead bypassed the stations. The trains to Long Island City ran via the Lower Montauk until November 12, 2012, when the Lower Montauk was leased to and controlled by the New York and Atlantic Railway, which from then <b>on</b> <b>has</b> used the line exclusively for freight operation. In order to keep the Lower Montauk in service, the LIRR would have had to install the expensive Positive Train Control systems along {{the entire length of the}} Lower Montauk for just one train a day. As a result, the LIRR decided that it was not worth the expense and just shifted the one passenger and couple deadhead trains to the Mainline instead. The NY downgraded the branch to a secondary track.|$|E
500|$|The album {{has been}} {{regarded}} by many music writers and critics as a landmark recording in soul music. It furthered funk music's popularity during the 1970s, and its smooth soul sound marked a change for his record label's previous {{success with the}} [...] "Motown Sound" [...] formula. Let's Get It <b>On</b> <b>has</b> been ranked on many critics and publications' lists of the best albums of all time. In 2001, it was reissued by Motown Records as a two-disc deluxe edition release.|$|E
500|$|After {{critical}} re-examination of the album, I Want You {{has been}} recognized by writers and music writers as one of Marvin Gaye's most controversial and influential works and, much like its predecessor Let's Get It <b>On,</b> <b>has</b> served as {{a major influence on}} the quiet storm and contemporary R genres. Its standing has also improved among critics following an expanded edition release of the album on July 29, 2003, which featured extensive liner notes and photography by Ryan Null. Following that release, Allmusic praised Gaye's different direction in music and the eroticism portrayed in Leon Ware's smooth-tempo production and Gaye's intimate lyricism.

500|$|Over the centuries, {{the cathedral}} has {{suffered}} damage. A fire in 1967 destroyed {{a significant part}} of the cathedral's interior. The restoration work that followed uncovered a number of important documents and artwork that had previously been hidden. [...] Although a solid foundation was built for the cathedral, the soft clay soil it is built <b>on</b> <b>has</b> been a threat to its structural integrity. [...] Dropping water tables and accelerated sinking caused the structure to be added to the World Monuments Fund list of the 100Most Endangered Sites. Reconstruction work beginning in the 1990s stabilized the cathedral and it was removed from the endangered list in 2000.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{telephone}} line network which the Meganet ran <b>on</b> <b>has</b> {{been criticized for}} its logistical issues in online gaming.

500|$|The British {{conduct of}} the Battle of Villers-Bocage has been controversial, because their {{withdrawal}} {{marked the end of}} the post D-Day [...] "scramble for ground" [...] and the start of an attritional battle for Caen.

The [...] "single-handed" [...] attack by Wittmann early <b>on,</b> <b>has</b> excited imaginations to the extent that some historians and writers conclude that it has dominated the historical record to an unwarranted degree and that while [...] "remarkable", the role of Wittmann in the battle has been exaggerated.|$|E

500|$|There's a Riot Goin' <b>On</b> <b>has</b> been {{considered}} one of the first instances of the funk music later popularized by George Clinton and Funkadelic, the Ohio Players, and similar acts. The album, as well as the follow-ups Fresh and Small Talk, are considered among the first and best examples of the matured version of funk music, after prototypical instances of the sound in Sly & the Family Stone's 1960s work. Riots sound also helped inspire Davis and Herbie Hancock to crossover to jazz-funk. It was called [...] "a masterpiece of darkly psychedelic funk" [...] by AllMusic contributor Steve Huey, and [...] "a phenomenal, dirty, psychedelic funk album" [...] by Drowned in Sound journalist Jon Falcone, who said it soundtracked the political and social turbulence that opened the 1970s. Paul Grimstad from Brooklyn Rail regarded it as a [...] "frigid yet weirdly intimate" [...] avant-pop record.|$|E
500|$|Much like What's Going On, Let's Get It <b>On</b> <b>has</b> been {{included}} in {{a significant number of}} [...] "best album" [...] lists by critics and publications. It was ranked number 58 on The Timess 1993 publication of the 100 Best Albums of All Time. Blender magazine ranked the album number 15 on its list of the 100 Greatest American Albums of All Time. In 2003, it was ranked number 165 on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time publication, his second highest entry on the list, as well as one of three Marvin Gaye albums to be included; What's Going On (number 6) and Here, My Dear (number 462). Let's Get It On was reissued that same year by Universal Music; the re-release was later given a silver certification by the British Phonographic Industry. In 2004, Let's Get It On was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and cited by The Recording Academy as a recording of [...] "historical significance".|$|E
500|$|Jacob Acaye, {{the former}} child soldier {{featured}} in the film, supported the video and defended its makers.

Now what was happening in Gulu is still going on elsewhere in the Central African Republic and in Congo. What about the people who are suffering over there?

[...] It was noted by Los Angeles Times journalists Lindsay Branham and Jocelyn Kelly that a number of people living in the areas where the LRA is currently active have previously called for attention and advocacy to be directed at the issue. Julien Marneffe, a worker for Catholic Relief Services in Goma said [...] "it's been an undeniable success -- and one all humanitarian organizations working in this area can be happy about," [...] but added to [...] "be careful not to oversimplify the issue" [...] and worried that the interest might be short lived when [...] "another crisis or another video will be the next online trend, and I fear that most people will forget about the problems of the LRA." ...|$|E
