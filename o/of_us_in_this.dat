2500|$|On 20 November 1995, {{a sensational}} {{interview}} with the Princess of Wales was broadcast by the BBC. The strife between Charles and Diana became public as never before, and Diana's famous [...] "there were three <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> marriage" [...] undoubtedly referred to Parker-Bowles. There {{was no mention of}} Legge-Bourke. However, on 24 January 1996, newspapers named Diana as the source of an untrue rumour circulated in November and December 1995 that Legge-Bourke had become pregnant by Charles and had had an abortion. [...] It was reported that words had been exchanged between Diana and Legge-Bourke on the matter at a party on 14 December 1995, when Diana had said to her [...] "So sorry about the baby", and an [...] "informed source" [...] was quoted as saying [...] "The Queen was absolutely furious and totally in sympathy with Tiggy." [...] On 18 December 1995, Legge-Bourke, with the Queen's agreement, instructed the libel lawyer Peter Carter-Ruck to write to Diana's solicitors demanding an apology, asking that the accusation be [...] "recognized to be totally untrue".|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{know what}} you are {{thinking}} of, John,' said Mr. Freeman, in a serious tone. 'You are thinking, if anything were to happen to either <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> heathen land, where we should get Christian burial.' ...|$|E
