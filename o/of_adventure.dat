5|$|The 1988 Dungeons & Dragons {{role-playing}} game module Ruins <b>of</b> <b>Adventure</b> {{was produced}} {{using the same}} adventure scenario as Pool of Radiance, using the same plot, background, setting, {{and many of the}} same characters as the computer game.

5|$|In 1991, {{planning}} began {{for a new}} {{theme park}} adjacent to Universal Studios Florida. By the end of 1993, {{it was decided that}} one area of the future Islands <b>of</b> <b>Adventure</b> theme park would be themed after Marvel Comics, with a Hulk theme being selected for a thrill ride. The designers of the ride wanted to simulate being fired out of a cannon and subsequently set about prototyping a launch system. Universal Creative and MTS Systems Corporation had a working prototype in January 1995. Methods to achieve this acceleration were investigated into mid-1996. On-site construction of Islands <b>of</b> <b>Adventure</b> was underway in 1997, with Superior Rigging & Erection being responsible for erecting the supports and track of the roller coaster. On May 28, 1999, Islands <b>of</b> <b>Adventure</b> officially opened to the public, with The Incredible Hulk being one of its debut attractions.|$|E

5|$|The idea of {{creating}} a Hogwarts Express-related attraction came from Mark Woodbury, the president of Universal Creative. After {{the opening of the}} Hogsmeade attraction at the Islands <b>of</b> <b>Adventure</b> theme park in 2010, Universal began considering how to keep attendance balanced between the adjacent parks. At first, the creative team considered putting Diagon Alley within Islands <b>of</b> <b>Adventure.</b> Eventually they decided that the London and Hogsmeade environments should not be visible between one another. As a result, Woodbury proposed building Diagon Alley in Universal Studios Florida and then connecting the two Harry Potter-themed lands with the Hogwarts Express train.|$|E
