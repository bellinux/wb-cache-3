5|$|Results from a {{histological}} {{analysis performed}} on a rib from specimen FMNH PR 3847 were reported by McDonald and colleagues in 2017. Extensive bone remodeling {{has occurred in the}} internal matrix of the rib. The medullary cavity, which houses the marrow, is marked by the presence of many cavities, or lacunae. On the outer surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone,</b> osteons have almost completely replaced the interior of the bone; the layered growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> is more visible on the interior <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone,</b> where five lines of arrested growth (LAGs) are visible. A sixth LAG is possibly present within the medullary region, but is relatively limited in extent, which makes this identification questionable.|$|E

5|$|The maxilla (upper jaw) {{is known}} only for A.donovani. In these fossils, the back {{margin of the}} incisive foramen (an opening in the palate) is about {{at the same level}} as the front of M1, and the back margin of the {{zygomatic}} plate (a bony plate {{at the side of the}} skull, connected to the zygomatic arch) is also close to the front of M1. Mandibles (lower jaws) of both species are known. The mental foramen (an opening in the front of the jaw bone) opens towards the labial side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone,</b> except in one mandible of A.praeuniversitatis, in which its opening is located higher. There is a well-developed capsular processâ€”a raising in the bone that houses the root of the lower incisor. The masseteric ridges (two ridges on the labial side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> that anchor some of the chewing muscles) are joined into a single crest towards the front and reach to a point below the front of m1.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{generally}} {{resembles that}} of the brown-tailed mongoose, but the rostrum (front part) is broad and deep, the nasal bones are broad and short, and {{the region of the}} palate is broad.

5|$|A {{pathology}} {{has been}} identified on the tail of Apatosaurus, caused by a growth defect. Two caudal vertebrae are seamlessly fused along the entire articulating surface <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone,</b> including the arches of the neural spines. This defect might {{have been caused by}} the lack or inhibition of the substance that forms intervertebral disks or joints. It has been proposed that the whips could have been used in combat, but the tails of diplodocids were quite light and narrow compared to Shunosaurus and mamenchisaurids, and thus to injure another animal with the tail would severely injure the tail itself.|$|E
5|$|A scapula (shoulder blade), only {{tentatively}} {{assigned to}} Plesiorycteropus, has the acromion, a process, present, but {{the structure is}} probably not as large as in aardvarks or armadillos. Six humeri have been found; the bone is robust and an entepicondylar foramen {{is present in the}} distal (far) end. There are three examples of the radius, a compact and massive bone in Plesiorycteropus which resembles the pangolin radius. The three known ulnae show that the olecranon process at the proximal (near) end is well-developed, but the distal end is narrow; the morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> suggests that the animal was capable of producing much force with its arms.|$|E
5|$|A small parrot ulna {{found on}} the Folle Anse archaeological site on Marie-Galante, {{an island in the}} Guadeloupe region, was {{assigned}} to the Lesser Antillean macaw by the ornithologists Matthew Williams and David Steadman in 2001.

The size and robustness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> was similar to ulnae of the imperial amazon, and though it was worn, the authors identified {{what appeared to be a}} notch, which is also present on ulnae of the genus Amazona, but not in the genus Ara. Subfossil remains from the island of Montserrat have also been suggested to belong to the Lesser Antillean macaw. The species was recognized by Birdlife International and the IUCN Red List until 2013, but was not considered valid thereafter.|$|E

5|$|Allosaurus is {{regarded}} as senior synonym of the genera Creosaurus, Epanterias, and Labrosaurus. Most of the species that are regarded as synonyms of A. fragilis, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is Labrosaurus ferox, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> was due to plaster reconstruction. It is now regarded as an example of A. fragilis.|$|E
5|$|At the back, the nasals are {{separated}} by the frontal in K. langenbergensis, the back third of which is somewhat vaulted.

The prefrontal is straight along its contact with the frontal and nasal (about half <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> is in contact with each), but forms an angle between the margin of the eye socket and the lacrimal on the other side. This angle is rounded in K. guimarotae such that the bone is oval-shaped, but very pointed in K. langenbergensis such that the bone is triangular.|$|E
