30|$|Flow {{assurance}} {{is one of}} {{the core}} issues in safe and economical operation <b>of</b> waxy <b>crude</b> pipelines. Its essence lies in flow and heat transfer <b>of</b> the <b>crude.</b> In the past 10 years, the authors’ team has achieved a lot of innovative results in aspects <b>of</b> waxy <b>crude</b> rheology, flow assurance assessment, and pipelining technologies on the basis of decades of studies. The rheological characteristics <b>of</b> waxy <b>crude</b> are much better understood, and a method for quantitatively simulating the effect of flow shear was developed based on some theoretical breakthroughs. Studies of the mechanism <b>of</b> waxy <b>crude</b> rheology have been deepened to the quantitative level. After successful development of efficient numerical-algorithms, accurate simulations have been achieved for various complex flow and heat transfer situations in waxy crude pipelining, and a reliability-based approach to flow assurance assessment has been set up. New pipelining technologies have been developed such as batching pour-point depressant-(PPD-) treated multiple-waxy-crudes, intermittent transport <b>of</b> waxy <b>crudes</b> through long-distance pipelines, and batching hot and cold crudes. By their application, a series of problems hindering safe, efficient and flexible operation <b>of</b> waxy <b>crude</b> pipelines were tackled, demonstrating that transportation technologies for waxy crude have advanced to a new and high level.|$|R

5|$|Vanadium is {{also present}} in bauxite and in {{deposits}} <b>of</b> <b>crude</b> oil, coal, oil shale and tar sands. In crude oil, concentrations up to 1200ppm have been reported.

5|$|Diffusion <b>of</b> <b>crude</b> {{natural gas}} through special {{semipermeable}} membranes and other barriers is another method {{to recover and}} purify helium.

At rates of use at that time (72 million SCM {{per year in the}} U.S.; see pie chart below) this would have been enough helium for about 58 years of U.S. use, and less than this (perhaps 80% of the time) at world use rates, although factors in saving and processing impact effective reserve numbers.|$|E

However, the industry has also been subject to criticism due to {{the environmental impacts of}} bitumen exploitation. While the industry has attempted to resolve these issues by developing new techniques, such as in situ extraction, environmental organizations, such as Greenpeace, have launched campaigns to delegitimize the resource, based on its greenhouse gas emission records.|$|E

At Tikal, where a great quantity of graffiti has been recorded, the subject matter includes drawings of temples, people, deities, animals, banners, litters, and thrones. Graffiti was often inscribed haphazardly, with drawings overlapping each other, and display a mix <b>of</b> <b>crude,</b> untrained art, and examples by artists who were familiar with Classic-period artistic conventions.|$|E

30|$|Acid {{number is}} a measure of the amount of acidic {{components}} present in a crude oil. It is expressed as the milligrams of KOH that is required to neutralize 1 gm of oil sample. In alkaline flooding, in-situ soap is generated by the reaction of alkali agents such as sodium carbonate with acids in crude oil. For a reservoir to be a good candidate for alkaline flooding, the acid number <b>of</b> the <b>crude</b> oil should be at least 0.5  mg/g. Crude oils with acid number greater than 0.5  mg KOH/g are known as acidic crudes (Ramirez-Corredores 2017). The acid numbers <b>of</b> the <b>crude</b> oil samples were above 0.5  mg KOH/g, indicating acidic nature <b>of</b> the <b>crudes.</b> Based on the above preliminary assessment <b>of</b> the <b>crudes,</b> the oil field was found to be suitable for the application of CO 2 and ASAG flooding.|$|R

Before the boom, the University of Texas consisted of a small number <b>of</b> <b>crude</b> buildings near Austin.

40|$|Crude oil markets witness growing {{disparity}} between the quality <b>of</b> <b>crudes</b> supplied and demanded in the market. The market share <b>of</b> low-quality <b>crudes</b> is increasing due to the depletion of old fields and increasing demand. This is unnerving the practitioners and affecting {{the relevance of the}} traditional benchmark crudes {{due to the lack of}} lower quality benchmarks (Montepeque, 2005). In this article, we apply Granger causality tests to study the price dependence <b>of</b> 32 <b>crudes</b> in order to establish which crudes drive other prices and which ones simply follow general market trends. Our results indicate that some of the old benchmarks are still relevant while others can be disregarded. Our results also interestingly show that the low-quality Mediterranean Russian Urals crude, introduced in the late 1990 s, has emerged recently as a significant driver of global prices. ...|$|R

40|$|High {{crude oil}} prices and the {{eventual}} decline of conventional oil production {{raise the issue of}} alternative fuels such as non- conventional oil. The paper describes a simple probabilistic model of the costs <b>of</b> synthetic <b>crude</b> oil (SCO) produced from Canadian oil sands. Synthetic crude oil is obtained by upgrading bitumen that is first produced through mining or in-situ recovery techniques. This forward looking analysis quantifies the effects of learning and production constraints on the costs <b>of</b> supplying synthetic <b>crude</b> oil from Canadian bitumen deposits. The results show the uncertainties associated with the future costs <b>of</b> synthetic <b>crude</b> oil. Carbon costs have a large impact of the total costs <b>of</b> synthetic <b>crude</b> oil, in particular in the case <b>of</b> synthetic <b>crude</b> oil from in-situ bitumen, due to the carbon intensity of the recovery techniques. The influence of each parameter on the supply costs is examined. In the case of mined SCO, the maximum production rate, the ultimate recovery rate and the depletion parameters show the largest influence on the results, while learning parameters dominate in the case of in-situ SCO...|$|R
5|$|With {{crude oil}} as the country's primary export, Gaddafi sought to improve Libya's oil sector. In October 1969, he proclaimed the current trade terms unfair, benefiting foreign {{corporations}} {{more than the}} Libyan state, and by threatening to reduce production, in December Jalloud successfully increased the price of Libyan oil. In 1970, other OPEC states followed suit, leading to a global increase in the price <b>of</b> <b>crude</b> oil. The RCC followed with the Tripoli Agreement, in which they secured income tax, back-payments and better pricing from the oil corporations; these measures brought Libya an estimated $1 billion in additional revenues in its first year.|$|E

The problem was made worse as 50 tankers {{had been sent to}} help the UK earlier in 1941.

The high levels of protein and fibre (which are comparable to values found in meat and vegetables, respectively) suggest that the egg form of P.indusiatus is a good food source. The concentration of several mineral elements, including potassium, sodium, and iron, was also favourable compared to fruits and vegetables, although the mineral composition in the fungus is dependent on their corresponding concentrations in the soil in which they grow.|$|E
