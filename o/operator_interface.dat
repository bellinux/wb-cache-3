Another abbreviation is HCI, but is more commonly used for human-computer interaction. Other terms used are <b>operator</b> <b>interface</b> console (OIC) and <b>operator</b> <b>interface</b> terminal (OIT).

40|$|Experience {{in recent}} {{conflicts}} indicates {{the employment of}} Unmanned Vehicle Systems (UVS) {{will continue to grow}} in coming years. New UVS capabilities involve greater complexity of payloads and interactions within unmanned vehicle (UV) subsystems, among UVS and between UVS and other systems, including Command and Control (C 2) systems. This introduces additional requirements for UV operators. In some situations UV operators easily can be faced with cognitive information overload, while increasing UVS complexity and future concepts of employment such as single-operator multiple-UV operation require increased operator attention. In order to attain the required level of operator efficiency, it is necessary to introduce higher levels of autonomy within the UVS subsystems in conjunction with the use of intelligent <b>operator</b> <b>interfaces.</b> This will allow for greater flexibility and effectiveness in supporting future mission requirements wherein UVS <b>operator</b> <b>interfaces</b> are able to reduce the work load, and allow operators to function at higher levels of abstraction.

40|$|Abstractâ€”Present {{generation}} AUVs act as mobile sensor platforms, allowing post mission debriefs {{which require}} {{little more than}} an adequate expression of the collected data, and only basic requirements for mission planning. As the need and capability advances, autonomy will increase in turn, leading to more complex missions, which must be supported by more capable <b>operator</b> <b>interfaces,</b> both for post mission debrief and pre-mission verification, lest a deficit of trust form between the vehicles and their operators. We present Glaykos, a system designed to automatically create audio visual debriefs for missions carried out with both real and simulated vehicles, allowing it to act as a tool for both pre-mission verification and post mission debrief. A series of data transforms are applied to the domain information and mission logs from an AUV mission, resulting in the creation of an audio visual debrief whose structure is informed by principles of human computer interaction and narrative. The approach is tested for effectiveness and results of this are presented, showing that it better able to keep users informed when compared two other debriefing strategies, one of which mimics {{the current state of the}} art. Conclusions are drawn regarding the systemâ€™s monologue based approach acting as a first step towards more complex and capable multimodal, dialogue based <b>operator</b> <b>interfaces</b> for autonomous systems.
