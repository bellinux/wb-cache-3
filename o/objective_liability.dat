40|$|The {{relationship}} between environmental public law and environmental private law is {{of a growing}} significance. Not only environmental criminal law {{has an effect on}} environmental private law, but, {{since the beginning of the}} new legal, economic and political era in 1989, private law elements are also to be found in the environmental administrative law. The reciprocity between environmental private and administrative law is clear-cut. Private law institutions, like injunction or deposit, are upheld in environmental administrative contracts. The effect of an administrative ruling has legal consequences in the {{relationship between}}, e. g., neighbors: there are cases in which a noisy neighbor can be brought before the public administration. The <b>objective</b> <b>liability</b> in the field of environmental private law is accepted by the courts and by the citizens. The level of objectivity may, though, vary from country to country. In the practice of the Hungarian environmental private law, after 3 years, the <b>objective</b> <b>liability</b> is subrogated by a subjective liability, this latter one making exculpation easier. The res ipsa loquitur liability in space law is not an absolute liability, though it establishes a praesumptio juris that the environmental damage caused by a space object (e. g. a satellite) is to be covered by the state which has sent the satellite into space. The presumption is, though not easily, rebuttable. In the Hungarian case law, objective environmental liability has been applied sub judice since the novella of the Civil Code in 1977. This novella made environmental private law a part of environmental law. The novella of the Civil Code was preceded by the Act on Environmental Protection of 1976. The importance of economics in environmental private law has only recently been accepted by the Hungarian legal science. The role of the Coase theory is indisputable. The environmental private law is quite a new phenomenon in the Hungarian legal science, however, the institution of neighborhood damage has been present in the Hungarian case law since the 19 th century. The case law added two systems of sanctioning to the disposition of the neighborhood norm in the Hungarian Civil Code: the indemnity and the protection of possession...|$|E
40|$|Constituição Federal de 1988 é um divisor de águas ao assumir-se como Constituição Ambiental, provocando uma ruptura em relação ao conceito de responsabilidade civil. Partindo de uma abordagem qualitativa, dialética e jurisprudencial, este artigo analisa o Princípio Responsabilidade desenvolvido por hans jonas e realiza um diálogo com o instituto da responsabilidade civil ambiental, identificando, com apoio na legislação constitucional e infraconstitucional, as controvérsias doutrinárias acerca da natureza da responsabilidade estatal (objetiva ou subjetiva) frente a casos de omissão da administração pública e à ocorrência de dano ambiental. Conclui-se que o Superior Tribunal de Justiça assume uma dimensão mais alargada do conceito de responsabilidade civil do Estado, demonstrando uma tendência pela responsabilidade civil objetiva com base no risco. Assim, o Brasil, salvo algumas divergências doutrinárias, adota a responsabilidade civil objetiva do Estado pela teoria do risco administrativo alicerçada no ato ilícito e na aceitação do risco. The Federal Constitution of 1988 is a 'water divisor' {{since it}} assumes {{the role of}} Environmental Constitution, causing a rapture {{of the concept of}} civil liability.

It is possible to conclude that the Higher Court of Justice assumes a larger dimension of the civil liability of the State, thus showing the tendency towards the <b>objective</b> civil <b>liability</b> based on the risk.

40|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{criminal law}} accepts {{the system of}} subjective criminal liability for a committed crime, numerous European legal documents as well as criminal laws, especially {{those that have been}} adopted lately, envisage exceptions from this system. Thus, a new form of criminal liability is being introduced: <b>objective</b> <b>liability</b> based on the causation. One of the forms of <b>objective</b> <b>liability</b> is the criminal liability of legal entities, which has been considered disputable for a long time. Obviously, legal entities cannot be held accountable for all types of criminal offences. They cannot be held liable on the grounds of legal provisions regarding mental competence and culpability (as the elements of subjective criminal liability), nor can they be imposed all types of criminal sanctions recognized in criminal legislation in general. In their new or revised criminal legislation, many countries have recognized and inagurated the objective criminal liability of legal persons for committed criminal offences alongside with the predominant system of subjective liability (based on the perpetrator's mental competence and culpability). It is indisputable that some legal entities (such as state authorities) cannot be prosecuted and held liable in criminal proceedings; consequently, there are some exemptions from criminal liability (particularly {{when it comes to the}} state and state bodies), but it does not exclude criminal liability of responsible officials (natural persons) for causing the consequences of a criminal offence. Due to the specific character of legal and contractual capacity of legal entities, law in general and criminal legislations in particular prescribe special legal grounds for establishing criminal liability of legal entities, which differ from the subjective liability of a natural person (perceived as a conscious and reasonable human being acting on his/her own free will) where the consequence of a criminal offence is a result of one's own conduct embodied either in the commission of a criminal offence or in the omission to act. Therefore, contemporary criminal laws have determined special types of criminal sanctions, such as: punishment, security measures, conditional (suspended) sentence and confiscation of material gain obtained by comitting the criminal offence, as well as the instruments, proceedings and conditions under which they may be imposed. Within the framework of the forthcoming reform of the entire penal legislation in the Republic of Serbia, the Serbian legislator may use the legal solutions envisaged in the analyzed documents and criminal legislations as a solid model for implementing the international standards in the field of criminal liability of legal entities. Hence, this paper discusses the particularities governing the application of criminal sanctions for legal entities in the Republic of Serbia, particularly as an instrument of crime control...|$|E

40|$|Nosocomial {{infection}} is notoriously {{one of the}} primary problems faced by healthcare insti-tutions and by professionals who work for them. This fact is demonstrated by the growing number of legal actions proposed in the legal system by patients and users of the health care system. Because of this scenario, the phenomenon of civil liability has arisen in cases of noso-comial infection. The legal implications of this phenomenon are varied and involve issues of the institutional environment and of professional conduct. Thus, the current study seeks to analyze the literature on the decisions taken by Brazilian courts regarding civil liability in cases of nosocomial infection. Conceptual aspects that define this healthcare problem are listed, as are the types of civil liability, the legal directives that guide conduct regarding this topic, and the decisions of Brazilian courts that consider civil liability in these cases.

The study outlines a particularly aggravated liability. On the one hand, the Court of Justice of the European Union clearly declares that the liability for the violation of rules on the procedures for the award of public contracts must leave out of consideration the guilt requisite, thus turning it into an <b>objective</b> <b>liability.</b> On the other hand, the Court of Cassation recognises the possibility to compensation for damages also to the enterprises to which unlawful procedures for the award of public contracts have been annulled, since the P. A. has violated the general behaviour duties, such as skilfulness, prudence, diligence, as well as correctness, advancing that in such cases the sphere of jurisdiction lies with ordinary courts. However, the legal assessment of the Supreme Court on jurisdiction cannot be shared, since – without considering the rest – it seems that an irreconcilable contrast occurs with the rules of the Code of Administrative Process on exclusive jurisdiction of the administrative courts and compensation for damage.

40|$|O presente estudo tem por finalidade a análise das hipóteses objetivas de responsabilidade civil processual existentes no Código de Processo Civil. O tema abordado é dos mais atuais e relevantes, sendo, ainda, dos menos versados pela doutrina pátria, o que justifica a necessidade de maior aprofundamento na questão. A abordagem da matéria tem início pelos aspectos mais relevantes da responsabilidade civil, em seu viés genérico. A responsabilidade civil trata-se de tema que interessa a todos os ramos do direito, posto que, em regra, ao gerar prejuízo para outrem, no desempenho de qualquer atividade, estar-se-á diante da obrigação indenizatória. Ato contínuo, passa-se à análise do instituto quando o dano for causado por atividade processual. O processo, nesse contexto, configura-se unicamente no meio pelo qual o prejuízo a outrem é concretizado. Somente após estarem fixadas referidas premissas, são analisadas as hipóteses de responsabilidade objetiva constantes do Código de Processo Civil brasileiro. Para a realização deste estudo, aliou-se a análise de autores pátrios com estrangeiros, de forma a buscar o que de mais atualizado existe sobre a matéria em questão. Como não poderia ser, sempre se buscou corroborar as posições defendidas com jurisprudência dos tribunais brasileiros, demonstrando, pois, a atualidade do tema versado. É objetivo do presente estudo, portanto, uma sistematização da matéria concernente à responsabilidade processual objetivaThe {{purpose of}} this present study is the {{analysis}} of objective hypotheses of the civil liability proceeding existing in the Code of Civil Procedure. The addressed topic {{is one of the}} most current and relevant ones, and also the least versed by Brazil s doctrine, which justifies the necessity of further clarification on the issue. The approach of this topic begins by the relevant aspects of liability and its general bias. Civil liability is a subject that concerns all branches of law, since as a rule, by generating damage to another person in the performance of any activity one will be faced with the obligation of compensation. Immediately thereafter, civil liability is analyzed when the damage is caused by procedural activity. The process, in this context, is formed solely on the means by which the loss is carried to another. Only after the referred to assumptions are set, then the hypotheses of <b>objective</b> <b>liability</b> in the Code of Civil Procedure in Brazil are analyzed. For the accomplishment of this study, the analysis of patriotic authors came together with foreigners, in a way to seek the most upgraded information on this matter.

40|$|O presente estudo aborda o acidente do trabalho e sua reparação pelo direito comum em face dos dois principais sistemas que fundamentam a responsabilização civil do empregador por acidentes do trabalho - subjetivo e objetivo -, principalmente após a entrada em vigor do novel Código Civil brasileiro, o qual, a despeito de ter mantido como regra geral, no caput do seu artigo 927, a responsabilidade subjetiva, estabeleceu, no parágrafo único desse mesmo dispositivo, concomitantemente, regime especial de responsabilidade objetiva nas hipóteses especificadas em lei ou na hipótese de a atividade normalmente desenvolvida pelo autor do dano implicar, por sua natureza, risco para os direitos de outrem. Se há a compreensão imediata da primeira parte do parágrafo único do artigo em comento, na segunda, as hipóteses de risco são dadas sob a forma de cláusula geral, cabendo ao intérprete a tarefa de preencher a lacuna legal. Essa é uma tarefa que deve ser executada à luz da Constituição Federal brasileira, que prevê, em seu artigo 7 º, inciso XXVIII, a responsabilidade do empregador por culpa ou dolo. Assim, na questão acidente do trabalho, a presente tese demonstra que a teoria do risco tem avançado cada vez mais sobre o terreno da responsabilidade subjetiva, sem, contudo, ter transformado a responsabilidade objetiva em regra geral incidente a partir de simples avaliação circunstancial de um dano verificado na relação de trabalho. Concluiu-se que as atividades que justifiquem a aplicação de uma responsabilidade especial dependem, na análise do caso concreto, antes da apreciação do mérito, de uma decisão {{judicial}} de natureza declaratória nesse sentido, representando valioso instrumento para a reparação dos danos ocorridos em atividades de risco não capituladas em lei. The {{present study}} is concerned with labor-related accidents and their reparations through {{the normal course of}} law, taking into consideration the two main systems on which the employers civil liability is based - subjective and objective -, especially after the new Brazilian Civil Code came into force, which, in spite of the general rule of subjective liability being upheld in the caput of article 937, established in the single paragraph of this same article a special regimen of <b>objective</b> <b>liability</b> on the basis of hypotheses specified in law or on the hypothesis that the activity normally undertaken by the author of damages incurred implies by its very nature in risk to the rights of others. If {{the first part of the}} single paragraph of the article under discussion may be immediately comprehended, in the second part, the hypotheses are presented as a general rule, thus leaving the task of filling this legal interpretation gap in the hands of the person making the interpretation. This is a task which should be undertaken in the light of the Brazilian Federal Constitution, which, in article 7 th subparagraph XXVIII, recognizes the liability of the employer by blame or intention. Thus with regard to labor-related accidents, the present thesis demonstrates that the theory of risk has increasingly advanced into the territory of subjective liability, without however turning <b>objective</b> <b>liability</b> into a general prevailing rule when undertaking circumstantial assessment of damages incurred as a result of work. It is concluded that activities which justify the application of special liability depend, where a concrete case is analyzed and before final judgment is passed, on a judicial declaration for this, and this represents a valuable instrument for reparation of damages incurred in activities of risk not covered by the law...|$|E
40|$|The {{liability}} for defective products {{was for the}} first time introduced in 1994 by the new Civil Code. It widely reflects the liability regime provided by Directive 85 / 374 on product liability. In order to analyse the Albanian system on product liability as a special regime of extra-contractual liability, one should look at the Product Liability Directive, which is the source of inspiration for the Albanian regulation. Before the adoption of the Civil Code in 1994, no special regime of liability existed for the defective products due to the special features of economic and social order, based on centralised economy, on state property on the means of production, social and health insurance for all citizens and medical services provided by the state. The new regulation incorporated into the torts chapter of the Civil Code is not a full transposition of Product Liability Directive. However, it is considered as sufficient for the transposition duties of Albania under Stabilization and Association Agreement. When the Albanian legislator transposed a series of European directives on consumer protection, by adopting a separated legal act, Consumer Protection Law, it was assumed that this special area of tort did not need any amendment to bring it into consistency with the new regime of consumer protection and fully compatible with the Product Liability Directive. Considering the difficulties of law enforcement in South East European countries, this discussion paper aims at drawing a comparison between the European regime and the Albanian one so as to explain the specific features of the <b>objective</b> <b>liability</b> regime and identify the deficiencies in transposition, considering that the Product Liability Directive requires maximum harmonisation...|$|E

Although consumer expectations cannot serve as a workable, stand-alone test for defective design (except in the important subset of design cases involving product malfunctions) the authors acknowledge the relevance of reasonable consumer expectations in a sensible risk-utility analysis. The authors close with a description of the Habush Amendment, included in section 2, which imposes the reasonable alternative design requirement.

40|$|According to {{the current}} {{legislation}} in the Labour Code the employer’s liability for personal injury resulting from industrial injury or disease is <b>objective,</b> i. e. <b>liability</b> for result. Employer has always an obligation to pay damages if the employer has not liberated himself from no-fault liability. In terms which are explicitly defined by the Labour Code the employer can relieved from fully liability or in part. The injured party is entitled to compensation for loss of earnings and compensation for pain and diminished social capability, and compensation for reasonably incurred expenses related to medical treatment and compensation for damage. Additional compensation is provided {{in the case of}} an employee’s death which occurred due to an industrial injury or occupational disease. This may be compensation for reasonable funeral expenses, reimbursement for dependent survivors, one- off compensation for dependents and damage compensation.

Employers will pay premiums to the Czech Social Security Administration, who will pay allowances from the accident insurance directly to the injured employees.

40|$|Born in the {{aftermath}} of the Second World War, the doctrine of command or superior responsibility provides that a military commander or a civilian leader may be held criminally responsible in relation to crimes committed by subordinates even where he has taken no direct or personal part in the commission of these crimes. The basis of this type of liability lies in a grave and culpable failure on the part of a superior to fulfill his duty to prevent or punish crimes of subordinates. Command responsibility is not a form of <b>objective</b> <b>liability,</b> nor is it a form of accomplice liability although it borrows elements from various types and forms of liability. It is a form of liability that is personal in nature and which is triggered by a personal and culpable dereliction of duty. Liability is entailed, however, not for a specific crime of 'dereliction of duty', but instead in relation to the underlying offence that has been committed by subordinates of the superior. In that sense, the responsibility of a superior is entailed and is closely linked to the crimes of his subordinates for which he may be convicted. Contrary to most other forms of criminal liability, the doctrine of command responsibility first developed as a norm of international law, rather than under domestic law. It is central to the ability of international law to ensure compliance with standards of humanitarian law and it remains a most important legal instrument in the fight against impunity. The present thesis provides a comprehensive and insightful dissection of that doctrine, its scope of application, its elements as well as the evidential difficulties involved in establishing those elements in the context of criminal prosecutions...|$|E
40|$|The {{profound}} {{transformation of}} the Romanian society and the contemporary European realities imposed the adaptation {{of the rule of}} civil law to meet the new cultural, economic, scientific and socio-moral values. Expected with great enthusiasm, or on the contrary with skepticism, the emergence of the current Civil Code and its enforcement on 1 October 2011 sparked lively debates in the legal world. Regarded as a modern tool to regulate fundamental aspects of the individual and social existence, adapted to modern terminology, the current Civil Code is, after the Romanian Constitution, the most important normative act, both in extent and in terms of content, regulating the human relations even before the birth of the person, as owner of rights and obligations, and until after death. Our research has set an objective: the study of the current liability regulations regarding the institution of civil liability in general and tort liability, in particular. In our assessment, the institution of tort liability finds itself in a thorough transformation {{to meet the needs of}} the modern society. On these coordinates, the current Civil Code reaffirms the idea of subjective liability conditioned by proving the fault of the responsible person. However, countless law assumptions of <b>objective</b> <b>liability,</b> independent of any guilt, were regulated in the positive law. In doctrine we discuss the possibility of interpreting the “guilt” from an objective position: the abnormality of the offender’s behavior and, in a lesser extent, the imputability of his deed. We appreciate that the main objective of tort liability must be to support the interests of innocent victims. In this way, we consider the possible transfer of the legal, ethical and moral debates, from the subjective level to the objective level, respectively regarding the act causing the harm, as the defining element of tort liabilitytort liability, Romanian Civil Code, guilt, imputability...|$|E
40|$|O presente estudo tem o objetivo de discorrer sobre a responsabilidade civil do administrador de sociedade anônima, destacar os posicionamentos doutrinário e jurisprudencial sobre o tema em espécie, bem como demonstrar a modalidade de responsabilidade civil a ser aplicada para a hipótese de o administrador de S/A que desrespeita o preceito estabelecido no art. 158, II, da Lei 6. 404 / 76. A justificativa para este estudo existe porque o mencionado dispositivo legal não evidencia qual o sistema de responsabilidade civil se aplica à espécie. Prova disto é que se trata de tema bastante tormentoso na doutrina e que, apenas recentemente, passou a ser encarado pelos Tribunais. Em relação às hipóteses suscitadas neste trabalho, nota-se que uma parte da {{literatura}} especializada entende que a hipótese legal específica do tema estudado cuida de responsabilidade civil objetiva. Outra parcela, em posição oposta à primeira, assegura que a responsabilidade do administrador, em tais casos, é subjetiva com inversão do ônus da prova. Há, ainda, uma terceira corrente, antagônica às anteriores, que sustenta a aplicação da responsabilidade civil subjetiva clássica ao administrador que agir com violação da lei ou do estatuto. Daí porque se faz necessário um estudo aprofundado da matéria, a fim de definir, com precisão, qual a modalidade de responsabilidade civil aplicada à hipótese proposta neste trabalho. O resultado da pesquisa, após a utilização de metodologia científica dedutiva, aponta que a responsabilidade civil subjetiva clássica é a modalidade de responsabilidade civil a ser aplicada ao administrador da companhia para o caso de ofensa ao artigo 158, II, da Lei 6. 404 / 76 This study aims {{to discuss}} the liability of the corporation administrator, highlight the doctrinal and jurisprudential positions on the issue, as well as demonstrate the liability method to be applied in case that the Anonymous Society administrator disrespects the rule laid down in Article 158, II, of Law 6. 404 / 76. The rationale for this study exists because of the aforementioned legal provision does not show which liability system applies to the case. Proof {{of this is that}} the subject is quite a stormy theme in doctrine and that only recently has begun to be viewed by the courts. Regarding the hypotheses raised in this paper, it is noted that part of the literature considers that the specific legal hypothesis of the study theme takes care of <b>objective</b> <b>liability.</b> Another portion arranged opposite to the first, says the administrator liability in such cases is subjective by reversing the burden of proof. There is also a third current, antagonistic to the above, which supports the application of classical subjective liability to the administrator that acts in breach of any law or statute. That is why a thorough study of the matter is necessary in order to define, with precision, what the is legal nature applied to the hypothesis proposed in this paper. The search result after the use of deductive scientific methodology indicates that classical subjective liability is the liability method to apply to the administrator of the company in case of offense to Article 158, II, of Law 6. 404 / 7...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{criminal}} law doctrines that evade the 'doctrine of conjunction' the precondition for culpability that the commission of a prohibited act be proven as accompanied by the intention to achieve the unlawful consequence. In general, they do so by ignoring, presuming, imputing or fictionally creating either actus reus or mens rea. This thesis contends that these are techniques which are deliberately constructed to manage incidental harm and which, together with the inchoate or anticipatory offences, form a patchwork of methods to supervise the citizen's choices to inflict risks. It further argues that, by artificially converting secondary or incidental intention into malice, the doctrines disguise that modern criminal law has fate-management as its primary focus. The thesis illustrates that there are significant gaps in this regime. For instance, the inchoate offences can generally only address direct intention, and the outcome-based prohibitions cannot intercept fate. The thesis also maintains that fictions such as <b>objective</b> and constructive <b>liability</b> offend the rule of law, in that they modify fact rather than place values on it. The work suggests that current criminal law is an interim step towards a fully subjective fate-managing law. It proposes a radical revision to the existing approach: that the core criminal offence be 'conscious disproportionate endangerment of the legal rights of others'...|$|R
40|$|Background: Nosocomial infections {{represent}} {{not only}} a problem for public health – according to data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) 4. 1 million patients in Europe suffer from hospital infections every year – {{but they also have}} important legal implications. The Authors analyse this subject in the light of recent judgments that have introduced new elements of <b>objective</b> public <b>liability</b> at a civil level with debasement of the causal link assessment and reversal of the burden of proof on physicians. Consequently, there has been a tightening of judgments that, being increasingly aimed at protecting health, are often in favour of patients. Therefore we are witnessing the progressive weakening of the legal protection of physicians. Objectives: With this work the Authors, starting from the problems that emerged in recent judgments, point out the judiciary attitude of being increasingly {{on the side of the}} patient that is identified as the "weak subject". They identify possible solutions inspired by the experience of management of medical errors in some European countries, such as the "no fault" system of the Scandinavian countries or the social insurance system in force in France. This system provides for the introduction of forms of social insurance mandatory for public structures, allowing physicians not to take any direct and personal responsibility in case of an error with the user-patient; indeed, in this case it is the latter who has the burden of proving the faute (error). Material and Methods: This research is based on recent judgments of the Civil Cassation Court and the current increase in litigation that the National Health System is facing, due also to media influence. The Authors illustrate how European countries, through social security systems and mediation, try to control the problem and protect the physician. Results and Conclusion: Finally, the Authors point out that the current increase in litigation along with a progressively more favourable attitude towards the patient, has fostered attitudes of defensive medicine by the physician who has felt more and more defenceless. It is to be hoped that a final regulatory framework that establishes forms of protection for physicians will be achieved, in order to give the best treatment to patients. This should, at the same time, avoid the adoption of defensive behaviour by the physician to reduce the risk of cases involving professional responsibility. Therefore, the Authors suggest the possibility of using new legal means inspired by the European experience...|$|R

40|$|March 2 nd, 2012. A Committee was {{appointed}} by Royal Decree to conduct {{a review of the}} Norwegian pilot service and regulations. The Committee was composed by various interest groups involved with the pilot service, and was headed by Bjørn Solbakken, Chief Justice of Gulating Court of Appeal. One of the topics that were discussed by the Committee was the liability for the Norwegian State pilots. In 1969 the Tort Liability Act (Skl.) was passed with a provision, § 2 - 1, which imposed an <b>objective</b> <b>liability</b> for an employer. This was the first clear provision to regulate employer liability for both public and private entities. In 1989 a new Pilotage Act was passed. This Act contained an exception rule, the Pilotage Act § 24, which legislated that a State pilot, with regard to Skl. § 2 - 1, is considered to be in the service of a ship during pilotage. The general employer liability stipulated in Skl. § 2 - 1 is thus transferred from the State to the shipowner during pilotage. The consequence of the exception rule is that the State, as the pilots employer, is exempt from liability when a State pilot negligently or intentionally causes damage during pilotage. In the preparatory works of the Pilotage Act (Ot. prp. nr. 43 (1988 - 1989)) the Ministry of Justice claimed that § 24 would entail an enactment of legal practice. The Ministry referred to a Supreme Court case from 1963, Rt. 1963. 622 Prince Charles, where a shipowner was held liable when two State pilots negligently caused damage during pilotage. The main legal basis for the Pilotage Act § 24 therefore originates from 1963; a time before the Tort Liability Act and the general employer liability rule. The Norwegian Shipowners Association (NSA), which represents the main users of the pilot service, believes {{that it is time to}} change the current state of law. It is not reasonable that the shipowners bear the full liability for damages caused by the State pilots negligence in service. The NSA claims that the Pilotage Act § 24 is outdated and lacks relevance today, and that the employer liability for the State pilots does not harmonize with the State s employer liability in other areas of law. According to the NSA, a thorough review of the Pilotage Act § 24 is necessary. A review should also be done in conjunction with the Mari-time Code (MC) § 151, which imposes a vicarious liability for a reder (referred to as shipowner in the following discussions). MC § 151 takes the shipowner s liability one-step further than the general employer liability stipulated in Skl. § 2 - 1. MC § 151 sets no requirements as to a direct employment relationship between the shipowner and the servant for the shipowner to be liable; the only requirement is that work is performed in the service of the ship. The consequence of this provision is that a shipowner in certain situations will be liable for the work performed by someone else employees, e. g. when a pilot, employed by the State, performs work in the service of the ship. June 10 th, 2013. The Committee submitted its Norwegian Official Report (NOU) 2013 : 8 Med los på sjøsikkerhet, office translation With a pilot on maritime safety. The Committee proposed in section 14. 2. 4. 2 that a review of the liability for State pilots should be conducted. April 11 th, 2014. The Ministry of Transport and Communication released its draft resolutions and bills, 65 L (2013 – 2014). The Ministry proposed to retain the current state of law without conducting a thorough analysis of the topic. The objective of this dissertation is to discuss whether there are grounds to consider a modification of the current state of law. The discussion will be based on a presentation of the rules governing the liability for the State pilots and a presentation of the rationale that underlies the current state of the law...|$|E

This {{dissertation}} {{on the environmental}} liability of agriculture first provides information about the circumstances and specific nature of the agriculture as an occupation and as elementary production, {{as well as its}} connection to certain basic human rights, and generally looks at rural law and environmental law and their intertwined relationship in current agricultural policy in addition to the relationship between agri-environmental liabilities and property rights. The study then concentrates on the legislative environmental directing of agricultural activities especially within cultivation and the various relevant principles represented in the agri-environmental sector of law. The last part is comprised of the main results of the study with some de lege ferenda proposals for addressing obvious shortcomings in the efficiency of current agri-environmental legislation. The dissertation adopts a broad concept of agricultural environmental liability that includes both compulsory and voluntary based legal obligations to prevent and minimize pollution, and to compensate for environmental damage or restore contaminated or polluted environments. Elements of the environment subjected to pollution include surface and ground water and soil, as well as air and even climate. Agricultural activities causing pollution are mainly fertilizing, manure spreading and storage, cattle pasturing and the use of pesticides. For watercourses it is mostly a diffuse type of pollution, appearing as eutrophication, and for ground water and soil it is usually point source pollution and contamination. Environmental protection has since 1980 s and 1990 s significantly modified the Common Agricultural Popolicy (CAP) of the EU and its legislation. The CAP was strongly shaped by the Uruguay Round with its WTO Agricultural Agreement, and is still {{under the influence of the}} prolonged Doha Round, which aims to renegotiate that agreement for the further liberalization of trade. The latest reform of the CAP created the Single Payment System (SPS) by Council Regulation (EC) 1782 / 2003, with the aim of decoupling the CAP supports from production. The SPS includes additional aid conditions the purpose of which are to ensure that fields are kept in good condition with regard to the environment and further cultivation. In addition, special agri-environmental supports – also of a voluntary nature, though based on legislation – have alongside LFA aid and special national support allowed to Finland after joining the EU in 1995, played a central role in the national adaptation to the CAP. The compulsory agri-environmental legislation, based on the targets and principles of article 174 of the EC Treaty, is mainly comprised of the measures of Directive 91 / 676 /EEC that concerns the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources. It is implemented nowadays in pursuance to the Environmental Protection Act (86 / 2000, EPA) by Government Decree 931 / 2000, which stipulates that the actions in it, including instructions for good agricultural practices, refer to the Nitrate Directive´s action programme. The programme is being put into effect throughout the country. Finland thus chose to free itself from the obligation to identify specific vulnerable zones in accordance with article 3 (5) article of the directive. The provisions of the Nitrate Decree concern the volume and other conditions for storage of animal manure, and the use of manure and nitrogen fertilizers having seasonal, areal and quantitative restrictions. For instance, animal manure may be applied on a field as fertilizer equivalent to a maximum of 170 kg/ha/year of nitrogen. The use of maximum amounts of nitrogen on fields as fertilizer, contained in mineral fertilizer, animal manure and organic fertilizers, is allowed, for example, as follows: for grassland and pasture, silage and horticultural plants, 250 kg of nitrogen/ha/year (highest); for winter cereals, up to 200 kg of nitrogen/ha/year, of which normally 30 kg are used in the autumn and 170 kg in the spring; and for spring cereals, sugar beet, oilseed crops and other crops, up to 170 kg /ha/year. In addition, Annex 3 of the decree makes some special recommendations on procedures related to the use of animal manure. The Nitrate Directive is now connected to the water policy framework Directive 2000 / 60 /EC (with its planning system and action programmes) which is implemented mainly by the Act on Arrangement of Water Management (1299 / 2004). This system does not hinder the developing and tightening of the rules of the nitrate legislation also separately, if needed. The role of private law measures is restricted in the agricultural sector mainly to the Act of Compensation for Environmental Damage (737 / 1994) and the Adjoining Properties Act (26 / 1920). Both of these are based on <b>objective</b> <b>liability.</b> The principles in the Environmental Protection Act (86 / 2000) are not understood quite in the same way as the environmental principles in article 174 (2) of the treaty. This particularly concerns the principle of caution and care in section 4. 1. 2 of the act compared to the precautionary principle of the treaty with its heavier weight and larger area of application, as conventionally interpreted in the European Court of Justice. Environmental principles, in any case, work very much towards common goals. From a systematic point of view it would be reasonable in Finnish law to combine the principle of prevention together with that principle of caution and care into a larger main principle, a “principle of prevention and precaution”, for instance. The results from agri-environmental measures in Finland have been insufficient. Although the use of nitrogen fertilizing has generally decreased – the average balance of nitrogen in fields been reduced from 80 kg to 50 kg per hectare and the nitrogen flow potential for watercourses has decreased especially in eastern and middle Finland – the least and most insufficient decrease has occured in the coastal areas, where in many rivers and especially in the Archipelago Sea and Gulf of Finland no reductions in the nitrogen load has been found. The reason is due to national circumstances, the overly high maximum amounts of nitrogen fertilizing allowed in the Nitrate Decree, actually already in the Nitrate Directive, and the fact that Finland by choosing to establish and apply the action programme relating to article 5 of the directive throughout its national territory exempted itself from the obligation to identify specific vulnerable zones. Additionally, the Nitrate Directive and Decree do not regulate or directly affect the use of phosphorous fertilizers. Therefore, reaching more concrete results in the protection of watercourses against eutrophication caused by agriculture is left to be managed by the agri-environmental aid scheme, which covers over 90 per cent of all active farms in Finland but has not in this respect been effective enough. Neither the polluter pay- principle and the precautionary principle nor the principle of prevention have sufficiently materialized for Finnish farming in terms of the protection of surface waters. Instead of the polluter pays principle prevails, through the scheme of agri-environmental aid the so-called provider gets principle. On the other hand, the ground water and soil situation is good, thanks to the ground water pollution and soil contamination prohibitions in section 7 and 8 of the EPA, as well as the prohibitions, warnings and measures prescribed for the use of plant protection and bioside products in accordance with the harmonized legislation in these areas. Still, a lack of harmony is noticeable between environmental aid payed on the basis of the “agreements for cultivation of ground water areas” and the groundwater pollution prohibition in the EPA. The recommendations forming part of the Nitrate Decrees regulations should be transformed into regulations. Limits for maximum nitrogen fertilization should be lowered in watercourse zones especially vulnerable to pollution, as well as to those parts of the country from which the heaviest loads still issue into the Archipelago Sea and Gulf of Finland. Conditions for all agri-environmental aid should include more onerous conditions for phosphorous fertilization. The aid should also be based more on agreements tailored and negotiated to fit the activities and special characteristics of each farm. There are also grounds for lowering the limits of livestock installations requiring environmental permits for their establishment or enlargement, and for placing on these permits – in accordance with the principle that damage should as a priority be rectified at the source, and to enhance agricultural structure – the condition of having in one´s possession, by ownership or long-term lease, sufficient field area for the application of manure near enough to the installation. One possible economical measure to alleviate the diffuse pollution into waters could be a payment system that would be based on the arable land area under active cultivation and each farm´s number of livestock and thus on the farm´s estimated yearly surplus balance of nitrogen and phosphorous fertilization. In general, it would be reasonable in terms of achieving a more genuine application of the polluter pays principle and also the principles of prevention and precaution to put more weight on using the compulsory legal measures and additional conditions in the CAP as well as national agri-aid instead of special agri-environmental aid. The trend of rising cereal prices, as well as possible increasing demand for other agricultural products, could help in the adoption of these measures. Agri-environmental aids should in the long run be mainly used temporarily and as an incentive during transitional periods for the implementation and adaptation of new and stricter legal environmental obligations...|$|E
40|$|The nuisance-value {{settlement}} problem arises {{whenever a}} litigant can profitably initiate a meritless claim or defense and {{offer to settle}} it for less than it would cost the opposing litigant to have a court dismiss the claim or defense on a standard motion for merits review like summary judgment. The opposing litigant confronted with such a nuisance-value claim or defense rationally would agree to settle for any amount up {{to the cost of}} litigating to have it dismissed. These settlement payoffs skew litigation outcomes away from socially appropriate levels, undermining the deterrence and compensation <b>objectives</b> of civil <b>liability.</b> Yet current procedural rules are inadequate to foreclose nuisance-value strategies. Class action is commonly thought to exacerbate the nuisance-value settlement problem to the systematic disadvantage of defendants. This concern has contributed to the growing support among courts and commentators for subjecting class actions to precertification merits review (PCMR), generally understood as conditioning class certification on prior screening of class claims for some threshold level of merit. This article proposes mandatory summary judgment (MSJ) as {{a solution to the problem}} of nuisance-value settlement in class actions and in civil litigation generally. Essentially, MSJ denies judicial enforceability to any settlement agreement entered into before the nuisance-value claim or defense has been submitted for merits review on a motion for summary judgment or other standard dispositive motion. Assessing the potential costs of the MSJ solution, we conclude that neither the opportunity for evading MSJ strictures nor the possibility of adding expenses to the settlement of non-nuisance-value litigation outweighs the benefits of MSJ. MSJ will be most cost-effective in the class action context, given the already existing general requirements of judicial review and approval of class action settlements, but MSJ should also prove beneficial in preempting nuisance-value strategies outside of class actions in the standard separate action context. With the MSJ solution set out, the article moves finally to offering a more exhaustive analysis of the theoretical soundness and practical efficacy of MSJ in the class action context, where its marginal benefits are arguable the greatest. First, the article challenges the commonly held belief that class action certification exacerbates the nuisance-value settlement problem, attempting to displace the conventional understanding of complex litigation with a new conceptual framework based on the recharacterization of the class action as part of a continuum of litigation processes rather than an isolated litigation mechanism. Second, the article provides a comparative analysis of MSJ and PCMR as solutions to the nuisance-value problems that do exist in the class action context, concluding that MSJ presents the superior and more cost-effective option...|$|R
