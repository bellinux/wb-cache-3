The movement had many adherents, including Gaganendranath Tagore, Ramkinkar Baij, Jamini Roy, and Rabindranath Tagore. After Indian Independence, important groups such as the Calcutta Group and the Society of Contemporary Artists were formed in Bengal and came to dominate the art scene in India.|$|E

5|$|In 1870, Sartain met Mary Cassatt in Philadelphia and the {{following}} year they left for Paris, London, Parma, and Turin to study painting. The women spent the first winter in Italy and studied printmaking with Carlo Raimondi, who taught engraving at the Academy <b>of</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>in</b> Parma. Sartain {{spent the rest of}} the four-year stay in Paris and studied under Évariste Vital Luminais. She shared a studio with Jeanne Rongier. Florence Esté, Sartain's friend, also worked in the studio occasionally. The women copied each other's work and provided one another criticism and encouragement. Two of Sartain's paintings, genre painting Le Piece de Conviction (The Reproof) and a portrait of Mlle. Del Sarte, were accepted at the Paris salon in 1875. Sartain returned to the United States that year, when she ran out of money. Harriet (Hattie) Judd Sartain, who was her brother Samuel's wife and a successful homeopathic physician, had lent Emily Sartain money for her education. Emily believed Hattie was likely to continue to help with education expenses in Philadelphia where expenses were lower and she would more likely sell her works.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, the Palace <b>of</b> <b>Fine</b> <b>Arts</b> <b>in</b> Brussels held an {{exhibition}} marking {{fifty years of}} The Adventures of Tintin. As part of this, they included artefacts that featured in the series, with the broken-eared Peruvian statue that inspired Hergé's Arumbaya fetish as the centre piece of the show; however, they feared {{that it might be}} stolen, so a replica was exhibited rather than the genuine article. Imitating the events of The Broken Ear, a thief broke in and stole the statue. A letter was then sent to Le Soir in which an individual alleging to be the thief stated that the item would be returned if Hergé returned {{to the scene of the}} crime at a certain time with a copy of the book under his right arm. Hergé did so, but carried the book under his left arm; the thief never appeared, and the replica fetish was never recovered.|$|E
