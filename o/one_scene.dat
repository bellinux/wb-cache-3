5|$|A {{recreation}} of the Body Worlds exhibit {{provided a}} setting for <b>one</b> <b>scene</b> in the film. Among the Body Worlds plastinates featured in that scene were the Poker Playing Trio (which {{plays a key}} role in <b>one</b> <b>scene)</b> and Rearing Horse and Rider. The exhibition's developer and promoter, German anatomist Gunther von Hagens, also has a cameo appearance in the film, although only his trademark hat is actually visible on screen.|$|E
5|$|However, certain goddesses such as Juno, Ceres, Iris, and sea nymphs are in <b>one</b> <b>scene</b> of the play.|$|E
5|$|Frankel {{generally}} {{approved of}} his editor's choices, but differed on <b>one</b> <b>scene,</b> showing more of Andrea on her errand to the Calvin Klein showroom. He felt that scene showed Andrea's job was {{about more than}} running personal errands for Miranda.|$|E

5|$|In <b>one</b> <b>scene,</b> C.J. {{says that}} special {{prosecutor}} Rollins was {{the editor of}} the Yale Law Review. There {{is no such thing as}} the Yale Law Review, though the journal of legal scholarship affiliated with the Yale Law School is called the Yale Law Journal.|$|E
5|$|<b>One</b> <b>scene</b> {{right before}} Riddler and Two-face team up {{featured}} a little conversation with Dick and Bruce {{in the gym}} of the manor. This would explain why Dick suddenly has martial arts training. This scene appears in a rough edit on the Special Edition DVD.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{additional}} profanity, gore, {{and sexual}} content, {{and a few}} extra lines, the extended version features a few extra scenes. In <b>one</b> <b>scene,</b> Berringer blames the Mayor for the witches' attack and murders him in public. The scene where Berringer and his goons assault Gretel is also extended; it occurs in between the scene where Mina heals Hansel and has sex with him, and shows that the men plan to rape Gretel right before Edward kills them.|$|E
50|$|Working titles for {{the film}} were Stingray and The Hot <b>One.</b> <b>Scenes</b> of Kenny's high school were filmed at Burbank High School (Burbank, California) in the San Fernando Valley, and Verdugo Hills High School outside of Los Angeles.|$|R
50|$|The film {{consists}} of over 50 short scenes, usually featuring two characters - occasionally three or just <b>one.</b> <b>Scenes</b> are linked by dissolves featuring falling snow, a device {{similar to one}} which Resnais previously used in L'Amour à mort (1984).|$|R
5|$|In <b>one</b> cutaway <b>scene,</b> W. Frederick Gerhardt's Cycleplane {{crashing}} is parodied.|$|R
5|$|Barney Burman {{supervised}} the makeup {{for the other}} aliens: his team had to rush the creation {{of many of the}} aliens, because originally the majority of them were to feature in <b>one</b> <b>scene</b> towards the end of filming. Abrams deemed the scene too similar to the cantina sequence in Star Wars and decided to dot the designs around the film. A tribble was placed in the background of Scotty's introduction. Both digital and physical makeup was used for aliens.|$|E
5|$|However, in <b>one</b> <b>scene,</b> a Pawnee {{character}} {{is accompanied by}} a voiceover in Inupiak, which is spoken in Arctic Alaska, thousands of kilometers away and a different language family from Pawnee. The voiceover was taken from a John Luther Adams recording; the words originally came from an Inuit woman named Uvavnuk, an angakkuq (shaman) and oral poet.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, American {{cartoonist}} Charles Burns authored X'ed Out, {{a graphic}} novel {{with a variety}} of allusions to The Adventures of Tintin. In <b>one</b> <b>scene,</b> the protagonist Nitnit discovers a warehouse containing white eggs with red spots, akin to the mushrooms in The Shooting Star, with the cover of Burns' book paying homage to Hergé. In 2015, the original front cover sketch of the book was sold for €2.5million to a European investor, Marina David of Petits Papiers-Huberty-Breyne, at the Brussels Antiques and Fine Art Fair.|$|E
50|$|Set in Thrissur, {{the film}} {{displays}} the typical Malayali bachelor lifestyle in many <b>scenes.</b> <b>One</b> such <b>scene</b> where Mohanlal invites Ashokan for a lemonade drink and straight away gets {{in to the}} city bar, has now become iconic call signs for a drink offer between Malayalis.|$|R

5|$|Jokes {{from earlier}} scripts were used. In <b>one</b> <b>scene,</b> Carla Tortelli orders a phone caller to do {{something}} about their unruly children. When one of the bartenders suggests hiring a babysitter, Carla replied that the caller was the babysitter. The cast did not know the ending of the pilot episode during production, since the final draft of the script was dated April 16, 1982.|$|E
5|$|Star Wars: Jedi Arena is a 2D {{overhead}} shooter {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Parker Brothers in 1983 for the Atari 2600.

5|$|The {{episode was}} seen by 7.35 million viewers in the UK and {{achieved}} an Appreciation Index of 85. Reviewers were generally positive about the episode; some praised the setting and characters but others commented that the story had not developed enough {{even though it was}} only the first part. The computer-generated effects used for <b>one</b> <b>scene</b> were also disapproved of by a couple of reviewers.|$|E

25|$|The play is {{set over}} three <b>scenes,</b> <b>one</b> long <b>scene</b> {{covering}} {{the whole of}} the first act, and two shorter scenes in the second act. The three scenes occur over a period of about ten weeks towards the end of Charlie's celebrity career and his sudden descent into obscurity.|$|R
50|$|Angel {{is set in}} Altamount, North Carolina in {{the fall}} of 1916. In Act <b>One,</b> the <b>scene</b> is the Dixieland Boarding House. In Act Two, <b>Scene</b> <b>One</b> is set in Gant's marble yard and shop; and Scenes Two and Three are set again in the Dixieland Boarding House.|$|R
5|$|The filming {{was done}} at two hospitals, the Northwick Park Hospital in Middlesex and the North Hampshire Hospital in Basingstoke. This {{presented}} a problem because the show had to work around the real-life hospitals, with their actual doctors, patients and emergency situations. In <b>one</b> <b>scene</b> in the final episode in series one, Guy (Mangan) was hitting squash balls behind him, and nearly hit a patient. However, some scenes, {{such as those in}} Sue's and Alan's offices, were filmed in a studio.|$|E
5|$|After {{they started}} to break apart, further orders were placed for {{additional}} suits and all the suits used eventually fell apart during the four days they were used on set. In order to film <b>one</b> <b>scene,</b> McChesney wore the suit open-backed due to the damage. No optical effects were used in creating Armus. For the scene where Riker is pulled into the oil, a stuntman {{was used as a}} stand in for Jonathan Frakes. Where Riker's face emerges from the oil, it was actually a plaster cast of Frakes' face painted black. It was placed on the same grate used to lift McChesney, and filmed lifting out of the liquid. The twitching effect in Yar's death was due to a wire tied around Crosby's waist being pulled on.|$|E
5|$|Although sign theft {{has always}} been a problem along this highway, thefts reached {{epidemic}} proportions when the pending number change was announced. Within days of the announcement, virtually every US666 sign had been stolen, some for sale on eBay. Officials in Utah reported that five entire sign assemblies had been cut down with a chainsaw and stolen, while New Mexico officials reported that even signs welded to metal posts, as a theft deterrent, had been stolen. Officials speculated from <b>one</b> <b>scene</b> that someone had intentionally crashed a car into the sign post to break the welds.|$|E

5|$|Because Ratatouille is {{intended}} to be a romantic, lush vision of Paris, giving it an identity distinct from previous Pixar films, director Brad Bird, producer Brad Lewis and some of the crew spent a week in the city to properly understand its environment, taking a motorcycle tour and eating at five top restaurants. There are also many water-based sequences in the film, one of which is set in the sewers and is more complex than the blue whale scene in Finding Nemo. <b>One</b> <b>scene</b> has Linguini wet after jumping into the Seine to fetch Remy. A Pixar employee (Shade/Paint department coordinator Kesten Migdal) jumped into Pixar's swimming pool wearing a chef's uniform and apron to see which parts of the suit stuck to his body and which became translucent from water absorption.|$|E
5|$|Benny Chan {{described}} the filming process {{as some of}} the darkest days of his career, explaining that the baby was a factor beyond his control, and could not work more than eight hours a day. Whenever a scene involving the baby was shot, the crew members had to be silent, communicating in sign language. Benny Chan stated it took time, patience, and money to guide the baby through each shot, and numerous retakes were required due to the baby's constant crying and napping. As a result, production went over budget. Special methods were sometimes used to coax the baby into co-operation. <b>One</b> <b>scene</b> required the baby to suckle Chan's nipple. The baby was initially hesitant, but relented after the crew brushed a large amount of honey onto the nipple.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{was even}} more violent towards women in the gangster film Picture Snatcher (1933): in <b>one</b> <b>scene,</b> he knocks out an amorous woman whose {{feelings}} he does not reciprocate and violently throws her into the backseat of his car. In April 1931, the same month as the release of The Public Enemy, Hays recruited former police chief August Vollmer to conduct {{a study on the}} effect gangster pictures had on children. After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and even overly favorable in depicting the police. Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry, the New York State censorship board was not impressed, and from 1930 through 1932, removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.|$|E
5000|$|In {{response}} to the controversy, Chi Chi LaRue defended the film {{as a work of}} art, praising Blake Riley's performance and claiming that the film was more authentically bisexual than most bisexual porn.“I would say probably the biggest standout in this movie was Blake Riley, who has never been with a girl in his life. Blake fucks Shy and Brittany, and also fucks the lovely Ms. Amber while also getting fucked by Ryan Alexander’s big dick. Delish! I know all the complaints about bi porn in the past. Fans would always complain about how the sex wasn’t authentically bisexual with just <b>one</b> lesbian <b>scene,</b> <b>one</b> gay <b>scene,</b> <b>one</b> straight <b>scene.</b> Sometimes it worked out that way, but this movie is very bisexual. Just wait until you see that huge orgy. Everyone does everything to everyone. They sell and sell and sell. Not huge numbers all at once, but very consistently over time. I was looking at the numbers for my older bi movies like ‘Mile Bi Club’ and ‘Fly Bi Night’ and was really surprised at how many units we’d moved. I knew it was time for another one.” ...|$|R
50|$|Marky {{was one of}} {{the pioneers}} of the EU {{dribbling}} style. During the early months of Rocket League, Marky was an imperious 1v1 player on account of his brutal dribbling ability and his refusal to release ball pressure or allow space for his opponent when defending. More recently however, he is less overbearing over the <b>ones</b> <b>scene,</b> but is still considered one of the top ones players in the world.|$|R
