5|$|As {{with the}} {{preceding}} naval engagements around Guadalcanal, the strategic <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> inconclusive because neither the Japanese nor United States navies secured operational {{control of the}} waters around Guadalcanal {{as a result of}} this action.

5|$|Current Electoral College rules allow a {{candidate}} to win the Presidency while losing the popular vote, as happened in the elections of 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016.

5|$|In the game, coach Mack Brown and his Texas Longhorns beat USC by {{the score}} of 41–38 and ended USC's 34game win streak. The game's <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> still in doubt {{late in the}} fourth quarter, when the Trojans tried to convert a fourth down play that would win the game for them. After they were stopped Young led the Longhorns on a {{touchdown}} drive that was capped by his fourth down rush for the twelveyard touchdown.|$|E
5|$|The {{church was}} shared for worship between the monks of Dunster Priory and the parishioners, however {{this led to}} several {{conflicts}} between them. One <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> the carved rood screen which divided the church in two with the parish using the west chancel and the monks the east. It was restored in 1875–77 by George Edmund Street. The church has a cruciform plan with a central four-stage tower, built in 1443 with diagonal buttresses, a stair turret and single bell-chamber windows.|$|E

A third category of learning <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> the unintended learning outcome which would include beneficial <b>outcomes</b> that <b>were</b> neither planned nor sought but are simply observed.|$|R
5|$|The game's <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> {{in doubt}} {{until the final}} minute of play. With 19seconds left on the game clock, Vince Young ran for a {{touchdown}} and regained the lead for the Longhorns. He followed up by running {{the ball into the}} end zone for a two-point conversion. Leinart had time to attempt one pass but his pass fell out of bounds as time expired; UT beat USC by the score of 41–38.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Conservatives' {{ties to the}} CPR, Rutherford's Liberals {{enjoyed the}} incumbent's {{advantage}} of controlling the levers of patronage, and the election's result was never really in doubt. Before the election, Talbot predicted {{that the government would}} win 18 of the province's 25 seats. Immediately after the election it appeared that the Liberals had won 21; when all the votes had been counted they had won 23 seats to the Conservatives' two. Bennett himself was defeated in his Calgary riding. When the <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> clear, the people of Strathcona feted Rutherford with a torchlight procession and bonfire.|$|E
5|$|Games between FBS and FCS teams {{typically}} {{result in}} lopsided victories for the FBS team, and the Appalachian State–Michigan game {{was not expected}} to be an exception. The predicted <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> a lopsided victory for Michigan. Las Vegas sportsbooks did not give a betting line. The game was also the first to be broadcast on the then-new Big Ten Network. It began with a strong first half for Appalachian State, who held a 28–17 lead {{at the end of the}} half. Michigan regained the lead at 32–31 in the fourth quarter, but Appalachian State took the lead for a second time on a short field goal with 26seconds left. The Mountaineers blocked a game-winning field goal attempt from Michigan at the end of regulation to secure a 34–32 win.|$|E

5000|$|Strict {{stationary}} equilibria: A Nash equilibrium {{is called}} strict if each player strictly prefers the infinite sequence of outcomes attained in equilibrium, over any othe sequence he can deviate to.

5|$|In August 1915, Spinks {{was tapped}} {{to join a}} consultative panel of notable players and major billiard hall proprietors to help develop a new handicapping system for balkline billiards, {{organized}} by the Brunswick-Balke-Collender Company, {{at that time the}} organizers of the World Championships. The inspiration for the new system was simply making it possible for the newly ascendant Willie Hoppe to be meaningfully challenged – his near-unassailability was hurting billiard tournament revenues, because the <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> considered foreordained by many potential ticket-buyers. The system was expected {{to level the playing field}} in other ways, especially making it easier for skilled amateurs to enter the professional ranks.|$|E
5|$|In {{individual}} Olympic competition, Heath won {{a silver}} medal in the 200-meter freestyle (1:49.10) behind Gross's world record-setting performance (1:47.44). He also placed fourth in the 100-meter freestyle event final (50.41); the <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> controversial, however, because of a premature starter gun and a quick start by Gaines, the winner. Gaines' coach, Richard Quick, knew of starter Frank Silvestri's propensity to fire the starter gun almost immediately when the swimmers mounted the blocks. Gaines gained about a meter's head start on the competition; video of the event later confirmed that {{one or more of}} the swimmers had not been set when the starter gun fired.|$|E
5|$|In the end, Emir Habibullah {{returned}} to his vacillating inactivity. He was aware the mission had found support within his council and had excited his volatile subjects. Four days after the draft treaty was signed, Habibullah called for a durbar, a grand meeting where a jihad {{was expected to be}} called. Instead, Habibullah reaffirmed his neutrality, explaining that the war's <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> still unpredictable and that he stood for national unity. Throughout the spring of 1916, he continuously deflected the mission's overtures and gradually increased the stakes, demanding that India rise in revolution before he began his campaign. It was clear to Habibullah that for the treaty to hold any value, it required the Kaiser's signature, and that for Germany to even attempt to honour the treaty, she would have to be in a strong position in the war. It was a good insurance policy for Habibullah.|$|E
50|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish a self-defeating prophecy from a self-fulfilling prophecy that predicts a negative outcome. If a prophecy of a negative <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> made, and that negative <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> achieved {{as a result of}} positive feedback, then it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, if a group of people decide {{they will not be able}} to achieve a goal and stop working towards the goal as a result, their prophecy was self-fulfilling. Likewise, if a prediction of a negative <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> made, but the <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> positive because of negative feedback resulting from the rebellion, then that is a self-defeating prophecy.|$|R

5|$|The American Chess Congress' final {{proposal}} {{was that the}} winner of a tournament {{to be held in}} New York in 1889 should be regarded as world champion for the time being, but must be prepared to face a challenge from the second or third placed competitor within a month. Steinitz wrote that he would not play in the tournament and would not challenge the winner unless the second and third placed competitors failed to do so. The tournament was duly played, but the <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> not quite as planned: Mikhail Chigorin and Max Weiss tied for first place; their play-off resulted in four draws, and Weiss then wanted to get back to his work for the Rothschild Bank, conceding the title to Chigorin.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Besançon (21 June 1575) was a sectarian {{conflict}} between the Protestants and Catholics in the French city of Besançon {{in the region of}} Franche-Comté. Prior to the battle, the Huguenots, accused of heresy, had been expelled from the city and fled to the County of Montbéliard and Switzerland; the outcasts formed an army and planned an attempt to retake Besançon and turn the city into a stronghold of the Protestant Reformation. By the time the armed Protestants had reached the city of Besançon however, their army had dwindled because of several mishaps. Nonetheless, the battle began and raged for several hours; the <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> an overwhelming Catholic victory. The majority of the Protestant army managed to escape, but those who were captured were hanged as traitors. For over two centuries after the battle, Protestantism in Besançon was repressed.|$|E
5|$|The CIA put {{the plan}} into motion in late 1952. A {{freighter}} {{that had been}} borrowed from the UFC was specially refitted in New Orleans and loaded with weapons {{under the guise of}} agricultural machinery, and set sail for Nicaragua. However, the plan was terminated soon after: accounts of its termination vary. Some sources state that the State Department discovered the plan when a senior official was asked to sign a certain document, while others suggest that Somoza was indiscreet. The eventual <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> that Secretary of State Dean Acheson called off the operation. The CIA continued to support Castillo Armas; it paid him a monthly retainer of 3000 U.S. dollars, and gave him the resources to maintain his rebel force.|$|E

The lowest support for EU accession was recorded in Dubrovnik-Neretva County, where 42.22% of votes were cast against the proposal. The average official turnout for the referendum was 43.51%; the highest official turnouts were recorded {{in the city of}} Zagreb and in Varaždin County at 55.13% and 53.66% respectively. The result was binding on the Croatian Parliament; as a consequence, it ratified the accession treaty on 9 March 2012.

5|$|The Ninth Five-Year Plan {{delivered}} a change: {{for the first}} time industrial consumer products out-produced industrial capital goods. Consumer goods such as watches, furniture and radios were produced in abundance. The plan still left the bulk of the state's investment in industrial capital-goods production. This <b>outcome</b> <b>was</b> not seen as a positive sign {{for the future of the}} Soviet state by the majority of top party functionaries within the government; by 1975 consumer goods were expanding 9% slower than industrial capital-goods. The policy continued despite Brezhnev's commitment to make a rapid shift of investment to satisfy Soviet consumers and lead to an even higher standard of living. This did not happen.|$|E

Henry's oldest son Edward – the later King Edward Istarted a military campaign that ended in the Battle of Evesham in August 1265, where Montfort was defeated and killed. Parts of the baronial resistance still held out, {{but by the end of}} 1266 the final garrison at Kenilworth Castle surrendered.
