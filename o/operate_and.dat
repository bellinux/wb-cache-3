5|$|The 1930s {{improvements}} {{included the}} construction of the Prescott Channel, designed to allow flood water to bypass the Three Mills tide mills.

5|$|Electromagnetic isotope {{separation}} {{was developed by}} Lawrence at the University of California Radiation Laboratory. This method employed devices known as calutrons, a hybrid of the standard laboratory mass spectrometer and cyclotron. The name {{was derived from the}} words California, university and cyclotron. In the electromagnetic process, a magnetic field deflected charged particles according to mass. The process was neither scientifically elegant nor industrially efficient. Compared with a gaseous diffusion plant or a nuclear reactor, an electromagnetic separation plant would consume more scarce materials, require more manpower to <b>operate,</b> <b>and</b> cost more to build. Nonetheless, the process was approved because it was based on proven technology and therefore represented less risk. Moreover, it could be built in stages, and rapidly reach industrial capacity.|$|E
5|$|Following Farsari's {{departure}} from Japan in 1890, his studio continued to <b>operate</b> <b>and</b> even listed him as proprietor until 1901, when Tonokura Tsunetarō became the owner. Tonokura, whom Farsari had known since the mid-1870s, had long managed {{the day-to-day operations}} of the studio. In 1904 Tonokura left the business {{to start his own}} studio and another of Farsari's former employees, Watanabe Tokutarō, became the new owner, only to be succeeded by the former secretary, Fukagawa Itomaro. The business was finally registered as a Japanese company in 1906 and it continued to operate until at least 1917 and possibly as late as 1923, the year in which Yokohama was largely destroyed by the Great Kantō earthquake. A. Farsari & Co. was the last notable foreign-owned photographic studio to operate in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Hundreds of {{television}} channels, thousands {{of local and}} national radio stations, several dozen newspapers, a productive and profitable national cinema and a rapid growth of broadband Internet use all make up a very vibrant media industry in Turkey. In 2003 a total of 257 television stations and 1,100 radio stations were licensed to <b>operate,</b> <b>and</b> others operated without licenses. Of those licensed, 16 television and 36 radio stations reached national audiences. The majority of the audiences are shared among public broadcaster TRT and the network-style channels such as Kanal D, Show TV, ATV and Star TV. The broadcast media {{have a very high}} penetration as satellite dishes and cable systems are widely available. The Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK) is the government body overseeing the broadcast media. By circulation, the most popular newspapers are Posta, Hürriyet, Sözcü, Sabah and Habertürk.|$|E

5|$|In 1979, two Michigan businessmen, John Rudzewicz and Brian MacShara, {{entered into}} a {{franchise}} agreement with Burger King to run a restaurant in Detroit, Michigan.

However, during this time disagreements arose between the partners and Burger King over issues of rent, construction fees, building designs and the assignment of legal liabilities. MacShara and Ruzewicz finally signed their franchise agreement after gaining limited concessions over the issues, with Rudzewicz assuming a 20-year, $1,000,000 financial obligation {{over the life of the}} contract.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 2008, {{the project}} had been {{estimated}} {{at a total}} cost of $3.1 billion USD, however the revised project has an estimated cost of $1 billion USD (The difference in estimates partially {{due to differences in}} previous tunnel designs).

Miami-Dade County allegedly contributed $402 million, the city of Miami $50 million, and the state $650 million to build, <b>operate</b> <b>and</b> maintain it. Those contributions are spread during construction and operation of the tunnel project. During construction, 90% of the funds are provided by the private sector. Of the estimated one billion dollar total project cost, 607 million it said to go to design and construction, 195.1 million to financing, 59.6 million to insurance and maintenance during construction, 41.2 million to reserves, and 209.8 million for state development cost.|$|E

Under current Australian Government planning they will be replaced by 72 Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II fighters.|$|E
