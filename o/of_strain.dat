5|$|Born in Ramelton, Ireland, Gallaher {{migrated}} to New Zealand {{with his family}} as a small child. After moving to Auckland, in 1895 he joined Ponsonby RFC and was selected for his province in 1896. In 1901–02 he served with the New Zealand Contingent in the Anglo-Boer War. He first appeared on the New Zealand national team for their unbeaten tour of Australia in 1903, and played in New Zealand's first ever test match, against Australia in Sydney. The Originals Gallaher captained during 1905–06 helped to cement rugby as New Zealand's national sport, but he was relentlessly pilloried by the British press {{for his role as}} wing-forward. The use of a wing-forward, which critics felt was a tactic to deliberately obstruct opponents, contributed to decades <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> between the rugby authorities of New Zealand and the Home Nations; the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) effectively outlawed the position in 1931.|$|E

5|$|Recent Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) {{regulations}} have {{given rise to}} a new variety of steel known as Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS). This material is both strong and ductile so that vehicle structures can maintain their current safety levels while using less material. There are several commercially available grades of AHSS, such as dual-phase steel, which is heat treated to contain both a ferritic and martensitic microstructure to produce a formable, high strength steel. Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steel involves special alloying and heat treatments to stabilize amounts of austenite at room temperature in normally austenite-free low-alloy ferritic steels. By applying strain, the austenite undergoes a phase transition to martensite without the addition of heat. Twinning Induced Plasticity (TWIP) steel uses a specific type <b>of</b> <b>strain</b> to increase the effectiveness of work hardening on the alloy.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{existence}} of possible cross-protection between Trypanosoma congolense <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> low and extreme virulence circulating in the same trypanosomiasis focus. Groups of six mice were infected using one <b>of</b> three <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> low virulence and challenged with one <b>of</b> three <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> extreme virulence. A group of six mice was used as control for each <b>strain</b> <b>of</b> low and extreme virulence.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the activities of trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin, alone and in combination with cefoperazone, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, against 100 <b>strains</b> <b>of</b> Stenotrophomonas maltophilia by the MIC determination method and by synergy testing of the combinations by the time-kill and checkerboard titration methods for 20 strains. The respective MICs at which 50 % and 90 % of isolates were inhibited for the drugs used alone were as follows: trovafloxacin, 0. 5 and 2. 0 μg/ml; levofloxacin, 2. 0 and 4. 0 μg/ml; ciprofloxacin, 4. 0 and 16. 0 μg/ml; cefoperazone, > 128. 0 and > 128. 0 μg/ml; ceftazidime, 32. 0 and > 128. 0 μg/ml; cefpirome, > 128. 0 and > 128. 0 μg/ml; and gentamicin, 128. 0 and > 128. 0 μg/ml. Synergistic fractional inhibitory concentration indices (≤ 0. 5) were found for ≥ 50 % <b>of</b> <b>strains</b> for trovafloxacin-cefoperazone, trovafloxacin-ceftazidime, levofloxacin-cefoperazone, levofloxacin-ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin-cefoperazone, and ciprofloxacin-ceftazidime, with other combinations affecting fewer strains. For 20 strains tested by the checkerboard titration and time-kill methods, synergy (≥ 100 -fold drop in count compared to the count achieved with the more active compound) was more pronounced after 12 h due to regrowth after 24 h. At 12 h, trovafloxacin at 0. 004 to 0. 5 μg/ml showed synergy with cefoperazone for 90 % <b>of</b> <b>strains,</b> with ceftazidime for 95 % <b>of</b> <b>strains</b> with cefpirome for 95 % <b>of</b> <b>strains,</b> and with gentamicin for 65 % <b>of</b> <b>strains.</b> Levofloxacin at 0. 03 to 0. 5 μg/ml and ciprofloxacin at 0. 5 to 2. 0 μg/ml showed synergy with cefoperazone for 80 % <b>of</b> <b>strains,</b> with ceftazidime for 90 and 85 % <b>of</b> <b>strains,</b> respectively, with cefpirome for 85 and 75 % <b>of</b> <b>strains,</b> respectively, and with gentamicin for 65 and 75 % <b>of</b> <b>strains,</b> respectively.
