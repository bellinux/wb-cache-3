40|$|Four {{experiments}} {{examined the}} free-operant <b>observing</b> behavior of rats. In Experiment 1, <b>observing</b> was a bitonic function of random-ratio schedule {{requirements for the}} primary reinforcer. In Experiment 2, decreases in {{the magnitude of the}} primary reinforcer decreased <b>observing.</b> Experiment 3 examined <b>observing</b> when a random-ratio schedule or a yoked random-time schedule of primary reinforcement was in effect across conditions. Removing the response requirement for the primary reinforcer increased <b>observing,</b> suggesting that the effects of the random-ratio schedule in Experiment 1 likely were due to an interaction between <b>observing</b> and responding for the primary reinforcer. In Experiment 4, decreasing the rate of primary reinforcement by increasing the duration of a random-time schedule decreased <b>observing</b> monotonically. Overall, these results suggest that <b>observing</b> decreases with decreases in the rate or magnitude of the primary reinforcer, but that behavior related to the primary reinforcer can affect <b>observing</b> and potentially affect measurement of conditioned reinforcing value...|$|R

5|$|During one {{period of}} {{rotation}} for PSR B1937+21, there are two peaks <b>observed,</b> known as the pulse and interpulse. PSR B1937+21 is unusual among pulsars in that it occasionally produces pulses far brighter than an average pulse. Until 1995, the sole other pulsar known to produce giant pulses was the Crab pulsar, and by 2006, there were 11 pulsars that had been <b>observed</b> to produce giant pulses {{out of more than}} 1500 known pulsars. The giant pulses of PSR B1937+21 were first <b>observed</b> in 1984, shortly after its discovery, but difficulty in observing single pulses of PSR B1937+21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first <b>observed.</b> In more recent follow up observations, more giant pulses have been found. These giant pulses have been <b>observed</b> to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse. The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of the pulsar, lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds. The flux density of <b>observed</b> pulses is somewhat variable, but has been <b>observed</b> to be as high as 6.5 Wm−2Hz−1 (6.5 janskys). The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high flux density and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the pulses of PSR B1937+21 the brightest radio emission ever <b>observed.</b> PSR B1937+21 is intrinsically the most luminous millisecond pulsar. In addition to the radio pulses <b>observed,</b> pulses have been detected at x-ray wavelengths, which show the same pulse and interpulse pattern.|$|E
40|$|An <b>observing</b> {{procedure}} {{was used to}} investigate the effects of alterations in response–conditioned-reinforcer relations on <b>observing.</b> Pigeons responded to produce schedule-correlated stimuli paired with the availability of food or extinction. The contingency between <b>observing</b> responses and conditioned reinforcement was altered in three experiments. In Experiment 1, after a contingency was established in baseline between the <b>observing</b> response and conditioned reinforcement, it was removed and the schedule-correlated stimuli were presented independently of responding according to a variable-time schedule. The variable-time schedule was constructed such {{that the rate of}} stimulus presentations was yoked from baseline. The removal of the <b>observing</b> contingency reliably reduced rates of <b>observing.</b> In Experiment 2, resetting delays to conditioned reinforcement were imposed between <b>observing</b> responses and the schedule-correlated stimuli they produced. Delay values of 0, 0. 5, 1, 5, and 10  s were examined. Rates of <b>observing</b> varied inversely as a function of delay value. In Experiment 3, signaled and unsignaled resetting delays between <b>observing</b> responses and schedule-correlated stimuli were compared. Baseline rates of <b>observing</b> were decreased less by signaled delays than by unsignaled delays. Disruptions in response–conditioned-reinforcer relations produce similar behavioral effects to those found with primary reinforcement...|$|R
