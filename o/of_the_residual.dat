25|$|To achieve andesitic {{composition}} via fractional crystallization, a basaltic magma must crystallize specific minerals {{that are}} then {{removed from the}} melt. This removal can {{take place in a}} variety of ways, but most commonly this occurs by crystal settling. The first minerals to crystallize and be removed from a basaltic parent are olivines and amphiboles. These mafic minerals settle out of the magma, forming mafic cumulates. There is geophysical evidence from several arcs that large layers of mafic cumulates lie {{at the base of the}} crust. Once these mafic minerals have been removed, the melt no longer has a basaltic composition. The silica content <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> melt is enriched relative to the starting composition. The iron and magnesium contents are depleted. As this process continues, the melt becomes more and more evolved eventually becoming andesitic. Without continued addition of mafic material, however, the melt will eventually reach a rhyolitic composition.|$|E

25|$|As magma cools, {{minerals}} typically crystallize {{from the}} melt at different temperatures (fractional crystallization). As minerals crystallize, the composition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> melt typically changes. If crystals {{separate from the}} melt, then the residual melt will differ in composition from the parent magma. For instance, a magma of gabbroic composition can produce a residual melt of granitic composition if early formed crystals are separated from the magma. Gabbro may have a liquidus temperature near 1,200°C, and the derivative granite-composition melt may have a liquidus temperature as low as about 700°C. Incompatible elements are concentrated in the last residues of magma during fractional crystallization {{and in the first}} melts produced during partial melting: either process can form the magma that crystallizes to pegmatite, a rock type commonly enriched in incompatible elements. Bowen's reaction series is important for understanding the idealised sequence of fractional crystallisation of a magma.|$|E
25|$|Part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> {{legitimacy}} of the Vichy regime resulted from the continued ambivalence of U.S. and other leaders. President Roosevelt continued to cultivate Vichy, and promoted General Henri Giraud as a preferable alternative to de Gaulle, despite the poor performance of Vichy forces in North Africa—Admiral François Darlan had landed in Algiers the day before Operation Torch. Algiers was headquarters of the Vichy French XIX Army Corps, which controlled Vichy military units in North Africa. Darlan was neutralized within 15 hours by a 400-strong French resistance force. Roosevelt and Churchill accepted Darlan, rather than de Gaulle, as the French leader in North Africa. De Gaulle had not even been informed of the landing in North Africa. The United States also resented the Free French taking control of St Pierre and Miquelon on 24 December 1941, because, Secretary of State Hull believed, it interfered with a U.S.-Vichy agreement {{to maintain the status}} quo with respect to French territorial possessions in the western hemisphere.|$|E
25|$|Information {{provided}} to the IAEA indicated that storage pool temperatures at both Units 5 and 6 remained steady around 60–68°C between 19:00 JST 14 March and 21:00 JST 18 March, though rising slowly.

Later in the day, Pump B in Unit 6 was also restarted to allow cooling of the spent fuel pool and reactor core there. Crews had installed temporary submersible seawater pumps and hoses to supply cooling water to the residual heat removal system heat exchangers as the main seawater pumps were heavily damaged by the tsunami. Additionally, as there was heavy damage to electrical equipment in the basements from flooding, temporary power connections had to be made to the residual heat removal system main loop pumps. Temperature at Unit 5 pool decreased to 48°C on 19 March 18:00 JST, and 37°C on 20 March when Unit 6 pool temperature had fallen to 41°C.
