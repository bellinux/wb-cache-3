50|$|In the {{beginning}} Taipoxin {{was thought to}} be only neurotoxic. Studies showed an increase in acetylcholine release, indicating a presynaptic activity. Further experiments showed that Taipoxin inhibited the responses to electrical stimuli greater than the reaction to additionally administered acetylcholine. This led to the conclusion that Taipoxin has pre- and postsynaptic effects. Additional to the increased acetylcholine release it inhibits the vesicular recycling. More recent studies showed that the toxin has a myotoxic effect as well. The injection of Taipoxin into the hind limbs of rats leads to <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> and muscle degeneration. The study also supports the findings by Fohlman, that the α subunit yields the PLA2 potency, which is similar to the potency of notexin. Even so, the full potential of the raw toxin is only reached by the combination of the α and γ subunits.|$|E

This study was designed to evaluate the influence of early reperfusion and choice of rat strains on infarct volume and <b>oedema</b> <b>formation.</b> Thirty-six Wistar and Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 90 min (groups I and II) or to permanent MCAO (groups III and IV) using the suture technique. Ischaemic lesion volume and <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> were quantified 24 h after MCAO using 7 T-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Impact of rat strains: Reperfusion led to significant larger ischaemic lesion volumes in Wistar rats as compared to Sprague-Dawley rats (P 3 ̆c 0. 0005). <b>Oedema</b> <b>formation</b> was similar in both rat strains. Permanent MCAO led to significantly larger ischaemic lesion volumes in Sprague-Dawley rats (P 3 ̆c 0. 05). <b>Oedema</b> <b>formation,</b> however, was significantly more accentuated in Wistar rats (P 3 ̆c 0. 005). Impact of reperfusion: Reperfusion did not cause any changes in ischaemic lesion volume in Wistar rats. <b>Oedema</b> <b>formation,</b> however, was significantly reduced (P 3 ̆c 0. 0005). In Sprague-Dawley rats, reperfusion caused a significant reduction of ischaemic lesion volume (P 3 ̆c 0. 00005), but did not modify <b>oedema</b> <b>formation.</b> These findings emphasize the critical importance of rat strain differences in experimental stroke research...|$|E
40|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) is an autoimmune disorder {{characterized by}} synovial proliferation (synovitis), articular cartilage and subchondral bone degradation and synovial inflammation. Joint swelling and oedema often accompany pannus formation and joint chronic inflammation in RA. Clinical {{evidence suggests that}} joint swelling and oedema frequently accompany the chronic inflammation observed in synovial joints of RA patients. Although joint swelling is understood {{to be a major}} problem in synovitis, very {{little is known about the}} molecular mechanisms responsible for the <b>oedema</b> fluid <b>formation</b> that is associated with joint inflammation. Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that articular chondrocytes and synoviocytes express aquaporin 1 (AQP 1) water channels. Aquaporins are a family of small integral membrane proteins related to the major intrinsic protein (MIP or AQP 0). In recent studies we have used immunohistochemistry to investigate whether the expression of the AQP 1 water channel is altered in synovitis. Our data suggests that this membrane protein is upregulated in the synovium derived from RA and psoriatic arthritis patients. In this chapter these observations are discussed in the context of RA and psoriatic arthritis. AQP 1 and other aquaporins may play an important role in joint swelling and the vasogenic <b>oedema</b> fluid <b>formation</b> and hydrarthrosis associated with synovial inflammation. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

40|$|Chemical {{analysis}} of brain tumour cyst contents has invalidated {{the concept of}} cyst formation being the result of tumour necrosis, and a common mechanism of vasogenic brain <b>oedema</b> and cyst <b>formation,</b> namely blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, has been suggested. To analyse a possible relationship between the occurrence of vasogenic oedema and the presence, of cysts, we performed a volumetric analysis on the MRI and CT studies of 60 patients with primary or metastatic brain tumours. We compared four groups of tumours: 30 gliomas, of which 15 were cystic and 15 not and 30 metastatic brain tumours of which 15 were cystic and 15 not. Although the mean volume of oedema was similar for cystic and noncystic tumours, the ratio of oedema to tumour volume was approximately four times as high in cystic supratentorial tumours. This would {{support the view that}} cyst formation may be related to relatively greater production of oedema, possibly due to fusion of microcysts containing oedema fluid. The ratio of oedema to tumour volume is not greater in cystic cerebellar and intraventricular tumours. This {{may be due to the}} different anatomical organization of the cerebellar white matter, and the fact that the intraventricular tumours are bordered by subcortical grey matter. In these cases, spread of <b>oedema</b> is impeded. <b>Formation</b> of a large amount of brain oedema is therefore not an essential prerequisite for cyst formation...|$|R

40|$|The {{contribution}} of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) to bilateral <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> in the rat hindpaw following an unilateral challenge with CGRP was investigated. Rats were {{injected into the}} left hindpaw with either saline, CGRP or a CGRP antagonist (CGRP 8 – 37). All injections were given in a double blind fashion and in a volume of 100 [*]μl. CGRP and CGRP 8 – 37 were administered in concentrations of 75, 150 or 300 [*]pmol. Volumes of {{the right and left}} hindpaw were measured every hour for 5 [*]h by plethysmometry. Injection of CGRP 300 [*]pmol into the left hindpaw resulted in a bilaterally increased hindpaw volume after 5 [*]h as compared with the groups given saline. No changes were found in hindpaw volumes following the injection of either 75 or 150 [*]pmol of CGRP or 75, 150 or 300 [*]pmol of CGRP 8 – 37 as compared with saline injection. To elucidate whether or not the bilateral <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> was related to a release of endogenous CGRP, microdialysis of the contralateral hindpaw was carried out, and concentrations of CGRP-like immunoreactivity (-LI) were determined by radioimmunoassay and high performance liquid chromatography. Injection of CGRP 300 [*]pmol into the left hindpaw increased the release of CGRP-LI into the right hindpaw perfusate after 4 and 5 [*]h. No changes in CGRP-LI were detected in the right hindpaw perfusate following challenge with saline or CGRP 8 – 37. To study the {{contribution of}} the nervous system to the contralateral release of CGRP-LI, sciatic nerve ligated and intact sham-operated rats were used. Sciatic nerve ligation but not sham-operation on the non-injected side abolished the increased release of CGRP-LI following contralateral administration of CGRP 300 [*]pmol. To study the spinal cord mechanisms resulting in the bilateral <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> following unilateral challenge with 300 [*]pmol of CGRP, intrathecal pretreatment with either 10 [*]nmol bicuculline (GABAA receptor antagonist) or 10 [*]nmol CGRP 8 – 37 was carried out. Bicuculline but not CGRP 8 – 37 abolished the bilateral <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> induced by CGRP 300 [*]pmol. In order to study the mechanisms by which administration of CGRP 300 [*]pmol induces oedema, CGRP 300 [*]pmol was administered concomitantly with either 300 [*]pmol of CGRP 8 – 37 (CGRP receptor antagonist), or 3 [*]nmol of promethazine (H 1 receptor antagonist), or 3 [*]nmol of s(−) -propranolol (5 -HT 1 receptor antagonist), or 3 [*]nmol of cyproheptadine (5 -HT 2 receptor antagonist) or 3 [*]nmol of ICS 205 – 930 (5 -HT 3 receptor antagonist). <b>Oedema</b> <b>formation</b> was measured at 1, 5, 7 and 24 [*]h. Injection of CGRP 300 [*]pmol into the left hindpaw induced a bilateral <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> which was still significant at 24 [*]h. Concomitant administration of either CGRP 8 – 37, ICS 205 – 920 or cyproheptadine blocked the <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> at 24 [*]h. No effect on <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> was found when CGRP 300 [*]pmol was co-administered with either promethazine or s(−) -propranolol (H 1 and 5 -HT 1 receptor antagonists, respectively). The {{results of the present study}} show that both the nervous system and local inflammatory processes contribute to bilateral hindpaw <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> following unilateral challenge with CGRP 300 [*]pmol. Our results indicate that endogenous release of CGRP following inflammatory response may play an important role in inducing <b>oedema</b> <b>formation...</b>|$|E

40|$|Low {{molecular}} weight heparin (LMWH) {{appears to be}} a promising solution for reducing inflammatory post-burn episodes and results in improved healing. The clinical examination presented here includes patients with burn wounds ranging from 20 to 35 % total body surface area (TBSA) who were categorized into two groups, of which one received subcutaneous LMWH treatment (10, 000 units/day) and the other acted as control. The process of healing was assessed through regular examination of clinical features such as regression of erythema and <b>oedema,</b> eschar <b>formation,</b> and rate of re-epithelialization. Various studies have demonstrated an increase in levels of serum IL- 6 indicating the severity of the morbid condition. In the present investigation, LMWH-treated patients exhibited a faster decline in levels of serum IL- 6 (within 12 days) than control. Infiltration of inflammatory cells at the local wound site was assessed through a histological analysis of tissue samples taken on various days during the healing process. The LMWH-treated groups exhibited an organized healing pattern with better remodelling in a shorter duration (28 days), while control patients took more than 28 days for complete healing. A slight correlation was observed with TBSA to the inflammatory process, which subsided in patients treated with LMWH, favourably modulating the events involved in the inflammatory process of burn wound healing...|$|R
40|$|Pulmonary injury from smoke {{inhalation}} {{is common}} in burn victims, significantly contributing to the morbidity and mortality of fire-related injuries. The impacts of improvement in other aspects of burn care have not been mirrored in treatment of smoke inhalation. Smoke is heterogeneous and unique to each fire; it comprises particulates, respiratory irritants and systemic toxins as well as heat, all contributing to the pathological insult. Thermal injury below the vocal cords is rare because of effective heat dissipation in the upper airway. Particulate matter is the chief contributor to the pathophysiology of smoke inhalation injury, which has been extensively described. Of paramount importance is the cascade of inflammatory mediators following interaction of irritant substances with lung parenchyma, leading to pulmonary <b>oedema,</b> cast <b>formation,</b> airway obstruction, loss of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Current treatment is based on supportive care, with airway management, mechanical ventilation, humidification and aggressive airway toilet the mainstays. Nebulisation of n 2 -agonists, heparin and N-acetylcysteine {{have a role in}} management, as does more specific treatment of carbon monoxide or cyanide intoxication. Many promising treatments are currently under investigation. The therapeutic strategy of decontaminating the lungs early after smoke exposure to prevent inhalation injury has received little attention and may be of significant value.

30|$|Acute retinal {{necrosis}} (ARN) is an uncommon, devastating, {{and potentially}} blinding necrotizing retinitis. It is most commonly seen in healthy young individuals, {{but can be}} seen in immunocompromised patients also [1]. ARN is a clinical diagnosis, and polymerase chain reaction of the vitreous or aqueous aspirate can be used to identify the viral DNA responsible for the disease [1]. The major causes of poor visual outcome in a case of ARN are retinal detachment, optic nerve, or macular involvement by ischemic vasculopathy [2]. Involvement of the posterior pole is relatively uncommon, except for inflammatory macular <b>oedema,</b> epimacular membrane <b>formation,</b> or retinitis in untreated or late stages of the disease. Cystoid macular oedema in these patients tends to be recurrent and resistant to treatment, threatening central vision even after resolution of ocular inflammation and requires additional treatment [3].|$|R
40|$|By {{using the}} selective, potent and long acting platelet-activating factor (PAF) antagonist, UK- 74, 505, we {{investigated}} {{the role of}} PAF in a local Shwartzman reaction (LSR) and a reversed passive Arthus (RPA) reaction in rabbit skin. For comparison, we also studied {{the effect of the}} PAF antagonist on neutrophil aggregation in vitro and on acute inflammatory responses induced by intradermally (i. d.) injected lipopolysaccharide (LPS), PAF, bradykinin and zymosan-activated plasma. Neutrophil aggregation was assessed photometrically. Haemorrhage, <b>oedema</b> <b>formation,</b> platelet deposition and neutrophil accumulation were quantified in rabbit skin by measuring the accumulation of i. v. injected 51 Cr-labelled red blood cells (RBC), 125 I-labelled human serum albumin, 111 In-labelled platelets and 111 In-labelled neutrophils respectively. UK- 74, 505 inhibited in vitro neutrophil aggregation induced by PAF but not by leukotriene B 4. When injected i. v. into rabbits UK- 74, 505 suppressed <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> in response to i. d. PAF for up to 4 [*]h but had no effect on oedema induced by bradykinin or zymosan-activated plasma. <b>Oedema</b> <b>formation,</b> but not neutrophil accumulation, produced during the RPA reaction was significantly inhibited by i. v.

UK- 74, 505 did not affect haemorrhage or <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> produced during the LPS-mediated LSR. The results demonstrate that PAF is an important mediator of <b>oedema</b> <b>formation,</b> but not neutrophil accumulation, in the immune-complex mediated RPA reaction in rabbit skin. PAF also appears to be required for platelet, but not neutrophil, accumulation in response to locally injected LPS. Our studies do not suggest a role for PAF in the LPS-mediated LSR...|$|E

We emphasise that the movement of fl uids is largely driven without new expenditure of energy by the ischaemic brain. We organise the progressive changes in osmotic and hydrostatic conductivity of abnormal capillaries into three phases: formation of ionic <b>oedema,</b> <b>formation</b> of vasogenic oedema, and catastrophic failure with haemorrhagic conversion. We suggest a new theory suggesting that ischaemia-induced capillary dysfunction can be attributed to de novo synthesis of a specifi c ensemble of proteins that determine osmotic and hydraulic conductivity in Starling’s equation, and whose expression is driven by a distinct transcriptional program...|$|E
40|$|The non-peptide ET-receptor {{antagonist}} Bosentan {{was used}} to investigate the role of endogenous endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) {{in the development of}} the Sephadex-induced lung inflammation in the rat. Intratracheal instillation of Sephadex caused a 60 -fold rise in endothelin- 1 -like-immunoreactivity (ET- 1 -LI) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) concomitant with development of lung oedema, an influx of inflammatory cells into the airways and a rise in the protein content in BALF. The ET- 1 -LI level in lung homogenate was not significantly affected. Pre-treatment with Bosentan reduced ET- 1 -LI content in the lung parenchyma but increased ET- 1 -LI levels in BALF, possibly indicating an effective displacement of ET- 1 from its receptors. In Bosentan-treated animals there was an enhancement of the lung <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> following Sephadex instillation, but no significant change in the number of leucocytes or protein concentration in BALF. The present data thus do not support the hypothesis that endogenous ET- 1 mediates <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> or leucocyte influx in this model.

40|$|Extensive {{myocardial}} bridging in {{the left}} anterior descending coronary artery {{was found in a}} 46 year old survivor of sudden cardiac near-death. Positron emission tomography and dobutamine stress echocardiography revealed ischaemia in the myocardium distal to the bridging. Spasm was excluded as cause of the ischaemia by intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine. Further evaluation of the haemodynamic importance of the bridging using intracoronary Doppler flow velocity measurements revealed an abnormal flow reserve. Dobutamine stress during coronary angiography caused increased mechanical compression during diastole. This was accompanied by multiple premature ventricular contractions. After a debridging operation the flow velocity reserve was normal. The abnormalities found during dobutamine stress had disappeared. Unexpectedly, a spasm was inducible. This may have been due to local <b>oedema</b> or scar <b>formation</b> after the operation. For the evaluation of the haemodynamic importance of myocardial bridging, intracoronary Doppler flow velocity measurements and angiography during dobutamine stress may be helpful in clinical decision making...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} MRI findings in patients successfully operated upon for lumbar disc herniation. We investigated 20 patients with a successful outcome after L 4 - 5 or L 5 -S 1 disc operations clinically and with MRI preoperatively, and at 5 days, 6 weeks, and 4 months after surgery. Postoperatively, T 1 - and T 2 -weighted images were obtained. At 4 months gadolinium-enhanced images were added. Pronounced intraspinal MRI changes were seen during follow-up. Deformation of the dural sac was seen in 13 patients preoperatively, in 19 at 5 days after operation, in 15 at 6 weeks, and in 12 at 4 months. Nerve root involvement was seen in all cases both preoperatively and at 5 days after operation, in 17 at 6 weeks, and in 15 at 4 months. No correlation between symptoms or the straight leg raising test and the size or nature of the abnormal tissue in the spinal canal postoperatively could be demonstrated.

40|$|Kinin B 2 {{receptor}} antagonists or tissue kallikrein (t-KK) inhibitors prevent <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> {{and associated}} sequelae in caerulein-induced pancreatitis in the rat. We have now further investigated {{the mechanism of}} kinin generation in the pancreas. Kinins were elevated in the pancreatic tissue already before <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> became manifest. Peak values (421 ± 59 pmol g− 1 dry wt) were reached at 45 min and remained elevated for at least 2 h; a second increase was observed at 24 h. Pretreatment with the B 2 receptor antagonist icatibant abolished kinin formation, while post-treatment was ineffective. Total kininogen levels were very low in the pancreas of controls, but increased 75 -fold during acute pancreatitis. This increase was absent in rats that were pretreated with icatibant. During pancreatitis, t-KK-like and plasma kallikrein (p-KK) -like activity in the pancreas, as well as trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) increased significantly. Icatibant pretreatment further augmented t-KK about 100 -fold, while p-KK was significantly attenuated; TAP levels remained unaffected. Endogenous protease inhibitors (α 1 -antitrypsin, α 2 -macroglobulin) were low in normal tissues, but increased 45 - and four-fold, respectively, during pancreatitis. This increase was abolished when <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> was prevented by icatibant. In summary, <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> is initiated by t-KK; the ensuing plasma protein extravasation supplies further kininogen and active p-KK to the tissue. Concomitantly, endogenous protease inhibitors in the oedema fluid inhibit up to 99 % of active t-KK. Our data thus suggest a complex interaction between kinin action and kinin generation involving positive and negative feedback actions of the inflammatory oedema...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: Hydrogen {{sulphide}} (H 2 S), {{considered as}} a novel gas transmitter, is produced endogenously in mammalian tissue from L-cysteine by two enzymes cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) and cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE). Recently, {{it has been reported}} that H 2 S contributes to the local and systemic inflammation in several experimental animal models. We conducted this study to investigate on the signaling involved in H 2 S induced inflammation. Experimental approach: L-cysteine or sodium hydrogen sulphide (NaHS) were injected in the mouse hind paw and <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> was evaluated for 60 min. In order to investigate on the H 2 S–induced <b>oedema</b> <b>formation,</b> we used different pharmacological tools: serotonin and histamine receptor antagonists, KATP channels or arachidonic acid cascade inhibitors. Prostaglandin levels were determined in hind paw exudates by radioimmunoassay. Finally, the histological analysis was performed on L-cisteine injected hind paw. Key results: Both NaHS and L-cysteine caused <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> characterized by a fast onset which peaked at 30 minutes. This oedematogenic action was not associated with histamine, serotonin release or KATP channel activation. Conversely, the <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> was significantly inhibited by ciclooxygenase and phospholipase A 2 selective inhibitors. Moreover, the prostaglandin levels were significantly increased in exudates of hind paw injected with NaHS or L-cysteine. The histological study clearly showed an inflammatory state with a loss of tissue organization. Conclusion and implication: We could assume that the phospholipase A 2 and prostaglandins production are involved in H 2 S pro-inflammatory effect in the mouse hind paw. The present study could contribute to understand the role of L-cysteine/H 2 S pathway in inflammatory diseas...|$|E
40|$|The venoms of Bothrops asper (BaV) and Bothrops jararaca (BjV), two of {{the most}} {{medically}} important poisonous snakes of Latin America, cause pronounced oedema in the victims through poorly understood mechanisms. In the present study, we examined the possible role of cyclooxygenases (COX) in the genesis of mouse paw oedema caused by BaV and BjV injections. BaV at 2. 5 μg/paw and BjV at 0. 75 μg/paw induced significant oedema that persisted for up to 6 h following subplantar injection. Treatment with indomethacin (2 mg/kg), rofecoxib, (10 mg/kg), or dexamethasone (2 mg/kg) significantly reduced the BaV- and BjV-induced <b>oedema</b> <b>formation.</b> Treatment with SC- 560 (30 mg/kg) significantly reduced the <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> induced by BjV but had no effect on that induced by BaV. Both venoms induced significant increases in the levels of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) and the expression of COX- 1 and COX- 2 in paw tissue. The peak of <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> and PGE 2 release correlated with marked expression of COX- 2 in the paw tissue. These results demonstrate that injection of BaV and BjV results in a rapid increase in <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> that is, at least partially, mediated by arachidonic acid metabolites formed by COX- 2. In the case of BjV, COX- 1 -derived prostanoids also appear to contribute significantly to the inflammatory changes.

A 25 -year-old pregnant female presented at term to her local district general hospital in Madagascar after 28 hours of labour, having travelled 30 km on foot.

Upon delivery, the infant was noted to have gross swelling, ecchymosis and cherry red discolouration in the right forearm. Mother and child remained otherwise well. The injury was treated conservatively without dressings, leaving the arm to open air. Routine prophylactic antibiotics were administered to the infant given the history of prolonged rupture of membranes.

On light microscopy, all the test rats showed exudative lesions in the lungs consisting of eosinophilic alveolar coagulum, intra-alveolar haemorrhage, interstitial fibrosis, and a proliferation of mast cells. Enlarged and proliferated cells were seen to line the alveolar walls or lie free within the alveolar spaces. Electron microscopy showed these cells to be enlarged granular pneumocytes containing enlarged, electron-dense, lamellar secretory inclusions. Scanty macrophages were also seen in the alveolar spaces, in which excessive numbers of myelin figures and lattices were seen: these structures resembled phospholipid membranes and were probably related to pulmonary surfactant. We think that proliferation of granular pneumocytes is a non-specific reaction of the alveolar walls to injury. The alveolar-capillary wall showed interstitial <b>oedema</b> with the <b>formation</b> of intraluminal endothelial vesicles, probably representing the early ultrastructural phase of pulmonary oedema, and more likely to be an effect of the pulmonary hypertension than its cause...|$|R

Using an ex vivo rat whole blood assay, FR 122047 (0. 032 [*]–[*] 3. 2 [*]mg[*]kg− 1) inhibited COX- 1 -derived thromboxane (TX) B 2 production with ED 50 value of 0. 059 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, indicating that it was orally active, but did not inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin (PG) E 2 production derived by COX- 2. Oral administration of FR 122047 showed a dose-dependent anti-inflammatory effect in rat CIA with ED 50 value of 0. 56 [*]mg[*]kg− 1. This drug also dose dependently suppressed the levels of PGE 2 and TXB 2 in CIA rat paws with ED 50 values of 0. 24 and 0. 13 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, respectively. FR 122047 had no effect in rat AIA model. In contrast, indomethacin, a non-selective COX inhibitor, was anti-inflammatory and reduced the formation of PGs in AIA rat paws. Unlike indomethacin, chronic treatment of FR 122047 did not damage the stomach mucosa in CIA rats. These results demonstrate that COX- 1 contributes to the <b>oedema</b> and the <b>formation</b> of PGE 2 and TXB 2 in rat CIA model, but not in rat AIA model. We conclude that FR 122047 has an orally active and anti-inflammatory effect mediated by inhibition of PGE 2 and TXB 2 produced by COX- 1 at a site of inflammation induced by type II collagen {{and it may be}} a useful tool for studying the involvement of COX- 1 in various in vivo models of inflammation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: {{approximately}} 70 % {{of patients}} with chronic critical limb ischaemia (CLI) show clinical signs of oedema in the distal leg and foot. The primary aim of the present investigation was to quantify this oedema. In addition we investigated whether <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> {{could be due to}} deep venous thrombosis (DVT). Methods: fifteen patients with unilateral CLI and oedema were studied, four males and 11 females, {{with a mean age of}} 77 ± 10. 3 years. Water displacement volumetry (WDV) was used to measure limb volume. Colour duplex ultrasound (CDU) and venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP) were applied to exclude functionally significant DVT. Blood chemistry was analysed to screen for some causative factors of generalised <b>oedema</b> <b>formation.</b> Results: the mean volume of the limbs with CLI was 9 % greater than the contralateral limbs (1279 ± 325 ml vs. 1179 ± 298 ml). None of the patients had functionally significant DVT. The mean plasma albumin concentration was reduced at 28. 5 ± 6. 6 g/l. Conclusion: a significantly reduced plasma albumin concentration cannot be regarded as a causative factor, since the oedema is unilateral. The aetiology of <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> is probably multifactorial, and further investigations are under progress to elucidate relevant pathogenetic factors...|$|E

40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated {{receptor}}s (PPARs) {{are members}} of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors that are related to retinoid, steroid and thyroid hormone receptors. The PPAR-g receptor subtype appears to play a pivotal role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and inflammation. The thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone (Avandia) is a peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor-g (PPAR-g) agonist, that was recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of type II diabetes mellitus. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of rosiglitazone in animal models of acute inflammation (carrageenan-induced paw oedema and carrageenan-induced pleurisy). We report {{here for the first time}} that rosiglitazone (given at 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg i. p. concomitantly with carrageenan injection in the paw oedema model, or at 3, 10 or 30 mg/kg i. p. 15 min before carrageenan administration in the pleurisy model) exerts potent anti-inflammatory effects (e. g. inhibition of paw <b>oedema,</b> pleural exudate <b>formation,</b> mononuclear cell infiltration and histological injury) in vivo. Furthermore, rosiglitazone reduced: (1) the increase in the staining (immunohistochemistry) for nitrotyrosine and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), (2) the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2), intercellular adhesion molecules- 1 (ICAM- 1) and P-selectin in the lungs of carrageenan-treated rats. In order to elucidate whether the protective effect of rosiglitazone is related to activation of the PPAR-g receptor, we also investigated the effect of a PPAR-g antagonist, bisphenol A diglycidyl ether (BADGE), on the protective effects of rosiglitazone. BADGE (30 mg/kg i. p.) administered 30 min prior to treatment with rosiglitazone significantly antagonized the effect of the PPAR-g agonist and thus abolished the anti-inflammatory effects of rosiglitazone. We propose that rosiglitazone and other potent PPAR-g agonists may be useful in the therapy of inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Aims Catheter-based renal nerve {{ablation}} (RNA) using radiofrequency {{energy is}} a novel treatment for drug-resistant essential hypertension. However, the local endothelial and vascular injury induced by RNA has not been characterized, although this importantly determines the long-term safety of the procedure. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables in vivo visualization of morphologic features with a high resolution of 10 - 15 µm. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the morphological features of the endothelial and vascular injury induced by RNA using OCT. Methods and results In a prospective observational study, 32 renal arteries of patients with treatment-resistant hypertension underwent OCT before and after RNA. All pre- and post-procedural OCT pullbacks were evaluated regarding vascular changes such as vasospasm, oedema (notches), dissection, and thrombus formation. Thirty-two renal arteries were evaluated, in which automatic pullbacks were obtained before and after RNA. Vasospasm was observed more often after RNA then before the procedure (0 vs. 42 %, P < 0. 001). A significant decrease in mean renal artery diameter after RNA was documented both with the EnligHTN™ (4. 69 ± 0. 73 vs. 4. 21 ± 0. 87 mm; P < 0. 001) and with the Simplicity® catheter (5. 04 ± 0. 66 vs. 4. 57 ± 0. 88 mm; P < 0. 001). Endothelial-intimal oedema was noted in 96 % of cases after RNA. The presence of thrombus formations was significantly higher after the RNA then before ablation (67 vs. 18 %, P < 0. 001). There was one evidence of arterial dissection after RNA with the Simplicity® catheter, while endothelial and intimal disruptions were noted in two patients with the EnligHTN™ catheter. Conclusion Here we show that diffuse renal artery constriction and local tissue damage at the ablation site with <b>oedema</b> and thrombus <b>formation</b> occur after RNA and that OCT visualizes vascular lesions not apparent on angiography. This suggests that dual antiplatelet therapy may be required during RN...|$|R
40|$|Bacteriochlorin a (BCA), a {{derivative}} of bacteriochlorphyll a, {{is an effective}} photosensitiser in vitro and in vivo. BCA has a major absorption peak at 760 nm where tissue penetration is optimal. This property, together with rapid tissue clearance promises minor skin photosensitivity. The tissue localising and photodynamic properties of BCA were studied using isogeneic RMA mammary tumours, transplanted into subcutaneous tissue in transparent 'sandwich' observation chambers {{on the back of}} WAG/Rij rats. The fluorescence kinetics following an i. v. administration of 20 mg kg- 1 BCA was assessed in blood vessels, tumour and normal tissue. Subsequently, the development of vascular- and tissue damage after a therapeutic light dose (760 nm, 600 J cm- 2) was observed. Fifteen minutes post injection (p. i.), the fluorescence of BCA in the tumour reached a plateau value of 2. 5 times the fluorescence in the normal tissue. From 1 h post injection the tumour fluorescence diminished gradually; after 24 h, the tumour fluorescence signal did not exceed that of the normal tissue. Following photodynamic therapy (PDT), 24 h p. i., complete vascular stasis was observed 2 h post treatment in the tumour only, with subsequent recovery. The presence of viable tumour cells following PDT was assessed by histology and re-transplantation of treated tumour tissue from the chamber into the flank immediately or 7 days after treatment. In both cases tumour regrowth was observed. BCA-PDT (20 mg kg- 1, 760 nm, 100 J cm- 2) 1 h after BCA administration, an interval which gives the optimal differential between tumour and normal tissue, was sufficient to prevent tumour regrowth. However, this only occurred when re-transplantation was performed 7 days after PDT. During PDT, 1 h p. i., vascular damage in tumour and normal tissue was considerable. Complete vascular shut-down was observed in the tumour 2 h after therapy and in the surrounding tissues at 24 h. Circulation damage was associated with vascular spasm and occlusion probably due to thrombi <b>formation.</b> <b>Oedema</b> was notable, especially following PDT with 600 J cm- 2 at 24 h p. i...|$|R

40|$|Increased {{vascular}} permeability and <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> {{constitute a}} major clinical challenge following burns. Several clinical {{studies show that}} leukocytes are systemically activated following burns. Neutrophils {{have the capability to}} increase vascular permeability via mechanisms thought to involve the release of heparin binding protein (HBP). We hypothesised that HBP is elevated in plasma after major burns due to a systemic inflammatory response and investigated plasma-HBP concentrations in 10 severely burned patients daily for 1 week following the burn. Five-fold higher levels in plasma-HBP concentration compared to a control group were detected on the first day after injury, followed by a steep reduction in the time-period that corresponds to {{the last part of the}} hyperpermeability phase. These data are in accordance with the hypothesis that HBP may function as a mediator of the early bum-induced increase in vascular permeability, and call for further studies to confirm a possible cause-and-effect relationship between HBP and <b>oedema</b> <b>formation</b> following burns.

40|$|The role of {{endogenous}} {{nitric oxide}} (NO) in acute inflammation was investigated using two inhibitors of NO synthase (NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester(L-NAME) and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA)) {{as well as}} L- or D-arginine. The effect of test compounds was studied on the carrageenin-induced increase in vascular permeability in rat skin and in dextran- and carrageenin-induced paw oedema. Both L-NAME and L-NMMA dose dependently inhibited the increase in vascular permeability and <b>oedema</b> <b>formation.</b> L- but not D-arginine increased these inflammatory responses and reversed the inhibitory effects of L-NAME and L-NMMA. In dexamethasone-treated rats L-arginine enhanced the dextran-induced oedema and the early phase of carrageenin-induced oedema but did not modify the inhibition by dexamethasone of the late phase of carrageenin-induced oedema. These results suggest that endogenous NO is released {{at the site of}} acute inflammation and modulates <b>oedema</b> <b>formation.</b> Depending on the time course or on the type of inflammation, NO may be predominantly generated by the constitutive or by the inducible NO synthase...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-four {{specific}} pathogen free pigs were inoculated intradermally at the front-right heel bulb with 0. 5 ml of viral suspension containing 10 (6. 0) {{tissue culture}} infectious dose (TCID(50)) with the porcinophillic strain (O/Taiwan/ 97) of {{foot-and-mouth disease virus}} (FMDV) isolated from the epizootic of FMD in Taiwan in 1997. Two pigs were euthanatized at 8 h, 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 15, 21, 26 and 63 days post-inoculation (DPI), and two pigs remained for long-term observation and terminated at 400 DPI. Typical symptoms of depression and inappetence appeared in the inoculated pigs at 1 DPI and subsided by 7 DPI. Vesicles developed in the epidermis over non-inoculated metacarpals joints at 1 DPI and vesicles in the mouth and on the snout were noticed at 2 DPI. Lesions in the feet were characterized by necrosis in the stratum spinosum, intercellular <b>oedema,</b> and vesicle <b>formation</b> accompanied by neutrophilic and mononuclear cells infiltration. Baby hamster kidney- 21 cell cultures were used for virus isolation and viraemia was detected beginning at 1 DPI and persisted till 3 DPI and was no longer detectable when neutralizing antibody (NA) developed at 4 DPI. However, virus was isolated from skin samples from 1 to 12 DPI, from faeces from 2 to 8 DPI, and from 95 % oesophageal-pharyngeal (OP) fluid samples at 8 HPI. Among the samples tested in this study, skin vesicles had the highest virus titre, 10 (8. 63) TCID(50). No virus was isolated from the skin or visceral organs obtained from post-mortem at day 15 after infection and the virus was not detectable from the OP fluid from 12 DPI {{till the end of}} this study (400 DPI). By using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, viral RNA was detected first from the tissues at the inoculation site at 1 DPI, and still detectable at 21 DPI. Neutralizing antibody emerged at 4 DPI and the geometric mean NA titre reached to 1 : 861 and 1 : 1097 at 21 and 301 DPI respectively. The re-growth of hoof began at 21 DPI; however, minimal lesions including remnants of the old hoof were still presented {{at the end of this}} study. These results suggest that monitoring pig's hooves for residual lesions should be part of the FMD diagnosis...|$|R
40|$|Several {{acute and}} chronic {{diseases}} disposes for myocardial oedema and fibrosis, leading to impaired cardiac function, presumably {{as a result}} of an increased chamber stiffness. Mechanisms and adverse effects of both oedema and fibrosis in the heart have only partly been elucidated; however, the temporal and spatial development is still unknown. Objective: The purpose of our study was to: (1) establish an in vivo pulmonary artery (PA) banded model that produces myocardial oedema and fibrosis in both ventricles, and (2) examine the temporal and spatial development of oedema- and subsequent fibrosis formation in both acute and chronic protocols. Methods: A PA-banded model was utilized to elevate the right ventricular (RV) pressure, to subsequently produce both right- and left sided ventricular myocardial oedema and on a longer time scale, fibrosis, in male Wistar rats. The left ventricular (LV) oedema formed due to the drainage system via sinus venosus and the thebesian veins, further exacerbated by lymphatic congestion, allowed us to study the LV itself without interferences from manipulation. Gravimetric wet to dry weight ratio as an index of total tissue water (TTW) and oedema, and hydroxyproline as an indicator of total collagen synthesis and fibrosis formation, were measured in the RV and LV and the septum. Results: Right ventricular developed pressure (RVDP) was significantly elevated in all PA-banded procedures as compared the initial pressure measurements pre-PA-banding and the corresponding sham values. Contraction (dP/dt maximum) and relaxation (dP/dt minimum) of the RV pressure was increased in both acute and chronic experimental PA-banded groups, while heart rate (HR) remained unchanged. No significant increases in TTW or total collagen content was seen until 17 days post-PA-banding (note: n= 1 in each group). Conclusions: Continuously increased RV pressures post-PA-banding demonstrated a marked response to the constriction. The heart seemed to overcome the elevated pressure by increasing cardiac contraction and relaxation (dP/dt). No indication of myocardial <b>oedema</b> or fibrosis <b>formation</b> was seen within the first hour of acute PA-banding. Preliminary data from chronic protocols indicated that myocardial oedema was not developed within 24 hours, but after 17 days post-PA-banding, with subsequent increases in collagen synthesis (note: n= 1 in each group) ...|$|R
40|$|Haemostasis is an {{important}} aspect in neurosurgical operations for the achievement of good outcome. Bipolar coagulation is an extensively used haemostatic technique in modern neurosurgery {{but it may also}} cause iatrogenic brain trauma due to thermal injury. Published studies on coagulation-induced brain injury on a histological level are, however, limited. The present study aimed at investigating the extent of inflammatory and glial responses caused by different settings of bipolar coagulation using an animal model. It also investigated whether and how pre-operative treatment with dexamethasone or progesterone, both known to have neuro-protective effects, would modulate gliosis and macrophage infiltration induced by bipolar coagulation. The study consisted of two parts. The first part investigated the astrocytic and macrophage responses after bipolar coagulation at different power settings. 45 Sprague-Dawley rats received craniotomy, followed by bipolar coagulation at different power output settings (mock operation as control, 20 W and 40 W) over the rat cortex for a standardized duration of two seconds. On day 3, day 7 and day 28, brain sections were assessed by immunohistochemical staining for GFAP (astrocytes) and ED 1 (macrophages). Quantification of outcome by random field cell counting under light microscopy was performed. The second part of the study used another 45 male Sprague-Dawley rats, divided into three treatment groups: Group 1 received the vehicle agents only (Control); Group 2 received progesterone 20 mg/kg; Group 3 received dexamethasone 1 mg/kg. All treatments were given intraperitoneally two hours before craniotomy. The animals received bipolar coagulation at 40 W for a standardized duration of two seconds. On day 1, 3 and 7, brain sections were assessed by immunohistochemical staining for GFAP and ED 1. Quantification of outcome by random field cell counting under light microscopy was performed. T 2 -weighted magnetic resonance imaging for the animals on day 3 was also performed. The results showed that bipolar coagulation was associated with significant glial and inflammatory responses that correlated with power output. Progesterone and dexamethasone were both effective in reducing the glial hypertrophy and macrophage infiltration associated with bipolar coagulation. Dexamethasone had an additional advantage of reducing brain <b>oedema</b> and cavity <b>formation.</b> The findings suggested that progesterone and dexamethasone could be further explored as potential protective and/or remedial agents for bipolar coagulation-induced brain trauma sustained during neurosurgical procedures. published_or_final_versionSurgeryMasterMaster of Research in Medicin...|$|R
