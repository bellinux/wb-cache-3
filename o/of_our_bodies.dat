25|$|Society often {{constructs}} our behaviours and beliefs, such {{as personal}} developments, physiological and psychological interactions, {{and the common}} “perception <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> {{as a reflection of}} self worth”. Body image struggles have been prevalent for many centuries now, especially with the rapid constant shifts in ideal body types. In the past, norms were typically set by cultural beliefs, genders, or social standings. Despite these being prevalent today, changes in the fashion and media industries are other influences at hand.|$|E
25|$|Hiding from Humanity extends Nussbaum's work {{in moral}} {{psychology}} {{to probe the}} arguments for including two emotions—shame and disgust—as legitimate bases for legal judgments. Nussbaum argues that individuals tend to repudiate their bodily imperfection or animality through the projection of fears about contamination. This cognitive response is in itself irrational, because we cannot transcend the animality <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>bodies.</b> Noting how projective disgust has wrongly justified group subordination (mainly of women, Jews, and homosexuals), Nussbaum ultimately discards disgust as a reliable basis of judgment.|$|E

2500|$|A {{separate}} and identifiable field of health advocacy {{grew out of}} the patient rights movement of the 1970s. [...] This was clearly a period in which a [...] "rights-based" [...] approach provided the foundation of much social action. [...] The initial [...] "inspiration" [...] for a [...] "patient bill of rights" [...] came from an advocacy organization, the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO). [...] In 1970, the NWRO list of patients' rights was incorporated into the Joint Commission's accreditation standards for hospitals, and, interestingly, reprinted and distributed by the Boston Women's Health Book Collective—authors <b>of</b> <b>Our</b> <b>Bodies,</b> Ourselves—as part of their women's health education program. [...] The preamble to the NWRO document became the basis for the Patient Bill of Rights adopted by the American Hospital Association in 1972.|$|E
2500|$|Wodiczko began {{developing}} {{his public}} projections in 1980 interfacing the facades of urban architecture – whether public monuments, public buildings, or corporate architecture – {{with images of}} the body to juxtapose the physical space of architecture with the psycho-social space of the public realm. [...] “In the process of our socialization,” the artist writes, “the very first contact with a public building is no less important than the moment of social confrontation with the father, through which our sexual role and place in society [...] constructed. Early socialization through patriarchal sexual discipline is extended by the later socialization through the institutional architecturalization <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>bodies.</b> Thus the spirit of the father never dies, continuously living as it does in the building which was, is, and will be embodying, structuring, mastering, representing, and reproducing his ‘eternal’ and ‘universal’ presence as a patriarchal wisdom-body of power.” ...|$|E
2500|$|By [...] "necessary connection", Hume {{means the}} power or force which {{necessarily}} ties one idea to another. He rejects {{the notion that}} any sensible qualities are necessarily conjoined, since that would mean we could know something prior to experience. Unlike his predecessors, Berkeley and Locke, Hume rejects the idea that volitions or impulses of the will may be inferred to necessarily connect to the actions they produce by way of {{some sense of the}} power of the will. He reasons that, 1. if we knew the nature of this power, then the mind-body divide would seem totally unmysterious to us; 2. if we had immediate knowledge of this mysterious power, then we would be able to intuitively explain why it is that we can control some parts <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> (e.g., our hands or tongues), and not others (e.g., the liver or heart); 3. we have no immediate knowledge of the powers which allow an impulse of volition to create an action (e.g., of the [...] "muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits" [...] which are the immediate cause of an action). (Hume 1974:353-354) He produces like arguments against the notion that we have knowledge of these powers as they affect the mind alone. (Hume 1974:355-356) He also argues in brief against the idea that causes are mere occasions of the will of some god(s), a view associated with the philosopher Nicolas Malebranche.

2500|$|It may be possible, then, {{that our}} intuitions {{about the role}} of our {{conscious}} [...] "intentions" [...] have led us astray; it may be the case that we have confused correlation with causation by believing that conscious awareness necessarily causes the body's movement. This possibility is bolstered by findings in neurostimulation, brain damage, but also research into introspection illusions. Such illusions show that humans do not have full access to various internal processes. The discovery that humans possess a determined will would have implications for moral responsibility. Neuroscientist and author Sam Harris believes that we are mistaken in believing the intuitive idea that intention initiates actions. In fact, Harris is even critical of the idea that free will is [...] "intuitive": he says careful introspection can cast doubt on free will. Harris argues [...] "Thoughts simply arise in the brain. What else could they do? The truth about us is even stranger than we may suppose: The illusion of free will is itself an illusion". Philosopher Walter Jackson Freeman III nevertheless talks about the power of even unconscious systems and actions to change the world according to our intentions. He writes [...] "our intentional actions continually flow into the world, changing the world and the relations <b>of</b> <b>our</b> <b>bodies</b> to it. This dynamic system is the self in each of us, it is the agency in charge, not our awareness, which is constantly {{trying to keep up with}} what we do." [...] To Freeman, the power of intention and action can be independent of awareness.|$|E
