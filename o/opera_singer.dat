5|$|Hergé's {{decision}} {{to name a}} character Topolino was a reference to Walt Disney, whose character of Mickey Mouse was known as Topolino in Italian. Hergé included a reference to his friend and colleague, the former <b>opera</b> <b>singer</b> Edgar P. Jacobs, in the story, adding a figure named Jacobini to the billing on the opera performance alongside Castafiore. He also inserted a cameo {{of himself as a}} reporter into the final scene of the story.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} of Bianca Casfafiore in the story– a famous <b>opera</b> <b>singer,</b> {{pursued by the}} press, and changing her outfit for every occasion– {{was influenced by the}} life of the <b>opera</b> <b>singer</b> Maria Callas. One of the new characters that Hergé introduced into the story was the stonemason Arthur Bolt (M. Boullu in the original French version), whose characterisation was based on a real individual who worked for Hergé. Hergé's {{depiction of}} the paparazzi within the story may have been influenced by his own repeat encounters with the press throughout his career. The reporter and the photographer, Christopher Willoughby-Droupe and Marco Rizotto (Jean-Loup de la Battelerie and Walter Rizotto respectively in the original French version) of the Paris Flash, are introduced into the series here, and would later be retroactively added into a re-drawing of The Black Island (1938) by Bob de Moor, also making a reappearance in Tintin and the Picaros (1976). The idea of having a proposed marriage between Castafiore and Haddock was based on a reader's suggestion that Haddock marry.|$|E

In the aftermath, Louis's widowed mother raises him {{on the history of}} her family and tells him how, unlike other aristocratic titles, the dukedom of Chalfont can descend through female heirs. Louis's only childhood friends are Sibella and her brother, the children of a local doctor.|$|E

As Countessa Anne Filippini, she was Australia's first female symphony orchestra conductor.
