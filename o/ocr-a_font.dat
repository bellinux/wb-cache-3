5000|$|The OCR-A {{subheading}} contains six characters {{taken from}} the <b>OCR-A</b> <b>font</b> described in the ISO 1073-1:1976 standard: , , , , , and [...] The OCR bow tie is given the informative alias [...] "unique asterisk".|$|E
50|$|As metal type {{gave way}} to {{computer-based}} typesetting, Tor Lillqvist used MetaFont to describe the <b>OCR-A</b> <b>font.</b> That definition was subsequently improved by Richard B. Wales. Their work is available from CTAN.|$|E
50|$|Along {{with the}} Westminster, MICR, and <b>OCR-A</b> <b>fonts,</b> the slashed zero {{became one of}} the things {{associated}} with hacker culture in the 1980s. Some cartoons depicted computer users talking in binary code with 1s and 0s using a slashed zero for the 0.|$|R
5000|$|<b>OCR-A</b> is a <b>font</b> {{that arose}} {{in the early days}} of {{computer}} optical character recognition when there was a need for a font that could be recognized not only by the computers of that day, but also by humans. OCR-A uses simple, thick strokes to form recognizable characters.The font is monospaced (fixed-width), with the printer required to place glyphs [...] cm ( [...] inch) apart, and the reader required to accept any spacing between [...] cm ( [...] inch) and [...] cm ( [...] inch).|$|R
50|$|The USAF 1951 {{resolution}} {{test target}} {{consists of a}} pattern of 3 bar targets. Often found covering a range of 0.25 to 228 cycles/mm. Each group consists of six elements. The group is designated by a group number (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, etc.) which is the power to which 2 should be raised to obtain the spatial frequency of the first element (e.g., group -2 is 0.25 line pairs per millimeter). Each element is the 6th root of 2 smaller than the preceding element in the group (e.g. element 1 is 2^0, element 2 is 2^(-1/6), element 3 is 2(-1/3), etc.). By reading off the group and element number of the first element which cannot be resolved, the limiting resolution may be determined by inspection. The complex numbering system and use of a look-up chart can be avoided by use of an improved but not standardized layout chart, which labels the bars and spaces directly in cycles/mm using <b>OCR-A</b> extended <b>font.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>OCR-A</b> <b>font</b> was {{standardized}} by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI)as ANSI X3.17-1981. X3.4 {{has since}} become the INCITS and the OCR-A standard is now called ISO 1073-1:1976. There is also a German standard for OCR-A called DIN 66008.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{innovations}} {{did take}} place {{during this period}} however. The brilliant lettering artist Charles H. Hughes was engaged to produce {{a new version of}} the popular Century Type that would reproduce the same in offset and letterpress and the result was the lovely Century Nova (1965). [...] ATF also produced the first optically scanning typeface, <b>OCR-A</b> <b>font,</b> in 1969 and this remains the standard on printed bank checks to this day.|$|E
5000|$|Although optical {{character}} recognition technology has advanced {{to the point where}} such simple fonts are no longer necessary, the <b>OCR-A</b> <b>font</b> has remained in use. Its usage remains widespread in the encoding of cheques around the world. Some lockbox companies still insist that the account number and amount owed on a bill return form be printed in OCR-A. [...] Also, because of its unusual look, it is sometimes used in advertising and display graphics.|$|E
