5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Duigan desired command of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), which was to be raised for service in Europe.

Major General Bernard Freyberg was instead appointed commander of 2NZEF, and Duigan's term as CGS was extended. Throughout 1940, Duigan worked to ensure the continued support and reinforcement of 2NZEF, and oversaw the reintroduction of conscription.

Later, in the last year of his life and with the Second World War under way, he published two booklets on post war reconstruction, Britain Must Rebuild and Paths to Peace.
