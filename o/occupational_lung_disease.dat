40|$|This book {{presents}} maps showing geographic distributions (by {{health service}} area) of mortality associated with selected respiratory conditions that together represent nearly all respiratory diseases. For categories of traditional <b>occupational</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> mapped in this atlas (i. e., the pneumoconioses, including coal workers' pneumoconiosis, asbestosis, silicosis, byssinosis, and other and unspecified pneumoconioses), nearly all cases {{are attributable to}} hazardous occupational exposure. NIOSH has previously published maps showing geographic distributions (by county) of pneumoconiosis mortality in the United States (NIOSH 1996). For other respiratory disease categories mapped in this atlas, cases frequently occur {{in the absence of}} hazardous occupational exposure, and smaller proportions of cases [...] much smaller for some disease categories [...] are therefore considered attributable to occupational exposure. Nevertheless, for each of the disease categories mapped in this atlas, occupational causes have been documented.

Great efforts have been made in investigations of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO) as a marker of various diseases and the possible causal pathways for NO to contribute to the diseases, whereas little research is available to elucidate the possibility of eNO as a non-invasive alternative to reflect silica-induced harmful effects.

In this paper, we have used the Case Based Reasoning methodology to develop a {{clinical decision support}} system prototype for supporting diagnosis of <b>occupational</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases.</b> 127 cases were collected for 14 <b>occupational</b> chronic <b>lung</b> <b>diseases,</b> which contains 26 symptoms.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{occurrence}} of <b>occupational</b> <b>lung</b> <b>diseases</b> is decreasing due to improvements in occupational health in recent years; however, silicosis and its complications remain important occupational health problems. We {{have studied the}} role of emphysema and bullae as predictive factors of secondary spontaneous pneumothorax in acute and accelerated silicosis. Methods This study was carried out using questionnaire items on occupational history and conventional computed tomography of lungs. Differences between two groups (silicosis with and without secondary spontaneous pneumothorax) in terms of age, interval of exposure-diagnosis and therefore silica exposure duration were assessed by independent t -test. Fisher's exact {{test was used to}} determine the association between secondary spontaneous pneumothorax and both emphysema and bullae. Results We found a significant association between secondary spontaneous pneumothorax and bullae in acute and accelerated silicosis. Conclusion Pneumothorax in silicosis could be attributed to previous bullae. </p...|$|R
