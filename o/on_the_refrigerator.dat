500|$|Authorities have {{acknowledged}} {{that since the}} exact cause of Bella's death remains unknown, asserting that it was homicide to a jury could be [...] "difficult to prove." [...] Rachelle Bond alleged that McCarthy had punched the toddler in the stomach multiple times after claiming Bella was a [...] "demon", {{and that he was}} the sole perpetrator of the murder. Prosecutors of McCarthy allege that Bella was murdered in one of many abusive occasions after she had been uncooperative about going to bed. Citing that McCarthy had decided to [...] "calm the child down," [...] they say Rachelle had not entered the room alongside her boyfriend. When she did enter, they say she witnessed him near the girl's body, which was [...] "swollen and gray," [...] indicating she was deceased. Rachelle Bond's attorney claims McCarthy threatened to murder her client if she contacted authorities. She also maintained that Rachelle was not involved with hiding the victim's body, which had initially been placed in garbage bags and concealed in a refrigerator. Bond later admitted to this accusation as part of a future plea deal. A cadaver dog brought to the house later indicated that it smelled something <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> Bond contradicted the belief that the body was placed on Deer Island; she stated that McCarthy had [...] placed the body in a weighted duffel bag and disposed of it in the water, suggesting it drifted to the location where it was found.|$|E

Eighty percent of Cold War-era brats described their father as [...] "authoritarian" [...] or desiring to exercise complete control over their lives. They described their military parent as rigid in discipline, inflexible, intolerant of dissent, disapproving of non-conforming behavior, insensitive to their emotions, and not accepting of personal privacy. A Cold War era military psychologist, publishing in the American Journal of Psychology, reviewed the parents of patients who came to his clinic, and concluded that 93% of patients came from military families that were overly authoritarian.|$|E

40|$|NASA s Johnson Space Center (JSC) Building 32 houses {{two large}} thermal-vacuum {{chambers}} (Chamber A and Chamber B). Within these chambers are liquid nitrogen shrouds {{to provide a}} thermal environment and helium panels which operate at 20 K to provide cryopumping. Some amount of air leakage into the chambers during tests is inevitable. This causes "air fouling" of the helium panel surfaces due to {{the components of the}} air that adhere to the panels. The air fouling causes the emittance of the helium panels to increase during tests. The increase in helium panel emittance increases <b>the</b> heat load <b>on</b> <b>the</b> helium <b>refrigerator</b> that supplies <b>the</b> 20 K helium for those panels.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} the technical details and applications of an AR system developed {{by two of}} the authors as a case example. This is an initial usability test of the system to check if the proposed system works properly as intended. Based <b>on</b> <b>the</b> result, the system will be further elaborated. The system is employed with <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> example to support wayfinding and access to status information of produce in <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator.</b> <b>The</b> augmented green arrows explicitly indicate the direction the user should take to reach a destination. The user merely needs to scan each tracking marker with an iPad to retrieve the arrow to the next milestone. Further, all incoming food to <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator</b> will be barcode scanned by an iPhone/iPad and relevant information recorded for future use. For example, <b>on</b> opening <b>the</b> <b>refrigerator,</b> all products that have been pre-tracked could have a virtual label floating beside them, indicating the expiration date, quantity remaining, etc. All these augmented labels can be easily viewed with an iPhone/iPad; furthermore, the information can be modified so that the next person can pick up any comments left in the AR data by previous people.|$|R

In the present work an experimental investigation is taken up to find <b>the</b> effect <b>on</b> frosting characteristics for a domestic refrigerator chiller by removing the bottom plate of the chiller and compare them with that of the four sided chiller compartment.
