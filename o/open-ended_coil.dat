40|$|Recently {{generation}} of strong magnetic (B) fields {{has been demonstrated}} in capacitor coils heated by high power laser pulses [S. Fujioka et al., Sci. Rep. 3, 1170 (2013) ]. This paper will present a direct measurement of B field generated with an <b>open-ended</b> <b>coil</b> target driven by a nanosecond laser pulse using ultrafast proton radiography. The radiographs are analyzed with particle-tracing simulations. The B field at the coil center is inferred to be ∼ 50  T at an irradiance of ∼ 5  ×  1014  W·cm− 2. The B field generation is attributed to the background cold electron flow pointing to the laser focal spot, where a target potential is induced due to the escape of energetic electrons...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we present {{near-field}} wireless sensing of single and multiple <b>open-ended</b> micro <b>coils</b> using an electrically small loop antenna. Wirelessly characterized parameters of <b>open-ended</b> micro <b>coils</b> include its resonance frequency, quality factor and inductance. Moreover a wireless frequency-dependent analytical model was developed. Micro coil inductance was {{extracted from the}} wirelessly measured signal using a constraint-based least-squares approach. Wireless measurements and analytical fit of micro coils are in strong agreement which validates the analytical model. Finite element method (FEM) simulations of the coupled system were done in COMSOL Multiphysics...|$|R
