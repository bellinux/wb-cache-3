5|$|Willard Spiegelman, in {{his study}} of Romantic poetry, {{suggests}} that the indolence of the poem arises from the narrator's reluctance to apply himself to the labour associated with poetic creation. Some critics provide other explanations, and William Ober claims that Keats's description of indolence may have arisen from the use <b>of</b> <b>opium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Koskov, Necros, Kara, and {{the captive}} Bond fly to a Soviet {{air base in}} Afghanistan, where Koskov betrays Kara and imprisons her along with Bond. The pair escape {{and in doing so}} free a {{condemned}} prisoner, Kamran Shah, leader of the local Mujahideen. Bond and Milovy discover that Koskov is using Soviet funds to buy a massive shipment <b>of</b> <b>opium</b> from the Mujahideen, intending to keep the profits with enough left over to supply the Soviets with their arms and buy Western arms from Whitaker.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Wijnhamer, known as PahWongso, was {{recognised}} in West Java for his promotion of social causes. These included promoting monogamy {{and faith in}} western medicine, as well as combating gambling and the use <b>of</b> <b>opium</b> and alcohol. In conveying his messages he often used the Sundanese wayang golek (a form of rod puppet), as the local people were generally unable to read. He was able to speak Dutch, Malay, and Javanese fluently, and had some command of Chinese and Japanese. This social work was funded predominantly from PahWongso's day job, selling fried peanuts (kacang goreng).|$|E

2500|$|Licit {{cultivation}} <b>of</b> the <b>opium</b> poppy {{occurs on}} farms {{controlled by the}} Ministry of Agriculture and the National Drug Administration Bureau of the State Council. According to United Nations (U.N.) International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) data, China produces approximately [...] <b>of</b> licit <b>opium</b> per year {{for use in the}} domestic pharmaceutical industry. China reports that none <b>of</b> this <b>opium</b> is exported.|$|R
5|$|From {{its base}} in India, the Company {{had also been}} engaged in an {{increasingly}} profitable opium export trade to China since the 1730s. This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. In 1839, the confiscation by the Chinese authorities at Canton of 20,000 chests <b>of</b> <b>opium</b> led Britain to attack China in the First Opium War, and resulted in the seizure by Britain of Hong Kong Island, at that time a minor settlement.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{maritime}} fur trade in Southern China by itself was probably not great. The Canton trade as a whole had limited effect on China, mostly limited to the tea growers of Fujian, the silk producers of Nanjing, the craftsmen of Canton, and various middlemen, and merchants. The ruling Manchus kept foreign trade by ship at bay. It was restricted to Canton, and even there was allowed only outside the city walls. China was generally self-sufficient. The main {{effect of the}} Old China Trade was an increased import <b>of</b> <b>opium</b> and related outflow of specie, which resulted in China being incorporated into the capitalist world system after 1830. However, the maritime fur trade played a minor role in this process.|$|E
5|$|Wilberforce {{had planned}} to {{introduce}} a motion giving notice that he would bring forward a bill for the Abolition of the Slave Trade during the 1789 parliamentary session. However, in January 1788, he was taken ill with a probable stress-related condition, now thought to be ulcerative colitis. It was several months before {{he was able to}} resume work, and he spent time convalescing at Bath and Cambridge. His regular bouts of gastrointestinal illnesses precipitated the use of moderate quantities <b>of</b> <b>opium,</b> which proved effective in alleviating his condition, and which he continued to use {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
50|$|The Anglo-Oriental Society for the Suppression <b>of</b> the <b>Opium</b> Trade, {{generally}} {{known by}} the somewhat shorter name of Society for the Suppression <b>of</b> the <b>Opium</b> Trade (SSOT), was a British lobbying group {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries, opposed to the opium trade.|$|R

5|$|Despite Singapore's growing importance, the {{administration}} governing {{the island was}} understaffed, ineffectual and unconcerned with {{the welfare of the}} populace. Administrators were usually posted from India and were unfamiliar with local culture and languages. While the population had quadrupled during 1830 to 1867, the size of the civil service in Singapore had remained unchanged. Most people had no access to public health services and diseases such as cholera and smallpox caused severe health problems, especially in overcrowded working-class areas. As a result of {{the administration}}'s ineffectiveness and the predominantly male, transient, and uneducated nature of the population, the society was lawless and chaotic. In 1850 there were only twelve police officers in the city of nearly 60,000 people. Prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse (particularly <b>of</b> <b>opium)</b> were widespread. Chinese criminal secret societies (analogous to modern-day triads) were extremely powerful, and some had tens of thousands of members. Turf wars between rival societies occasionally led to hundreds of deaths and attempts to suppress them had limited success.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, Wong {{opposed the}} sale <b>of</b> <b>opium</b> and the {{building}} of a casino in the Sibu area, proposed by the Brooke government. He was later expelled by the Sarawak government due to failure to repay debt. Wong and his family left Sibu in July 1904. Rev. James Hoover took over Wong's role to manage the Sibu settlement. He introduced the first rubber seedlings to Sibu in 1904. He build a Methodist church in 1905. The church was later renamed to Masland Methodist church in 1925. Hoover stayed at the Rajang basin for another 31 years until his death from malaria in 1935 at Kuching general hospital. The construction of Lau King Howe Hospital was completed in 1936 to accommodate the growing population of Sibu. The hospital served Sibu people for 58 years until 1994 when a new hospital was constructed in Sibu.|$|E
5|$|In late 1933-early 1934, a major strain {{was placed}} on German-Japanese {{relations}} when the German ambassador to Japan, when Ambassador Herbert von Dirksen appointed Ferdinand Heye, a Nazi Party member and a disreputable German businessman convicted by a Chinese court <b>of</b> <b>opium</b> smuggling in 1927 the Special German Trade Commissioner for Manchukuo. The Japanese attached much importance {{to the question of}} recognizing Manchukuo, which was seen as a litmus test for whatever one was a true friend of Japan or of China. Heye attempted with the support of Dirksen to have the Japanese give him a monopoly of exporting soybeans from Manchukuo, in exchange for which he promised to have Germany recognize Manchukuo. The ambitious Heye, having won the friendship of the Kwantung Army by promising that he would have the Reich recognize Manchukuo, then attempted to use his position as German Trade Commissioner to Manchukuo to secure a monopoly on all German investments in Manchukuo. The attempts of Heye and Dirksen to have Germany recognize Manchukuo involved them in a dispute with Neurath who preferred to keep Germany's special relationship it had established with the Kuomintang regime in China going, and who knew well that the Chinese would be extremely offended if Germany recognized Manchukuo. The Heye affair caused much bad feelings on both sides, and was ended in February 1935 with the victory of Neurath when Hitler disallowed Heye and his promises he made.|$|E

5|$|During the 1820s, Duyệt's {{continued}} cultivated {{of relations}} with the immigrant Chinese community that had settled in southern Vietnam in large numbers brought him into conflict with Minh Mạng. The general had adopted a Chinese immigrant merchant as his son and gave him favours, including appointing him to position {{of the body that}} regulated trade. The Japanese historian Shimao concluded that Duyệt and his entourage were given financial rewards and gifts from the Chinese merchants in return for favourable treatment by government officials. It was also pointed out that another of Duyet's men was himself a businessman who had a Chinese agent. At the time, southern Vietnam was producing rice in plentiful quantities but export was banned by Minh Mạng, but prices in Vietnam, which were lower than those overseas, kept rising by 50–100% {{in various parts of the}} country in five years. In the meantime, the opium supply kept on increasing. It was thought that Chinese merchants, whom Duyệt patronised, were illegally exporting rice at higher prices, and then bringing back opium during return journeys along with incoming immigrants. For his part, the general disagreed with the prevailing view held by the emperor, and said that people of both races were engaging in illegal trading, as well as blaming the incoming immigrants' personal addictions rather than the Chinese merchants for bringing in opium. The historian Nola Cooke said that Duyet's viewpoint was more plausible and speculated that the emperor's stance was borne more out of a fear of the consequences of a disproportionate Chinese influence on the country than the reality of illegal trading. Duyệt wanted to further give tax concessions to newly arrived Chinese immigrants that were deemed to be impoverished to encourage immigration and speed up development of the region, something that the emperor was sceptical of, on the reasoning that it was difficult to genuinely determine who was in need and that the concession system was therefore open to rorting. Nevertheless, Duyệt disobeyed Minh Mạng and tax concessions were granted. Because of their involvement in the illegal exportation of rice and importation <b>of</b> <b>opium,</b> Minh Mạng tried to ban the Chinese from engaging in sea trade in 1827, but this was easily circumvented by the merchants, who exploited their contacts with Duyệt and used fraudulent registrations, often under the name of Vietnamese wives. It was not until Duyệt died that Minh Mạng was able to crack down on fraudulent sea trade.|$|E

25|$|He campaigned {{against the}} opium trade, and in 1883 went on an {{investigation}} to the Chinese camps in Southern New South Wales.

In June that year Quong Tart also tried to win support for a ban <b>of</b> <b>opium</b> in Melbourne and Ballarat, Victoria. In 1887, he presented a second petition to parliament, and produced a pamphlet titled A Plea for the Abolition of the Importation <b>of</b> <b>Opium.</b>|$|E

25|$|Following China's {{defeat in}} the Second Opium War in 1858, China was forced to legalize opium and began massive {{domestic}} production. Importation <b>of</b> <b>opium</b> peaked in 1879 at 6,700 tons, and by 1906, China was producing 85 percent of the world's opium, some 35,000 tons, and 27 percent of its adult male population regularly used opium13.5million people consuming 39,000 tons <b>of</b> <b>opium</b> yearly. From 1880 {{to the beginning of}} the Communist era, the British attempted to discourage the use <b>of</b> <b>opium</b> in China, but this effectively promoted the use of , heroin, and cocaine, further exacerbating the problem of addiction.|$|E
25|$|A Second Opium War fought by Britain and France against China {{lasted from}} 1856 until 1860 {{and led to}} the Treaty of Tientsin, which legalised the {{importation}} <b>of</b> <b>opium.</b> Legalisation stimulated domestic Chinese opium production and increased the importation <b>of</b> <b>opium</b> from Turkey and Persia. This increased competition for the Chinese market led to India's reducing its opium output and diversifying its exports.|$|E
25|$|There were {{no legal}} {{restrictions}} on the importation or use <b>of</b> <b>opium</b> in the United States until the San Francisco Opium Den Ordinance, which banned dens for public smoking <b>of</b> <b>opium</b> in 1875, a measure fueled by anti-Chinese sentiment and the perception that whites were starting to frequent the dens. This was followed by an 1891 California law requiring that narcotics carry warning labels and that their sales be recorded in a registry; amendments to the California Pharmacy and Poison Act in 1907 made {{it a crime to}} sell opiates without a prescription, and bans on possession <b>of</b> <b>opium</b> or opium pipes in 1909 were enacted.|$|E
