25|$|The {{use of an}} {{infrared}} sensor to detect position can cause some detection problems when other infrared sources are around, such as incandescent light bulbs or candles. This can be easily alleviated by using fluorescent lights around the Wii, which emit little to no infrared light. Innovative users have used other sources of IR light as Sensor Bar substitutes such {{as a pair of}} flashlights and a pair of candles. The Wii Remote picks up traces of heat from the sensor, then transmits it to the Wii console to control the pointer <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>screen.</b> Such substitutes for the Sensor Bar illustrate the fact that a pair of non-moving lights provide continuous calibration of the direction that the Wii Remote is pointing and its physical location relative to the light sources. There is no way to calibrate the position of the cursor relative to where the user is pointing the controller without the two stable reference sources of light provided by the Sensor Bar or substitutes. Third-party wireless sensor bars have also been released, which have been popular with users of Wii emulators since the official Sensor Bar utilizes a proprietary connector to connect to the Wii console.|$|E

5000|$|Mobile {{applications}} are a unique, fast developing {{information and communication}} technology. They are made to be user friendly, cheap, downloadable and functional in most mobile phones. Research has been made on the usage of mobile applications and how it affects people in society by Matt Gardiner, an ophthalmologist at Mass. Eye and Ear. What he found was people’s upper body muscles tend to tense up, face muscles contort, and headaches happen as they stare at the screen {{for a long period}} of time. People normally blink about 15 times per minute. However while using smartphones, that rate drops in half, causing dry eyes. An associate of Gardiner's, Gang Luo has then created an app called [...] "SuperVision Magnifier" [...] which brightens the images <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>screen</b> and uses the phone camera to provide more light for reading.|$|E

50|$|To {{play the}} game, you must first {{purchase}} the Starter Kit, containing a DNA extractor gun, a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and the Xtractaurs installation CD. You first must insert the CD into your computer {{to install the}} Xtractaurs software. Once installed, you can open the software, create an account (You must have Broadband Internet connection to play online), and can plug in your DNA extractor gun with a cable on {{the handle of the}} gun, which ends in a male USB plug. You are now ready for extraction. Your T-rex has a female TRS port, much like the one in an iPod or iPhone, in its thigh (as all dinosaurs under the brand do on a part of their body), and is compatible with a male TRS plug on the barrel of the extractor gun. When you plug the two, a display will appear <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>screen</b> showing a DNA strand. This means that electronics in the dinosaur are sending signals through the gun, through the cable, and into your computer. When done, an online version of your dinosaur pops up onto your screen. From there, you can play online games with your dinosaur, and begin your Xtractaurs adventure.|$|E
5000|$|Digital {{visual art}} {{consists}} of either 2D visual information displayed on an electronic visual display or information mathematically translated into 3D information, viewed through perspective projection on an electronic visual display. The simplest is 2D computer graphics which reflect how you might draw using {{a pencil and}} a piece of paper. In this case, however, the image is on the computer screen and the instrument you draw with might be a tablet stylus or a mouse. What is generated <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>screen</b> might appear to be drawn with a pencil, pen or paintbrush. The second kind is 3D computer graphics, where the screen becomes a window into a virtual environment, where you arrange objects to be [...] "photographed" [...] by the computer. Typically a 2D computer graphics use raster graphics as their primary means of source data representations, whereas 3D computer graphics use vector graphics in the creation of immersive virtual reality installations. A possible third paradigm is to generate art in 2D or 3D entirely through the execution of algorithms coded into computer programs and could be considered the native art form of the computer. That is, it cannot be produced without the computer. Fractal art, Datamoshing, algorithmic art and real-time generative art are examples.|$|E

5000|$|According to Nowalk, {{the idea}} to have Lexie wear a diaper {{to get through the}} {{operation}} was inspired by an episode of The Oprah Winfrey Show. He added: [...] "It wasn't that big of a leap for us to go diaper. Our doctors are hardcore by nature." [...] Nowalk said that this episode was primarily focused around Shepherd, which he considered an [...] "experiment". He commented that the idea of Isaac's storyline came from Dr. Robert Bray, a neurosurgeon in Los Angeles. Nowalk intended the nature of the episode to be [...] "different", attributing it to the fact that Heigl's character was absent. He also praised Wilson for directing the episode, commenting that [...] "she acts, she sings, and now she directs". The majority of the episode involved Shepherd staring at his patient's tumor, contemplating what to do. Nowalk offered his insight on this: [...] "It's quieter than a typical episode. More single-minded. Derek is our sole focus. And really, what an amazing character to spend an entire episode with. Watch Patrick Dempsey <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>screen</b> and you can't help but be struck by how much he says without saying anything. The guy can pretty much give you an entire soliloquy with just one look. That's a rare talent, and we really wanted to use that to our advantage in an episode about stillness and peace."

5000|$|An {{interesting}} {{aspect to}} make the game increasingly difficult as you play a single game for a longer amount of time isthe inclusion of Whirley. Every minute or so during gameplay, a dinosaur will announce [...] "Whirley's coming!", and soonafter, Whirley (a purple pterodactyl) will fly across the screen carrying an egg of a color not yet <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>screen.</b> If Whirley is allowed to fly across the screen untouched, {{the color of his}} egg will be added to the pallet of colors in the egg mass, and the rate of the eggs' descent will reset to the default slow speed. However, if you shoot and hit Whirley, the color will not be added, but {{the rate at which the}} eggs descend will increase.Some eggs in egg mass will occasionally vibrate for a short period of time. If they are made to explode while still vibrating, a player soon receives a special egg for the slingshot that offers some form of bonus when shot and eventually forced to explode: the play area either narrows or widens to increase/decrease the speed of the dropping egg mass, the play area raises upward, the player receives a one time bonus of (50, 100, 200) points, an automatic score multiplier (2x, 3x or 4x) for 30 seconds, or the ability to see the full trajectory (including rebounds) of the egg to be shot for one minute.|$|E

I mean, 99 percent of the time, it gives the correct result - true if the subject is infected, and false if the subject is healthy. You give the test to a million people.One in a million people have Super-AIDS. One in a hundred people that you test will {{generate}} a [...] "false positive" [...] - the test will say he has Super-AIDS even though he doesn't. That's what [...] "99 percent accurate" [...] means: one percent wrong.What's one percent of one million?1,000,000/100 = 10,000One in a million people has Super-AIDS. If you test a million random people, you'll probably only find one case of real Super-AIDS. But your test won't identify one person as having Super-AIDS. It will identify 10,000 people as having it.Your 99 percent accurate test will perform with 99.99 percent inaccuracy.That's the paradox of the false positive. When you try to find something really rare, your test's accuracy has to match the rarity of the thing you're looking for. If you're trying to point at a single pixel <b>on</b> <b>your</b> <b>screen,</b> a sharp pencil is a good pointer: the pencil-tip is a lot smaller (more accurate) than the pixels. But a pencil-tip is no good at pointing at a single atom in your screen. For that, you need a pointer - a test - that's one atom wide or less at the tip.|$|E

50|$|In modern color theory, {{also known}} as the RGB color model, red, green and blue are {{additive}} primary colors. Red, green and blue light combined together makes white light, and these three colors, combined in different mixtures, can produce nearly any other color. This is the principle that is used to make all of the colors <b>on</b> <b>your</b> computer <b>screen</b> and <b>your</b> television. For example, purple on a computer screen is made by a similar formula to that used by Cennino Cennini in the Renaissance to make violet, but using additive colors and light instead of pigment: it is created by combining red and blue light at equal intensity on a black screen. Violet is made on a computer screen in a similar way, but with a greater amount of blue light and less red light.|$|R
