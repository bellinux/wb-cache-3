5|$|LARP {{has been}} a subject of {{academic}} research and theory. Much of this research originates from role-players, especially from the publications of the Nordic Knutepunkt role-playing conventions.

5|$|Linguistically, BASL {{differs from}} <b>other</b> <b>varieties</b> of ASL in its phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. BASL tends {{to have a}} larger signing space, meaning that some signs are {{produced}} further {{away from the body}} than in other dialects. Signers of BASL also tend to prefer two-handed variants of signs, while signers of ASL tend to prefer one-handed variants. Some signs are different in BASL as well, with some borrowings from African American English.|$|E

5|$|The bark of <b>other</b> <b>varieties</b> of oak has {{traditionally}} been used in Europe for the tanning of hides though bark from other species of tree has been used elsewhere. The active ingredient, tannin, is extracted and after various preliminary treatments, the skins are immersed {{in a series of}} vats containing solutions in increasing concentrations. The tannin causes the hide to become supple, less affected by water and more resistant to bacterial attack.|$|E
5|$|The first {{documented}} use of {{the term}} Primitivo appears in Italian governmental publications of the 1870s. The name derives from the terms primativus or primaticcio, which refer to the grape's tendency to ripen earlier than <b>other</b> <b>varieties.</b> This name's appearance, 40 years after the first documented {{use of the}} term Zinfandel, was previously thought to suggest that Primitivo was introduced to Italy from across the Atlantic; however, this hypothesis has become unlikely since the discovery of the vine's Croatian origin.|$|E
5|$|They are a {{hardy breed}} {{due to their}} native environment, the Highlands of Scotland. This results in long hair, giving the breed its ability to overwinter. Bulls can weigh up to 800kilograms (1,800 pounds) and cows up to 500kilograms (1,100 pounds). Their milk {{generally}} has a very high butterfat content, and their meat, regarded as of the highest quality, is gaining mainstream acceptance as it is lower in cholesterol than <b>other</b> <b>varieties</b> of beef.|$|E

5|$|Emerging in {{the mid-1980s}} with such bands as California's Saint Vitus, Maryland's The Obsessed, Chicago's Trouble, and Sweden's Candlemass, the doom metal {{movement}} rejected other metal styles' emphasis on speed, slowing its music to a crawl. Doom metal traces its roots to the lyrical themes and musical approach of early Black Sabbath. The Melvins have also been a significant influence on doom metal {{and a number of}} its subgenres. Doom emphasizes melody, melancholy tempos, and a sepulchral mood relative to many <b>other</b> <b>varieties</b> of metal.|$|E
5|$|Leopoldii hybrids {{arose from}} the work of the British {{explorer}} and botanist Richard Pearce, an employee of James Veitch & Sons, a plant nursery. Pearce brought back specimens of Hippeastrum leopoldii and Hippeastrum pardinum from the Andes. These two species were notable for large flowers that were wide open and relatively symmetrical. Crossing these two species with the best of the Reginae strain produced a lineage of very large open flowered specimens, with up to 4-6 flowers on each scape. The Veitch nursery dominated the commercial development of Hippeastrum leopoldii and <b>other</b> <b>varieties</b> up to {{the early years of the}} twentieth century, the best of their hybrids setting the standard for modern commercial development.|$|E
5|$|Many {{users of}} English in the {{expanding}} circle {{use it to}} communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use English. Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of <b>other</b> <b>varieties.</b> Very often today a conversation in English {{anywhere in the world}} may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries.|$|E

5|$|One of the {{earliest}} innovations of UPLB was the production of CAC 87 sugar cane in 1919. This high-yielding variety is resistant to fiji and mosaic viruses, and produces more sucrose than <b>other</b> <b>varieties.</b> Its derivatives significantly increased sugar cane production in the Philippines. Between 1921 and 1939, cattle, poultry, and swine breeding programs produced new breeds, namely the Philamin (a hybrid of the Hereford, Nellore and native cattle), Berkjala (a variety of the Berkshire and local Jala-Jala pig, resistant to hog cholera) and the Los Baños Cantonese chicken, which produces more eggs.|$|E
5|$|Variations {{are also}} found with the {{spelling}} of unit names in countries using the same language, including differences in American English and British spelling. For example, meter and liter {{are used in the}} United States whereas metre and litre are used in other English-speaking countries. In addition, the official US spelling for the rarely used SI prefix for ten is deka. In American English the term metric ton is the normal usage whereas in <b>other</b> <b>varieties</b> of English tonne is common. Gram is also sometimes spelled gramme in English-speaking countries other than the United States, though this older usage is declining.|$|E
5|$|B.spinulosa var.spinulosa: The {{nominate}} race is an autonym, a {{name that}} was automatically created for the original material of the species as the other subspecies were described. The original hairpin banksia, this plant is coastal in Queensland, seen in such places as Walshs Pyramid (near Cairns), Byfield National Park and the Blackdown Tableland, then again in New South Wales south of the Hawkesbury River, just north of Sydney, down the New South Wales South Coast and into Victoria. Northwards of the Hawkesbury River on Sydney's northern outskirts there is a gradation between this and B.spinulosa var.collina. It commonly has black, maroon or claret styles on gold spikes but all-gold inflorescences are seen, and leaves are generally narrower than <b>other</b> <b>varieties</b> at 1–2mm in width and have several serrations toward the apex only.|$|E
