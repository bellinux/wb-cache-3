5|$|One {{of these}} aspects which fascinated Balzac was the life <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> <b>In</b> {{the winter of}} 1828–29, a French grifter-turned-policeman named Eugène François Vidocq {{published}} a pair of sensationalized memoirs recounting his criminal exploits. Balzac met Vidocq in April 1834, and used him {{as a model for}} a character named Vautrin he was planning for an upcoming novel.|$|E

During 2011, there were 656 vehicle crimes, 915 robberies, 2,597 violent crimes and 5,039 reported instances of anti-social behaviour.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet-style {{secret police}} and the central {{security}} office Urząd Bezpieczeństwa (UB) grew to around 32,000 agents as of 1953. At its Stalinist peak, there was one UB agent for every 800 Polish citizens. The MBP was also {{in charge of the}} Internal Security Corps, the Civil Militia (MO), border guard, prison staff and paramilitary police ORMO used for special actions (with over 100,000 members). The ORMO originated from popular self-defense efforts, a spontaneous reaction to the explosion <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> the power vacuum of 1944–45. In February 1946 the PPR channeled and formalized this citizen militia movement, creating its ostensibly crime control voluntary ORMO structure.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the losses}} of {{industry}} and jobs, St. Louis has had significant and persistent problems with both crime and perceptions <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> <b>In</b> 2011 St. Louis was named by U.S. News and World Report as the most dangerous city in the United States, using Uniform Crime Reports data published by the U.S. Department of Justice. In addition, St. Louis was named as the city with the highest crime rate in the United States by CQ Press in 2010, using data reported to the FBI in 2009. Critics of these analyses note that division between St. Louis City and St. Louis County make crime reports for the area appear inflated, and that reporting crime differs greatly depending on the localities involved. The FBI cautioned against using this data {{as a form of}} ranking, as it presents too simplistic a view of crime. From 2006 to 2007, the rate of city youth to be killed by guns was the second-highest in the United States, according to data released by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The rate of firearm deaths for the metropolitan statistical area was one-fifth of the city rate.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that illegal immigration increases the rate <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> the United States.

Research suggests that immigration enforcement has no impact on crime rates.|$|E
25|$|Although Bunker was {{eventually}} released, he continued a life <b>of</b> <b>crime.</b> <b>In</b> the early 1970s, Bunker ran a profitable drug racket in San Francisco; {{he was arrested}} again when the police, who had put a tracking device on his car, followed him to a bank heist.

25|$|In November 1993, Allen {{was elected}} the 67th Governor of Virginia, serving from 1994 to 1998.

More importantly, he was running {{at the start of}} what would become the 1994 Republican Revolution. Allen overcame the deficit and won with 58.3% of the vote, the largest margin (+17.4 points) since Albertis S. Harrison Jr. defeated H. Clyde Pearson with a margin of +27.7 points in 1961.|$|E
25|$|Being Sicily's {{administrative}} capital, Palermo is a centre {{for much}} of the region's finance, tourism and commerce. The city currently hosts an international airport, and Palermo's economic growth over the years has brought the opening of many new businesses. The economy mainly relies on tourism and services, but also has commerce, shipbuilding and agriculture. The city, however, still has high unemployment levels, high corruption and a significant black market empire (Palermo being the home of the Sicilian Mafia). Even though the city still suffers from widespread corruption, inefficient bureaucracy and organized crime, the level <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> Palermo has gone down dramatically, unemployment has been decreasing and many new, profitable opportunities for growth (especially regarding tourism) have been introduced, making the city safer and better to live in.|$|E
25|$|ValeWatch {{also allowed}} the HAT {{to tackle the}} source <b>of</b> <b>crime</b> <b>in</b> the estate and, in 1998, evicted the ringleaders of the Green Box Gang, which was small, notorious gang {{consisting}} mainly of teenage troublemakers. These were the first evictees from the estate. In Autumn 2000, CVHAT sought the eviction of five families who were accused of persistently breaking their tenancy conditions. This {{was considered to be}} a landmark case as it used a multi-trial approach where all five families could be tried at once, saving the HAT time and money. A further 20 families were given Notices of Seeking Possession during 2000, and the HAT collated evidence and built cases against the families. During this time, some of the families improved their behaviour whilst others left the estate. Those that were taken to court saw cases that involved 112 witness statements, supported by covert surveillance footage in some instances.|$|E
