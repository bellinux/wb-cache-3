40|$|Graphene, a 2 D allotrope of carbon, has, {{since its}} {{synthesis}} in 2004, taken {{the world of}} physicists by storm. By virtue of its unique energy spectrum grapheme exhibit many unique electronic properties - ultra high mobility of charge carriers and ambipolar effect {{are two of the}} most important ones. Three terminal ballistic junctions (TBJ), a new class of device, which has in past showed a host of novel non-linear electrical properties when fabricated out of semiconductor hetero structure, can be used to form active devices out of graphene that contravene the latter's gapless nature. In this thesis three terminal junctions were fabricated on both mono- and bilayer graphene. When operated in a push-pull configuration at room temperature both of them displayed near parabolic voltage and current output. Due to the ambipolar effect of graphene the nature of the <b>output</b> <b>curves</b> could be tuned with a back gate voltage. It was observed that the <b>output</b> <b>curves</b> tend to bend upward for operation in the electron transport regime and downward in the hole transport regime. Moreover, the <b>output</b> <b>curves</b> became progressively more non-linear as the back gate voltage drove the system deeper into either of these regimes. Both of these observations were in direct opposition to the data published in earlier literatures. The voltage rectification of the devices was found out to be about 5 %. With clearer theoretical understanding of the mechanism and better fabrication strategies it is hoped that three terminal graphene junctions {{can be used to make}} rectifiers, frequency multipliers and logic gates capable of performing at high speed and low power...|$|R

40|$|Presented {{here is an}} {{analysis}} {{of some of the}} existing methods used for the determination of the series resistance of solar cells {{which is one of the}} key parameters in solar cell fabrication and technology together with the diode ideality factor and the reverse saturation current. These methods are based on the network analysis of the single-exponential lumped constant parameters model which has been accepted as being operationally sufficient to describe the current-voltage characteristics of the solar cell. The methods analyzed in this study are divided into two main groups. Methods using two I-V characteristics and methods using a single I-V <b>output</b> <b>curve.</b> For comparison purposes, all methods are applied first using data extracted from existing I-V curves and then using in-lab measurements of a commercial solar cell. It is demonstrated that the determination of the series resistance of solar cells using two I-V characteristics has several advantages over methods using a single I-V <b>output</b> <b>curve.</b> It becomes evident that methods which use a single I-V <b>output</b> <b>curve</b> are only accurate for cells operating under very high illumination conditions. At normal intensities, however, such methods result in erroneous R(s) values. This is due to the assumption of a constant diode ideality factor along the entire I-V <b>output</b> <b>curve</b> used in the derivation of these methods. It is shown that this assumption is inaccurate at normal intensity levels and can be appropriate only under very high illuminations. Three new methods are proposed in this study. One of the methods presents a new approach in determining the solar cell equation parameters. The new approach relies upon treating the diode ideality factor of the solar cell as a variable that is a function of both the terminal current and the light intensity level. The method uses two I-V output curves at different illumination levels in determining all solar cell parameters: The series resistance, the diode ideality factor and the reverse saturation current. Although somehow tedious, the new approach shows that, for accurate modeling of solar cells and prediction of illuminated characteristics at different light levels based on the single-exponential model, the diode ideality factor should be treated as a variable while the series resistance is held constant. Comparison between all methods is presented and a reasonable judgement and recommendations concerning the best method to be used are given...|$|E

The oscillation system of continuous casting mold driven by servo motor is a complicated nonlinear system. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} establish an accurate model for the system before performing simulation experiments. Based on the oscillation platform system of continuous casting mold driven by servo motor in the laboratory, the nonlinear models of servo motor speed system and mechanical transmission parts were respectively established and the viscous friction coefficient, moment of inertia, and load torque were identified. Then, the nonlinear mathematical model of the whole oscillation platform of continuous casting mold driven by servo motor was obtained. The comparison results between the simulated <b>output</b> <b>curves</b> of established model and the measured <b>output</b> <b>curves</b> of actual system under the same input signals indicated that the simulated curves were almost in accord with the measured curves.

40|$|Effects of {{techniques}} of implanting nitrogen into buried oxide {{on the characteristics}} of the partially depleted silicon-on-insulator (SOI) p-channel metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (PMOSFETs) have been studied with three different nitrogen implantation doses, 8 x 10 (15), 2 x 10 (16), and 1 x 10 (17) cm(- 2). The experimental results show that this technology can affect the threshold voltage, channel hole mobility and output characteristics of the partially depleted SOI PMOSFETs fabricated with the given material and process. For each type of the partially depleted SOI PMOSFET with nitrided buried oxide, the absolute value of the average threshold voltage increases due to the nitrogen implantation. At the same time, the average channel hole mobility decreases because of the nitrogen implantation. In particular, with the high nitrogen implantation doses, the <b>output</b> characteristic <b>curves</b> of the tested transistors present a distinct kink effect, which normally exists in the characteristic <b>output</b> <b>curves</b> of only partially depleted SOI NMOSFETs...|$|R
