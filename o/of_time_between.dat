5|$|In {{terms of}} rhythm, English is {{generally}} {{described as a}} stress-timed language, meaning that the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> stressed syllables tends to be equal. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in vowel quality: vowel reduction.|$|E
5|$|Secondary {{progressive}} MS {{occurs in}} around 65% {{of those with}} initial relapsing-remitting MS, who eventually have progressive neurologic decline between acute attacks without any definite periods of remission. Occasional relapses and minor remissions may appear. The most common length <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> disease onset and conversion from relapsing-remitting to secondary progressive MS is 19years.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the length}} of closure is defined in terms <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> {{the closure of the}} vocal tract after the {{preceding}} vowel, and the release before the following vowel, stops at the beginning or end of a word do not have a fortis-lenis contrast. Orthographically in Wagiman, word-initial stops are written using the voiced Roman letters (b, d and g), {{but at the end of}} a word, voiceless letters (p, t and k) are used instead.|$|E

5|$|The 2003 NPB season saw {{the most}} cycles hit {{in a single}} season—five. That season also saw the only {{instance}} of cycles occurring on the same day: on July 1, hit by Atsunori Inaba of the Yakult Swallows and Arihito Muramatsu of the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. The next day, Shinjiro Hiyama became the third player to hit for the cycle in two days. Conversely, the longest period <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> two players hitting for the cycle was 3years, 5months, and 9days, a drought lasting from Alex Ochoa cycle in 2004 to Julio Zuleta in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Wisden Trophy {{is awarded}} to {{the winner of the}} Test cricket series played between England and the West Indies.

5|$|The {{first period}} usually begins between twelve and {{fifteen years of}} age, {{a point in time}} known as menarche. They may {{occasionally}} start as early as eight, and this onset may still be normal. The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world and earlier in developed world. The typical length <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> the first day of one period and {{the first day of the}} next is 21 to 45 days in young women and 21 to 35 days in adults (an average of 28 days).|$|E

5|$|Advances {{of funds}} – Advances are federal funds {{provided}} to a recipient {{before the program}} activity is performed. Recipients determine the amount needed for a future expenditure (e.g., through budget process) and request the amount {{to the federal government}} (or in the case of subrecipients to the pass-through entity, see Subrecipient Monitoring below). The federal funds received are then expended to perform the specific activity (e.g., purchase good or service or for payroll). However, laws and regulations require recipients to request funds only when it is immediately needed, and recipients must try to minimize the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> the receipts of funds to the actual disbursement. Examples of programs under these funding techniques are the Section 8 program and the Community Development Block Grant program.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, RAF Bomber Command and the U.S. Strategic Air Command cooperated in the Single Integrated Operational Plan (SIOP) {{to ensure}} {{coverage}} of all major Soviet targets from 1958, 108 aircraft of the RAF's V-Bombers were assigned targets under SIOP {{by the end}} of 1959. From 1962 onwards, two jets in every major RAF base were armed with nuclear weapons and on standby permanently under the principle of Quick Reaction Alert (QRA). Vulcans on QRA standby were to be airborne within four minutes of receiving an alert, as this was identified as the amount <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> warning of a USSR nuclear strike being launched and it arriving in Britain. The closest the Vulcan came to taking part in potential nuclear conflict was during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, where Bomber Command was moved to Alert Condition 3, an increased state of preparedness from normal operations; however, it stood down in early November.|$|E
5|$|The B-70, {{designed}} for even higher speeds, altitudes and range than the B-58, suffered {{even more in}} relative terms. At high altitudes, the B-70 was as much as four {{times as fast as}} the B-52, but at low altitudes it was limited to only Mach0.95, only modestly faster than the B-52 at the same altitudes. It also had a smaller bombload and shorter range. Its only major advantage would be its ability to use high speed in areas without missile cover, especially on the long journey from the USA to USSR. The value was limited; the USAF's doctrine stressed that the primary reason for maintaining the bomber force in an era of ICBMs was that the bombers could remain in the air at long ranges from their bases and were thus immune to sneak attack. In this case, the higher speed would be used for only a short period <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> the staging areas and the Soviet coastline.|$|E

5|$|The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) {{selected}} Guangzhou to {{host the}} 2010 Games at their 23rd general assembly session in Doha, Qatar, site of the 2006 Asian Games, on July 1, 2004. Seoul and Amman dropped out before their bids were officially selected by the OCA, leaving only two candidate cities— Guangzhou and Kuala Lumpur. Seoul withdrew after considering the short span <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> 2002 and 2010, as South Korea hosted the 2002 Games in Busan. Evaluation committee of the OCA, headed by the then vice-president of the association Celso Dayrit inspected both the final bidders. Kuala Lumpur was forced to withdraw its bid after the declaration of the Malaysian Government on April 15, 2004 that it wouldn't support the Olympic Council of Malaysia with a Kuala Lumpur bid, due to {{the high cost of}} hosting the Games, leaving Guangzhou as the sole bidder.|$|E
5|$|The most cycles hit in {{a single}} major league season is eight. Cycles have {{occurred}} {{on the same day}} twice in Major League Baseball history: on September 17, 1920, hit by Bobby Veach of the Detroit Tigers and George Burns of the New York Giants; and again on September 1, 2008, when the Arizona Diamondbacks' Stephen Drew and the Seattle Mariners' Adrián Beltré each completed the four-hit group. Conversely, the longest period <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> two players hitting for the cycle was 5 years, 1 month, and 10 days, a drought lasting from Bill Joyce cycle in 1896 to Harry Davis in 1901.|$|E
5|$|The period <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> {{an injury}} and {{development}} of epilepsy varies, {{and it is not}} uncommon for an injury to be followed by a latent period with no recurrent seizures. The longer a person goes without developing seizures, the lower the chances are that epilepsy will develop. At least 80–90% of people with PTE have their first seizure within two years of the TBI. People with no seizures within three years of the injury have only a 5% chance of developing epilepsy. However, one study found that head trauma survivors are at an increased risk for PTE as many as 10years after moderate TBI and over 20years after severe TBI. Since head trauma is fairly common and epilepsy can occur late after the injury, it can be difficult to determine whether a case of epilepsy resulted from head trauma in the past or whether the trauma was incidental.|$|E

5|$|The most cycles hit by {{a player}} in Nippon Professional Baseball is three, {{accomplished}} by Bobby Rose. Playing for the Yokohama BayStars, Rose hit his first cycle on May 2, 1995, the next on April 29, 1997, and his final cycle on June 30, 1999. Other than Rose, only three other NPB players have hit multiple cycles: Fumio Fujimura with the Osaka Tigers and Hiromi Matsunaga with the Hankyu/Orix Braves and Kosuke Fukudome with the Chunichi Dragons and the Hanshin Tigers, all with two. Fujimura is also the only player to have hit a cycle during both the single league era and the current dual league era. The 2003 NPB season saw the most cycles hit in a single season—five. That season also saw the only instance of cycles occurring in two different games on the same day: on July 1, hit by Atsunori Inaba of the Yakult Swallows and Arihito Muramatsu of the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks. The next day, Shinjiro Hiyama became the third player to hit for the cycle in two days. Conversely, the longest period <b>of</b> <b>time</b> <b>between</b> two players hitting for the cycle is one day shy of 6years. The drought has lasted from Michihiro Ogasawara's cycle in 2008 until Rainel Rosario's in 2014.|$|E
