40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} harvesting time and husk on the proximate composition of boiled orange maize hybrids. Eight fresh orange maize hybrids were boiled with and without intact husk at 100 oC using atmospheric cooking method and evaluated for proximate components. The results of analysis of variance [ANOVA] revealed that maturity [harvesting time] and method had significant effects [p ≤ 0. 001] on all proximate components. There was a general decrease in dry matter [DM], ash and total sugar contents across harvest maturity stages. Protein and fat increased at 20 DAP and 27 DAP and then decreased at 34 DAP. The unprocessed maize had optimum sugar content at 20 DAP and optimum protein and fat contents at 27 DAP. The optimum sugar and protein contents were found at 20 DAP and 34 DAP respectively for boiled maize without husk, while optimum sugar and protein contents were found at 20 DAP for boiled maize <b>with</b> <b>husk.</b> Boiled maize <b>with</b> <b>husk</b> had higher retention of protein, total sugars and starch at 20 DAP than boiled maize without husk.

Similarly cob yield (<b>with</b> <b>husk),</b> green fodder/stover yield, harvest index, kernel yield of popcorn and shelling percentage of popcorn were found significantly higher at 120 kg N ha- 1 {{than the other two}} lower doses of nitrogen. The different types of corn were found significantly different from each other regarding growth parameters such as plant height, days to 50 per cent silking and days to maturity.

40|$|Winter oats {{were grown}} {{according}} to European organic farming regulations in monoculture (oats) and in intercropping with bard vetch (BAV), bitter vetch (BIV) or both legumes (MIX) {{to evaluate the}} effects of intercropping on forage yield and nutritive value for ruminants. The experiment was carried out as a {{randomised complete block design}} with four replications, and whole forage samples were obtained at two harvest dates (June and July). For both harvest times, all intercrops increased (P < 0. 05) forage yield compared <b>with</b> <b>oats,</b> but forage crude protein content was only increased (P < 0. 05) for BAV and MIX. Compared <b>with</b> <b>oats,</b> intercropping <b>with</b> BAV increased (P < 0. 05) in vitro rate of gas production and total volatile fatty acid production, indicating a higher rate and extent of rumen degradation of BAV forage. In contrast, BIV forage harvested in June had lower (P < 0. 05) rate of gas production and total volatile fatty acid production than June oats, but in general no differences in the in vitro rumen fermentation were detected between oats and BIV samples harvested in July. The results indicate that forage yield and quality can be enhanced by intercropping <b>oats</b> <b>with</b> BAV; however, intercropping with BIV increased yield but decreased nutritive value of the forage. © CSIRO 2014.

40|$|ABSTRACT The goal of {{the study}} was to test the effects of {{combined}} weeding and gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium) intercropping for weed control in baby corn and green corn production. A completely randomized block design was employed, with split-plot and four replicates. Hybrids AG 1051 and BR 205 were subjected to the following treatments: A = two hoeings, 20 and 40 days after sowing (DAS); B = hoeing at 20 DAS + gliricidia intercropping following weeding; C = gliricidia intercropping established at the moment of corn sowing (GICS) + hoeing at 40 DAS; D = GICS; E = no weeding. Gliricidia was broadcast sown with 30 viable seeds m- 2. The best treatments follow the order A > B > C as number of ears, fresh mass of ears <b>with</b> <b>husks,</b> fresh and dry masses of ears without husks for baby corn, and number of ears, fresh mass of ears <b>with</b> <b>husks,</b> fresh and dry masses of ears without husks for green corn. The worst results are observed for treatments D and E. Treatment D is only better than treatment E for the number of marketable ears without husks.
