30|$|In the {{presence}} <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> VI (Nos. 3 and 4), the degradation <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> I and production <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> II {{in the early}} stage were clearly observed in the oxygen-alkali treatments <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> I.

Since the aromatic A-ring <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> I {{is considered to be}} fairly resistant toward oxidation by both dioxygen and AOS, as mentioned above [4, 6, 8], the liberation <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> II from compound I should result from the attack of AOS on the side chain (see Fig.  3 for the definition of side chain) <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> I.|$|R

Although the amount of the generator <b>of</b> AOS, <b>compound</b> VI, added in the treatment No. 4 was as 10 times as that in the treatment No. 3, the difference in the degradations <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> I between these treatments was not significantly great.

30|$|Because the {{aromatic}} A-ring <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> IV {{is fairly}} stable under the conditions employed {{in this study}} [4, 6, 8], as mentioned above, the observation of the liberation <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> V should strongly suggest that AOS can attack the side chain <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> IV resulting in the liberation <b>of</b> <b>compound</b> V. Therefore, this type of attack of AOS can be evaluated using compound IV. Compound IV can be dissolved in the alkaline water solution probably owing {{to the presence of}} two fluorines in its B-ring.|$|R

However, the United States Department of Agriculture withdrew these ratings in 2012 as biologically invalid, stating that no physiological proof in vivo existed to support the free-radical theory or roles for ingested phytochemicals, especially for polyphenols. Consequently, the ORAC method, derived only from in vitro experiments, is no longer considered relevant to human diets or biology.|$|E
