5|$|Female-female {{aggression}}, {{which is}} fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps. First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other’s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> immediate vicinity. Escalation {{is determined by}} several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact {{is much more likely}} to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.|$|E

25|$|A {{relatively}} small, but notable {{difference in}} the show format from its French counterpart is the selection process. Each week, the French version asks the public and judging panel to vote for which <b>one,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contenders in danger, should be excluded from the show. The results are announced live, on stage, to the excluded member and the viewers. While this formula was followed in the beginning for Star Académie, it soon was changed because of protests, for the system was seen as cruel treatment to the excluded participant. On one early show, singer Daniel Boucher quit the studio halfway through the show because of this impression. Consequently, the public and judges are now asked {{to vote for the}} participant to remain at the Académie. In all seasons, the results are announced live.|$|E

500|$|National {{media outlet}} reviewers were {{generally}} negative. Frederic Smith of Commonweal opined, [...] " [...] interesting only in measure of its complete failure".

In Vanity Fairs [...] "Worst Movie of 1932" [...] article, Pare Lorentz wrote about a [...] "terrific deadlock with Blonde Venus holding a slight lead over White Zombie, Bring 'Em Back Alive, and Murders in the Rue Morgue". In the United Kingdom, press was mixed. The Kinematograph Weekly thought the film was [...] "quite well acted, and has good atmosphere" [...] but thought, too, it was [...] "not for the squeamish or the highly intelligent". The Cinema News and Property Gazette thought the film was for the [...] "less sophisticated" [...] and that the [...] "exaggerated treatment of the subject achieves reverse effect to thrill or conviction". Years after the film's release, Victor Halperin expressed a distaste for his horror films: [...] "I don't believe in fear, violence, and horror, so why traffic in them?" ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V.

The episode curdles a bit while looking for a sweet ending, but it is otherwise solid enough." [...] Critics have praised the opening sequence that parodies Game of Thrones. Tim Surette of TV.com called it [...] "one minute of genius", and MTV's Brandon Freeberg wrote: [...] "Congratulations are in order for Matt Groening and his staff for really knocking this <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park." [...] Jenna Busch of Zap2it and Kelly West of Cinema Blend, both fans of Game of Thrones, named the opening {{the best in the}} history of the show. IGN's Eric Goldman commented: [...] "Ah, The Simpsons. Always there for us with clever/loving parody of something we all love.

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series.

[...] He gave the episode a score of two out of ten, remarking that [...] "it's rarely a good idea to do an episode where everyone acts out of character as only the second <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gate, since we don't know enough about these people for their acting strange to be meaningful." [...] Cast member Wil Wheaton re-watched the episode for AOL TV, and summed it up saying [...] "whether it was the worst episode ever or not probably rested upon the viewer's expectations. Trekkies who were looking for reasons to hate The Next Generation found plenty" [...] while [...] "viewers who were willing to watch it with an open mind saw flashes of things they came to love watching," [...] and gave it a score of D+.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Ron and Tammys" [...] Tammy 1 assumes {{control of}} Ron, turning {{him into a}} mustache-less pushover {{in an effort to}} remarry him and take all his hidden gold. [...] This is quite the {{difference}} compared to the influence Ron's latest ex (Tammy 2) has over him. [...] While Tammy 1 has an ice cold personality and reduces Ron into submissiveness and quietude, Tammy 2 causes Ron to make highly irrational decisions that end up jeopardizing his position at the Parks office. [...] Tammy 2 also tries to assume control of Ron through using manipulation of her body. [...] Ron is saved from the grasp of Tammy 1 after his own mother, who is also ironically a Tammy- her name is Tamara (he refers to her as Tammy 0) to restore her son. [...] He snaps back to his old self after witnessing a drinking contest between Tammy 1 and Tammy 0. [...] They then drink in order to win control over Ron. Leslie also enters this competition in hopes of freeing him of the Tammys, however she ends up failing miserably due to the high alcohol content of Swanson family mash and is the first <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contest.

500|$|On {{its initial}} broadcast, the episode was watched by 2.998 million viewers. It {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics, with TV Guide ranking the episode No. 95 in its 2009 list of [...] "TV's Top 100 Episodes of All Time". BuddyTV's Don Williams deemed the finale [...] "absolutely fantastic", and ranked it tenth {{on his list}} of the top Supernatural episodes {{of the first three}} seasons. Although he [...] "respected the show for having the guts to follow through with [...] deal"—the ending was a [...] "complete jaw-dropper"—he pointed out the previous times the Winchesters have died and were subsequently resurrected. Memorable moments for Williams include Sam and Dean singing [...] "Wanted Dead or Alive", and Dean admitting that his love for Sam is his main weakness. Likewise, TV Guides Tina Charles described the episode as [...] "creepy and suspenseful and funny and sad and just plain awesome", and felt it came close to outdoing the first-season finale [...] "Devil's Trap". Especially praised were the actors' performances. Padalecki [...] "totally {{stepped up to the plate}} and knocked <b>one</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> park", and Ackles was [...] "nine kinds of awesome". On the latter, Charles noted, [...] "From acting out Dean's stubborn ways, his inappropriate humor, those crushing looks of despair and doom and Dean's death, the man can play it all." [...] McCormick was described as [...] "creepy", leading to Charles' [...] "huge compliment" [...] of comparing the episode to The Twilight Zone. For the critic, the [...] "totally unexpected" [...] Bon Jovi sing-along [...] "totally rocked" [...] and has [...] "instantly become a classic". Her main disappointment with the episode, however, was the lack of Sam [...] "going dark side". Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune listed the episode as one of the [...] "gems" [...] of the third season, and believed it likely to end up as one of her [...] "Favorite 'Supernatural' Episodes of All Time". The San Diego Union-Tribunes Karla Peterson agreed, giving the episode a grade of A-. Although it [...] "got off to a shaky start with some weirdly paced scenes", it ended up a [...] "finale that wrapped us in sticky threads of old fears, mind-bending new business and one awesome Bon Jovi song".|$|E
