5|$|The pygmy {{right whale}} shares several {{characteristics}} with the right whales, although having dorsal fins separates them from right whales, {{and they have a}} very distinctive jaw configuration. Pygmy right whales' heads are no more than one-fourth the size of their bodies, whereas the right whales' heads are about <b>one-third</b> <b>the</b> size of their bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{sperm whale}} {{characteristically}} has a large, squarish head <b>one-third</b> <b>the</b> length of its body; the blowhole is {{slightly to the}} left hand side; the skin is usually wrinkled; and it has no teeth on the upper jaw.|$|E
5|$|With the {{presence}} of various orbiters, landers, and rovers, {{it is possible to}} practice astronomy from Mars.

5|$|Extant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta, {{where the}} {{maternal}} blood {{does not come}} {{in direct contact with}} the fetal chorion like it does in the hemochorial placenta of haplorhines. The strepsirrhine uterus has two distinct chambers (bicornuate). Despite having similar gestation periods to comparably sized haplorhines, fetal growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring that are as little as <b>one-third</b> <b>the</b> size of haplorhine newborns. Extant strepsirrhines also have a lower basal metabolic rate, which elevates in females during gestation, putting greater demands on the mother.|$|E
5|$|Metformin {{decreases}} {{high blood}} sugar, primarily by suppressing liver glucose production (hepatic gluconeogenesis). The average patient with {{type 2 diabetes}} has three times the normal rate of gluconeogenesis; metformin treatment reduces this by over <b>one-third.</b> <b>The</b> molecular mechanism of metformin is incompletely understood. Multiple potential mechanisms of action have been proposed, including; inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of glucagon-induced elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with reduced activation of protein kinase A (PKA), inhibition of mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase, and an effect on gut microbiota.|$|E
5|$|State legislatures elect {{members for}} terms of five years. States with {{bicameral}} legislatures have an upper house (Legislative Council) with members {{not more than}} <b>one-third</b> <b>the</b> size of the Assembly. Governors may suspend or dissolve assemblies and can administer when no party is able to form a government. Each state is organised {{into a number of}} districts, which are further subdivided into revenue divisions and taluks (or tehsils) for administration. Local bodies govern respective cities, towns and villages with each electing a mayor, municipal chairman and panchayat chairman respectively to head the same.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 20 mm. The forewings are fuscous {{with a broad}} ochreous-whitish the costal streak from the base nearly to the apex, narrowing posteriorly, with a small angular projection on the lower edge at <b>one-thirds.</b> <b>The</b> hindwings are grey-whitish.|$|R

The forearm {{was defined as the}} middle forearm, and the elbow was defined as extending from <b>the</b> proximal <b>one-third</b> of <b>the</b> forearm to <b>the</b> distal <b>one-third</b> of <b>the</b> upper arm.

5|$|Young {{proposed}} {{the plan in}} a letter to Franklin D. Richards, President of the European Mission, in September 1855. His letter was published in the Millennial Star, the Church's England-based periodical, on December 22, 1855, along with an editorial by Richards endorsing the project. The cost of the migration was expected to be reduced by <b>one-third.</b> <b>The</b> response was overwhelming – in 1856 the Perpetual Emigration Fund supported the travel of 2,012 European emigrants, compared with 1,161 the year before.|$|E
5|$|At the back, the nasals are {{separated}} by the frontal in K. langenbergensis, the back third of which is somewhat vaulted. The portion of the frontal between the eyes is <b>one-third</b> <b>the</b> width of the entire skull in both species, but it widens further back to form {{the front of the}} skull roof. The prefrontal is straight along its contact with the frontal and nasal (about half of the bone is in contact with each), but forms an angle between the margin of the eye socket and the lacrimal on the other side. This angle is rounded in K. guimarotae such that the bone is oval-shaped, but very pointed in K. langenbergensis such that the bone is triangular.|$|E
5|$|NuScale {{was founded}} based on {{research}} funded by the US Department of Energy and conducted by Oregon State University, the Idaho National Laboratory, and other colleges beginning in 2000. At the time, Oregon State's nuclear department had been developing passive water-circulation techniques for cooling in nuclear plants. The research grant ended in 2003, but {{a group of scientists}} at Oregon State University continued the work. They built a test lab at <b>one-third</b> <b>the</b> actual scale of the technology and inherited related patents from the university in 2007, in exchange for a small equity in the company. NuScale was founded that same year. Its first funding round was in January 2008 for an undisclosed sum. It began seeking certification with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission in February 2008.|$|E

5|$|Salanoia durrelli has a {{more robust}} {{dentition}} than the brown-tailed mongoose; the teeth have larger surface areas. The first and second upper incisors are smaller than the third, which is separated by a pronounced diastema (gap) from the canine tooth. The canine is more robust than in the brown-tailed mongoose. The first upper premolar is small, but {{the second and third}} are larger; these two teeth are shorter and broader than in the brown-tailed mongoose. The fourth premolar is large, as is the first molar. The second upper molar is less than <b>one-third</b> <b>the</b> size of the first, and is more highly reduced than that of the brown-tailed mongoose, which is about two-thirds the size of the first molar. The first lower incisor is smaller than the other two. The lower canine, premolars, and first molar are well-developed. The second molar is broad, but smaller than in the brown-tailed mongoose.|$|E
5|$|Vision {{seems to}} be more {{important}} to the pelagic ray in finding food than in other stingrays. Compared to other members of its family, this species has less than <b>one-third</b> <b>the</b> density of electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini on its underside. The ampullae also cover a smaller area, though not as small as in eagle rays, and are more evenly distributed between the ventral and dorsal surfaces. This ray can detect an electric field of well under 1 nV/cm at a distance of up to , and may be able to pick up the minute electric fields produced by moving sea water. The lateral line of the pelagic stingray, a complex system of mechanoreceptors that detect nearby movement and ocean currents, remains similar to other stingrays in covering a greater area on the ventral than the dorsal surface. However, this species is less responsive to mechanical than to visual stimuli.|$|E
