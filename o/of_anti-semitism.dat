5|$|The poem's {{narrative}} {{echoes the}} text of the Nunc dimittis, a liturgical prayer for Compline derived from the Gospel passage. Eliot introduces literary allusions to earlier writers Lancelot Andrewes, Dante Alighieri and St. John of the Cross. Several critics have debated whether Eliot's depiction of Simeon is a negative portrayal of a Jewish figure and evidence <b>of</b> <b>anti-Semitism</b> on Eliot's part.|$|E
5|$|Cutthroat {{competition}} {{was nothing to}} what was to follow. The 1890s were a tough time for the Romanian economy, and a rising tide <b>of</b> <b>anti-Semitism</b> made it an even tougher time for the Jews. One quarter of the Jewish population emigrated, with intellectuals particularly likely to leave, and those intellectuals who remained {{were more interested in}} politics than in theater: this was a period of social ferment, with Jewish socialists in Iaşi starting Der Veker (The Awakener).|$|E
5|$|That year saw Shostakovich again turn to {{the subject}} <b>of</b> <b>anti-Semitism</b> in his Thirteenth Symphony (subtitled Babi Yar). The symphony sets a number of poems by Yevgeny Yevtushenko, {{the first of which}} commemorates a {{massacre}} of Ukrainian Jews during the Second World War. Opinions are divided how great a risk this was: the poem had been published in Soviet media, and was not banned, but it remained controversial. After the symphony's premiere, Yevtushenko was forced to add a stanza to his poem which said that Russians and Ukrainians had died alongside the Jews at Babi Yar.|$|E

5|$|The ADL's National Director Abraham H. Foxman {{has accused}} him <b>of</b> <b>anti-Semitism</b> as has Rabbi Abraham Cooper, {{associate}} dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center. Waters stated that Cooper's accusation was bigoted. On 2 October 2015, Waters published an open letter in Salon criticising the band Bon Jovi for performing in Tel Aviv, which led Howard Stern to criticise Waters on his radio show. In June 2017 an organization known as We Don't Need No Roger Waters started to boycott Waters for his support of the BDS.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} college in her teens, Regina {{traveled}} to Germany {{to visit her}} brother. It was there she met geneticist and future Nobel Prize winner Hermann Joseph Muller, who persuaded her to move to Moscow to study medicine. She enrolled at I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, where she met Hans-Gerhardt, whom she married in November 1933. In 1938, Hans-Gerhardt and Regina had a daughter, Joan Fischer. The reemergence <b>of</b> <b>anti-Semitism</b> under Stalin prompted Regina to go with Joan to Paris, where Regina became an English teacher. The threat of a German invasion led her and Joan {{to go to the}} United States in 1939. Hans-Gerhardt attempted to follow the pair but, at that time, his German citizenship barred him from entering the United States. Regina and Hans-Gerhardt had separated in Moscow, although they did not officially divorce until 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{party was}} {{according}} to political scientist Cas Mudde only very rarely accused <b>of</b> <b>anti-Semitism</b> – and even then, it was strongly condemned {{by the party}} leadership. When Roeland Raes {{cast doubt on the}} scale of the Holocaust in a television interview in 2001 for instance, the party leadership immediately called an emergency meeting, distanced itself from him and forced him to resign. The party also took screening measures against its local candidates to reveal any possible extremist connections, and rather wanted to risk not being able to fill its lists, rather than filling them with extremists. Particularly, the party wanted to distance itself from Holocaust denial, as it actively sought to reach out to Jewish voters in Antwerp.|$|E

5|$|Lenin tasked Trotsky with {{establishing}} a Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, {{and with his}} support, Trotsky organised a Revolutionary Military Council in September 1918, remaining its chairman until 1925. Recognising their valuable military experience, Lenin agreed that officers from the old Tsarist army could serve in the Red Army, although Trotsky established military councils to monitor their activities. The Reds held control of Russia's two largest cities, Moscow and Petrograd, {{as well as most}} of Great Russia, while the Whites were located largely on the former Empire's peripheries. The latter were therefore hindered by being both fragmented and geographically scattered, and because their ethnic Russian supremacism alienated the region's national minorities. Anti-Bolshevik armies carried out the White Terror, a campaign of violence against perceived Bolshevik supporters which was typically more spontaneous than the state-sanctioned Red Terror. Both White and Red Armies were responsible for attacks against Jewish communities, prompting Lenin to issue a condemnation <b>of</b> <b>anti-Semitism,</b> blaming prejudice against Jews on capitalist propaganda.|$|E
25|$|Cockburn wrote a {{great deal}} on the use <b>of</b> <b>anti-Semitism</b> accusations in modern politics, {{particularly}} by the state of Israel and its supporters, and co-edited a book on the subject, The Politics <b>of</b> <b>Anti-Semitism.</b> Cockburn was accused <b>of</b> <b>anti-Semitism,</b> which he always denied. He considered it an example of the use of that accusation to intimidate criticism of Israel and avert attention from Israel's policies.|$|E
25|$|Promoting {{the concept}} of United States as a Judeo-Christian nation based upon Judeo-Christian ethics first became a {{political}} program in the 1940s, {{in response to the}} growth <b>of</b> <b>anti-Semitism</b> in America. Jews played a small role in that but the rise <b>of</b> <b>anti-semitism</b> in the 1930s led concerned Protestants, Catholics, and Jews to take steps to increase mutual understanding and lessen the high levels <b>of</b> <b>anti-semitism</b> in the United States.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{increasing}} {{integration of}} the Jews with secular society, a new form <b>of</b> <b>anti-Semitism</b> emerged, based on the ideas of race and nationhood rather than the religious hatred of the Middle Ages. This form <b>of</b> <b>anti-Semitism</b> held that Jews were a separate and inferior race from the Aryan people of Western Europe, {{and led to the}} emergence of political parties in France, Germany, and Austria-Hungary that campaigned on a platform of rolling back emancipation. This form <b>of</b> <b>anti-Semitism</b> emerged frequently in European culture, most famously in the Dreyfus Trial in France. These persecutions, along with state-sponsored pogroms in Russia in the late 19th century, led a number of Jews to believe that they would only be safe in their own nation.
