The study was based on 139 farm households randomly selected in the study area. The aim of the study was on some of the fundamental questions in relation to irrigation, farm productivity and poverty linkages: (1) Has irrigation {{played an important role in}} improving productivity and aggregate food production.

The analysis of data suggests that there are strong linkages between irrigation, crop productivity and poverty alleviation.

The results confirm that not only do foreign entrants tend to be above-average productive but they also find it easier to exit (particularly those entering in the form of acquisitions). Further, the least efficient firms are found to experience a drop in their survival probability upon a foreign firm’s entry. In addition, a foreign firm’s entry seems to stimulate the selection process not only within the industry but also through backward linkages in the upstream supplying industries. Regarding the productivity spillover effects from foreign to local firms the results suggest that they mostly <b>operate</b> through vertical <b>linkages</b> rather than within the same industry. foreign direct investment, firm selection process, crowding out, productivity spillovers, Slovenia...|$|R

Propagation of rifting along the S Kenya proto-rift during the last 8 Ma is first assumed to have <b>operated</b> by <b>linkage</b> of discrete magmatic cells as far S as the Ngorongoro–Kilimanjaro transverse volcanic belt that follows the margin of cratonic blocks in N Tanzania. Strain is believed to have nucleated throughout the thermally-weakened lithosphere in the transverse volcanic belt that might have later linked the S Kenya and N Tanzania rift segments with marked structural changes along-strike. The North Tanzanian Divergence is now regarded as a two-armed rift pattern involving: (1) a wide domain of tilted fault blocks to the W (Mbulu) that encompasses the Eyasi and Manyara fault systems, in direct continuation with the Natron northern trough. The reactivation of basement fabrics in the cold and intact Precambrian lithosphere in the Mbulu domain resulted in an oblique rift pattern that contrasts with the orthogonal extension that prevailed in the Magadi–Natron trough above a more attenuated lithosphere. (2) To the E, the Pangani horst-like range is thought to be a younger (< 1 Ma) structure that formed in response to the relocation of extension S of the Kilimanjaro magmatic center. A significant contrast in the mechanical behaviour of the stretched lithosphere in the North Tanzanian diverging rift is assumed to have occurred {{on both sides of the}} Masai cratonic block with a mid-crustal decoupling level to the W where asymmetrical fault-basin patterns are dominant (Magadi–Natron and Mbulu), whereas a component of dynamical uplift is suspected to have caused the topographic elevation of the Pangani range in relation with possible far-travelled mantle melts produced at depth further N...|$|R

The theoretically predicted channels through which inward FDI affects the firm dynamics in a host country prove to be in general significant. First, there is evidence of the direct impact offoreign firms through so-called direct technology transfer as foreign-owned firms have higher growth of TFP compared to domestically-owned firms after controlling for other determinants. Secondly, the entry of foreign firms stimulates the reshuffling of the resources from less to more efficient local firms. The firm selection process is, namely, characterised by the least efficient firms experiencing a drop in their employment growth upon a foreign firm’s entry. Thirdly, regarding the productivity spillover effects from foreign to local firms we provide indirect evidence that they mostly <b>operate</b> through vertical <b>linkages</b> rather than within the same industry.

40|$|Variations in the {{structure}} of the neocortex induced by single gene mutations may be extreme or subtle. They differ from variations in neocortical structure encountered across and within species in that these "normal" structural variations are adaptive (both structurally and behaviorally), whereas those associated with disorders of development are not. Here we propose that they also differ in principle in that they represent disruptions of molecular mechanisms that are not normally regulatory to variations in the histogenetic sequence. We propose an algorithm for the operation of the neuronogenetic sequence in relation to the overall neocortical histogenetic sequence and highlight the restriction point of the G 1 phase of the cell cycle as the master regulatory control point for normal coordinate structural variation across species and importantly within species.

The first is the rise of China (with the South East Asian region in tow) as the dominant force reshaping the competitive dynamics between developing and developed countries as well as within the developing world itself.

40|$|These {{experiments}} were {{prompted by the}} recent discovery that the intrinsic stiffness of the ankle is inadequate to stabilise passively the body in standing. Our hope was that showing how a large inverted pendulum was manually balanced with low intrinsic stiffness would elucidate the active control of human standing. The {{results show that the}} pendulum can be satisfactorily stabilised when intrinsic stiffness is low. Analysis of sway size shows that intrinsic stiffness actually plays little part in stabilisation. The sway duration is also substantially independent of intrinsic stiffness. This suggests that the characteristic sway of the pendulum, rather than being dictated by stiffness and inertia, may result from the control pattern of hand movements. The key points revealed by these experiments are that with low intrinsic stiffness the hand provides pendulum stability by intermittently altering the bias of the spring and, on average, the hand moves in opposition to the load. The results lead to a new and testable hypothesis; namely that in standing, the calf muscle shortens as the body sways forward and lengthens as it sways backwards. These findings are difficult to reconcile with stretch reflex control of the pendulum and are of particular relevance to standing. They may also be relevant to postural maintenance in general whenever the CNS controls muscles which <b>operate</b> through compliant <b>linkages.</b> The results also suggest that in standing, rather than providing passive stability, the intrinsic stiffness acts as an energy efficient buffer which provides decoupling between muscle and body...|$|R
