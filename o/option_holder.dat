The actual market price of the option may vary depending on a number of factors, such as a significant <b>option</b> <b>holder</b> may need to sell the option as the expiry date is approaching and does not have the financial resources to exercise the option, or a buyer in the market is trying to amass a large option holding. The ownership of an option does not generally entitle the holder to any rights associated with the underlying asset, such as voting rights or any income from the underlying asset, such as a dividend.|$|E

Several for-profit ventures {{involving}} the Slender Man have unequivocally acknowledged Knudsen as the creator of this fictional character, while others were civilly blocked from distribution (including the Kickstarter-funded film) after legal complaints from Knudsen and other sources. Though Knudsen himself has given his personal blessing to a number of Slender Man-related projects, the issue is complicated by the fact that, while he is the character's creator, a third party holds the options to any adaptations into other media, including film and television. The identity of this <b>option</b> <b>holder</b> has not been made public. Knudsen himself has argued that his enforcement of copyright {{has less to do with}} money than with artistic integrity: [...] "I just want something amazing to come off it... something that's scary and disturbing and kinda different. I would hate for something to come out and just be kinda conventional." [...] As of May 2016, the media rights to Slender Man have been sold to production company Mythology Entertainment.|$|E

50|$|One {{other reason}} for a company to buy back its own stock is to reward <b>holders</b> of stock <b>options.</b> Call <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> are hurt by {{dividend}} payments, since, typically, they are not eligible to receive them. A share buyback program may increase the value of remaining shares (if the buyback is executed when shares are under-priced); if so, call <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> benefit. A dividend payment short term always decreases the value of shares after the payment, so, for stocks with regularly scheduled dividends, on the day shares go ex-dividend, call <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> always lose whereas put <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> benefit. This {{does not apply to}} unscheduled (special) dividends since the strike prices of options are typically adjusted to reflect the amount of the special dividend. Finally, if the sellers into a corporate buyback are actually the call <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> themselves, they may directly benefit from temporary unrealistically favorable pricing.|$|R

40|$|How costly is the repriceable {{employee}} {{stock option}} This paper develops an intensity-based model, which reflects the special features of repriceable {{employee stock option}}s (ESOs), to assess their shareholder cost and explore their early exercise pattern. Several numerical analyses are used to examine how single or multiple resetting affects the value of ESOs. Three characteristics of repriceable options are found. First, their value does not monotonically increase {{with the amount of}} reduction of exercise price. Second, multiple resetting increases option value more than does single resetting. Lastly, <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> of repriceable ESOs postpone their exercise before repricing. But once the exercise price has been reset, <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> are more likely to exercise the ESOs early. The model used in this paper is proposed {{as an alternative to the}} Barrier Option pricing formula for measuring the cost of repriceable ESOs for accounting and regulation purposes. 1...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} {{evaluate}} the cost of repriceable options, and to investigate whether repriceable employee stock options (ESOs) cost more than standard ESOs in providing incentives to employees. Design/methodology/approach – This paper develops an intensity-based model, reflecting the special features of repriceable ESOs. The model is used to assess shareholder cost of repriceable ESOs, to explore their early exercise pattern and to compare their incentive effect with standard ESOs. Findings – Two main conclusions arise. First, <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> of repriceable ESOs postpone their exercise before repricing. But, once the exercise price has been reset, <b>option</b> <b>holders</b> {{are more likely to}} exercise ESOs early. Second, option repricing is less cost-effective than standard options in providing incentives. Practical implications – This research finds that issuing new options proves more efficient than option repricing in providing incentives. In turn, this research offers a practical guideline to companies confronted with underwater options. Originality/value – Constructing and applying a more accurate valuation model than those previously developed, this paper investigates several important questions about ESOs repricing. Chiefly, this research helps academics and practitioners better understand the cost of repriceable options, how repricing influences employees’ early exercise decisions, and whether option repricing is cost-effective in providing incentives. These are important questions to ask, filling gaps in the existing literature. Compensation, Employees, Incentive schemes, Stock options...|$|R
