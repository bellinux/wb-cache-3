5|$|By 1892, Mogadishu {{was under}} the joint control of the Somali Sultanate of the Geledi and the <b>Omani</b> Sultanate of Zanzibar. The Geledi Sultans were {{at the height of}} their power. They {{dominated}} the southern ivory trade, and also held sway over the Jubba and Shebelle valleys in the hinterland. The <b>Omani</b> Sultans' authority in Mogadishu, however, was largely nominal. When Imam Azzan bin Qais of Oman sought to build a fort in the city, he was thus obligated to request permission from Sultan Ahmed Yusuf of Geledi. This Fort of Garessa was eventually constructed in 1870. The Sultan of Zanzibar later leased and then sold the infrastructure that he had built to the Italians, but not the land itself, which was Somali owned.|$|E
5|$|Oman's National Committee for Civil Defence {{coordinated the}} country's {{preparations}} for Phet, utilizing a national disaster plan that organized the various ministries, and providing early warnings. Storm warnings were broadcast in seven languages, {{a response to}} there being only English and Arabic warnings during Cyclone Gonu, which struck Oman in 2007. Residents were advised to remain away from the rough seas during the storm. Businesses and schools were shut down in the areas the storm affected, with schools operating as emergency shelters near Muscat. About 85% of the isolated Masirah Island was evacuated; the passage of Phet and subsequent storms affecting the Arabian Peninsula influenced the <b>Omani</b> government's decision to build a fixed link with the island 40km (25mi) offshore. Nationwide, 12,870people evacuated, utilizing 91 government-opened shelters. <b>Omani</b> officials shut down the country's {{oil and gas production}} facilities during the storm.|$|E

50|$|However, {{when the}} <b>Omanis</b> relinquished control {{it did not}} bring peace to Bahrain; the {{political}} weakness of Persia meant that the islands were soon invaded by Huwala, who Al Bahrani says 'ruined' Bahrain. Almost constant warfare between various Sunni naval powers, the Kharajite <b>Omanis</b> and then the Persians under Nadir Shah and Karim Khan Zand laid waste to much of Bahrain, while the high taxes imposed by the <b>Omanis</b> drove out both the ulema-pearl merchants and the pearl divers - German Arabist Carsten Niebuhr found in 1763 that Bahrain's 360 towns and villages had through warfare and economic distress been reduced to only 60.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Omanis</b> fared much worse, getting {{last place}} in their group and failing to reach the {{knockout}} stages.|$|R
5|$|Sailing {{from the}} Indian state of Gujarat to Dubai, a ship with the call sign MSV Shiv Sagar MNV 2169 {{encountered}} Keila offshore southern Oman. The storm's high winds caused {{the boat to}} capsize, killing five of the sailors, and leaving nine others missing. Six of the crew were rescued by the <b>Omani</b> Coast Guard.|$|E
5|$|At times, Al Jalali {{served as}} a refuge or a jail for {{a member of the}} royal family. For much of the 20th century it was used as Oman's main prison, but this {{function}} ended in the 1970s. Fort al-Jalali was restored in 1983 and converted into a private museum of <b>Omani</b> cultural history that is accessible only to dignitaries visiting the country. Exhibits include cannons, old muskets and matchlocks, maps, rugs and other artifacts.|$|E
5|$|Lamu Fort {{was built}} between 1813 and 1821 with <b>Omani</b> assistance. Initially it {{provided}} a base from which the Omanis consolidated their control of the East African coast but the town later lost its economic importance. During the British colonial period, and after the independence of Kenya, the fort {{was used as a}} prison. Today it houses an environmental museum and library, and is often used for community events.|$|E
5000|$|Faced {{with so many}} restrictions, <b>Omanis</b> have {{resorted to}} {{unconventional}} methods for expressing their views. <b>Omanis</b> sometimes use donkeys to express their views. Writing about Gulf rulers in 2001, Dale Eickelman observed: [...] "Only in Oman has the occasional donkey… {{been used as a}} mobile billboard to express anti-regime sentiments. There is no way in which police can maintain dignity in seizing and destroying a donkey on whose flank a political message has been inscribed." ...|$|R

5|$|The Oman Chairman of the National Committee for Civil Defence, General Malek Bin Sulaiman Al Ma'amari, remarked {{the nation}} had already {{developed}} a contingency plan, {{which included the}} activation of army and police personnel after the storm's passage. Significant damage was expected, especially in northeastern areas, along with up to 150mm (6in) of rainfall and very strong winds. Officials recommended citizens evacuate from potentially affected areas, and about 7,000people were forced to leave Masirah Island due {{to the threat of}} high surf and strong winds. Overall, more than 20,000people evacuated to emergency shelters. A state of emergency was declared for the nation. The <b>Omani</b> national weather service warned that the cyclone was expected to be worse than the destructive cyclone that hit Masirah Island in 1977. The Mina al Fahal oil terminal closed for over three days due to the threat of the storm. <b>Omani</b> officials closed government offices for two days and declared a five-day-long national holiday. Most businesses near the coastline were closed prior to the announcement. Authorities at the Muscat International Airport (then named as Seeb International Airport) canceled of all flights after 2000UTC on June 5 due to the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Although characterised at {{the time}} and since as actions against piracy, this charge has been disputed by historians and archivists in the UAE in particular, notably the current Ruler of Sharjah, HH Dr Sheikh Sultan bin Muhammad Al-Qasimi in his book 'The Myth of Arabian Piracy in the Gulf'. The {{counter-argument}} is that the Al Qasimi, a strong and independent maritime force, were the subject of British aggression in an attempt to stamp its authority - and that of its <b>Omani</b> allies - on trade routes thought of as important to Iraq and India.|$|E
5|$|In Oman, {{production}} of desalinated water was interrupted, as both of Oman's desalination plants failed. The first, Ghubrah, lost supplies of natural gas, halting production; while the second, Barka, sustained a damaged switchgear due to flooding. These plants provided water to Muscat's 631,000residents and surrounding areas, triggering severe water shortages across eastern Oman. To rectify the situation, officials used water tanks. The water returned to near normal in five days, {{as the two}} plants returned to service. Additionally, electricians worked quickly to repair the power outages across the region. Five days after Gonu hit, utilities were restored to most of Muscat and the coastal provinces. The <b>Omani</b> army assisted residents in returning to their houses. Even though the <b>Omani</b> government did not request any international aid, the United States offered assistance through naval ships in the area; this was eventually rejected. The country lost an estimated $200million (2007USD) in oil exports. In the months after the storm, the government allocated funds {{for the removal of}} debris and trees, as well as restoration of roads in tourist areas. Additionally, the National Committee for Civil Defence set up 139buildings to provide temporary housing for 8,192people. Services such as water and electricity were gradually restored, and people returned to their homes. By two weeks after the storm's passage, most of those remaining in shelters were from Qurayat, one of the most severely affected villages.|$|E

50|$|Between 1794 and 1868, Bandar Abbas {{was under}} the control of the Sultanate of Oman and Zanzibar through a lease {{agreement}} with Persia. The details of the original lease apparently differed between the Arabic and Persian versions. The <b>Omanis</b> controlled the coastal stretch of some 100 miles from Sadij to Khamir, and inland about 30 miles, as far as Shamil. They also controlled the islands of Hormuz and Qeshm. In 1823, the Persians attempted to oust the <b>Omanis,</b> but the sultan managed to keep his hold on Bandar through bribery and tribute of the governor of Shiraz. In 1845-46, an army under the governor general of Fars menaced Bandar to extort tribute, while another army under the governor of Kerman besieged Minab. The <b>Omanis</b> threatened to blockade Persia, but the British resident at Bushir convinced them to back down.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{other districts}} in the Manama Souq, Fareeq el-Fadhel used to be {{inhabited}} by <b>Omanis,</b> Indians (especially the Buhra) and Jewish families, alongside the Baharna.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Bahrain was invaded {{by both the}} Omanis and the Al Sauds. In 1802 it was governed by a 12-year-old child, when the <b>Omani</b> ruler Sayyid Sultan {{installed}} his son, Salim, as Governor in the Arad Fort. In 1816, the British political resident in the Gulf, William Bruce, {{received a letter from}} the Sheikh of Bahrain who was concerned about a rumour that Britain would support an attack on the island by the Imam of Muscat. He sailed to Bahrain to reassure the Sheikh that {{this was not the case}} and drew up an informal agreement assuring the Sheikh that Britain would remain a neutral party.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{there was}} a total of seven {{depressions}} and four cyclonic storms. The most intense and deadly tropical cyclone of the season, the West Bengal cyclone, lashed that province of India and Bangladesh {{in the month of}} November. Rough seas offshore caused at least 173drownings offshore Bangladesh and India, while over 100people were left missing. In West Bengal alone, 124fatalities were reported, with over one hundred people still missing. Flooding occurred there and some areas of Bangladesh, particularly the capital city of Dhaka. Another notable storm was the Oman cyclone in May. It made a rare landfall in the <b>Omani</b> region of Dhofar. The storm brought historic rainfall to Oman, which in turn brought flooding to the region. Nine people drowned and damage to property, crops, and transportation reached $25million (2002USD).|$|E
5|$|Jaguars were {{successfully}} {{sold to a}} number of overseas countries, India being the most prolific operator. The Jaguar International was an export version which was sold to Ecuador, Nigeria and Oman. The Ecuadorian Air Force, the only Latin American export customer, purchased 10 single- and 2 two-seat variants, officially designated Jaguars ES and EB, respectively. The first of twelve aircraft arrived in January 1977. They were used mainly for ground attack roles and occasionally for air superiority duties during the Cenepa War with Peru in 1995, but {{the main part of the}} fleet was held in reserve in case of a wider conflict with the Peruvians. Nigeria ordered 13 single-seat SN and 5 two-seat BN variants; SEPECAT delivered the first of these in May 1984. A subsequent order for an 18-aircraft second batch was cancelled. Some of those in service were withdrawn from operations on the grounds of economy, with the remaining aircraft put up for re-sale. The Royal Air Force of Oman, like Ecuador, ordered 10 single-seat and 2 two-seat variants, designated Jaguars OS and OB, respectively; the first was delivered in March 1977. A second identical 12-aircraft order was placed in the mid-1980s; these were joined by two ex-IAF and ex-RAF examples. The last of the <b>Omani</b> aircraft were retired on 6 August 2014.|$|E

25|$|Rain reduced Papua New Guinea's {{match against}} Oman to a 24 over-a-side affair. The Papuans reached 134 for 7 in their overs, before skittling the <b>Omanis</b> for 41 all out.|$|R
5|$|Offshore the Arabian Peninsula, the cyclone {{produced}} rough {{waves that}} disabled an oil tanker; {{the crew was}} rescued by the <b>Omani</b> Coast Guard after being stranded for a few days. A fishing boat was damaged after being washed ashore near Ras Madrakah, killing {{one person in the}} crew of nine. Near where the storm moved ashore, the storm's strong winds heavily damaged the village of Ras Madrakah. Considered the worst storm in memory, the cyclone wrecked workshops and buildings, including damaging the roof of the desalination plant, leaving residents without water for several days. Strong winds of over 93km/h (58mph) knocked down 20trees in Rima that were planted to provide shade for government buildings. Across the storm's track through Oman, the rains replenished water levels in aquifers, while also washing out roads and isolating villages. This lack of transportation prevented prompt repair work. The Jiddat al-Harasis desert was flooded for over a month due to the storm, killing two people due to drowning in Al-Ghubra. The floods provided grazing for the endangered oryx population, although many livestock were killed. Three airports in the country were closed due to floods up to four days.|$|E
5|$|Strong winds {{knocked out}} power and {{telephone}} lines across the eastern {{region of the}} country, leaving thousands isolated until the lines were repaired hours later. The cyclone caused extensive damage along the coastline, including {{in the city of}} Sur and the village of Ras al Hadd at the easternmost point of the <b>Omani</b> mainland. In Muscat, winds reached 100km/h (62mph), leaving the capital city without power. Strong waves and heavy rainfall flooded streets and some buildings. Police workers in the city sent text messages to keep people away from flooded streets to prevent electrocutions. Little damage was reported to the oil fields of the nation. The liquefied natural gas terminal in Sur, which handles 10million tonnes of gas each year, was badly hit by the storm and could not be operated. Overall, the cyclone killed 50people in the country; by the fourth day after it struck the country, 27 people had been reported missing. Around 20,000people were affected, and damage in the country was estimated at around $4.2billion (2007USD).|$|E
25|$|Muscat has {{a number}} of museums. These include Museum of <b>Omani</b> Heritage, National Museum of Oman, Oman Children's Museum, Bait Al Zubair, Oman Oil and Gas Exhibition Centre, <b>Omani</b> French Museum, Sultan's Armed Forces Museum and the <b>Omani</b> Aquarium and Marine Science and Fisheries Centre. The Bait Al Falaj Fort played an {{important}} role in Muscat's military history.|$|E
50|$|By about 250 BC, the Parthian dynasty {{had brought}} the Persian Gulf under their control. They {{extended}} their influence as far as Oman, establishing garrisons there to exert control over the trade routes in the Persian Gulf. In the 3rd century AD, the Sassanids succeeded the Parthians and held the area until the rise of Islam, four centuries later. <b>Omanis</b> {{were among the first}} people to come in contact with and accept Islam. The conversion of the <b>Omanis</b> is usually ascribed to Amr ibn al-As, who was sent by the prophet Muhammad during the Expedition of Zaid ibn Haritha (Hisma).|$|R
5|$|For {{most of the}} 20th century Fort al-Jalali was {{the main}} prison in Oman, holding about 200 prisoners. Some were <b>Omanis</b> from the {{interior}} captured during the Jebel Akhdar War (1954–59), or taken after that war. Other prisoners were taken during the Dhofar Rebellion (1962–76).|$|R
25|$|Cricket was {{introduced}} to Oman during the {{time when it was}} a British protectorate. The sport is popular amongst Oman's South Asian expatriate population, and has more recently been taken up by native <b>Omanis.</b> The governing body of cricket in the country is Oman Cricket.|$|R
