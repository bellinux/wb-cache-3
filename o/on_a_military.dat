5|$|After {{two months}} of planning, Bonaparte decided that France's naval power was not yet strong enough to confront the British Royal Navy. He decided <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> {{expedition}} to seize Egypt and thereby undermine Britain's access to its trade interests in India. Bonaparte wished to establish a French presence in the Middle East, with the ultimate dream of linking with Tipu Sultan, a Muslim enemy of the British in India.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the fate}} of Laos did not depend <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> {{solution}} in the air or {{on the ground in}} Laos and could only be decided by the outcome in Vietnam, winning the war against the DRV in northern Laos was not the objective. Instead, maintaining access to the country was paramount and keeping the Royal Lao government in power became the primary objective.|$|E

5|$|As the 11th New York Regiment had {{experienced}} first hand, the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861 {{had taken a}} heavy toll on Union forces, including those from New York City. As the war dragged <b>on,</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> manpower shortage occurred in the Union and Congress passed the first conscription act in United States history on March 3, 1863, authorizing the President to draft male citizens {{between the ages of}} 18 and 35 for a three-year term of military service.|$|E
5|$|Humble left Rice in 1943 for the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, {{then called}} Southwestern Louisiana Institute, {{to prepare for}} service in World War II in a V-12 U.S. Navy {{training}} program. As he trained, he played alongside enlistees from Tulane University, the University of Tulsa and Louisiana State University <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> team that won six straight games and was selected {{to play in the}} first Oil Bowl in Houston. Captained by Humble, Southwestern beat a service team from Randolph Air Force Base in San Antonio.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, Chamberlin became Assistant Chief of the Construction Branch in the G-4 Division of War Department General Staff. At this time, the United States was embarking <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> {{buildup in}} {{response}} to a worsening international situation, which culminated in the outbreak of World War II on 1 September 1939. A major component of this build up was a vast construction program of arsenals, depots, airbases and coastal defenses. Some $175 million was allocated to construction under the Expansion Program, as it became known.|$|E

5|$|In April 1937, Sayn-Wittgenstein decided <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> {{career and}} joined the 17th Cavalry Regiment in Bamberg. He {{transferred}} to the Luftwaffe {{in the summer of}} 1937 and, in October, he was accepted at the flight training school in Braunschweig. He received his officer's commission and was promoted to Leutnant (second lieutenant) in June 1938. Sayn-Wittgenstein served on various air bases from where he flew the Junkers Ju 88 and the Heinkel He 111. In the winter of 1938–39 he served as a Kampfbeobachter (combat observer or navigator) in Kampfgeschwader 54 (KG54—54th Bomber Wing) based at Fritzlar.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet's father decided <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> {{career for}} his son, but {{felt that the}} local {{education}} available to him would not be adequate preparation. At the age of nine, James was sent {{to live with his}} aunt and uncle in Augusta, Georgia. His uncle, Augustus Baldwin Longstreet, was a newspaper editor, educator, and a Methodist minister. James spent eight years on his uncle's plantation, Westover, just outside the city while he attended the Academy of Richmond County. His father died from a cholera epidemic while visiting Augusta in 1833; although James's mother {{and the rest of the}} family moved to Somerville, Alabama, following his father's death, James remained with uncle Augustus. Augustus Longstreet, a man of some political prominence, was a fierce states' rights partisan who supported South Carolina during the Nullification Crisis.|$|E
5|$|Malone {{had been}} {{convinced}} {{for some time}} that war was on the horizon and prepared himself accordingly. He studied military history and practices intensively, and underwent a physical fitness and conditioning programme in preparation for military service. This reputedly included his sleeping <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> camp bed. Upon the outbreak of the First World War, he volunteered for service either in New Zealand or overseas. Well regarded by his superiors in the Territorial Force, he was made commander of the Wellington Infantry Battalion of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF).|$|E

5|$|The Tupolev OKB {{began work}} in September 1946 <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> {{transport}} {{version of the}} Tupolev Tu-70 airliner and this was confirmed by the Council of Ministers on 11 March 1947 with state trials to begin in August 1948. To expedite the process, maximum use was made of components of the Tu-70. Its engines were the uprated Shvetsov ASh-73TKFN or TKNV fuel-injected version. A new, narrower fuselage was designed, which included a rear cargo hatch, a vehicle loading ramp and paratroop exit doors. Three gun turrets (dorsal, ventral and tail), were to be adapted from the Tu-4, although they were not fitted on the prototype. It had a crew of six (two pilots, three gunners, a radio operator, and a navigator).|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the season, Anet, Gale, and Wintermute were {{selected}} as All-Americans. In the 1939–40 season, the Webfoots were unable to defend their PCC championship, finishing second behind Oregon State in the division; the following season, {{all but one of the}} players from the championship team had graduated, and the Webfoots ended tied for third. The team did not win the Northern Division again until 1944–45. Hobson left the program before the 1947–48 season to become Yale's men's basketball head coach. Gale and Wintermute later played professional basketball in the National Basketball League; both were members of the same team, the Detroit Eagles, and Anet declined an offer to join them. Dick briefly played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball before embarking <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> career of over 30 years after the U.S. entered World War II. Anet and Johansen joined a Eugene, Oregon-based AAU team, the Rubenstein's Oregonians, and helped the club win a state title and reach the quarterfinals of the AAU's national basketball tournament in 1940. Bob Hardy and Mullen both played minor league baseball, and Mullen reached the major leagues with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Berry was {{the only}} member of the family thought to be able to beget children. His wife gave birth to a posthumous son in September, Henry, Duke of Bordeaux, nicknamed Dieudonné (God-given) by the Bourbons because he was thought to have secured the future of the dynasty. However the Bourbon {{succession}} was still in doubt. The Chamber of Deputies proposed amending Salic law to allow the Duchess of Angoulême to accede to the throne. On 12 June 1820, the Chambers ratified legislation that increased the number of deputies from 258 to 430. The extra deputies were to be elected by the wealthiest quarter of the population in each département. These individuals now effectively had two votes. Around the same time as the “law of the two votes”, Louis XVIII began to receive visits every Wednesday from a lady named Zoé Talon, and ordered that nobody should disturb him while he was with her. It was rumoured that he inhaled snuff from her breasts, which earned her the nickname of tabatière (snuffbox). In 1823, France embarked <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> intervention in Spain, where a revolt had occurred against the King Ferdinand VII. France succeeded in crushing the rebellion, an effort headed by the Duke of Angoulême.|$|E

5|$|Cave Story {{takes place}} within the {{cavernous}} interior of a floating island. The island is populated by Mimigas, a race of sentient, rabbit-like creatures. A particular species of red flower that grows in the island causes the normally peaceful Mimigas to fall into a violent frenzy when ingested. The island also conceals an artifact called the Demon Crown, which has vast magical powers. An army of robot soldiers {{was sent to the}} floating island <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> expedition, seeking to harness the Demon Crown as a weapon for wars on the surface world. These robots slaughtered Mimigas indiscriminately in their search for the crown, but were defeated when the Mimigas decided to eat the red flowers as a last resort. Shortly before the game begins, Professor Booster, the Sakamoto family, and various assistants formed a scientific party to research the island, but they became stranded when their medical doctor managed to acquire the Crown: he then forced the expedition to search for the red flowers.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{seemingly}} {{loved his}} young wife, lavishing gifts on her. On {{the occasion of}} their first New Year in 1386, {{he gave her a}} red velvet palfrey saddle, trimmed with copper and decorated with an intertwined K and E (for Karol and Elisabeth), and he continued to give her gifts of rings, tableware and clothing. The uncles too, apparently, were pleased with the match, which contemporary chroniclers, notably Froissart and Michel Pintoin (the Monk of St. Denis), describe similarly as a match rooted in desire and based on her beauty. The day after the wedding, Charles went <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> campaign against the English, and Isabeau went to Creil to live with his step great-grandmother Queen Dowager Blanche, who taught her courtly traditions. In September she took up residence at the Château de Vincennes, where {{in the early years of}} their marriage Charles frequently joined her, and which became her favorite home.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about Stefan's childhood. His family {{could not afford to}} send him to a {{university}} abroad (only one of his brothers would do so); hence he embarked early <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> career. Before that, he attended a jesuit college, either in Kraków or Sandomierz, achieving a solid secondary education. After finishing his schooling, he became a courtier to then-royal prince and future king of Poland John II Casimir Vasa. As Stefan could not afford the equipment needed to join a hussar unit, he learned the art of war serving with the Lisowczycy mercenaries, joining them as towarzysz (companion, a junior cavalry officer) in the spring of 1621. Already an officer at the age of eighteen, he took part in the battle of Chocim (Khotyn) in 1621, where the Commonwealth army stopped the Ottomans and ended the Polish–Ottoman War (1620–21). His years with the brutal Lisowczycy mercenaries would impact his strategy in the latter years, where he would not hesitate to use any means necessary – including mistreatment of civilians – to achieve victory.|$|E

5|$|Roddenberry {{spent the}} {{remainder}} of his military career in the United States, and while he did not keep an ongoing record, he estimated that he had flown 89 combat missions. This number was disputed by the records of the Army Air Corps {{and other members of the}} 394th Bomber Squadron. For example, one pilot in the same bomb group as Roddenberry flew eighty missions, but took three times longer than Roddenberry had claimed to do so. In October, he was assigned to Fort Worth, Texas and then the 18th Replacement Wing at Salt Lake City. He was subsequently moved to the Office of Flight Safety based in Oakland, California. In February 1944, he moved back to March Field and was promoted to Captain and subsequently flew all over the United States in his role as a plane crash investigator. During this time he was in another accident as a passenger <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> flight that crashed and caught fire. Roddenberry pulled three men to safety. During his military career, he was awarded the Air Medal and the Distinguished Flying Cross.|$|E
5|$|The Kaga Rebellion or Chōkyō Uprising was a {{large-scale}} revolt in Kaga Province (present-day southern Ishikawa Prefecture), Japan, in late 1487 through 1488. Togashi Masachika, who ruled Kaga Province as shugo, had been restored {{to power in}} 1473 with aid from the Asakura clan {{as well as the}} Ikkō-ikki, a loose collection of lesser nobility, monks, and farmers. By 1474, however, the Ikkō-ikki grew discontent with Masachika, and launched some initial revolts, which were easily quelled. In 1487, when Masachika left <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> campaign, between one hundred thousand and two hundred thousand Ikkō-ikki revolted. Masachika returned with his army, but the Ikkō-ikki, backed by several disaffected vassal families, overwhelmed his army and surrounded him in his palace, where he committed seppuku. The former vassals of Masachika granted the position of shugo to Masachika's uncle Yasutaka, but over the next several decades the Ikkō-ikki increased their political hold on the province, which they would effectively control for almost a century.|$|E
5|$|However, the Americans {{were not}} {{counting}} on Thảo {{and his fellow}} Catholic Phát trying to seize power on an explicitly religious platform, claiming fidelity to slain former Catholic President Ngô Đình Diệm and promising to recall Khiêm from the US to lead the new regime. This caused alarm among the Buddhist majority, who had campaigned heavily against Diệm's discriminatory religious policies {{in the months leading}} up to his ouster in November 1963. Although they wanted Khánh gone, the Americans did not want Thảo and Phát to succeed, so they sought out Kỳ and Thi in an attempt to have them defeat the original coup and then depose Khánh. During the initial attack, Thảo and Phát tried to capture both Khánh and Kỳ, but both men escaped narrowly, although some of their colleagues in the Armed Forces Council were arrested. Although the rebels were able to take control of Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the largest in the country and the military headquarters of South Vietnam, Kỳ was able to regroup quickly and retain control of the nearby Bien Hoa Air Base, using it to mobilize air power and stop the rebel advance with threats of bombing. Late in the night, Thảo and Phát met Kỳ in a meeting arranged by the Americans, where an agreement was reached for the coup to be ended in return for Khánh's ouster. By early next morning, the bloodless military action was over as Thảo and Phát went into hiding, and the junta voted to sack their leader Khánh, who was absent <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>military</b> inspection tour, thinking that Kỳ and Thi were on his side.|$|E
