5|$|<b>Our</b> <b>dream</b> {{began in}} the hearts of the {{students}} at Martin Luther King, Jr., Elementary School nearly ten years ago. The dream was nurtured by the late state Senator Bill McCoy, and through the donations of Oregonians and some of our state's most respected businesses; we will have an original work of art honoring the memory and ideals of one of America's greatest leaders.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Meet the Fockers was {{released}} as {{a sequel to}} Meet the Parents. Directed again by Jay Roach with a screenplay by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg, the sequel chronicles the events that take place when the Byrnes family meets Bernie and Roz Focker, Greg's parents, played by Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand. The producers intended for Greg's parents to be {{the opposite of the}} Byrnes' conservative, upper class, WASPy demeanor; to that effect, producer Jane Rosenthal explains that [...] "Dustin Hoffman and Barbra Streisand were <b>our</b> <b>dream</b> team." [...] Meet the Fockers proved to be another financial success grossing $280 million domestically and $516 million worldwide, outperforming Meet the Parents by a large margin and finishing as the fourth highest-grossing film of 2004.|$|E
500|$|The {{effect of}} being {{shuttled}} {{into and out}} of the homes of family members led to a feeling of not being wanted, which made Washington extremely shy as a youth. The only time he recalls feeling a sense of self-worth was when his great-grandmother on his father's side had the pair for a while. [...] According to Washington, she loved the boys but was extremely strict, domineering, and at times, physically abusive. [...] After his father remarried, the children moved back in with him and his new wife. Washington felt a sense of optimism for the first time, saying [...] "I thought it was <b>our</b> <b>dream</b> come true. All our lives we had seen nice families on TV. Real ones. Now we were going to be a real family." [...] However, he again felt unwanted this time by his stepmother. As a small child, Washington said that he had no recollections of ever being hugged, and only felt close to his younger brother, Chris. Washington was a poor student who hated school throughout most of his childhood. He had to retake many of his classes in summer school to raise his grades. When he entered high school he played football merely so he could be around a close friend, and have someone to walk home with at night as he was terrified of walking home alone.|$|E

2500|$|In Northern Africa, Tlemcen in Algeria {{was called}} [...] "Jerusalem of the West". In the 15th-century, {{the town was}} {{considered}} a major Jewish spiritual centre.

He wrote: [...] "We were living <b>our</b> <b>dream</b> {{in the midst of the}} beautiful countryside of the Maghreb.

2500|$|November 30 to December 2, 1994 was the {{brightest}} {{moment in the}} history of Orthodoxy in North America. For the first time, twenty-nine Orthodox bishops from the United States and Canada gathered at the Antiochian Village to pray together, discuss Orthodox problems together and formulate a common vision for the future. This brotherly and well-meaning meeting caused an unexpected earthquake in some of the ancient Orthodox Patriarchates.

2500|$|In March 2014, it was {{announced}} that Formula E was working with New York City authorities to bring a motor race to the area. Formula E's founder Alejandro Agag told CNN in May 2016 that he was [...] "very optimistic" [...] about the possibility of hosting an event in the city: [...] "I've just come from New York looking at different venues, different possibilities. It's far from done yet but we are very optimistic. <b>Our</b> <b>dream</b> would be to have a race in New York." [...] Originally, planners considered Governors Island, Central Park, and Liberty State Park in Jersey City as possible locations for the track. However, these sites were not chosen since a Governors Island track would have been too costly; a Central Park track would have required demolishing trees; and Liberty State Park was outside the city limits. New York City deputy mayor Alicia Glen visited Paris in May 2016. After attending the ePrix, she lent her support to the New York City race with backing from the New York City Economic Development Corporation. A one-year contract to stage the event was signed with the option for a renewal every year for the next ten years.|$|E
