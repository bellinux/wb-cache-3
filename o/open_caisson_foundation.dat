40|$|As an {{extension}} of the elastic multi-spring model developed by the authors in a companion paper [Gerolymos N, Gazetas G. Winkler model for lateral response of rigid <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> in linear soil. Soil Dyn Earthq Eng; 2005 (submitted companion paper). ], this paper develops a nonlinear Winkler-spring method for the static, cyclic, and dynamic response of <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations.</b> The nonlinear soil reactions along the circumference and on the base of the caisson are modeled realistically by using suitable couple translational and rotational nonlinear interaction springs and dashpots, which can realistically (even if approximately) model such effects as separation and slippage at the caisson-soil interface, uplift of the caisson base, radiation damping, stiffness and strength degradation with large number of cycles. The method is implemented in a new finite difference time-domain code, NL-CAISSON. An efficient numerical methodology is also developed for calibrating the model parameters using a variety of experimental and analytical data. The necessity for the proposed model arises from the difficulty to predict the large-amplitude dynamic response of caissons up to failure, statically or dynamically. In a subsequent companion paper [Gerolymos N, Gazetas G. Static and dynamic response of massive <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> with soil and interface nonlinearities - validation and results. Soil Dyn Earthq Eng; 2005 (submitted companion paper). ], the model is validated against in situ medium-scale static load tests and results of 3 D finite element analysis.

40|$|A {{wide range}} of new {{offshore}} applications are emerging in the energy sector. The {{oil and gas industry}} is targeting minimum facility applications, whilst the renewable energy sector is developing offshore wind turbines, {{as well as a number}} of wave and tidal energy devices. The design and installation of the foundations are key considerations in the financial viability of such offshore engineering projects. Suction <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> are a potential solution for these new developments, but design guidance is relatively sparse. This paper considers the vertical loading response of a <b>caisson</b> <b>foundation</b> in clay, during installation and under both monotonic and cyclic vertical loading. The main contribution is the presentation and interpretation of high quality experimental data. Vertical loading is critical for the design of a multi-footing structure of the type that might be used for large offshore wind turbines. We first consider the installation behaviour and compare data from pushed installations and a suction installation with results from a theoretical calculation. We then consider cyclic vertical loading tests, focussing on cyclic amplitudes that take the foundation into tension.

40|$|Many {{major river}} bridges were {{constructed}} in highgly active seismic areas of India much before the seismic code development.

An example problem of Saraighat Bridge located in high Himalayan seismic zone is considered to demonstrate the application of the methodology. Field investigation and advanced laboratory tests on soil samples from the bridge site were carried out. The test results reveal that the soil is susceptible to liquefaction and as a result, soil structure interaction analyses are carried out. It is shown that good performance of these type of bridges depend on the displacement response of the pier head so as not to cause unseating of the decks.

40|$|Suction {{caissons}} are a type {{of offshore}} foundation that allow for fast and noise-free installation and decommissioning of offshore structures. They {{have been used for}} 20 years in {{the oil and gas industry}} and are also becoming more common in the offshore wind sector as a promising way to cost reduction. SPT is a leading contractor for the installation of both single anchor piles and <b>foundations</b> on multiple <b>caissons.</b> The suction caissons are installed by applying a differential pressure between the inner and outer sides of the caissons, which pushes the caissons into the soil. When a platform is founded on multiple suction caissons, the way the wind and wave loads are transferred through the structure and various caissons into the soil will depend on the stiffness of both the platform and the caissons. The design of the substructure and suction caissons should thus be combined to include the effects of soil-structure interaction. This is currently done by modelling the suction <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> as a set of linear-elastic springs attached to the substructure. These springs are however not able to capture the non-linear behaviour that is often characteristic for soils. A method has been developed to model the suction <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> using non-linear springs. The characteristics of the springs are determined using FEM calculations with a nonlinear soil model in the geotechnical software PLAXIS. The springs are then implemented in a structural model of the substructure and the multiple foundations in the structural software SACS. The resulting loads on and displacements of the suction <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations</b> for a test load case have been compared to results from a complete FE model and a model that uses linear-elastic springs. The comparison has shown that the developed model gives results that match well with the results from the full FE model. The linear-elastic model on the other hand gives results that deviate significantly for high loads. When the stresses in the soil increase the soil will behave softer, leading to an increase of the displacements of the suction caissons for high loads. The substructure will help decrease large differences between the displacements of the suction caissons, resulting in a more even load distribution over the foundations and thus smaller design loads for the suction caissons. This allows for smaller suction caissons and savings of material and costs. The model with nonlinear springs is able to predict this behaviour of the soil and the substructure accurately and can be used to make a more efficient design of suction <b>caisson</b> <b>foundations.</b> </p...|$|R
