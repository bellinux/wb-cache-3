Rain after lunch caused the test to be halted, when the test resumed Räikkönen was forced to finish early when his car {{experienced}} electronic problems. Scott Speed achieved the second fastest time, two tenths of a second behind Räikkönen, with Seven tenths separating the first eight drivers. The Red Bull team focused <b>on</b> <b>testing</b> their suspension. Rubens Barrichello and Christian Klien shared testing for the Honda team over the day, however Klien's engine failed on his first lap. James Rossiter in the Super Aguri completed the most laps with 115.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Lara Means (Kristen Cloke) is {{examining}} evidence relating to Johnston's murder; she discovers that Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) had suppressed infrared post-mortem photographs. Learning of this, the Elder (Philip Baker Hall)—a high-ranking Group official—demands an explanation; Watts divulges that the murdered {{man had been}} conspiring to pit conflicting faction within the Group against each other. Watts had found evidence {{in one of the}} photographs which may have influenced such a schism and wished to keep it hidden until its significance could be known. The Elder agrees, and similarly decides to hold off <b>on</b> <b>testing</b> which would reveal if an artefact in Johnston's possession was an authentic piece of the True Cross.|$|E

40|$|Daily {{feed intake}} (DFI) was {{described}} as a function of days <b>on</b> <b>test</b> using a spline random regression model. Order of fit for the spline random regression model was varied, models were compared using Schwarz's Bayesian Information Criterion. The objective was to investigate whether there are genetic differences in DFI patterns. Data were DFI records of 257 growing gilts, which had ad libitum access to food. Gilts were 94 days old at start of test. All gilts were from a Dutch Landrace line. Number of random regression coefficients was varied from zero to nine for both random effects (animal and permanent environment), the model with four random regression coefficients resulted in the most optimal fit. Six traits were derived to capture differences in DFI patterns, average DFI over test, variance of DFI over test, DFI at day 5 <b>on</b> <b>test,</b> DFI at day 50 <b>on</b> <b>test,</b> DFI at day 95 <b>on</b> <b>test</b> and the difference between DFI at day 95 and day 5. Heritability for DFI decreased from 0. 53 at 5 days <b>on</b> <b>test</b> to 0. 24 at 95 days <b>on</b> <b>test.</b> Genetic correlations between DFI at 5 days <b>on</b> <b>test</b> and 95 days <b>on</b> <b>test,</b> and between DFI at 50 days <b>on</b> <b>test</b> and 95 days <b>on</b> <b>test</b> were low (around 0. 3). The results suggested that DFI at different days <b>on</b> <b>test</b> could not be regarded as repeated measurements of a single trait with constant variance and heritability. Based on the results presented, it can be concluded that changes in feed intake patterns through selection are possible. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

5|$|Following the Austrian Grand Prix on 16 July, {{the teams}} {{conducted}} testing sessions at three circuits from 18–21 July {{to prepare for}} the Grand Prix. McLaren, Benetton, Jordan, Jaguar, Sauber and BAR went to Silverstone over three days. Olivier Panis, McLaren's test driver, set the fastest time {{on the first day of}} testing. Jaguar test driver Luciano Burti crashed at Stowe corner where his car's suspension, front and rear wings, and sidepod were damaged. The resulting incident caused a brief halt to testing and Jaguar shipped a spare car for the next day's testing. Panis remained fastest on the second day. Trulli damaged his suspension and rear wing, resulting in repairs which limited his team's testing time. Burti suffered another incident when he lost his right rear wheel. Fisichella topped the third and final day's running. Ferrari test driver Luca Badoer spent four days at the Fiorano Circuit where he concentrated <b>on</b> <b>testing</b> engine and aerodynamic development whilst Michael Schumacher did practice starts and component testing on the fourth day.|$|E

50|$|The book {{presents}} several {{arguments that}} IQ tests are not biased. African Americans' lower average performance <b>on</b> IQ <b>tests</b> cannot {{be because of}} differences in vocabulary, because African Americans have slightly better performance <b>on</b> verbal <b>tests</b> than <b>on</b> nonverbal <b>tests.</b> The IQ difference also cannot be because the <b>tests</b> depend <b>on</b> White culture, or that Whites inevitably do better <b>on</b> <b>tests</b> designed by Whites. In fact, Blacks perform better <b>on</b> <b>tests</b> that are culturally loaded than they do <b>on</b> <b>tests</b> designed to not include cultural references unfamiliar to Blacks, and Japanese children tend to outscore White children {{by an average of}} six points. Nor can the difference be a reflection of socioeconomic status, because when Black and White children are tested who are at the same socioeconomic level, the difference between their average IQs is still twelve points.|$|R

25|$|The role {{of sleep}} in memory {{has long been}} suspected.

Many studies introduced some constraint <b>on</b> <b>test</b> sites and costs in the optimization model [65, 66, 68]; however, we are not aware of a general model or a systematic study on the characteristics of the solutions of such optimization problems.|$|R
30|$|The {{interaction}} effect between test value and other latent variables was also examined: Test value {{has a positive}} effect <b>on</b> <b>test</b> anxiety (β[*]=[*]. 22), but shows no significant relationship with intrinsic motivation and extrinsic motivation. As for the effect of learning motivation <b>on</b> <b>test</b> performance, results show that only extrinsic motivation has a positive effect (β[*]=[*]. 17) <b>on</b> <b>test</b> performance, {{while there is no}} significant relationship between intrinsic motivation and test performance. In other words, in order to improve students’ performance <b>on</b> English <b>tests,</b> it is important to increase their extrinsic learning motivation. In addition, there is no relationship between test anxiety and learning motivation. Results also show there is a significant negative effect (β[*]=[*]−. 29) of <b>test</b> anxiety <b>on</b> <b>test</b> performance. The various relationships among learning motivation, test anxiety, and test performance in this study echo those reported by Cheng et al. in their findings.|$|R
25|$|The USAF Special Air Warfare Center was {{activated}} 27 April 1962, {{with the}} 1st Combat Applications Group (CAG) organized as a combat systems development and test agency under the SAWC.

25|$|Because {{testing was}} seen as a sign of {{technological}} development (the ability to design usable weapons without some form of testing was considered dubious), halts <b>on</b> <b>testing</b> were often called for as stand-ins for halts in the nuclear arms race itself, and many prominent scientists and statesmen lobbied for a ban on nuclear testing. In 1958, the U.S., USSR, and the United Kingdom (a new nuclear power) declared a temporary testing moratorium for both political and health reasons, but by 1961 the Soviet Union had broken the moratorium and both the USSR and the U.S. began testing with great frequency.|$|E
25|$|A 1935 {{article in}} Popular Aviation magazine, which renewed {{interest}} in Whitehead, said winter weather ruined the Number 22 airplane after Whitehead placed it unprotected in his yard following his claimed flights of January 1902. The article said Whitehead did not have money to build a shelter for the aircraft because of a quarrel with his financial backer. The article also reported that in early 1903 Whitehead built a 200-horsepower eight-cylinder engine, intended to power a new aircraft. Another financial backer insisted <b>on</b> <b>testing</b> the engine in a boat on Long Island Sound, but lost control and capsized, sending the engine to the bottom.|$|E

Discovery rejected the proposal initially because they had just commissioned a series on the same topic.

Jamie Hyneman {{was one of a}} number of special effects artists who were asked to prepare a casting video for network consideration. Rees had interviewed him previously for a segment of the popular science series Beyond 2000 about the British/American robot combat television series Robot Wars. Adam Savage, who had worked with Hyneman in commercials and on the robot combat television series BattleBots, was asked by Hyneman to help co-host the show because, according to Savage, Hyneman thought himself too uninteresting to host the series on his own.|$|E
25|$|Nine inscribed copper plates {{thought to}} belong to the mature Harappan phase (2600 - 1900 BCE), are thought to be used for printing. The Indus {{characters}} in the plates are mirrored, and the loss in groove definition indicates repeated cleaning and polishing of the surface. The plates are also significantly larger than any seal, and much thicker, the thickness thought to help support pressure applied to their surface. The large nature of the plates makes them an unlikely candidate for seals as the tablets thus produced would be prone to breakage. The metal composition of the plates were characteristic for that period and location, and showed significant corrosion, indicating its ancient nature. Continuing patination {{across the surface of the}} plate, including on the lines, indicates that the marks were not made recently on an ancient piece of metal. <b>On</b> <b>testing</b> the plates for printing using two kinds of ink (water and oil based) onto rag paper, silk and parchment, the results on all three materials were found to be of remarkable quality. All these suggest that these plates point to the first known examples of printing in the world.
