40|$|The {{mounting}} evidence {{on climate change}} has thrust the sustainability issue {{to the forefront of}} many political agendas. Current research has provided many business cases for sustainable design and construction. While commercial green buildings have been the mainstay, the green phenomenon has also spread to educational facilities. This paper provides a case study of the new Mirvac School of Sustainable Development Building at Bond University, Gold Coast, Australia. With its extensive green features, it is applying to be the first six-star rated green educational building in Australia. To this end, the management of green buildings will be a challenge for asset managers. In particular, this paper focuses on the challenge of harmonising the social-environmental goal of sustainability and recommends a strategy for gaining <b>occupant</b> <b>support</b> and acceptance of green facilities...|$|E

Materials management looks at the planning and design considerations needed to support the efficient delivery and removal of goods and services that <b>support</b> <b>occupant</b> activity. The streams of occupant-generated materials and activity include mail, office supplies, lab supplies, food, special deliveries, custodial services, building supplies, waste and recycling, and service calls.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the rapid}} growth of the {{domestic}} photovoltaic (PV) sector in the UK all involved are at an early learning stage in terms of implementation. Investors typically rely on national standards and guidance when developing specifications that define PV system components. However, PV technology performance is promoted and reported solely in terms of cost and energy efficiency goals, without holistic consideration of other contributing factors such occupants’ ability to effectively manage PV systems to reduce the peak demand issue linked with PV systems in the UK. This paper examines policy, design, installation, handover and use of domestic PV systems. An in-depth case study of 20 households in a new-build UK development demonstrates the challenges related to introducing PV systems in housing. Key findings identify the need for complete rather than partial design team involvement and capacity building for inexperienced residents as well as building industry actors. PV systems are perceived by policy makers and industry as requiring very limited occupant interaction with limited potential to impact on energy use practices—thus an integrated PV system learning process incorporating occupant feedback is disregarded. Poor individual <b>occupant</b> learning <b>support</b> and PV system feedback onsite makes this learning difficult...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHumans {{live and}} spent their times in buildings. Determining the best {{configuration}} for their office or apartment (HVAC configuration, {{doors and windows}} positions, usage of appliances, [...] .) is becoming subtle because low consumption buildings {{are becoming more and}} more sensitive to human behavior. Moreover, variable energy costs and energy availability issues increase the complexity of the energy management problem. In such complex situations, many scientific research and engineering works are ongoing with the aim of <b>supporting</b> <b>occupants</b> in their everyday life, but still, in most cases, there is a need for experts to design models for living zones to manage, which is time-consuming and very costly. This paper will continue in the stream to help occupants to understand their energy systems and the impact of their actions on the system, by providing causal explanations and presenting a path diagram for all actions and environmental changes and their consequences...|$|R
40|$|Smart homes {{monitor the}} {{behaviour}} of the <b>occupant</b> and provide <b>support</b> in an autonomous fashion by activating support devices. To ensure it {{is suitable for}} elderly people, {{there is a need}} for purpose-designed equipment based on an understanding of user needs. Even people with dementia can be assisted if the new technology does not require complex interactions with the user. The house can provide support with automatic lighting, support in the kitchen and bathroom, provide memory support and help reduce wandering with people with dementia, with the aim of improving the occupants' independence and quality of life. Key elements of the technology are prompting and reminding devices, mainly using recorded voice messages. To be effective, the technology requires an external infrastructure to provide assessment, technical backup and monitoring. Evaluations of installations are looking very promising, although of course it can never replace personal human care, only augment it...|$|R
40|$|As we enable {{everyday}} environments with ubiquitous technology, {{there are}} many opportunities to support simple activities in useful ways.

40|$|U. S. {{buildings}} {{are a significant}} source of energy consumption (about 50 %) and carbon emissions (about 40 %), and providing conditioning to building interiors is a major portion of that expenditure. Improving building envelope performance can reduce the amount of energy used for heating and cooling, since external walls provide an important barrier between occupied building spaces and variable ambient conditions. In general, multi-layer exterior walls tend to perform better than single-layer walls, even for the same overall R-value and thermal capacitance. This work addresses practical choices in multi-layer wall design to minimize internal temperature swings that result from outside, or ambient, temperature fluctuations. An electrical analogy is used to model one-dimensional heat conduction using RC circuits. A frequency response analysis is conducted based on a period of one day. For a fixed wall thickness, four features are optimized: materials, proportion of materials, number of layers, and material distribution. Key design features include pairing insulating and thermally massive materials, distributing layers evenly, and positioning the insulating layers at the inner- and outer-most layers of the wall (i. e., near the indoor and outdoor environments). Methods for determining the optimal proportion of each material and number of layers are also presented. Combined, these easily implemented features can reduce interior temperature fluctuations by several orders of magnitude compared to ambient temperature variations. This helps maintain steady indoor temperatures, which is more comfortable for building <b>occupants,</b> and <b>supports</b> energy management strategies, like reducing peak heating and cooling loads...|$|R

In the theoretical part I am concerned with defining of the notion displaced person. The St Paul´s House occupants are mostly individuals in an oppressive social situaton {{who have lost their}} homes or lodging. The following chapters map out the life-strategy reasons of the individuals without home, touch the source of origin of the fastidious situation and of the connected mechanism used by the individuals on the streets for surpassing or lessening the impacts of their actual situation. In the practical part I am dealing with description of particular services in the St Paul´s House and with the characteristics of its occupants. The St Paul´s House is a non-state unprofitable organization, which goal is to provide the social services for the individuals in anoppressive situaton, namely to the individuals without home or shelter. As a constituent of the practical part there is a research. It deals with the problems of employment of the St Paul´s House occupants, namely with the variety of the job chosen by the occupants. The problems the St Paul´s House occupants have to encounter are frequently very complicated, the <b>occupant</b> is <b>supported</b> to a self-dependent solution and the result is closely associated with the steps which the individual performs for his survival...|$|R
50|$|On 9 April 1940, Norway {{had been}} invaded by Germany {{as a part}} of World War II. The ruling cabinet Nygaardsvold and the Royal Family fled the capital Oslo, and Fascist {{politician}} Vidkun Quisling took advantage of the situation to perform a coup d'etat. However, this was highly unpopular among the Norwegian people, and the newly arrived German <b>occupants</b> did not <b>support</b> such a government either. The Supreme Court of Norway, with support by directors in business life and civil administration, were given the green light by German envoy Curt Bräuer to establish the so-called Administrative Council. On 3 May 1940, the Administrative Council established the Committee for Industry and Trade (Nemnda for industri og omsetning), to maintain industrial production in Norway throughout the hardships of the war. Conrad Wilhelm Eger had a central role in this committee, together with Carl Bøyesen, Einar Schjelderup, Elias Volan and chairman Einar Sunde. Eger was also a member of a committee which reviewed the potential for building more aluminium plants.|$|R

At Power’s Elbow tells their story for the first time, uncovering the truth behind three centuries’ worth of prime ministers and their aides. Its subjects range from the early media-managers and election-fixers of Sir Robert Walpole, to the teams supporting the wartime premierships of David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill, to the semi-official ‘Department of the Prime Minister’ established under Tony Blair. Along the way, Andrew Blick and George Jones demonstrate how these essential advisers can be a source of both solace and strife to their chiefs, solving and causing problems in almost equal measure. Above all, they reveal how a Prime Minister’s approach to his staff can define his premiership, for better or for worse...|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Construction Innovation [© Emerald]. The definitive version is available at: www. emeraldinsight. com/ 10. 1108 / 14714170910931525 Purpose – Offsite {{is one of the main}} innovative techniques employed in the contemporary UK construction sector. Building maintenance accounts for over 5 percent of the UK's gross domestic product of which bathrooms are regarded as a critical area, with potential high risks and defects. However, the importance of its maintenance has been largely underestimated and research into this area appears to be limited. This paper aims to address this knowledge gap by investigating the maintenance performance of offsite and in situ bathrooms for student accommodation. Design/methodology/approach – The paper examines 732 maintenance records over three years of 216 precast concrete modules, 84 Glass Reinforced Polyester (GRP) modules and 96 traditionally-built in situ bathrooms. Findings – The research found that offsite modules outperformed in situ bathrooms in terms of maintenance. GRP modules created the least maintenance problems, compared to precast modules and in situ bathrooms. The maintenance of in situ bathrooms was more complex than offsite modules, and involved more diverse problematic areas. The main causes of the problems included inappropriate design; poor build workmanship, lack of quality of component materials and improper usage by <b>occupants.</b> This <b>supports</b> a parallel study that found that the costs associated with maintenance were significantly higher for in situ bathrooms than for the equivalent offsite solutions. Research limitations/implications – The paper contributes to understanding the problems of offsite bathroom modules requiring maintenance in comparison with in situ bathrooms and their possible causes. Key aspects of offsite bathrooms including drainage, toilets, vents and sinks should be improved. Quality of component materials used for in situ bathrooms should be ensured. These improvements can only be achieved through better design for maintenance with clients' aspiration embodied. The findings should assist in design decision making of selecting bathrooms for residential buildings. However, a balanced approach, taking into account other factors for such selection, is open for future investigation. Originality/value – The framework of strategies developed should improve the innovative design of bathrooms manufactured offsite and help maintain them for better lifecycle performance...|$|R
40|$|Climate {{change and}} the {{concomitant}} need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through living sustainably is possibly the most significant issue of our time. Sustainable built environments {{have the potential to}} make a significant contribution to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The success of sustainable architecture relies on both technology and its acceptance by building occupants. Whilst most research on sustainable architecture has focussed on technology, there has been less research on occupant experience of sustainable buildings. This research addresses this gap by investigating occupant experience of sustainable architecture through a case study and a review of literature relating to the phenomenological experience of architecture. The case study is the School of Architecture and Design at the University of Tasmania. The research design is based on mixed methodology, using questionnaire surveys to provide extensive quantitative data which is investigated more intensively through the qualitative research methods of interviews and focus groups. The results show strong dissatisfaction with most of the specific variables of comfort (temperature, air, noise, lighting, personal control), satisfaction with overall comfort, health and productivity and strong satisfaction with overall design aspects. This finding is consistent with the literature on comfort and occupant experience of green buildings. It appears that occupants in the case study building are adapting to the discomfort they experience, with the satisfaction they express for overall comfort and the building overall indicating tolerance and forgiveness of this discomfort. The analysis and discussion is structured thematically around the themes of comfort, delight and forgiveness, as these arose as the main issues from the data and have significance for the development of sustainable architecture. The internal environments of sustainable buildings are often more variable, less predictable and have a greater temperature range than air conditioned buildings, due to the use of passive technologies for heating, cooling and ventilation which more closely follow the external climate. Forgiveness of these less‐than‐static conditions is a positive step in the acceptance of sustainable architecture and can bring the benefit of thermal delight. The literature indicates that good design which encourages delight can {{have a positive effect on}} occupant well‐being which in turn may facilitate forgiveness. A phenomenological understanding of <b>occupant</b> experience <b>supports</b> the concept of comfort as a multi‐dimensional relationship between occupant and building. For centuries architects have been guided by the Vitruvian triad of Firmness, Commodity and Delight in their pursuit of architectural excellence. I propose that this is augmented by the triad of Forgiveness, Comfort and Delight to guide architects towards creating sustainable architecture for the twenty first century...|$|R
40|$|This study {{addresses}} two {{energy efficiency}} approaches to renovation of multi-family housing in Sweden aiming {{at a better}} understanding of robustness as a building characteristic especially in terms of energy performance of buildings and indoor air quality (IAQ). Robustness could be generally defined as the characteristic of measures by which the building or the system lives up to its design purpose in a real life situation. The performance of some systems in operational situation {{is not the same as}} their expected performance during the design phase. This could be caused by poor assumptions during modeling or disregarding users’ behavior. In case of energy efficient buildings such misestimation can result in vulnerable measures which would affect energy objectives of the design. Thus, to achieve sustainable architecture especially in a long-term perspective, applying more robust measures would eliminate vulnerability of design to future changes and enhance durability and reliability of building. Solar houses in Gårdsten and passive houses in Brogården have been chosen as two different approaches to renova-tion of multi-family housing with energy efficiency (EE) objectives. The two cases have been analyzed using an analyti-cal framework which has been developed based on the findings of this study to assess the robustness of applied EE measures. Adaptability, Redundancy, preference for passive techniques, users control over IAQ, transparency of systems to users and maintenance facility have been considered as the main criteria for robustness analysis and the performance of cases has been studied in relation to major factors likely to face uncertainties such as household appliances, <b>occupant</b> behavior, maintenance <b>support,</b> energy sources, technical systems, envelope quality and climatic conditions...|$|R
40|$|Smart environments {{feature a}} number of {{computing}} and sensing devices that <b>support</b> <b>occupants</b> in performing their tasks. In the last decades {{there has been a}} multitude of advances in miniaturizing sensors and computers, while greatly increasing their performance. As a result new devices are introduced into our daily lives that have a plethora of functions. Gathering information about the occupants is fundamental in adapting the smart environment according to preference and situation. There is a large number of different sensing devices available that can provide information about the user. They include cameras, accelerometers, GPS, acoustic systems, or capacitive sensors. The latter use the properties of an electric field to sense presence and properties of conductive objects within range. They are commonly employed in finger-controlled touch screens that are present in billions of devices. A less common variety is the capacitive proximity sensor. It can detect the presence of the human body over a distance, providing interesting applications in smart environments. Choosing the right sensor technology is an important decision in designing a smart environment application. Apart from looking at previous use cases, this process can be supported by providing more formal methods. In this work I present a benchmarking model that is designed to support this decision process for applications in smart environments. Previous benchmarks for pervasive systems have been adapted towards sensors systems and include metrics that are specific for smart environments. Based on distinct sensor characteristics, different ratings are used as weighting factors in calculating a benchmarking score. The method is verified using popularity matching in two scientific databases. Additionally, there are extensions to cope with central tendency bias and normalization with regards to average feature rating. Four relevant application areas are identified by applying this benchmark to applications in smart environments and capacitive proximity sensors. They are indoor localization, smart appliances, physiological sensing and gesture interaction. Any application area has a set of challenges regarding the required sensor technology, layout of the systems, and processing that can be tackled using various new or improved methods. I will present a collection of existing and novel methods that support processing data generated by capacitive proximity sensors. These are in the areas of sparsely distributed sensors, model-driven fitting methods, heterogeneous sensor systems, image-based processing and physiological signal processing. To evaluate the feasibility of these methods, several prototypes have been created and tested for performance and usability. Six of them are presented in detail. Based on these evaluations and the knowledge generated in the design process, I am able to classify capacitive proximity sensing in smart environments. This classification consists of a comparison to other popular sensing technologies in smart environments, the major benefits of capacitive proximity sensors, and their limitations. In order to support parties interested in developing smart environment applications using capacitive proximity sensors, I present a set of guidelines that support the decision process from technology selection to choice of processing methods...|$|R
