25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2011, the {{district}} applied for and was awarded over $3 million in School Improvement grants. Four of the district's schools were eligible for funding due to poor student achievement, including Mosser ES, Sheridan ES, and Union Terrace ES. The grant stipulates the funds be used for improving student achievement using one of four federally dictated strategies. The strategies are: transformation, turnaround, restart with new faculty and administration or closure of failing schools. Allentown School District schools received funding for transformation of South Middleton Middle School. Transformation calls {{for a change in}} faculty and administration evaluations, mandated training in proven teaching techniques and rigorous curriculum change that focuses <b>on</b> <b>student</b> <b>achievement.</b>|$|E

25|$|Klonsky {{became one}} of the leaders of the modern small schools {{movement}} which has done much to transform the face of secondary school education in the United State. His academic work focused on small school size as a solution to the problems of inner city schools; his early research on issues of school size and its impact <b>on</b> <b>student</b> <b>achievement,</b> school violence, and dropout rates, helped pave the way towards the development of thousands of new small and charter schools across the country. By 1996, he was the director of the Small Schools Workshop at the University of Illinois, Chicago, and in 1999, he was named by president Bill Clinton to the Academic Advisory Council of the National Campaign Against Youth Violence, where he advocated small schools as a mechanism for violence reduction. Klonsky is now a retired professor of education after teaching at several universities, including UIC and the Fischler School of Education at Nova Southeastern University.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, Dover Area School District {{agreed to}} {{participate}} in a pilot program to develop a new way to evaluate teachers that, in part, takes into account student achievement. Several other York County school districts also participated. The pilot program had 104 K-12 entities, including: nine career and technical centers, nine charter schools and nine intermediate units. Beginning in January 2012, York County some schools will use the new evaluation method and provide feedback to the Department of Education. This new evaluation will not be used to determine an educator’s official 2011-12 assessment. Under the new evaluation system, 50% of the evaluation of a teacher will be based on an observation divided into four categories: planning and preparation, classroom environment, instruction, and professional responsibilities. The other half will be based <b>on</b> <b>student</b> <b>achievement</b> (15 percent will be building-level data, 15 percent will be teacher-specific data, and 20 percent will be elective). The new evaluation system has both announced and unannounced observations. The system includes meetings between the teacher and evaluator before and after the direct observation of a lesson.|$|E

2500|$|The {{general idea}} of value added {{modeling}} {{has also been}} extended to consider principals and school leaders. [...] While there has been considerable anecdotal discussion {{about the importance of}} school leaders, there has been very little systematic research into the impact of them on student outcomes. [...] Recent analysis in Texas has provided evidence about the effectiveness of leaders by looking at how the gains in student achievement for a school change after the principal changes. [...] This outcome-based approach to measuring effectiveness of principals is very similar to the value-added modeling that has been applied to the evaluation of teachers. [...] The early research in Texas finds that principals have a very large impact <b>on</b> <b>student</b> <b>achievement.</b> [...] Conservative estimates indicate that an effective school leader improves the performance of all students in a school, with the magnitude equal on average to two months additional learning gains for the students in each school year. [...] These gains come at least in part through the principal's impact on selecting and retaining good teachers. [...] Ineffective principals, however, have a similarly large negative effect on school performance, suggesting that issues of evaluation are as important with respect to school leadership as they are for teachers.|$|E
