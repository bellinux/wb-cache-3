He studied authentic costumes and armaments {{from the time}} of the uprising, visited Takovo and sketched the church and large tree under which Obrenović led the people to revolt. Jovanović also studied the facial features of locals and sketched them, and so some <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces</b> appear in the painting. Jovanović painted The Takovo Uprising in Paris over the course of several months in 1894. It was first exhibited the following year at his brother Milan's photography studio in Belgrade, not far from King Alexander's residence, the Old Palace. The exhibition coincided with the uprising's 80th anniversary.|$|E

5|$|Most of the non-player {{characters}} (NPCs) that {{inhabit the}} open world were motion captured. The developers contacted casting agencies, and asked {{their friends and}} families if {{they would like to}} appear as extras in the game. Over 75 people were scanned in a three-day period. They were seated in chairs and told not to move or smile, and a high-definition digital camera captured a 3D model <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces.</b> The camera sent out strobe light patterns to capture the volume and shape of each face. A 360-degree setup captured the actors' moving bodies, but mannequins were also used to help capture different clothing styles. Data collected from the cameras was used by the designers to render digital models, each composed of roughly 1.4 million polygons—any blank spots on the models would be digitally filled in by the designers. To render the models in the game, the data would be compressed by reducing the polygon count.|$|E

5|$|He and {{his brother}} Jonathan were sent to Le Mans Military Academy in Rolling Prairie, Indiana, after Jackson was {{diagnosed}} as hyperactive. He was often paddled for disciplinary reasons during his time as a cadet. Jackson repeated ninth grade and was suspended from school twice. He was an all-state running back on his football team {{in high school and}} was featured in the February 1984 issue of Sports Illustrated as part <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>Faces</b> in the Crowd section, which noted him for his 15touchdowns, 889rushing yards, and 7.2yards per carry in six games. Jackson enrolled in North Carolina A University, his father's alma mater, earning his Bachelor of Science degree magna cum laude in 1987. He decided to follow his father's advice to receive a seminary education at the Chicago Theological Seminary, where he earned his master's degree a year early but opted not to become ordained. Jackson proceeded to law school at the University of Illinois and convinced his future wife to transfer there from the Georgetown University Law Center. He then earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) from the University of Illinois College of Law in 1993. Jackson never sat for the bar exam despite finishing his coursework a semester early.|$|E

25|$|To further {{enhance the}} desired pale complexion, women layered white make-up on their faces. This make-up, called Ceruse, {{was made up}} of white lead and vinegar. Women wearing ceruse {{achieved}} the white face, however, the white lead that was used to make it is poisonous. Women in this time often contracted lead poisoning which resulted in deaths before the age of 50. Other ingredients used as make-up were sulfur, alum, and tin ash. In addition to using make-up to achieve the pale complexion, women in this era were bled to take the color out <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces.</b>|$|E
25|$|Gurney {{was educated}} at Macquarie Street State School, where his prowess {{with a pencil}} soon became evident, regaling his classmates with caricatures <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces</b> perched atop incongruous bodies. Leaving school at age 13, he found {{employment}} at an ironmonger's shop, followed {{by a couple of}} other jobs, before embarking on an electrical apprenticeship with the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission, in the expectation of becoming an electrical engineer. This entailed taking night classes at Hobart Technical College, but it was not long before his attention was drawn to art classes conducted at the same institution by Lucien Dechaineux (1869–1957).|$|E

After the opponents are introduced, a short video is shown, detailing the history and the accomplishments of Kansas basketball. As the Jayhawks are introduced, the students rip up their newspapers and throw the confetti pieces of paper in the air as celebration.

25|$|Malayan tapirs {{have very}} poor eyesight, making them rely greatly on their {{excellent}} {{sense of smell}} and hearing to go about in their everyday lives. They have small, beady eyes with brown irises on either side <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces.</b> Their eyes are often covered in a blue haze, which is corneal cloudiness thought {{to be caused by}} repetitive exposure to light. Corneal cloudiness is when the cornea starts to lose its transparency. The cornea is necessary for the transmitting and focusing of outside light as it enters the eye, and cloudiness can cause vision loss. This causes the Malayan tapir to have very inadequate vision, both on land and in water, where they spend the majority of their time. Also, as these tapirs are most active at night and since they have poor eyesight, it is harder for them to search for food and avoid predators in the dark.|$|E
500|$|In a bid {{to involve}} their fans for This Is War, Thirty Seconds to Mars held an event, called The Summit, at the Avalon Club in Los Angeles, where they invited fans to provide backing vocals and percussion. After {{the success of the}} initial Summit, the group {{repeated}} the event in eight countries and extended it digitally. The band also invited fans to submit close-up shots <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces</b> in order to make 2,000 different individual covers for the album. Leto described This Is War as a record about survival: [...] "It was a two-year creative battle that was ferocious and tough but creatively rewarding, and all of those adverse elements, in hindsight, made us stronger and made the record stronger." ...|$|E
500|$|The team {{spent a lot}} of {{resources}} in carrying out detailed motion capture, to enhance players' engagement with the story and make it easier for them to form emotional attachments to characters, and to keep the game and the TV show consistent with each other. They also hoped that use of this technology would add realism to the game and prevent players from getting distracted by the characters' unrealistic behaviors and appearances. Lake added that one of the challenges when recording motion capture is to convince the inexperienced actors, who thought that the system lacked complexity, not to overact. According to Lake, the game features a technology that creates realistic digital counterparts of the characters and records every little detail <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces.</b> The team initially did the recording at Los Angeles, where actors need to wear spandex suits with tracking marks and head cameras. Remedy invited the actors to Remedy's office in Helsinki, where they used their own technology to carry out extremely detailed motion capturing of facial expressions and movements in dialogue. Ashmore described the chamber for motion capturing as a [...] "Sweat Box", as actors must remain steady, moving only their faces, in order to prevent the motion capture data from getting ruined.|$|E

500|$|The Ad Council {{claimed the}} poster was {{developed}} in 1942 by its precursor, the War Advertising Committee, {{as part of a}} [...] "Women in War Jobs" [...] campaign, helping to bring [...] "over two million women" [...] into war production. In February 2012 during the Ad Council's 70th anniversary celebration, an interactive application designed by Animax's HelpsGood digital agency was linked to the Ad Council's Facebook page. The Facebook app was called [...] "Rosify Yourself", referring to Rosie the Riveter; it allowed viewers to upload images <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>faces</b> to be incorporated into the [...] "We Can Do It!" [...] poster, then saved to be shared with friends. Ad Council President and CEO Peggy Conlon posted her own [...] "Rosified" [...] face on Huffington Post in an article she wrote about the group's 70-year history. The staff of the television show Today posted two [...] "Rosified" [...] images on their website, using the faces of news anchors Matt Lauer and Ann Curry. However, Seton Hall University professor James J. Kimble and University of Pittsburgh professor Lester C. Olson researched the origins of the poster and determined that it was not produced by the Ad Council nor was it used for recruiting women workers.|$|E
