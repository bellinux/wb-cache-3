25|$|Chronic {{bronchitis}} {{is defined}} as a productive cough that lasts for three months <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>per</b> year for at least two years. Most people with chronic bronchitis have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Tobacco smoking is the most common cause, with a number of other factors such as air pollution and genetics playing a smaller role. Treatments include quitting smoking, vaccinations, rehabilitation, and often inhaled bronchodilators and steroids. Some people may benefit from long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation.|$|E
25|$|There is {{increasing}} {{evidence that the}} majority of spontaneously arising mutations are due to error-prone replication (translesion synthesis) past DNA damage in the template strand. Naturally occurring oxidative DNA damages arise at least 10,000 times per cell per day in humans and 50,000 times <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>per</b> cell per day in rats.

Hazelwood Park has an educated population with over 40% of the population holding a degree or diploma.

25|$|In Punjab the {{consumption}} of fertiliser per hectare is 223.46kg as compared to 90kg nationally. The state has been awarded the National Productivity Award for agriculture extension services for ten years, from 1991–92 to 1998–99 and from 2001 to 2003–04. In recent years a drop in productivity has been observed, mainly due to falling fertility of the soil. This {{is believed to be}} due to excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides over the years. Another worry is the rapidly falling water table on which almost 90% of the agriculture depends; alarming drops have been witnessed in recent years.

25|$|Silk {{and cotton}} were {{imported}} to Rome from China and India. As {{early as the}} 3rd century BC silk was being purchased by Roman traders from the Carthaginian ports of Tyre and Beirut, where it was woven and dyed after arriving from the far East. As Roman weaving techniques developed, silk yarn was used to make geometrically or freely figured damask, tabbies and tapestry. Some of these silk fabrics were extremely fine - around 50 threads <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>per</b> centimeter. Production of such highly decorative, costly fabrics {{seems to have been}} a speciality of weavers in the eastern Roman provinces, where the earliest Roman horizontal looms were developed.|$|E
25|$|Elaine Tuttle Hansen {{was elected}} {{as the first}} female {{president}} of Bates College and managed the second largest capital campaign ever undertaken by Bates, totaling at $120 million and lead the endowment through the 2007-08 financial crisis. The college announced her retirement in 2011, appointing Nancy Cable as interim president, to serve through June 30, 2012, while the college conducted a national search for its eighth president. In 2011, Bates made national headlines for being named the most expensive university in the U.S., which caused backlash from American academia and students as it in-directly highlighted substantial socioeconomic inequality among students. After a year-long search for the next president, Harvard University dean, Clayton Spencer, was appointed as Hansen's successor. Spencer assumed the presidency in 2012, and created diversity mandates, expanded student and faculty recruitment, and financial aid allocation. While some reforms were successful, minorities at the college, typically classified as non-white and low income students, still reported lack of safe spaces, insensitive professors, financial insecurity, indirect racism and social elitism. According to a 2017 article on income inequality by The New York Times, 18% of Bates students came from the 1% of the American upper class (families who made about $525,000 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>per</b> year), {{with more than half}} coming from the top 5% (families who made about $110,000 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>per</b> year). In October 2016, the college announced the construction of new facilities, residential dorms (Chu and Kalperis Hall), and the development new areas of study.|$|E
25|$|In 2001 the United States State Department {{estimated}} that 50,000 to 100,000 {{women and girls}} are trafficked each year into the United States.

The June 2004 report estimated the total trafficked annually at between 14,500 and 17,500. The Bush administration set up 42 Justice Department task forces and spent more than $150 million on attempts to reduce human trafficking. However, in the seven years since the law was passed, the administration has identified only 1,362 victims of human trafficking brought into the United States since 2000, nowhere near the 50,000 <b>or</b> <b>more</b> <b>per</b> year the government had estimated.|$|E
