5|$|Episode Two {{gameplay}} {{consists of}} expansive environments, travel and reduced linear play, continuing Valve's policy of orienting each episode around a particular theme <b>or</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> technologies. Following the closing events of Episode One, it sees Gordon Freeman and the series' other major characters {{moving away from}} City 17 to the surrounding countryside.|$|E
5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea <b>or</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E
5|$|Hidden Markov {{models are}} {{probabilistic}} models that can assign likelihoods to all possible combinations of gaps, matches, and mismatches {{to determine the}} most likely MSA <b>or</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> possible MSAs. HMMs can produce a single highest-scoring output but can also generate a family of possible alignments that can then be evaluated for biological significance. HMMs can produce both global and local alignments. Although HMM-based methods have been developed relatively recently, they offer significant improvements in computational speed, especially for sequences that contain overlapping regions.|$|E

5|$|Public {{sociology}} {{refers to}} an approach to the discipline which seeks to transcend the academy in order to engage with wider audiences. It is perhaps best understood as a style of sociology rather than a particular method, theory, <b>or</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> political values. This approach is primarily associated with Michael Burawoy who contrasted it with professional sociology, a form of academic sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other professional sociologists. Public sociology {{is also part of}} the broader field of science communication or science journalism. In a distinct but similar vein, applied sociology, also known as clinical sociology, policy sociology or sociological practice, applies knowledge derived from sociological research to solve societal problems.|$|E
5|$|Animaniacs {{had a large}} cast of characters, {{separated}} into individual segments, with each pair <b>or</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> characters acting in its own plot. The Warners, Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, were three cartoon stars from the 1930s that were locked away in the Warner Bros. water tower until the 1990s, when they escaped. After their escape, they often interacted with Warner Bros. studio workers, including Ralph the Security Guard; Dr. Otto Scratchansniff, the studio psychiatrist, and his assistant Hello Nurse. Pinky and the Brain are two genetically altered laboratory mice who continuously plot and attempt {{to take over the}} world. Slappy Squirrel is an octogenarian cartoon star who can easily outwit antagonists and uses her wiles to educate her nephew, Skippy Squirrel, about cartoon techniques. Additional principal characters included Rita and Runt, Buttons and Mindy, Chicken Boo, Flavio and Marita (The Hip Hippos), Katie Ka-Boom, and a trio of pigeons known as The Goodfeathers.|$|E
5|$|Players {{assume control}} of Jeremy, a sword-wielding, melee-focused character, and Alysa, who uses {{crossbows}} to deliver ranged attacks. The game {{can be played}} as a single player game, in which the player alternates between controlling Jeremy and Alysa, or as a local co-op game, in which two players play cooperatively, with one controlling each character. Blood Knights does not support online co-op. Like most hack and slash games, the control scheme is minimal. When controlling Jeremy, players can chain attacks using one button (the X button on the Xbox 360), and can use a number of special attacks that have a cooldown timer, including a heavy blow, a whirlwind attack, and a power that draws distant enemies to Jeremy. While controlling Alysa, the game functions as a twin-stick shooter, in which movement is controlled by one thumbstick <b>or</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> keys, and firing weapons {{is controlled by the}} other thumbstick or another set of keys. Alysa also has special attacks, including the ability to fire flaming arrows and a grenade attack. In single player gameplay, the player can switch between Jeremy and Alysa by pressing a button (the Y button on the Xbox 360). Players can transfer health, in the form of blood, between the two playable characters, healing one {{at the expense of the}} other.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} home-based drug 'recipes' which could, and likely do, result in users injecting highly impure, dangerous, and toxic chemicals, causing krokodil symptoms. Although drawing {{attention}} {{to the dangers of}} trying to produce or alter drugs using kitchen chemistry and internet 'recipes' is important and valuable, it is unproven—and highly unlikely—that krokodil is a single drug, but rather a symptom, <b>or</b> <b>set</b> <b>of</b> symptoms, of injecting non-psychoactive solvents, reactants, etc.|$|E
