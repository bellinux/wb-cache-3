5|$|Special {{consideration}} {{was given}} during filming {{to allow for}} integration of the planned special effects. Television monitors standing in for computer displays were specially calibrated so that their refresh rate {{did not result in}} banding on film. Due to a loss <b>of</b> <b>resolution</b> and quality resulting from rephotographing an element in an optical printer, live action sequences for effects were shot in 65mm or VistaVision formats to compensate. When the larger prints were reduced through an anamorphic lens on the printer, the result was a Panavision composite.|$|E
5|$|The lyrics' {{reference}} {{to an extreme}} length of time is accentuated by the stretching out of an already slow 6/8 metre into 9/8, and, during the verses, by the appending of a measure-long instrumental tag after each two bars of vocal melody. Partly {{as a result of}} the absence <b>of</b> <b>resolution</b> in the home key, the descending bassline in the verses – a 4-3-2-1 sequence of notes mirroring the IV-iii-ii-I chord pattern – establishes an almost subliminal tonic.|$|E
5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better {{binocular}} vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 times better than humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit <b>of</b> <b>resolution</b> for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no direct}} {{replacement}} to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope, because near-term space telescopes {{do not duplicate}} Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths), instead concentrating on the farther infrared bands. These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and farther away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying {{the expense of a}} space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms <b>of</b> <b>resolution</b> by using adaptive optics (AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space.|$|E
5|$|Two {{regions of}} smooth plains were {{observed}} by Voyager 2. They generally have low relief and have far fewer craters {{than in the}} cratered terrains, indicating a relatively young surface age. In one of the smooth plain regions, Sarandib Planitia, no impact craters were visible down to the limit <b>of</b> <b>resolution.</b> Another region of smooth plains to the southwest of Sarandib is criss-crossed by several troughs and scarps. Cassini has since viewed these smooth plains regions, like Sarandib Planitia and Diyar Planitia at much higher resolution. Cassini images show these regions filled with low-relief ridges and fractures, probably caused by shear deformation. The high-resolution images of Sarandib Planitia revealed {{a number of small}} impact craters, which allow for an estimate of the surface age, either 170 million years or 3.7 billion years, depending on assumed impactor population.|$|E

60|$|As {{introductory}} {{to these}} interrogatories which Judge Douglas propounded {{to me at}} Ottawa, he read a set <b>of</b> <b>resolutions</b> which he said Judge Trumbull and myself had participated in adopting, in the first Republican State Convention, held at Springfield in October, 1854. He insisted that I and Judge Trumbull, and perhaps the entire Republican party, {{were responsible for the}} doctrines contained in the set <b>of</b> <b>resolutions</b> which he read, and I understand that it was from that set <b>of</b> <b>resolutions</b> that he deduced the interrogatories which he propounded to me, using these resolutions as a sort of authority for propounding those questions to me. Now, I say here to-day that I do not answer his interrogatories because of their springing at all from that set <b>of</b> <b>resolutions</b> which he read. I answered them because Judge Douglas thought fit to ask them. I do not now, nor ever did, recognize any responsibility upon myself in that set <b>of</b> <b>resolutions.</b> When I replied to him on that occasion, I assured him that I never {{had anything to do with}} them. I repeat here to today that I never in any possible form had anything to do with that set <b>of</b> <b>resolutions</b> It turns out, I believe, that those resolutions were never passed in any convention held in Springfield.|$|R
