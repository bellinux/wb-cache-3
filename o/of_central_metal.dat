Formation of this nano-composite was confirmed by infrared (IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of SWCNT- 18, complexes 13 - 15, and 20 were electropolymerized on glassy carbon electrodes (GCE). Complex 14 was also electrodeposited on GCE. Surface properties of the SAMs were consistent with the molecular feature of the substituent and the nature <b>of</b> <b>central</b> <b>metal</b> in the adsorbed species, while those of the MnPc modified GCEs were dependent on point of substitution and number of substituent. The SAM-modified gold electrodes were used for the electrocatalytic oxidation of the carbamate insecticide, carbofuran.

There was enhanced sensitivity (attributed to the presence of SWCNT) of the SWCNT- 18 -SAM-modified gold electrode towards carbofuran, relative to the signals observed on the other SAMs. Current response of the insecticide,bendiocarb, was also intensified, at more favorable oxidation potentials, on the MnPc (14 and 17) modified GCEs, relative to the response on bare GCE, substantiating electrocatalysis. Also, catalysis of the oxidation of the herbicide, bentazon, was observed on polymeric film of complex 20.

All the compounds behaved as ambiodic corrosion inhibitors for mild steel and were considered to inhibit the corrosion by getting adsorbed on the surface. The inhibition efficiencies (IEs) of the complexes, in general, were found to be appreciably higher than those of corresponding ligands. However, the IE values of the complexes of molybdenum and tungsten of the same ligand did not differ much in their magnitude indicating thereby that the nature <b>of</b> <b>central</b> <b>metal</b> ions hardly influenced the inhibition efficiency. The slight difference in the IEs of the complexes at a given concentration seems to be caused by the slight difference in their size.

In order to study the correlation between macrocycle nonplanarity and physicochemical properties in detail, a series of six porphyrins with graded degree of macrocycle distortion was investigated. These conformationally designed porphyrins are based on the successive introduction of ?-ethyl groups into the tetraphenylporphyrin parent macrocycle and the degree of nonplanarity is dependent on the number and localization of the ?-ethyl meso-phenyl interactions. The electronic properties of the complete series of porphyrins were investigated in solution. It was found that the singlet and triplet properties depend not only on the out-of-plane distortion parameter but also on the type <b>of</b> <b>central</b> <b>metal.</b> Moreover, it was found that macrocycle distortion affects the singlet state properties significantly stronger than the triplet properties. In addition, the efficiency of energy transfer to molecular oxygen was investigated.

Mercaptocarboxylic acid stabilized CdTe quantum dots (QDs) {{were used as}} energy donors to anionic water-soluble MPcs through Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET). Energy transfer (ET) from the QDs to the MPcs occurred upon photoexcitation of the QDs. An enhancement in efficiency of ET {{with the nature of}} the cappings on the QDs was observed with few occurrences of a non-Förster type ET. QDs were found to improve the photophysicochemical behaviour of the MPcs, with the possibility of indirect production of singlet oxygen (Φ[subscript Δ]) via FRET mechanism. Interaction of the QDs with cationic water-souble MPcs produced ion-pair complexes resulting in aggregates due to strong electronic coupling. The stoichiometry of the reaction and association constants are evaluated by the continuous variation method. Improved photophysicochemical behaviour with no spectral alterations was observed in MPcs in the presence of magnetic fluid. Complexes showed high triplet quantum yields with corresponding long lifetimes and high photostability. Elucidation {{of the results of the}} interaction of bovine serum albumin (BSA) with MPcs or QDs is presented. Increased efficiency of Φ[subscript Δ] generation of MPcs in the presence of BSA coupled with large binding constants, suggesting strong interaction of the MPcs with BSA was observed.

Studies on the effect of the central metal ion, the solvent used and the presence of nanoparticles on the photophysicochemical properties were conducted. The findings showed that the photophysicochemical parameters were mostly enhanced in the presence <b>of</b> <b>central</b> <b>metal</b> ions of high atomic numbers and also in the presence of nanoparticles. It was also observed that solvents that encouraged the monomericity of the MPc complexes also lead to improved photophysical and photochemical behaviour. CdTe quantum dots (QDs) stabilized with mercaptocarbonic acids were also observed to cause stimulated emission of the MPcs through Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) thus acting as energy donors while the respective MPc acted as energy acceptors in all the FRET studies. FRET was observed following the photoexcitation of QDs for all monomeric anionic MPcs but it was also shown to occur for some cationic MPcs in organic media. Both the substituent and solvent used were found to exert a strong influence on the occurrence of FRET. Other cationic MPcs however showed different behaviour {{in the presence of the}} meraptocarbonic stabilized CdTe QDs; with the cationic porphyrazine giving clear indications of Pc ring reduction. The rest of the cationic MPcs did not give clear evidence of Pc ring reduction, instead they showed signs of aggregate formation possibly from the assembly of electrostatic ion pair complexes which could result in reduction of the quaternized pyridinium ring of the substituent. Both the QDs and the MPc complex emission spectra were significantly quenched for each in the presence of the other. Stern-Volmer quenching studies indicated that both static and dynamic quenching of the QDs in the presence of MPcs took place. The fluorescence lifetimes of the mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) capped CdTe QDs in the presence of various MPc complexes showed quenching of mostly the longer lifetimes of the QDs in the presence of MPcs suggesting that the surface defects and states are involved in the interaction of the QDs and MPcs.

Octaethyltetraphenylporphyrin (OETPP) was the early noticed nonplanar porphyrin with saddle-shaped deformation. Interestingly, its corresponding FeIII(OETPP) Cl is quantum-mixed intermediate spin state, which is very common for cytochrome c', an electron transfer protein, but different to the planar iron(III) porphyrin such as FeIII (TPP) Cl and FeIII (OEP) Cl with pure high spin state (S= 5 / 2). In this study, we report the synthesis and characterization of two five coordinate FeIII(OETPP) CN and FeIII(OiPTPP) Cl complexes. We employed spectroscopic techniques, including 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, EPR, DFT theoretical calculations and the measurement of magnetic moment, to characterize and study the spin states with regard to porphyrin ring deformation. FeIII(OETPP) CN shows the reduced 1 H NMR extent of FeIII(OETPP) Cl, ranging from 0 ppm to 25 ppm; the 13 C NMR chemical shift of axial CN- ligand in a characteristic position of 13037 ppm, and the rest carbon peaks of the OETPP spread from - 20 ppm to 400 ppm. The 77 K EPR spectra are incompatible between pure solids, inclined to S = 3 / 2 and in the solvents, such as CH 2 Cl 2 or CHCl 3, with S = 1 / 2. This unusual conflict was proposed that the reassembly of axial CN- ligand and FeIII(OETPP) forms 6 -coordinate FeIII(OETPP) (CN) 2 in low temperature. The DFT calculations shows the diagnostic nuclear spin density which is proportional to the Fermi contact shift, the main contribution of paramagnetic NMR, with varied S = 3 / 2, 4 A 2 (dxy) 2 (dxz,yz) 2 (dz 2) 1, 4 B 1 (dxy) 1 (dxz 2,yz 1) (dz 2) 1,and 4 B 2 (dxy) 1 (dxz 1,yz 2) (dz 2) 1 and show the 4 A 2 most consistent to both of 1 H NMR and 13 C NMR data. Octaisopropyltetraphenylporphyrin (OiPTPP) is designed for more saddle-shaped deformation. The 1 H NMR spectrum of FeIII(OiPTPP) Cl shows the upfiledward shifts comparing to FeIII(OETPP) Cl or FeIII(OMTPP) Cl. 77 K EPR shows an axial symmetry spectrum with g⊥= 4, g// = 2. These signals show Fe(OiPTPP) Cl a pure intermediate-spin state (S= 3 / 2). In the lack of single crystal structure of Fe(OiPTPP) Cl, we adopt structure optimization by ADF calculation. The energy of intermediate-spin state (S= 3 / 2) is the lowest than high-spin (S= 5 / 2) and low-spin (S= 1 / 2), showing S= 3 / 2 is a ground state for Fe(OiPTPP) Cl. Additionally, the magnitude of saddle-shaped deformation of Fe(OiPTPP) Cl is larger than Fe(OETPP) Cl and Fe(OMTPP) Cl crystal structure. Molecular orbital analyses further present when porphyrin ring symmetry lower to C 2 v and consequently the dx 2 -y 2 and dz 2 have same symmetry (a 1) to mix with porphyrin a 2 u orbital. This orbital interaction will not only raise the dx 2 -y 2 orbital higher than planar porphyrin but also enlarge the gap between dx 2 -y 2 and dxy, which stabilizes the S = 3 / 2 spin state accordingly. 目次 論文摘要 第一章、	背景介紹 1 - 1. 	關於血紅素蛋白 [...] 01 1 - 2. 	金屬卟啉的介紹 [...] 04 1 - 3. 	非平面卟啉的介紹 [...] - 08 1 - 4. 	金屬卟啉之電子組態與順磁核磁共振光譜 [...] - 12 1 - 5. 	理論計算 [...] - 24 1 - 5 - 1. 	核自旋密度與金屬卟啉順磁核磁共振光譜的分析 [...] - 30 1 - 5 - 2. 	原理與方法 [...] - 30 1 - 6. 	微波在卟啉上的合成與應用 [...] - 33 1 - 6 - 1. 微波原理 [...] - 33 1 - 6 - 2. 微波加熱和傳統加熱的差異 [...] - 36 1 - 6 - 3. 微波反應裝置 [...] - 37 1 - 6 - 4. 微波於紫質合成上的應用與研究 [...] - 38 Reference [...] - 40 第二章、	金屬卟啉的合成及鐵卟啉氰基錯合物的製備 2 - 1. 	緒論 [...] - 44 2 - 2. 	儀器設備 [...] - 48 2 - 3. 	使用藥品 [...] - 49 2 - 4.

Curs: 2014 / 2015 Transition metal {{complexes}} with 1, 2 -dithiolenes are {{a subject}} of high research interest {{as a consequence of}} their rich redox chemistry, versatility in the coordination modes, biological models 1, 2, as well as their well-known magnetic and electrical conducting properties. Dithiolene ligands have more than one resonant form: dianionic, radical monoanionic and neutral; and the oxidation state assignment of the metal is sometimes ambiguous in these complexes. For this reason, dithiolene ligands are considered as non-innocent. As expected, the dithione form is not feasible in aromatic dithiolenes. Bis(dithiolene) complexes possess an extended electronically delocalized core comprising the <b>central</b> <b>metal,</b> the four sulphurs and the carbon-carbon units. 4 Delocalization can be further extended by functionalization of the ligand. This delocalization can lead to a number of important properties: Electrochemical behavior often which one or more reversible redox processes, Low energy absorption in the visible or NIR region, distribution of the frontier orbitals over much, or all, of the molecules. In most cases, a planar arrangement of the complex with a variety <b>of</b> <b>central</b> <b>metals.</b> Examples include Ni, Pd, Pt, Co, Fe, Au and Cu.  The large sulphur atoms compose part of the delocalized core and as such can mediate intermolecular interactions...|$|R
40|$|The {{ground states}} of HMHe⁺ (M = Li, Na, K) and HMHe²⁺ (M = Be, Mg, Ca) have been {{investigated}} using relativistically-corrected CCSD(T) and IC-MRCI. The HLiHe⁺, HBeHe²⁺, HNaHe⁺ and HMgHe²⁺ ions {{were found to be}} linear in the ground state. Conversely, HKHe⁺ and HCaHe²⁺ were quasi-linear, with ²A'²Σ⁺ barrier heights of ca. 2 and 5 cm⁻¹, respectively. Structural and energetic trends are consistent with H and He sharing covalent and electrostatic bonds with the metal ion, respectively. These trends are also seen to be strictly dependent on the polarisability <b>of</b> the <b>central</b> <b>metal</b> ion...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{adsorption}} {{and the growth}} of FePc and MnPc layer(s) on the Au(111) surface. The evolution of the Au(111) Shockley surface state by molecular deposition has been investigated by means of photoemission spectroscopy. The Shockley surface state undergoes a shift at lower binding energy upon FePc adsorption, indicating a charge redistribution, while for the MnPc molecules the surface state binding energy is constant up to the completion of a single layer. The interaction is mainly driven by the <b>central</b> <b>metal</b> atom and the different orbital configuration induces a charge redistribution <b>of</b> the Fe <b>central</b> atom, while the Mn atoms seem unaffected by the process. Interaction <b>of</b> the <b>central</b> <b>metal</b> atom and charge redistribution are fundamental parameters to control the magnetic state of the single layer of FePc and MnPc on the metal surface. ©Società Italiana di Fisica...|$|R

40|$|The {{energy levels}} of the {{trivalent}} lanthanide ions are rather insensitive to the ligand environment <b>of</b> the <b>central</b> <b>metal</b> ion.

The optical limiting properties were also determined for all the Pcs synthesised. A low-symmetry metallophthalocyanine complex was similarly characterised and the photoelectrochemical parameters determined when used as a sensitiser of nanoporous ZnO. The symmetric analogue was conjugated to gold nanoparticles to determine the influence of interactions on its photophysical properties and distinct differences occurred in the absorption and fluorescence spectra suggesting successful formation of conjugates. ...|$|R
