5|$|<b>Obama</b> <b>is</b> {{frequently}} {{referred to}} as an exceptional orator. During his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, Obama delivered a series of weekly Internet video addresses. Former presidential campaign surrogate and Georgetown professor, Michael Eric Dyson, is both critical and sympathetic of President Obama's leadership in race relations, indicating that Obama's speeches and action on racial disparity and justice have been somewhat reactive and reluctant when, especially in the later part of his second term, racial violence demanded immediate presidential action and conversation.|$|E
5|$|The {{media have}} been criticized for {{focusing}} more on the First Lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions.

In 2008 U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance, and has stated that <b>Obama</b> <b>is</b> miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.|$|E

25|$|Building {{up to the}} 2012 presidential election, it was {{interesting}} to see how strong the influence of social media would be following the 2008 campaigns, where Obama's winning campaign had been social media-heavy, whereas McCain's campaign did not really grasp social media. JFK was the first president who really understood television, and similarly, <b>Obama</b> <b>is</b> the first president to fully understand the power of social media. Obama has recognized social media is about creating relationships and connections and therefore used social media to the advantage of presidential election campaigns, in which Obama has dominated his opponents in terms of social media space.|$|E

25|$|Obama's {{campaign}} organization {{responded with}} a letter from Christian leaders vouching for his Christian faith, {{as well as with}} appeals to supporters to help correct any misunderstanding. From November 2007 to January 2008, as part of a drive to promote awareness of his Christian faith, Obama gave interviews to Pat Robertson's Christian Broadcasting Network, to Christianity Today and to the religious website Beliefnet.com. Nevertheless, the false belief that <b>Obama</b> <b>is</b> a Muslim has persisted in some key demographics and is among the most frequently cited reasons for opposition to Obama in public polling.
