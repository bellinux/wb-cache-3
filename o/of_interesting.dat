40|$|Abstract. Template Attacks {{are widely}} {{accepted}} {{to be the}} most power-ful side-channel attacks from an information theoretic point of view. For classical Template Attacks, several papers suggested an accepted guide-line <b>of</b> choosing <b>interesting</b> points. The accepted guideline is that one should only choose one point as the interesting point per clock cycle. Up to now, many methods <b>of</b> choosing <b>interesting</b> points were intro-duced. However, it is still unclear that which method will lead to the best classification performance for Template Attacks. In this paper, we comprehensively compare the classification performance of Template At-tacks when using different known methods <b>of</b> choosing <b>interesting</b> points. Evaluation results show that CPA based method and SOST will lead to the best classification performance. Moreover, we find that some of the methods <b>of</b> choosing <b>interesting</b> points are essentially equivalent. In addi-tional, we give out a more reasonable proof about the accepted guideline <b>of</b> choosing <b>interesting</b> points for Template Attacks by presenting a new way of conducting Template Attacks...|$|R

Adams also recorded the group's tour soundchecks. In January 1993, the band asked him to compile these recordings and create loops <b>of</b> <b>interesting</b> parts that they could play to in the studio. After Adams spent a few weeks assembling loops, the group entered The Factory in Dublin that February to begin composing rough demos. Bono and The Edge were most involved during this initial demoing process, which lasted six weeks.|$|E

Jon Garelick with the Boston Phoenix was of the opinion that the subculture of the docks (second season) was not as absorbing as that of the housing projects (first season), but he went on to praise the writers for creating a realistic world and populating it with an array <b>of</b> <b>interesting</b> characters.|$|E
5|$|Classic {{learning}} {{theories and}} the modern dual-coding theory support the introduction <b>of</b> <b>interesting,</b> tangential details to learning content. There is evidence that interesting and engaging information promotes image-based thoughts and is better remembered because it allows storage of material in both verbal and nonverbal systems. This suggests that interesting material, even if tangential to the topic, does not detract from learning and can promote recall of vague or uninteresting material.|$|E

5|$|Salford {{is linked}} to Manchester {{by a series of}} bridges, {{including}} the Grade II listed Blackfriars Bridge, completed in 1820. The settlement is dominated by the several railway viaducts built in the 19th century. Salford (Old) Town Hall, situated in Bexley Square off Chapel Street, is a Neo-classical brick building dressed in stone, designed by Richard Lane. Public swimming baths were provided, on Blackfriars Road. Now in commercial use, the two-storey building was constructed in about 1890 from brick, with terracotta dressings and a part-glazed roof. The Salford University Campus, visible partly from the Crescent, contains a number <b>of</b> <b>interesting</b> buildings including the Royal Art Gallery and the Peel Building.|$|E
5|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{contains a}} range <b>of</b> <b>interesting</b> compounds in small quantities, including some based on hydrogen, such as hydrogen chloride (HCl) and hydrogen fluoride (HF). There is carbon monoxide, water vapour and atomic oxygen as well. Hydrogen is in relatively short {{supply in the}} Venusian atmosphere. A large amount of the planet's hydrogen is theorised to have been lost to space, with the remainder being mostly bound up in sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The loss of significant amounts of hydrogen is proven by a very high D–H ratio measured in the Venusian atmosphere. The ratio is about 0.015–0.025, which is 100–150 {{times higher than the}} terrestrial value of 1.6. According to some measurements, in the upper atmosphere of Venus D/H ratio is 1.5 higher than in the bulk atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Well, I {{think the}} subject of race has been so {{difficult}} and so polluted by malign ideas that most people have just left it alone, including geneticists. … Most genetic variation is neutral – it doesn't do anything for or against the phenotype, and evolution ignores it – so most previous attempts to look at race have concluded that there's little difference between races. I think this position is the one on which the social scientists are basing their position. … If {{you look at the}} genes that do make a difference, selected genes, which are a tiny handful of the whole, you do find a number of differences, not very many, but a number <b>of</b> <b>interesting</b> differences between races as to which genes have been selected. This, of course, makes a lot of sense, because once the human family dispersed from its homeland in Africa, people faced different environments on each continent, different climates, different evolutionary challenges, and each group adapted to its environment in its own way.|$|E
