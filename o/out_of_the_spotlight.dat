5|$|After {{many years}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight,</b> Robertson was {{recognized}} on November 17, 2006 for his impact on college basketball {{when he was}} chosen {{to be a member}} of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was one of five people, along with John Wooden, Bill Russell, Dean Smith and Dr. James Naismith, selected to represent the inaugural class.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were not <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight.</b> Since the ministers were {{inferior to the}} King within the executive branch, the King was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers {{were responsible for the}} advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. The King was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} give the LM {{national}} exposure, Hall decided to stand for the Australian Senate at the 1974 federal election. Another objective was to allow Millhouse and Cameron to become more prominent at state level and dispel the established perception of the LM as a Hall party. The move was a risk as failure would have left the LM's main drawcard <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> entirely until a state election which was not due for another two years, but Hall said the party had no future unless it could gain national stature. Another possible {{problem was that the}} media could have lost interest in the LM at a state level regardless of whether Hall won a senate position. The 1975 federal election followed a double dissolution (meaning that all Senate seats, rather than half, were up for election and thus a candidate needed only roughly half of the normal percentage to gain election; Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was hoping to attain a majority in the Senate), and all ten South Australian Senate seats were contested. The battle between the LCL and the LM was not seen as {{a large part of the}} national campaign, as South Australia was only a small part of the nation and most of the marginal seats that would determine the outcome were in other states. The LM gained 9.9 per cent of the vote in the Senate and Hall was elected in his own right, without the assistance of preferences. In the House of Representatives, the LM gained 8.4 per cent of the vote across the 12 South Australian seats, ranging from a high of 18 per cent in metropolitan Boothby to 1.6 per cent in rural Angas. Fortunately for Hall and the LM, the senate election resulted in Labor and the Liberal-Country Party coalition holding 29 seats each, and Hall was one of two crossbenchers who held the balance of power. The media made much of Hall's position as a powerbroker at federal level, and the Liberals responded to him in a hostile manner; for his part, Hall continued to persistently attack them as outmoded and lambasted them over the matter of electoral reform.|$|E
50|$|Former Blondie drummer Clem Burke {{replaced}} David Petratos as the Romantics' drummer in 1990. For much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, the Romantics played obscure {{performances in}} small venues, largely forgotten and <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public <b>spotlight.</b>|$|R
25|$|After declaring his {{retirement}} from football in 2005, Keegan remained <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> media <b>spotlight,</b> working at <b>the</b> Soccer Circus football school in Glasgow. In October 2007, he indicated he {{was unlikely to}} manage again.|$|R
50|$|By mid-1996, Staley was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public <b>spotlight,</b> {{never to}} perform live again. Staley {{struggled}} {{for much of}} his adult life with depression and a drug addiction, culminating with his death on April 5, 2002.|$|R
25|$|The smears {{succeeded in}} pushing Dolci <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> in Italy. The last 20 {{years of his}} life he {{disappeared}} from public view, although he continued to be revered abroad, winning prizes for his poetry, and working as a guest lecturer at universities.|$|E
25|$|Paxman {{formerly}} {{lived with}} Elizabeth Ann Clough in Stonor, southeast Oxfordshire. They have three adult children. The couple, {{who did not}} marry, amicably separated in 2016 after 35 years together. He always tries to keep his private life <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> and he also claims {{that he has no}} interest in the private life of others.|$|E
25|$|Technological {{advances}} and a changing security environment made the sovereignty issue fall <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> in both countries, but recently, {{there has been}} renewed interest due to climate change making passage more accessible to commercial ships and oil drilling easier. As a result, Canada is seeing an upraise in political will towards international recognition of its rights over the region.|$|E
50|$|Keyvan and Marjan Abbassi, the UK-based Iranian {{couple who}} {{launched}} Marjan TV, in 2009, stay <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> media <b>spotlight.</b> They and other Marjan TV {{officials declined to}} comment for this story despite repeated requests for interviews.|$|R
5|$|Nash {{spent five}} years <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cricketing <b>spotlight</b> (although he {{dominated}} Melbourne district cricket, the Victorian selectors refused to select him and he never played a Sheffield Shield match). In 1936–1937 he topped the district cricket bowling averages.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, Carr met a Malaysian {{economics}} student, Helena John on {{a holiday}} in Tahiti, and they married on 24 February 1973. Helena Carr became a successful businesswoman, while she largely remained <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> political <b>spotlight</b> during her husband's career.|$|R
25|$|While the Church of Noise {{single in}} March 1998 failed commercially, {{it marked the}} return of the band {{following}} three years <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight.</b> The Semi-Detached album transcended the trajectory of Troublegum and Infernal Love with their dark, broody atmosphere. However, promotion for the album was scant at best, due to problems at the A label, which culminated in the loss of their record deal with the company. Without label support, Cairns and McKeegan needed to finance the band's European tour in late 1998 themselves.|$|E
25|$|Cornell {{ended his}} career as a highly {{regarded}} artist but remained <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight.</b> He produced fewer box assemblages in the 1950s and 1960s, as his family responsibilities increased and claimed more of his time. He hired a series of young assistants, including both students and established artists, to help him organize material, make artwork, and run errands. At this time, Cornell concentrated on making collages, and collaborated with filmmakers like Rudy Burckhardt, Stan Brakhage, and Larry Jordan to make films that were evocative of moving collages.|$|E
25|$|Mekkonen {{attended}} the 1999 and 2001 World Championships in Athletics and represented Ethiopia at the 2000 Summer Olympics, but {{he failed to}} make the podium at any of the events. His form improved in 2002 and he won the short race bronze and team silver at the World Cross Country Championships. He focused on the track in 5000m the next year and won the 2003 All-Africa Games silver and the 2003 Afro-Asian Games gold medal. After a long time <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> of international competition he re-emerged in 2009 after switching to the half marathon and marathon.|$|E
500|$|In 2009 Moro Jr. {{changed his}} ring character, {{adopting}} the name [...] "El Hijo del Pentagón", playing off {{the fact that}} his father portrayed the original Pentagón late in his career.

25|$|After {{appearing}} on The Real World, Winick {{and his former}} costar, Pam Ling, began to date. Winick proposed to her with a cartoon he made for the occasion, and which he presented to her while wearing a gorilla suit. The cartoon presented Ling with two choices to answer his proposal. After she accepted his proposal, he summoned three singing Elvises. Winick and Ling married in a civil ceremony on August 26, 2001. Writer Armistead Maupin spoke at their ceremony. As of 2008, they have two children, {{a son and a}} daughter, whom they work to keep <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight,</b> preferring to omit photos of them from social media, and publications who interview the couple to omit their names.|$|E
25|$|After Hawn's Academy Award win, {{her film}} career took off. She starred {{in a string}} of above average and {{successful}} comedies starting with There's a Girl in My Soup (1970), $ (1971), and Butterflies Are Free (1972). She continued proving herself in the dramatic league with the 1974 satirical dramas The Girl from Petrovka and The Sugarland Express, and Shampoo in 1975. She also hosted two television specials: Pure Goldie in 1971 and The Goldie Hawn Special in 1978. The latter was a sort of comeback for Hawn, who had been <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> for two years since the 1976 release of The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox, while she was focusing on her marriage and the birth of her son.|$|E
25|$|In 1966, Dalton Camp, who by {{then was}} {{president}} of the Progressive Conservative Party, ran for re-election in what many believed to be a referendum on Diefenbaker's leadership. Diefenbaker had reached his 70th birthday in 1965. Mulroney joined with most of his generation in supporting Camp and opposing Diefenbaker, but due to his past friendship with Diefenbaker, he attempted to stay <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight.</b> With Camp's narrow victory, Diefenbaker called for a 1967 leadership convention in Toronto. Mulroney joined with Joe Clark and others in supporting former Justice minister E. Davie Fulton. Once Fulton dropped off the ballot, Mulroney helped in swinging most of his organization over to Robert Stanfield, who won. Mulroney, then 28, would soon become a chief adviser to the new leader in Quebec.|$|E
50|$|Franz {{has stayed}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> acting <b>spotlight</b> since 2005 {{to focus on}} his private life.

50|$|Smith {{formally}} {{retired from}} boxing in 1959. The years passed by, and Smith dropped <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public <b>spotlight.</b> His life {{was far from}} an easy one, with several brushes with the law, but the good-natured Smith was a popular figure in his neighborhood.|$|R
50|$|Rehabilitating {{completely}} <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> media <b>spotlight,</b> King drove {{himself back}} into competitive shape. Despite averaging 22.7 {{points per game}} during his first six games back, he had not recovered his pre-injury explosiveness and was released by the Knicks at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1987 season.|$|R
25|$|In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000), the Weasleys invite Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup. Ron is {{in awe of}} his {{favourite}} Quidditch champion, Viktor Krum. Ron is {{even more}} excited when Krum, still {{a student at the}} Durmstrang wizarding school, comes to Hogwarts {{to take part in the}} Triwizard Tournament, a magical wizarding tournament opposing the top three magic schools in Europe. However, when Harry, underage, mysteriously becomes the fourth Tournament champion, Ron joins the dissenters who think Harry somehow cheated his way into the tournament and feels let down; according to Hermione, this stems from Ron's latent envy caused by being left <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> shared by Harry or his brothers. The rift is serious enough that the friends fail to make up for nearly a month. They only reconcile shortly after Harry successfully gets by a fire-breathing dragon in the first task; Ron realises how dangerous the Tournament is and finally believes that Harry did not enter himself.|$|E

500|$|Others, {{including}} the Portland chapter of American Institute of Architects, Vera Katz, Laurie Olin, and Michael Powell (of Powell's Books) were against the plan, with Powell saying [...] "I {{was sort of}} {{under the impression that}} people came downtown to work and shop, not to gain a rural experience". By 2004, the idea to reunite the Park Blocks through midtown was dead, due to Neil Goldschmidt moving <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight</b> during his sex abuse scandal, Vera Katz's disapproval of the plan, and because Moyer was [...] "tired of swimming upstream" [...] against the city council.|$|E
500|$|Ryan {{spent much}} of her teen years <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spotlight.</b> She {{explained}} in 2014 that she had put her career on hold {{to go back to school}} even though, as it turned out, she hated high schoolbesides [...] "a couple of stalkers", she was mostly ignored by other students and didn't make any friends until after school was over.

Ryan described her musical style as a blend of neo soul, R and pop.|$|E

50|$|Congressman Wolfenden {{generally}} kept a low profile, in {{line with}} McClure's wishes that War Board members keep <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> public <b>spotlight.</b> Less {{than a year after}} he took office, the stock market crash occurred in October 1929 and <b>the</b> protracted misery <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Depression began for the American people.|$|R
