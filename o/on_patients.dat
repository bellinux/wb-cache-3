5|$|Physicians: Medical care is {{traditionally}} focused on curing and healing the patient. For many, hospice {{care is not}} seen as the true practice of medicine. Physicians face a persistent social stigma in that hospice is mistaken as giving up on a patient, rather than committing to palliation. Additionally, and although this perception has been changing, when thinking of hospice the doctor is often focused <b>on</b> <b>patients</b> with cancer and not {{many of the other}} terminal diseases which qualify for hospice care.|$|E
5|$|The {{procedure}} {{should not}} be used without a medical indication, such as with a reason to expect that a person is at heightened risk of having deep vein thrombosis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{a strong}} {{movement}} towards active patient involvement in healthcare policy decisions, systematic and explicit consideration {{of evidence of}} this research <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences seems limited. Furthermore, {{little is known about}} the opinions of several stakeholders towards consideration of research evidence <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences in healthcare policy decisions. This paper describes the protocol for an explorative study on the integration of research <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences in healthcare policy decisions. The study questions: to what extent research evidence <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences is considered in current procedures for healthcare policy decisions; opinions of stakeholders regarding the integration of this type of evidence in healthcare policy decisions; and what could be a decision framework for the integration of such research evidence in healthcare policy decisions. METHODS/DESIGN: The study is divided in three sub-studies, predominantly using qualitative methods. The first sub-study is a scoping review in five European countries to investigate whether and how results of research <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences are considered in current procedures for coverage decisions and clinical practice guideline development. The second sub-study is a qualitative study to explore the opinions of stakeholders with regard to the possibilities for integrating evidence <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences in the process of healthcare decision-making in the Netherlands. The third sub-study is the development of a decision framework for research <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences. The framework will consist of: a process description regarding the place of evidence <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences in the decision-making process; and a taxonomy describing different terminologies and conceptualisations of 'preferences' and an overview of existing methodologies for investigating preferences. The concept framework will be presented to and discussed with experts. DISCUSSION: This study will create awareness regarding the existence and potential value of research evidence <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences for healthcare policy decision-making and provides insight in the methods for investigating patient preferences and the barriers and facilitators for integration of such research in healthcare policy decisions. Results of the study will be useful for researchers, clinical practice guideline developers, healthcare policy makers, and patient representatives...|$|R

In addition, an audit of the hospital contract found that the Sanatorium Company, which owned the hospital, had been padding its expenses. This had enabled it to make an excess profit of $69,000 per year (equivalent to over $588,000 per year at 2007 prices).|$|E
5|$|For centuries, {{tracheotomy}} {{was considered}} the only reliable method for intubation of the trachea. However, because {{only a minority of}} patients survived the operation, physicians undertook tracheotomy only as a last resort, <b>on</b> <b>patients</b> who were nearly dead. It was not until the late 19th century however that advances in understanding of anatomy and physiology, as well an appreciation of the germ theory of disease, had improved the outcome of this operation {{to the point that it}} could be considered an acceptable treatment option. Also at that time, advances in endoscopic instrumentation had improved to such a degree that direct laryngoscopy had become a viable means to secure the airway by the non-surgical orotracheal route. By the mid-20th century, the tracheotomy as well as endoscopy and non-surgical tracheal intubation had evolved from rarely employed procedures to becoming essential components of the practices of anesthesiology, critical care medicine, emergency medicine, and laryngology.|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} number of research publications <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences, their use in healthcare policy-making is limited. Integrating research evidence <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences in policy-making is advocated by some, but several issues are put forward as well. There has been no systematic investigation of the stakeholders' view on this matter so far. Objective is to explore the opinions of Dutch stakeholders on how to integrate evidence <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences in pharmaceutical coverage decisions and clinical practice guideline (CPG) development, and which issues may be encountered. METHODS: Qualitative study with semi-structured interviews with Dutch researchers (N= 7), policy-makers and CPG developers (N= 4) and patient representatives (N= 4) involved in pharmaceutical coverage decisions and/or CPG development. The interview scheme focused on the definition of patient preferences; how to integrate evidence <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences in decision-making; and barriers and facilitators. RESULTS: Respondents mentioned various barriers and facilitators for integration, of conceptual, normative, procedural, methodological and practical nature. There is also variety in the terms and definitions used for preferences, complicating searching and synthesising evidence. It is not clear how to integrate evidence <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences in different decision contexts, and what weight preferences should have in relation to other decision criteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed important issues that need guidance when integrating evidence <b>on</b> <b>patient</b> preferences in healthcare policy decisions...|$|R

Zhang's major work was the Treatise on Cold Injury and Miscellaneous Disorders (Shanghan zabing lun). His contemporary and alleged associate Hua Tuo (d. 208 CE) was a physician who had studied the Huangdi neijing and became knowledgeable in Chinese herbology. Hua Tuo used anesthesia <b>on</b> <b>patients</b> during surgery and created an ointment that was meant to fully heal surgery wounds within a month.

The pilot study found that, when administered by trained professionals in a medical setting, the use of psilocybin was associated with substantial reductions in OCD symptoms in several of the patients. This effect is caused largely by psilocybin's ability to reduce the levels of the 5-HT2A receptor, resulting in decreased responsiveness to serotonin.|$|E

5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the shared ability of humans to reason should {{be the basis of}} morality, and that it is the ability to reason that makes humans morally significant. He, therefore, {{believed that}} all humans {{should have the right to}} common dignity and respect. Margaret Eaton argues that, according to Kant's ethics, a medical professional must be happy for their own practices to be used by and on anyone, even if they were the patient themselves. For example, a researcher who wished to perform tests <b>on</b> <b>patients</b> without their knowledge must be happy for all researchers to do so. She also argues that Kant's requirement of autonomy would mean that a patient must be able to make a fully informed decision about treatment, making it immoral to perform tests on unknowing patients. Medical research should be motivated out of respect for the patient, so they must be informed of all facts, even if this would be likely to dissuade the patient. Jeremy Sugarman has argued that Kant's formulation of autonomy requires that patients are never used merely for the benefit of society, but are always treated as rational people with their own goals. Aaron Hinkley notes that a Kantian account of autonomy requires respect for choices that are arrived at rationally, not for choices which are arrived at by idiosyncratic or non-rational means. He argues that there may be some difference between what a purely rational agent would choose and what a patient actually chooses, the difference being the result of non-rational idiosyncrasies. Although a Kantian physician ought not to lie to or coerce a patient, Hinkley suggests that some form of paternalism - such as through withholding information which may prompt a non-rational response - could be acceptable.|$|E
