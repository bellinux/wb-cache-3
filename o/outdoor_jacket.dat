60|$|With this dwarf tree in my arms, when {{came the}} auspicious afternoon, I {{followed}} Lady Pollacke's parlourmaid--her neat little bonnet {{tied with a}} bow under her ear--down my Bateses, and was lifted by Mrs Bowater into the carriage. How demure a greeting we exchanged when, the maid and I having seated ourselves together under its hood, my glance fell upon the bloodstone brooch pinned conspicuously for the occasion near the topmost button of her trim, <b>outdoor</b> <b>jacket.</b> It gave me so much confidence that even the sudden clatter of conversation that gushed out over me {{in the doorway of}} Lady Pollacke's drawing-room failed to be disconcerting. The long, flowery room was thronged with company, and everybody was talking to everybody else. On my entry, as if a seraph had spoken, the busy tongues sank instantly to a hush. I stood stilettoed by a score of eyes. But Sir Walter had been keeping good watch for me, and I at once delivered my great pot into his pink, outstretched hands.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{discussed the}} potential of combinations between multi-activities and multi-functions elements as a new approach in producing <b>outdoor</b> <b>jacket.</b> The design is appropriate with weather condition in Southeast Asia with waterproof high-tech fabric function that aimed to provide comfort to users. The <b>outdoor</b> <b>jacket</b> {{is designed to provide}} warm when walking, cycling, mountaineering etc. The jackets are flexible and can be worn in any types of weather condition. The main purpose of outdoor and travel clothing is to protect wearers from all types of weather and make travelling more comfortable. Such clothing is manufactured to provide added protection and insulation. The designed jackets not only stylish but protect wearers from rain, wind and also offer warmth. The objectives of this research to; (i) identify the new potential design range for <b>outdoor</b> <b>jacket</b> that is suitable to wear in the Southeast Asia, (ii) examine the design styles of an <b>outdoor</b> <b>jacket</b> that portray the high-tech fashion features (iii) identify the design elements that need to be considered in an <b>outdoor</b> <b>jacket</b> that can meet the multi-activities purposes. A pilot test was conducted and distributed to a selected group based on their activities in order to identify which design is more we can know which design is suitable and meet the customer’s needs. This research used several methods including interview, observation and questionnaire. Result from this research showed that there is a great potential of designing multi-activities and multi-function jacket in meeting today’s costumer needs who enjoys a healthy lifestyle and outdoor activities...|$|E
40|$|Background: In Korea, {{a healthy}} 36 -year-old man {{developed}} acute interstitial pneumonitis soon after inhaling a waterproofing spray {{which he had}} applied at home to his <b>outdoor</b> <b>jacket.</b> Objectives: The objectives {{of this study were}} to review cases of varying degrees of respiratory toxicity and poisoning in connection with the use of waterproofing spray and summarize major reasons for cases of poisoning. Methods: We searched articles reporting on a combination of a waterproofing agent and/or respiratory symptoms, including acute respiratory syndrome, lung injury, pneumonia, pulmonary toxicity, and respiratory disease. Results: We reviewed a number of cases of varying degrees of respiratory toxicity and poisoning resulting from inhalation of waterproofing spray containing fluorocarbon co-polymer, solvents and propellants reported in a variety of countries. The literature searches concluded that among the ingredients of waterproofing agents, fluorinated polymer may cause acute respiratory health effects. Conclusion: Environmental policy should be implemented in order to prevent consumers from using household and industrial products including waterproofing agents. In addition, a national surveillance system should b...|$|E

30|$|Although the {{production}} volume of PFOA is relatively low in industrialized countries, {{it is still}} detected {{in a number of}} consumer products. Especially in products with water, dirt, and grease repellent properties like treated carpets (0.2 to 6 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 PFOA [21]), <b>outdoor</b> <b>jackets</b> (0.08 to 0.6 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 PFOA [19]), and impregnating agents (up to 3.6 [*]μg[*]mL− 1 PFOA [22]) PFOA was found. For example in Norway the import of articles was figured out as main source since there is no manufacturing and use of PFOA itself. Carpets, coated and impregnated paper, textiles, paint and lacquer (12 [*]kg, 1.3 [*]kg, 0.5 [*]kg and 1 [*]kg annual maximal PFOA emission in Norway, respectively) have been identified as a potential source for PFOA in Norway [19].|$|R

40|$|Quilted fabrics {{are more}} and more {{frequently}} used in <b>outdoor</b> clothing, especially <b>jackets.</b> They are usually composed of two or three layers connected together by sewing or thermal quilting. They are characterised by different properties, depending on the structure of the quilted fabrics. In the presented work, five variants of quilted fabrics were studied in terms of of their comfort-related properties, such as thermal resistance, thermal conductivity, thermal absorptivity, water-vapour resistance and air permeability. On the basis of the results, it was possible to assess the quilted fabrics {{from the point of view}} of their usability for outdoor clothing...|$|R
