2500|$|In 1911, {{the courts}} {{declared}} Standard Oil Trust a monopoly and broke it into several companies. Between 1887 and 1905, the Lima Oil Field was a world-class producer, yielding [...] Lima {{was also a}} pipeline center. Within {{three years of the}} discovery of <b>oil,</b> a <b>trunk</b> <b>line</b> reached Chicago. Lima oil lit the buildings of the 1893 World's Fair. Production peaked in 1904, and then dropped off rapidly. By 1910, the field was regarded as virtually played out. Still, the Lima Refinery has survived, continuing to operate for more than 125 years under a succession of owners—Solar Refining Company (1886), a subsidiary of Standard Oil until the breakup in 1911, SOHIO (1931), British Petroleum (1987), Clark USA (1998), Premcor (2000), Valero Energy Corporation (2005), and most recently Husky Energy (2007).|$|R

40|$|The U. S. liquid {{petroleum}} pipeline {{industry is}} large, diverse, and {{vital to the}} nation's economy. Comprised of approximately 200, 000 miles of pipe in all fifty states, liquid petroleum pipelines carried more than 40 million barrels per day, or 4 trillion barrel-miles, of crude oil and refined products during 2001. That represents about 17 % of all freight transported in the United States, yet {{the cost of doing}} so amounted to only 2 % of the nation's freight bill. Approximately 66 % of domestic petroleum transport (by ton-mile) occurs by pipeline, with marine movements accounting for 28 % and rail and truck transport making up the balance. In 2004, the movement of crude petroleum by domestic federally regulated pipelines amounted to 599. 6 billion tonmiles, while that of petroleum products amounted to 315. 9 billion ton-miles (AOPL 2006). As an illustration of the low cost of pipeline transportation, the cost to move a barrel of gasoline from Houston, Texas, to New York Harbor is only 3 cents per gallon, which is {{a small fraction of the}} cost of gasoline to consumers. Pipelines may be small or large, up to 48 inches in diameter. Nearly all of the mainline pipe is buried, but other pipeline components such as pump stations are above ground. Some lines are as short as a mile, while others may extend 1, 000 miles or more. Some are very simple, connecting a single source to a single destination, while others are very complex, having many sources, destinations, and interconnections. Many pipelines cross one or more state boundaries (interstate), while some are located within a single state (intrastate), and still others operate on the Outer Continental Shelf and may or may not extend into one or more states. U. S. pipelines are located in coastal plains, deserts, Arctic tundra, mountains, and more than a mile beneath the water's surface of the Gulf of Mexico (Rabinow 2004; AOPL 2006). The network of crude oil pipelines in the United States is extensive. There are approximately 55, 000 miles of crude <b>oil</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>lines</b> (usually 8 to 24 inches in diameter) in the United States that connect regional markets. The United States also has an estimated 30, 000 to 40, 000 miles of small gathering lines (usually 2 to 6 inches in diameter) located primarily in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Wyoming, with small systems in a number of other oil producing states. These small lines gather the oil from many wells, both onshore and offshore, and connect to larger <b>trunk</b> <b>lines</b> measuring 8 to 24 inches in diameter. There are approximately 95, 000 miles of refined products pipelines nationwide. Refined products pipelines are found in almost every state in the United States, with the exception of some New England states. These refined product pipelines vary in size from relatively small, 8 - to 12 -inch-diameter lines, to up to 42 inches in diameter. The overview of pipeline design, installation, and operation provided in the following sections is only a cursory treatment. Readers interested in more detailed discussions are invited to consult the myriad engineering publications available that provide such details. The two primary publications on which the following discussions are based are: Oil and Gas Pipeline Fundamentals (Kennedy 1993) and the Pipeline Rules of Thumb Handbook (McAllister 2002). Both are recommended references for additional reading for those requiring additional details. Websites maintained by various pipeline operators also can provide much useful information, as well as links to other sources of information. In particular, the website maintained by the U. S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration (EIA) ([URL] is recommended. An excellent bibliography on pipeline standards and practices, including special considerations for pipelines in Arctic climates, has been published jointly by librarians for the Alyeska Pipeline Service Company (operators of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System [TAPS]) and the Geophysical Institute/International Arctic Research Center, both located in Fairbanks (Barboza and Trebelhorn 2001), available electronically at [URL] codes. The Association of Oil Pipe Lines (AOPL) and the American Petroleum Institute (API) jointly provide an overview covering the life cycle of design, construction, operations, maintenance, economic regulation, and deactivation of liquid pipelines (AOPL/API 2007) ...|$|R

25|$|NSB made four {{proposals}} {{for a new}} railway to Gardermoen. The simplest devised constructing a branch from the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> at a location north of Jessheim Station which would run to the airport. Alternatively, and ultimately selected, was construction of a tunnel eastwards from Oslo to Lillestrøm and an upgrade of the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> and a new route from a point at Asper to the airport. Two more direct routes were proposed; the one branching off from north of Grefsen Station on the Gjøvik Line, the other diverting from the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> close to Grorud Station. All four routes called for the railway to continue north from Gardermoen and meet up with the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> at Bøn Station.|$|R

25|$|Several routes were {{considered}} for the Loenga–Alnabru Line. The {{need to keep the}} gradient at bay meant that the tracks were placed at a lower elevation than the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line,</b> with the two not reaching the same height until Bryn Station. At the same time the company needed {{to stay away from the}} Alna River. Meanwhile, the Gjøvik Line was built with a branch, the Alna Line, which connected to Alnabru. Just northeast of the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> was placed in a culvert under the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line</b> so it would meet up with the Alna Line. The Loenga–Alnabru Line was completed between Bryn and Alnabru in May 1904. with this work being carried out at the same time as the doubling of the <b>Trunk</b> <b>Line.</b> The section from Loenga to Bryn opened on 1 May 1907.|$|R

40|$|To balance {{three-phase}} loads in {{distribution network}} with abundant of single-phase loads, a new wiring method and three-phase loads adjustment policy was proposed in this paper. In the wiring method, a single-phase load was connected with phase A, B and C of <b>trunk</b> <b>line</b> by a controller. When the load of <b>trunk</b> <b>line</b> was unbalanced, the controller will switch the connected single-phase loads from one phase to another to balance it. The minimum count of loads adjustment algorithm {{and the most}} balance adjustment algorithm were proposed, which can adjust the three-phase load of <b>trunk</b> <b>line</b> to roughly balance automatically. This method can solve the serious three-phase unbalance problems of the <b>trunk</b> <b>lines</b> with aboundant of single-phase loads. It may instead of capacitive compensation in low voltage distribution network to improve power quality and reduce network losses.  </p...|$|R
