5|$|Architects who {{push the}} {{boundaries}} of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed the expectations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> the client and are aesthetically outstanding.

Other apparently usable buildings are really follies, deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.|$|E
5|$|Charitable trusts in English law are {{a form of}} {{express trust}} {{dedicated}} to charitable goals. There {{are a variety of}} advantages to charitable trust status, including exception from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English trust. To be a valid charitable trust, the organisation must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a public benefit. Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into categories for public benefit including the relief of poverty, the promotion of education, the advancement of health and saving of lives, promotion of religion and all other types of trust recognised by the law. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public),</b> <b>and</b> not simply a group of private individuals.|$|E

5|$|In April 1878, L'Estrange reappeared on the Australian {{scene with}} a new {{performance}} – gas ballooning. The first balloon ascent in Australia {{had been made in}} Melbourne in 1853, with Sydney following five years later in December 1858. The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired the imagination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>and</b> the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s. No doubt the very real chance of disaster and injury added to the crowd's keen interest, as mishaps were not uncommon.|$|E

5|$|Just as the {{new design}} was {{approaching}} finalisation, the LMS marketing department created a problem that was close to being insurmountable. The London & North Eastern Railway (LNER) had recently introduced its streamlined Class A4 locomotive which had captured the imagination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>and</b> the marketing department persuaded the board that the LMS's new locomotives should be streamlined too. This was problematic in that the new design was so large that it only just conformed to the maximum loading gauge for the main line; moreover, it was sufficiently heavy that {{it was close to}} the Civil Engineer's maximum weight limit. Nevertheless, Coleman managed to design a streamlined steel casing that hugged the locomotive so tightly that it could still meet the loading gauge. The casing weighed some , but Coleman managed to save an equivalent weight in the locomotive itself.|$|E
5|$|Limited to {{two terms}} as governor, Hatfield {{announced}} his candidacy in the 1966 U.S. Senate election {{for the seat}} vacated by the retiring Maurine Neuberger. During the Vietnam War, and during an election year, {{he was the only}} person to vote against a resolution by a governors' conference that expressed support for the U.S. involvement in the war in 1966. At that time the war was supported by 75percent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>and</b> was also supported by Hatfield's opponent in the November election. He won the primary election with 178,782 votes compared to a combined 56,760votes for three opponents. Hatfield then defeated Democratic Congressman Robert Duncan in the election. In order to finish his term as governor, which ended on January 9, 1967, he delayed taking his oath of office in the Senate until January 10 instead of the usual January 3.|$|E
5|$|On 20 June 1791, a plot, {{dubbed the}} Flight to Varennes, almost allowed the king {{to escape from}} France. As leader of the National Guard, Lafayette had been {{responsible}} for the royal family's custody. He was thus blamed by extremists like Danton for the near-escape and called a traitor to the people by Robespierre. These accusations made Lafayette appear a royalist, damaging his reputation in the eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>and</b> strengthened the hands of the Jacobins and other radicals. Lafayette continued to urge the constitutional rule of law, but was drowned out by the mob and its leaders.|$|E

5|$|Several {{months after}} the {{recommendation}} to have thiomersal removed from vaccines was published, a speculative article was published in Medical Hypotheses, a non-peer-reviewed journal, by parents who launched the parental advocacy group SafeMinds to promote the theory that thiomersal caused autism. The controversy began to gain legitimacy in the eyes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> gained widening support within certain elements in the autism advocacy {{community as well as}} in the political arena, with U.S. Representative Dan Burton openly supporting this movement and holding a number of Congressional hearings on the subject.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{military}} involvement in Afghanistan began in 2002 with the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), a coalition of soldiers from 42 countries, which was tasked as a counterinsurgency effort {{in response to the}} September 11 attacks. ISAF had initially been established as a stabilization force by the United Nations Security Council on 20 December 2001, to secure Kabul. The Canadian Liberal government at the time, under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien, chose to have the Canadian Forces (CF) hand over its prisoners to the United States, who led the fight against al-Qaeda and other insurgents. After NATO took command of Afghanistan in 2003, Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse {{at the hands of the}} United States armed forces in Iraq came to the attention <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>and</b> Canada soon faced pressure to hand their prisoners to someone else. Canada entered into an agreement with the Afghan government and started transferring detainees to Afghan security forces, which comprised the Afghan National Army (ANA) and the Afghan National Directorate of Security (NDS).|$|E
5|$|Evans {{frequently}} quarrelled {{with fellow}} inventors and engineering peers over steam {{technology in the}} mid-1800s. His increasing frustration led to his premature publication {{of what he had}} hoped would be the equivalent of his earlier manual for millers—the petulantly titled The Abortion of the Young Steam Engineer's Guide. The Steam Engineer's Guide was significantly shorter than this first book and less structured in its approach. A third of the book is devoted to an ongoing argument between Evans and John Stevens (another prominent steam engineer of the day), much of which had previously appeared in the journal The Medical Repository and to which now Evans added various additional criticisms of Stevens' contentions. Evans concludes his book by renouncing inventing and any further work on his designs, complaining of the ingratitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> <b>and</b> the unprofitability of the endeavour, although this would prove to be just one of many such assertions by Evans over the coming years. Regardless, the Steam Engineer's Guide proved to be a popular work, though not on the same scale as his guide to milling, however it was the first book in the United States to make accessible to anyone ideas and techniques for steam engineering.|$|E

At {{the start of the}} Brooks fight, as Dyer was getting into the ring, he was handed a telegram informing him that he had been appointed as a boxing instructor for the National Army. Dyer had been refused admission into the British and American Armies on account of the broken cartilage in his right knee. Dyer was eventually based at Camp Grant in Illinois, but fought one more bout, a win over Walter Butler of Boston before beginning his commission. Dyer did not fight outside the armed forces {{during the rest of the}} war, but he proved successful in his role as camp boxing instructor with Camp Grant performing well in boxing tournaments.

5|$|Over {{the next}} decade the house was {{likely to have been}} let, as Maria Davenport {{preferred}} to live elsewhere. Her eldest son, William Davenport Davenport married firstly to Camilla Maria Gatt, then secondly to Diana Handley, whom he lived with at Bramall for four years before the estate was passed to him. Maria moved to London where she lived with her youngest son, Charles, and died in 1866. During William's tenure Bramall was regularly visited by members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>and</b> the Chapel continued to be used for regular services of worship. However, following his death in 1869, the property was let to Wakefield Christy of Christys & Co Hatting, therefore ending direct involvement from the Davenport family. This occurred because William's son, John, was too young to inherit the estate. John's whereabouts during Christy's seven-year tenure is unknown, though he was shown as a visitor at Bramall in 1871, and in 1874 became the first chairman of the Bramhall School Board. In 1876, shortly before he returned to the house, he was listed as living on Ack Lane in Bramhall.|$|E
