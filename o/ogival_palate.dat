40|$|Cornelia de Lange is {{a genetic}} {{syndrome}} which affects between 1 / 10. 000 and 1 / 60. 000 neonates, but its genetic bases {{are still not}} clear. Its principal clinical characteristics are the delay in growth and development, hirsute, structural anomalies in the limbs and distinctive facial characteristic. Dental problems are frequent and include: <b>ogival</b> <b>palate,</b> micrognathia, dental malalignment, delayed teething, microdontic teeth, periodontal disease and dental erosion produced by gastric reflux. Discussed {{is the case of}} a 29 year old patient affected by the syndrome in question, which presents the principal clinical characteristics. The patient?s general state of health is acceptable, without cardiac or respiratory alterations. The intraoral exploration shows policaries, periodontal disease, persistence of the temporal teeth and ectopic molars. After completing the necessary pre-operatory preparations, the entire odontological treatment was carried out under general aesthesia, due to the patient?s total lack of collaboration...|$|E
40|$|Trabalho completo: acesso restrito, p. 1780 – 1785 Objective Obstructive {{sleep apnea}} {{syndrome}} (OSAS) in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients {{may be associated}} with the presence of upper airway obstruction caused by chronic infection and nasal polyposis that may also contribute to OSAS severity. Our objective was to identify the profile of findings in CF and OSAS patients by performing upper airway examinations. Methodology Observational, cross-sectional study involving 63 children and adolescents between the ages of 2 and 14 with CF. All patients answered a questionnaire and underwent a standard otolaryngology examination, including an endoscopic nasal and nocturnal polysomnography. OSAS diagnosis was confirmed if the obstructive apnea index was ≥ 1. Results OSAS was identified in 35 (55. 6 %) patients. The upper airway findings were evaluated using multiple correspondence factorial analysis. The OSAS group presented with overjet > 2 mm, enlarged pharyngeal pillars, palatine tonsils and pharyngeal tonsils hypertrophy, <b>ogival</b> hard <b>palates</b> and characteristics of chronic rhinosinusitis. Conclusion Bone and soft tissue structural alterations of the upper airway and chronic rhinosinusitis were associated with the OSAS group patients...|$|R
40|$|Fragile X {{syndrome}} (FXS) {{is a rare}} {{variant of}} special health-care need demonstrating delayed developmental milestones and associated with intellectual and emotional disabilities ranging from learning problem to mental retardation. The syndrome is usually not diagnosed until 8 – 9 years of age since the clinical manifestations of the syndrome are greatly attenuated in childhood. The physical characteristics such as facial features, hyperactivity, attention deficit, autistic behavior, and macroorchidism are quite evident in younger age group. The most typical orofacial characteristics associated with children suffering from FXS are mandibular prominence, <b>ogival,</b> and cleft <b>palate.</b> Till date, very few dental literatures have been reported regarding the association of FXS with orodental anomalies. Here, we report a rare case of 14 -year-old boy suffering from FXS with typical orofacial characteristics, multiple supernumerary teeth, and dental caries...|$|R
40|$|AIM OF THE WORK: The fragile-X {{syndrome}} {{is the most}} common cause of inherited mental retardation and it is associated with the FMR 1 gene on X chromosome. The origin of anatomic anomalies of maxillo-facial complex is still discussed in literature. The authors describe the syndrome and report a clinical case. METHODS: Genetical and clinical aspects and the incidence of caries, periodontal disease and occlusal abrasion are reviewed. Occlusal conditions, particularly openbite and crossbite, are considered. RESULTS: The incidence of fragile-X {{syndrome is}} 1 : 2000 in males and 1 : 4000 in females, despite this the syndrome is diagnosed with a lot of difficulties yet, because of extreme variability of the phenomenological aspects. Patients often show severe mental retardation, linked to a peculiar profile of cognitive, behavioural, and emotional dysfunction and to distinctive anatomic features, which become more evident after puberty. Concerning oral characteristics, it doesn't seem to be a significant association between the syndrome and the incidence of caries or periodontal diseases, while an <b>ogival</b> shaped <b>palate</b> is peculiar. CONCLUSIONS: Literature review suggests that when male patients with severe mental retardation without well-known cause are visited, the ipothesis of X-fragile syndrome should be considered. Even though the diagnostic hypothesis may arise from the observation of typical somatic features, the diagnosis can be confirmed only by genetical test...|$|R
40|$|Objective: A {{number of}} studies have {{evaluated}} the oral health of patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), though most have involved children, and no specific oral manifestations have been described. The present study describes the buccodental disorders and hygiene habits in a group of adults with ASD. Study Design: A prospective case-control study was made of a group of patients with ASD (n= 30), {{with a mean age of}} 27. 7 ± 5. 69 years, and of a healthy age- and gender-matched control group (n= 30). An evaluation was made of the medical history, medication, oral hygiene habits and oral diseases, with determination of the CAOD, CAOS and OHI-S oral hygiene scores. Results: Most of the patients in the ASD group used two or more drugs and were assisted in brushing 2 - 3 times a day. The most frequent manifestations were bruxism, self-inflicted oral lesions and certain malocclusions. The CAOD and CAOS scores were significantly lower than in the controls. Conclusions: Adults with ASD and assisted dental hygiene presented fewer caries than the non-disabled population. However, bruxism, <b>ogival</b> <b>palate</b> and anterior open bite were frequent in the patients with ASD. Key words:Autism spectrum disorder, caries, dental hygiene, oral manifestations...|$|E
40|$|Background: It is {{important}} to establish an early diagnosis of the Marfan Syndrome (MFS) for providing an adequate pharmacological or surgical therapy. Nevertheless, this diagnosis may be complex, given the multi-organic involvement of this disease. Aims: In this work, we evaluated the oral phenotype {{in a group of}} paediatric patients with a clinical diagnosis of MFS, to quantify the association of the oro-facial defects with other systemic alterations. Settings and Design: Paediatric subjects who were aged, with a clinical diagnosis of MFS, were selected from our regional Marfan monitoring unit. Methods and Material: All the patients were subjected to Paediatric Dentistry examinations and a radiological screening with Panoramic and Cephalometric X-Rays. The aortic dilation (Aortic Z-score value), the hyperlaxity of the ligaments and scoliosis were evaluated by cardio-surgical and orthopaedics specialists. Statistical Analysis: The correlations between the oral and systemic alterations were analyzed by using the chi square test for the nominal variables. Results and Conclusions: We found a significant correlation of the Aortic Z - score with multiple oral defects which included retrognathia, malar hypoplasia, cross bite, oral respiration and an <b>ogival</b> <b>palate.</b> An association of the oral defects with hyperlaxity of the ligaments and scoliosis was also found. Thus, the data suggested that dentists should be more involved in a multidisciplinary approach, to provide an early MFS diagnosis in paediatric patients...|$|E
40|$|A 3 -year-old {{girl was}} {{admitted}} to the Emergency Department for the onset of severe abdominal pain a week after acute gastroenteritis. Abdominal X-ray and ultrasound showed a left-sided liver without signs of invagination or obstruction. A new abdominal ultrasound, repeated after 24 h due to the persistence of the abdominal pain, identified the liver on the right side. Abdominal CT showed that the liver was on the right side when the patient was supine and, on the left side when she was in left lateral decubitus. The condition was diagnosed as ‘Wandering Liver’ (WL). Abdominal pains spontaneously regressed within 48 h. On physical examination joint hyperlaxity and <b>ogival</b> <b>palate</b> were observed. Considering the spontaneous regression of symptoms, a “wait and see” approach was decided. After one year follow-up, the child is in good clinical condition and completely asymptomatic. WL is a rare condition characterized by excessive mobility of the liver {{due to the lack of}} normal hepatic fixation. Clinical presentation is variable from incidental finding to recurrent abdominal pain which may be severe suggesting a colonic obstruction. WL may be associated with a redundant colon that can be interposed between liver and diaphragm leading to bowel obstruction. Serial abdominal xrays and ultrasounds show the different position of the liver that may be confirmed by dynamic computed tomography and MRI. While a “wait and see” approach with a close follow-up is suggested for asymptomatic patients, surgery is necessary in case of bowel obstruction...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: This {{paper has}} {{evaluated}} the dental and or facial disorders associated to Goldblatt syndrome, {{also known as}} odontochondrodysplasia. AIM: We report the analysis performed on a female young patient affected by this disease. We analyzed her dental and or facial features. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We adopted several diagnostic criteria: firstly, we performed radiographic investigations, followed by rhinomanometric measurements and by clinical analysis performed {{in order to determine}} the salivary flow in this typology of patients. The evidences obtained after a careful clinical, anamnestic, and radiographic analysis of our female patient allowed us to identify a number of odontostomatologic features, which are very likely to be related to this syndrome. Our patient showed some pathognomonic signs of odontochondrodysplasia already identified in the literature, that is, pectus carinatum, joint hyperextensibility, coxa valga and genu valgum, upper and lower limb asymmetry, and vertebral abnormalities. Moreover, we focused our attention on those odontostomatologic aspects that had never been analyzed by other reports in the literature: dentinogenesis imperfecta, ligamentous hyperlaxity of all joints and of temporomandibular joints in particular, poor lip competence, <b>ogival</b> <b>palate,</b> and oral respiration. Besides these, dental crowding and other important elements were identified through cephalometric measurements. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: In the light of all these elements and of their comparison with the existing literature, it is possible to stereotype a few recurrent odontostomatologic and systemic-generalized features in patients with odontochondrodysplasia, which can be considered as closely associated with this syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Rare {{diseases}} (RD) {{are those}} that present a lower prevalence than 5 cases per 10. 000 population. The main objective of this review was to study the effect on oral health in rare diseases, while the secondary objective {{of the study is}} theme upgrade. Comparative observational case-control studies were analysed and a systematic review was conducted in PubMed. Each rare disease listed on the statistical data record of the Health Portal of the Ministry of Equality, Health and Social Policies Board of Andalusia was associated with ?oral health?. The variables studied included dental, oral mucosa and occlusion alterations, oral pathologies (caries, periodontal disease) and other alterations (mouth breathing, parafunctional habits, etc). A bias analysis of the variable caries was conducted. Six RD were selected through our inclusion and exclusion criteria (hypogammaglobulinemia, Rett syndrome, Marfan syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, cystic fibrosis and Cri du chat syndrome) in a total of 8 publications, of which four trials were classified as high risk of bias and one of them as medium risk. There were not trials with low risk of bias. The main statistically significant differences found by Syndrome compared to a control group were in Hypogammaglobulinemia with a greater tendency to enamel hypoplasia and dry mouth. The Rett syndrome had, as well, a greater tendency to an anterior open bite, <b>ogival</b> <b>palate,</b> bruxism, mouth breathing and tongue thrusting. Prader-Willi syndrome had a tendency of dental erosion, and Cri du chat syndrome showed a higher association to Tannerella forsythia...|$|E
40|$|P>Objective Congenital hypogonadotropic {{hypogonadism}} with anosmia (Kallmann syndrome) or with normal {{sense of smell}} is a heterogeneous genetic disorder caused by defects in the synthesis, secretion and action of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Mutations involving autosomal genes {{have been identified in}} approximately 30 % of all cases of {{hypogonadotropic hypogonadism}}. However, most studies that screened patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism for gene mutations did not include gene dosage methodologies. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether patients without detected point mutation carried a heterozygous deletion of one or more exons. Measurements We used the multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay to evaluate the potential contribution of heterozygous deletions of FGFR 1, GnRH 1, GnRHR, GPR 54 and NELF genes in the aetiology of GnRH deficiency. Patients We studied a mutation-negative cohort of 135 patients, 80 with Kallmann syndrome and 55 with normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Results One large heterozygous deletion involving all FGFR 1 exons was identified in a female patient with sporadic normosmic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and mild dimorphisms as <b>ogival</b> <b>palate</b> and cavus foot. FGFR 1 hemizygosity was confirmed by gene dosage with comparative multiplex and real-time PCRs. Conclusions FGFR 1 or other autosomal gene deletion is a possible but very rare event and does not account for a significant number of sporadic or inherited cases of isolated GnRH deficiency.
