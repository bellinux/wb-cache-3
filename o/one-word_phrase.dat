40|$|Several {{evidence-based}} procedures {{based upon}} operant learning principles {{have been developed}} to teach language, and for young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), naturalistic interventions are commonly implemented as they are both effective and developmentally appropriate. The current investigation compared contingent responsive intervention and combined intervention on the effects of language use in four children diagnosed with ASD. Results suggest that a combined intervention procedure increases target language and requests in children with simplified language (e. g., <b>one-word</b> <b>phrase)</b> as well as complex language (e. g., simple sentences) ...|$|E
40|$|Lexical entailment, such as hyponymy, is a {{fundamental}} issue in the semantics of natural language. This paper proposes distributional semantic models which efficiently learn word embeddings for entailment, using a recently-proposed framework for modelling entailment in a vector-space. These models postulate a latent vector for a pseudo-phrase containing two neighbouring word vectors. We investigate both modelling words as the evidence they contribute about this phrase vector, or as the posterior distribution of a <b>one-word</b> <b>phrase</b> vector, and find that the posterior vectors perform better. The resulting word embeddings outperform the best previous results on predicting hyponymy between words, in unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments. Comment: 8 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

He sometimes pines the days when his children were young, and has a way with babies. However, he is mostly a stoic person, and often shows no emotion and speaks mostly <b>one-word</b> <b>phrases.</b>|$|R

It was implemented in C ++, using object classes that reflect linguistic concepts and thus facilitate {{the transfer of}} linguistic intuitions into code. The parser first chunks morphemes into <b>one-word</b> <b>phrases</b> and then parses from the right to the left. The average parsing accuracy is 83. 6 %...|$|R

"Audience" [...] was {{her third}} song to {{incorporate}} an English–language phrase, alongside her single [...] "Whatever" [...] (February 1999) and the b–side to [...] "Love (Destiny)", [...] "Love: Since 1999" [...] (May 1999).

40|$|Cal was a 5 -year-old {{with autism}} who {{attended}} an inclusive preschool class {{for children with}} disabilities and their peers. Cal’s teacher, Mrs. Garner, often observed him in the dramatic play area with his classmates. He spoke infrequently using <b>one-word</b> <b>phrases</b> (e. g., “monkey”); however, he appeared interested in interacting with his peers and would often stand close to them and put his head on their shoulders. He often made requests by pointing and grunting. Mrs. Garner wanted to find a way for him to interact in a more appropriate way with the other 5 -year-olds...|$|R
