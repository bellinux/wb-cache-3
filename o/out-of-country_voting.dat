Each political party is {{represented on the}} council by its National Chairmen. The primary objective of the council is to ensure compliance with Political Parties Code of Conduct {{and to work with}} the Independent National Electoral Commission to ensure free, fair and credible elections in Nigeria.

The Supreme Judicial Committee for Elections (SJCE) accordingly approved a system for <b>out-of-country</b> <b>voting</b> that was implemented in the Parliamentary Elections 2011 / 2012. ‘Postal Voting ’ was chosen for the process. The Committee's choice of the voting system was done in an exceptionally short period of time and under considerable pressure. It was therefore crucial to examine the system that has already been adopted and implemented. It was also vital to decide which of the four main external voting options (Postal – Personal – Proxy- Electronic), or which combination of them, is the most suitable for the future Egyptian elections.
