40|$|The {{research}} evaluates <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Framework <b>Agreements</b> on Telework and Work-related Stress in Belgium, Denmark, UK, and Czech Republic and in {{the banking}} and local Government sectors within these countries. Further, it evaluates the various factors that explain divergent implementation outcomes in countries and sectors. It develops two benchmarks to assess <b>the</b> efficacy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agreements</b> as modes <b>of</b> European social partner ‘soft’ law governance; a benchmark that assesses <b>the</b> procedural implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agreements,</b> and a benchmark that assess <b>the</b> substantive implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agreements.</b> A multi-level governance theoretical approach is also adopted. It emerged that ‘effective’ procedural implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agreements</b> largely occurred in Belgium and Czech Republic, but did not occur {{to the same degree}} in Denmark and UK. It also emerged that <b>the</b> substantive effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agreements</b> was patchy and that <b>the</b> substantive impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Telework <b>Agreement</b> was greater than that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Work-related Stress <b>Agreement.</b> Although structural factors were important in explaining divergent implementation outcomes, it also emerged that it was primarily policy and actor related factors that explained divergent national and sectoral implementation outcomes. The research ends with a rather skeptical evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Agreements</b> as modes <b>of</b> European social partner ‘soft’ law governance.
