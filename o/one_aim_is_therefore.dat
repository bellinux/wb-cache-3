40|$|The two monogenean species G. salaris and G. thymalli, {{are almost}} {{identical}} at the nuclear molecular level. There {{is also no}} support from mtDNA (cox 1) sequences for monophyly of all G. salaris or G. thymalli haplotypes. It has therefore been suggested that these taxa represent a case of incipient speciation. Based on this, whether ultimately considered one or more species, these taxa together {{are referred to as}} the G. salaris / G. thymalli species complex. It is argued in the present thesis that a total-evidence approach to the taxonomy of the G. salaris / G. thymalli species complex is at lower risk of oversimplifying the taxonomic conclusions than is a single-criterion approach for species delimitation. <b>One</b> <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> to apply a comprehensive all-inclusive approach to the taxonomy of the G. salaris / G. thymalli species complex. The morphology of the opisthaptoral hard-parts, is considered taxonomically informative, and therefore representing a non-linear approach to taxonomy in Gyrodactylus. However, traditional linear measurements are not necessarily the optimal approach in studies of morphology. Furthermore, environmental factors may influence on the size and possibly also the shape of the opisthaptoral hard-parts. Accordingly, one aim in the present thesis is to improve the methodology in studies of systematics in Gyrodactylus based on morphology. In the analytical approach to study morphology, shape descriptors from studies of geometric morphometrics proved to work well. It is therefore reasonable to assume that in future studies the application of geometric shape descriptors is justified. The presented results indicated that taxonomic revisions in the G. salaris / G. thymalli species complex based on a single species criterion, despite advantages of comparability, are unlikely to lead to an overall satisfactory delimitation of species. All methods applied so far for assessing the taxonomy and systematics of the G. salaris / G. thymalli species complex document the importance of evolutionary relationship as the absolute basic grouping criterion. However, for example species definition exclusively based on mtDNA sequence data fails to reflect the significant differences in host preferences and pathogenicity. It is therefore concluded that the knowledge of phylogenetic relationships in the species complex should be supplemented with information on morphology and even more important, on ecology, when it comes to defining the boundaries between the taxa, whether on a species level or below...|$|E
40|$|The chief aim of {{my thesis}} is {{to study and}} analyse how the {{multiculturalism}} of schools is reflected in research and reports in Sweden {{and in the way}} in which teachers talk about multicultural issues at school. Part of the work is done in the form of reflecting talks with two groups of teachers in two different schools on issues and situations taken from their own everyday experience. The talks are conducted over two years. <b>One</b> partial <b>aim</b> <b>is</b> <b>therefore</b> to study whether this working method can help teachers to develop their strategies with regard to multicultural issues at school. I describe how the talks develop over two years in an ethnically heterogeneous group of teachers in one of the schools, some areas related to multicultural issues in the school that the teachers find problematic, and how the talks to some extent influence the teachers’ choice of strategies in the school’s practice. Part of the work is an analysis of a talk from each group of teachers and their conceptions of “the immigrant pupil” and her/his parents are focused on. The analytical tool of interpretive repertoires is used to visualise patterns of common points of departure and values in the talks. Also part of the work is an analysis of how research and reports reflect the discourse on multicultural issues from 1980 to 2005. I emphasise some themes and how these change over time. Through the study, parts of the content of the discourse about the multicultural Swedish education are made visible. The discourse contains expressions of a focus on shortcomings and problems that are regarded as linked to pupils, parents and to some extent to teachers with foreign backgrounds. The discourse also contains expressions of seeing differences, chiefly between groups of pupils with foreign and ethnic Swedish backgrounds respectively. By focusing on differences and shortcomings a boundary is at the same time set up between “us” and “them”. The composition of teachers in Swedish schools is relatively homogeneous as regards ethnicity. When, in addition, it is many times teachers that have the responsibility and power to define what are seen as problems and to find solutions in schools’ practice, the problems and solutions are often defined from a majority perspective. It is also from a majority perspective that decisions are made about to what extent, to what degree and in what way minority perspectives should be represented in these contexts. It is a matter of who has the power to define themselves and the others and the others’ shortcomings...|$|R
40|$|Product {{testing and}} {{development}} are essential parts {{in sports and}} for the athletes {{in their quest to}} reach the podium. Manufacturers of sports equipment often use basic test methods which do not test the equipment in a sports specific way. Much of the equipment used by world-class athletes is chosen based only on subjective tests and the athletes’ feelings. <b>One</b> short term <b>aim</b> <b>was</b> <b>therefore</b> to develop test methods for objective tests of sports equipment that also tested the equipment in a sports  specific  way.  Another  aim  was  to  integrate  mechanics  and  simulations  to  enhance  the understanding of the test results. The more long term <b>aims</b> <b>are</b> to contribute to increased theoretical knowledge regarding test methods for sports equipment and to {{contribute to the development of}} test  methods  to  create  new  and  better  sports  equipment.  Experimental  tests  combined  with simulations  can  give  valuable  information  to  improve  the  performance  and  safety  of  sports equipment. Three studies dealt with the issue of objective yet sport specific test methods for sports equipment. The main methodological advancement is the modification of established test methods together  with  conventional  mechanics  calculations.  New  test  devices  and  methodologies  are proposed for alpine ski helmets and cross-country ski poles. Suggestions are given for improved test setups as well as theoretical simulation are introduced for glide tests of skis. The results show how sport   specific   test   methodologies   together   with   theoretical   calculations   can   improve   the objectiveness and relevance when testing sports equipment. However, the collected and used data require high precision to obtain high accuracy in the simulations. High data accuracy can be an issue in field measurements but also due to manufacturers not disclosing key material data. Still, the used methods  and  calculations  in  this  thesis  produce  relevant  and  reliable  results  which  can  be implemented to accurate evaluations of different sports equipment. Even though it has not been a first priority aim in this work, the results from the alpine helmet study have been used by helmet manufacturers to design new helmets with increased safety properties. This further show how an objective and sport specific test approach together with theoretical simulation can improve sports equipment and in the longer perspective, also the athletes’ performances.   QC 20140423 </p...|$|R
