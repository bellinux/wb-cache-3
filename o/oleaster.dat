Higher altitude villages grow barley, peas, and vegetables, and have one species of willow (called Drokchang in Ladakhi). Lower villages also grow wheat, alfalfa, mustard for oil, grapes, and {{a greater variety of}} vegetables. Cultivated trees in lower villages include apricots, apples, mulberries, walnuts, balsam poplars, Afghan poplars, <b>oleaster</b> (Elaeagnus angustifolia), and several species of willow (difficult to identify, and local names vary). Elms and white poplars are found in the Nubra Valley, and one legendary specimen of white poplar grows in Alchi in the Indus Valley. Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia), Himalayan cypress and horse chestnut have been introduced since the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|... c) Janus's cultic {{alliances and}} {{relations}} in Latium would show a Prelatin character. Janus has no association in cult (calendar or prayer formulae) {{with any other}} entity. Even though he bears the epithet of Pater he is no head of a divine family; however some testimonies lend him a companion, sometimes female, and a son and/or a daughter. They belong {{to the family of}} the nymphs or genies of springs. Janus intervenes in the miracle of the hot spring during the battle between Romulus and Tatius: Juturna and the nymphs of the springs are clearly related to Janus as well as Venus, that in Ovid's Metamorphoses cooperates in the miracle and may have been confused with Venilia, or perhaps the two might have been originally one. Janus has a direct link only to Venilia, with whom he fathered Canens. The magic role of the wild olive tree (<b>oleaster)</b> is prominent in the description of the duel between Aeneas and Turnus reflecting its religious significance and powers: it was sacred to sailors, also those who had shipwrecked as a protecting guide to the shore. It was probably venerated by a Prelatin culture in association with Faunus. In the story of Venulus coming back from Apulia too one may see the religious connotation of the wild olive: the king discovers one into which a local shepherd had been turned for failing to respect the nymphs he had come across in a nearby cavern, apparently Venilia, who was the deity associated with the magic virtues of such tree. Gagé finds it remarkable that the characters related to Janus are in the Aeneis {{on the side of the}} Rutuli. In the poem Janus would be represented by Tiberinus. Olistene, the daughter of Janus with Camese, may reflect in her name that of the olive or <b>oleaster,</b> or of Oreithyia. Camese may be reflected in Carmenta: Evander's mother is from Arcadia, comes to Latium as an exile migrant and has her two festivals in January: Camese's name at any rate does not look Latin.|$|E

40|$|The {{location}} {{and timing of}} domestication of the olive tree, a key crop in Early Mediterranean societies, remain hotly debated. Here, we unravel the history of wild olives (<b>oleasters),</b> and then infer the primary origins of the domesticated olive. Phylogeography and Bayesian molecular dating analyses based on plastid genome profiling of 1263 <b>oleasters</b> and 534 cultivated genotypes reveal three main lineages of pre-Quaternary origin. Regional hotspots of plastid diversity, species distribution modelling and macrofossils support the existence of three long-term refugia; namely the Near East (including Cyprus), the Aegean area and the Strait of Gibraltar. These ancestral wild gene pools have provided the essential foundations for cultivated olive breeding. Comparison of the geographical pattern of plastid diversity between wild and cultivated olives indicates the cradle of first domestication in the northern Levant followed by dispersals across the Mediterranean basin in parallel with the expansion of civilizations and human exchanges {{in this part of}} the world...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} is to investigate the effect of harvest date and crop year on the chemical composition and quality of virgin olive oils extracted from fruits of seven selected <b>oleasters.</b> This study showed that changes in olive oil characteristics are due mainly to fruit maturity while crop season have minor incidence. The majority of the analytical parameters, i. e., peroxide value, UV absorption at 270 nm, phenols, pigments, decreased during ripening, whereas oil content, free acidity and linoleic acid level increased. In general, the antioxidants and the related parameters decreased as olive fruit ripened...|$|R

PESTOLIVE aims at producing knowledge and tools for a new and efficient management ofplant-parasitic nematodes (PPN) and plant-pathogenic fungi (PPF) in olive (Olea europaea L.) cropping systems and nurseries, while reducing the use of pesticides. Because of the anthropiccontinuum from Olea post-glacial refuges to <b>Oleasters</b> (domestication) and then to olive-trees(breeding and cropping), the fragmentation of the PPN and PPF communities and of theirnatural enemies could explain the scattered diversity of the control techniques (especiallyresistance rootstocks, biocontrol, cropping strategies) developed and applied all around theMediterranean Basin. The novelty of PESTOLIVE is based on: i) the analysis and themanagement of the parasite diversity (ecology of communities) instead of controllingemblematic species (population approach), and ii) the involvement of knowledge about thehistorical co-adaptation of soil-borne parasite and natural enemies communities to olive-treedomestication (origins and past assemblages) and breeding that follows the history of O. europaea around the Mediterranean Basin...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims : This study {{examines}} {{the pattern of}} genetic variability and genetic relationships of wild olive (Olea europaea subsp. europaea var. sylvestris) populations in the north-western Mediterranean. Recent bottleneck events are also assessed and an investigation is made of the underlying population structure of the wild olive populations. Methods : The genetic variation within and between 11 wild olive populations (171 individuals) was analysed with eight microsatellite markers. Conventional and Bayesian-based analyses were applied to infer genetic structure and define the number of gene pools in wild olive populations. Key Results : Bayesian model-based clustering identified four gene pools, which was in overall concordance with the Factorial Correspondence Analysis and Fitch–Margoliash tree. Two gene pools were predominantly found in southern Spain and Italian islands, respectively, in samples gathered from undisturbed forests of the typical Mediterranean climate. The other two gene pools were mostly detected in the north-eastern regions of Spain and in continental Italy and belong to the transition region between the temperate and Mediterranean climate zones. Conclusions : On {{the basis of these}} results, it can be assumed that the population structure of wild olives from the north-western Mediterranean partially reflects the evolutionary history of these populations, although hybridization between true <b>oleasters</b> and cultivated varieties in areas of close contact between the two forms must be assumed as well. The study indicates a degree of admixture in all the populations, and suggests some caution regarding genetic differentiation at the population level, making it difficult to identify clear-cut genetic boundaries between candidate areas containing either genuinely wild or feral germplasm...|$|R
