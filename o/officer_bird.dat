50|$|As a {{judicial}} <b>officer,</b> <b>Bird</b> had acquired insight into land ownership in India, {{and the impact}} on it of the legal framework. On his appointment as a revenue commissioner, he made a reputation, {{and when it was}} decided in 1833 to revise the settlement of the land revenue of the North-Western Provinces, Lord William Bentinck, the governor-general, chose Bird. Retaining his seat as a member of board of revenue recently constituted at Allahabad, he took sole charge of the settlement operations, which he brought to completion by the end of 1841. The conclusions were stated in a major report. Bird retired from the service in 1842, and was succeeded on the board of revenue by James Thomason.|$|E
50|$|AVI {{is governed}} by a Board of Directors, Chief Executive <b>Officer</b> Paul <b>Bird,</b> and a Senior Management Team.|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of the Whitehaven shootings, {{residents}} there and in the neighbouring towns of Egremont and Seascale were immediately urged to stay indoors. A massive manhunt for Bird was launched by the Cumbria Constabulary, which was assisted by Civil Nuclear Constabulary <b>officers.</b> <b>Bird</b> proceeded to drive through several local towns, firing apparently at random, and calling a majority of the victims over to his taxi before shooting them.|$|R
60|$|I have {{sometimes}} thought, that this paradox of the Kingdom growing rich, is chiefly owing to those worthy gentlemen the BANKERS, who, except some custom-house <b>officers,</b> <b>birds</b> of passage, oppressive thrifty squires, {{and a few}} others that shall be nameless, are the only thriving people among us: And I have often wished that a law were enacted to hang up half a dozen bankers every year, and thereby interpose at least some short delay, to the further ruin of Ireland.|$|R
5000|$|Bird {{was born}} in 1951 in Eugene, Oregon. His father was a U.S. Foreign Service <b>officer,</b> and <b>Bird</b> spent his {{childhood}} in Jerusalem, Beirut, Dhahran, Cairo, and Mumbai. His father named him after Kai-Yu Hsu, a refugee from Communist China he met at the University of Oregon. Kai means [...] "mustard" [...] in Mandarin Chinese, and [...] "Kai-Yu" [...] suggests somebody who adds spice to life.|$|R
50|$|Soper {{joined the}} {{government}} service in 1934, {{becoming the first}} Federal Chief Migratory <b>Bird</b> <b>Officer</b> for the Prairie Provinces in the Canadian Wildlife Service. In 1948, he became the Chief Federal Wildlife Officer for Alberta, Northwest Territories and Yukon.|$|R
5000|$|Fort Anjediva and {{the island}} are located 4 km south of Baticala, Karwar. [...] Karwar is on National Highway NH 17. From Karwar, a 2 km {{causeway}} leads to the <b>Officers</b> Gate (Sea <b>Bird</b> gate), {{and then on to}} the historic fort.|$|R
5000|$|The Church on Anjadip Island {{is located}} 4 km, south of Baticala, the ancient kingdom of Garsopa, in present-day Karwar. Karwar is {{approached}} by the National Highway NH 17. From Karwar, a 2 km causeway {{leads to the}} <b>Officers</b> (Sea <b>Bird)</b> gate {{and then to the}} historic church. The church is also approachable by boat ride from the Binga beach. In the past, the approach involved a trip of one hour by trawler and then by canoe to the island.|$|R
5|$|On 9 February, two {{divisions}} of the Japanese Twenty Fifth Army, led by Lieutenant General Tomoyuki Yamashita, landed on the northwestern coast of Singapore, in the Sarimbun area. Yamashita's headquarters (HQ) was in the Sultan of Johor's palace on Istana Bukit Serene, which offered him and his <b>officers</b> a <b>bird's</b> eye view of virtually every key target in the northern sector of Singapore Island, only 1.6 kilometres (one mile) across the Straits of Johor. Sultan Ibrahim's palace was not fired upon by the British because any damage caused would have extensive repercussions for British-Johor ties.|$|R
5000|$|Two O-1 Bird Dogs were loaned to the Australian Army's 161 Reconnaissance Flight {{operating}} out of Nui Dat in Phuoc Tuy province. One was lost to ground fire in May 1968, killing 161's commanding <b>officer.</b> Another <b>Bird</b> Dog was built by this unit's maintenance crew, using aircraft sections salvaged from dumps around Vietnam. It was test-flown and later smuggled back to Australia in pieces, contained in crates marked as [...] "aircraft spares". This aircraft now resides in the Museum of Army Flying at the Army Aviation Center at Oakey, Queensland.|$|R
5000|$|Conair's {{air attack}} aircraft, more {{commonly}} known as [...] "bird dogs", are aircraft that contain the pilot and Air Attack <b>Officer.</b> The <b>bird</b> dogs ensure the runs {{to be made by}} the laden airtankers are safe and free of obstructions. The crew inside the bird dog determine the run locations and drop types to be made, coordinate the aerial action with the ground crews if present and control the airspace around the fire. The attack aircraft are Piper PA-60 Aerostars, Rockwell Turbo Commanders, and Cessna 208 Caravans. These aircraft are always used in conjunction with the airtankers.|$|R
5000|$|Goodwin was {{a writer}} and {{contributor}} to Avicultural Magazine. By chance, in July 1945, while Goodwin was still in active duty in the military, his purchase of back issues of Avicultural Magazine led {{to a series of}} unexpected events which led to his employment at the Natural History Museum. Though he had no formal education in ornithology at the time, Goodwin was hired to work in the Natural History Museum's bird room. He eventually rose up through the ranks to become principal scientific <b>officer</b> for <b>birds</b> at the museum. [...] In 1965 he participated in the third of the Harold Hall Australian ornithological collecting expeditions. He wrote a series of detailed books on crows, pigeons and estrildid finches during the 1970s and 1980s as part of his work at the British Museum. These works are still regarded as the definitive works on these particular birds today. [...] He also authored and published his favorite work, Birds in Man’s World, and wrote a series of children's books and pamphlets on birds.|$|R
50|$|Captain Isaac Ruddell (1737-January 1812) was an 18th-century American Virginia State Line officer {{during the}} American Revolutionary War and a Kentucky frontiersman. He was an officer {{commanding}} a company under BGEN George Rogers Clark (1777-1782). He was {{the founder of}} Ruddell's Station, {{one of the earliest}} settlements in Bourbon County, Kentucky. He founded another settlement also known as Ruddell's Station, or fort, on the site of an abandoned fort on the Licking River in present-day Harrison County, Kentucky. During the Revolutionary War, the settlement was destroyed by a joint Canadian and Shawnee party under British <b>officer</b> Captain Henry <b>Bird</b> in 1780. He and his family were held prisoner in Detroit for over two years before their release.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II, {{he served}} in the Office of Strategic Services, the {{predecessor}} of the Central Intelligence Agency, and was in charge of American intelligence services in Southeast Asia. [...] He trained many Indonesian spies, all of whom were killed during the war. An article in the August 26, 1950 New Yorker said that Ripley reversed the usual pattern, where spies posed as ornithologists in order to gain access to sensitive areas, and instead used his position as an intelligence <b>officer</b> to go <b>birding</b> in restricted areas. The government of Thailand gave him a national award for his support of the Thai underground during the war. While serving in the OSS he met his future wife Mary Livingston and her roommate Julia Child.|$|R
500|$|Before {{the crash}} Michael worked with his long-time partner, Detective Isaiah Freeman (known to his LAPD team as [...] "Bird)". After the accident, Michael is {{assigned}} to Detective Efrem Vega in the [...] "red reality." [...] Vega was previously an <b>officer,</b> when <b>Bird</b> {{was transferred to the}} western division to work with Detective Ed Hawkins. In the [...] "green reality," [...] Michael stays with Bird and Efrem remains an officer. While working on cases in both realities, Michael begins to realize that the details of one case can help him with another case in the other reality. Due to this, he often clashes with his partners (who are unaware of this). Rex and Hannah grieve each other's death after the accident, coping in different ways: In the [...] "red reality" [...] Hannah begins to redecorate the house, while in the [...] "green reality" [...] Rex begins to play tennis with Hannah's former partner Tara. In [...] "Turtles All the Way Down", in a dream Michael sees Hannah at a restaurant. He was [...] "dreaming while he was dreaming", and Hannah told Michael to give her [...] "one last kiss goodbye". This causes Dr. Evans to note that Michael realizes the [...] "green reality" [...] is life. However, soon afterwards Michael sees Rex and Hannah together and is happy.|$|R
5000|$|Ogden had {{frequent}} {{run-ins with}} the rival HBC employees {{and engaged in}} physical violence on several occasions. In 1816, HBC clerks reported that Ogden killed an Indian who had traded with the Hudson's Bay Company. The Indian was [...] "butchered in a most cruel manner," [...] according to HBC <b>officer</b> James <b>Bird.</b> Although many in the North West Company viewed this as {{a necessary part of}} living in the Northwest, the HBC viewed Ogden as a dangerous man whose actions were deplorable, especially considering his background as the son of a judge. Ogden was charged with murder, and the North West Company moved him further west to attempt to avoid any further confrontations with the HBC. He served at different posts in modern-day Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia for the next several years.As a way of ending the ongoing strife between the two companies, the HBC and the North West Company merged in 1821. Ogden's violent history placed the now larger HBC in a quandary. The company management severely disliked and distrusted Ogden, but finally agreed that he had done no more than many others during the [...] "fur-trade wars." [...] He was promoted to the rank of Chief Trader in 1823, and put in charge of the Snake River Country of the HBC's Columbia Department Expedition.|$|R
50|$|In the Spring of 1779, he {{established}} a fortified settlement on the South fork of the Licking River known as Ruddell's Station (or Fort Liberty) in Harrison County one mile (1.6 km) from present-day Lair Station. The fort {{was built on the}} site of Hinkson's Station which was previously abandoned several years before. Along with Martin's Station, located on Stoner Creek near present-day Paris, the settlement became home to a large number of Pennsylvania German families over the next year. During the American Revolutionary War however, an Indian (including Shawnee) raiding party of 600 - 900 led by British <b>officer</b> Captain Henry <b>Bird</b> and 150 British soldiers left twenty+ settlers dead. The approx. 470 survivors, along with he and his wife (and captives from Martin's Station), were force marched to Detroit where they remained prisoners {{until the end of the}} war.|$|R
2500|$|Violence {{continued}} sporadically on O'Connell Street {{for another}} hour or so. The Gardaí, advancing from {{the northern end of}} the street gradually pushed the rioters back southwards. The most sustained violence took place around the General Post Office building, where the rioters initially sat down in protest and then, several of them having been batoned, regrouped behind burning barricades and threw rocks, paving slabs and one or possibly two petrol bombs at Gardaí. Several Gardaí, protesters and a number of journalists from RTÉ and TV3 were injured. RTÉ's chief news correspondent, Charlie Bird was singled out for attack by some rioters and was kicked and punched while being called an [...] "Orange bastard" [...] before being rescued by the Garda SDU <b>officers.</b> Charlie <b>Bird</b> {{had been a member of}} the Workers' Party of Ireland which had split from Sinn Féin in 1970 and was seen as highly critical of the Republican Movement. However some of the violence appeared to be entirely random in its targets. For instance several bystanders were attacked and a woman who was five months pregnant was punched in the stomach. The woman later sent a text message to NewsTalk 106 to thank the Gardaí and ambulance service who looked after her after the incident. In addition, the windows of several businesses, including Foot Locker, Schuh, and Ulster Bank near O'Connell Bridge, were smashed and at least one shop (Footlocker shoe shop) was looted. Among those arrested for looting this shop were a number of foreign nationals as well as locals – indicating that in the latter stages of the riot, much of the disturbances were opportunistic – inspired by vandalism or desire for theft rather than politically motivated.|$|R
5000|$|British losses {{had been}} heavy; the 100th Regiment, which held the center, {{was reduced to}} ...one Captain & 3 subalterns doing duty, with 250 {{effective}} men. The official casualty return gave 148 killed, 321 wounded and 46 missing. However, 20th century research by Canadian archivist Douglas Hendry has demonstrated that the British casualty return for Chippawa marked down many men as killed who had in fact been captured, and that of 136 British regulars {{who were supposed to}} have been killed, only 74 actually died. The official return gave 12 Canadian militiamen killed but Donald Graves has determined that 18 actually died. A U.S. Army document signed by Assistant Inspector-General Azariah Horne states the Americans had captured 3 officers and 72 [...] "rank and file" [...] of the British regulars who were wounded and 9 British regulars, 1 [...] "captain of the Indians", 1 Indian chief and 4 Indian warriors who were not wounded. Two British <b>officers,</b> Captains <b>Bird</b> and Wilson, appear in the official casualty list in the [...] "wounded" [...] category with additional information that they have also been taken prisoner. The actual British loss at Chippawa therefore appears to have been 74 regulars, 18 Canadian militiamen and 16 Indian warriors killed; 303 British regulars (not including Captains Bird and Wilson, who come under the 'wounded prisoners' category), 16 Canadian militiamen and an unknown number of Indian warriors wounded; 75 British regulars (including Captains Bird and Wilson) wounded and captured by the Americans; 9 British regulars, one officer of the British Indian Department and 5 Indian warriors taken prisoner unwounded. A further 9 British soldiers and 9 Canadian militiamen appear to have deserted. This gives a grand total of 108 killed, 319 wounded, 75 wounded prisoners, 15 unwounded prisoners and 18 missing.|$|R

5000|$|Freamon matches {{drug dealer}} Bodie Broadus' {{voice to a}} prior {{recording}} when he makes {{a phone call to}} his grandmother. This information is used as probable cause for a wiretap. With the wire up and running on Bodie, the unit soon has him talking in code about drugs to less disciplined colleagues who use names on the phone. Bodie is heard ordering a resupply for a dealer known as Tweety <b>Bird.</b> <b>Officer</b> Caroline Massey tells McNulty that the code remains similar to their other investigations apart from one word - Hamsterdam. She guesses that it {{may have something to do}} with the stash house. McNulty departs to meet up with Kima Greggs and observe Bodie's meeting with Tweety Bird. Daniels asks Pearlman to leave the room and tells his detectives the latest news about their suspended co-worker Roland [...] "Prez" [...] Pryzbylewski - internal investigations have become involved. Daniels has to ask Massey and Freamon if they ever faced racism from Prez. Massey and Freamon both claim no. When Daniels leaves, Massey wonders if Prez would have shot Waggoner if he were white, while Freamon defends Prez claiming the suspect they were looking for was a number one male (BPD police code for African American male).|$|R
50|$|During the {{remainder}} of the year there were several altercations among the officers of the regiment, a state of affairs which recurred throughout the regiment's existence. In March, 1778, Lt. Col. Bayard was charged with murdering one of his own <b>officers,</b> Lt. William <b>Bird.</b> Bayard was tried and found guilty of manslaughter in October, and sentenced to be suspended for three months and then removed from his command. This sentence was overturned on a technicality by the Judge Advocate General, but probably played a role in Bayard's subsequent difficulties in retaining his command. In August, Col. Innes received a letter from Edward Winslow in which he wrote: I have in free conversation suggested my opinion to you that the Corps of King's Orange Rangers is at present in a position peculiarly alarming -- Feuds and dissensions among the Officers -- Mutinies and Desertions among the men...Whether the present Commandant is not sufficiently experienc'd in military matters? Or whether by any other means there is in officers and men a want of that confidence in him which is essential to order & discipline in a new Corps I know not -- but from the variety of unhappy events which have of late taken place, I apprehend one or the other.I am sensible that on days of public parade -- such as Inspections and Musters -- there is not a provincial Corps in his Majesty's service more capable of distinguishing itself by a performance of military exercise & maneuvers than this -- nor is there a better body of men.|$|R
