2500|$|Microsoft SQL Server 2005 {{includes}} a component named SQL CLR ("Common Language Runtime") via which it integrates with [...]NET Framework. Unlike most other applications that use [...]NET Framework, SQL Server itself hosts the [...]NET Framework runtime, i.e., memory, threading and resource management requirements of [...]NET Framework are satisfied by SQLOS itself, {{rather than the}} underlying Windows operating system. SQLOS provides deadlock detection and resolution services for [...]NET code as well. With SQL CLR, stored procedures and triggers can be written in any managed [...]NET language, including C# and VB.NET. Managed code {{can also be used}} to define UDT's (user defined types), which can persist in the database. Managed code is compiled to CLI assemblies and after being verified for type safety, registered at the database. After that, they can be invoked like any <b>other</b> <b>procedure.</b> However, only a subset of the Base Class Library is available, when running code under SQL CLR.

A report from this lookout was what he hoped to elicit by the remark which he wished to make. He desired greatly to know whether Miss Roberta March looked upon him in the light of a lover, or in that of an intimate acquaintance, whose present intimacy depended a good deal upon the propinquity of Midbranch and the Green Sulphur Springs. He had endeavored to produce upon her mind the latter impression. If he ever wished her to regard him as a lover he could do this in the easiest and most straightforward way, but the <b>other</b> <b>procedure</b> was much more difficult, and he was not certain that he had succeeded in it. How to find out in what light she viewed him without allowing the lady to perceive his purpose was a very delicate operation.|$|E
