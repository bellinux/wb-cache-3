5|$|Acheson was {{particularly}} worried that allowing {{the details of}} the coup to go public would damage the image of the US. The Rio Pact of 1947 had created the Organization <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States,</b> or OAS, and this body had obtained jurisdiction over regional disputes from the United Nations. In order to achieve this, the US had also committed to a policy of non-intervention {{in the internal affairs of}} other countries. If PBFORTUNE had become public knowledge, the fact that the US was supporting an invasion of a country that was also a member of the OAS would have represented a huge setback to US policy. Thus the State Department promptly ended the operation when they became aware that its cover was blown.|$|E

5|$|The United States' {{occupation}} of Nicaragua and Haiti continued under his administration, but Coolidge withdrew American {{troops from the}} Dominican Republic in 1924. Coolidge led the U.S. delegation to the Sixth International Conference <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States,</b> January 15–17, 1928, in Havana, Cuba. This was the only international trip Coolidge made during his presidency. There, he extended an olive branch to Latin American leaders embittered over America's interventionist policies in Central America and the Caribbean. For 88 years {{he was the only}} sitting president to have visited Cuba, until Barack Obama did so in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{two leaders}} had a strong relationship, by 1960 US {{officials}} were becoming concerned by what they viewed as Canadian procrastination on vital issues, such as whether Canada should join the Organization <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States</b> (OAS). Talks on these issues in June 1960 produced little in results. Diefenbaker hoped that US Vice President Richard Nixon would win the 1960 US presidential election, but when Nixon's Democratic rival, Senator John F. Kennedy won the race, he sent Senator Kennedy a note of congratulations. Kennedy did not respond until Canadian officials asked {{what had become of}} Diefenbaker's note, two weeks later. Diefenbaker, for whom such correspondence was very meaningful, was annoyed at the President-elect's slowness to respond. In January 1961, Diefenbaker visited Washington to sign the Columbia River Treaty. However, with only days remaining in the Eisenhower administration, little else could be accomplished.|$|E

5|$|Cuba's {{economy grew}} in 1974 {{as a result}} of high {{international}} sugar prices and new credits with Argentina, Canada, and parts of Western Europe. A number of Latin American states called for Cuba's re-admittance into the Organization <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States</b> (OAS), with the U.S. finally conceding in 1975 on Henry Kissinger's advice. Cuba's government underwent a restructuring along Soviet lines, claiming that this would further democratization and decentralize power away from Castro. Officially announcing Cuba's identity as a socialist state, the first National Congress of the Cuban Communist Party was held, and a new constitution adopted that abolished the position of President and Prime Minister. Castro remained the dominant figure in governance, taking the presidency of the newly created Council of State and Council of Ministers, making him both head of state and head of government.|$|E
5|$|The United States is a {{founding}} member of the United Nations, World Bank, International Monetary Fund, Organization <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States</b> (OAS), and other international organizations. The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP. The U.S. economy is the fastest-growing in the Americas and is largely post-industrial, characterized by the dominance of services and knowledge-based activities, although the manufacturing sector remains the second-largest in the world. Though its population is only 4.3% of the world total, Americans hold 33.2% of the total wealth in the world, the largest share of global wealth concentrated in a single country. The United States ranks among the highest nations in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. The U.S. is the foremost military power in the world, making up a third of global military spending. It is also a global leader in science and technology.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} begins on November 3, 1966 with Guevara {{arriving}} in Bolivia {{disguised as a}} middle-aged representative of the Organization <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States</b> hailing from Uruguay, who subsequently drives into the mountains to meet his men. The film is organized {{by the number of}} days {{that he was in the}} country. On Day 26, there is solidarity among Guevara's men despite his status as a foreigner. By Day 67, Guevara, however, has been set up for betrayal. He tries to recruit some peasants only to be mistaken for a cocaine smuggler, and the Bolivian Communist Party, led by Mario Monje, refuse to support the armed struggle. On Day 100, there is a shortage of food and Guevara exercises discipline to resolve conflicts between his Cuban and Bolivian followers.|$|E

5|$|Up to 1990, Nicaragua {{had lived}} with forty years of the Somoza dictatorship, through a decade of civil warfare and Sandinista rule, and five years of US imposed {{economic}} sanctions. On 25 February 1990, Chamorro won the election with a 54.7% share of the vote, ousting the incumbent Ortega and becoming the first elected woman president in the Americas. Because the election {{was held in the}} midst of a civil war, it was important both domestically and internationally that the vote was seen to be legitimate. The Esquipulas Peace Agreement which had been brokered by Arias, called for monitoring of elections by the Organization <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States</b> and the United Nations, among other provisions. The election was the most strictly monitored of any in Latin America and involved 2,578 international observers among them former US President Jimmy Carter; Raul Alfonsín, former President of Argentina; Alfonso López Michelsen, former President of Colombia; Rodrigo Carazo Odio, former President of Costa Rica and many Caribbean and US dignitaries. Ortega and his supporters conceded defeat without argument and observers left only a skeleton staff to assist with the transition of power.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August 1936, the United States {{had made}} it known that it would follow a policy of non-intervention, but did not {{announce}} it officially. This isolationism on the Spanish war would later be identified as disastrous by Under-Secretary of State Sumner Welles. Five days later, the Glenn L. Martin Company enquired whether the government would allow the sale of eight bombers to the Spanish Republican Air Force; the response was negative. It also confirmed it would not take part in several mediation attempts, including one by the Organization <b>of</b> <b>American</b> <b>States.</b> Mexico soon became the first nation to openly support the Republicans. On 15 August, the United Kingdom banned exports of war material to Spain. Neurath also agreed to the pact, and suggested that volunteers (many of whom would eventually form the International Brigades) be included. Italy similarly agreed, signing on 21 August after a determined diplomatic offensive by Britain and France. Although a surprising reversal of views, it has been put down to the growing belief that countries could not abide by the agreement anyway. Admiral Raeder urged the German government either to back the Nationalists more completely, and bring Europe {{to the brink of}} war, or to abandon them. On the 24th, Germany signed.|$|E
