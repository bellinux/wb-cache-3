5|$|On November 6, 2008, Emanuel {{accepted}} the position <b>of</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Chief of Staff for US President Barack Obama. He resigned his congressional seat effective January 2, 2009. A special primary {{to fill his}} vacated congressional seat was held on March 3, 2009, and the special general election on April 7. John Fritchey, a candidate for that seat, said at a forum that Emanuel had told him he {{may be interested in}} running for the seat again in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{legal battle}} over the tapes {{continued}} through early 1974, and in April 1974 Nixon announced the release of 1,200 pages of transcripts <b>of</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> conversations {{between him and his}} aides. The House Judiciary Committee opened impeachment hearings against the President on May 9, 1974, which were televised on the major TV networks. These hearings culminated in votes for impeachment. On July 24, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the full tapes, not just selected transcripts, must be released.|$|E
5|$|On June 2, 1956, the Republican National Committee {{announced}} that Chotiner {{would have no}} role in the upcoming campaign. On June 6, a House subcommittee disclosed that the California attorney had written to President Eisenhower asking the President to intercede on behalf of Stanley Weiss's low-cost charter line North American Airlines (NAA) before the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). The attorney admitted inquiring <b>of</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> aides concerning the case, but denied using any influence on behalf of any client. White House officials said that they had done no more than ask the CAB when a decision might be expected in NAA's case, and that NAA had lost before the CAB anyway.|$|E

50|$|The Curator <b>of</b> the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> or less {{formally}} <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Curator, is head <b>of</b> the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Office <b>of</b> the Curator {{which is}} charged with the conservation and study of the collection of fine art, furniture and decorative objects used to furnish {{both the public and}} private rooms <b>of</b> the <b>White</b> <b>House.</b>|$|R
50|$|The office {{began in}} 1961 during the {{administration}} of President John F. Kennedy while First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy oversaw the restoration <b>of</b> the <b>White</b> <b>House.</b> The office {{is located in the}} ground floor <b>of</b> the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Executive Residence. The office, headed by the Curator <b>of</b> the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> includes an Associate Curator, an Assistant Curator, and a Curatorial Assistant.

5|$|The First Lady {{secured the}} {{assistance}} of renowned interior designer Ted Graber, popular with affluent West Coast social figures, to redecorate the family living quarters. A Chinese-pattern, handpainted wallpaper {{was added to the}} master bedroom. Family furniture was placed in the president's private study. The First Lady and her designer retrieved a number <b>of</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> antiques, which had been in storage, and placed them throughout the mansion. In addition, many of Reagan's own collectibles were put out for display, including around twenty-five Limoges Boxes, as well as some porcelain eggs and a collection of plates.|$|E
5|$|The subpoenas are {{handed out}} in the hearing over Bartlet's {{concealment}} of his multiple sclerosis. The special prosecutor, Clement Rollins (Pryor), appears to be both fair and responsible, but C.J. believes the White House will be better served {{in the public eye}} if investigated by a partisan agent. She therefore decides—against the strong objections <b>of</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> counsel Oliver Babish—to present Rollins as an ally of the administration, thereby forcing Congress to take control over the investigation. Meanwhile Donna, unwittingly, becomes entangled in potential problems over the hearings. Ainsley Hayes sets her up on a date with the Republican House Government Oversight Committee counsel Clifford Calley, but even though the date seems to go well, Calley then leaves her quite abruptly {{in the middle of the}} street. Donna later realizes the reason: his congressional committee is the one that will be in charge of the investigation, and a relationship between the two could constitute a conflict of interest.|$|E

25|$|Out {{of respect}} for the {{historic}} character <b>of</b> the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> no substantive architectural changes have been made to the house since the Truman renovation. Since the Kennedy restoration, every presidential family has made some changes to the private quarters <b>of</b> the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> but the Committee for the Preservation <b>of</b> the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> must approve any modifications to the State Rooms. Charged with maintaining the historical integrity <b>of</b> the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> the congressionally authorized committee works with each First Family—usually represented by the First Lady, the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Curator, and the Chief Usher—to implement the family's proposals for altering the house.|$|R
50|$|The Committee for the Preservation <b>of</b> the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> {{was created}} by Executive Order in 1964 by President Lyndon Johnson to replace a {{temporary}} <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Furnishings Committee established by First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy during the Kennedy <b>White</b> <b>House</b> restoration (1961-1963). The committee is charged with establishing policies relating to the museum function <b>of</b> the <b>White</b> <b>House,</b> its state rooms and collections. It also works with the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Historical Association in making recommendations on acquisitions for the permanent collection <b>of</b> the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> and provides advice on changes to principal rooms on the ground floor, state floor, and the historic guest suites on the residence floor <b>of</b> the <b>White</b> <b>House</b> Executive Residence.|$|R

25|$|The project {{not only}} accused Clinton of {{financial}} and sexual indiscretions (some later verified, others not), but also gave root to conspiracist notions that the Clintons {{collaborated with the}} CIA to run a drug smuggling operation out {{of the town of}} Mena, Arkansas and that Clinton had arranged for the murder <b>of</b> <b>White</b> <b>House</b> aide Vince Foster as part of a coverup of the Whitewater scandal. The possibility that money from the project had been given to former Clinton associate David Hale, a witness in the Whitewater investigation, led to the appointment of Michael J. Shaheen as a special investigator. Shaheen subpoenaed Scaife, who testified before a federal grand jury in the matter.|$|E
25|$|Nixon {{resigned}} from office on August 9, 1974. Early that morning White House Chief of Staff Alexander Haig brought Nixon a prepared letter of resignation, which {{was addressed to}} Secretary of State Henry Kissinger {{as required by the}} Presidential Succession Act.
