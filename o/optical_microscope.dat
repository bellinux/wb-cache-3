Laue`s said that 'has extended the power of on serving minute structure ten thousand times beyond that of the <b>optical</b> <b>microscope.</b> X-ray diffraction produced a microscope with atomic resolution which shows the atoms and their electron distribution.|$|E
5|$|Most natural {{diamonds}} contain extended {{planar defects}} in the <100> lattice planes, which are called platelets. Their size ranges from nanometers to many micrometers, and large ones are easily observed in an <b>optical</b> <b>microscope</b> via their luminescence. For a long time, platelets were tentatively associated with large nitrogen complexes — nitrogen sinks produced {{as a result}} of nitrogen aggregation at high temperatures of the diamond synthesis. However, direct measurement of nitrogen in the platelets by EELS (an analytical technique of electron microscopy) revealed very little nitrogen. The currently accepted model of platelets is a large regular array of carbon interstitials.|$|E
5|$|Viewed in deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} of Marasmius rotula appear white or pale yellow. Under an <b>optical</b> <b>microscope,</b> they are hyaline (translucent), teardrop- or pip-shaped, and have {{dimensions}} of 7–10 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-producing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped or nearly so, and 21–21 by 4–17µm. Along {{the edge of the}} gill, interspersed among the basidia, are non-reproductive cells, the cheilocystidia; these are club-shaped with rough wart-like protuberances on the surface. The gill edges further feature broom cells, which are variably shaped, thin-walled, and measure 7–32 by 2.5–20µm. Their apical surfaces are covered with yellowish, blunt, and conical warts or incrustations 0.2–1.5 by 0.1–1µm.|$|E
50|$|With current <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes,</b> {{scientists}} {{can only make}} out relatively large structures within a cell, such as its nucleus and mitochondria. With a superlens, <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> could one day reveal the movements of individual proteins traveling along the microtubules {{that make up a}} cell's skeleton, the researchers said. <b>Optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> can capture an entire frame with a single snapshot in a fraction of a second. With superlenses this opens up nanoscale imaging to living materials, which can help biologists better understand cell structure and function in real time.|$|R

5|$|The poxviruses are large, complex {{viruses that}} have an unusual morphology. The viral genome is {{associated}} with proteins within a central disc structure known as a nucleoid. The nucleoid {{is surrounded by a}} membrane and two lateral bodies of unknown function. The virus has an outer envelope with a thick layer of protein studded over its surface. The whole virion is slightly pleiomorphic, ranging from ovoid to brick shape. Mimivirus {{is one of the largest}} characterised viruses, with a capsid diameter of 400nm. Protein filaments measuring 100nm project from the surface. The capsid appears hexagonal under an electron microscope, therefore the capsid is probably icosahedral. In 2011, researchers discovered the largest then known virus in samples of water collected from the ocean floor off the coast of Las Cruces, Chile. Provisionally named Megavirus chilensis, it can be seen with a basic <b>optical</b> <b>microscope.</b> In 2013, the Pandoravirus genus was discovered in Chile and Australia, and has genomes about twice as large as Megavirus and Mimivirus.|$|E
5|$|While not {{inside an}} {{infected}} cell {{or in the}} process of infecting a cell, viruses exist in the form of independent particles. These viral particles, also known as virions, consist of two or three parts: (i) the genetic material made from either DNA or RNA, long molecules that carry genetic information; (ii) a protein coat, called the capsid, which surrounds and protects the genetic material; and in some cases (iii) an envelope of lipids that surrounds the protein coat when they are outside a cell. The shapes of these virus particles range from simple helical and icosahedral forms for some virus species to more complex structures for others. Most virus species have virions that are too small to be seen with an <b>optical</b> <b>microscope.</b> The average virion is about one one-hundredth the size of the average bacterium.|$|E

50|$|Wide field <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> and {{transmission}} electron microscopes both use the theory of lenses (optics for light microscopes and electromagnet lenses for electron microscopes) in order to magnify the image generated by {{the passage of a}} wave transmitted through the sample, or reflected by the sample. The waves used are electromagnetic (in <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes)</b> or electron beams (in electron microscopes). Resolution in these microscopes is limited by the wavelength of the radiation used to image the sample, where shorter wavelengths allow for a higher resolution.|$|R
25|$|In light microscopy, {{the word}} {{aperture}} {{may be used}} with reference to either the condenser (changes angle of light onto specimen field), field iris (changes area of illumination) or possibly objective lens (forms primary image). See <b>Optical</b> <b>microscope.</b>|$|E

25|$|Spectacle makers created {{improved}} {{types of}} lenses for the correction of vision {{based more on}} empirical knowledge gained from observing {{the effects of the}} lenses (probably without the knowledge of the rudimentary optical theory of the day).

25|$|Because of {{the surface}} tension, the shape is {{smoothed}} during the drawing process, and {{the shape of the}} resulting fiber does not reproduce the sharp edges of the preform. Nevertheless, careful polishing of the preform is important, since any defects of the preform surface affect the optical and mechanical properties of the resulting fiber. In particular, the preform for the test-fiber shown in the figure was not polished well, and cracks are seen with the confocal <b>optical</b> <b>microscope.</b>|$|E

25|$|Medical {{applications}} include imaging of the retina, {{where it}} has been combined with optical coherence tomography. Also the development of Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Opthalmoscope (AOSLO) has enabled correcting for the aberrations of the wavefront that is reflected from the human retina and to take diffraction limited images of the human rods and cones. Development of an Adaptive Scanning <b>Optical</b> <b>Microscope</b> (ASOM) was announced by Thorlabs in April 2007. Adaptive and active optics are also being developed for use in glasses to achieve better than 20/20 vision, initially for military applications.|$|E

25|$|The {{refractive}} index (1.7) and optical dispersion properties of germanium dioxide makes it useful as an optical material for wide-angle lenses, in <b>optical</b> <b>microscope</b> objective lenses, {{and for the}} core of fiber-optic lines. See Optical fiber for specifics on the manufacturing process. Both Germanium and its glass oxide, GeO2 are transparent to the infrared spectrum. The glass can be manufactured into IR windows and lenses, used for night-vision technology in the military, luxury vehicles, and Thermographic cameras. GeO2 is preferred over other IR transparent glasses because it is mechanically strong and therefore preferred for rugged military usage.|$|E
25|$|Following the Bridgman anvil, {{the diamond}} anvil cell {{became the most}} {{versatile}} pressure generating device that has a single characteristic that sets it apart from the other pressure devices. This provided the early high pressure pioneers with the capability to directly observe the properties of a material while under pressure. With just {{the use of an}} <b>optical</b> <b>microscope,</b> phase boundaries, color changes and recrystallization could be seen immediately, while x-ray diffraction or spectroscopy required time to expose and develop photographic film. The potential for the diamond anvil cell was realized by Alvin Van Valkenburg while he was preparing a sample for IR spectroscopy and was checking the alignment of the diamond faces.|$|E
25|$|Chromatic {{aberration}} {{is caused}} by the dispersion of the lens material—the variation of its refractive index, n, with the wavelength of light. Since, from the formulae above, f is dependent upon n, it follows that light of different wavelengths is focused to different positions. Chromatic aberration of a lens is seen as fringes of colour around the image. It can be minimised by using an achromatic doublet (or achromat) in which two materials with differing dispersion are bonded together to form a single lens. This reduces the amount of chromatic aberration over a certain range of wavelengths, though it does not produce perfect correction. The use of achromats was an important step {{in the development of the}} <b>optical</b> <b>microscope.</b> An apochromat is a lens or lens system with even better chromatic aberration correction, combined with improved spherical aberration correction. Apochromats are much more expensive than achromats.|$|E
5000|$|All modern <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> {{designed}} for viewing samples {{by transmitted light}} share the same basic components of the light path. In addition, {{the vast majority of}} microscopes have the same 'structural' components (numbered below according to the image on the right): ...|$|R
25|$|Thus, {{the larger}} the {{aperture}} of the lens, and the smaller the wavelength, the finer the resolution of an imaging system. This is why telescopes have very large lenses or mirrors, and why <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> are limited in the detail which they can see.|$|R
25|$|Diamond is {{notorious for}} having a {{relatively}} large lattice strain. Strain splits and shifts optical transitions from individual centers resulting in broad lines in the ensembles of centers. Special care is taken to produce extremely sharp N-V lines (line width ~10nbsp&MHz) required for most experiments: high-quality, pure natural or better synthetic diamonds (type IIa) are selected. Many of them already have sufficient concentrations of grown-in N-V centers and are suitable for applications. If not, they are irradiated by high-energy particles and annealed. Selection of a certain irradiation dose allows tuning the concentration of produced N-V centers such that individual N-V centers are separated by micrometre-large distances. Then, individual N-V centers can be studied with standard <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> or, better, near-field scanning <b>optical</b> <b>microscopes</b> having sub-micrometre resolution.|$|R
