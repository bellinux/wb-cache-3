25|$|Another {{significant}} Egyptian mathematical text is the Moscow papyrus, {{also from}} the Middle Kingdom period, dated to c. 1890 BC. It consists of what are today called word problems or story problems, which were apparently intended as entertainment. <b>One</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> considered to be of particular importance because it gives a method for finding the volume of a frustum (truncated pyramid).|$|E
25|$|Although localizationist {{approaches}} {{provide a}} useful way of classifying the different patterns of language difficulty into broad groups, <b>one</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that a sizeable {{number of individuals}} do not fit neatly into one category or another. Another {{problem is that the}} categories, particularly the major ones such as Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia, still remain quite broad. Consequently, even amongst individuals who meet the criteria for classification into a subtype, there can be enormous variability in the types of difficulties they experience.|$|E

25|$|<b>One</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> how to {{integrate}} the doctrine of anatta {{with the idea of}} karma and rebirth. The anatta-doctrine stipulates that there is no underlying self, while the idea of karma and rebirth seems to implicate an underlying essence that's being reborn. A solution to this problem was the proposition of the existence of karmic seeds. The karmic effects of the human deeds lie dormant, as seeds, until they germinate in this or a next life. Not an individual self, but these karmic seeds are the base for the generation of a following life.|$|E
25|$|Scipionyx {{was by the}} describers {{assigned}} to the Coelurosauria, a group of theropods. Because the only remains recovered belong {{to that of a}} juvenile, it has proven difficult to assign this dinosaur to a more specific group. <b>One</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that in the build of a juvenile animal the original traits of ancestor groups {{are more likely to be}} expressed, suggesting a too basal position in the evolutionary tree. Part of the 2011 monograph was a cladistic analysis which indicated that Scipionyx was a basal member of the Compsognathidae and the sister species of Orkoraptor. Dal Sasso & Maganuco emphasised that, due to its limited remains, the position of Orkoraptor is tentative.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} features of teaching in the promotion of conceptual understanding are attending explicitly to concepts and allowing students to struggle with important mathematics. Both of these features have been confirmed through a wide variety of studies. Explicit attention to concepts involves making connections between facts, procedures and ideas. (This is often seen as one of the strong points in mathematics teaching in East Asian countries, where teachers typically devote about half of their time to making connections. At the other extreme is the U.S.A., where essentially no connections are made in school classrooms.) These connections can be made through explanation of the meaning of a procedure, questions comparing strategies and solutions of problems, noticing how <b>one</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> a special case of another, reminding students of the main point, discussing how lessons connect, and so on.|$|E

In this paper we study this problem with the additional requirement that also in every column the 1 -entries have to be consecutive. To achieve this column permutations have to be allowed as well. We show that the weighted simultaneous consecutive <b>ones</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> NP-hard and consider two special cases with fixed row and column permutations where one is still NP-hard and the other one turns out to be easy...|$|R
500|$|When {{constructing}} continuous-time stochastic processes certain mathematical difficulties arise, {{due to the}} uncountable index sets, {{which do}} not occur with discrete-time processes. [...] <b>One</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that {{is it possible to}} have [...] more than one stochastic process with the same finite-dimensional distributions. For example, both the left-continuous modification and the right-continuous modification of a Poisson process have the same finite-dimensional distributions. This means that the distribution of the stochastic process does not uniquely specify the properties of the sample functions of the stochastic process.|$|E

2500|$|The Chinese side of Everest in Tibet was {{described}} as [...] "out of control" [...] after one Canadian had all his gear stolen and was abandoned by his Sherpa. Another sherpa helped him get off the mountain safely and gave him some spare gear. Other climbers have also reported missing oxygen bottles, which can be worth hundreds of dollars each. <b>One</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that hundreds of climbers pass by people's tents. Also weather can damage or even blow people's equipment away.|$|E
2500|$|Size {{selectivity}} {{is controlled}} by the mesh size of the [...] "cod-end"—the part of the trawl where fish are retained. Fishermen complain that mesh sizes which allow undersized fish to escape also allows some legally–catchable fish to escape as well. There are a number of [...] "fixes", such as tying a rope around the [...] "cod-end" [...] to prevent the mesh from opening fully, which have been developed to work around technical regulation of size selectivity. <b>One</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> when the mesh gets pulled into narrow diamond shapes (rhombuses) instead of squares.|$|E

25|$|The {{propulsion}} system {{consists of a}} fuel tank and a separate tank for the Red fuming nitric acid oxidiser. <b>One</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> that the missile required fuelling just before flight, and not many airfields had the appropriate facilities.

2500|$|<b>One</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> {{in regard}} to the {{semantic}} difficulty of deciding the precise meaning of [...] "human". A population of, say, 4 million, with an average lifespan of, say, 10 years (see below), implies a birthrate of 0.4 million per year, which over a period of 100000 years represents 40000 million people. Also, robust population data only exists for {{the last two or three}} centuries. Until the late 18th century, few governments had ever performed an accurate census. In many early attempts, such as in Ancient Egypt and the Persian Empire, the focus was on counting merely a subset of the population for purposes of taxation or military service. Thus, there is a significant margin of error when estimating ancient global populations.|$|E
2500|$|Archaeologists have {{searched for}} the sites of the sunken Guerrero and {{grounding}} of Nimble. One area of interest is the entrance to Turtle Harbor, four {{miles east of the}} northern end of Key Largo and three and a half miles north of the Carysfort Reef Light. Artifacts found to date in the area do not specifically identify any ship. Swanson maintains that the wreck sites are likely further north, near Pacific Reef. <b>One</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that various accounts place the wreck sites at six to ten miles from the Carysfort Reef lightship, but the position of that lightship is not well established (contemporary sources vary wildly, even putting the lightship inland). A documentary about the search for the Guerrero wreck site narrated by James Avery, The Guerrero Project, was produced in 2004.|$|E
2500|$|Darby {{also notes}} the inconsistencies, saying that [...] "when this great wealth of data is {{examined}} more closely, perplexities and difficulties arise." [...] <b>One</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that the clerks who compiled this document [...] "were but human; they were frequently forgetful or confused." [...] The use of Roman numerals {{also led to}} countless mistakes. Darby states, [...] "Anyone who attempts an arithmetical exercise in Roman numerals soon sees something of the difficulties that faced the clerks." [...] But more important are the numerous obvious omissions, and ambiguities in presentation. Darby first cites F. W. Maitland's comment following his compilation of a table of statistics from material taken from the Domesday Book survey, [...] "it will be remembered that, as matters now stand, two men not unskilled in Domesday might add up the number of hides in a county and arrive at very different results because they would hold different opinions as to the meanings of certain formulas which are not uncommon." [...] Darby says that [...] "it would be more correct to speak not of 'the Domesday geography of England', but of 'the geography of Domesday Book'. The two may not be quite the same thing, and how near the record was to reality we can never know." ...|$|E
5000|$|The DG-1 {{was only}} a modest success. <b>One</b> <b>problem</b> <b>was</b> its use of 3½" [...] diskettes.

2500|$|Karl Denninger, former CEO {{and one of}} the {{original}} co-founders of the Tea Party movement, expressed support for the movement, saying [...] "The problem with protests and the political process is that it is very easy, no matter how big the protest is, for the politicians to simply wait until the people go home, and then they can ignore you. Well, Occupy Wall Street was a little different, and back in 2008, I wrote that when we will actually see change is when the people come, they set up camp, and they refuse to go home. That appears to be happening now." [...] Jeff Immelt, CEO of General Electric and a member of Obama's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, stated [...] "It is natural to assume that people are angry, and I {{think we have to be}} empathetic and understand that people are not feeling great." [...] Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, stated in an interview with Charlie Rose, [...] "I think the number <b>one</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that we're not having a quality dialogue...I certainly understand the frustration, I understand the dilemma, I understand the discontent."

2500|$|The renowned {{astronomer}} Carl Sagan {{proposed the}} planetary engineering of Venus {{in an article}} published in the journal Science in 1961. Sagan imagined seeding the atmosphere of Venus with algae, which would convert water, nitrogen and carbon dioxide into organic compounds. As this process removed carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect would be reduced until surface temperatures dropped to [...] "comfortable" [...] levels. The resulting carbon, Sagan supposed, would be incinerated by the high surface temperatures of Venus, and thus be sequestered in the form of [...] "graphite or some involatile form of carbon" [...] on the planet's surface. However, later discoveries about the conditions on Venus made this particular approach impossible. <b>One</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> that the clouds of Venus are composed of a highly concentrated sulfuric acid solution. Even if atmospheric algae could thrive in the hostile environment of Venus's upper atmosphere, an even more insurmountable problem is that its atmosphere is simply far too thick—the high atmospheric pressure would result in an [...] "atmosphere of nearly pure molecular oxygen" [...] and cause the planet's surface to be thickly covered in fine graphite powder. This volatile combination could not be sustained through time. Any carbon that was fixed in organic form would be liberated as carbon dioxide again through combustion, [...] "short-circuiting" [...] the terraforming process.|$|E
2500|$|Hybridomas are cells {{obtained}} by fusing tumor cells (which can divide infinitely) and immunoglobulin-producing lymphocytes (plasma cells). Hybridomas can {{be expanded to}} produce large quantities of immunoglobulins with a given unique specificity (monoclonal antibodies). <b>One</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> to single out the hybridomas from the large excess of unfused cells after the cell fusion. One common way to solve this is to use thymidine kinase negative (TK−) tumor cell lines for the fusion. The thymidine kinase negative cells are {{obtained by}} growing the tumor cell line {{in the presence of}} thymidine analogs, that kill the thymidine kinase positive (TK+) cells. The negative cells can then be expanded and used for the fusion with TK+ plasma cells. After fusion, the cells are grown in a medium with methotrexate or aminopterin that inhibit the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase thus blocking the de novo synthesis of thymidine monophosphate. One such medium that is commonly used is HAT medium, which contains hypoxanthine, aminopterinand thymidine. The unfused cells from the thymidine kinase-deficient cell line die because they have no source of thymidine monophosphate. The lymphocytes eventually die because they are not [...] "immortal." [...] Only the hybridomas that have [...] "immortality" [...] from their cell line ancestor and thymidine kinase from the plasma cell survive. Those that produce the desired antibody are then selected and cultured to produce the monoclonal antibody. Hybridoma cells can also be isolated using the same principle as described with respect to another gene the HGPRT, which synthesizes IMP necessary for GMP nucleotide synthesis in the salvage pathway.|$|E
