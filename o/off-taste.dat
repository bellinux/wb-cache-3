25|$|Acetaldehyde is a colorless, {{volatile}} substance with a fruity smell. Although it forms naturally in some fruit, {{it can cause}} an <b>off-taste</b> in bottled water. Acetaldehyde forms by degradation of PET through the mishandling of the material.

When acetaldehyde is produced, some of it remains dissolved in the walls of a container and then diffuses into the product stored inside, altering the taste and aroma. This is not such a problem for non-consumables (such as shampoo), for fruit juices (which already contain acetaldehyde), or for strong-tasting drinks like soft drinks. For bottled water, however, low acetaldehyde content is quite important, because, if nothing masks the aroma, even extremely low concentrations (10–20 parts per billion in the water) of acetaldehyde can produce an <b>off-taste.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{need for}} sodium {{reduction}} in our diet {{is clear to}} consumers, dieticians and food manufacturers. As sodium concentration has a strengthening effect on gluten, sodium reduction decreases dough mixing tolerance, dough resistance and induces dough stickiness.

Finally, NaCl or more specifically, sodium, is characterized by a highly desired salty taste. Sodium can also enhance the overall taste intensity of a product, and is able to mask <b>off-tastes</b> like bitterness at the same time. Because of that, sodium not only determines the saltiness of a product, but has a large impact on the overall flavor of a product.

40|$|Abstract: The {{mechanistic}} {{understanding of}} sweet taste chemoreception has been advanced by the microscopic and macroscopic studies of sweetener–water interactions. This approach {{has led to}} the concept of water mobility as a key to interpreting sweetness. The apparent spe-cific volume of a solution is a determinant of its taste quality, as sweetness is known to be confined to the range 0. 51 – 0. 71 cm 3 g– 1. Thus, the “ideal ” quality of the sugars is presumed to be due to their occupancy of the center of this range (i. e., 0. 618 cm 3 g– 1). Most sweeten-ers elicit <b>off-tastes</b> and flavors and exhibit different apparent specific volumes. This leads to the conclusion that taste quality is broadly determined by the packing characteristics of sweet molecules among water molecules and the compactness of their hydration shells, expressed as their apparent specific isentropic compressibilities. The role of water can, therefore, be applied in modern attempts to optimize sweet taste quality, and different food salts can be explored as useful taste modifiers. Salts interact more strongly with water structure than do any other taste solutes, and it emerges that the ionic charge density is an important criterion. Such studies show how sweetener formulations are likely to improve within the next decade...|$|R
40|$|Use {{of natural}} noncaloric {{sweeteners}} in commercial foods and beverages has expanded recently to include compounds {{from the plant}} Stevia rebaudiana. Little {{is known about the}} responses of rodents, the animal models for many studies of taste systems and food intake, to stevia sweeteners. In the present experiments, preferences of female Sprague–Dawley rats and C 57 BL/ 6 J mice for different stevia products were compared with those for the artificial sweetener saccharin. The stevia component rebaudioside A has the most sweetness and least <b>off-tastes</b> to human raters. In ascending concentration tests (48 -h sweetener vs. water), rats and mice preferred a high-rebaudioside, low-stevioside extract as strongly as saccharin, but the extract stimulated less overdrinking and was much less preferred to saccharin in direct choice tests. Relative to the extract, mice drank more pure rebaudioside A and showed stronger preferences but still less than those for saccharin. Mice also preferred a commercial mixture of rebaudioside A and erythritol (Truvia). Similar tests of sweet receptor T 1 R 3 knockout mice and brief-access licking tests with normal mice suggested that the preferences were based on sweet taste rather than post-oral effects. The preference response of rodents to stevia sweeteners is notable in view of their minimal response to some other noncaloric sweeteners (aspartame and cyclamate) ...|$|R
40|$|Enrichment of {{flavonoids}} in food {{is often}} limited by their <b>off-tastes,</b> {{which might be}} counteracted {{by the use of}} food proteins as carriers of flavonoids. Various milk proteins, egg proteins, and gelatin hydrolysates were compared for their binding characteristics to two flavan- 3 -ols. Among the proteins tested for their affinities toward epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), ß-casein and gelatin hydrolysates, in particular fish gelatin, were found to be the most promising carriers with an affinity on the order of 104 M- 1. A flexible open structure of proteins, as present in random coil proteins, was found to be important. The saturation of binding observed at high flavonoid/protein ratios was used to estimate the maximal binding capacity of each protein. To reach a daily intake of EGCG that has been associated with positive health effects, only 519 mg of gelatin B and 787 mg of ß-casein were required to complex EGCG {{on the basis of their}} maximal binding capacity. When the absence of turbidity is taken into account, ß-casein prevails as carrier. Three selected proteins were further investigated for their binding potential of representative flavonoids differing in their C-ring structure. An increase in hydrophobicity of flavonoids was related to a higher affinity for proteins, and the presence of a gallic acid ester on the C-ring showed an overall higher affinity...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{incorporation}} of different contents of chokeberry polyphenols extract (CPE) into cookie recipe on the oxidative {{stability of the}} lipid fraction of cookies was determined in the study. Margarine and butter cookies with different contents of CPE were prepared. Contents of primary (Peroxide value, PV) and secondary (Anisidine value, AV; thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, TBARS) lipid oxidation products and fatty acids profile were measured during storage. Different course of lipid degradation depending on both polyphenols content and storage time was shown. Cookies were characterised by a low PV (1. 45 and 4. 90 meq of O/kg of fat in margarine and butter cookies, respectively). The AV increased during storage both in margarine and in butter cookies. Losses of PUFA in margarine cookies (0. 34 %) apply mainly to α-linolenic acid.

40|$|The {{development}} of phenolic-rich functional foods is often {{limited by the}} <b>off-tastes</b> of phenolics that might be counteracted by sequestering these compounds using a carrier, thereby preventing them to interact with bitter taste receptors and salivary proteins. A range of common animal food proteins were tested for binding of phenolics. It appeared that a proline-rich open protein structure, as in β-casein, favored binding of phenolics. Globular proteins other than bovine serum albumin showed poor potential for use as carrier. No appropriate carriers for monomeric phenolics were found. β-Casein and Na-caseinate were shown to have good bitter-masking potential for EGCG, as measured by a maximal reduction in bitter receptor activation of ~ 93 % measured in vitro. This effective reduction in bitter receptor activation was confirmed by a sensory test. This illustrates the validity of using food proteins with good binding properties as carriers for phenolics. Different methodologies for probing the interaction between proteins and phenolics were developed: (i) ultrafiltration followed by UV quantification of unbound phenolics in the retentate, (ii) fluorescence quenching, and (iii) ultrafiltration followed by mass spectrometric quantification of unbound phenolics in the retentate. The latter method offered the opportunity to analyze preferential binding to protein of individual phenolics present in a complex mixture. With these methods, it was established that, with respect to phenolics, conformation and flexibility were important drivers of protein-phenolic interaction, besides degree of polymerization and galloylation. With respect to relatively proline-poor unstructured proteins such as α-casein and β-casein, it appeared {{that there should be}} other factors, besides proline density, explaining the interaction with phenolics...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades, PET {{has grown to}} be one of the most widely used {{engineering}} polymers. Glass and metal containers have been slowly overrun by the cheaper, lighter and more resilient PET-bottles. Additionally, the much lower energy input that goes into the production of these bottles has proven them to be a much more environment-friendly alternative to the traditional containers. As a disadvantage, some properties of PET, such as the permeability of gases, might render it unqualified for certain products. However, there is a wide range of technologies to improve these properties by altering the composition or the production process. One of these technologies is the active oxygen barrier. Sauces, juices, beer and wine are all examples of oxygen sensitive products that are packaged in PET. The ingress of oxygen would not only deteriorate the nutritional value, but will create <b>off-tastes</b> and discoloration. For all these applications, it is imperative that the expiration date would be prolonged as much as possible by disabling the ingress of oxygen, a feat that is unattainable so far by any passive barrier. While a passive barrier just lowers the diffusion of the gas through the bottle wall, an active barrier will incite chemical interactions to scavenge oxygen that attempts to enter the bottle’s interior. The most widely used active oxygen barrier consists of a cobalt salt and a sacrificial polymer. Cobalt herein acts as an oxidation catalyst, providing oxygen activation at room temperature and making it sufficiently reactive to oxidize the sacrificial. However, recently the toxicity of cobalt has been put under review. The new studies have showed that the health of the plant workers may be in danger by the cobalt handling and prospects are that the metal would be banished in packaging soon. This project investigates the catalytic behavior of the metal salt and starting from the mechanism, crucial properties such as safety, recyclability and visual appeal, will be improved.

Enrichment of poultry products with n- 3 PUFA may provide an excellent alternative source of these acids in the human diet. In our experiment with feeding different levels of linseed oil made either of the flax cultivar with a high content of α-linolenic acid (LNA) or of the cultivar with a predominating content of linoleic acid (LA), the content of n- 3 PUFA in breast meat (BM) and thigh meat (TM) ranged from 28 to 278 and from 69 to 724 mg/ 100 g of meat, respectively, while that of n- 6 PUFA fluctuated from 141 to 498 and from 584 to 1 586 mg/ 100 g of BM and TM, respectively (Zelenka et al., 2008). This indicates that {{by means of an}} inclusion of linseed oil with a high content of LNA in the diet it could be pos-sible to produce poultry meat as a functional food containing high amounts of n- 3 PUFA. Unsaturated lipids readily undergo oxidation to produce peroxides and aldehydes. The oxidative stability of unsaturated lipids decreases as their de-gree of unsaturation increases. Poultry meat with an enhanced LNA content is more susceptible to oxidative damage than meat with a similar concen-tration of LA.

This study was geared toward comparing physicochemical, biochemical and organoleptic evaluations of two commercial pineapple cultivars 'MD 2 ' and 'Morris'. Six fruits of each cultivars were purchased at commercial maturity stage which is about 20 - 40 % yellowing of fruit peel and flesh of fruits were used for evaluations. Results of physicochemical analysis showed that 'MD 2 ' is the sweeter and less astringent variety compared to 'Morris' and the same was also observed biochemically where antioxidant capacity, protein content and bromelain enzymatic activity were higher in 'MD 2 '.

A Quality Index Method (QIM) scheme developed for maatjes herring was used for sensory evaluation. The main reasons for sensory rejections at both storage temperatures were a strong rancid taste for herring stored in air (Experiment I) and a sour, bitter, rotten taste and an aftertaste like old flower water for MAP herring (Experiments II and III). A soft texture of freshly produced samples (Experiment II) was noticed. The sensory shelf-life of maatjes herring stored in air (Experiment I) was three days at both 4 and 10 °C. The MAP herring in Experiments II and III had a shelf-life of 5 and 6 days, respectively, at both storage temperatures. Rancidity due to oxidation of fat was the main spoilage indicator for air-stored maatjes herring. Autolytic enzymes may affect textural deterioration. The characteristic off-odour and <b>off-taste</b> in the MAP herring (Experiments II and III) were may well be attributable to microbial metabolism.

In recent years, packaging industry prefers to use hot melt adhesive based on polyolefin because polyolefin provide ease of processing, low <b>off-taste,</b> low smell and heat seal ability. In this research, it is intended to develop the formulation for Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) based hot melt adhesive with the same properties of polyolefin based hot melt adhesive since EVA offers low cost than polyolefin. To develop new formulation of EVA hot melt adhesive (HMA), EVA copolymers with various melt index were blended together with resin, wax and antioxidant in the molten state. The performance of new formulations was compared with commercial polyolefin hot melt adhesive. Three formulations of EVA hot melt adhesive have been developed. The thermal properties such as glass transition temperature and melt viscosity were studied by using differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) and Brookfield Viscometer. From DSC curve, the result indicated that three new formulations and commercial polyolefin has a glass transition temperature between - 20 0 C and - 25 0 C. Implying, the EVA copolymer blend with resin is compatible. The peak observed on the heating curve corresponded to the melting point, Tm. EVA-HMA 1 and EVA-HMA 3 is comparable with commercial polyoelfin based on identical broad peak. The melt viscosity of all EVA HMA formulation and commercial polyolefin HMA decrease with increasing the temperature. Hot melt adhesive with lower viscosity will have more flexibility to flow out, indicating that it has better wetting properties when applied to the substrate. EVA-HMA 3 have the best performance to be made the hot melt adhesive for the packaging industry because of comparable thermal properties and viscosity at desired temperature with commercial polyolefin adhesive. Further research needs to be conducted on EVA-HMA 3 for other properties to confirm its viability in replacing the commercial polyolefin based hot melt adhesive in packaging industry...|$|E

40|$|Whey is a {{byproduct}} of cheese, curd and casein manufacture and as {{an excellent source of}} proteins, vitamins, minerals and lactose can be used in wide range of industrial production. If treated as waste material without further processing, it can have negative impact on the environment. Main components of whey are water (93 % of total volume), lactose (70 to 72 % of dry matter), whey protein (8 to 10 % solids), and minerals (12 to 15 % solids). Of the minerals, most abundant are magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, sodium, zinc, and their salts which are passed to whey from milk. Predominantly represented vitamins are water-soluble vitamins (B 1, B 2, B 12, B 6, and C) from which the vitamins B 2, B 12 and C are bound to the whey proteins. The most abundant whey proteins are betalactoglobulin, alfa lactalbumin, GMP (glycomacropeptide), bovine serum albumin, immunoglobulins, lactoferrin and lactoperoxidase. For each of these proteins have been demonstrated or at least implied, unique functional, nutritional or nutraceutical properties. The aim of the thesis was to compile a literature review focused on the possibility of using whey from the production of cheese and curd as raw materials for the manufacture of various types of beverages and monitoring the effect of the addition of various flavor components and whey proteins on the sensory quality of the drink prepared from fresh sour whey. The hypothesis of this work was that flavored whey drinks made from acid whey supplemented with whey protein have a higher sensory quality score than flavored drinks without the addition of whey protein and that whey drinks flavored with mango flavour are more acceptable by consumers they are able to mask undesirable off-tastes of sour whey better than flavor peaches, cherries and black currants. In all specimens, the effect of 8 different recipes and flavors of peaches, cherries, mango and blackcurrant on the final sensory quality and acceptability to consumers was observed. It was found that the best rated drinks were of cherry and mango flavors. Beverages with the addition of mango juice were able to reliably mask natural <b>off-taste</b> of whey, which supports the hypothesis about the appropriateness of using this flavor. Drinks with peach flavor were evaluated to be of the worst senzory quality. As of the best sensory quality were evaluated drinks flavored with cherry flavor, which reached the best overall evaluation. In all variants of formulas was observed that drinks with added WPC achieved better overall evaluation than similar variations without addition of WPC. Statistically significant results of this finding, however, were observed only in the context of mango flavors...|$|E
40|$|The {{significance}} of taste for human health:Throughout most of human evolution, the daily decisions {{of what to}} put into ones mouth and swallow and what to reject presented challenges fraught with danger. Energy-rich foods were often difficult to find; protein was in short supply; sodium was scarce. Moreover, many plants that did contain nutrients were also equipped with defensive compounds that were poisonous. Now many humans over consume exactly the foods that they evolved to find particularly attractive when they were scarce such as foods high in sweet sugars, fats, and added salt. Consequences of this overconsumption may include obesity, diabetes, hypertension which is {{a risk factor for}} cardiovascular disease, and other diseases of “excess. ” Helping to drive overconsumption of some nutrients and under consumption of others is the evolved taste for sweetness and saltiness and the distaste for bitter compounds that are often found in foods such as green vegetables. Thus, understanding of the biology and psychology of the taste system is central to enhancing human health. Basic tastes: Evolutionary significance and basic receptor mechanisms. Most investigators recognize 5 independent basic taste qualities: Sweet, bitter, sour, umami and salty and recent evidence indicates that each quality is recognized by specialized taste cells in taste buds in the oral cavity and elsewhere. There is also evidence that compounds that do not elicit such distinct qualities (e. g. fat and fatty acids, calcium, complex carbohydrates) may also impact the taste system in ways that are not fully understood [taste receptors reviewed in 1]. Sweet taste is elicited by simple sugars (e. g. sucrose, glucose, fructose, lactose) and many other compounds of diverse chemical structure, many of which are not found in nature (e. g. saccharin, sucralose, aspartame and the protein monellin). All of these compounds interact with a dimerized pair of proteins forming G-protein coupled taste receptors (GPCRs). This receptor system is able to recognize so many diverse compounds because they can interact with various portions of the heterodimer in addition to the traditional binding pocket. More recently, at least one other mechanism for detection of some sweeteners by sweet taste cells has been identified [2]. Humans and most other species that consume plants innately like sugars and some other sweeteners. Presumably, a liking for natural sweeteners evolved to insure intake of energy-rich plant material. Consistent with this idea are recent findings [3] that several obligate carnivores such as cats have lost sweet taste receptor function through fixation of disabling mutations. Bitter taste is elicited by a huge array of chemicals of greatly different structures. Presumably as a consequence, there are multiple structurally-related GPCR receptors (numbering approximately 25 in humans) that are differentially tuned to different classes of compounds that are innately avoided. It is believed that bitter taste evolved as a protective mechanism to avoid these toxic compounds although in some cases they may be selected by a sick animal because they have medicinal properties. Sour taste is elicited by acids. It is believed that one or more ion channel (as distinct from a GPCR) is responsible for sour taste but the identity of these channels is still unknown. The precise adaptive function for detecting sourness is also not clear although it is thought to involve protection against ingesting potential foods with very low pH as well as a way to judge ripeness of fruits. Umami taste is the most recently identified of the 5 basic tastes. The English word that most accurately expresses the umami quality is “savory” or chicken broth-like although the Japanese word roughly translates into delicious taste. In humans it is elicited by the amino acid glutamate (most commonly experienced as the sodium salt: MSG) and is enhanced synergistically by some 5 ’ ribonucleotides. One umami receptor is closely related to the sweet receptor although there may be other receptors involved. It is widely believed that this pleasant quality (at least when combined with other tastes and flavors in foods) is a signal for amino acids and hence protein. Finally, salty taste is stimulated almost exclusively by sodium-containing compounds, most potently by NaCl (salt). Recent studies have identified an epithelial sodium channel (“ENaC”) as at least one mechanism underlying salty taste. However {{there is at least one}} other mechanism underlying detection of salt that remains to be identified. Salt taste liking may have an innate component but recent work also suggests that experiences with salt in human infants and children may modulate liking [4]. Salt taste is critically involved in obtaining sodium, a mineral necessary for life and one that is often in short supply in nature. However, now there is a clear excess in both availability and intake which impacts human health. Salt taste and human health. Consumption of high-salt diets, which is common in virtually all human societies, leads to increases in blood pressure and can cause premature death [5]. As a consequence most government and many non-government health organizations around the world recommend that salt intake in the general population be reduced. However this is difficult in large part because of the taste-based attractiveness of salt in foods. Humans prefer many foods with salt for a variety of reasons. First, they like the taste of salt itself, although this is usually only in the context of other food flavors. Additionally, the sodium ion acts as a powerful inhibitor of bitterness and thus addition of salt to bitter foods such as vegetables increases their palatability by reducing some of the unpleasant bitter notes. Finally salt, by mechanisms not yet understood, increases palatability of foods by enhancing perception of mouth feel. Thus removal of salt in foods is not easy and many low salt foods are unpalatable [5, Chapter 4]. There are two general approaches to reducing dietary sodium. First, there is considerable interest in developing salt substitutes and salt enhancers. Potassium chloride is widely used (usually in combination with NaCl) as a substitute but it is not ideal since many find it has an unpleasant <b>off-taste.</b> There is considerable academic and industry research to identify new substitutes but to date there are none for salty as there are for sweet taste. A second approach to lowering sodium intake on a population-wide level in the United States, where more than 80 % of the average person’s salt intake comes from food purchased and not from being added during cooking or at the table, is for food manufacturers and restaurants to gradually reduce the amount of salt in prepared foods. Experimental studies have demonstrated that if one reduces salt intake preferences for salt are similarly reduced. Based on this, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommended that the Food and Drug Administration require gradual reduction by food manufacturers and large restaurant chains (IOM). The FDA has not acted on this recommendation. Conclusion. As illustrated by the difficulties in reducing salt in spite of the health benefits (a similar set of arguments for reducing excess consumption of carbohydrate sugars could be made), the sense of taste is a powerful driver of food intake. A deeper understanding of this important but neglected sensory system is required if we are to adequately address critical health problems in modern society that are often driven by excess consumption of tasty nutrients...|$|E
40|$|Microencapsulation is the {{technique}} of enclosing valuable or delicate materials in small containers for targeted delivery. These containers may consist of a core and a thin shell surrounding it. The core, with a size ranging from a few to hundreds of micrometers, contains the active material, and serves as template for the microcapsule. The shell, with a thickness {{of no more than}} a few hundred nanometers, lends mechanical, physical, or chemical protection, and the means to release the active materials in response to a well defined trigger. Microencapsulation is used in a number of industries, e. g. pharmaceutics and food. In the case of medicines, microencapsulation is important for the delivery of drugs at the correct location, in the right dose, and at the right moment, which otherwise would have to be overdosed to reach the desired therapeutic effects. In the case of food, microencapsulation may mask ingredients that would cause <b>off-taste</b> and protect sensitive or volatile materials like flavors, aromas, and antioxidants. In addition, microencapsulation will enable new product concepts, such as products with new sensory experiences (fizzy products from encapsulated CO 2) and, more importantly, healthier foods including nutraceuticals or probiotics. The microencapsulation methods that are used nowadays in industry on a fairly large scale allow limited control over the uniformity of the microcapsule size and geometry, and the thickness of the shell, while the harsh operation conditions pose restrictions on the type of ingredients that can be used. This poses a challenge to improve production methods and materials. Besides, specifically for food, the materials should additionally be food grade and inexpensive. In this thesis, microcapsules (1 - 20 micron) are constructed via self-assembly; i. e. using driving forces already available in nature. From the routes using self-assembly proposed in literature for microencapsulation two called our special attention, both starting from an oil droplet as template which determines the size of the microcapsule. The first route is that of colloidosome preparation, in which colloidal particles adsorb irreversibly and organize at the oil-water interface, creating a sturdy shell with pores defined by the interstices between the particles. The second route is electrostatic layer-by-layer adsorption: polyelectrolytes of opposite charge are sequentially adsorbed on a charged template, creating a thin film of which the thickness can be controlled with precision in the order of few nanometers. We have combined the two methods by using larger building blocks to construct stronger shells with better defined characteristics, using less adsorption cycles and based on food grade materials. These microcapsules are designed to protect an eventual encapsulated material from low-pH conditions and deliver their contents in response to a change in pH, having in mind applications that would require delivery through the stomach into the small intestine. In Chapter 2, the available techniques to produce colloidosomes are reviewed. Microcapsules can be assembled from both, oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions, which translates in the potential ability to encapsulate hydrophilic and hydrophobic materials. Since the size of the microcapsules is defined by the droplet used as template the construction of almost perfectly monodisperse microcapsules is within reach, given the current developments in emulsification technology. The choice of size, geometry, and origin of the colloidal particles to be used to assemble the shell, and the means to lock them together, gives control over the targeting and release behavior of the colloidosomes. The requirement that always needs to be met is that particles should have affinity for the both oil and water at the interface, imposing a restriction on the choice of the to-be-used materials. Further, the methods usually applied to lock the colloidal particles to form the shell (e. g. heat up the microcapsule to sinter particles together) were seen as a drawback for the encapsulation of delicate materials such as foods, for which many active components are heat sensitive or volatile. Without significant sintering of the particles the capsule does not have protective properties. The next chapters are therefore devoted to new microencapsulation techniques that complement the colloidosome and the layer-by-layer adsorption routes. In Chapter 3, the first results are presented on microcapsules prepared by sequential electrostatic adsorption of protein fibrils, with approximate dimensions of 1 µm in length and 4 nm in width, and high methoxyl pectin. The encapsulation procedure was carried out at low pH (3. 5), which allowed us to use positively charged oil droplets stabilized with whey protein isolate as templates. Confocal scanning laser microscopy showed that the fibrils adsorbed as an open structure on a layer of pectin in quantities much larger than a monolayer. This was confirmed from the shell thickness determined by scanning electron microscopy. The fibrils remained trapped at the surface after the adsorption of another layer of pectin. It could be shown indirectly that the inclusion of fibrils in the shell had a tremendous impact on the mechanical strength when compared to microcapsules made of layers of protein and pectin only. Since the microcapsules were assembled at low pH, under the action of pH- and ionic strength-dependent electrostatic interactions, we envision that these capsules would survive low pH, and increase their permeability, or totally disorganize, when exposed to a neutral pH. This is further elucidated in the next chapter. In Chapter 4 extensive characterization of the fibril-reinforced microcapsules is reported. Each layer (of fibrils or pectin) added approximately 30 nm to the total thickness, which is considerably more than monolayer coverage, as measured by reflectometry. The microcapsules keep their integrity when exposed to pH below 5. 2 (showing slow dissolution at pH 2), but disintegrate at pH 7 or higher. The response is non linear for increasing number of layers, as it was the case for the mechanical strength of the microcapsules. While microcapsules with 7 or less layers had a similar Young modulus, microcapsules with 8 or more layers had twice that strength, around 0. 6 GPa, comparable with the strength of polymeric microcapsules that are chemically cross-linked. This was related to the defects present in the shells as observed with scanning electron microscope: capsules with 8 or more layers had smooth and defect-free shells, which resulted in high pH stability. The available food grade materials allowed the definition of a second system (to be assembled also at low pH) presented in Chapter 5. A single layer of charged silica particles was adsorbed on sequential layers of whey protein and high methoxyl pectin, therewith reducing the number of adsorption steps. Those pre-adsorbed layers stabilized the adsorbed hydrophilic silica particles that, otherwise, would make a poor colloidosome structure. In this way a highly porous but strong structure that could be easily loaded was obtained. After loading the pores can be closed through the adsorption of additional layers of protein and pectin. The drawback of the two microencapsulation systems described above is that polyelectrolytes needed to be used in excess, and intermediate washing steps to rinse out the non-adsorbed materials were essential. To overcome this we went a step ahead in Chapter 6 using a microfluidic device to carry out layer-by-layer adsorption of up to ten layers of protein fibrils and pectin in continuous mode. The design of the chip is simple and does not require complex infrastructure around it, since it relies only on the right balance of the hydraulic resistances of different sections of the microfluidic circuit to control the dose of the materials for the microcapsules’ assembly. Although issues like surface modification of the chip for long-run operation, and the scale-up of the process to industrially-interesting volumes are still a challenge, we feel that this is an important step forward toward controlled microcapsule formation. The integration of knowledge on self-assembly, of which some examples can be found in this thesis, combined with the search for new food-grade materials that can act synergistically to assemble a smarter and multifunctional shell, and better design of microfluidics for tight control of this process are key to mature microcapsule formation into a real tool for the food industry. Chapter 7 discusses further requirements for the production of reinforced layer-by-layer microcapsules using microfluidics, and closes this thesis with a general discussion of the results, in the light of possible future developments in the area of microencapsulation...|$|E
40|$|Improved {{technology}} {{is needed for}} use in properly managing large agricultural watersheds. Proper watershed management means selecting land uses that are appropriate for each subarea, using erosion control measures where necessary, and applying fertilizers at rates that maximize agricultural production without polluting the environment. Watershed runoff and industrial and municipal effluents pollute streams and reservoirs. Point source pollution (industries and municipalities) can be monitored. Nonpoint-source pollution (watersheds) is widely dispersed and not easily measured. Mathematical models are needed to predict nonpoint-source pollution as affected by watershed characteristics, land use, conservation practices, chemical fertilizers, and climatic variables. Routing models are needed to determine the quality of water as it flows from nonpoint sources through streams and valleys to rivers and large reservoirs. Models are also needed to determine optimal strategies for planning land use, conservation practices, and fertilizer application to maximize agricultural production subject to water quality constraints. Three {{of the most important}} agricultural pollutants are suspended sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen. Robinson [1971] pointed out that sediment is the greatest pollutant of water in terms of volume. Sediment also transports other pollutants, like phosphorus and nitrogen. These two elements are principally involved in lake eutrophication. Frequently algae blooms develop in nutrient-laden water and cause it to have an <b>off-taste</b> and an unpleasant odor. The odor of decaying plants becomes offensive; fish are killed because of reduced dissolved oxygen in the water, and recreation is deterred. The objective of this research was to develop models for use in managing large agricultural watersheds to obtain maximum agricultural production and to maintain water quality standards. The models were designed to: 1. Simulate daily runoff, and sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen yields from small watersheds (areas < 40 km 2) and determine frequency relationships. 2. Route various frequency hydrography and sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen yields from subwatersheds through streams and valleys of large agricultural watersheds (areas < 2500 km 2) to obtain frequency relationships at the entrance of a river or reservoir. 3. Determine strategies that are acceptable to the decision makers (land owners and operators) for planning land use, fertilizer application, and conservation practices on subwatersheds. 4. Determine the optimal strategy for each subwatershed to maximize agricultural production for the entire watershed subject to water quality constraints. Generally, water-quality models are developed by adding chemical modeling components to existing runoff and sediment models because runoff and sediment provide transportation for chemicals. Several conceptual models for predicting chemical yields from small watersheds have been presented [Crawford and Donigian, 1973; Donigian and Crawford, 1976; Frere, et al., 1975; Hagin and Amberger, 1974; Kling, 1974; Johnson and Straub, 1971]. However, these models are not applicable to large watersheds because they have no routing mechanism. For this reason, runoff, sediment, and nutrient models were refined and developed here for application to large watersheds. Probably, the most widely used and accepted model for predicting runoff volume is the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) curve number system [U. S. Soil Conservation Service, 1972]. The SCS model was modified by adding a soil-moisture-index accounting procedure [Williams and Laseur, 1976]. The modified water yield model is considerably more accurate than the original SCS model. On a watershed near Riesel, Texas, the modified model explained 95 % of the variation in monthly runoff as compared with 65 % for the original model. The water-yield model was refined here by replacing the climatic index (lake evaporation) with daily consumptive water use for individual crops. Besides predicting individual storm runoff volumes, it is also necessary to predict hydrographs and to perform flood routing for water quality modeling on large agricultural watersheds. HYMO, a problemoriented computer language for building hydrologic models [Williams and Hann, 1973] was selected to compute hydrographs and perform flood routings. Worldwide use has shown that HYMO is convenient and reliable for extremely varied hydrologic conditions. The Variable Travel Time (VTT) flood routing method [Williams, 1975 a] used in HYMO is about as accurate as an implicit solution of the unsteady flow equations of continuity and motion and is free of convergence problems. The USLE [Wischmeier and Smith, 1965] is the most widely used and accepted erosion model. It can be used to predict long-term average annual sediment yields for watersheds by applying a delivery ratio. However, the USLE was not designed for application to individual storms and is, therefore, not appropriate for individual storm water quality modeling. The USLE was modified [Williams, 1975 c] by replacing the rainfall energy factor with a runoff factor. The modified universal soil loss equation (MUSLE) increased sediment-yield-prediction accuracy, eliminated the need for delivery ratios, and is applicable to individual storms. In tests with data from Riesel, Texas; Chickasha, Oklahoma; Oxford, Mississippi; Treynor, Iowa; Hastings, Nebraska; and Boise, Idaho, MUSLE generally explained 80 % or more of the variation in individual storm sediment yield for each watershed. These tests included 60 watersheds with areas ranging from 0. 01 to 234 km 2 and slopes ranging from less than 1 to about 30 %. The MUSLE was combined with the modified SCS water-yield model and HYMO to form a daily runoff-sediment prediction model [Williams and Berndt, 1976]. Satisfactory results were obtained when the runoff-sediment model was tested with data from 26 watersheds in Texas. The MUSLE is useful in predicting sediment yield from small watersheds (area < 40 km 2), but sediment routing is needed to maintain prediction accuracy on large watersheds with nonuniformly distributed sediment sources. A sediment routing model was developed for large agricultural watersheds [Williams, 1975 b] and has had limited testing. The sediment routing model was refined here and combined with nutrient-loading functions to develop a sediment-phosphorus-nitrogen routing model. Nitrogen and phosphorus loading functions [McElroy, et al., 1976] were developed for use on small agricultural watersheds. The loading functions were designed for predicting long-term average annual phosphorus and nitrogen yields based on predicted sediment yield, nutrient concentration in the soil, and enrichment ratios. However, there is no provision for predicting nitrate yield, since it is not attached to the sediment. There are no functions provided for determining nutrient concentrations in the soil as affected by fertilizer application. Also, relations were not developed for predicting enrichment ratios. Here the loading functions were adapted to individual storm prediction of phosphorus and nitrogen yields from small watersheds. A nitrate component was added and the enrichment ratios were related to particle-size distributions of the soil and the sediment. Since water quality models are not well developed for large agricultural watersheds, little has been done to develop models to determine optimal watershed management strategies subject to water quality constraints. Onishi and Swanson [1974] used linear programming to determine crop systems and practices that are economically optimal on a 4. 86 -km 2 watershed subject to sediment and nitrogen constraints. Wade, et al. [1974] described a model that uses linear programming to minimize national agricultural production costs subject to meeting agricultural production demands and sediment yield constraints. Miller and Gill [1976] used a linear programming model to maximize net revenue to farm firms constrained by acreage limits and soil loss limits. Heady [1976] developed a national model to minimize the cost of producing and transporting farm commodities subject to soil loss and other constraints. None of these models are directly applicable to large agricultural watershed management, because only soil loss or nutrient losses are considered constraints. By including routing models, yields of sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen can be determined and used as constraints. Considering yields to rivers or reservoirs provides more flexibility in management and higher potential agricultural production for the large watershed. Soil loss may not contribute to pollution because it may never reach a point to cause damage (permanent stream or reservoir). Yields of sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus depend upon location of the source within a watershed, hydraulic efficiency of the channels, and the particle-size distribution as well as soil loss. If only soil loss is considered as a constraint, agricultural production cannot be truly maximized. The model presented here uses linear programming to maximize agricultural utility subject to constraints of sediment, phosphorus, and nitrogen yields at the watershed outlet. Decision analysis, as described by Raiffa [1970], is used to determine strategies that are acceptable to the decision makers (landowners and land operators) and to calculate the utility of the strategies. A strategy specifies land use, fertilization rate, and conservation practice. Utility is described with a multiattribute utility function based on gross income, production cost, dependability, and disease, insect, and weed control. Utility theory expresses the decision makers' preferences on a scale from zero to one. This provides for easier and clearer decisions because attributes with various units can be compared and combined directly. To apply decision analysis, each subwatershed is subdivided according to land capability classes. This simplifies the selection of strategies for the decision maker because different land classes have different production and pollution potentials. The number of possible strategies for operating each land capability class within a subwatershed approaches infinity, but the number can be reduced greatly by considering only strategies that are acceptable to the decision makers. Generally, crop production records are not adequate to evaluate the attributes for all strategies. However, the analyst or modeler can evaluate the attributes through the use of subjective probability distributions. Raiffa [1970] suggested special techniques for developing subjective probability distributions by interviewing the decision makers. Each year as the crops are harvested, the probability distributions are revised using Bayes' Theorem [1763] to include the observed data. Since there is usually more than one decision maker per subwatershed, most decisions concerning utility functions and probability distributions are group decisions. Raiffa [1970] suggested using Pareto-optimality in making group decisions. A joint action is Pareto-optimal if no alternative action exists that is at least as acceptable to all and definitely preferred by some. Decision analysis has been used very little in water-resources planning. McCuen [1973] used decision analysis to determine benefits from recreation facilities; Dean and Shih [1973] showed the advantages of subjective decision making for urban water resources development; and Russell [1974] applied decision theory to reservoir operation...|$|E
