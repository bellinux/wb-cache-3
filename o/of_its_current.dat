5|$|Highway130 has {{retained}} most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> route since the mid-1970s, but was longer prior to then, when it extended north of Arthur Street to Oliver Road and then along that road into downtown Thunder Bay, ending {{at what is}} now Water Street. The route was originally designated in late 1955.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 renumbering, NY28 was {{extended}} south from Colliersville to Kingston largely by way <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> alignment along the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike. North of Cooperstown, the route was realigned to follow its modern routing between Cooperstown and Mohawk, then extended into the North Country through Wevertown to Warrensburg along its present alignment. Between Colliersville and Cooperstown, the route remained unchanged. The {{small portion of}} NY10A that did not become part of NY28 in the renumbering was incorporated into NY10.|$|E
5|$|M-34 was {{designated}} and {{signed with the}} beginning of the state highway system around July1, 1919, along a route that extended to either end <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> routing. These western and eastern extensions were added to other highways during the 1920s, shortening M-34 to roughly its current length. A few more changes were made in the mid-1950s and 1960s resulting in the modern routing. M-34 has a short, unsigned sibling, Connector 34, which is better known as Industrial Drive in the Adrian area.|$|E

5|$|The synagogue nearly {{failed in}} the early 20th century, but the 1905 hiring of Israel Goldfarb as rabbi, the {{purchase}} <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> buildings, and the 1908 merger with Talmud Torah Anshei Emes re-invigorated the congregation. The famous composer Aaron Copland celebrated his Bar Mitzvah there in 1913, and long-time Goldman Sachs head Sidney Weinberg was married there in 1920.|$|E
5|$|The {{trunkline}} {{was first}} designated along a portion <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> alignment by 1919. M-61 was extended in segments through 1940, with a truncation {{at the end}} of the 1950s. One change in routing in the 1970s resulted in the current routing of the highway.|$|E

5|$|A {{new trial}} is {{scheduled}} for March 2014, in which Apple will seek to prevent Samsung from selling some <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> devices in the U.S. The case will involve further debate over monetary compensation. In the 2014 lawsuit, Samsung is accused of infringing five of Apple Inc.'s patents in 10 phone and tablet models, while Samsung has responded with a counterclaim, in which it states that two patents for nine phones and tablets have been infringed on by Apple. Jury selection for the trial occurred on March 31, 2014. Samsung stands to gain $6 million if the jury rules in its favor, while Apple is seeking $2 billion in damages and could proceed with similar lawsuits against other Android handset makers, as the relevant patent issues extend beyond Samsung's software technology.|$|E
5|$|As {{he makes}} his way further down the city, Foster {{eventually}} arrives in the abandoned subway tunnels. There he discovers that LINC has grown exponentially, {{to the point where he}} is now half-machine, half-organic entity. However, in order to function, LINC needs a human host to share its brain. The current host is Foster's biological father, who is old and has become severely worn out from his symbiosis with LINC. It is revealed that LINC sent for Foster because, with the death <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> host inevitable, it needed a replacement, and only a blood relative would do. Foster ultimately defeats LINC by plugging Joey (now calling himself Ken) into the mainframe. Joey/Ken is able to take control of the system, and he and Foster set about turning Union City into a utopia.|$|E
5|$|Faced by {{the threat}} of a {{sovereign}} default and potential resulting exit of the eurozone, some final attempts were made by the Greek government in May 2015 to settle an agreement with the Troika about some adjusted terms for Greece to comply with in order to activate the transfer of the frozen bailout funds in its current programme. The Eurogroup recently granted a six-month technical extension <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> bailout programme to Greece (now set to expire by the end of June 2015), which means the time window to complete negotiations and subsequently implement the conditional measures to unlock the remaining bailout transfers now is very short. Expectations are that Greece in addition will need a follow-up support programme starting 1 July 2015. The Troika announced the condition for offering Greece (and begin negotiations about) establishment of a follow-up programme would be a prior successful completion of the re-negotiated current programme.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, NY8 {{was assigned to}} most <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> alignment from Deposit to Hague. The route also extended eastward to Wright (southeast of Ticonderoga) on modern NY9N, NY22, and County Route2 (CR2), where it connected to VTF-10 {{by way of a}} ferry across Lake Champlain. From Clayville to Utica, NY8 was originally routed along Oneida Street before overlapping with NY5 and NY12 along Genesee Street in downtown Utica. After crossing the Mohawk River and the Erie Canal, the three routes separated at the intersection of Herkimer Road, Trenton Road, and Coventry Avenue northeast of downtown. NY8 then followed Coventry Avenue and Walker Road northeast to Deerfield, where NY8 joined its modern alignment.|$|E
5|$|M-62 {{was formed}} before 1924 along a portion <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> routing. The {{trunkline}} {{started at the}} Indiana state line and ran north through Edwardsburg and Cassopolis. The northern terminus was at M-40 (now M-51) in Dowagiac. The southern section was moved {{by the end of}} 1925 to follow a more direct routing between Edwardsburg and the state line. An extension in 1930 moved the northern terminus west into Berrien County, ending in Eau Claire. The final few miles of highway were transferred back in local control around 1957. Before the transfer, M-62 ran concurrently with M-140 west and continued into Eau Claire. After the transfer, M-62 ended at the eastern M-140 junction and the concurrency was removed.|$|E
5|$|M-68 was {{designated}} along a segment <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> roadway in 1936. The roadway connecting Alanson and Indian River {{was given the}} M-68 designation, while US23 was routed between Rogers City and Afton. When US23 was moved to its current lakeshore routing between Rogers City and Cheboygan in 1940, M-33 was extended westerly from Onaway to Afton and north to Cheboygan over the former US23 roadway. The Afton–Onaway segment of M-33 and {{the remainder of the}} former US23 east of Onaway {{was designated}} as a second segment of M-68 as well. The gap between these two segments was eliminated by July 1946.|$|E

5|$|M-72 {{was first}} {{designated}} as a state highway by 1919 along a segment <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> route. It was extended southward in the mid-1920s and westward in the 1940s. One section of the modern highway added to M-72 in 1940 previously existed as M-208 in the 1930s east of Grayling. Another section of highway near Empire was disconnected {{from the rest of}} M-72 until the gap was eliminated later in the decade. All of M-72 was completely paved by the early 1960s. The highway was rerouted in a few places in the 1950s, and the last new segment shifted in 1973 near Kalkaska.|$|E
5|$|Much of NY31 west of Jordan was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} a legislative route from the late 1900s to the early 1920s. NY31 itself was assigned in the mid-1920s, utilizing all of legislative Route30 (modern NY31, NY429, and NY104) west of Rochester and much <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> alignment from Rochester to Lenox. At Lenox, NY31 turned southeast to follow what is now NY316 and NY46 to NY5 in Oneida. It was realigned by 1929 to continue west to Lewiston on Ridge Road and altered in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to continue east to Utica via Verona. With the advent of U.S. Route104 (US104) , NY31 was realigned west of Rochester to follow most of its modern routing.|$|E
5|$|NY28 was {{designated}} in 1924 by the New York State Department of Transportation from Colliersville (near Oneonta) north to Utica. At the time, NY28 began at then-NY9 in Colliersville and headed north on its current alignment to Cooperstown. NY28 separated from its modern routing {{and continued to}} Springfield north of Cooperstown on what is now NY80. Between Springfield and Richfield Springs, the highway utilized what is now US20. At Richfield Springs, the highway turned north onto modern NY167 and followed the current alignments of NY167 and NY168 {{to the village of}} Mohawk. Here, the highway turned westward, using a small portion <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> alignment and the present-day NY5S corridor to connect to Utica by way of Ilion.|$|E

5|$|Route 10 was {{designated}} in 1927 {{to run from}} Jersey City to Dover, following the former Newark and Mount Pleasant Turnpike west of Newark. The route continued east from its present-day routing on current CR 577, Park Avenue, CR 508, and Route 7 to end at US 1/9 at the Tonnele Circle. An alignment of Route 10 farther to the north <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> alignment in Essex County was proposed in 1952; however, it was never constructed with the route being designated to its present alignment a year later. Since 1953, Route 10 has seen improvements that eliminated the Ledgewood Circle at the western terminus in 1998 and improved safety along {{the portion of the}} route in Hanover and East Hanover Townships in the mid-2000s.|$|E
5|$|The genus Phedina {{is thought}} to be an early {{offshoot}} from the main swallow lineage, although their striped plumage suggests a distant relationship with several streaked African Hirundo species. In the past it has sometimes been suggested that Brazza's martin should be moved to its own genus Phedinopsis due to the significant differences in vocalisations and nest type from its relative. The nearest relative of the Phedina martins is the banded martin, Riparia cincta, which appears not to be closely related to the other members <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> genus and resembles Brazza's martin in nesting habits and vocalisations. The current Association of European Rarities Committees (AERC)-recommended practice is to move the banded martin to its own genus as Neophedina cincta, rather than to merge it into Phedina, since the banded martin's larger size, different bill and nostril shape and non-colonial nesting are differences from the other Phedina species.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{was formed}} by July 1, 1919 along two {{discontinuous}} sections <b>of</b> <b>its</b> <b>current</b> corridor. The gap was filled in by 1927, but a second break in the routing {{was created in the}} 1930s. This second interruption in the corridor was eliminated within a year. The various paths that M-46 has followed have been straightened over the intervening years, producing the modern corridor by the 1970s. Other changes have been made to the location of the western terminus in Muskegon, but it has remained fixed in its current location since 1984.|$|E
