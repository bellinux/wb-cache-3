5|$|One {{issue that}} was {{foreseen}} {{as a potential}} problem was the supply of skilled officers to the Army in wartime, and a committee was established in 1906 under Sir Edward Ward to study the matter.

The main recommendation of the former was to reorganise the existing school Cadet Corps and university Rifle Corps, which had been formed on an ad-hoc basis {{as part of the}} broader Volunteer movement, into a uniform force, administered and supported by the War Office.|$|E

5|$|The game's {{development}} {{began in}} 2011.

They also received assistance from Weta Workshop, who advised <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> effects.

5|$|Filming {{began in}} Rome in 1956. The film {{was a low}} budget {{production}} as Lombardo did not care for horror films. Freda and his crew utilized mostly existing sets with only a single scene at the Aniene river filmed outside the studio. The film was shot {{in black and white}} by cinematographer Mario Bava, who felt that that style would better suit the special effects in the film and keep the budget down. Bava worked <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> effects on the film without credit. One of his effects involved Gianna Maria Canale aging make-up that would only be revealed when certain coloured lights were revealed on her. This effect had been done previously in older films such as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931) and contemporary films including The Man Who Turned to Stone (1957).|$|E

5|$|On the 3 January 2014 on SmackDown, the Rhodes Brothers {{defeated}} Luke Harper and Erick Rowan, {{members of}} the Wyatt Family to retain the title and marked their first win of the year. They once again defended the gold <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>special</b> Old School Raw episode when they won against the Real Americans. However, on the 17 January episode of SmackDown, the half-brothers were defeated in a non-title match by the New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) after a distraction from the General Manager of SmackDown Vickie Guerrero. As a result, the Outlaws were named the number one contenders of the title. At the Royal Rumble pre-show, on 26 January the Outlaws defeated the Brotherhood to end their championship reign. Later that day on the Royal Rumble main show, the Rhodes Brothers participated in the Rumble match; Goldust eliminated Cody, but was then quickly eliminated. The following day on Raw, their rematch for the tag team belts was inconclusive when the Brotherhood were attacked by Brock Lesnar. Thus, the Brotherhood received another rematch but in a steel cage; they ended up losing to the Outlaws.|$|E
