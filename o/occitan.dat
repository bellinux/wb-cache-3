25|$|Since the Statute of Autonomy of 1979, Aranese (a dialect of Gascon <b>Occitan)</b> {{has also}} been {{official}} and subject to special protection in Val d'Aran.

25|$|The {{classical}} norm (or less exactly classical orthography) has {{the advantage}} of maintaining a link with earlier stages of the language, and reflects the fact that <b>Occitan</b> is not a variety of French. It is used in all <b>Occitan</b> dialects. It also allows speakers of one dialect of <b>Occitan</b> to write intelligibly for speakers of other dialects (e.g. the <b>Occitan</b> for day is written jorn in the classical norm, but could be jour, joun or journ, depending on the writer's origin, in Mistralian orthography). The <b>Occitan</b> classical orthography and the Catalan orthography are quite similar: They show the very close ties of both languages. The digraphs lh and nh, used in the classical orthography, were adopted by the orthography of Portuguese, presumably by Gerald of Braga, a monk from Moissac, who became bishop of Braga in Portugal in 1047, playing a major role in modernizing written Portuguese using classical <b>Occitan</b> norms.|$|E

25|$|Despite these differences, <b>Occitan</b> and Catalan remain {{more or less}} {{mutually}} comprehensible, {{especially when}} written — more so than either is with Spanish or French, for example, although this is mainly a consequence of using the classical (orthographical) norm of the <b>Occitan,</b> which is precisely focused in showing {{the similarities between the}} <b>Occitan</b> dialects with Catalan. <b>Occitan</b> and Catalan form a common diasystem (or a common Abstandsprache), which is called Occitano-Romance, according to the linguist Pierre Bec. Speakers of both languages share early historical and cultural heritage.|$|E
25|$|The {{exclusion}} of Catalan from the <b>Occitan</b> sphere, even though Catalan is closely related, is justified {{because there has}} been a consciousness of its being different from <b>Occitan</b> since the later Middle Ages and because the elaboration (Ausbau) processes of Catalan and <b>Occitan</b> (including Gascon) have been quite distinct since the 20th century. Nevertheless, other scholars point out that the process that led to the affirmation of Catalan as a distinct language from <b>Occitan</b> started during the period when the pressure to include Catalan-speaking areas in a mainstream Spanish culture was at its greatest.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{preserve}} the traditions of folklore and the <b>Occitan</b> language, the langue d'Oc, two folk groups are based in Rodez.

25|$|The {{question}} of Gascon is similar. Gascon presents {{a number of}} significant differences {{from the rest of the}} language; but, despite these differences, Gascon and other <b>Occitan</b> dialects have very important common lexical and grammatical features, so authors such as Pierre Bec argue that they could never be considered as different as, for example, Spanish and Italian. In addition, Gascon's being included in <b>Occitan</b> despite its particular differences can be justified because there is a common elaboration (Ausbau) process between Gascon and the rest of <b>Occitan.</b> The vast majority of the Gascon cultural movement considers itself as a part of the <b>Occitan</b> cultural movement. And the official status of Val d'Aran (Catalonia, Spain), adopted in 1990, says that Aranese is a part of Gascon and <b>Occitan.</b> A grammar of Aranese by Aitor Carrera, published in 2007 in Lleida, presents the same view.|$|E

25|$|All these {{regional}} {{varieties of}} the <b>Occitan</b> language are written and valid. Standard <b>Occitan,</b> also called <b>occitan</b> larg (i.e., 'wide Occitan') is a synthesis that respects and admits soft regional adaptations (which {{are based on}} the convergence of previous regional koinés). So <b>Occitan</b> can be considered as a pluricentric language. The standardisation process began with the publication of Gramatica occitana segon los parlars lengadocians, grammar of the languedocien dialect, by Louis Alibert (1935), followed by the Dictionnaire occitan-français selon les parlers languedociens (French-Occitan dictionary according to Languedocien) by the same author (1966), completed during the 1970s with the works of Pierre Bec (Gascon), Robèrt Lafont (Provençal) and others. But it has not been achieved yet. It is mostly supported by users of the classical norm. Due to the strong situation of diglossia, some users still reject the standardisation process and do not conceive <b>Occitan</b> as a language that could work just as other standardised languages.|$|E

25|$|A {{comparison}} of the lexical content can find more subtle differences between the languages. For example, <b>Occitan</b> has 128 synonyms related to cultivated land, 62 for wetlands, and 75 for sunshine (Géo). The language went through an eclipse during the Industrial Revolution, as the vocabulary of the countryside became less important. At the same time, it was disparaged as a patois. Nevertheless, <b>Occitan</b> has also incorporated new words into its lexicon to describe the modern world. The <b>Occitan</b> word for web is oèb, for example.|$|E

The mandatory presence of the subject in current French is all the more remarkable that it distinguishes it from most other major contemporary romance languages that require explicit subject.
