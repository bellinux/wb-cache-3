5|$|Pellissier {{returned}} to Chievo for the 2002–03 season, making his Serie A debut on 22 September 2002, {{when he played}} for 46 minutes in a 2–1 loss against Brescia Calcio. On 3 November, Pellissier played as a 63rd-minute substitute for Luigi Beghetto and scored his first goal in Serie A, that was also the <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> match against Parma F.C. During that season, he played 25 matches {{in the league and}} scored five goalstwo of which were scored in consecutive matches against Piacenza and Como. Outside the Italian League, Pellissier appeared four times in the Coppa Italia, and once in the 2002–03 UEFA Cup as a 79th minute substitute for Massimo Marazzina in the second leg of the club's first round match against Red Star Belgrade.|$|E

5|$|There are six {{types of}} quarks, known as flavors: up, down, strange, charm, top, and bottom. Up and down quarks {{have the lowest}} masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks {{through a process of}} {{particle}} decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators). For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of antiparticle, known as an antiquark, that differs from the quark <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.|$|E

Seven of the 10 genera usually recognized as members of this subfamily (excluding Pyroleae) occur there, with 6 of these occurring <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> region.|$|E

25|$|The {{provisional}} {{capital of}} Italy had been Florence since 1865. After defeating the papal forces in 1870, the Italian government {{moved to the}} banks of the Tiber a year later. Victor Emmanuel installed himself in the Quirinal Palace. Rome became once again, {{for the first time in}} thirteen centuries, the capital city of a united Italy. Rome was unusual among capital cities <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> it contained the power of the pope and a small parcel of land (Vatican City) beyond national control. This anomaly was not formally resolved until the Lateran pacts of 1929.|$|E
25|$|After a brief honeymoon {{period in}} the late 1870s had run its course, the SLP saw the {{departure}} of most of its English-speaking members. The party's English-language organ, Bulletin of the Social Labor Movement, appeared monthly from Detroit {{in the shadow of}} the powerful Chicago German-language radical press until it was finally discontinued altogether at the end of 1883. The party was so thoroughly German that it published the stenographic proceedings of its 1884 and 1885 National Conventions <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> language. From 1885 the official organ of the party was a German-language weekly, Der Sozialist. No English-language SLP organ existed from the demise of the Bulletin in 1883 to the establishment of the Workingmen's Advocate in 1886.|$|E
25|$|Regarding the {{traditional}} pull approach to inventory control, {{a number of}} techniques have been developed {{based on the work}} of Ford W. Harris (1913), which came to be known as the economic order quantity (EOQ) model. This model marks the beginning of inventory theory, which includes the Wagner-Within procedure, the newsvendor model, base stock model and the Fixed Time Period model. These models usually involve the calculation of cycle stocks and buffer stocks, the latter usually modeled as a function of demand variability. The economic production quantity (EPQ) differs from the EOQ model <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> it assumes a constant fill rate for the part being produced, instead of the instantaneous refilling of the EOQ model.|$|E

25|$|Acheroraptor temertyorum {{is another}} {{theropod}} from the Hell Creek Formation, named in 2013 for a lower jaw, a maxilla, and some teeth. Acheroraptor was diagnosed by multiple features, including {{the possession of}} ridges on the teeth. Teeth are the only overlapping features between Acheroraptor and Dakotaraptor. However Acheroraptor is significantly smaller, and differs from Dakotaraptor <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> it possesses vertical ridges on the teeth crowns. Andrea Cau noted that though Dakotaraptor is known from individuals of differing sizes, {{some of the smaller}} specimens are also fully mature, and {{it is possible that the}} size difference means Dakotaraptor is simply a different species or size morph of Acheroraptor. A phylogenetic analysis presented by Cau, though relying on fragmentary specimens, did not result in a close relationship between the two.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{decision}} also has attracted defenders by libertarians: the Cato Institute and the scholars Richard Epstein and Randy Barnett, {{who argue that}} Lochner was correct in its protection of economic liberty. Randy Barnett has argued that Lochners presumption in favor of liberty of contract was basically right; {{the decision}} was wrong <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> it perpetuated the misinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment that {{was established in the}} Slaughter-House Cases. According to Barnett, liberty of contract is properly found in the Privileges or Immunities Clause, not in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. David Bernstein, in Rehabilitating Lochner: Defending Individual Rights Against Progressive Reform, argues that the decision in Lochner was well grounded in Supreme Court precedent and that the decision's emphasis on limits to the states' police powers informed the Court's early civil liberties and civil rights cases.|$|E
25|$|Other invitees {{are chosen}} by the host country, usually one or two {{countries}} from its own region. For example, South Korea invited Singapore.

Previously, the Netherlands had a similar status to Spain while the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union would also receive an invitation, but <b>only</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> capacity and not as their own state's leader (such as the Czech premiers Mirek Topolánek and Jan Fischer during the 2009 summits).|$|E
