To investigate the interaction between hydrodynamics and seagrass plants, Zostera noltii meadows were exposed {{to a range of}} combinations of waves and flow in a flume. Velocity profiles were obtained to observe the evolution of hydrodynamic forcing due to the presence of a seagrass canopy. Observations under flow without waves agreed with those of previous studies and showed that turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) {{at the top of the}} canopy increased with increasing flow velocity as well as with distance from the leading edge. The highest TKE values were achieved for the highest flow velocity without waves, and the presence of waves generally led to reduced TKE values. Profiles of time-averaged downstream velocity were not affected by the presence of waves. However, flow reduction near the bed increased with higher seagrass density, resulting in an S-shaped profile for the highest density and flow velocity.

The data consist of substantive observations of small-scale processes collected at high {{spatial and temporal}} resolution under irregular wave forcing, typical of coastal environments. Acoustic measurements were made of water velocities, bed forms, and suspended sediment concentration over plane and rippled beds. During each rippled bed experiment, measurements were taken over the crests of steep sided ripples, above which flow separation was considered likely to occur. Above the ripple crests, a strong intrawave variation in the near-bed suspended sediment, indicative of vortex formation and shedding, was observed to dominate wave half cycles where the <b>orbital</b> <b>diameter</b> was greater than 1. 2 times the ripple wavelength lambda. The irregular waves were parameterized with a significant wave height H-s and a significant <b>orbital</b> <b>diameter</b> d(0 s).

40|$|In {{addition}} to collisions and gravitational forces, {{it is now}} becoming widely acknowledged that photon recoil forces and torques from the asymmetric reflection and thermal re-radiation of sunlight are primary mechanisms that govern the rotational evolution of an asteroid. The Yarkovsky-O'Keefe-Radzievskii-Paddack (YORP) effect causes changes in the rotation rate and pole direction of an irregularly shaped asteroid. We present a simple Monte Carlo method to estimate the range of YORP-rotational-accelerations acting on a near-Earth asteroid (NEA) without knowledge of its detailed shape, and to estimate its detectability using light-curve observations. The method requires knowledge of an asteroid's orbital properties and size, and assumes that the future observational circumstances of an asteroid have already been thought through. It is verified by application to the observational circumstances of the seven YORP-investigated asteroids, and is then applied to 540 NEAs with NEOWISE and/or other diameter measurements, and to all NEAs using MPCORB absolute magnitudes. The YORP-detectability {{is found to be}} a strong function of the combined asteroid <b>orbital</b> and <b>diameter</b> properties, and is independent of the rotation period for NEAs that don't have very fast or slow rotation rates.

40|$|Wave-formed rippled {{sediment}} {{beds are}} {{extremely important to}} the processes that act on or across the sediment-water interface. Ripples increase the exchange of materials between the sediment and the water column, enhance sediment transport rates, and act to increase the dissipation of waves by increasing the hydraulic roughness of the seafloor. Previous research has, however, failed {{to take into account}} the substantial spatial and temporal variation rippled beds display when formed under real sea conditions. Based on a set of laboratory experiments a spectral method to predict and model rippled beds has been developed. Through the use of the rippled surface's spectral density function the spatial and temporal variability of the rippled surface can be taken into account with greater efficiency. A prediction method for the equilibrium ripple spectrum was developed based on a nondimensional spectral form, which utilised the peak <b>orbital</b> excursion <b>diameter</b> and the 50 th percentile grain size diameter of the sediment bed. The method provided an effective technique to predict ripple parameters with the same degree of accuracy achievable at small scale as more accepted ripple prediction methods. A new method was derived to model the changes a rippled bed undergoes as it actively evolves between two given equilibrium states due to a change in surface wave conditions. The evolution of a rippled bed can be described mathematically in exactly the same way as a rippled bed growing from a flat bed condition. The method allows any bed to be modelled through time if the flow conditions and sediment properties are known. There is little advantage in using the spectral method to predict rippled beds when they are in equilibrium with the flow conditions. The main benefit of the spectral method comes when attempting to model rippled beds evolving under changed flow conditions. In the same way as the parameterisation of surface waves in terms of their spectral density function has increased the ability to model wind generated wave fields, studies of rippled beds would benefit from the increased detail and ease the spectral method brings.

This relationship is simple for vortex ripples of high steepness but is problem-atical for the low-steepness forms known as post-vortex, rolling-grain or anorbital ripples. The existence field for wave ripples is between the threshold velocity for sediment movement and the onset of sheet flow, most low-steepness forms occurring close to the bed planation threshold. A range of max imum period of formative waves can be obtained using combinations of <b>orbital</b> <b>diameter</b> and orbital velocity, assuming linear wave theory to be a reasonable approximation. Probable wave heights, wave lengths and water depths can be investigated using the transformation of wave parameters in shallowing waters and the constraints on wave dimensions provided by the wave-breaking condition.

Previous Space Syntax research in inner city contexts has used topological distance minimisation together with road capacity or compared metric, topological and geometric distance showing a high degree of association with vehicular flow level using spatially dense counts dataset. It has been shown that road network geometry strongly influence the traffic flow pattern through quantifiable properties of the network geometry, where topological distance minimisation and effective road width account {{for the majority of the}} variance in flows from street to street (r 2 = 0. 8). Such studies have focused on high-density urban environments and street network. The originality of this paper is to examine this relationship in the context of sparsely built suburban areas and motorways, trunk roads and feeder roads. The case of Nantes conurbation is used. Population density, activity locations, shop and supermarket locations and commuters’ journey length distribution are mapped and analysed qualitatively. The spatial model covers an extent of 570 km 2 - including a 12 km <b>diameter</b> <b>orbital</b> motorway, several surrounding communities, and more than 700, 000 inhabitants. This paper compares generic path selection link assignment using three different distance minimisation approaches: metric, topologic and angular. Using an automated vehicular counts (156) dataset on motorways, trunk and main roads, accounting for more than 3. 500, 000 vehicles/day, it was found that the correlation between topological closeness compounded with road capacity and vehicular flow levels increased with every step upwards in radius, peaking at r 2 0. 84 at radius-n. The study uncovered for the first time the role of axial entropy in relation to the motorway network. The results of this study suggest that road network geometry analysis can be a powerful predictor in low-density environments with a relatively sparse count dataset. The paper concludes with a discussion on the use of such analysis to strategically assess vehicular network design in relation to road network performance and interface, journey length reduction and road network legibility...|$|R
