5|$|Women {{are neither}} victims of {{deceitful}} men nor overdefensive virgins, but individuals who {{can choose to}} 'bestow' their favours <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who will 'enjoy' them. In the earliest examples of the redefinition that develops throughout Fielding's works, virtue is no longer simply virginity, but something malleable and powerful {{in the hands of}} a woman granted the agency and intelligence to determine her own sexuality.|$|E

5|$|Candide and Cacambo {{eventually}} reach Suriname, {{where they}} split up: Cacambo travels to Buenos Aires to retrieve Lady Cunégonde, while Candide prepares {{to travel to}} Europe to await the two. Candide's remaining sheep are stolen, and Candide is fined heavily by a Dutch magistrate for petulance over the theft. Before leaving Suriname, Candide feels in need of companionship, so he interviews a number of local {{men who have been}} through various ill-fortunes and settles <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named Martin.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, {{seven years}} {{after the release of}} the {{original}} film, a student short film serving as an unauthorized sequel was made by amateur filmmaker Don Glut, after he discovered the Sun Demon mask in Bob Burns' collection. Filmed in black and white with a running time of three-and-a-half minutes, Wrath of the Sun Demon starred Burns as the Sun Demon. The short film was made {{with the support of the}} University of Southern California, where Glut was a student at the time. The plot centered <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> (presumably McKenna) transforming into the Sun Demon and terrorizing several people before falling to his death off a cliff. The film also starred John Schuyler as the film's hero and Burns' wife Kathy.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{oral traditions}} about the castle survive. One of these {{involves}} a child prisoner within the castle, who escaped, throwing {{the key to}} her dungeon into a nearby field, sometimes argued to be an outcrop of land north-west of the castle, which from then onwards was infertile. Another centres <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> called Gallon who was left {{in charge of the}} castle by Margaret of Anjou and entrusted with a set of valuables; captured by the Yorkists, he escaped and later returned to reclaim six Venetian glasses. The historian Katrina Porteous has noted that in the 14th century there are records of receivers and bailiffs at the castle called Galoun, potentially linked to the origins of the Gallon of this story.|$|E

5|$|The {{trials that}} the Donner Party {{had so far}} endured {{resulted}} in splintered groups, each looking out for themselves and distrustful of the others. Grass was becoming scarce, and the animals were steadily weakening. To relieve the load of the animals, everyone was expected to walk. Keseberg ejected Hardkoop from his wagon, telling the elderly man {{that he had to}} walk or die. A few days later, Hardkoop sat next to a stream, his feet so swollen that they split open, and he was not seen again. William Eddy pleaded with the others to find Hardkoop, but they all refused, swearing that they would waste no more resources <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who was almost 70 years old.|$|E
5|$|The Flag of His Country is a 1910 American silent short drama film {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The patriotic film focuses <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> aptly named Walter North who sides with the Union and whilst his wife sides with the Confederacy in the American Civil War. The family is reunited thirty years later at a Grand Army of the Republic reunion through the actions of their grandchild. Little {{is known about the}} production and cast of the film, but the role of granddaughter was played by Marie Eline. Released on July 1, 1910, the film took place within living memory of the war and a reviewer in the The Moving Picture World specifically noted that the film would not offend its audience members. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match in}} October {{was on the}} 4th; it was an away match at Parque de Jogos, Moreirense's home ground. Benfica won 4–1, which was their largest win all season. Camacho {{attributed}} the team's success to an improvement in the conversion rate of the attacking line. After a break for international matches, Benfica returned with the second leg of the UEFA Cup on the 15th. They dominated the match, and only a strong performance from Silvio Proto allowed the Belgians to leave with only a goal conceded. Two days later, Benfica announced they were rescheduling the game against Marítimo from 25 October to 12 November, due to the opening game of the new Estádio da Luz on the same day. On 19 October, Benfica ended their six-month spell at Estádio Nacional with a match against Gil Vicente. Benfica scored first but Gil Vicente equalized three minutes later, unsettling the home side. In the second half, Simão scored the winning goal for Benfica. Camacho acknowledged that Benfica struggled after conceding Gil Vicente's goal, adding {{that it was a}} normal behaviour in football. On the 25th, Benfica opened its brand new Estádio da Luz, attracting a sell-out crowd against Nacional Montevideo. Benfica won 2–1, with Nuno Gomes scoring twice. On the following Wednesday, Benfica opened the redeveloped Estádio Cidade de Coimbra, in a game transferred from August. Simão put <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> of the match performance, leading the team to a 3–1 win to Académica.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} sees Little Mix {{adopting}} a new heavier look including leather outfits, bullet chains and gothic makeup, and explores themes of jealousy and obsession. It features the group hunting down {{men who have}} wronged them. Filmed in comic book movie style, Little Mix play female assassins who stalk and then kidnap men they are obsessed with. In one scene, Perrie Edwards is angrily driving a car while next to a male passenger who is bound and gagged. Edwards sports glossy red lipstick and a biker jacket, keeping {{her eyes on the}} road and paying no mind to the camera as wind blows through her hair. Jade Thirlwall is seen stalking a man outside his bedroom window. Standing outside the window ledge, Thirlwall spies <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who captured her heart. Thirlwall wears metallic silver and black striped highwaisted trousers, with a white shirt, black bow tie and braces. Jesy Nelson's scene {{is similar to that of}} Edwards. Nelson races to her destination in a vintage convertible with a lace visor covering her eyes as police sirens flash behind her. In another scene, Leigh-Anne Pinnock masterminds the story's plots in a secret room with a wall of evidence the group has compiled, of which includes maps and clippings.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, American novelists were expanding fiction to encompass both high and low life and sometimes connected to the naturalist school of realism. In her stories and novels, Edith Wharton (1862–1937) scrutinized the upper-class, Eastern-seaboard society in which she had grown up. One of her finest books, The Age of Innocence, centers <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who chooses to marry a conventional, socially acceptable woman rather than a fascinating outsider.|$|E
25|$|Security was {{frequently}} a problem, {{particularly in the}} club's latter years. There were several shootings {{inside and outside the}} club, and relations with the police and licensing authorities became troubled. When local magistrates and police visited the club in 1997, they witnessed a near-fatal assault <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> in the streets outside when 18-year-old Andrew Delahunty was hit over the head from behind with what looked like a metal bar before being pushed into the path of an on-coming car.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} couple of decades there was no {{traditional}} marriage in the kibbutz. If a man and woman wanted to get married, they went to the housing office and requested a room together. Not having traditional marriage was seen as a way to dissolve the patriarchy and give women their own standing without depending <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> (economically or socially) and was also viewed as a positive thing for the community as a whole, as communal life was the main aspect of the kibbutz.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{pressure}} from film studios wanting to increase their production, as the major networks began airing theatrically released films, ABC joined CBS and NBC in broadcasting films on Sunday nights in 1962, with {{the launch of the}} ABC Sunday Night Movie, which debuted a year behind its competitors and was initially presented in black-and-white. Despite a significant increase in viewership (with its audience share having increased to 33% from the 15% share it had in 1953), ABC remained in third place; the company had a total revenue of $15.5 million, a third of the revenue pulled in by CBS at the same period. To catch up, ABC followed up The Flintstones with another animated series from Hanna-Barbera, The Jetsons, which debuted on September 23, 1962 as the first television series to be broadcast in color on the network. On April 1, 1963, ABC debuted the soap opera General Hospital, which would go on to become the television network's long-running entertainment program. That year also saw the premiere of The Fugitive (on September 17), a drama series centering <b>on</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> on the run after being accused of committing a murder he did not commit.|$|E
