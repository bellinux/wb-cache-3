40|$|Multiwavelength {{observations}} of Galactic black hole transients have {{opened a new}} path to understanding the physics of the innermost parts of the accretion flows. While the processes giving rise to their X-ray continuum have been studied extensively, the emission in the optical <b>and</b> infrared (<b>OIR)</b> energy bands was less investigated and remains poorly understood. The standard accretion disc, which {{may contribute to the}} flux at these wavelengths, is not capable of explaining a number of observables: the infrared excesses, fast <b>OIR</b> variability <b>and</b> a complicated correlation with the X-rays. It was suggested that these energy bands are dominated by the jet emission, however, this scenario does not work in a number of cases. We propose here an alternative, namely that most of the OIR emission is produced by the extended hot accretion flow. In this scenario, the OIR bands are dominated by the synchrotron radiation from the non-thermal electrons. An additional contribution is expected from the outer irradiated part of the accretion disc heated by the X-rays. We discuss properties of the model and compare them to the data. We show that the hot-flow scenario is consistent with many of the observed spectral data, at the same time naturally explaining X-ray timing properties, fast <b>OIR</b> variability <b>and</b> its correlation with the X-rays.

40|$|Background: The {{mechanisms}} of pathological retinal neovascularization (RNV) remain unknown. Several microRNAs {{were reported to}} be involved in the process of RNV. Oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) is a useful model to investigate RNV. Our present work explored the expression and the role of microRNA- 128 (miR- 218) in oxygen-induced RNV. Methods: OIR was used to establish RNV model. The expression level of miR- 218 in the retina from OIR mice was assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Fluorescein angiography was performed in retinae of <b>OIR</b> mice, <b>and</b> RNV was quantified by hematoxylin and eosin staining to evaluate the effect of pCDH-CMV-miR- 218 intravitreal injection on RNV in OIR mice. Roundabout 1 (Robo 1) expression was detected by Western blotting in mouse retinal vascular endothelial cells expressing a high or low level of miR- 218 and retinal tissues from OIR mice. Cell migration was evaluated by scratch wound assay. Results: In OIR mice, the expression level of miR- 218 was significantly down-regulated (P = 0. 006). Retinal Robo 1 expression was significantly increased at both mRNA and protein levels (P = 0. 001, 0. 008; respectively). miR- 218 intravitreal injection inhibited retinal angiogenesis in <b>OIR</b> mice, <b>and</b> the restoration of miR- 218 in retina led to down-regulation of Robo 1. Conclusions: Our experiments showed that restoration of miR- 218 inhibited retinal angiogenesis via targeting Robo 1. MiR- 218 contributed to the inhibition of retinal angiogenesis and miR- 218 might be a new therapeutic target for preventing RNV...|$|R

5000|$|The {{formation}} of the infinitive in the Romance languages reflects that in their ancestor, Latin, almost all verbs had an infinitive ending with -re (preceded by one of various thematic vowels). For example, in Italian infinitives end in -are, -ere, -rre (rare), or -ire (which is still identical to the Latin forms), and in -arsi, -ersi, -rsi, -irsi for the reflexive forms. In Spanish and Portuguese, infinitives end in -ar, -er, or -ir, while similarly in French they typically end in -re, -er, <b>oir,</b> <b>and</b> -ir. In Romanian, both short and long-form infinitives exist; the so-called [...] "long infinitives" [...] end in -are, -ere, -ire and in modern speech are used exclusively as verbal nouns. Verbs that cannot be converted into the nominal long infinitive are very rare). The [...] "short infinitives" [...] used in verbal contexts (e.g. after an auxiliary verb) have the endings -a,-ea, -e, and -i (basically removing the ending in [...] "-re"). In Romanian, the infinitive is usually replaced by a clause containing the conjunction să plus the subjunctive mood. The only verb that is modal in common modern Romanian is the verb a putea, to be able to. However, in popular speech the infinitive after a putea is also increasingly replaced by the subjunctive.|$|E

40|$|Aim of this {{research}} is to draw up a proprietary BIM guideline to help buildings owners in managing their assets using BIM models in connection with databases, so to solve two recurring issues: a) many people in the maintenance and operation supply chain are unable to use or {{do not have access to}} BIM authoring tools; and b) difficulties in storing life cycle data in a BIM model. After analyzing the current maintenance management procedures and the documents management system of the client, the BIM adoption procedure has been planned. This consists of some steps: a) analysis of organizations requirements (<b>OIRs)</b> <b>and</b> of owner’s database of maintenance operations; b) setting up a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to identify building or system components; c) listing data required for each object in the WBS starting from what collected in point a) and using COBie guides as a background base; d) digitalization of all client information about building asset. The connection between high Level of Information BIM models and a database allows the client to manage complex activities like, for example, scheduling and recording maintenance operations, store and update technical documents (pictures, datasheets, warranties, etc.) and setting up automatic alerts for recurring control activities. Due to the extent of the topic, there is a great variety of stakeholders and professionals involved, so the guideline must be able to cope with different requirements, input and output, while keeping data updated and consistent. Many different scenarios have been analysed so to avoid ambiguity and personal users’ choices (in opposition to organization’s ones). The application of the developed procedures and tools has been made using Autodesk Revit and Microsoft Access because these are among the most used BIM and database software tools in Italy and because the connection between the BIM model and the database is very reliable when using these tools...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{identify}} altered {{patterns of}} retinal mRNA expression in a rat model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Methods: Sprague-Dawley rats from P 2 to P 14 {{were exposed to}} hyperoxia (80 % oxygen) to induce <b>OIR</b> <b>and</b> then returned to normoxic conditions. Control rats were sustained in room air. Retinal gene expression between the rats of <b>OIR</b> <b>and</b> the controls was compared using cDNA microarray analysis. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to verify the microarray results. Results: Among a total of 12, 731 cDNAs analyzed by mircroarray, 13 genes were strongly up- or down-regulated (> 2 -fold change over controls) in the OIR rats. We found {{a significant increase in}} expression of 10 genes (CaM-kinase inhibitor; acidic nuclear phosphoprotein 32 family, member A; vascular endothelial growth factor; interferon α-inducible protein 27 -like; similar to enthoprotin, epsin 4, clathrin interacting protein; nidogen [entactin]; tubulin, β 5; fibrillin- 1; spectrin β 2; and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 2) and a significant decrease in expression of 3 genes (myelin-associated oligodendrocytic basic protein, heat shock protein, and decorin) in OIR rats compared to controls.

40|$|Pathological ocular neovascularization, {{caused by}} {{diabetic}} retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, or retinopathy of prematurity, {{is a leading}} cause of blindness, yet much remains to be learned about its underlying causes. Here we used oxygen-induced retinopathy (<b>OIR)</b> <b>and</b> laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) to assess the contribution of the metalloprotease-disintegrin ADAM 9 to ocular neovascularization in mice. Pathological neovascularization in both the <b>OIR</b> <b>and</b> CNV models was significantly reduced in Adam 9 −/− mice compared to wild-type controls. In addition, the level of ADAM 9 expression was strongly increased in endothelial cells in pathological vascular tufts in the OIR model. Moreover, tumor growth from heterotopically injected B 16 F 0 melanoma cells was reduced in Adam 9 −/− mice compared to controls. In cell-based assays, the overexpression of ADAM 9 enhanced the ectodomain shedding of EphB 4, Tie- 2, Flk- 1, CD 40, VCAM, and VE-cadherin, so the enhanced expression of ADAM 9 could potentially affect pathological neovascularization by increasing the shedding of these and other membrane proteins from endothelial cells. Finally, we provide the first evidence for the upregulation of ADAM 9 -dependent shedding by reactive oxygen species, which in turn are known to {{play a critical role in}} OIR. Collectively, these results suggest that ADAM 9 could be an attractive target for the prevention of proliferative retinopathies, CNV, and cancer...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Pathological fundus {{angiogenesis}} is a {{major cause}} of vision loss in retina diseases. Endostatin, a C-terminal fragment of collagen XVIII, is an endogenous anti-angiogenic protein. The present study aimed to investigate the in vitro and in vivo anti-angiogenic properties of two proteins: an N-terminal H 1 D/H 3 D mutant endostatin (M-ES) and a polyethylene glycol propionaldehyde (PEG) covalent M-ES (PEG-M-ES). Methods: M-ES and PEG-M-ES properties were characterized in vitro using a zinc ion binding assay and a stability test. Activity assays, including migration, proliferation, and tube formation assays, were performed with human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Mouse oxygen-induced retinopathy (<b>OIR)</b> <b>and</b> choroidal neovascularization (CNV) models were used to evaluate in vivo anti-angiogenic effects. In addition, a rabbit model was used to study the retinal pharmacokinetic profile following an intravitreal injection. Results: The results indicated that the H 1 D/H 3 D mutations of endostatin reduced the zinc binding capacity of M-ES and facilitated PEG covalent binding. PEG-M-ES was more stable and persisted longer in the retina compared with M-ES. The in vitro studies demonstrated that M-ES and PEG-M-ES inhibited HRMEC and HUVEC proliferation, migration, and tube formation more efficiently than ES. In vivo, a single intravitreal injection of M-ES and PEG-M-ES significantly decreased neovascularization in both the <b>OIR</b> <b>and</b> CNV animal models...|$|E
40|$|The {{general picture}} that emerged {{by the end}} of 1990 s from a large set of optical and X-ray, {{spectral}} and timing data was that the X-rays are produced in the innermost hot part of the accretion flow, while the optical/infrared (OIR) emission is mainly produced by the irradiated outer thin accretion disc. Recent multiwavelength observations of Galactic black hole transients show that the situation is not so simple. Fast variability in the OIR band, OIR excesses above the thermal emission and a complicated interplay between the X-ray <b>and</b> the <b>OIR</b> light curves imply that the OIR emitting region is much more compact. One of the popular hypotheses is that the jet contributes to the <b>OIR</b> emission <b>and</b> even is responsible for the bulk of the X-rays. However, this scenario is largely ad hoc and is in contradiction with many previously established facts. Alternatively, the hot accretion flow, known to be consistent with the X-ray spectral and timing data, is also a viable candidate to produce the OIR radiation. The hot-flow scenario naturally explains the power-law like OIR spectra, fast <b>OIR</b> variability <b>and</b> its complex relation to the X-rays if the hot flow contains non-thermal electrons (even in energetically negligible quantities), which are required by the presence of the MeV tail in Cyg X- 1. The presence of non-thermal electrons also lowers the equilibrium electron temperature in the hot flow model to < 100 keV, making it more consistent with observations. Here we argue that any viable model should simultaneously explain a large set of spectral and timing data and show that the hybrid (thermal/non-thermal) hot flow model satisfies most of the constraints.

40|$|It is now {{established}} that thermal disc emission and non-thermal jet emission can both {{play a role}} at optical/infrared (OIR) wavelengths in X-ray transients. The spectra of the jet and disc components differ, as do their dependence on mass accretion properties. Here we demonstrate that the OIR colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) {{of the evolution of}} the X-ray transient XTE J 1550 - 564 in outburst can be used to separate the disc from the jet. Monitoring in two wavebands is all that is required. This outburst in 2000 was well studied, and both disc and jet were known to contribute. During the outburst the data follow a well defined path in the CMD, describing what would be expected from a heated single-temperature blackbody of approximately constant area, except when the data appear redder than this track. This is due to the non-thermal jet component which dominates the OIR moreso during hard X-ray states at high luminosities, and which is quenched in the soft state. The CMD therefore shows state-dependent hysteresis, in analogy with (but not identical to) the well established X-ray hardness-intensity diagram of black hole transients. The blackbody originates in the X-ray illuminated, likely unwarped, outer accretion disc. We show that the CMD can be approximately reproduced by a model that assumes various correlations between X-ray, <b>OIR</b> disc <b>and</b> <b>OIR</b> jet fluxes. We find evidence for the OIR jet emission to be decoupled from the disc near the peak of the hard state. Comment: MNRAS accepted; 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
