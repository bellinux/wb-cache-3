5|$|Pyramid B6 {{enclosed}} {{the southern}} {{portion of the}} west side of the Group B plaza. It is very poorly preserved and the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> has collapsed, leaving only the lower walls. Archaeological investigation revealed that the final version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> had been built over a preceding version.|$|E
5|$|The core <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> is made {{of roughly}} hewn {{limestone}} blocks {{similar to those of}} the main pyramid. These were disposed in two layers and finally clad with fine Tura limestone which fell victim to stone robbers. Consequently, the poor quality pyramid core was exposed and degradated rapidly with only the two lowest layers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> still visible today.|$|E
5|$|The main {{innovation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> of Unas is {{the first}} appearance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pyramid</b> Texts, {{one of the oldest}} religious texts in Egypt to have survived to this day. In doing so, Unas initiated a tradition that would be followed in the pyramid of the kings and queens of the Sixth to Eighth Dynasties, {{until the end of the}} Old Kingdom circa 200 years later.|$|E

5|$|The pyramid core was {{constructed}} in a step-like structure, a construction technique {{similar to that of}} the 4th dynasty although the building material was of a significantly lower quality. The outer casing <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> was made of fine Tura limestone which certainly ensured Userkaf's construction an appearance {{similar to that of the}} glorious 4th Dynasty pyramids. There was however no red granite paneling over the lower part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> as in the case <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pyramid</b> of Menkaure.|$|E

5|$|In total 283 magical spells, {{also known}} as utterances, were carved and the signs painted blue {{on the walls of}} the corridor, antechamber, and burial chamber of Unas' pyramid. They {{constitute}} the most complete rendition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pyramid</b> Texts existing today. These spells were intended to help the king in overcoming hostile forces and powers in the Underworld and thus join with the sun god Ra, his divine father in the afterlife. By writing the texts on the walls <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> internal chambers, the architects of Unas' pyramid ensured that the king would benefit from their potency even if the funerary cult was to cease.|$|E

5|$|Soon, however, Pei and {{his team}} won the support of several key {{cultural}} icons, including the conductor Pierre Boulez and Claude Pompidou, widow of former French President Georges Pompidou, after whom another controversial museum was named. In an attempt to soothe public ire, Pei took a suggestion from then-mayor of Paris Jacques Chirac and placed a full-sized cable model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> in the courtyard. During the four days of its exhibition, an estimated 60,000people visited the site. Some critics eased their opposition after witnessing the proposed scale <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid.</b>|$|E

5|$|The layer pyramid {{was first}} {{examined}} and its surroundings explored in 1839 by John Shae Perring. Soon after, in 1848, the pyramid {{was identified as}} such by Karl Richard Lepsius, who listed it as number XIV in his pioneering list of pyramids. Around 40 years later, in 1886, Gaston Maspero unsuccessfully searched for {{the entrance of the}} subterranean passages <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid,</b> which was discovered in 1896 by Jacques de Morgan. The latter undertook excavations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> but stopped after clearing the first few steps of the descending stairway.|$|E
5|$|The pyramid {{does not}} have {{internal}} chambers, the chambers being located underground. These were constructed in a deep open ditch dug before the pyramid construction started and only later covered by the pyramid. The entrance to the underground chambers is located north <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> from a pavement in the court in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> face. This {{is different from the}} 4th dynasty pyramids for which the entrance to the internal chambers is located on the pyramid side itself. The entrance was hewn into the bedrock and floored and roofed with large slabs of white limestone, most of which have been removed in modern times.|$|E
5|$|A {{collision}} with purple enemies is fatal to the character, whereas the green enemies {{are removed from}} the board upon contact. Colored balls occasionally appear at the second row of cubes and bounce downward; contact with a red ball is lethal to Q*bert, while contact with a green one immobilizes the on-screen enemies for a limited time. Multicolored floating discs on either side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> serve as an escape from danger, particularly Coily. When Q*bert jumps on a disc, it transports him to the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid.</b> If Coily is in close pursuit of the character, he will jump after Q*bert and fall to his death, awarding bonus points. This causes all enemies and balls on the screen to disappear, though they start to return after a few seconds.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{causeway}} was a large hall leading to a pillared open court surrounded by magazine chambers. The court led into the mortuary temple proper which housed statues of the king and where the offerings to the deceased took place. This was immediately adjacent to the eastern side <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid,</b> which was surrounded by an enclosure wall defining the sacred space. At the southeast corner of the enclosure was a small satellite pyramid for the Ka of the king. The internal chambers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> were entered in 1881 by Gaston Maspero, who thus discovered the pyramid texts. The burial chamber housed nothing but a black basalt sarcophagus sunk into the floor and a canopic chest. The sarcophagus proved to contain scattered bones, which may belong to Unas.|$|E

5|$|By July 1993 {{the game}} was behind schedule; only the {{above-ground}} portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> were complete.

5|$|Further {{investigations}} {{were then}} performed in 1900 by Alessandro Barsanti, who uncovered the {{vertical access shaft}} leading to the burial chamber. Barsanti, seeing that several corridors and chambers were seemingly unfinished and that all were completely devoid of artefacts, deemed that the pyramid had never been used. Shortly after, in 19101911, George Reisner and Clarence S. Fisher worked on the site, excavating {{the north and east}} exteriors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> as well as the cemeteries surrounding it. The dimensions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pyramid</b> as estimated by Barsanti, Reisner and Fisher differ greatly and even the numbers of subterranean galleries they report are in disagreement. Unfortunately, the pyramid lies within a restricted military area since 1970 and consequently no excavation has been undertaken there since Reisner and Fisher's superficial work, leaving the structures beneath the pyramid in doubt. Furthermore, the pyramid is now sanded up, hampering modern estimations of its dimensions.|$|E
