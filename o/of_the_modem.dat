25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the mark or space input state. In this case the transmitting part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> is bypassed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Devices and {{associated}} applications are increasingly {{connected to a}} variety of smart modems that have dynamically varying link characteristics. For example, incoming and outgoing link rates can be varied over time with adaptive coding and modulation to suit the channel characteristics. In addition, those links may go up and down due to a variety <b>of</b> factors. <b>The</b> link rate and conditions offered by <b>the</b> <b>modem</b> to connected devices {{and associated}} applications therefore vary. In order to autonomously condition traffic and allow the network to get <b>the</b> most out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>modem's</b> link capacity, <b>the</b> upstream devices and applications need to be informed <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>modem's</b> link conditions. This becomes a form of cognitive networking. This paper will discuss the problem and present a simple protocol {{that can be used to}} provide upstream devices and applications with downstream link conditions. While th...|$|R

25|$|The {{transmission}} speed is {{a characteristic of}} the teleprinter while the shift (the difference between the tones representing mark and space) is a characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>modem.</b> These two parameters are therefore independent, provided they have satisfied the minimum shift size for a given {{transmission speed}}. Electronic teleprinters can readily operate {{in a variety of}} speeds, but mechanical teleprinters require the change of gears in order to operate at different speeds.|$|E
25|$|Early modems were {{generally}} very simple devices using acoustic couplers to handle telephone operation. The user would first {{pick up the}} phone, dial a number, then press the handset into rubber cups on the top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>modem.</b> Disconnecting {{at the end of}} a call required the user to pick up the handset and return it to the phone. Examples of direct-connecting modems did exist, and these often allowed the host computer to send it commands to answer or hang up calls, but these were very expensive devices used by large banks and similar companies.|$|E

At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>MoDem</b> Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front Gérard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%.
