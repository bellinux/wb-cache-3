5|$|The small landowner-cultivators {{formed the}} {{majority}} of the Han tax base; this revenue was threatened during the latter half of Eastern Han when many peasants fell into debt and were forced to work as farming tenants for wealthy landlords. The Han government enacted reforms in order to keep small landowner-cultivators <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and on their own farms. These reforms included reducing taxes, temporary remissions of taxes, granting loans and providing landless peasants temporary lodging and work in agricultural colonies until they could recover from their debts.|$|E

He had also expressed desire to amalgamate the existing city of Edmonton {{with the city of}} Strathcona, which was divided from Edmonton by the North Saskatchewan River, situated on the south. Though former councillor William Harold Clark was urged to run by a group of citizens, Armstrong would be the only nominated mayoral candidate when nomination deadline day came, and thus he was acclaimed mayor; the first occurrence since Kenneth W. MacKenzie was acclaimed in 1900. Amongst his supporters for his candidacy were outgoing mayor Robert Lee and former mayor Charles May.|$|E
5|$|The {{estimated}} cost {{to clean up}} debris from the two killer tornadoes was estimated at $500,000. The governor of Wilson County requested that the areas struck by the EF3 tornado and the EF2 prior as disaster areas to allow federal assistance. In Kenly, hospital staff raised about $300 to help a family whose home was completely destroyed. Up to 125 personnel were deployed to check on residents who were still at home and to assist those in need. Several volunteers helped remove trees and debris off roads {{to make way for}} aid. Two Red Cross teams set up a shelter at the Kenly Free Will Baptist Church. During church ceremonies, volunteers organized outside the church to feed residents who lost their homes. A Methodist church group from Virginia arrived in Johnston and Wilson counties the day after the tornadoes to assist with cleanup efforts. A fund was set up for the 11-year-old boy, Joshua Wiggens, who was killed by the Elm City tornado. By November17, the Red Cross funds were depleted funds needed to keep the organization <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> were $38million below what was required. About $20,000 was spent in the charity effort in Kenly and the governor of Wilson County urged residents who were no affected by the storm to send donations to the Red Cross. The lack of funding for the Red Cross prompted the governor to allow up to $28,000 in the state's emergency funds to be used for assistance by the Red Cross. On November21, low-interest loans were approved for residents in the affected counties. Homeowners in Johnston, Franklin, Harnett, Nash, Sampson, Wake, Wayne and Wilson counties were able to apply for loans up to $200,000 to repair storm damage and businesses were allowed to apply for loans up to $2million. On November24, an unknown member of the 82nd Airborne Division donated 50 cases of non-perishable food and water to assist victims of the tornado. The relief goods were dropped off at the J.S. Waters School in Goldston without notice.|$|E

25|$|From 1814, Keats had two bequests, held {{in trust}} for him until his 21st birthday: £800 willed by his {{grandfather}} John Jennings (about £50,000 in today's money) and {{a portion of his}} mother's legacy, £8000 (about £500,000 today), to be equally divided between her living children. It seems he was not told of either, since he never applied for any of the money. Historically, blame has often been laid on Abbey as legal guardian, but he may also have been unaware. William Walton, solicitor for Keats's mother and grandmother, definitely did know and had a duty of care to relay the information to Keats. It seems he did not. The money would have made a critical difference to the poet's expectations. Money was always a great concern and difficulty for him, as he struggled to stay <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> and make his way in the world independently.|$|E

25|$|In 1836, Brown {{moved his}} family to Franklin Mills, Ohio (now known as Kent).

He suffered great financial losses in the economic crisis of 1839, which struck the western states more severely than had the Panic of 1837. Following the heavy borrowing trends of Ohio, many businessmen like Brown trusted too heavily in credit and state bonds and paid dearly for it.

500|$|Even the {{production}} of the offshore oil drilling and petrochemical industries, developed to supply the Caistab, was affected by the 1986 worldwide economic recession.

40|$|We aim to {{shed light}} on the debate among {{policy-makers}} trying to find prescriptions that will take troubled economies <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their <b>debt</b> trap. We do this with a highly stylized two-compartment dynamic model consisting of the stocks of money in Government and Society. The dynamics of the system are described by a simple four-parameter linear system of two differential equations. The solutions are investigated in closed form and provide precisely quantified "escape conditions" from the debt trap: receipts must be slightly larger than outlays and there must be sufficient annual inflows of funds into the system. The model fits the data for the U. S. between 1981 and 2012 with a coefficient of correlation of 0. 996. The model is used to extrapolate the two stocks beyond 2012 with three escape scenarios which shed light on monetary flows needed to take the U.
