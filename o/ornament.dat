40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the results of}} a {{microscopic}} analysis of <b>ornaments</b> from the Dutch Funnel Beaker culture (3350 - 2750 cal. BC) are presented. It is tried to get {{a better understanding of the}} meaning of the TRB <b>ornaments.</b> By using the concept of cultural biography of objects, insight is gained into how <b>ornaments</b> were treated during this period. Several patterns were distinguished in the choice of raw material, the shape of <b>ornaments,</b> the amount of use and the deposition of <b>ornaments.</b> Most <b>ornaments</b> were made of amber, followed by jet and stone. A strong preference for disc-shaped beads was observed, followed by cylindrical-shaped beads. Other shapes, such as pendants, were only sporadically observed. The technological analysis resulted in the conclusion that <b>ornaments</b> were made following a rather straightforward production sequence of cutting, grinding and biconical perforating. Almost all <b>ornaments</b> were used to some degree. No clear pattern was found as to how, how long and how many <b>ornaments</b> were worn by a single individual. The few indications suggest a variety of ways to wear <b>ornaments.</b> After use, more than half of all <b>ornaments</b> were reground. Dutch Funnel Beaker <b>ornaments</b> are mainly found in the hunebedden. During social gatherings burials and rituals were performed at these megalithic structures, emphasizing and reinforcing the collective identity of the social group. It has been argued that the axes, flints and pottery deposited commemorated communal values, beliefs and activities. In this thesis a similar interpretation is suggested for the amber and jet <b>ornaments.</b> The only local source of amber and jet during the Dutch TRB was the coastal area. Exploiting this area was an important part of TRB existence. It is argued that the specific provenance of amber and jet would have created an association between this material and the coastal area. In this manner the <b>ornaments</b> could have come to symbolize the activity of travelling to and from and exploiting the coast. And in my opinion the <b>ornaments</b> in the hunebedden refer to this aspect of everyday life...|$|R

Other parts of the protocol specify the finial (the metal <b>ornament</b> on a flag pole) as diamond-shaped and colored in a yellow metal. In this diamond there is a five-pointed star (similar to that used in national emblem). The diamond-pattern represents another continuation of Soviet flag-traditions.|$|E

5|$|Printed pattern {{books were}} not easily obtainable, and a sampler or {{embroidered}} record of stitches and patterns {{was the most}} common form of reference. 16th-century English samplers were stitched on a narrow band of fabric and totally covered with stitches.

These samplers were stitched using a variety of needlework styles, threads, and <b>ornament.</b>|$|E
5|$|Regularity {{and order}} are common {{features}} in Toraja wood carving (see table below), {{as well as}} abstracts and geometrical designs.

5|$|The Ballroom, {{the last}} of the palace's three largest rooms, (illustrated below) was {{designed}} by Robillon in 1760. To create this oval room the architect combined five smaller rooms. The ormolu Rococo <b>ornament</b> takes the form of heavy gilding to the walls and ceiling, of such richness that it has been compared with that of François de Cuvilliés' Amalienburg at Schloss Nymphenburg.

The inner walls were covered with paintings, the floor consisting of the gravestones of clergymen and distinguished noblemen. A unique round baptismal chapel was built {{in the second half of}} the 14th century.|$|E
40|$|A {{critical}} factor that distinguishes modern humans, Homo sapiens, from animals {{is the ability}} to communicate using symbols. One example is the use of personal <b>ornaments.</b> People in all cultures use personal <b>ornaments</b> to express something about themselves, and a wide range of functions and meanings can be applied to different ornamentation. The personal <b>ornaments</b> from three Later Stone Age sites in the Blomboschfontein Region, southern Cape, South Africa were analysed in order to determine variation within the manufacture of the <b>ornaments,</b> and how these functioned symbolically within the Later Stone Age society. The makers of these <b>ornaments</b> were the San, the indigenous people of southern Africa. The first method applied is microscopic analyses of the <b>ornaments</b> recovered from the sites to confirm their authenticity and to examine the manufacturing techniques used, as well as a range of possible functions of the <b>ornaments.</b> Ethnographic analogy from contemporary Khoesan culture is used as the second method in this thesis to establish the reasons for and the symbolic systems behind the manufacture and use of the <b>ornaments...</b>|$|R
