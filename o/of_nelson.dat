5|$|Nelson F.C. is an English semi-professional {{association}} {{football club}} {{based in the}} town <b>of</b> <b>Nelson,</b> Lancashire. Founded in 1881, the club played friendly matches for its first eight years, before {{becoming one of the}} founder members of the Lancashire League in 1889. The team won the Lancashire League title in 1896, but disbanded in late 1898 and was suspended by the Lancashire Football Association following incidents involving fans at an FA Cup defeat at Southport Central. Nelson was accepted back into the Lancashire League the following season and in 1901, they joined the Lancashire Combination. Between 1915 and 1918, the team ceased play for the First World War. When competitive football restarted in England in 1919, they joined the Central League. Two seasons later, the club was invited {{to be one of the}} founder teams of the Football League Third Division North. They won the league in 1923, gaining promotion to the Football League Second Division.

5|$|The 1924–25 {{season was}} the 44th {{in the history}} <b>of</b> <b>Nelson</b> Football Club, and their fourth as a {{professional}} team in the Football League. The campaign saw the team return to the Third Division North, having finished in the relegation zone of the Second Division in 1923–24. Despite losing only one match all season at Seedhill, Nelson's home ground, the team struggled in away matches. Nelson ended the campaign on 53 points, {{with a record of}} 23 wins, 7 draws and 12 losses, and finished as runners-up to Darlington in the league table. Nelson reached the Sixth Qualifying Round of the FA Cup, beating non-League Winsford United before being knocked out of the competition by Coventry City. The team progressed past {{the first round of the}} Lancashire Senior Cup with a win against Wigan Borough, but were defeated in the following round by Blackburn Rovers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century and early 20th century, Carlton Hill's notoriety as a slum increased. Poverty, drunkenness, disease and low living {{standards}} were rife. Brighton's reputation was damaged by a disparaging article in The Lancet in 1882: making reference to Carlton Hill, it criticised the town's poor standards of health. Assisted by government funding, Brighton Corporation undertook extensive slum clearance from 1928 until {{the start of}} World War II, transforming the area's appearance. Two large blocks of flats—Brighton Corporation's first council flats—were built to rehouse many of the displaced residents. The Milner Flats, a long four-storey block, stand {{on the site of}} Woburn Place, and were completed in 1934. Alderman Hugh Milner Black, a Corporation member who campaigned for housing improvements in Brighton, was commemorated in the naming. Kingswood Flats, on the site <b>of</b> <b>Nelson</b> Place and a Primitive Methodist chapel, were built in 1938. The name refers to Minister for Health Kingsley Wood. Some displaced residents were moved out of the area: the new council estates of Whitehawk and Moulsecoomb, built in the 1920s and early 1930s on the fringe of Brighton, accommodated many former Carlton Hill residents. An earlier low-rise development took place in 1931, when the small Tarnerland council estate was built on empty land near Tilbury Place.|$|E
