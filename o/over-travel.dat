40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{eliminate}} unnecessary table-over-travel of a surface grinding machine, the authors previously developed an adaptive table-reciprocation-control system using a hydrophone. The system eliminated the <b>over-travel</b> and reduced grinding time by 20 - 40 %. However, during {{the stage of}} the grinding-wheel approach to a workpiece the system did not work. In order to improve the efficiency and reliability of the system, a fluid-flow stabilizer and a new coolant-supply nozzle have been developed and their performances were experimentally investigated. By using these devices, the reciprocation-control system showed its capability even during {{the stage of the}} grinding-wheel approach and this ability improved the system efficiency and reliability...|$|E

40|$|In {{this growing}} world of technology, design and {{manufacturing}} at the nano and micro level {{we need the}} things (product, service, design, technology) more accurate and defect free and on the same guidelines this paper revolve around the same concept of advanced and precision manufacturing. Micro Electro Discharge Machining is a market growing processing technology due to the industrial interest and {{the increasing number of}} applications. Micro Electric Discharge Machining appears to be very promising as a future micro-machining technique, since in many areas of applications it offers several advantages, which include higher machining rate, better precision and control, and a wide range of materials that can be machined. This requires advancement of micro manufacturing processes; hence industrial research on micro-machining has become considerably important and widespread. Manufacturing of micro holes by using Micro Electric Discharge Machining (Micro-EDM) is one of the topics towards developing micro manufacturing technology. Consequently, disastrous range of parameters which lead to defect formation inside the hole are found to be due to long pulse duration (> 500 ns) together with higher gain (> 15). In addition, entrance and exit diameters of through micro-holes are also measured and experimental data are discussed. Conclusively <b>over-travel</b> of tool electrode or secondary machining with a new electrode is recommended to obtain straighter walls and fine surface in micro-holes. Aspect ratios above 15 are obtained easily by using tool electrode with a diameter equal to or less than 75 �m in blind holes. The topic is investigated experimentally and extensively in this work...|$|E
40|$|This {{circular}} {{serves as}} a guide to all the parties involved in the design, manufacture, installation and operation of residential and industrial gates. 2. Four accidents occurred in 2011 that involved the toppling of sliding gates at entrances to buildings. One worker was killed while four others were injured in the accidents. Details of the accidents are appended in Appendix 1 for information. 3. Gates are common features in buildings. Gate toppling accidents could have been easily prevented if safety considerations had been made and implemented at the gate design, installation, operation and maintenance stages. (I) Design Phase 4. All gates should be designed such that their installation, maintenance and operation can be carried out safely. The following should be considered when designing the gate: A. Gate structures should be structurally stable and designed in accordance to prevailing structural codes (eg. BS 5950, EC 3). B. Manually operated gates should be designed such that the force, to open or close it, is restricted to 150 N for residential property gates and 260 N per person for commercial/ industrial property gates. C. Guides and stoppers should be adequately designed and sized to ensure that the gate will not <b>over-travel</b> nor will it topple in the event of derailment during operation. D. Housings for motors of electrical gates should be standalone elements and not have dual usage as stoppers or guides for the gates. This is to ensure that the gates remain safe for use in the event the motors and housings are removed for maintenance. E. The gates (including door leaves, handles and fittings) should be designed such that the risk to the users having their hands crushed, cut or trapped is minimized. This could b...|$|E
40|$|Suspended seats perform two functions: Reduce {{effect of}} {{occasional}} large bumps; Reduce more continuous vibration {{at a lower}} level. The former needs high damping. The latter needs low damping. For most mobile work machines the inevitable compromise is generally better than a simple cushion seat, because that amplifies vibration at around 4 Hz which is a sensitive frequency for human vertical WBV. Why have standard tests for seat suspensions? 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Seat suspensions are non-linear so any measure of performance depends on operating conditions. For comparison these need to be defined. 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Seat manufacturers need benchmarks for product development; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Machine makers choose dynamic characteristics appropriate to their products; 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 Occupational health specialists wish to control operator exposure to Standard tests should be representative, repeatable and reproducible. These requirements are reviewed {{in relation to the}} history of seat test standards and the current position. Current position and history The current position is that we have standard tests for seats for agricultural tractors, earthmoving machinery, industrial (fork-lift) trucks. These tests comprise measurement of vibration transmission and of the rate of damping. Current standards developed as the technology developed, starting around 1960 : 1. Test on machine driven over standard surface 1. 2. Test on shaker reproducing standard surface. 3. Shaker input replaced by representative spectrum 2. 4. Human subject replaced by dynamic dummy. (Not yet settled). Are standard tests representative? The development process has gradually moved seat tests further from reality. 4 hr samples of work exposure suggest that seats do not on average provide large reductions of vertical WBV 3. For specific magnitudes of vibration they can work well. For low vibration, performance is reduced by friction and for severe vibration by length of travel. Recent work has led to a new test to quantify how a suspension controls <b>over-travel</b> 9...|$|E
40|$|Electromechanical probing {{applications}} continuously require smaller pitches, faster {{manufacturing and}} lower electrical resistance. Conventional techniques, such as MEMS based cantilever probes have their shortcomings {{in terms of}} the lowest pitch that can be achieved, cost and yield. Given their promising mechanical and electrical properties, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are strong candidates for future probing applications. A new class of metal-CNT hybrid electromechanical probes is presented where vertically aligned carbon nanotube structures, grown with a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique, act as elastic springs, and a metal coating on the probes is used for increased electrical conduction. This design and architecture presents a scalable approach where thousands of probes can be fabricated in very short production times. 1. 5 Ohm resistance and reliable performance for 6000 cycles at 50 [mu]m <b>over-travel</b> was achieved for a column of 200 [mu]m x 200 [mu]m cross-section and 1 plm of Au deposition. In-situ scanning electron microscope mechanical compression tests revealed a unique deformation mechanism of the CNT structures where continued compression results in successive buckle formation which later can serve as micro-bellows and elastic springs. (cont.) A novel stiffness tuning method is presented to control the elastic properties of a given CNT probe by controlling the initial compressing amount. Further stiffness tuning is achieved by changing gas composition during CVD growth where CNT diameter and density is modified. Lateral compression and densification tests show that these CNT structures are highly anisotropic and have very different deformation mechanisms in vertical and lateral directions. Mechanical properties resulting from two main CVD growth techniques, namely fixed catalyst where a thin film of catalyst layer is deposited onto the growth substrate, and floating catalyst where the catalyst particles are introduced in the gas phase, are compared. It is found that floating catalyst CVD growth yields much stiffer structures due to the relatively larger CNT diameters. As the adhesion of CNT structures to the growth substrate is very weak and the support layer is typically an insulator, a versatile transfer printing technique is developed which enables simultaneous placement and reinforcement of the probes {{on a wide range of}} substrates, including metals and printed circuit boards. Electromechanical performance and failure mechanisms of fully functional metal-CNT hybrid probes are presented. by Onnik Yaglioglu. Thesis (Ph. D.)
