2500|$|Other issues {{threatened}} {{to raise the}} cost of the hotel and put its viability in question as well. A new sticking point was how many rooms the hotel would have to set aside each night for convention business. Marriott and its finance partners wanted fewer rooms dedicated to convention business so that its <b>operating</b> <b>margins</b> would be higher. Marriott also wanted to build multiple mid-size meeting rooms rather a few large ballrooms. No agreement had been reached on these issues by February 2007, despite several months of negotiations. However, the two sides did agree that the underground portion of the hotel would include a [...] meeting center that would include at least one ballroom and multiple meeting rooms. The long negotiations were, according to RLJ Development executives, leading to higher costs and could lead Marriott and its partners to ask for more public money. The negotiations did not seem to impede construction, however. Construction on the hotel was scheduled to begin in early 2010 in time for a late 2011 opening.|$|E

40|$|Several safety-net {{hospitals}} have {{closed in the}} United States, but the scholarly literature does not adequately explain why. This study examines {{the relationship between the}} operational status (open or closed) of safety-net hospitals and unemployment, median household income, gross profit <b>margin,</b> efficiency ratio, <b>operating</b> <b>margin,</b> excess margin, and salary and benefit expenses per full-time equivalent. Study data were collected and analyzed by means of a logistic regression analysis. A significant relationship between hospital operational status and unemployment, <b>operating</b> <b>margin,</b> and salary and benefit expenses per full-time equivalent was indicated in this study. A safety-net hospital closure model was developed that showed that unemployment, <b>operating</b> <b>margin,</b> and salary and benefit expenses per full-time equivalent had a direct impact on hospital closures. Safety-net hospitals that experience upward trends in the unemployment rate in the areas they serve and have a poor <b>operating</b> <b>margin</b> and high salary and benefit expenses that make them more likely to close. This study provides supporting data to hospital administrators so decisions can be made to avoid future safety-net hospital closures. Information from this research can also provide legislators information and data as to why safety-net hospitals close and used as a tool for health care reform...|$|R
