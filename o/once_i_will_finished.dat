5000|$|Clavell {{described}} his process:All I do is write stories. It's {{very difficult to}} get people to read these days with television and the like. My intention is to entertain, perhaps illuminate. If I can transplant people into that buccaneering society of Hong Kong, 1963, maybe they'll get something out of it. If someone pays money for my book and feels satisfied, I'm doing my job.. Writing is rewriting... writing is thinking... If you're lucky, you can start dreaming about a book, and if you're very lucky, you want to wake up... My attitude is positive, romantic. I write about men and women who like men and women. I don't write about psychiatric things, like finding the eternal answer to what is life.The novel was 1,200 pages. It had been reduced 30% with the help of Clavell's editor, Jena Bernkopf. [...] "These things go on until they end," [...] said Clavell about the length. [...] "My secret is I never know what's going to happen from day to day. The last page is all that matters. The rest of it is wind. I only know that <b>once</b> <b>I</b> start, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>finish...</b> People now tell me it ends too soon." ...|$|R
