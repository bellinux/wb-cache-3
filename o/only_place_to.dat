Strode Theatre, linked to the Crispin School and Strode College complex, is now the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> see films, exhibitions and live performances. It opened on 5 October 1963 with a performance by the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra. In 1999 the theatre was expanded with a new foyer, bar and box office along with improved rehearsal space and stage access, {{at a cost of}} £750,000 by the Steel, Coleman Davis partnership who received an award for the design. The expansion was funded by the Arts Council England.|$|E
5|$|In Puerto Rico, boxing is {{considered}} a major sport, having produced more amateur and professional world champions than any other sport in its history. Puerto Rico ranks 5th worldwide between countries with most boxing world champions, and is the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> have champions accredited {{in all of the}} current boxing divisions. This number also places the archipelago in the global lead in terms of champions per capita. February 9, 2008 {{was the first time that}} boxers from Puerto Rico had held three of the four major welterweights titles (World Boxing Association, International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Organization) when Carlos Quintana defeated Paul Williams to join Miguel Cotto, and Kermit Cintron as champions in the division.|$|E

25|$|The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection {{concluded}} that Marcellus gas wells caused dissolved methane to contaminate up to 15 domestic water wells in Dimock Township, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania. This conclusion is disputed by Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., which was cited for causing the contamination. It is also disputed by other long-term area residents who noted that high methane levels {{had been present}} for more than 60 years prior to hydrofracking in Dimock.

500|$|The Southern Railway (SR), {{successor}} {{to both the}} L and the LB under the 1923 grouping of railways, objected to the plan to extend the C line to Sutton [...] Sir Herbert Walker, General Manager of the SR, described the proposals as an [...] "invasion" [...] of the SR's territory allocated by the grouping agreement. Walker proposed a limited extension of the CS as far as Tooting and offered to allow the C's tube trains to run to Wimbledon via {{a connection to the}} SR's Tooting to Wimbledon line. He also proposed that the SR should build the W instead. The UERL rejected Walker's plan, claiming that the entire extension to Morden was needed as that was the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> build the necessary depot. Without the compromise arrangement, the House of Lords rejected the whole scheme but the House of Commons, which wanted the tube service to be extended from Clapham, encouraged further negotiations between the UERL and SR.|$|E
500|$|The Horncastle Canal {{was being}} {{constructed}} {{at the same}} time, and the two companies negotiated to find an engineer who would oversee both projects. They approached Henry Eastburn, {{but he did not}} accept, and so William Cawley from Mickle Trafford in Cheshire was appointed. Five locks were required to negotiate the mills, and there were additional locks at Lower Kyme and near Flax Dyke, in the parish of Ewerley. They were built as broad locks, , and the total fall from Sleaford was [...] Six contracts with a total value of £4,000, for the construction of locks and bridges, were awarded to John Dyson Sr., who worked with Peter Tyler and John Langwith. Defects were reported with the lock at Haverholme in 1794, and when the opening of the canal was announced, Dyson produced advertisements which stated that the canal would not open unless he was paid for the work he had carried out. The company responded that the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> sort out such disagreements was in a law court, and the opening went ahead on 6 May 1794. The enabling act specified that the terminus would be at Castle Causeway, from where it would follow the southern mill stream to pass through the south bridge, and then along the Sleaford millstream through Old Sleaford and New Sleaford. Financial difficulties meant that it stopped short of its intended terminus, and instead the company built a wharf to the east of what is now Carre Street in Sleaford.|$|E
50|$|As lead {{climbing}} {{does not}} require a pre-placed anchor {{at the top of the}} route, it is often seen as less restricted than top roping. Also, because a lead climber does not have an anchor point above them while climbing, only the limbs and body of the climber are used to effect upward progress. Carabiners are <b>only</b> <b>placed</b> <b>to</b> catch the climber in the event of a fall.|$|R

60|$|But {{even the}} {{subjects}} which belong by {{rights to the}} ear can nevertheless be taught by the eye more readily. Everybody knows how much {{easier it is to}} get up the history and geography of a country when you are actually in it than when you are merely reading about it. It lives and moves before you. The places, the persons, the monuments, the events, all become real to you. Each illustrates each, and each tends to impress the other on the memory. Sight burns them into the brain without conscious effort. You can learn more of Egypt and of Egyptian history, culture, hieroglyphics, and language in a few short weeks at Luxor or Sakkarah than in a year at the Louvre and the British Museum. The Tombs of the Kings are worth many papyri. The mere sight of the temples and obelisks and monuments and inscriptions, in the places where their makers originally erected them, gives a sense of reality and interest to them all that no amount of study under alien conditions can possibly equal. We have all of us felt that the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> observe Flemish art to the greatest advantage is at Ghent and Bruges and Brussels and Antwerp; just as the <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> learn Florentine art as it really was is at the Uffizi and the Bargello.|$|E

6000|$|Fleda had fully recognized, {{the first}} days, that, {{quite apart from}} any {{question}} of letting Owen know where she was, {{it would be a}} charity to give him some sign: it would be weak, it would be ugly, to be diverted from that kindness by the fact that Mrs. Gereth had attached a tinkling bell to it. A frank relation with him was only superficially discredited: she ought for his own sake to send him a word of cheer. So she repeatedly reasoned, but she as repeatedly delayed performance: if her general plan had been to be as still as a mouse, an interview like the interview at Ricks would be an odd contribution to that ideal. Therefore with a confused preference of practice to theory she let the days go by; she felt that nothing was so imperative as the gain of precious time. She shouldn't be able to stay with her father forever, but she might now reap the benefit of having married her sister. Maggie's union had been built up round a small spare room. Concealed in this apartment she might try to paint again, and abetted by the grateful Maggie--for Maggie at least was grateful--she might try to dispose of her work. She had not indeed struggled with a brush since her visit to Waterbath, where the sight of the family splotches had put her immensely on her guard. Poynton moreover had been an impossible place for producing; no active art could flourish there but a Buddhistic contemplation. It had stripped its mistress clean of all feeble accomplishments; her hands were imbrued neither with ink nor with water-color. Close to Fleda's present abode was the little shop of a man who mounted and framed pictures and desolately dealt in artists' materials. She sometimes paused before it to look at a couple of shy experiments for which its dull window constituted publicity, small studies placed there for sale and full of warning to a young lady without fortune and without talent. Some such young lady had brought them forth in sorrow; some such young lady, to see if they had been snapped up, had passed and repassed as helplessly as she herself was doing. They never had been, they never would be, snapped up; yet they were quite above the actual attainment of some other young ladies. It was a matter of discipline with Fleda to take an occasional lesson from them; besides which, when she now quitted the house, she had to look for reasons after she was out. The <b>only</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> find them was in the shop-windows. They made her feel like a servant-girl taking her [...] "afternoon," [...] but that didn't signify: perhaps some day she would resemble such a person still more closely. This continued a fortnight, {{at the end of which}} the feeling was suddenly dissipated. She had stopped as usual in the presence of the little pictures; then, as she turned away, she had found herself face to face with Owen Gereth.|$|E
