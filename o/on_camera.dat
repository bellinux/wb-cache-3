In mid-January, the crew reconvened in Hollywood {{with some of the}} teenage actors for five weeks of post-production photography.|$|E

At brief times during the performance, the video recorded a moment of white <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> or a dark screen, {{both of which were}} related to the use of strobe lights.

5|$|Based on the {{information}} his journalists had gathered from eyewitnesses in Gibraltar and that provided by the Spanish authorities, Bolton believed his team had enough to broadcast a documentary about the Gibraltar shootings. The journalists filmed those eyewitnesses {{who were willing to}} speak <b>on</b> <b>camera.</b> They also rented a helicopter, and—with the assistance of the Spanish authorities, who provided two police officers who had taken part in the operation—filmed a reconstruction of the Spanish surveillance operation.|$|E

5|$|Cannibal Holocaust {{achieved}} notoriety as its graphic violence aroused a {{great deal}} of controversy. After its premiere in Italy, it was ordered to be seized by a local magistrate, and Deodato was arrested on obscenity charges. He was later charged with making a snuff film due to rumors that claimed some actors were killed <b>on</b> <b>camera.</b> Although Deodato was later cleared, the film was banned in Italy, Australia, and several other countries due to its portrayal of graphic brutality, sexual assault, and real depictions of violence toward animals. Some nations have since revoked the ban, though it is still upheld in several countries. Critics have suggested that the film is a commentary about civilized versus uncivilized society.|$|E

5|$|Chaplin {{had interviewed}} several actresses {{to play the}} blind flower girl but was unimpressed with them all. While seeing a film shoot with bathing women in a Santa Monica beach, he found a casual acquaintance, Virginia Cherrill. Cherrill waved {{and asked if she}} would ever get the chance to work with him. After a series of poor auditions from other actresses, Chaplin {{eventually}} invited her to do a screen test. She was the first actress to subtly and convincingly act blind <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> due to her near-sightedness, and Cherrill signed a contract on November 1, 1928.|$|E

Eventually, Wells meets his lawyers and tells them about the nanny cam. However, it turns out that it is Wednesday: Wells is somehow “living the week backwards”.|$|E
5|$|Obayashi {{already had}} {{experience}} with special effects {{from his work}} on television commercials. Obayashi and the cameraman oversaw the special effects for the film. Obayashi desired the special effects to look unrealistic, as if a child created them. For the scene in which Ai Matsubara's character vanishes under the blood, Obayashi had her suspended nude, pouring buckets of blue paint on her to create a blue-screen chroma key effect where the blue colored parts of her body would deteriorate <b>on</b> <b>camera.</b> The outcome {{of a lot of}} these effects would be unknown until the film was completed. Obayashi stated that sometimes the effects did not turn out how he originally envisioned them.|$|E

Through Leonid Tyagachev, then head of the Russian Olympic Committee, Putin told the team to stop chewing gum and to sing the anthem. Gennady Shvets, then the Russian Olympic Committee's press chief, denied being contacted by the Kremlin but said he was aware of displeasure with the players' behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Rivette {{was unhappy}} with La Religieuse and re-evaluated his career, {{developing}} a unique cinematic style with L'Amour fou. Influenced by the political turmoil of May 1968, improvisational theater and an in-depth interview with Jean Renoir, Rivette began working with large groups of actors on character development and allowing events to unfold <b>on</b> <b>camera.</b> This technique led to the thirteen-hour Out 1. His films of the 1970s, such as Celine and Julie Go Boating, often incorporated fantasy and were better-regarded. After attempting to make four consecutive films, however, Rivette had a nervous breakdown and his career slowed for several years, with films such as Merry-Go-Round and Le Pont du Nord being difficult productions.|$|E
5|$|Scott avoided using green screens unless necessary. Instead, he used various items so {{the actors}} would {{know where they}} should be looking in any {{particular}} scene on the practical sets where CGI elements would be inserted in post-production. Rapace said that green screens were used fewer than six times during filming. The production used five 3ality Technical Atom 3D rigs, four of which were configured with Red Epic 3D cameras set <b>on</b> <b>camera</b> dollies and tripods, which were continuously in use during filming. The fifth rig used an Epic camera as a steadicam, which was used only occasionally.|$|E
5|$|Some {{participants}} {{tried to}} track Russian down {{to have their}} questions answered.

Another participant, Daniel Pope, managed to track Russian down to an address in Richmond upon Thames and convinced him to be interviewed by Christmas TV and apologise <b>on</b> <b>camera.</b> As Russian had not actually taken money from his victims, he had not committed a crime, and a civil case was not pursued {{due to a lack of}} funds.|$|E
50|$|The EF-S-mount is a newer {{subset of}} the EF standard, {{introduced}} in 2003. EF-S lenses can only be used <b>on</b> Canon digital <b>cameras</b> that use the APS-C sensor, for example the 400D (EOS Digital Rebel XTi) and the 40D. EF-S lenses can be distinguished by a white dot on the mount ring, {{as opposed to the}} red dot seen on standard EF lenses. Note that while an EF-S lens cannot be mounted <b>on</b> a <b>camera</b> that uses the EF mount, EF lenses can be mounted <b>on</b> <b>cameras</b> designed for the EF-S standard: for this reason, EF-S cameras carry both a red dot and a white dot on the mount.|$|R
