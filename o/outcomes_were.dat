5|$|Several {{studies of}} young adults who had used AAC since {{childhood}} report a generally good quality of life, though few lived independently, or were in paid employment. The young adults used multiple modes of communication including aided and unaided AAC approaches. More positive quality of life outcomes often correlated with better quality of communication and interaction, as well as personal characteristics, family and community support, and excellent AAC services. Poorer <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> related to {{lack of access to}} appropriate AAC supports and resources, problems with technology and negative attitudes.|$|E

25|$|When treated, the {{prognosis}} is better. In one review, {{the proportion of}} treated ORS cases which reported various <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> assessed. On average, the patients were followed for 21 months (range: 2 weeks to 10 years). With treatment, 30% recovered (i.e. no longer experienced ORS odor beliefs and thoughts of reference), 37% improved and in 33% there was a deterioration in the condition (including suicide) or no change from the pre-treatment status.|$|E
25|$|Nifedipine {{has been}} used {{frequently}} as a tocolytic (agent that delays premature labor). A Cochrane review has concluded that it has benefits over placebo or no treatment for prolongation of pregnancy. It has also benefits over beta-agonists and may also have some benefits over atosiban and magnesium sulphate, although atosiban results in fewer maternal adverse effects. No difference {{was found in the}} rate of deaths among babies around the time of birth, and data on longer-term <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> limited.|$|E
25|$|The {{definitions}} of the outcomes decided upon are subject to interpretation by those implementing them. Across different programs or even different instructors outcomes could be interpreted differently, leading to a difference in education, even though the same <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> said to be achieved. By outlining specific outcomes, a holistic approach to learning is lost. Learning can find itself reduced to something that is specific, measurable, and observable. As a result, outcomes are not yet widely recognized as a valid way of conceptualizing what learning is about.|$|E

50|$|Therefore, {{the term}} {{learning}} <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> replacing objective in some educational organisations. In some organisations the term learning <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> {{used in the}} part of a course description where aims are normally found. One can equate aims to intended learning outcomes and objectives to measured learning outcomes. A third category of learning <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> the unintended learning outcome which would include beneficial <b>outcomes</b> that <b>were</b> neither planned nor sought but are simply observed.|$|R
25|$|A {{more recent}} study on motor {{functional}} recovery after {{spinal cord injuries}} in mice showed that after human-induced pluripotent stem cells were transplanted into the mice, the cells differentiated into three neural lineages in the spinal cord. The cells stimulated regrowth of the damaged spinal cord, maintained myelination, and formed synapses. These positive <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> observed for over 112 days after the spinal cord injury, without tumor formation. Nevertheless, a follow-up study by the same group showed distinct clones of human-induced pluripotent stem cells eventually formed tumors.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{interactions}} between extraversion, neuroticism, and conscientiousness have demonstrated significant impacts on subjective-well being. In one study, researchers used three scale to assess subjective well-being. They found that extraversion only {{served as a}} predictor for one assessment, in conjunction with neuroticism, while the other two assessment <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> better predicted by conscientiousness and neuroticism. In addition {{to the importance of}} including other factors in happiness assessments, this study also demonstrates the manner in which an operational definition of well-being changes whether extraversion emerges as a salient predictive factor.|$|E
25|$|Some {{standard}} {{methods of}} ensuring allocation concealment include sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes (SNOSE); sequentially numbered containers; pharmacy controlled randomization; and central randomization. It {{is recommended that}} allocation concealment methods be included in an RCT's protocol, and that the allocation concealment methods should be reported in detail in a publication of an RCT's results; however, a 2005 study determined that most RCTs have unclear allocation concealment in their protocols, in their publications, or both. On the other hand, a 2008 study of 146 meta-analyses concluded {{that the results of}} RCTs with inadequate or unclear allocation concealment tended to be biased toward beneficial effects only if the RCTs' <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> subjective as opposed to objective.|$|E

25|$|In an {{examination}} of all causes of stillbirth and infant mortality in Cumbria taken as a whole, between 1950 and 1993, 4,325 stillbirths, 3,430 neonatal death and 1,569 lethal congenital anomalies, occurred among 287,993 births. Overall, results did not infer {{an increased risk of}} still birth or neonatal death in Cumbria, the rate of these negative <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> largely in line with the British baseline rate. However, there was a cautioned connection between a small excess of increased risk of death from lethal congenital anomalies and proximity to municipal waste incinerators and chemical waste crematoriums being noted.

25|$|Observation {{with close}} imaging {{follow-up}} {{may be used}} in select cases if a meningioma is small and asymptomatic. In a retrospective study on 43 patients, 63% of patients were found to have no growth on follow-up, and the 37% found to have growth at an average of 4nbsp&mm / year. In this study, younger patients were found to have tumors that {{were more likely to have}} grown on repeat imaging; thus are poorer candidates for observation. In another study, clinical <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> compared for 213 patients undergoing surgery vs. 351 patients under watchful observation. Only 6% of the conservatively treated patients developed symptoms later, while among the surgically treated patients, 5.6% developed persistent morbid condition, and 9.4% developed surgery-related morbid condition.|$|E
25|$|A study {{conducted}} by Long claimed support for Cooper, Pruitt et al. {{in the use of}} personas. In a partially controlled study, a group of students were asked to solve a design brief; two groups used personas while one group did not. The students who used personas were awarded higher course evaluations than the group who did not. Students who used personas were assessed as having produced designs with better usability attributes than students who did not use personas. The study also suggests that using personas may improve communication between design teams and facilitate user-focused design discussion. The study had several limitations: <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> assessed by a professor and students who were not blind to the hypothesis, students were assigned to groups in a non-random fashion, the findings were not replicated, and other contributing factors or expectation effects (e.g., the Hawthorne effect or Pygmalion effect) were not controlled for.|$|E

50|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish a self-defeating prophecy from a self-fulfilling prophecy that predicts a negative outcome. If a prophecy of a negative <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> made, and that negative <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> achieved {{as a result of}} positive feedback, then it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, if a group of people decide {{they will not be able}} to achieve a goal and stop working towards the goal as a result, their prophecy was self-fulfilling. Likewise, if a prediction of a negative <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> made, but the <b>outcome</b> <b>is</b> positive because of negative feedback resulting from the rebellion, then that is a self-defeating prophecy.|$|R

25|$|One small 2009 {{double-blind}} study of autistic children found that 40 hourly treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres provided {{significant improvement in}} the children's behavior immediately after treatment sessions but this study has not been independently confirmed. More recent, relatively large-scale controlled studies have also investigated HBOT using treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres and have found less promising results. A 2010 {{double-blind study}} compared HBOT to a placebo treatment in children with autistic disorder. Both direct observational measures of behavioral symptoms and standardized psychological assessments were {{used to evaluate the}} treatment. No {{differences were found between the}} HBOT group and the placebo group on any of the outcome measures. A second 2011 single-subject design study also investigated the effects of 40 HBOT treatments of 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheres on directly observed behaviors using multiple baselines across 16 participants. Again, no consistent <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> observed across any group and further, no significant improvements were observed within any individual participant. Together these studies suggest that HBOT at 24% oxygen at 1.3 atmospheric pressure does not result in a clinically significant improvement of the behavioral symptoms of autistic disorder.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{definition}} of compatibilism and incompatibilism, the literature often fails to distinguish between physical determinism and higher level forms of determinism (predeterminism, theological determinism, etc.) As such, hard determinism with respect to theological determinism (or [...] "Hard Theological Determinism" [...] above) might be classified as hard incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism (if no claim was made regarding the internal causality or determinism of the universe), or even compatibilism (if freedom from the constraint of determinism was not considered necessary for free will), if not hard determinism itself. By the same principle, metaphysical libertarianism (a form of incompatibilism with respect to physical determinism) might be classified as compatibilism with respect to theological determinism (if it was assumed such free will events were pre-ordained and therefore were destined to occur, but of which whose <b>outcomes</b> <b>were</b> not [...] "predestined" [...] or determined by God).
